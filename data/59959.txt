I've realized I just don't like these hide-and-seek games. Dracula is just awful as a prime example, but mainly that was due to FFG's over design of combat and stupid filigree of Arkham Horror-like items and systems. Blah! But then Whitechapel comes along with a stream-lined version of the system: you're just trying to find Jack and he's just trying to get away. The set of nights are all a build up to the final night - where Jack will be extremely hard pressed to kill and escape. Love the tension and the wow production. I can't imagine a better version of hide-an-seek. But gain, I just don't think I like these games, so this is probably as good as it gets for me.

RATING: 8
An absolutely wonderful deduction game, at least for two players. The fact that you need a little luck to find the blood trail and the complex layout of the map keep things interesting. The options are so many and the situation is ever evolving, which precludes you from experiencing that tedious phase of the typical deduction game when you're basically just trying to find the question that eliminates the most dead ends. In practice, frustration and analysis paralysis won't take over you during playing Letters from Whitechapel because not coming up with the most effective question does not make you feel stupid or having lost the game.

The game is interesting for both, the police and Jack players. There is a thick layer of metagaming which helps with immersion immensely. It is not just a question of mechanically converging towards the solution, but you actually have to guess what your opponent is up to. This is something that makes the game more authentic. You can actually feel the heat of the chase, try to pull off the wittiest of bluffs or just simply panic.

A great game truly.

*Rating based on one play.

Interesting logic and deduction game.  It was a fun play with lots of tension, but the play time is very long and I don't see it getting to the table much.  Many reviewers have said it's not very good with more than two players, but we played with 5 and found it interesting.  If you don't have a problem with a bossy player in cooperative games, it shouldn't be a problem here.  (And if you do have a bossy player, make them Jack!)

A clever twist on the Scotland Yard/Mr X mechanic but still suffers a bit from the length and it's really a 2 (and at a stretch 3) player game. Feel there are also some dominant strategies that could lead to repetitive play.

Excellent deduction game that oozes with theme.  Excellent suspense and surprise, provided you don't introduce a lot of the house variants that are swimming around which more or less reduce the whole game to putting together a puzzle (detectives making copious notes in notebooks, marking off all possible positions of Jack on laminated mini-versions of the map, etc.).  

The major drawback of this game is its length (primarily a problem if more than one player are splitting the role of the detectives).  For what can be a 2-3 hour time investment, I'd normally like a game to be a little more meaty.  Works great (and plays more quickly) as a two-player game (at the cost that a single mental error on the part of the detectives may not be noticed immediately and may effectively ruin the chances of catching Jack).

I prefer this game over Fury of Dracula as the prey.  Jack can't fight back (or leave obstacles) but the coaches and alleyway shortcuts give Jack more ways to elude the detectives.

That may change as the detective players gain experience, but supposedly Jack will get craftier too.

RATING: 7
Letters from Whitechapel is an interesting game and what I enjoy the most about it is the historical feel that it has. The map is a close replica of the real Whitechapel, the spots where the wretched are placed are the places where the real victims were murdered, the policemen are exactly those who chased Jack... and so on. Also the visual impact of the game, while not outstanding, is still very intriguing.

As far as gameplay is concerned, the mechanics on their own are very simple, but it's so fascinating to engage in this deduction challenge with all the outguessing and all the tactics involved. This brings me to my only concern about the game. The depth and the enjoyment that Letters from Whitechapel can offer really depends on the people you're playing with. If either side is playing poorly, it gets too easy for the other and immediately the game feels flat... and the repetitive nature of the mechanics will not compensate for it at all. 

Letters from Whitechapel doesn't offer lots of strategies or dynamic gameplay, but it provides a very tense experience. It's particularly good with 2 players and it can be very challenging when everyone is familiar with it, in which case it's overall MUCH better. It's a very good game, but after 14 plays I just don't feel that itch to play it anymore. It's not a game I want to hang on to, especially because I want to keep my game collection within the borders that reason dictates.

I bet this game is a lot of fun as Jack, but as one of the police investigators, it seemed very lopsided. The one night we caught onto Jack's trail was exciting, but the other 3 nights were a snooze.

Letters from Whitechapel is a great hidden movement deduction game. The problem with it is the time to play. The game takes a significant amount of time to play and as such I find that the payout for the experience is not worth the time invested to play it. If there was a way to shorten this game a bit I would really love playing it more often.

4 hours of boredom.
Mechanics are almost sound but heavily biased toward Jack.

I love the hidden movement mechanics, and this game implements them really well.
I think playing as Jack is a constant thrill, especially when there is more than one investigator player, so you can hear their planning.
Playing as an investigator can be potentially frustrating when you can't find anything for a few turns in a row, but it gets very rewarding and exciting when eventually a clue pops up.
I love this game and so do my loved ones, so I think we will be playing it often

I am in the camp that house rules can help you get through unforeseen rule omissions. I am fine with rules that allow for variable difficulty. This game seemed to have a bad mix of both in the manual. Mostly because it would be very difficult to evaluate how each of the rules empowers or weakens the two sides and there is also little to know if a particular player or players need one rule or another.

Okay, so the Mr. Jack games aren't deduction games, and then I suppose this one is. I suppose.

I was hoping that this would capture the cat and mouse chase and the deductive elements and everything that I don't usually see in a board game.

This one's been tough so far. It's a bit dry, as all of the moves and actions are just pretty straightforward, with only a few "special powers", which are just shortcuts of a form.

I suppose that this should make the deductive part of the game more compelling, but it feels like a really fragile system.

It's easy for Jack to game the various key spots to make the chase much less interesting. It's pretty easy to lose the trail to make a whole day fruitless. And etc.

So far there hasn't really been any particularly interesting play, but I guess that's the hazard for a game that requires so much fuzzy thought as this (as opposed to some quintessential, perfectly balanced Euro, or something).

This has grown on me a lot. The deduction aspect is just super fun. Has a lot of issues with trackable hidden information being important (we ignore that, but it does disadvantage Jack), but the gameplay is just super engaging.

RATING: 8
Letters is basically a refinement of Scotland Yard, a game I once owned and ultimately didn't enjoy very much.  Recasting Mr X as Jack the Ripper certainly adds a thematic frisson.  Letters starts each of four nights with a murder (or two).  Jack must then return from the scene of the crime to his lair by a suitably circuitous route, evading the police and laying false trails.  Meanwhile, the police try to block strategic intersections and search for clues.  It gets steadily harder for Jack as the game progresses, with fewer potential victims venturing out and fewer carriages and alleys to aid the escape.  An excellent deduction game.

Production quality is very good, while the blood spattered artwork is very evocative.  The rules are admirably clear and concise.

Look - enjoyed playing it but felt it was too abstract in some way. Disappointed it did not bring into play more of the characters and historical figures involved in the tragedy, also why only "four" nights? The case for other Ripper attack or near fatal encounters in strong. Did not get the sense of the poverty, horrid slums of East London and the gin sodden wretches who plyed their trade wearing skirts and boots.  The map is top notch.

RATING: 7
Great deduction game with a gorgeous sturdy board. Skillful game no luck included. They really managed to capture the feeling of tracking down Jack The Ripper. It's really a 2-player game or even 3-player game if you share the cops. Definately not for 4,5,6 players. Nicely balanced. The only minus for me is that it takes 2+ hours to play.

Really good fun, but a little on the long side and can severely favour Jack. Only played 2 player so far so will have to see if more detectives helps this!

Edit: more detectives does not help this.

I have only played this a couple of times, but I liked it. During playing I almost felt I was in the gloomy streets of 19th century London. Strong theme which envelopes you during playing. I would recommend this from 15+ up, because of the violent theme and it requires quite a lot of thinking and concentrating during the whole gaming session, which usually spans for 2 to 3 hours per game. I think that's a little bit too much and at least for my self in my current state of life as a father of a small baby it's almost impossible to play it, or at least you'll not be able to enjoy the atmosphere with constant interruptions. Good game and quite challenging and well balanced.

Nice deduction game. Simple and elegant rules and mechanics that surprisingly well evoke the theme (well, maybe it's the gorgeous map that does this). It can induce some AP though and while tight and even suspenseful it can be frustrating for the police if they fail to pick up a lead early. It's a light game that can easily be introduced to everyone. The manual makes this sound more complex than it is.

The gaming board with the map of Whitechapel is brilliant. You are immediately immersed in the game and relive the Ripper's deeds and the - futile - hunt after this legendary murderer across London. Yes, the Ripper often escapes, as he did in real life.Failure to capture him does not diminish the experience. If you win, you are happy. If you do not, you get a more realistic scenario.
A very elegant hidden movement game.

This game sucks. Let me explain. If the player playing Jack is any level of smart the game breaks. It will be boring for Jack because the cops will never have a chance. You will end up spending an hour or two just writing a series of numbers on a paper and watching the cops wander around uselessly. They will stumble on clues but will never catch you. They are too spread out to be of any use. Far to easy to throw them off. This makes playing Jack suck. It's boring at best.

How about playing the police? Well, how about we just say boring and frustrating. You spend an hour or two taking turns saying...is there a clue at this spot? Is there a clue at this spot? Is there a clue at this spot? You run around slowly and uselessly for an hour or two and your only interaction between players is Jack mostly just saying no. No. No. No. Yes. Really? This was supposed to be fun? 

Let me ask a couple questions here. Why the heck are people rating this game WHO HAVE NOT PLAYED IT! WHY? Your rating of something you know nothing about will effect somebody's decision to buy it. Why do people give it a good rating and then in their review talk about how bad it was. DONT GIVE A GOOD REVIEW IF IT WASNT GOOD! I guess I should have read a lot more into all the comments. I guess a rating can't be trusted. If everybody played before reviewing the game and was honest in their review the rating would drop drastically. Also if people had any idea what ratings meant it would drop. You can't give it high marks on stars and give a crapy review. Lower the stars to match what you actually thought of the game. 

I got this because of the high rating and a favorable review from the Dice Tower. I don't blame the Dice Tower or Tom. He is one guy. He can love the game and I can hate it. But here I thought that nearly 10,000 ratings have to balance out and give an accurate picture of the game. I was wrong.

Strictly a two player game in my eyes, three would be pushing it. I struggle with deduction games but that doesn't dampen my enjoyment of them. A great game, I haven't played as Mr Ripper yet though so I don't know how I'd feel doing seemingly little while the other player sorts the moves out for five detectives.

Very nice game, especially with 2 or 3 players only (I can't really imagine a big party of detectives not being coordinated and speaking too much in front of Jack). Thematic feel is very present and tension is high when we play it.

Have only played as Jack the "Hunted" (really the true victim in this game ;o) At first the map seams so large and easy to escape but the tightening of the net is felt the more rounds are played within the game.

Great cat and mouse deduction game. I love the huge board, love how it's actually based on a map of the real city, and love seeing the bread crumb trail that is created.

Though the game is a little long, it is engaging throughout as you get closer and closer to finding Jack. From my experiences so far, Jack seems to have a little too much power and has yet to lose. The game comes with variants to balance gameplay if either side wins too much. Still need to try those out.

At the time of my exposure to this game, I have little experience with hidden movement deduction games (Fury of Dracula, Scotland Yard, etc).

Somehow, while fun, this game seems to be somewhat too luck (although without chance) based for the detectives, due to the very slow movement and large map (not that fixing either of these will be without even worse side effects).  Even for the Ripper, it seems a little too luck dependent.

I do not always mind luck.  It has its place.  And honestly, this game is its place as well (real detectives and real criminals do have a large "chanceless" luck component to their roles).  But as a game to play for recreation, this misses for.  If it were shorter it would possibly be much better.

However, when enough luck hits right and a good chase is on, then this game has a serious AP threat -- and not a 'deep' AP, just a mechanical turn the crank AP.

Still there is good fun here and the theme for me felt well done.  I won't buy it, but I'll play it again if it comes up.  I would probably rather try Fury of Dracula (if you are going with theme and immersion, that seems even moreso) or Scotland Yard (if not, then this seems the trimmer more elegant take).

Hidden-movement game in which there are no special powers. Pure deduction.

The cops play a strategic long game with a tense tactical end game, and Jack plays a tense tactical game with a small amount of strategy, which invariably goes out the window when the cops do something erratic.

If you make a mistake as Jack, you are fucked.

I would not play this again with any more than 4.  Any more, and there are too many brains on one goal with not enough to do in between turns.

This game is incredibly amazing. There's enough suspense to keep you occupied as police (and it's intellectually stimulating to deduce where Jack is) and as Jack... it's awesomely intense. 

Currently have played it with 6, 5, and 3. Hoping this plays just as well with 2.

Good fun for Jack.  The policement take on lesser roles and involvement like many co-operative games can bew dominated by louder players.  Jack was uncovered in the second round of our first game, although there was some amgiuity as to where the black squares lay, e.g. are there one or two bewtween 139 and 164?  Was critcial!  WE played with 6.  I suspect 2 will be best.

Ez az eddigi legizgibb nyomozós játék, amit próbáltam. Sokban hasonlít a Scotland Yardra, de annál sokkal jobb valamiért. Nem tudom, rendőr szemmel milyen volt, de sorozatgyilkosként hihetetlen stesszes. És mi más számítana, mint ez:) Ez a műfaj erről kell szóljon, nem?

Tetszik, hogy más hálózaton mozog a rendőrség és a bűnöző. Jól meg van csinálva az egész, nem vitték túlzásba, semmi hatásvadász dolog. Azt az 5 passzlehetőséget nem értem, egyszer se kellett...

Na kiderült, mire jó pontosan az öt passz, növeli Jack lehetséges lépésszámát, ez tetszik, bár amúgy is Jack dolga a könnyebb szerintem.

RATING: 7
Deduction game in one of its better incarnations. A great deal of attention must be paid to the board and the possibles routes that one can take, Jack having a lot of space to bluff and mess around with the inspectors out there to get him. The drawback is that the game is somewhat longish (depending on the possible AP or not of the investigation party talking over the possibilities) but the game IS rewarding at the end (for one struggling party at least :P)

Egy nagyon izgalmas 2 személyes játék - többen felesleges leülni mellé. Jó minőségű tartozékok, továbbá egy már korábban ismert mechanizmus (Police07) jellemzik a játékot.
Egyszerűen elmagyarázható és könnyen megérthető szabályrendszere abszolút "fogyaszthatóvá" teszik a játékot kezdők számára is.
Nyelvfüggetlen, hangulatos, és abszolút tematikus.
(update 120414 / valódi feszültségteremtésre képes a játék, nagyon résen kell lennie Jack-nek. A speciális mozgást biztosító tokenek jó időben történő felhasználása lehet a sikeres menekülés kulcsa... Igazán nagyon jó kis nyomozós játék!)

A látszat - és a rendelkezésére álló segítségek - ellenére Jacknek nagyon nehéz dolga van, hiszen a detektívek győzelmi feltétele, ha Jack nem éri el e búvóhelyét bármelyik éjszaka végén. (ismert nyomok alapján a búvóhely körülbelüli lokalizálása után a környék detektívekkel történő megszállásával Jacknek nehéz megbirkóznia)

Bármikor szívesen leülök mellé játszani.

Playing as Jack the Ripper can be very intense and you really do feel like you're on the run. As the inspectors, when the trail runs cold, it can so frustrating, but so thematic.

Deductive game where the policemen try to find Jack's house.  Probably better played with two, since one person per policeman makes everything slow, although can be played in a colaborative way.  I found it extremely difficult and frustrating for the police.  May need much more experience, but if you are unlucky in the first or second turn, goes to a very boring experience.

Cooperative games are usually not my cup of tea and this one is no exception. My rating reflects perspective of playing a constable role in a multiplayer (3 and more players) game.

An AREA deduction game, with a secret pen & paper movement mechanic, like "Escape from the Aliens in outer space". I like the artwork. It is playable, but nothing too exciting. The bad guy is moving secretly after being exposed by performing a series of murders. Each night he has to return to his hideout. The police are trying to place themselves optimally so they either capture him or they deduce out where his hideout is so they can block his way on a later round.

RATING: 8
This is the absolute best game in the chase/deduction genre.

Jack and the Investigators play a very different game, and playing each side is quite a different experience. Anyway, what both sides share is the edge-of-your seat tension all along the game! It's a battle of wits with constant bluffing and trying to be smarter than the opponent(s).

The only major drawback is its lenght: Whitechapel can last 3+ hours, although with all the tension it seems shorter for sure!

Another drawback lies in the "alpha player" problem, common to many coops: there is no mechanic to hinder the dominant/expert player taking over the investigation. But since I guess it will be played mostly 2p or with my alpha-player-only group, I guess this wouldn't be a very big nuisance...

Initial Impression: Beautiful components and simple mechanisms bring out the theme in this game. Every turn Jack murders a victim and the investigators have to quickly pick up the trail and follow it, hoping to determine the location of Jack or his home. The play allows for bluffing and misdirection if played with a skilled Jack player. The rules allow for options to be included in order to adjust the difficulty levels for both factions. I'd like to try this game again as Jack the next time I play.

RATING: 7
First play: Rules are absorbed fairly quickly and they are quite intuitive so 20 mins later we were off.

Yes its very similar to Fury of Dracula and Scotland Yard. However the Ripper has a couple of movement bonuses with the coach and alleys which make him damn near impossible to pin down. The police have to try to locate the Rippers house and so know where he is returning to each night or just plain arrest him by predicting where he is.

In our Game the Ripper won, and it seemed a real struggle for the police to close the net on him. The Ripper moves faster than the Police and the coach and alleys enable him to back track very easily. People are saying its easy to catch the Ripper, after my first game  I must disagree.

Clever and well produced but it seems more exciting to be the Ripper. Lots of banter which was alot of fun but not sure if I'd want to play again.

Great spatial deduction game. Bonus points for excellent art and components. The only reason this game isn't rated higher is game length is long.

Update (Dec 2016): 8.5 => 7.5
The game is still solid but the time investment just doesn't match what you get out of this game. There are plenty of tense moments for both sides and it's fun to talk about the game afterwards but I'd love to get that feeling from a game that's half this length. I still like LfWC quite a bit but I'll happily embrace it's successor when it comes along.

RATING: 9
Amazing game! I think the bare bones deduction is more of a boon to the game than a detraction, and I think there is definitely theme to be found. The first phase of Jack and the police officers distributing woman and officer tokens makes for such a neat head game. It's fun to be crafty and sneaky as jack, and just as fun to be Thinky and deductive as the constables. Asymmetric, but the sides are well balanced ageist each other. SO FUN

Great game! 

The police needs to be able to comunicate and cooperate, otherwise they're in for a hard game.

As Jack, you need to be the meanest and most sneaky player at the table. Getting to your hideout is no good if you get too quickly and there are only so many places you could have gone. Misdirecting the police and making them go on blind chases around the board is extremely 

I think the best player count is 2-3 players, but 5-6 players seems doable IF all the detectives like deduction games and actually discuss their moves. As a player, I feel like I'm contributing even if I'm not actually doing something meaningful with my pawn if I'm helping the whole team by sharing insights and what I think Jack is doing. However, I can understand people getting frustrated if that happens to them, or if Jack is misdirecting them and they can't get to find clues.

Basically this is a spiced up version of Scotland Yard played over four rounds. The thematic implementation of the game with the Ripper murders is pretty good. Each night Jack murders and then has to get back home. Detectives have to deduce where his hideout is so they can set up a perimiter to catch Jack on his way home. After a trial game at Essen it seems that the game favors Jack. But it could also be due to inexperienced detectives. All in all there's too little for me that sets this game apart from Scotland Yard.

A brilliantly tense and simple version of the "hunt the monster" gameplay from Fury of Dracula.  Compared to that other game, this boils away nearly everything but the deduction and the chase.  The result is an incredibly tense game of cat and mouse that still manages to feel drenched in theme.  Our group has had problems caching Jack,though, to the point where our last game was so decisively won in Jack's favor that we stopped playing the game altogether.

The game is initially fun but provides diminishing returns rather quickly (at least it did for me).  Be prepared for boredom if you play with slow or AP-prone players -- the game needs momentum otherwise it becomes rather monotonous, especially as the investigator(s).  When you are hot on Jack's trail, it can be exciting but there is too much grunt work.  Oddly, it is almost worse when a really good player is Jack.  Smart play will yield very few clues so it becomes repetitive:

"I'm looking for clues at 144"
"No"
"Looking for clues at 146"
"No"
(repeat ad nauseum)

The game can be fun (and is usually fun when playing Jack) but, by and large, there are other games I'd rather play.

Too cerebral a game to be somehow entertaining, Letters from Wihitechapel delights in being a cold exercise in deduction and logic: not my cup of tea for sure. Yet there’s some kind of dirty pleasure in trying to find Jack’s tracks and follow them just to discover you were on a dead end.

The hardest among similar games (such as Mister X and Scotland Yard), Letters from Whitechapel is way too long, unthematic and frustrating, thus begging to be followed by a heavy dose of the lightest fillers available to recover.

I adore games with hidden movement and deduction in them.  Fury of Dracula is one of my all time favorites.  Letters from Whitechapel isn't quite as good as FoD...but it comes pretty close.  It's a more basic game, but it is full of theme, atmoshphere, stress and laughter.  This works tremendously well as a 2P game, but will easily support more.  If you're upset that FoD is OOP and you can't get your hands on it, then pick up Letters from Whitechapel.  Personally, I think FFG has no intentions of keeping both of these games in print at the same time.  And for hidden movement fans, LETTERS is a helluva consolation prize.

By far the MOST tense game I have ever played, and for that reason alone it is one of my favourites. My heart is in my throat the whole time I play.

The game is a bit fragile, though. I feel like Jack needs to deliberately not play his best if it's to be a game. Detective players can be left with the feeling that there's nothing they could have done to win.

Always remember this as The first game with my wife(then fiance).

Enjoy this game both ways - either the police or Jack.

I liked analyzing the situation and the possible routes being taken. Jack always need to think twice before moving and the police cannot announce capture at the same location twice. Interesting! 

Playing jack, its like you actually committed the murders and we have to outsmart the police for 4 nights. It might be possible the police had already surrounded your hideout by the 1st or 2nd night. Every game is played with tension .... the adrenaline!

This game is great ! After the first two plays (one on either side) i rate this game an initial 8.5 which is pretty solid. The game is tense and you really have to concentrate all the time on what is going on on the table.

The only concern i have is that the game may be too easy for Jack but i will need to find that out with more plays. Maybe the variant with mass arrestment will fix this issue.

Update: Jack was caught for the first time in our third play. Seems that it is possible for the investigators to find him.

I have a problem with this game, it is super nice, it is intriguing since the beginning but after few moves some people feel boring if they are not playing as Jack the Ripper (the same situation like in "Mysterium" if You are not playing as a ghost). The game is very long if players have problems with decisions. In the police team there can be huge leader syndrome which is not pleasant for the rest of gamers. Playing as Jack the Ripper can be very stressful. Overall it is fun but I don't know do I need this game in my collection.  Definitely this game is full of theme.

Surprised that a lot of people recommend this more as a 2 player game.  It was good as a 2 player game, but it was amazing with more.  The amount of cooperative interaction between the investigators was huge.  Unlike most other coops, everybody had input and ideas of what to do.

Unfortunately the quality of components is terrible.  I have never had a board fall apart, let alone break apart after 5 plays.  The tokens are degrading so quickly that I feel like I have to make my own.  I already made a new board.

Great hidden movement game, but it changes drastically based upon how many investigator players you have. Jack definitely wants the max, as the increased discussion only makes it easier for him to deduce their strategies and slip away, while the 2P variant is almost completely quiet and tense.

They're very different experiences, and I think I prefer higher player counts. It's an interesting situation, though, as the side with the more skilled players is likely to win, regardless of whether it is Jack or the investigators.

Great bluffing and deduction game.  I've seen this criticized for being somewhat themeless and for also being too thematic with the gruesome subject matter.  The truth is really in the middle.

Both sides feel very different to play and the tension of playing Jack is intense and matched by very few (no?) other games.

This game has taken the core bits out of Fury of Dracula and made a very tense and fun game.
The game focus only on the chase and the hunt to find Jack the Ripper.
As this is streamlined to be a chasing game it rise above FoD as that game has a lot of mechanics that can ruin the hunt for Dracula.
In this game it's all about the hunt.
Either you find him, or he manage to escape.

A game that will make your palms sweaty.

One of my favourite games, it feels tense from (usually) night two onwards. There is a genuine sense of accomplishment when you win from either side of the board, and every game I've played has had a post-game dissection, detailing where Jack was at different times and how close the police came to catching him. It's the kind of game that you find yourself thinking about the day after you've played it. Also, there's not too many games where you can say, "And now I'll murder this prostitute," with a straight face.

terrible unbalanced and broked. if you're jack, go and come back for your own track. because you have no answer if you have been there for 2nd time, the escape is easy.

RATING: 10
The three hours of playtime seemed like an hour in the first game. Although it felt tense throughout, it seems the balance tilts slightly in favor of Jack with his extra move options (carriage, lantern) giving him a slight edge. We agreed to play a variant that provides the detective player a needed option of moving detectives over hunting for clues when they seem to be fading from the hunt. I think this will balance things out nicely. Beautiful theme in this cat and mouse classic-to-be, pure deduction and bluffing game. UPDATE: In our second game, investigators win at end of long first night with Jack one move away from his hideout. Jack player chose a long route, which if a little shorter may have worked for him. We did play the variant that detectives can opt to move one more space rather than search in an obviously useless area. Seems to tweak the scales back to a very balanced game, but more plays needed to confirm this. UPDATE: After 7 more games, the last 6 plays have been with no variant and game play was quite balanced and tense for both players. It seems the investigator players(s) needs to be more experienced than or as experienced as the Jack player. Missing one opportunity for a clue can open up an escape for Jack. Contrary to the suggestion in the rule booklet, I think it's better to have the new player play Jack. When the players are even, it is a tense, close game, but the investigators cannot make mistakes. Right now, I would only allow the investigators the additional move option (variant) when that player is inexperienced.

RATING: 10
Sept 10, 2011: The art and theme are extremely evocative. It's a game dripping with theme. It's a bit creepy to play Jack's character as his goals are obviously heinous.

What makes this game shine compared to other cat-and-mouse games (e.g. Scotland Yard) is that it is equally fun to play both roles.

There is a lot of tension playing this game. Though it can take 3 hours to play, the time goes by quickly because the game is so engaging.

Feb 17, 2012 update: 8.5 -> 9.0. After 6 plays, the gameplay is holding up and the games are memorable. We talk about the game afterwards and there is a story to each game. This seems to be the best cat-n-mouse game out there.

We play with 2 variants: detectives get the optional rush movement, and Jack can't kill the same wretched more than once.

Update: we've added a 3rd variant: we start at Roman V and Jack is not allowed home until 1. But after playing a few more games, it feels too stacked against Jack.

Update Sept 2012: 9->9.5 After 16 plays, the game is stilling invigorating. The final "balance" is: include the rush variant, Jack can't kill the same wretched more than once, and on the fourth night, he can't be home on the first move.

Update June 2017: revisited after a few years. Provisionally bumped it to a 10. We can't think of another boardgame that is as mano-a-mano as LfW. It is tense and intense the whole time.

If Puerto rico is the most well-deserved economic game, Letters from Whitechapel is the greatest of the deduction games. My wife's favorite board game. Great theme, perfect edition, all components well done. During play you can actually feel the climate of 19th century London. Each play full of emotions, bluffing, poker faces and risk. If you like all that in board game, LfW is for you. You can play up to 6 players in half-cooperative game, but in my opinion itis best as a 2-player game, when one is Jack the Ripper and second leads all 5 policemen. Top game, i will never ever get rid of it.

Letters from Whitechapel reminded me of Scotland Yard, but it took around 2 hours more… Not cool! 3+ hours is too much for this game, but I still enjoyed myself and would like to try it again. Still, I have a few concerns:

Letters from Whitechapel seems to favor Jack by quite a bit. I’m not saying Jack is going to win every time, not at all, but I’m confident that Jack has the upper hand throughout this game. My only play was with 3 new players against an experienced Jack, and we searched a lot of places except for the right ones in the two first nights… And this is one of my main criticisms; there are just too many options/paths Jack can choose, and it comes down to chance which way the investigators think Jack went; yes, I know, they can try to deduce, and most certainly it will help them, but there are just so many times Jack can move either to spot A, B or C, so you need to take a chance, and you might get lucky or not… This isn’t something I fancy in such a long game! The actual deduction is also limited because of the sheer amount of places Jack can be. And if you think you have a clue about where he is, he can just use a double move or diagonal move and be gone quite easily… We did play with some minor house-rules which make it a little easier for the detectives, but I understand that they are universally accepted, and I wouldn’t ever play without them as the game favors Jack from the beginning. 

So, all in all, because of the length and because the game is heavily skewed in Jack’s favor (this is not just my opinion but seems to be the consensus here on BGG), I cannot rate it more than a 5… I am going to try to get it to the table in August to verify my first-hand impressions, and if I still feel the same, I am probably going to lower my rating by one.

The rules are clear and well presented and the board is very attractive. A small step up in complexity from Scotland Yard though on a darker topic. The cabs and alleyways work very well and fit closely with the theme. Playing Jack the Ripper is more fun but there is something quite satisfying when playing as the detectives and picking up a trail.

Incredibly fun, easy-to-learn, and tense!  It is much more fun to play as Jack, but I've had a blast playing as the police. I'd say this is a nine of playing as Jack, an eight as playing as the police.   

Non-gamers seem to enjoy this game. 

I have a close friends who says he likes his games to be an "experience."  This is the perfect example of such a game: people will be talking about it for half an hour after the game is done!

I will rate this a 9 purely based on my friends. I played this once, and they had all played before and were super into it, using special maps the owner had printed out to make it easier (and more time-consuming) to track Jack's movements. Because they were trying to optimize moves using their maps, their turns were very tedious and my participation was essentially zero. Afterwards, they were baffled at how I didn't enjoy it.... Would like to play again with other newcomers and without the maps, which almost felt like cheating to me.

RATING: 10
This game is awesome. It is everything Fury of Dracula should have been. Trim all the fat from Fury of Dracula and distill it down into just the chase/hunt and you could very well have this game.  The rules are simple and could be played quite easily with people 'outside' the hobby.  The tension and enjoyment-per-time is exceptionally high.  Jack's special moves add a layer of depth and puzzle to the hunt.  The police gaining knowledge of the hideout from day to day makes things even harder on Jack and the tension really does kick up. I can't see anybody who even has a slight interest in deduction games not loving this one.

I played Scotland Yard when I was a kid and really liked it. Letters from Whitechapel strikes me as Scotland Yard for grownups. But that's not to say it's a simple re-theming. Instead, it takes the basic principle of Scotland Yard and adds some very clever mechanics that add tension and theme. Jack and the cops move on separate but overlapping grids. And, Jack gets to play the waiting game each night before he chooses a victim.

It's a shame this game is out of print, because I really have enjoyed my few plays. Most of those have been as a two-player game, and it works surprisingly well with one player as Jack and the other player controlling all the cops. It also streamlines game play because there's no need for the cops to table talk. One play with four players certainly added to the length, but it was also fun to see the cops work it out.

Either way, with two players or more, I can say that this game produces a surprising amount of stress and tension for Jack, which I consider fantastic. I certainly wouldn't pay $80 or $100 for this game, but if you can snag a copy, do it.

2 plays 2 player

After a single night learning game and a two complete games as the police, I like the game but remain hesitant.  It is a fine hide-and-seek style game, good theme fit, but perhaps a bit overwrought with the token related portions of the game.

Right now, it seems very hard for the police to succeed but I look forward to trying again.  The detectives are slow, and it proves difficult to find clues or seal off areas before Jack has an opportunity to get back to his lair.  We will probably only play again with optional rules.

Our 2 player games took about 75 minutes.  I can not imagine playing the game with 4+ players.

We will play again, but the game did not leave me with that "one more game" immediate urge.

One game in and this is quite a lot of fun. There is a lot to consider - as Jack and as the detectives. I believe the game would get considerably better if one took good notes. A good Jack is a delight. I can imagine a bad Jack would make it quite boring. Also, our play was with a fun group of four detectives. There was a lot of cross chatter which probably gave Jack a lot to think about and work with. I can see the two-player being a better 'game' in that there is more focus on the moves as moves. But the multi-player co-operative if super fun and social.

This game provides a good amount of theme in the sense that the hunt to track down Jack the Ripper is pretty tense, but the game just wasn't fun for my group.
I should note that we are not big on co-ops to begin with, and this is essentially a 1 player vs rest of the table co-op.
Also, this game probably would have been better if played with just 2 or 3 players.  When played with 6 players, each  player gets to control only one inspector.  If you get stationed away from the action, you are in for a LOT of downtime.

So far I've played one game as Jack and it was an incredibly intense game from my perspective (arrested on the final turn). I found it an extremely challenging game as a single player against the collective brains of five other gamers. I do think however that the games designers did need to stipulate some time-limits on analysis for the police. Ultimately I think it is a solvable puzzle (more or less so depending on how many clues the investigators find) given enough time to work on it. We allowed the investiogators a couple of minutes after Jack returned home to try work out what had happened. But I think it is certainly a game you can improve upon with experience on both sides of the game. I know I would certainly choose my base differently in a second game and I (and the investigators) learnt a lot about movement subtlties during the game. It was quite interesting showing them where I had actually gone each night after the game. So it's a game well worth repeat plays, just decide before the game how long you want to allow investigators to discuss and analyze stuff during the game. Also I would highly reccomend printing out a better map for Jack to reference for his movement during the game. Look at the board is not an option and the map provided is a bit on the small side. Based on 1 play.

One of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the history of heinous crimes is the horrific series of gruesome murders committed by the infamous Jack the Ripper. This calculating villain wielded a knife with the precision of a scalpel as he stained the streets with the blood of the “Wretched”… London’s ladies of the night.

This board game brings the historical event to life with alarming historical accuracy. It captures everything from the names and visages of the police to the harrowing letters that Jack wrote taunting his would be captors. One player controls Jack, moving in secret, while the other players command the forces of the law.

The game only touched the table once, but in a single play it earned James’ respect as the most fun he’d had playing a board game in recent memory. The game is riveting because the stakes are so high and at any moment the police could catch Jack. Just as easily however, Jack can slip away forever.

People aren't lying when they say it literally gets your heart pumping from stress if you are playing the character that the others are chasing. It's amazing that a boardgame can do that to you. However, after a few plays the effect wears off.

Even without the primal reaction, this is a decent game. If the players doing the chasing are bad at it, it can be boring, because turn after turn nothing important is happening. No clues are being discovered and Jack the Ripper just keeps making his moves in secret.

Scotland Yard with enhancements. 

It feels, at first, that Jack is severely disadvantaged compared to Mr. X in Scotland Yard. Then the night resets and Jack is free to be somewhere else. 

I've only played two times, more are needed to vet the game further.  For game mechanics, I love this game so far. 

The theme is more macabre than I want. I would have been perfectly fine with a murderer somewhere in Europe over a number of nights. It feels a little creepy to be so real to the facts on a sick event. Names of actual victims all over th board?  Picture of the actual detectives? I am slightly surprised there were not legit crime scene pics. Too much. Like it somehow glorifies it.  

Props for having a very thorough, consistent, and connected theme with the mechanics of the game. Bad form for the fact that it's about a serial killer grotesquely mutilating prostitutes in the late 1800's without getting caught. 

Will there be games about Columbine and 911 a hundred years from now?

This game is a great cat and mouse game. One player is Jack the Ripper and tries to outwit Scotland Yard detectives by killing his victims and returning to his lair. The detectives look to find where he went after the kill and mark those spots on the map which narrows down where the Ripper might be. 

Sometimes Jack will double back, or take a carriage, or slip down an alleyway but, if Scotland Yard is up to the task, they can still find Jack before his final kill.

RATING: 8
Played this twice, first time was a blast and we successfully caught Jack on the last night while they were one space away from entering their hideout. Great times were had by all.

Whatever you do, do not let an AP-prone player play as Jack. Nothing is more tedious than waiting 5-10 minutes (not an exaggeration) for them to make a move. Excellent way to kill interest for other players.

RATING: 6
Could possibly be better depending on the group (and people up for a lot of thinking)- I like the hidden movement and finding ways to skirt the police (instead of being super competitive and not allowing some leeway for police to find you)- perhaps Jack should have a VP condition for spaces away from Hideout? Also can out think your opponent in a game of chicken for TWO players. Lowered to 6 because it hasn't been a game that I've really thought about or wanted to play lately. Certainly fits into a niche in a collection but not itching to play again soon.

I have been waiting a long time for the Dutch edition, but is has been worth it; the theme speaks to me and is present throughout the  game; hidden movement / deduction offers me a fabulous tension which is not equalized by other sort of games.

Great chasing game, sort of a cross between Fury of Dracula and Scotland Yard. As of 2012 I believe it's out of print, but if you get a chance to pick up a copy, it's well worth it. Plays well with 2 and 3 players. Tense fun, and maybe the best of its kind.

"Whitechapel Horrors! When will the killer be captured?"
"Her throat was out in a fearful manner. The woman’s body had been completely ripped open and the heart and other organs laying about the place, and portions of the entrails lay round the victim’s neck."

One player is Jack the Ripper, the other player(s) move five investigators through London trying to find a trace of the murderer. When Jack makes it to his home spot (chosen at the start of the game) the night ends. If he succeeds in doing so four times, he wins the game. The other players have to cooperate and try to arrest Jack in order to win the game.

2-6 Jugadors.
És el joc del gat i la rata:
1 Jugador controla en Jack el Destripador.
Els altres controlen la policia (si juga un sol jugador, controla tots els policies).
En Jack mata una víctima i fuig cap a casa seva. La policia l'ha de caçar.
La policia té 4 nits (rondes) per caçar en Jack. Si no el caça en aquest temps, en Jack guanya la partida.
Realment és molt maco el taulell, i tothom en parla molt bé. A mi no em va agradar especialment. Potser pq ens vam repartir els polis entre 4, i hi ha efecte líder. Un 1x1 segur que millora.
És com "hundir la flota" però on els barcos es mouen.

I like that it's a game with a non-fictional theme. The artwork and rule book really add to the theme. I find it fun to play both as Jack or the detectives. I like that the game mechanics are exactly the same with 2P as with more players. Can become a mathematical graph assignment when played by someone who is not so analytical. Best put such a player in a detective team with multiple players.

Sold, because it takes a bit too long for what it is. Could be a great gateway game, but not if it takes a few hours.

A wonderful game of logic and deduction. It can be slow, especially with four or five players (don't recommend five). Interesting with two, but the fun with three (or four) is to simply hear the thoughts expressed by the detectives as they consider the movements of Jack. (Vassal)

For quite some time I was looking for a game with a play style similar to Scotland Yard. I did try Fury of Dracula but with all the cards, special abilities and fights, this was just a little too much for me. When I finally got Letters from Whitechapel (LfW) to the table, I kind of knew that the search was over. Ruleswise, this is a very easy game (right now, I'm able to teach it in about five to ten minutes) that has a all the deduction fun of Scotland Yard.  Although I have not played LfW as Jack yet, it is a keeper for me. I enjoyed every session of it and I find it always fascinating with how little information the police can deduce Jack's hideout and how the tension rises if you can or can't find a clue. Great!

If I had to name something that could turn people off, then it would be a) the play time and b) the fact that you kind of need the right group. 

Let's start with b) first: This game is basically a two player game with one guy controlling the police and chasing the serial killer played by another guy. In order to make it work with more than two players, you do need people that are really paying attention and involved in the game all the time, discussing about certain moves and everything else. Otherwise it is very easy for someone playing on the police side to "go with flow" and do whatever someone tells them to do. I guess, this player won't enjoy the game very much. So I do always try to keep everyone on the police side involved, which isn't too difficult in my gaming group.

Since people playing on the police side should be really discussing their moves, the play time can really go up. We had games that lasted 3.5 hours. Which would be my possible complaint a). But since there's a lot of tension, I don't mind a long play time here.

To sum it up: If you do like deduction, give LfW a try.

RATING: 5
This may be the best game I have ever played. Massively exciting every time.

Edit: Dropped to a 9. As our understanding of the game deepened and our skills as both Jack and the constables increased, the game has gotten really, really long. 

It's still a fantastic game, I just wish it was shorter - or had a short game variant - so it would get to the table more often. But I f you like long games and deduction I couldn't recommend this more highly.

Edit: dropped to an 8. I love asymmetrical games but with more plays the experience of playing each side has diverged too much. The constables work their butts off and still have to rely on getting a couple lucky breaks. Playing Jack is infinitely easier and, once you've picked up a few key moves, almost impossible to lose. And as the Jack player you really need to bring a book to deal with downtime.

I still can't help loving the game but I really hope the upcoming expansion solves some of the problems.

EDIT: This is now the most precipitous ratings drop I've ever made. I'm convinced the game is broken. If Jack plays to win, he can't lose. The game depends entirely on his willingness to taunt the police. If he does not taunt them, he cannot be found.

Very enjoyable hunt/evade deduction game. A simple streamlined rule set and excellent components.

I like.

Update - 3 games now and I haven't seen a 'Jack' win yet - but still lots of fun. If it proves to have longevity I will raise to a 9 - a bit worried it might reveal all of it's charms and secrets in just a handful of plays. Even if this turns out to be true it would still be worth playing every so often. A good purchase.

Update - 9 games of this now and still enjoying it (still haven't seen a 'Jack' win). Rating up to a 9.

For me this is at it's best as a 3-player game - 2 detectives v 1 Jack. The game plays fine with 2, but loses some of the 'fun' when there is no teamwork element and table talk amongst detective players. 4-player, i.e. 3 detectives, might work as long as none of the detectives is too dominant - I would avoid games with 4-5 detectives, some of the detectives will likely be mariginalised.

when I've played this the detectives have always played as a coop team - i.e. there has been agreement on moving all of the pawns - no one has just controlled their own detectives.

I really don't understand the claims of this is too easy for Jack - this is a deduction game, not really a chase game, so get deducting - not finding a clue can tell you as much sometimes as finding a clue, I think some groups are not thinking enough.

One player plays Jack The Ripper, who is attempting to murder the "wretched" and escape home on each of four nights.  The other players play cooperatively as the detectives, trying to prevent Jack from getting home, or even arrest him.  Simple game based on Scotland Yard, where Jack is recording his moves on a notepad, while the detectives and potential victims move across the game board.  Nice ideas, including that Jack and the victims move on a different trail to the detectives.  The mechanics are simple, meaning the players can concentrate on the strategy.  Jack is basically heading home - either via a direct route or using something more circuitous to throw the detectives off.  The detectives are covering swathes of the board, hoping to pick up a clue regarding Jack's movements, or indeed eliminating sections of the board as Jack's potential hideout purely from the absence of any sign of Jack.  The game ends when Jack survives four nights, or the detectives bottle him up before that.  The presentation of the game is rather sanguine, but gorgeous - you could hang the board as art.  A lot to like here.  A superb game pitched between Scotland Yard and Fury of Dracula.

I thoroughly enjoyed my first 2 plays of this game - Once as Jack (2 players) and once as a detective (6 players). At six players, I can see the detectives being susceptible to an alpha player. Not a problem with the game, just something to be aware of. I'm guessing the sweet spot for this game is 3 players, so that the detectives have to discuss strategy out loud, but there aren't so many people that it gets bogged down. Game length can vary dramatically. With the full player count, we got lucky and caught Jack on the second night, but it still took 90 min, so it could have gone a lot longer. I think this game really shines it it's simplicity. The game has relatively few rules, but there are lots of paths to take.

 Ieri in 6 abbiamo provato Letters from Whitechapel nuova edizione, io mi vesto da Jack e uccido in giro per Londra ma vengo braccato e preso in un turno. 
Utilizzare Jack non è facile e saper utilizzare vicoli e carrorre non è scontato. 
Facciamo un'altra partita,tengo duro ma non molto. 
Altra partita e Jack lo facciamo impresonare ad altri,anche in questo caso dura due turni...poi verrà arrestato. 
Bello,avvincente,ben ambientato. Da rigiocare senza meno.

Confermo quanto detto da Andrew,ogni turno sarà soltanto uno a dirigere le indagini quindi abbiamo il classico difetto leader,pero' alla fine la pedina sarai tu a muoverla e quindi farai di testa tua (nel bene o nel male)

RATING: 7
This is probably the best game in the no-frills hidden movement and deduction genre, mechanistically speaking.  I think I would have preferred a lighter or more fantastical theme though.  This may be hypocritical given some other games that I enjoy.  However, I don't like importing "colonists" to farm tobacco in Puerto Rico, and I don't relish murdering women in this one.  Go figure.

That all being said, I love the central conceit that Jack needs to return to a single hideout space each turn.  This gives a wonderful centerpiece for deduction and deceit, and the maps feels very much the map up on the wall of every crime drama.  This game is wonderfully tense and just all around solid and elegant. Perhaps appropriately, this game has murdered Scotland Yard and Nuns on the Run.  Fury of Dracula survives thanks to its delicious chrome, and I suspect a Specter Ops will as well if I ever get a chance to play it. 

UPDATE Sep 2015
I am getting an inkling that Jack can win through a series of fairly cheap moves.  My last game, The  investigators found only a few clues the whole game, and  don' know that I would have done nay better in their shoes.  I pulled a little double back the first nigh, then with that false trail in place was able to get to my hideout fairly quickly on night 3, and in 3 moves (2 wih a carriage) on night 4.  When Jack waits, the women must move, and that can let you reuse a murder spot to your convenience.  So maybe the game can be too easy for Jack, but I won't get to play enough to know, because my wife finds the game frustrating, and I can understand that.

I don't like that the game can be made easier or harder for Jack just by where he chooses to put his hideout.  It makes the app almost a necessity, but then they want another $3 for that.  Not a lot of money if you love the game, but I would wish it was somehow better balanced here. Ultimately this is the point that will probably push the game out of my collection.  Jack needs to consider how hard they want to make the game for themselves at the very start, and that will result in second-guessing whether that was a good choice, win or lose.

If I'm feeling in the mood to outwit somebody than I will snag this game off the shelf. This is a gorgeous game involving Jack the Ripper so, I enjoy the "realism", or at least the real-life reference. One player controls Jack (via hidden movement) as all the others try and determine, through deduction, which way he went - did he backtrack, did he move right past us, where is he!?! Great tension and can be nerve racking for the Jack player.

Perfect game for the wife and I. We both like deduction/hidden movement games, and I've always found Letters from Whitechapel to run best as a two-player experience.

I haven't had the chance to experience Specter Ops yet, but I still feel Letters would win out for me - the unique theme mixed with a complex map, it's hard to resist a game of this one.

RATING: 7.5
I’ve never been a fan of cooperative games, but the one-against-many aspect here adds something that makes it a much more engaging experience.  I found the players much more engaged in this game and emotionally more involved in the decision making than any other cooperative game (the discussions amongst the police/detectives became quite heated!).  In most co-op games, many just sit back and let the alpha-player make all the best moves to defeat the game.  However, here it felt much more real and engaging when Jack announced his move rather than just turning over a randomly shuffled deck of cards to see what plague-cubes were spread to what continents on a map.  

The idea of randomly selecting a lead-detective is also a great away to avoid the alpha player problem and also shows itself as a necessity as here players are much more engaged in this game than I’ve ever seen in any co-op game before.  Here every one seems to care a lot more.  

The only problem I really found was the game’s length.  The box says 120 minutes, but we played this close to 3 ½ hours.  The issue was that the detectives were so emotionally invested in the game that AP started to settle in.  Next time, I would set up a five minute timer for the detectives (especially when played at higher player counts).  It’s no fun for Jack to sit there while the detectives squabble for 15 minutes especially when you have some players drawing out decision-trees and doing probability analysis.  

Oh, and then there is the Rulebook: the mechanics of the game are very simple and streamlined, why can’t the rulebook reflect that?  In its current form, it reads more like a 1st edition Dungeon Master’s Guide!

I've played this game a lot and its comfortably my favorite hidden movement game. Its got book keeping, but man this game makes up for it. This is a really good hidden movement game, far more exicting than Nuns on the Run, and probably better than Fury of Dracula, perhaps to early to call.

2 or 3 players is really where this game is at. With more players, or any player with slight AP it could become way to long. With 2 the police wouldn't have the team discussions that make you feel more like a scotland yard force rather than a single detective.

Choose your players carefully as this is a long game that will turn some players off for that reason alone.  While I found the game quite engaging and enjoyable, there were players at my table more interested in their cell phones than completing the game.

Fantastic game with great mechanics and high potential for tension if played correctly.  If played uncorrectly (e.g. the cops are being extremely stupid and useless), then there's not much to honk your horn at.  However, get the right people together, even in a 1v1, and you have a very fun game of cat and mouse.

Keep in mind that it is normally pretty difficult for the police to win unless a) the Jack player is being really dumb or b) the Jack player is using letters and other boosts.

I think to keep the tension high, Jack should only ever have 1 coach and 1 alley and the cops should always use the rushing variant.

One vs. All, Medium

Solid hidden movement game.  It's easy to teach and isn't that hard to set-up.  Jack seems somewhat over powered, if solid planning he shouldn't lose.  Another issue is the cops don't have a ton of power, and it doesn't feel like a One vs. All game, more like a 1 on 1 game.  I feel like Specter Ops is a better game, LoS mechanic and more abilities given to the Hunters balances things out.  Almost no reason to bring this one out anymore.

RATING: 6
Very thematic game with asymmetric play. I'm not a big fan of 1-vs-many games but this is a good implementation with a lot of tension. 

Couple of things to consider... To me, there's much more tension playing as Jack and given the choice, I would always play as him. Playing as the Police is a shared goal, open information cooperative game, which are not bad, but not my favorite and I would actively avoid playing as the Police, with more than one other player. If the Police aren't able to hone in on Jack's hideout after the first 2 rounds, it can degenerate into guessing and can also last up to 3 hours, which is a bit too long for this type of game.

Quite a bit of constructive feedback, but overall, this is a solid game and I do enjoy playing it as Jack, or with a small team of Police.

RATING: 8
A game that feels different. Not for everyday but always fun when brought to the table. The tension you feel (especially playing as Jack) can be a bit overwhelming sometimes. I have normally played this as a two-player game, but I played also with more people and even if it drags the game a little, it is also a great experience. I think everybody should try to play at least a couple of times at this one.

Go play Scotland Yard instead. This is almost the exact same, but takes way too much time. It's just covered up with a bunch of chrome. This game is "fair" with two. But really, you could just gussy up Scotland Yard and keep the same the good mechanisms from Scotland Yard without all the fiddly rules of Whitechapel.

Oh I love this game, both as Jack and as the police.  I like being able to flexibly add or remove people.  Hidden movement is the best.  Good map/visuals and theme.  Deceptively balanced, and easy to add rule to sway the game in either direction based on the experience level of people playing.

This game is incredible, and was a real hot one for about a year. However, it's a big time investment for what it is, so if I had plenty of time I'd definitely opt for more of this, but sadly haven't played for ages.
Less fun with AP-prone police (my first game, they used a notebook to track me - that was less fun - but they realised his too and stopped).
Mad props to Donald Swanson.

I played this game after I had played Scotland Yard.  While I agree that Scotland yard can be a bit boring at times, I think it is still a quality family game.  This, while not family orientated, is definitely unique, but I feel that it does not give the detectives much of a chance.  Also, you have to play with the right people and this is especially important given that the game will last longer than expected.

[1 play] I think this was a bit disappointing only because I had such high hopes for it.  I played with two new players as the detectives and an experienced Jack.  While the teamwork aspect is fun, it's problematic as well, because the detectives need to work closely together to function efficiently, but how can they plan without revealing all their strategies to Jack?  So this might turn out to be best as a 2-player game.

This game is a gem. More tactical with 2 players but more entertaining for Jack with more, as you can hear the investigators arguing about where you are. Incredible tension and atmosphere. As Jack, you feel like you're often one false step away from getting caught, and as the detectives you often feel like you're just one too many steps behind.

This is the best deduction game I've played so far, hands down. I've been holding out hope for getting Fury of Dracula back out one day, but with this one around, I'm not sure there's reason to. The system for checking clues is clever and creates some good tension and decisions for how the detectives go about picking up the trail. And I like that you don't necessarily have to catch Jack to realize some type of success. Each night gives you new information so you have an idea where he'll be going back to. This tightens the net and heightens the tension.

Have to relate my once-in-a-lifetime session: I won the game on the second turn. Yes, turn 2. I correctly deduced which route my clever friend would take on his first move and found a clue confirming such. Then I correctly deduced that since I was on to his trail, he would move back to the original crime scene so as not to leave another clue marker. It would be the clever move; he's a clever guy. I arrested the crime scene spot and game over, baby. Oh, that can be so satisfying to read one of your friends like that.

RATING: 7
I love, love, love:
- the purity of the hidden movement mechanism
- only occasional twists in the game (carriages and alleyways)
- the theme (anything about the Ripper has always been fascinating)
- the cooperative deduction puzzle, like in the style of detectives
- the sweat of almost being caught or not knowing where Jack is
- the agony of choosing between asking for a clue or arresting
- that the detectives move up to two squares and Jack moves (usually) one circle, so it's not like it's very difficult to catch up to him
- that there is added stuff to change up the game, like the letters, but we still haven't tried them...

I dislike:
- feeling like there's little chance I'm going to win when playing as a detective
- those carriages/alleyways making me feel like there's NO chance of finding Jack
- that the ladies are called "The Wretched"--whyyyy?

Final verdict: Great game that uses the hidden movement mechanism simply but very well with solid theme and plenty of tension with the game always ending in lots of talking about what just happened.

RATING: 9.5
Based on about 30 plays, I am giving this a 9.5.  I have only two other games rated 9 or higher in my collection.  I can't stop thinking about this game.  I wrote a full review but here are the basics:
Wonderfully integrated and executed theme. Finally found something to push Agricola and Le Havre off the table.  Top-notch components.  Fairly well-balanced; Jack has won a little more than half our games, without the optional rules that give him additional help. I disagree with those who say it is imbalanced, although with two players, Jack does seem to win more often. With multiple detectives, it is much tougher for Jack. Replayability factor seems high.  Two negatives: it's a bit long, and a few rules are not clearly articulated in the book.

Very good semi-coop game. 1 against the rest. Find jack the ripper before he reaches his hideout 4 times. Or be jack, and reach your hideout 4 times before the cops catch uo. Super balanced game! play it with maximum 4 players, 1 jack and three players who are the cops. With more players you get a huge downtime, especially if there is one player who wants to decide everything. let everyone take there own decisions, then the game is at his best.

I really did not enjoy this one. Game play is stale and repetitive. Move up to spaces then search, rinse repeat, over and over again. It would have been better if there was some flavour to the police officers, maybe a special ability for each of them so there was some individuallity, especially since they have worked so hard on the flavour in the rest of the game. 

We have annotations on the board regarding the murders, we are given the name and rank of each of the police officers, but no in game flavor there at all? seems a bit strange.

It also feels like both the carriage and the alley way special abilities that Jack gets are very powerful, considering how difficult it is to track him down in the first place anyway.

Its a shame since given the theme this game had such potential. :soblue:

The theme is grim, but I enjoyed the game play and it worked better than I recalled. I managed a win as Jack but mainly as my opponents got bored by the final round and lost interest after 5 count them 5 hours. Technically it works, and feels better than Garibaldi. 

I especially liked the way jack can use the double murder to actually throw the detectives off the track. And conversely how the detectives can start the patrol on the places where they ended. The game is designed to catch Jack gradually, since even having a good idea of his hideout makes it very hard for him to win.

This had been on my wishlist for some time but I had not had an opportunity to play.  I borrowed the game from a friend.

I liked the game, but it likely won't surface to the top of my wishlist.  The tension is palpable in this cat-and-mouse type game.  

I would recommend playing with only two players as I see that it could drag on with more players.

Looks like this could replace Fury of Dracula, to scratch that itch I have occasionally for asymmetric games with hidden movement.

RATING: 8
This game entertains and captivates anyone who enjoys a strategy game.  The first play-through was a bit dry for Jack (myself) and the police (my fiance) were trying to make sure we understood small intricacies of movements and trying to become familiar with the layout of the board game.

The second game, played by Jack (myself) and two friends as the police, was much more intense.  When you take the time to REALLY think through movements and possible locations, this game will really shine.  If you don't like thinking and plotting and being all sneaky - this game is not for you.  If you love these things, GET THIS GAME!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I played it twice and probably won't do it anymore. Maybe I just can't play - for me being a policeman is dull and mentally exhausting since you do the same actions all the time and mostly get nothing. And once you find Ripper's trace, there is so much possibilities due to his bonus skills you actually know nothing more. Sorry, I prefer playing Fury of Dracula, this one is way too minimalistic as for a game of its type.

A very fun and VERY tense game of cat-and-mouse.  If you're the investigator be prepared to feel like you're running around with your pants around your ankles for three hours.  If you're Jack, be prepared to wear a poker face while your guts are being figuratively wrenched out. Serious fun either way.

Successfully hunting down Jack or eluding the investigators as Jack always feels like a great accomplishment and a win is always well-deserved.

This is sort of the master version of Scotland Yard, at least for the detectives. They get fewer, less helpful clues, often move slower than Jack, and generally seem to stand little chance of apprehending the murderer unless they get lucky or manage to piece together a sufficiently clear picture of Jack's hideout over the course of several nights.

So there is the reason why you can't just play one or two nights right there which unfortunately means that the game runs a little longer than it should. Especially if the first nights work poorly for the detectives the remaining murders can drag out much longer than needed.

As is often the case in 1-vs-many games, playing the one, Jack, is the more interesting proposition than the detectives. Playing with more than three players (which would leave at least one player in control of a single detective only) is therefore not advisable. With just two players, I'd rate this at least a full point higher.

The rules make the game seem way more complicated than it actually is. Letters from Whitechapel is a really fun tracking game. A 2-6 players that can be just as fun when played by only 2 players; that is very rare. Increased my vote from 8 to 9 because of this.

I've played both as Jack and the Inspectors and I believe I prefer the latter.

Hidden movement is such a rarely used mechanism and such an interesting one.
As the police officers, I feel as though it is basically a good guess that will cause them to win-- which is terribly unsatisfying-- unless painstaking effort is taken to work out all possible (and reasonable) positions of Jack.

While I can see what fun there is to be had here, I did not enjoy it. I found myself glad the game ended on the second night rather than going for another full hour.

Cat and mouse deduction game. Fantastic art--one of my favorite boards out of all the games I've played--that is both evocative and tastefully (as tasteful as you can make Jack the Ripper) done. I love how tense it can get for both sides. 

Best as a two-player game. The tension for the inspectors will never beat that of Jack's, which can get pretty high and exciting. 

Update: After a few more plays, the novelty wore off a bit. Still enjoy it, though. I like introducing new players to this one and watching them sweat.

excellent mystery game, with pure strategy and deductive elements to it...easily one of my absolute favorites, although its a tough game to introduce to new gamers, due to the AP(analysis paralysis)-if you play as the inspectors- and stress-if you play as Jack- that it produces...the game is rated 10 if you play as Jack, and 8 if you play as the inspectors, so i gave it an average of 9...if you like deductive games, with strategy and with stress till the last night(round), then i definitely suggest it.

I initially rated this as a 5 but after thinking more about the game I decided to drop it to a 4. I am not really a fan of the cat and mouse type of mechanic in general so from the get go the game is rated lower. I found the theme was really not that engaging and was clearly pasted over. There was not a clear ramping up of tension in the game that I think a game like this should have. After almost two hours the game was won after two turns and having two unplayed turns left this made me feel that the game play is way too long and for no good reason. In the end I found the game a bit dull and boring with no real kick to hold me to it.

I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan, and enjoy pretty much anything set in Victorian London.  The theme in this game is so well integrated that I truly feel like I'm on the hunt for Jack the Ripper... or, as is quite often the case, that I *am* Jack.  :P  Every detail of this game is perfect and the quality is excellent.  My only complaint is that my wife doesn't like the game as much as I do.  :)

I've never played a game like this before where I've felt real tension.  Playing as Jack with a smart group of detectives is nerve wracking and exciting.  I once circled around and stood immediately behind a police officer hoping they wouldn't turn around and reinspect the area.  When they turned right and walked down an alley I had to stifle a sigh of relief as I stepped into my hideout and survived another night.

Fantastic game, fantastic mechanics, fantastic theme.  I can't wait to play this game again.

UPDATE:  11 games in and Jack has never won.  We've added the letters to the game from now on and the detectives are not allowed to rush in.  I still love the game, from both sides.  I find it to be a very tense and pure battle of wits.  I've stopped playing this beyond 2p.  It's absolutely PERFECT as a 2p game.

UPDATE: Specter Ops is a similar game with a more family-friendly theme, with more variety in hunter and agent powers, that plays in less time.  LoW is an excellent 2p pure deduction battle of wits, but it tends to drag out from AP.  Specter Ops may replace this, or it may sit alongside this.  We shall see.

Pure suspense.
If you're the person playing the part of Jack The Ripper, you're in for a nail-biting night of close calls as you listen in while your friends discuss their strategies, search for clues to your whereabouts, and tighten the ever collapsing noose around you and your murderous escapades in the foggy London night. You'll be inwardly terrified, but outwardly calm as someone makes a random arrest in the very spot were you were standing only moments before. You'll try on your best poker-faced mask of deception as they question you, suddenly realizing that you've been too careless in picking your targets- too obvious in your choice of escape routes. You may have escaped tonight, but tomorrow, there's more "work" to be done. And they're getting closer to finding your hideout. It's only a matter of time...
If you're playing as one of the investigators, you'll smugly ask the player representing Jack if he fled down a particular alley leading to a squat neighborhood of houses- one of which is his home. You're sure he did, you know you've got him this time, but when he truthfully replies, "Nope, nevah been there, Gov,nah!" your expression curdles. 
You blink at the board as a whole crucial night of police work collapses. You've lost him. 
"No," you whisper, "that's impossible."

But it isn't. Jack is smarter than you thought, because in this game he's being controlled by a real person. A real CUNNING person, who backtracked to the scene of the crime and led you on a merry chase- ducking down dark alleys, and passing within inches of your handlebar mustache. He's slipped through your fingers once again, and tomorrow night another wretched streetwalker will pay for YOUR mistake.

This is an awesome game. You'll play it once as Jack and be instantly hooked on the adrenaline buzz it provides. After that, you'll want to try it as an investigator, because you think you've learned all the tricks.
But you're wrong. You don't know all the tricks, because there's no hunt quite like stalking a real human opponent, and each person will play it different: smart, risky, clever, misleading. 
And sometimes, they just get lucky.

The mark of a good game is how well it creates a simulation of an experience that real life, and/or polite society simply does not permit, and Whitechapel is almost too effective at letting you into the mind of a serial killer. Don't believe me? Let me give you a little insight into the last time I played as Jack:

"There's nothing quite like the thrill of planing my next attack, being hunted, and then dodging their every attempt to contain me. My heart beats in my chest. I have all this nervous energy that I don't know what to do with. It's such a rush! But I have to play it cool when they question me about my movements, because any hint of anxiety, any subtle "tell" that I demonstrate in my body language- they'll pick up on it. Of course, I can use this to my advantage, and misdirect them using the exact same methods. In a way, I begin to feel sorry for them as they fumble about in confusion. I start secretly wishing they would catch me. It's exhausting work keeping up this level of deception. Besides, if they don't catch me, another night will come, and deep down, I know.
I know I'm going to kill again..."

Play this game at night, with candles, and someone who can really act the part of Jack. It will leave your skin crawling, and you''ll pound the table with genuine rage when he gives you the slip. Just make sure you don't get too caught up in the moment. Did the passage above creep you out?
How do you think I feel? I experienced it first hand, and it made me very self-conscious of my actions and behaviors for the rest of the night.
I'm not kidding. 
Be careful my children. When you play on the blood-soaked streets of Whitechapel, someone's very likely to get hurt.

Basicly it's a two player game. Mr. Jack vs. Constable(s). If you play at six players there are 5 players that move one Constable pawn. As in each round there is a leading inspector, there is kind of cooperative "blue moves here and red moves over there etc." No real decisions to take. Just waiting and waiting and waiting. This game turned out to be a Scotland Yard on very light stereoids. It could work as a two player duel but not as big multiplayer game; that was utterly boring, at least to me.  I am not willing to give it second chance as it took way to much time to finish those 4 nights (rounds) with incredible dull and dumb gameplay.

Letters from Whitechapel has a philosophy I was searching for a long time in a game. First of all the board is awesome. It's detailed, with really nice artwork, and also big, making wanna try the game anyways. The way it uses deduction and bluffing is so much clever. The secret movement mechanic is unique giving the game an excellent experience for all the players.

 I have played games both being Jack and the police and you cant imagine how much intense the game was for me both times. Being Jack is maybe the best part. You are listening to the police, you see how they think, you try to confuse them and escape. You are invisible to them, making it easier to take risks and have fun with them like an authentic killer :P.. Being the police also needs concentration and well organizing your movements. You are chasing an invisible killer having nothing but some clues where he had previously been. You must be fast, unpredictable and patient.

I can find a disadvantage in this game (although easily overlapped). First of all it works best only with 2 players and not more. If more people are playing the police, it  is sometimes difficult to take a common decision especially when there is one player who knows the game well (or thinks he knows it) making boring and not fun at all for the rest of the police. Although, if your playing group can find middle ground solutions, so that everyone is happy with the  strategy of the police, and no one tries to establish his opinion and only, this disadvantage is overlapped. Last, I think that if the player who plays Jack is careful, he will always win. Most times though he wont. As I said being Jack makes you a real killer wanting to take risks and confuse the police, and not searching always the easy way to win. But even if this is happening with your group, you can just use the optional rules to help the police to make the game balanced!

In conclusion, I highly recommend this game especially for Jack the ripper and deduction game lovers. It's a unique experience and I'm always looking forward for another game. Have fun!!!

RATING: 8
This game is quite interesting, because it seems hard for Jack to win. If the inspectors can think in a logical manner, they can win handily if they make reasonable assumptions where there are gaps that can't be filled in by logic and one of the inspectors holds back or takes the less-expected route.

The rounds are less about finding Jack on a particular night but more about locating or narrowing the radius for his hideout so that a 4th-night win is all but guaranteed.

I have won as Jack, but it is a very tense experience.

Matt's

Matt is actually way too good at this game, never gets caught, always catches Jack. Game itself seems pretty fun, though I sometimes wish it were shorter. Want to play it a couple more times before passing judgement but I don't think this'll hit the spot for me.

Alright, want to play this on a timer because my main issue is that I just want the game to end faster so I can see if I was right about my guess. Game feels kinda like a permutations math quiz, you run the numbers and end up with a 50/50 guess as to where Jack is. This follows for almost all hidden movement games and I think that's my main issue; interesting interplay and strategy but then it ends up being a guess for the win.

A very good incarnation of the Scotland Yard game, with one player trying to outmaneuver all the others. 

I liked having multiple nights in which Jack must always return to the same hideout. This increases his difficulty every night, while also allowing the detectives more long-term planning.

The board is beautiful, but the rules and reference cards are poorly realized. I also don't like the use of clear plastic markers.

There are only a few games that will cause me to break out in a cold sweat, but this is one of them.  As Jack, running away from the police can be one of the most terrifying but exciting things.  If you like deduction/hidden movement games and the theme appeals to you, this is a must play.

This is a great design that easily suffers from the 'alpha gamer' problem of many co-op game. It can run a bit long and it requires discipline from the investigators to mitigate both problems but it's well-balanced between Jack and the Investigators and there's compelling play on either side. The theme is dark so it may not be appropriate for every sensibility.

Ugh.  What a waste of awesome production values.  Play as Jack proceeds like this:

10 minutes of downtime as the first bobby tries to figure out where you are.  Then:

"Is there a clue at 124?"

"No."

"Is there a clue at 125?"

"No."

"Is there a clue at 126?"

"No."

10 minutes of downtime as the second bobby tries to figure out where you are.  Then:

"Is there a clue at 78?"

"No."

"Is there a clue at 79?"

"No."

"Is there a clue at 80?"

"No."

RATING: 10
I love detective shows and novels, especially stories from 19th century England. So the theme is perfect for me. Really though, the game wins for the thrill of the chase. The first time we played everyone commented about the adrenaline rush you get when the detectives are closing in on you, or vice versa when you know you have the ripper cornered to two or three circles but you don't know exactly which one. You have to have a good strategy as the detectives, but once you figure that out you will always have a few chances to catch him each time.

Update: After 5 plays this is downgraded a bit from 10 to 8. A good Jack is awfully hard to catch which has frustrated a member of my gaming group (of the three of us, he is the only Jack who has been caught). I still think it is a great game. Look forward to seeing how it plays after 5 more rounds. 

Update 2: After 8 plays and 3 house rules this is back to a 10. This game, more than any I have played needs adjustments at first based on the skill of Jack. We have 1 guy who is not that good as Jack and we play the standard rules. 2 of us are fairly cunning and we have implemented a requirement to stack clue tokens if you visit a location multiple times. I used to circle around in similar spots and then break out which was very effective. We also require at least 2 moves from a murder scene before getting home and we have randomized the hideout. With these adjustments I was able to catch the other cunning Jack. We will scale back our house rules once the police winning pct gets to at least 50. The last few plays with these rules have been marvelous and I believe this may be my favorite game at the moment.

Update 3: I am 20 plays in. The other day I caught my buddy 2 out of 3 times using the standard rule set. Playing as the cops successfully is very daunting at first, however over time you develop strategies. As you play more with Jack you begin to anticipate the best moves that Jack may make in a given situation. This game definitely gets better with age, absolutely love it.

I'd really love to rate this one higher. It's a game I really, really wanted to be good but sadly it just isn't. It's so horribly biased in favour of the Jack player that the poor police players can easily end up feeling bored and clueless. Requires a massive amount of house ruling and tweaking just to get close to playable, but considering the play time it's just not worth it I'm afraid.

Fun for the Jack player (sort of), but not for anyone else.

In my experience the only person who truly has fun in this game is the person playing Jack. The rest of the detectives tend to boil down to one person controlling and mapping everything out, if the detectives work together as I assume the game intends they are less successful and make the game 3 times as long. I've played it 4 times and do not plan to play it again.

I gotta say i'm not as enamored as i used to be, the game has one big problem.. that's time. If your Jack the best strategy is to take as much time as possible to reach your hideout. That means you either aim for a 5-6 hour game that you're probably going to win, or a 2-3 hour game that you probably deliberatly going to loose.

The game needs fixing (i'm already using the hard mode for Jack option wise)

_______________________________
Man this is a good one.. i love fury of Dracula so i had high hopes.. and boy.. i love it, but it's pretty different, there are no event-cards or anything. It's the bare cats & mouse mechanic that makes this game so damn good. The hide-out to wich jack has to get every murder-night, the special movement.. the bluffing.. this is going to be one of my favorites! :D

Sort of like Scotland Yard in that one player is the villain and is trying to elude the police.  Better with fewer players I think as that gives Jack more of a chance.

(08/10/2014) Comment based on three consecutive plays.

This is a simple and elegant, GREAT manhunt game, with plenty of cat-and-mouse, skin-of-your-teeth tracking and deduction, brain-melty tension. However, there are strong suspicions that this will not scale well beyond two or three players.

I've played Scotland Yard, Fury of Dracula, Mystery at the Abbey, and Code Name Sector, all earlier manhunt/tracking/mystery games. Code Name Sector is the earliest, where a computer controlled the movement of the submarine--nice, but became quite mechanical after a few plays. Mystery at the Abbey was boring, as it was more of a deduction game closer to Clue than a manhunt tracking game. Fury of Dracula had a good hidden movement implementation, but with attacks and broad playing area, had too much downtime, and very little meaningful play that it was equally boring. Scotland Yard was a good implementation of hidden movement, but lacked the tracking aspect and was too simplistic. So, normally I stay away from deduction, cooperative, and mystery games.

Compared to those earlier games, Letters from Whitechapel is the best manhunt game in a board game implementation (although one of the players mentioned that LfW is comparable to Garibaldi: The Escape--same designer). Play time can vary, depending on the AP of the players, and can be easily compounded with more players, like any cooperative. Playing Jack the Ripper, also, can be an AP nightmare. It is literally a race for five detectives to find clues and try to capture Jack the Ripper before he escapes to the safety of his hideout.

The movement mechanics are simple and intuitive, as well as innovative. The board is the street map of Whitechapel, with 195 numbered circles scattered throughout the board, each connected by dotted lines that represent movement along the streets. Between the circles lie one, two, or three consecutive black squares, usually at intersections or right angles. This means that there are essentially two different movement maps, one with circles where JtR and the "wretched" women wander around, and the one with squares where the detectives travel on. The detectives have the advantage in numbers, but poor mobility as they are constrained to move along the black squares. JtR can move from circle to circle, enjoying comparatively better mobility, especially at intersections. However, he can be slowed to a crawl in neighborhoods off the main road, allowing the detectives to catch up. To balance this, he also has a limited number of one-time use bonus tokens that he can use to achieve faster movement (riding the coach) or flexibility (traveling through alleys).

The game is played in four rounds, where each round JtR kills one (two in the third round) of the "wretched" women that start from fixed positions on the board. From there, JtR secretly plots what number circle(s) he is moving to. Then, the five detectives (each or several manipulated by a player for 1 to 5 players) each openly move on the board along the black squares. They call out the numbered circles they are adjacent to, and if JtR had ever passed through a given numbered circle, they can mark that spot as a "clue". After finding a clue, it becomes an intense game of hide-and-seek, as the detectives try to maneuver to encircle JtR, and JtR tries to outfox and slip out of the closing noose and escape. It is fascinating to watch the chase unfold on the board, as clue markers start to populate the board and show the general whereabouts of the killer.

And just as quickly, JtR can slip by a detective by riding a coach, or lose a tracking detective by moving through alleys to show up unexpectedly on the other side of a given city block and lose his pursuers. However, each round, JtR has fewer and fewer bonus tokens, and the starting locations of his potential victims becomes less and less, thus making it progressively riskier and more difficult for JtR. Fortunately for JtR, the detectives are generally forced to start each round at their present locations, but they have some ability to relocate up to two detectives to default starting locations.

The tension as the JtR player is very high, where he must anticipate where the detectives will move and search, and make his moves accordingly. He has the bonus tokens to shake off his pursuers, but has precious few of them and must use them sparingly and judiciously. The detectives can cooperate and coordinate, but their limited movement can be frustrating. They must also be very careful in searching for clues, as the calling out of numbered circles will end for a given detective, as soon as a clue is discovered, whether it is fresh or several turns old. The tension for the detectives grows equally high as they close-in on JtR, but with higher risk that JtR will slip by/outflank one or several of them. If JtR slips through the cracks, usually there is nothing that the detectives can do to stop him from retreating to his hideout. They will have a clue as to the general neighborhood(s) where JtR's hideout is, and use that in planning for the next round. Of course, if all the clues point to JtR being adjacent to a detective, the detective can attempt to make an arrest. If JtR is indeed at the indicated circle, the game is over and the detectives win. If not, that detective's turn is over.

This game was so enjoyable that with three players, we played the game three times consecutively, with each of us playing JtR. There are no random elements or game mechanisms that get in the way. This is purely a chess match and poker game rolled into one, with mind against mind(s). The euphoria in capturing JtR is a great gamer's high. The euphoria in eluding capture as JtR is even a greater high. Although playing a full four-turn game clocked in at about 2.5 hours, the payoff is immense. Both hunter and the hunted will find an extremely pleasurable gaming experience, if they are into tracking and evasion. It taps the primordial Id and ego, as both sides brazenly think they can outwit the other. As Jack, it is easy to shift into megalomania, taunting and tempting the detectives; he secretly wants to be caught, but feels sorry as he watches the bumbling detectives flail blindly. He wants a challenge, so he may take undue risks and go right up to a detective, get "detected" and then get an adrenaline rush by quickly evading, while simultaneously stroking his ego by confirming his intellectual superiority. As far as theme, this game drips with it, but we can easily see a number of equally exciting re-themes: sub versus destroyer(s)--think Enemy Below or Balance of Terror in Star Trek:TOS, classic fox and hound scenarios, or the movie Alien--think crew members try to track an alien on board a space ship, but the alien may kill you.

The "Alpha Male" syndrome that plagues most cooperative games is somewhat addressed with one of the detectives randomly designated "The Boss" each round. The sweet spot may be two or three players at most--the two non-JtR players can control two or three detectives (we played two apiece and shared one between us, as well as rotating the "boss" title, instead of the random draw) each for more flexibility and fun. If this gets to six players, it will be one detective per player, and the range of options will be far less interesting--there is risk that one of the detectives (every round) will be so far out of position, as to not being able to contribute meaningfully. We will have to play at larger numbers and see, but I suspect controlling only one detective may become boring very quickly--the game looks like it will not scale well with more players. This is a solid "8", with room to move up, but for only 2 or 3 players so far. With 5-6 players, players may suffer the same issues that plague other cooperatives: little meaningful play, alpha male, and long play times.

A really stressful game, either you play the side of the cops or the Ripper. I really enjoy the excitement and the atmosphere this game generates. It's more fun. i believe, when there are three or more people playing, because of the interaction and the strategies that are built by the co-op between the cops.

Very nice deduction game!! A bit heavy for certain situations and some players might get frustrated when they can't guess, more or less, what Jack is doing. Probably a bit long for most casual players but very rewarding, in my opinion, when you just realize what could've been happening and you guess right. Detectives have to be very focused and stay cool. Most of the times they are going to think they are completely lost when the Jack player is feeling the pressure of being traced quite close. As the Jack player don't get overconfident! A detective's gut feeling might put you in jail!

Hide n seek on a table. Great game, I like it better than Fury of Dracula, since it`s much simpler and shorter game, but it`s got that tension what makes Fury of Dracula a good game.

Important! I don`t care what people are saying, but this game is best NOT with 2, but with 6! With 2 it`s just slightly boring, very minimal table talk, just a silent hunt, but with 6 it`s going to be a good party type game. It`s really fun to see - as playing Jack - how the detectives are arguing about the clues and such, and playing as a detective it`s an interesting coop game, where players truly need to work as a team.

Got it yesterday, Thursday the 18th, August 2011.
Had 2 plays so far and by far this is my favorite game so far. I love this game! simple mechanics and flow, but what mood it sets, what gameplay and the feel of it. I've done some research and gotten addicted to the facts surrounding "Jack the Ripper" Case. This game is so historically accurate and it encompasses it so well into the game. Best themed game I've ever played. As for the Deduction & Bluff style of game, this game is far better than Scotland Yard, and it doesn't bog down the gameplay like Fury of Dragula does with all the cards & combat. My first ever 10, and it's well deserved. A must game for any true boardgame collector & fan of mystery and deduction style of games.
I look farward to playing this game more & more!

The detectives never won in my group. Jack just backtracks, uses his special powers and gone he is. This is frustrating and makes getting in on the table more and more difficult. I would only play this with 2 or 3 players.

Otherwise it looks like Scotland Yard done right. Maybe it just looks that way??

Its really a 2 player game that you can kinda break up into more players by making them all policeman. The really fun thing about this game is when your playing jack, trying not to freak out when the police are hot on your trail. Its a little dark being jack and killing prostitutes, but thats the fun of the game.

RATING: 7
When playing with 2 or 3 players this is a great game, with 4 it's good, with 5 or 6 it's not enjoyable. I've only played as Jack so far and I like how with more players you can find your way out because you hear what the detectives are thinking and planning to do because they co-operate and talk. as a two player game this is way more tense, the opponent won't tell you what he/she is thinking and it becomes a way heavier game (IMHO), it's brainburning at times and you feel like you're being chased and the theme is just dripping of this game. It's a great gaming experience, my reason for rating it 'only' a 7 is because I would not reccomend it at higher player counts.

Neutral - on occasion.

I never play [thing=438][/thing], so this kind of games pretty fresh and intriguing for me. I found that the "arrest" action discovers much less than "find clues", police tend not to use it. As a counter-strategy. jack side can just move around a few dots(maybe only 2 to 3) to confuse the police since the probability of direct arrest is pretty small.

It's pretty good as a party game. I will be great if it's even more strategic than it appears. I need few more plays to confirm how strategic it is.

Ugh. Deduction game. Bleh.

--- May 5, 2012 ---

I have now played a second game of Whitechapel. Honestly, I didn't expect to ever play it again, but I had a group over who were keen to give it a go. I enjoy playing pretty much any game with good company, so I was happy to give it another shot. I can't say I like the game still, but a better second experience bumps the rating from a 2 to a 4.

My rating of 4 assumes I'm playing as an investigator with at least a few other players. I like being a part of the investigation and watching the story unfold. I don't like being the sole person who has to be able to figure out and picture where everything and everybody has been, including a phantom Jack that I can't even see. The aforementioned story really is fascinating, though. The mechanics and flavor work _very_ nicely in tandem.

In all honesty, I feel bad giving the game even as low as a 4. The game itself is very well made. The components are beautiful, and the gameplay is tight. It's just not my style of game. In the end, I really feel that I should rate games based on how I feel about playing them rather than how much I respect the design.

Letters from Whitechapel is in the same game family as Scotland Yard and Fury of Dracula.  One player - constantly moving around the board (subject to restrictions and objectives that he has to meet) trying to evade a team of all of other players.

This game is incredibly fun. Simple, tense, strategic, lots of player interaction. Just a great implementation of a deduction game. It has a wonderfully designed board, well-written rulebook, and elegant components. The theme just drips right out of the box. 

Games can last a while, but they never drag due to there never being any downtime for either the investigators or Jack. I love how the two sides offer completely different experiences. The investigator side plays like a wonderful co-op mystery game, rewarding deduction and reasoning, but also encouraging strategic area control tactics, while Jack plays like a deliriously tense game of hide and seek: requiring good bluffing skills, creativity, and being cool under pressure. An awesome experience on both ends. 

I personally love this game, but it has been hard to get other people to come back to it. The game is quite long, and strategy a bit difficult to comprehend at times. I still consider this a "will always play" game for myself, so despite these misgivings, I still rate it a 10.

A hidden movement game based on the mechanic of SCOTLAND YARD and based on the historical murders of Jack the Ripper. Thrilling and tense, but its one real downfall is that if teh trail goes cold, it can be very dull and boring for the police officers. I recommend using the optional rules in the back of teh book to give the cops more options, and Jack a few more tricks up his sleeve. If you buy into the story, its a bloody good time.

An excellent deduction game where a group of investigators try to track down Jack the Ripper across a period accurate map of London. We've really enjoyed the back and forth of the chase and trying to narrow down where the Ripper might have gone or where he is headed. It works just as well with two players as with a larger group.

RATING: 8
Personally, I'd rate this one as a 9 on its own merits. It can drag a little in the mid-game, but the final act can be incredibly tense if both players are on the ball (assuming 2-player here).

However, the length and involvement keep it from hitting the table except very infrequently, and my wife doesn't want to play it very much (especially now with other games she loves), so it drops a couple points.

Fantastic hide and go seek deduction game based on Jack the Ripper. Catch him before the time runs out. Tough to win ... unless you're Jack. Good with 2 ... but better as a cooperative game with everyone trying to trap Jack. Getting tough to find but apparently there is a reprint coming with some new touches. TOP#15

Now having played a few times, that this would be better as a 3 - 4 player game rather that a group co-operative. May be a reasonable 2 player game too.

Enjoy every play so far, even as Jack, although I could not get home - damn rozzers blocked my path either side of my lair on the last turn - great guesswork.

Theme: Murdering Prostitutes in Victorian Era
Gameplay: This is a pretty great hidden movement that's so enjoyable you'll frequently forget that it's about Murdering Prostitutes in Victorian Era.
Components:  Outstandingly macabre board & components.
Replayability: Everybody is going to want a chance to play Jack, and murder prostitutes.
Rulebook: Could be a little more clear.

RATING: 8
After three games, the game is holding up well. I have only ever played Jack (two defeats, one victory), and find it a hard job against thoughtful detective play. Against policemen playing more on instincts, the game becomes easier as Jack. In our games, more policemen = more brains available for deduction, and a correspondingly harder job for Jack.
---------------
Very nice initial impression. I tried the game with three players, with me playing Jack against two detectives. Quite a lot of dowtime, but never a dull moment listening to the detectives narrowing down the possibilities, with me trying to look unconcerned when they were getting close. :)

On the whole, a great game! I think I prefer it with more than two players, since this allows for the whole coop deduction part of the game to come to its right.

RATING: 9
Fun hidden movement game. I REALLY enjoy that the player count is actually arbitrary. We had 1 Jack, and 7-8 Detectives collaborating when we played a number of games over New Years weekend with the family.

There is quite a bit of strategy involved, but sometimes it's simple luck whether the detectives did X before or after Y. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a very tense and intricate game.  With 2 players and somebody playing quickly as the detectives you can do a game in 75 mins or less.  With many players and a lot of deliberation/coordination, you can spend more than the listed 120 minutes on the first night alone.  It's been hard for us to find a sweet spot where the game seems balanced.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2011)

This is an ok thematic game, still I feel it is too long for what it offers. Perhaps this is played best with 2 players, I have played with 5 players both times and the downtime is considerable (and unacceptable). I enjoy playing this at the beginning, however I feel the game get samey very quickly and it begins to drag so I’m downgrading it to a more fitting rating. If only the game didn’t ran for 4 nights :(. I feel that Jack can have more fun that the investigators.

The game is fairly simple to teach, but the play time exceeds the 3 hour mark and that is a big negative for me, also the game can be broken easily if the Jack player makes a mistake.

In my experience, the Jack player has a hard time avoiding the investigators, so I would advocate to always play with the optional cards.

The component´s quality is pretty good.

Bottom line, a decent game, one that I have no desire to own or play too often, perhaps once a year is ok for me.

After another play, I had much more fun this time. Also it seems I have been playing it with some rules mistakes (I never read the rules). I’m upgrading its rating. My problem with the game is the downtime, with fast players I enjoy Letters from Whitechapel a lot.

I will play again to see if the rating continues to rise.

Just played a 2p game as the detectives and was completely stiffed by Chris due to his good play and my inability to see past some incorrect assunmptions I'd made. I'm thinking that having a small detective team may give the best experience, as there the opportunity to challenge anyone who makes unsound assumptions while avoiding the ruckus and risk of strong personalities shouting down the quiter ones that can come with a large detective team.

Still a very enjoyable game though.
______
Nicely produced asymmetrical catch the hidden escapee game in the same genre as Garibaldi and (the Daddy) Scotland Yard.

In effect there are 4 escapes (rather than the single escape in Garibaldi/SY) which adds interest and variety, as does Jack choosing a different hideout (the space to which he escapes) each game. 

Jack must think ahead to which of his victims he wants to take in which location on each of the escapes, and try to lure the detectives away from his hideout as the detectives carry most of their positions forward from the end of one escape to the start of the next. (Identifying the rough location of Jack's hideout and clustering 'tecs around it seems an obvious strategy for the detectives).

Get past the dubious theme and it's a good game, Like most of these games I suspect it's at its best in pure game terms as a 2 player game, but it's good social fun as multiplayer game. Again like most games with a co-operative element the detectives have to work in unison which can be a challenge. I suspect like most co-op games it could suffer if one detective tries to take over the decision making (the game rotates the lead detective from escape to escape to try to avoid this), which would turn it into a 2-player game with some frustrated observers. (This hasn't happened in my plays to date but I could see it if there is a domineering player in the detective team).

I love this game.  The mechanics are elegant and are integrated with the theme so well.  I have played both as Jack and as the cops.  Both sides were fun.  My prediction is that this game is timeless and will be one that I still want to play 10 years from now.

Update Aug 2012: I like it, but lowered the rating by one because there just isn't enough for the cops to do.  It works better as a 3 player game than a 5 player game.  I also think that playing Jack is a lot more fun than playing the cops.

RATING: 7.8
Game was a lot of fun and easy to learn.  Game art, board and pieces are really nice.  I like the historical theme even though it is a little sensitive.  In my opinion, there is a small flaw in the escape mechanics.  It is too easy to know Jack's whereabouts once the scent on the trail is picked up.  The game becomes a lot harder for Jack to win, the more players and formidable minds there are to play against.  Probably best to keep it at one to two players, but it also adds to the challenge.   Overall, I would play it many times though.  Who doesn't like cat and mouse gaming.

RATING: 8.8
This is a cleaver game. One player is hidden from the other players and all the information you start with is where he starts (killed). the hidden player (jack the ripper) must then make it back to his hideout. a place chosen by him at the begging of the game. he must do this three times (3 rounds) to win the game. everyone else is detectives on the board trying to capture jack. this is done by trying to find where jack has been as apposed to actually nailing down his exact position. the first two round are spent trying to workout where jacks hideout is and the third is spent trying to prevent him from reaching it and if possible capturing him.
jack and the detectives use different dots on the board to move so the detectives can never be on the same space as jack (the spaces next to the detectives can be investigated).
i love this game!! in one game the detectives managed to catch my rout (as jack must revel where he has been). but started to follow it unbeknown in the wrong direction back to the crime scene allowing me  to make my getaway that round. this game can make you sweat as you listen to the detectives talk and deduce... often giving you the impression they are in your head and know everything!!!

I really enjoy this hidden movement game. It plays very differently from Scotland Yard, which, while fun, can drag a bit. The pre-kill bluffing/planning phases add a nice element to the gameplay, and the multiple night phases allow for some really interesting strategy (spend a couple of nights finding the trail, then extrapolate and start trying to catch Jack). The game rules come with balancing variants that can handicap both Jack and the Police and make it easy to balance for various player strengths.

Trata-se de um jogo de análise. Ainda só joguei uma vez pelo que não vou estender-me muito na avaliação. No entanto parece-me bastante prometedor. Tem todos os ingredientes de um hit. Se tivesse que apontar algo, diria que o facto de ser um contra todos os outros não é assim tão apelativo, pelo menos para mim. E quanto mais quando do lado dos outros tanto faz estar uma só pessoa como cinco: a dificuldade é igual para o Jack. Jogado somente a dois, parece-me a melhor opção. Ainda assim um bom jogo que me relembra o velhinho "Scotland Yard" ainda que só em alguns pontos.

Real fun, tense deduction game. Can run a bit long. Great two player game, with more I would imagine it running longer with all of the deductive chit chat. Takes Scotland Yard as a base and creates two movement tracks, one for police and one for Jack, which both move at different rates through different parts of town. Very dynamic as your plan must constantly adjust to what happens on the board. The score on this could rise as game length gets more efficient!

Ok game, a bit more involved than Scotland yard because there is more strategy involved than just "converging" and blocking off where Jack might be (especially in early nights).

It seems to be better as a 2 players game due to long length...

edit: avoid with full house, simply not worth the time investment.
edit2: thematically, some rules don't make sense. "Waiting for the kill" gives you more time to escape? You can kill the same girl 3 times? Police can't continue investigating in the night after Jack went home? Head of investigation changes every night? (What kind of police is that?)

RATING: 6
Whitechapel is a spiced up longer and more challenging Scotland Yard. At least as far as I can remember as I haven't played Scotland Yard for more than 20 years. Jack is out for four nights where he repeatedly has to escape to his hideout after his ugly deeds. While it is more difficult for detectives to locate and chase him than in its predecessor, information about his hideout is carried forward each night allowing them to draw the net closer around Jack. With AP prone groups Whitechapel can seriously drag. Four nights will be too long in that case. But in the right constellation, and especially for the Jack player it's a thematic and gripping experience. Contrary to the majority opinion, I prefer three players to only two players as listening to the investigators' discussions is a big part of Jack's fun in the game.

Reminder: Play that no Wretched can be killed twice even if she moved from the starting spot and got killed on another spot which - according to the rule - still would allow to use this starting spot in the next nights.

I have a hard time deciding which side I like playing on better.  Jack the Ripper is insanely intense and stressful, but Scotland Yard can be mind numbingly frustrating!

I love just about everything about this game; the theming, the artwork, the stress it puts on you...it's all just very well done. It's very well balanced so as not to make Scotland Yard or Jack too OP for the other, but waiting around as Jack can be kind of boring considering you can plan your moves ahead of time and have them taken out immediately.  Listening to the constables  plot out their turn can be beneficial, but at some points you'd just like to get the game moving.

I feel like when playing as Jack, you're more acting as a device for the other players instead of truly playing against them - but that could just be from my own experience.

A solid cat & mouse, logical deduction game. It is kind of hard to learn if you're not familiar with FFG, especially with their overly complicated rule book (A lot of different phrases, turn order, special turn rounds etr...). However, once you get the hang of it, it become like battleship level simplicity. 

Furthermore, the game is essientally a 1-vs-1 game in disguise for being playable for 2-6 players. Unless your group are planning to listing down a spread sheet of each possible routes, the game honestly doesn't provide that much interesting discussion for more than 2 players.

Our family got this one up and running fairly quickly.  If you've played Scotland Yard you're a step ahead already.  
There is a grittiness and harsh reality to the game due to the subject matter and how well it works in the theme.  It could be played with younger kids, but parental guidance is advised.

After playing the "Jack" role, I think this game requires two separate ratings.  It is a completely different game when you are Jack.  Better.  If you're playing Jack its a 9.

This game is, for me, all that is best about Fury of Dracula with none of the annoying dross. It's got a very clean mechanic and is equally good playing as Jack or as the police. I've only played at 2 and tbh don't really want to play at more than that number. Unlike most games that involve a random element, this game is purely pitting one player's intellect against the other's. Assuming I've got the time to play, it's exceedingly rare that I'd turn down a game. Very elegant, beautiful components and artwork. I wouldn't be without it in our collection.

The game wears its theme lightly. The ghastly murders are off-stage, and the game is all about the hunt for the killer. The rules are well written and illustrated, easy to grasp and to remember, so the players are free to concentrate on the game rather than the mechanics. The board is complex and the possible routes that Jack could take are so varied that each game is different from any other. The atmosphere of the game is terrific - on the one hand the confusion and frustration of the police, and on the other the tension and the close calls as the noose closes.

The components - the beautifully designed board, the chunky pawns and the subtle counters are exactly to purpose.

The game is hugely entertaining. The police are in constant discussion and speculation, while Jack sits quietly, listening and hoping that the deductions lead to exactly this move, and above all not that one. Jack’s moves are typically quite fast, but one weakness of the game is that the police may take forever to move - an egg timer may come in handy. A second slight shortcoming is that it is really important that Jack doesn’t give a clue to his whereabouts by gazing at the bits of the board that interest him most. A third is that it’s a long game, taking perhaps 3 hours - though the game is exciting enough that people are prepared to risk missing their bus home…

One important piece of process for Jack: it’s worth having a short printed checklist for Jack’s coach moves: (1) note down both circles, in order, on the move track; (2) place the coach token on the time track and move the Jack pawn to the far end of the token. (It is only too easy to forget to mark both circles on the move track, and this can be crucial if Jack later claims not to have been in a circle because it wasn’t noted on the pad.)

Two important remarks:

(1) “Adjacent” has slightly different meanings that are crucial to the game - in particular, the balance is thrown entirely off if “adjacent” is misunderstood in the context of search and arrest.
Jack’s move: a circle is adjacent to another if it is joined to another by a dotted line that does not pass through another circle. Even though three intersections lie between them, 26 and 79 are adjacent for Jack.
Wretched move: as for Jack.
Wretched end of move: the Wretched may not end its move adjacent to a Police Patrol token. The Wretched may move from 27 to 44 if there is a police patrol at the square closest to 79, but not if there is one at the square between 44 and 46.
Police patrol look for clues or arrest: in a circle joined to their present position by a dotted line that does not go through a square. Police at the square immediately north of 79 may search in 79 but not in 44, 46 or 27.

(2) Most dotted lines meet at squares, but some intersections are clearly offset from a square, such as 44-26 and 65-83. there are also 6 intersections are more subtly offset. Thus there is only a single square between 45 and 46, and between 46 and 47. Similar offset crossings link 44-59, 30-50, 53-68, and 139-164, and there are two squares between 175 and 188 in either direction.

Two important house rules to balance the game: 
(1) The location of Jack’s hideout is chosen at random, either using an app on a mobile phone or by reference to specially-prepared random number tables. 
(2) Time starts at Roman V and Jack may not declare he is home before time reaches Arabic 1.

I had this game on my radar before BGG Con 2014 but didn't know what to expect when we snagged a copy from the library.  During the explanation my eyes were glazing over, it seemed over complicated and convoluted... nothing could be further from the truth.  Once we started I began to see how really simple and brilliant this deduction game is, it's cat and mouse like I've never seen in a board game before.  We played first with all new players and a very generous teacher and later with a mix of new and experienced players and had a blast both times.  Everyone was engaged and working together with Jack the ripper weaving in and out of our dragnet.

So happy this got a reprint shortly after the con, it was an insta-purchase for me.

Even if it is purely logic game the theme is very strong and perfectly matches the games mechanism. Great thematic euro game!

Comment after 19 (edit: new games added) games, out of which 13 were 2-players games and 6 were 4-players games.
Most of 2-players games (10 out of 13) ended up with Jack victory while none of 4 players games was successful for Jack. There were only two players in control of Jack equally sharing across the games. Seems that this is a psychological phenomena. While single inspector tends to lock into wrong paths, many inspectors, even if having disadvantage of discussing their plans in front of Jack, are able to think of more possibilities and are able to double check the deductions.

Excellent game. However, be aware the rules are very much in Jack's favor. He gets to go first every round, AND he gets to decide when the round ends--in other words, not every player gets an equal turn on the last round of the night. You can house rule this to be a bit more fair, but still. Also, this game is only as good as the ability of your detectives to work together.

Really enjoyable first game. Very nicely done deduction system, how it will stand up I'm not sure but well worth a try.

With 6 players it seemed very hard for 'the ripper' and we caught him on the second night. but still..

Looooong if it goes the full 4 nights. Maybe too long a game for what it is... Want to try it with 2 or 3 players as it could be a lot faster and more involving...

Much quicker with 2 but not as 'fun'. I can imagine 3 (or, maybe, 4) being the best.

The board game Letters from Whitechapel, which plays in 90-150 minutes, takes the players right there. One player plays Jack the Ripper, and his goal is to take five victims before being caught. The other players are police detectives who must cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game. The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines. During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel's streets. Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles.

RATING: 7.5
After one play, which I won as Jack, I am eager to play this game again. I was close to being caught several times but managed to slip away through pure luck or the investigators convincing one another to make different moves. There was some confusion among the investigators as to what had happened during earlier turns in the game ("We're sure Jack was at this spot during Night 1 and he moved normal, normal, carriage, alley, home, so his hideout is in this range" "No wait, wasn't it one normal then alley then carriage?" "Where even were the police during that night?") So some system of notekeeping for the investigators seems like it would cause less confusion and make for a quicker game, but then again maybe it would then be too difficult for Jack to win.

Edit 2/19/13: Having now played 4 times, twice as Jack and twice as an investigator, I feel like I now have a pretty good handle on this game. In my opinion, it is much easier to play as Jack, as he has perfect information (can see exactly where the police are, and in a lot of cases hear what they are planning as they discuss their strategy with one another). Both of my plays as Jack resulted in victories for me. My first play as an investigator was also a victory- that is, we caught Jack before the end of the 4th night. In that instance, I felt like our capturing Jack was due to luck more than skill. It felt like there was a lot of "well...maybe he went this way, I don't know, I guess we can try, oh hey look we were right."

My second play as an investigator was both aggravating and confusing. Although I was keeping notes, which I thought would help even the odds for the investigators, I spent much of the time just staring at the board and having no idea. The investigators ended up narrowing down Jack's hideout to one of about 4 or 5 potential spots in a small area, but we were never able to determine with certainty where he was going. In the end, the game had devolved into the investigators just checking the exact same spots over and over while Jack durdled around, and we decided to say "we think we have your hideout surrounded and we aren't moving for the rest of the 4th night. If you can't get home, we win, otherwise you win." It turned out we were off by one space and Jack was able to get home. This particular game lasted over seven hours, which certainly contributed to the general feeling of tediousness and frustration we felt at the end. Previous plays lasted about 3 to 4 hours.

I have yet to play as a 2-player game, which seems interesting for the investigators, or with any of the advanced rules, which are designed to either help Jack with one set of rules, or help the investigators with the other set.

If you are going to play this game, I recommend that you commit to play fast, at least on the investigators side, because it is very easy to get bogged down in trying to exactly determine Jack's whereabouts and remember all your information. Playing quickly means it is still possible to narrow down the location of Jack's hideout, and means you only have to spend the latest portion of the game truly puzzling out exact clues.

co-op battleship. why on earth do people like this game?

Game is entirely luck and search-pattern optimization when you're the cops (a dry, solvable puzzle if you want to spin your wheels parsing the numbers and patterns). Maybe it's more fun for jack? Was miserable, went to go take a dump and asked the other players to take my turns for me - which didn't matter since you could have 1 player moving all the cops or 7 and the outcome is still the same. Co-op games without traitor mechanic always lead to the experienced player telling everyone what to do anyways - or watching people make sub-optimal plays.

A brilliant game that pits two different types of tension together (for Jack and the Police). Played well both players will feel the pinch of the other player, and can quickly go from elation to desperation, and vice-versa.

For me it works best as a two player game, but it also works well as a social game for more players -  especially more casual gamers - which is a nice bonus.

I play with the investigators getting a one off 'house arrest' to pick Jack's hideout, as otherwise Jack can play some broken strategies against an unsuspecting police player.

Letters from Whitechapel is a great game but it's not for everyone. In this hidden movement deduction game one player is playing Jack the Ripper. Every round Jack kills either one or two victims and then stealthily tries to get back to his hideout before the constables have him cornered or arrested. The other players (1 to 5) control the five constables who are out to catch him. As in most hidden movement games, one player's moves are hidden. He doesn't move a pawn on the board, but writes his or her movements down on a special notecard. The constables need to find them by moving their pieces on the board and investigating locations to pick up his trail.

I played this game after first having played Specter Ops, a game I absolutely love. But since I now own both and they're both hidden movement games I can't help but compare the two. 

I love Specter Ops but haven't played it as a four or five player game. The game scales differently with different player numbers and it can get problematic with a four or five player game. Also many of the rules aren't very clear. As a two or three player game it is magnificent however. 

Letters from Whitechapel plays equally well with all player counts. Regardless of the number of players, the game is always played with 5 constables versus Jack. In a 6 player game, one controls Jack, the other five players control one constable each. In a two player game, one player is Jack and the other player controls five constables. In a three to five player game some players control more than one constable. This balances the game far better.

My main gripe with Letters from Whitechapel is the playing time. I do enjoy long games if there's a lot to do and think about it. But Letters can take up to two or three hours and depending on AP prone players even longer. If you're playing with four, five or six players this can mean lengthy discussions and a lot of waiting time for the player who controls Jack. Also the game can suffer from boardgame dictators who'll overrule the opinions of less assertive players. 

A single game can suffer from less eventuful stretches where the constables have completely lost Jack for multiple turns. But the game can turn on a dime and suddenly become extremely tense and exciting. And when the game hits on all cillinders, it can be one of the most memorable boardgame experiences you'll ever have. 

But the game has proven devisive in my player groups. Some players love the deduction element, others absolutely do not. Make sure players know what they're getting into when you get started. 

Sold in december '17. Just too long. I prefer Specter Ops over this.

A good take on the Scotland Yard type of deductive reasoning game. A theme that was begging for a Scotalnd Yard type game, and this one does it rather well. I do wish that the game had a few more thematic elements. It takes a talented Jack player to be able to avoid the other players. One of the most brillant parts of the game is how each side moves across the board, with Jack moving on one track, and the investigators moving on another.

This 1 vs all deduction game has rather simple mechanics that I think would make it very accessible yet allows for some clever bluffing. The different dot system for Jack's and the cops movement is something I haven't seen before. The thing is even if the player controlling Jack the Ripper has a clear path to their hideout, they don't necessarily want to just make a beeline towards there, as if a detective catches wind of the general location they are heading that can expose Jack's hideout in future turns. Instead, double backing to give false positives on the direction Jack is traveling seems to be key, although the Jack player must also not dawdle so long that they run out of time or allow the cops to find the actual path he took. 

I like the secret unit deployment in this game, as it makes sense that the cops would have a sense of where Jack would struck but not exactly where, and vice-versa. However, I find it strange that Jack has more time to escape the longer he dawdles.

Yet another variant to Scotland Yard.  Unlike something like Fury of Dracula, Letters from Whitechapel requires constant tactical teamwork, often to no end.  The game can be frustrating (and therefore tedious) for several turns, especially if certain variants in the rule book aren't used.  However, as a 1v1 game, Letters turns into a much more tense battle.  An interesting balance of theme and mechanics which is generally a little lighter on theme.  The end game seems to favor Jack a little much, while the beginning seems like working in the dark for the hunters.  Odd.

This game is INTENSE.  I love playing on both sides and feel the pressure either way.  It can sometimes feel a little 'samey' if played with the same crew, so I like introducing this one to new groups.  An excellent deduction/hidden movement game.

We had a great time with this game. We were screaming and laughing constantly. It was more due to the group I think more than the game itself though. Still This is a good hide and seek boardgame.

[i]Letters from Whitechapel[/i] had promise, but failed to impress my wife during our first game.  So now I strictly play it with a friend (whom I just happened to sell our copy to).  While a very tense game to play (at least as Jack), whenever the option to play it comes up, I'm not that enthusiastic about it.  A great game to play on occasion, but not one I want to play regularly.

I enjoy Scotland Yard, and found Letters from Whitechapel to be an excellent variation on the theme.  I like the fact that it is more focused and iterative -- there is more focus due to the need to travel to the hideout, and it's more iterative in deduction due to the repetition over multiple rounds.  A wonderful deduction game that I always enjoy to play.  The theme is a harder sell than the more family friendly/neutral of Scotland Yard, especially with some players, but is actually very well done and fits like a glove with the mechanics of the game.

Personally, having played both Letters from Whitechapel and its newer/smaller sibling Whitehall Mystery I prefer Whitehall Mystery and no longer feel the desire to request Letters from Whitechapel unless there are more than 4 players.  Both games are good, but they are so similar that I would rather go with Whitehall Mystery since to me it feels tighter/more focused/has a more interesting map and is shorter.  If you have not played both siblings it's worth trying both since your personal preferences may be different.

The game has a simple, yet clockwork mechanism. Both for Jack and the Investigators, the clock ticks fast, and you can feel the suspense of the chase built with every step. No matter what a few disgruntled investigators might have said, it is equally hard for Jack to escape them.

Retheme of Scotland Yard.  The theme is really strong.  It's harder to catch the criminal, but the police get four chances.  It's quite long for what it is -- probably 2 hours with the full number of players.  It should play two players well.  On the whole, I'd rather play Scotland Yard.

From Jack's perspective - there's tension as the investigators start to close in on your position.  Sometimes one mistake can be your downfall so very thematic.  You need to cover your tracks well.

From investigator's perspective - can be more thinky as you try to narrow down the spaces Jack could have taken.  Can be a lot of information to juggle so it is more fun with a group as you talk about the possibilities.

I love almost everything about the game. The game is oozing with theme, and the mechanics tie in incredibly well with that theme, while still being very clever and unique. One player plays as Jack the Ripper trying to commit 4 murders and escape to his hideout, while everyone else plays as the Police trying to catch him. Easily the best hidden movement game we own.

The gameplay, the components, the quality is all good. It's a fun game.

The thing is, when you realize this is about the killing of real individuals it feels pretty dark. Especially since it has locations of the victims, with their names and dates on the board I believe. I ended up getting rid of it because it just didn't feel right. Yeah it's years and years ago, but imagine playing "columbine the board game"... Jack the Ripper has been glorified in certain modern circles and honestly it shouldn't be. Like I said, great game but realize the theme is off putting to people.

An excellent cat and mouse board game. It might seem complicated at first, but it's actually really simple to setup and play. Each stage of the setup is logical too. When playing as the policemen, the game feels very tensed, especially when the clues lead to dead ends. When playing as Jack, each turn is truly nail-biting, and it persists until the end of the game. As this game has no luck factor involved, whoever wins is truly the more skillful player and the other party respects that. For players who do not like to wait, this game cannot fully show its potential. For those who do not mind spending time to plan and plot, this game is a masterpiece.

This is a great game in so many ways. The rules are a thing of beauty, totally clear and unambiguous. The components are amazing -- this is one of my all-time favorite boards for any game.

As Jack, I feel the tension every turn, and it mounts steadily; lots of close calls. As a detective, it's fun to plan and play cat-and-mouse. It's a different experience with more than two players -- more collaborative, more tense in some ways as Jack. Two-player is sublime.

I also feel the theme, which was fantastic (and I love the theme itself). The board design is a big part of that, with long routes on the sparsely populated outskirts of the district and short hops in the tightly packed alleys -- the design really matches the theme beautifully.

The detectives should avoid writing anything down at all costs. Just talk it out -- building a spreadsheet to track things just bogs the game down, and Jack's turns are almost always going to be quick, thereby boring everyone at the table if the detectives take forever. This applies in two-player games as well.

Reports of this game taking too long are, I suspect, due to doing it "wrong." I've played as the police not writing anything down, and games played that way can take less than an hour and be a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating based on 2 & 6 players.

While not particularly complicated, this game is very heavy and requires concentration--if you play games for light-hearted fun, this is not the one to play. However, the sense of tension is very good.

I wouldn't want to play this game with more than one investigator if I was on that side, though. You really have to coordinate movements in order to capture Jack, and in a group there is almost certainly someone who is going to alpha it, even if they don't mean to. When it comes to this type of game, I like being the boss!

-----------------------------------------

After playing the game (as Jack, and failing miserably) with 5 investigators, I can see the appeal of playing on a team (though it can make things much tougher for Jack!). I still think it's best as a 1-on-1 game, but if you've got a good group for co-ops, there is a lot of opportunity for teamwork.

RATING: 8
Letters is just a masterful game. The most glaring problem with hidden movement games is balance. If one side is more powerful than the other, the game just falls apart, and it's all anyone can think of when playing the game. Letters does a great job of balancing the two sides, AND offering a bunch of variants you can throw in to make one side more powerful if your gaming group is having Jack or the police win more often. They even include extra components for some of these variants, which is a great touch. They realize that every group plays differently, so either Jack or the police will naturally begin having the advantage. If you're a fan of hidden movement games, this is a definite "must own", and if you haven't tried them yet, this is also a great one to test the waters in. It's a pure hidden movement game, no extra game mechanics thrown on top.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating after 1 play: 

I played this as a 2 player with my wife last night. I was Jack and she controlled the detectives. Playing Jack, there is a definite tension to this game. You feel as if you are being swarmed by the police, and you have to do whatever you can to divert them from your hideout. The components are fantastic, though I did have a slight quality control issue with my copy. Nevertheless, I think this is a great game so far.

Update: After a couple more plays, I have to say, I'm slightly disappointed in this game. As Jack, it's fun/semi nerve-wracking to hear the detectives debate about your hideout. So, Jack is fun, not exhilarating, but fun. Being the detective, on the other hand, can be quite dull. Even if you are on Jack's tail, he can screw with detectives so much (because of his movement abilities) that it becomes frustrating when the trail becomes cold. There's also a high degree of luck in the game, which is odd for a middle-weight deduction game. This luck factor comes at the beginning of each turn. If you make the "right" guess early in the round, you are more likely to be on Jack's tail, and force the game into, what I believe it was supposed to be: a race between the detectives and Jack to get to Jack's hideout. However, if you guess wrong (which is usually a 50/50 probability), you (the detective) will be cold the whole round, and it feels like your just going through the motions. There are literally no interesting decisions to be made if you are not on Jack's trail. All you can do is further speculate about Jack's path/current location/hideout. The game just falls flat at that point. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE being a detective in games. This is why I bought the game--because I enjoy deduction. I also don't mind a good challenge. The problem is the game feels quite unbalanced in Jack's favor, even with good detective work. 

I'll still play the game. I like the components, the theme, and the fact that it's cooperative. However, it won't be high on my list. Luckily, my wife enjoys it more than I do. Otherwise, it might be on my trade list.

Straight up brain burner. The problem is, as you are trying to map out Jack's moves, if you're off in your calculations by one spot, that mistake will compound and you will be totally lost within two moves. I enjoy the purity in deduction more so than the ameritrash special powers in Specter Ops, however LFW really overstays its welcome and can be extremely frustrating when you go 45 minutes without finding him. Also, there are some printouts of additional maps you can find in the files on BGG, its very helpful to print out and laminate a few, so you can mark on it.

It’s a crime and investigation game centered on the crimes and pursuit of Jack the Ripper. One player controls Jack, and others are detectives who try to track him down.

Originally I loved this game.. For the first 7 plays.. The concept is great, the game itself is beautiful, everyone that we have played this with really gets into the spirit.. We've gone as far as to buy a top hat, light the room in candles.. It simply oozes theme.. The problem is, it really isn't very hard to catch Jack.. Especially once everyone has played it a couple times.. It's still great to play with a new group of people.. But once they have a couple plays under their belt it becomes too easy to catch Jack..  I hope somehow that they can tweak it in a reprint..

This is an extremely mediocre hidden movement game. It's very simple with very little complexity, but the game takes way freaking long. 

One night can easily last an hour with a full complement of players, and finishing the entire game can take 4 hours if Jack wins. The enjoyment I get from it isn't worth that four hour investment, especially when I can play Escape from Aliens in 10-30 minutes and have a far more tense, enjoyable experience, or just bring out Specter Ops and Fury of Dracula which are similar in mechanics but far superior.

Playing Specter Ops really highlights the problems with this game: it's rare to get that perfect balance between the hunter and the hunted that results in a close game.  In Specter Ops, the variable hunter powers almost always ensures that the game is close, as the Hunters will generally have a good idea of where you are and will only be a step or two behind, unless the Agent is exceptionally skilled and the Hunters are inexperienced. In White Chapel, either you find Jack's Trail or you don't, it's very easy to throw people off, and the Detectives don't have any abilities whatsoever and it can really drag for the detectives if Jack is well-hidden.

The game also fails to scale at all. With more players the game is heavily prone to quarterbacking, and adding players doesn't really do anything but lengthen the game as the mechanics don't change or scale at all. It just adds bland table talk as it's rare to get into heated discussions in this game.

Played the first time with a house rule in order to "fix" something. But the houserule was broken so I dont have a good idea about how the game should play. If it is true that house rules are needed, than this game should get a rating lower than a 5.

But what I can say is this: I like the mr Jack series better.I like the cartoon art better, the shorter playing time and the fact that the detective does not have to remember a lot in order to catch mr Jack. In Letters the detectives need to write a lot of stuff down in order to catch Jack, this slows the game down.

RATING: 5
Lacks the intensity of Fury of Dracula. It's like you took Fury of Dracula and stripped out all the flavor leaving just the chase elements of the game. In terms of it's theme it's not as flavorful as you would expect. I think this game is very much a missed opportunity.

Very tense deduction game, more so for Jack than for the detectives, as being chased around the city to only escape by the skin of your teeth is exhilarating and nerve wracking all at the same time.  Fun to play with non-gamer and gamer groups alike as the theme is easily understood and game play is fairly straight forward.  Easy to recommend for adding some variety to game nights.

However, I can see that Jack also has some significant advantages and prolonged play can lead to issues where experienced Jacks can easily run away with the game.

RATING: 8
So far it seems like a slightly better 2-player game than 3+, because it's important for the investigators to all be on the same page, and usually one or two investigators are far from the action each night. 

Still, the game has a boatload of tension and a relatively simple rule set. Excellent game, my wife loves it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
When it's good, it's very, very good, but when it's bad, it's tedious, unbalanced, and frustrating. It may have something to do with the playgroup though. My first (unrecorded) plays of this were with a boring group, who did almost no discussion, and the game was played like a euro. My most recent play of this was a blast because I sat there (as Jack) and listened to argument, debate, and planning and then could play in a way that was reactive, tactical, and clever - doubling back, subverting the assumptions the investigators made. So maybe this is a game that's dependent on the playgroup? I am beginning to think that increasingly, ALL games are.

Wow! First game was intense and I managed to win as Jack.  First impression is that it is very difficult to win as Jack, although that doesn't seem to be the general consensus here.  I had a little luck and did some doubling back to throw people off my scent which worked but I could have easily been arrested several times with investigators nearby.  On the third night I figured out that I could win if I just committed my last murder close enough to just make a run for it back to my hideout in 2 turns (slipping away by handsome cab).

This game was almost TOO stressful for me.  I'd like to play again as one of the investigators.  Also, it does run a little long, especially, I would think, if you're one of the investigators.  You don't have as much to do.  But as Jack, it's incredibly tense.

Can Jack make it back to his hideout on the four nights he commits murder? Or will the detectives head him off? A similar feel to Fury of Dracula, but (a) no dice (and no combat) and (b) no random event cards. More of a pure strategy game, and probably better for it.

RATING: 9.2
A tense and exciting hidden movement game that plays great with 2 players but is at its best with 3 players.  This is a really elegant and streamlined game of cat-and-mouse where the rules don't get in the way of the interesting game dynamics -- the chase!  

Jack has really difficult decisions to make each turn and is subject to a tremendous amount of game tension throughout.  Getting home each night is always euphoric and extremely satisfying.  

The police often find themselves lost in a fog of confusion.  After loosing the trail, finding a clue again elicits cheers and high-fives.  It feels like a wonderful achievement.

For both sides, this game creates an exciting and engaging experience throughout.  This is a great, great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fine, fine deduction game.  Although it goes down to 2, it really is best with a large group.  The fun of the game is in planning with your compatriats against Jack.  And for Jack, it is in outwitting them all!

Be advised that the Nexus edition, at least, has some serious potential for exploitation by Jack.  Some rules tweaks and a gentleman's agreement can solve it, though.

Letters from Whitechapel improves upon other "hide and go seek" games such as Scotland Yard and Garibaldi.  The theme is well integrated into the components and game play.

There are plenty of strategic opportunities for both sides to pursue.

RATING: 6
First edition...

Whitechapel is dripping with theme and the components are great! The designers have spent a lot of effort to recreate the experience of hunting a serial killer through the streets of 19th century London.

The mechanics work well, though Jack really has to know the rules. We had some games where Jack won because he moved in ways he wasn't really supposed to. When you realize thatafter about 2-3 hours of play, that can be frustrating.

The game is a very intense experience for both sides. We found out that if one player on the police side keeps a protocol of your investigation, Jack has a very hard time.

Whitechapel works best with 2 or 3 players in my experience. You can play with 5, but the game will last forever, downtime will increase and people will get tired after 2 hours. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Not for everyone. I love deduction games, so there's my bias. I'll also admit to having a huge preference for being Jack. The tension you feel as Jack while the detectives swirl around you is incredible. It's also fun to hunt for Jack, but I think a lot of people might find that overly frustrating, especially if one or more of the detectives are overly investing in analyzing every small detail. An "alpha player" can also ruin the experience for his/her fellow detectives. That can make the game long and taxing (even for Jack). So, think things through, but don't go overboard.

My high rating for this game is based on playing with 2 players where there is ALWAYS plenty to do for both players.
This game smooths out the deduction/hidden movement style game play. The trail of clues leading back to Jack's hideout works tremendously well and both players have tobe at their top of their detective game in order to win.
The tension is tremendous as the policemen can be standing right next to Jack looking for clues!
SUPERB!
After a second play and now seeing this game from both sides, my opinion has not changed - FANTASTIC. But.... I would only want to play this as a 2 player head to head game.

RATING: 6.5
Very dry deduction game that has many bluffing and deduction opportunities, but can feel generally uninteresting to play as a single police officer. Jack has a great advantage on the first night that dwindles as the game progresses. If not for the early game clues possibly leading to the hideout, I would recommend starting from the third night for a more interesting game. Also, must be kept moving as there are many mini turns to make and police coordination is a must.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Slippery and cunning, Jack the Ripper disappears into the night as shouts and whistles echo down the lonely Whitechapel streets. The only evidence he or she was ever there is a gruesome murder and a life cruelly taking before its time.
 

I really enjoyed playing this game as both Jack and the police officers. There is a gripping moment of panic when playing as Jack the police are right next to your location however they mistakenly move along, and relief washes over your face as you hurriedly scurry into the night. Alternatively nothing beats the thrills of trailing Jack and finally blocking him/her into a corner and arresting them, proving justice is all. 
This game is a hit at my table and I plan on bring it out time and time again to allow the crazy hunt to continue, and the Letters from Whitechapel to flow.

I'm looking forward to the second edition of this. As I've read more it becomes increasingly interesting to me and i love hidden movement mechanics.
____________________
Update: played it and liked it. I feel like there is some tweaking needed to make it easier for detectives. I like the idea of making it that in any given night, Jack can't backtrack this way there are more clues to follow.  A really fun, no-randomness memory plus deduction plus sneaking game. Very fun, a bit of a brain-burner and won't always be in the mood. Definitely better than scotland yard without much added to the learning curb. Probably better than Ninja legend of scorpian clan though I like the implementation of that theme better. Overall, probably the best hidden movement game played so far and still tight.

UPDATE: Some variants are musts for this game. Allowing players to rush seems like a definite (rush meaning move again isntead of doing an investigation) also area arrests are a good variant. 

Another way to make it harder for Jack and also increase the dynamic nature of the path is make it so that Jack is not allowed to double back unless he has no choice or give him a limit to the number of times he can double back in a single turn.

I was really hesitant to buy this at first, but after reading a few reviews (and really intrigued by the theme) I decided to take the plunge.  

I haven't played anything other than a 2 player game, and the tension is just right.  All of our games have been between 60 and 90 minutes.  I don't see any balance issues, but I firmly believe that the investigators need to use Area Arrests.

I've played both Jack and the investigators and I do have more fun playing Jack.  However, the investigators role is fun and challenging, too.  I would be curious to know if multiple people playing the investigators would take away from the overall experience.  Since I'm not a big fan of co-op games, I'm sure I wouldn't like this game as much.

Overall I think this game shines with 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very beautiful and exciting deduction game. Games are very tense and undecided till the very last moment.

I find the game balanced (I am playing allowing a third move to the policemen instead of the searching for clues or arrest attempt and using a random generator for Jack's hideout). 

It is very easy to learn and play, also because the mechanics are integrated with the theme; it is playable with children and non gamers. 

Recommended.

Our Rating Guide (1 = Disappointed, 3= Hit & Miss, 5= Owned it!)

1. Originality: 5 - Between the beauty of the components, the integration of historical detail, and the fact that this is the first game I've played where I really liked how players play different games, I'm a huge fan.

2. Artwork: 5 - when we first opened the box, all I kept saying is how beautiful the game is. Alright, the pawns and tokens aren't that lovely, they're pretty basic, but the details in the board, the tiles, the letters, even the rule book just astound me.

3. Quality of Contents: 4 - I have the revised edition, so I've been told that the quality of pawns and tokens has increased. They are functional and intuitive. Once again, the beauty of the game really wins for me.

4. Storyline: 5 - It's pretty simple, one person commits the murders, the rest try to catch him. The intensity of getting away or of hunting down your man really comes out in the game play. I love how the game tries to match onto the historical facts, but it's not following so close a storyline that the play becomes predictable. 

5. Playthrough: 5 - It didn't take too long to get the hang of it, and while I have so far only played with 2 players, the game continued to be exciting. 

6. Instructions: 4 - pretty clear for the most part, but of course it did take a few rounds to really get everything into place. 

7. Replayability: 5 - we played 3 full games back-to-back in our first go, so it definitely doesn't feel like it's going to get old any time soon. Adding to the fact that you can switch your role each time you play (being Jack the Ripper or an Investigator), you can really change the type of brain power you'll be investing in your game. I personally prefer being Jack the Ripper because I'm not that great at retaining information, whereas my husband and pretty much retrace my invisible steps just by calculating how many steps I've taken, so he can find me very quickly.

8. Two player: the game play stays the same regardless of number of players, so a 2 player game has no real disadvantage other than limiting opportunities to talk things out with another investigator. That being said, such talk can just end up being more helpful to Jack the Ripper so one player being all 5 Investigators can take more control over the Investigation.

9. Large Group: plays 2-6, and while we haven't tried it out yet, I can imagine some of the differences involved. So, with more than one Investigator, first-player gets chosen randomly. First player gets the job of placing all of the patrol tokens. So, if all of your Investigators communicate and are in agreement and follow through with all of their plans, then you'll have no issues. But I can already think of a few people that I would rather not play this game with simply because sharing control is not everyone's strong suit. Things could get very ugly if the one person made First Player decides to go against what the group agreed upon.

10. Fun Factor - 4. It's a thinking game so it's not going to be an unwinding game. I also feel far more stressed being the only Investigator than I do being Jack the Ripper, or, as I imagine, being a part of a larger group of Investigators who can perhaps keep track of things better than I can. But it's a good stressed, and I might get better with practice. I should also note that we haven't played with any of the variants yet. I'll adjust the review when we start adding these components in.

RATING: 8
Great game! OK, it's a thinker's game, so it's not for everyone. ...and also maybe not when you are a little tired and need a boost. You should want a challenge, to solve a puzzle going into this. The everyone-against-Jack set-up means that you can engage in this game as much as you want, but it can still be an uphill struggle for those who are not fascinated by the opportunity to catch Jack. Ask that person to play Jack instead and at least some of them will change their mind. Jack is a true nervy role to play in the center of everything. (naturally...) I myself can get really obsessed by these kind of mysteries.

RATING: 7
First game we played incorrectly. We missed the rule where all the investigators move first and then search for clues. When we played, every investigator moved and then searched for clues. This really made it hard for Jack (me) to get away. I'm actually quite proud of myself for making it to night 2 with this "impossible for Jack" variant.

RATING: 6.5
So, after having Perry's copy of the game for 4 months, I got to play a round of Letters, playing my first game as Jack. And comparing this to Specter Ops, I think it's a totally different style of game. While Specter Ops is all about the powers, betrayal (with five players) and deception, Letters has the feel of gathering information across multiple rounds/nights.

It honestly feels like a puzzle that is manipulated by the Jack player. He determines where the detectives go, where they search and where to lead them to believe his hideout is. Instead of a hunt (Specter Ops), Letters feels like a chase/race. Jack has to time his getaway correctly as well. He can wait and make it seem as if he is still running around or he can end a round quickly and confuse the cops.

It's hard to tell who has the advantage between the two sides. But I definitely enjoy the game and find hidden movement as more than likely my favorite board game 
mechanic.

Initial Review: 8.75

Edit: I'm starting to see some of the problems with Whitechapel. It does not scale well. The more detectives there are, the more opportunities there are for one or more to become disengaged. And just as big of a problem: it's very long for what it is. At times, I feel like it's a thematic abstract game, so 2-3 hours (which can happen) is a lot. Still really like the game, but I have to drop my score.

I LOATHE hidden movement games.
There is nothing more frustrating than "chasing" the perpetrator around only for them to escape to the other side of the board.
This is not "tense and thrilling chase" it is a tedious and frustrating exercise in wasting my time.

RATING: 7.2
There absolutely no point in playing this game with more than 2 players. This being said, this is an excellent 2-player which provides a lot of tense and a constant feeling of playing with fire (especially for Jack). Playing Jack is definitely hard, but the gaming experience is totally different for both sides of the table. More complex but definitely more interesting than Mr. Jack and other titles in the genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Reviewing Letters From Whitechapel is a difficult thing to do as the play experience as Jack is so different from that of the police. A game as Jack is a tense game of cat-and-mouse and worthy of LfW's high rank on BGG. A game as the police is a frustrating, repetitive affair that one despairs of even by mid-game and is a major turn-off. The game can be very long or anticlimactically short, neither of which is good.

I like cooperative games, competitive games, and partnership games, but the imbalance of the 1 versus everyone else game play I find distasteful. Add to that the serial killer theme and I find very little about LfW to recommend.

Plus, the game's 'Waiting To Kill' phase is illogical: The movement of the Wretched allows for murders to occur in the same area multiple times, and the waiting gives Jack more time to escape rather than less.

RATING: 7
Probably the best deduction game I have played to date.  I have only played it two player and I thought it worked really well.  I was the killer, and I could see that perhaps in the beginning the police are kind of scouring random areas just hoping for a hit, but once they start getting some evidence, the game starts to shine.

With the idea of committing the murder, you give the police a good place to start their recon, but it can still be tough to get some evidence.  Never the less the one game we played I was one move away from winning on the fourth night and my wife caught me.

Very cat and mouse, this game works well for two players.  I am on the fence on whether to buy it or not, but a good deduction game for two.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Clearly inspired on Scotland Yard (clrealy improves it), and also have some elements in common with Fury of Dracula (it can be defined as a streamlined version of FoD). Deduction game for the police players and bluffing game for Jack.

The game is very streamlined, a simple mouse and cat deprived of all almost the elements that could bog down the game flow.

The components are great and the theme is perfectly implemented. 

The main drawback is its lenght (3 hours).

I'm not sure if I'll ever buy it, since I already own FoD.

Letters is a highly thematic "fox-and-geese" game similar to Scotland Yard or Fury of Dracula. One player controls Jack the Ripper; selecting a victim and announcing the scene of crime, while the other 1-4 players work together as a team of police, searching and attempting to catch Jack before he escapes to his lair. Movement is point-to-point, although Jack has some special movement options that he can only use once or twice each night. There are four rounds: on each "night" Jack has fewer victims to choose between, and hopefully the detectives have begun to work out where his lair is. The game becomes very tense, and quite exciting.

Co-op game.  Frustrating "search for Jack the Ripper" motif...  Too easy for one to dominate the search and the others just do the mechanics.  - Don't bother.

Simple and easy meachanics, totally similar to Scotland Yard, but the game retheming worked very well and the new rules and components are good. 
It's only problem is that its length strongly depends on whether Jack decides to take a London's tour or to go straight home... it can last from 1 to 3 hours! It is also strongly dependent on the number f players.

Contemporary and improved variant of Scotland Yard, more thematic and sinister, naturally.

On the other hand, I'm not sure if the additional playing time pays off. I should have known of Fury of Dracula before, maybe...

I receive the game yesterday, and really after waiting for this reprint since last october it's quite a blast to finally being able to play....

I only did one game with my wife, i was jack, and i lost during the third night:P. As it was the first game we did, it was more for testing the mechanics, but as for jack, i can really tell you better not make mistake because the police really narrow you down well.
so impatient to play again and i feel that this game really reward the player that made the less mistake and that win the brain fight, so if you loose you can't tell it's because of bad luck or anything, in this amazing game, if you loose it's just because you got beaten fair and square by a better player

Thematically, this is one of my favorite games; and the board and its components are gorgeous. This one-versus-all, hidden movement game is very tense and always a thrill to play, no matter what side you're on or how large the group is. I remember leaping into the air with joy when I found a clue or my heart pounding with fear when investigators came close to my hideout. Fraught with tension and anxiety, Letters from Whitechapel is an immersive dive into the world of Victorian London. Time between player's turns and AP can be an issue but I hardly noticed the time passing.

I thought it was an improvement on Scotland Yard, which is just as well as you wouldn't want to go to all the effort of re-making it only to be worse. I liked the theme, and I liked how the multiple rounds and the variations in setup in each round invoked the multiple Jack The Ripper murders. It seems like a challenge to get away with it. It still seems like anything more than 2 players is superfluous, unless you want to share an experience. The components are solid. In essence it's the same game, trying to narrow down the lone guy's options so there's no need to have both, or all 3 if you include NY Chase, but if you have none and you're drawn by the elimination-of-options process, you won't be getting the poor man's cousin going with this one.

This is an execllent deduction style game similar to Scotland Yard.  The mechanics are not difficult to grasp, in my opinion, but the strategy of working as a team to corner and arrest Jack offer a lot of possibilities.

I've only played once so far, but the game I did get to play was tense from start to finish both for Jack and the police.  It also seems like this has great replay potential since each game will inevitably write its own "story."

Great game that really completes the hunting game collection. I love Schotland Yard for its simplicity and how quickly the investigators get engaged in it. I love Fury of Dracula for its theme and how the mechanics work, I really like this one for its more serious tone in terms of how the mechanics work. There really is a lot of deduction in this game for the investigators, which is really great.

I have played this once and I probably wont play it again. 

Deduction games aren't really my thing. No, I'm not bad at deduction, rather the opposite, but I think it's boring. And I'm not much for cooperative games either. So even though my expectations were low the game didn't even get there. 

It's loooooooong, and all you do is repeat and repeat and repeat the same simple actions - for hours. If the game had ended after one (of four) rounds it had been almost OK, but no, repeat again three times. 

It might be a better two player game, but it certainly isn't suitable for six, or five, or four (we started off with six players, but only four had the stamina, or in my cace stubbornness, to suffer through to the end).

This game is fantastic, if a little long. The asymmetry of the two side and the tensions that it creates are up there with the best. I really like the theme and have no issue with playing Jack, like some seem to on BGG; I feel that the theme gives the police real incentive.

The turn structure can look daunting when viewed on paper, but in reality this game runs along as smooth as you can imagine. The majority of the game consists of the chase after each killing and it is this phase that makes the game so enthralling. The player taking on Jack's role can spend the entire time filled with tension, hoping that the police won't watch on while he weaves his way through the London streets towards his hideout and the police spend much of their time totally baffled at how the clues have created the path that they have, often thinking that Jack is long gone, when he is really only one or two steps ahead.

I only wish that the game was a little shorter. As Jack in particular the experience can be mentally exhausting; one that is worth it though.

This game is a lot of fun! It's easy to learn and teach. New players can jump right into the action their first play-through which makes this a perfect game for when you have those friends over you don't see on a regular basis swing by for game night. 

Playing as Jack and playing as the investigators provides 2 completely different experiences. You will definitely feel pressure when playing as Jack. It's fun to hear what the investigators are talking about. There has been quite a few times where they were going to make an arrest on the spot I am in but decided to choose a different location. You need a good poker face. Close calls like those are what makes the game so thrilling. 

The only downside is once you really get to know the game as Jack, you can easily outsmart the investigators. You need to add some variants in to help out the investigators or you will almost always escape. I have yet to be caught as Jack but always have close calls during the game so for me, it's still as exciting as my first play through.

One play and I'm not really convinced: sure there where the tense moments, where you find clues and feel like you're catching him, but when you've lost track it's just random moves and calling out numbers in the hope you'll find something and that's quite repetitive/dull.

Very engrossing game. One player plays Jack the Ripper, the other(s) play the detectives and vigilantes trying to catch him. The game is played over a beautifully rendered map of the Whitchapel neighbourhood and the goals are simple: each murder night (there are 4 in total), Jack has 15 turns to get from the murder scene to his hideout. If he fails to do so in any of these nights - whether by being caught or by running out of time, he loses the game.

THe mechanics are very simple. The map consists of a series of circles (used exclusively by Jack) and dots (used by the police players). After choosing a victim,  Jack registers his moves on a grid hidden from the other players and, each turn (plus a few that allow him to move two circles or cross a block. These looking for clues (i.e. if Jack passed through a certain circle) or declaring an arrest in circles adjacent to the dot the detective's pawn is in.
What is great about this game is that it is fun not only for the player playing Jack but also for the others. For Jack, it's about teasing the police and get to the hideout in the right time: follow an excessively direct route and you will reveal the whereabouts of the hideout too easily; follow an excessively tortuous rout and you risk running out of turns to get there. For the police players is about and methodically closing down the circle on Jack and restricting his possible moves.   
Highly recommended, but be ready for some 2+ hours of play if the game goes all the way.

Edit: I tired from the game after a few more plays. It's assymetrical in play and also on the fun factor: great if you play Jack, not so much if you're the Detectives. In a game of 2+ hours, it is two much.

RATING: 8
It's an interesting deduction game. It's really a 2-player game, as when you play with more than two, the other two players just kind of bounce thoughts off each other. In a lot of co-op games the players work together but can choose their own actions (Ok I am going to handle this, what are you doing", but in Whitechapel it's more of a "How do we place all 5 to block Jack here". The good side is as you only need 2 and everyone works as one, people can drop it and out at will.

RATING: 6
On paper, this game is marvelous. In practice, it gets bogged down by intense analysis. But the real game killer is that if the detectives make more than a minor mistake, then they're screwed and there might be another 60-90 minutes of gameplay before they realize they've already lost.

It's MUCH better with 2 players, as having multiple detectives causes table talk, which helps the bad guy.

Weight comes from the game more than the mechanics... there are a lot of possibilities to consider.

A frustrating yet ultimately rewarding hidden movement game.
More casual gamers may be deterred by the long play time but personally I enjoy games that require an evenings commitment.
Yet to play as Jack, so can only speak from playing as a cop, but I really enjoyed working as team to track down Jack.

Played this game as the detectives in a two player event.  It was really interesting, but my friend who played the Ripper made a few too many audible clues which led to a victory on the third night.  You really need a poker face for this game!  Would love to play it again!

On the fourth play bumped my rating from a 7 to an 8. By far my favourite deduction game. Lots of tension, fun moments and games are memorable after you've played. Many games can't say that. The only thing not to like is the theme, which I do agree is a little disturbing. 

If I introduce it to newbs I will change it to a Prison break theme, where you are a resistance fighter during WW2 breaking out valuable assets from the enemy and escorting them back to your hideout.

Deep and engaging cat-and-mouse deduction game. It's tense for Jack as he tries to evade and deceive the policemen, and the policemen have enough to think about that you need to take notes and really think things through, but not so much that you can get totally lost. The policemen work together as a team, so you have all the pros and cons that go with a cooperative game.

Played the game wrong (coppers only could check once a turn), wrote it off as the theme of the game was that the cops were incompetent; obviously Jack got away.  Still had fun, so I stand by the 6 rating.

Playing with more than two players just divvies up the cops, essentially means you need a lot more discussion to come to same decisions you could do as a single player controlling all 5 cops.

A deduction game with simple mechanics. It is a many against one as the detectives cooperatively try to find Jack the Ripper.

RATING: 8
Sometimes I feel guilty over giving so many of my games a rating of 8 or better. Then I realize it's because I try not to keep games in my collection that I'm not very impressed with or excited to get repeated plays from. I don't want a huge board game collection filled with a bunch of 4's and 5's.

Whitechapel is a confident 8, and a game I know I'm going to want to hold on to. 

From the stellar FFG components and graphics, to the dark and twisted theme. Simple to learn. It's a clever design. Everything makes sense and creates a game where the tension is always mounting. There are moments where you actually gasp when you realize the killer has slipped right through you fingers, that he had just been [i]right[/i] there next to you.

It scales down to 2-player very well, plays fast once you get the hang of it, and so far feels pretty balanced. 

There are no dice rolls, no cards draws, There seems to be no element of 'luck' at all. The way to win is to out-think you're opponent. It calls on you to be cunning, brave and just a little bit twisted. 

It's really unlike anything in my collection of pretty great games.

RATING: 8
Tense game of cat and mouse. Enormously stressful but rewarding to play as Jack. Great to play on the deduction side as well.
Each game I played had new players. Twice we had an early arrest but the other times the game took a really long time. Way past the 90 minute indication on the box. So be prepared for a long(er) haul with this one.

RATING: 7
We need more plays of this to really see if it's fun for everyone. Jack is almost always going to have a good time, whether he wins or loses. But most investigators are out of place for making contributions until a few turns into each night. And if they aren't able to track Jack and find clues, then it's simultaneously frustrating and boring. So hopefully we can get this to the table a few more times and learn to love it.

A bit excessively long, but absolutely brilliant.
A thrilling game of nervous bluffing and pure deductive logic.  An intense brain burning exercise with no randomness whatsoever; only wits and guile.

Letters from Whitechapel vastly outshines other games with similar DNA such as Fury of Dracula and Specter Ops.

RATING: 7
A compelling game. I've added victim pictures, a timer to rush the detectives (a bit), and a mini-maglight for the head investigator to "point" things out on the map; all these add a bit of atmosphere.

We also use the "Todd" rule, which allows detectives to run (move 3) if they don't search. This helps pull players back into the game if the have been assigned to the outskirts at the beginning of turns. 

I'd like to hear more about other house rules.

Fans of Fury of Dracula and Scotland Yard will find another chase/investigation game to like here.  The production quality is quite good.  The map is understandable, but one must look at it closely.  Sometimes the  black dotted lines for the investigators travel blend too much into the black squares that limit the movement range of the investigators.  It takes vigilance to keep it straight.  The Map has more points of investigation than did Fury of Dracula, so if FoD wasn't enough searching for you, this should scratch your itch.

OK but I much prefer Fury of Dracula for this fix. See my review for more details, but in general: The deductive element is a bit deeper than it is in Fury, but without any of the other elements in place (resource management and risk/reward options) the game ends up feeling much less interesting.

Also, thematically this feels very dry, whereas Fury is very evocative and flavorful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
No frills deduction game. Even with the theme, I'd rather play Fury, as deduction games are not my thing - and Fury has loads of cards and combat. It overstayed its welcome and in the end I just wanted it to end, though others in the group seemed to enjoy it. We did play with six, however. Perhaps two or three players would be more fun?

There's no other game that provides me with the same feeling of tension as this game does when playing as Jack.

When i was young i played Scotland Yard many times and like it very much. This is a great game that replaced it. Both sides of game are very interesting. As the Reaper you try to balance between taking risks and trying to get policemen to run in circles and just runing towards your hideout. When you chase you try to get into the head of the murdurer and guess witch way he took. Overall very good deduction game.

Too much information, not engaging enough for all players involved. This is a game that easily suffers from quarterbacking, and the type of calculation involved is incredibly complicated and results in a lot of downtime.

Worse, it seems like the game is slanted against the investigations. So it's pretty sad that a large amount of deduction results in an "oh we miscalculated that bit back 2 hours ago and have been wrong ever since". Very anti-climatic.

This game was just simply fantastic. The rules are simple enough to learn and the game play is fantastic. A 1 vs many hidden movement game as Jack makes his killings and tries to get back to his hideout in each of the 4 nights. The 5 investigators are searching for clues to track Jack's whereabouts, locate his hideout, and make an arrest. This game was very thematic and suspenseful. As Jack you really feel as if you're being hunted. It's not boring with AP prone people, but it can double the length of the game. Also, need to be careful of one person on the investigator side taking over and quarterbacking the entire time. Its likely not on purpose. The game just really sucks people in.

RATING: 8
Klassisches, und nicht nur meines Erachtens ‚das‘ klassische Deduktionsspiel um „Jack the Ripper“ für 2-6, eigentlich aber für 4-6 Personen. Zentraler Mechanismus: „Jack“ muß in bestimmten Nächten, innerhalb eines bestimmten Zeitfensters Morde begehen (hierfür stehen unterschiedliche Opfer ‚zur Verfügung‘) und dann zurückkehren zu einem anfangs von ihm (geheim) festgelegten Versteck. Hieran sollten ihn die Polizisten hindern. Der Spielplan von London ist so gestaltet, daß sich Jack und die Polizisten nie (!) auf einem Feld begegnen können, sie können nur einander benachbart sein (was den Polizisten jedoch für die angestrebte ‚Verhaftung‘ reicht). Höchst spannend, einfache Regeln (die das Spiel indes positiv vom guten, alten „Scotland Yard“ absetzen). Und es gibt ‚Blutspuren‘.

Beware of so many posts complaining the game is broken and that Jack is too hard to arrest.  This is simply not true, however, the game does take a certain "know how" when playing the detectives. When I play the detectives I almost always capture Jack.

Similar to Scotland Yard. The graphical design is appropriate, but is also murky, hindering the "readability" of the board.

It doesn't really improve on the hidden movement experience from childhood favourite Scotland Yard.

I don't like how you "restart" the hunt over and over, and the clumsy mechanics, that is used, if Jack doesn't kill right away makes no sence neither in the game nor thematically.

A cynical Jack player can win the games in 15 minutes, not leaving the police officers a chance.

Even if you use a random hideout generator, for a game that is almost as long as Fury of Dracula, this lacks flavour and depth. It's tense but mostly for the Jack player.

Some might prefer a more "pure" hidden movement experience than Fury of Dracula, but I would go for a shorter and simpler game than this one.

I see this as a 2P or perhaps 3P game only as more Policemen wouldn't be very fun to play.  3P is interesting as each police player has some interaction and Jack can hear some of the dialogue on plans and what the thoughts are.

I have seen the variant of allowing Police to move without performing an action, but suggest it be ignored for beginning players.  This super-move does allow the police to close the net very quickly and the Jack player needs to be astute to avoid getting ensnared - something that likely comes with experience in the game.

A nice deduction game with great tension on both sides.  Jack as he attempts to bluff and mislead his way back to his hideout, the police as they try to close the noose tighter and tighter around Jack.  Careful attention to the board and forethought on moves required on both sides.

Quite possible one of the best hidden movement games I've seen. It's tense, it really captures the feel of the desperation, the frustration of losing a trail and the moment when you hone in on Jack. The murder portion of the game can almost be looked over for the players who find this hard and it becomes a purely deductive reasoning game, but the theme can also be expressed and work well with Halloween.

I really enjoyed this and would play it anytime. Unfortunately the horror of the real events make it unsuitable for many family members and non-gamers, even though it's a perfect fit and well presented. Therefore the game loses a half-point or so simply because I can't bring it in front of half of the audiences which whom I'd like to share it. Otherwise I'd own this, because it fulfills both the co-op and the competitive deduction urges nicely.

RATING: 7
13-06-2015. Rated after 1 play. In the game, one player plays Jack the Ripper, murdering wretches over several nights. The other players are police trying to catch Jack.

Each night, you have several potential wretches you can kill as Jack. The Police gets to draw the wretches closer every time you don't kill a wretch. You have to kill one in a couple of turns, but you can manipulate when.

Once you kill a wretch, you are at the location of the wretch. You then are allowed to move to a hidden location one space away, or two spaces away if you use a carriage or to an unconnected location within the same area. You then run away towards your at the start selected hide-out.

The agents try to find you, by asking at locations if they can see you. With that, they try to hunt you down and arrest you before you go back home.

I like the game, but it's slow and thinky. It's good, but really works best with a low player count and it MAY be too serious for me. Regardless, it works fine and if you enjoy those kind of games it might just be it for you.

For the big hidden-movement game for the collection, it was going to be this or Fury of Dracula.  I played a few games of this at a cafe, and it was pretty neat, but I was attracted more to the theme and additional mechanics in FoD.  Now that I've played both, I am happy with the decision, but this is still a good game.  For those who are more interested in fair competition, and in deduction with fewer distracting elements, I think this would actually be the better of the two games.

I used to own and love Fury of Dracula. Then I played Letters from Whitechapel, and it did everything I loved about FoD in half the time. The fun for me is guessing, second guessing, third guessing and so on, where Jack is. The cat and mouse game is amazing, and what a different experience it is playing the other side. One of my favorites.

Tense! Atmospheric! Thematic! A really great game that uses the "Scotland Yard" mechanism but with much more other ingredients. It's soooo thrilling for both sides the inspectors and Jack. And the murderer's solution at the end of the game was really interesting to listen to. How close were the officers some moments? Love this game!

RATING: 3
This game is awful. Given the topic and the indeed fantastic effort that the authors put in the art and in all the included material about Jack and it's history, you would expect a game made with the exact same dedication. What you instead have is a sloppy clone of Scotland Yard with the pace of a slug that crawls with a limp. Really, the only player that can really have an almost sadistic fun with this game is the one running Jack (at least until he/she realize he would have to wait tons of minute every turn while the investigators try to make up their mind about their moves), or the investigators if Jack is playing bad. There is really no middle ground about that. Even if the skill level of both sides is equal, it's still boils down to an endless stream of "are you there?" "no" "are you there?" "no" "are you there?" "no" and so on. The only way investigators can try to win is by guess, given that they know where Jack was at step one, where he may have passed at step three of four, because go for the easiest path (find step two) will easily allow Jack to cover more and more distance in the meanwhile, therefore giving away nigh to 0 clues about the location of his hideout.

There is really nothing much else to say. Fury of Dracula, which is surely not the perfect game too, is a way more engaging and interesting Scotland Yard-like game. This one is recommended only for those ones who really likes the idea of breaking their minds on a simple and pure "where is the other guy" problem.

RATING: 8
Was afraid that this was merely a stripped version of Fury of Dracula, and perhaps only a half-step forward from Scotland Yard, but was surprised by its elegance. There are some downtime for the police, and the map is unclear at a few places (are some crossing dots intended to be placed slightly away from the actual crossing or not, some complex building blocks make the legality of the alley special movement unnecessarily interpretable), but it's overall a good playing experience.

Like the concept and game mechanics.  Easier to teach/learn than it seems at first.  After 2 plays, however, the game semms imbalanced toward the police as neither Ripper player was able to escape round 1.  There are tools to address this that we will try to include on future plays.   Two more plays; another easy catch on second movement.  First successfull game as Jack!  Now I think it may start leaning the other way as I have assessed the strategy for Jack better...

The game is set in the time of the infamous Jack the Ripper. Every night, someone is murdered and the assassin tries to get into his hideout before getting caught. If he hasn't been arrested after the 4th turn of the game, he wins the game.

A very fun deduction game with it's roots in Scotland Yard, but this game is much deeper.  I worry this might be too easy for the Jack player to win though, as if you can make it through the first two nights (not too difficult), you can have a hideout chosen near a crime scene and get home quicker than the police have time to respond to in nights three and four.

Ten out of ten for quality components. The board is large and beautiful and the pieces are all carved wood (at least in the Revised Edition). Based on three games of Letters from Whitechapel, I think the entire game rests on how good the player is who is controlling Jack. At least in my experience, if Jack is even a little competent then it's almost impossible for the police to catch him without a huge stroke of luck.

Very fun game. Can be a blast whether you are on the police side or playing as Jack the Ripper - though of course, playing as Jack is particularly fun especially if you are playing against a group of players for the police side. I put a pair of really dark aviator shades in the box to go with it for Jack, since other players will try to watch your eyes to help determine your moves in whatever general area. It adds to the theme in a sense, but the primary reason is to cover your eyes. Is relatively quick, too, considering most other games I have in my collection.

A hide-and-seek style game (as "Mr. X in New York" or "Scotland Yard"). Probably one of my favorite games as it requires planning, teamwork, tricking and spyching the other players. If you add none of the "extra rules" for the police the game is way to easy for Jack, but don't add all as it gets impossible to win as Jack.

Amazing game both as Jack and detectives. I really love hidden movement and deduction. For now, Jack is unbeatable with all detective variants included (except teritorial arrest) but every game is still interesting for both sides.

I was hoping this would serve as an easier-to-teach as well as faster-to-play hidden movement game besides Fury of Dracula, but unfortunately the adventage in playtime and rules complexity isn't significant enough to open up this type of game to new player groups. As a result, even though I still like Whitechapel, it'll almost always loose against Fury of Dracula when it's time to play some hidden movement game.

I guess this one might be better than Fury of Dracula for two players, but so far I didn't have a large enough 2-player-timeslot to confirm that.

Played a single game of this and it was pretty good. I quite like deduction games, this one is thematic, it looks stunning, and it is pretty easy to explain. The only issue is playing with six very good players there simply isn't enough to do for each detective. Depending on you location as a detective you could well play two hours and not really feel like you have had much impact beyond contributing to group discussions. 

I think the tension for Jack must be fantastic matching against five minds, but unless you could get everyone willingly take five goes as detectives for every one turn as Jack you will not likely be able to replicate that 1 vs 5 often.

Good solid game so far. Just doesn't quite provide an even experience for six competent players to all sink their teeth into.

Police 07 Londonban. Hasfelmetsző Jack 5 gyilkosságot követ el a városban. A rendőrök a nyomait keresik és megpróbálják elkapni. Szinte egy az egyben ugyanaz a játék. Jó ötlet, hogy más pontokon lépkednek a rendőrök, mint Jack. Jó ötlet a lépés egyszerűsítése is. Jack fixen egyet (jokerekkel máshogyan is), a rendőrök pedig 0-1-2 mezőt léphetnek. Így jobban lehet koncentrálni a játék lényegére. A módosítások javítottak a játékon. A kivitel szép. Viszont ez tényleg fix kétszemélyes játék, fölösleges többen leülni hozzá. A dedukciós játékokat kedvelő pároknak bátran ajánlható. Részemről nem érzem hosszútávon szórakoztatónak, nem érzek benne sok újrajátszást.

Bombed on my first play-through with my husband and I'm not sure what went wrong. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect between each of the rounds, meaning it feels a bit clunky, but more plays and familiarity with the board might help. It can be really hard to make out some of the detail on the map, meaning that the Ripper player might end up giving themselves away squinting to see what the pursuers are up to. Tip: play in good lighting and not with the board upside down for the Jack player. ;)

Wanted this as a 2 player Fury of Dracula alternative, a game I love, since Fury of Dracula, while great with any player count, is a little bit fiddly for the hunters with just one player controlling all and the lack of conversation makes 2 player seem like something is missing.

Turns out it is a poor replacement because it's pretty much barebones deduction and almost an abstract with regards to gameplay -- which is fine, but makes it pretty much the opposite of Fury of Dracula which gets its greatness in part from its rich atmosphere and the fact that it has more goign on (combat, encounters, card play, etc.)

Design seems tight and well thought out, but looking at the map and wrapping your head around the movement (whcih is on a different grid for Jack and the Detectives) is kinda confusing so I'll dock it a point for that.

Also, no way in hell this is anything more than a 2, maybe 3 player game. No. way. In. Hell. "2-6 players" is just ridiculous...

Am interested in the gameplay, but it's definitely not going to be satisfying my itch for Fury of Dracula.

One vs. all asymmetric deduction game.  One player plays Jack the Ripper, and the others play the detectives assigned to track him down.  The deduction element is very heavy, and can be very overwhelming at times, but it's a generally fun experience.  In terms of how it fits into my collection, I think it scratches a similar itch to Tragedy Looper, and personally, I think I prefer Tragedy Looper of the two.  However, I feel like the theme (and aesthetic) of Letters from Whitechapel is much more accessible and easier to explain.

This game is really cool, and our group got right into it. It's pretty intense when you play as Jack, especially if the Police players are getting too close! We had a blast with this game and look forward to more plays.

One bit of disappointment is how few sheets come in the tracking pad for Jack's movements. A blank one can be scanned/printed or photocopied however, so it's a minor quibble.

This is a great game!

Oh how I want to LOVE this game!!  I love the theme - it really draws me in.  I feel a real sense of urgency tracking down Jack.  Even more than that, I love Deduction Games.  This game really scratches that itch for me.

Everyone in my gaming group agrees that the game is very unbalanced in favor of Jack.  Unless the player moving Jack is not even trying, and goes DIRECTLY from the murder to the hideout without taking any circuitous routes or backtracking...then maybe, you can catch Jack.  

I've seen comments about ways to balance this game and I hope to try them out with my group (unless my group is too frustrated to play again).  I really hope it balances the game because everything else about this game is SPOT ON for me!!!

I had played a friend's copy and didn't actually liked the game. Still I gave the game one more chance and actually fell in love with it more and more, until I bought my own copy. What can really kill this game is a group of police officers suffering from Analysis/Paralysis or not working together, making Jack's escape even too easy. Other than that, a very exciting cat&mouse game. I still probably prefer Fury of Dracula for its theme but this is an extremely good game.

RATING: 8
Pros
- Great component quality
- Very tense turns when you know the Police are very close to finding Jack
- High replayability due to Jack being able to select his hideout at the very beginning of the game
- Great creepy theme that really shines, despite this ultimately being an abstract game

Cons
- Games can run a little long
- Seems imbalanced in favor of the Police (My wife and I have played around 15 times, and Jack has only one twice; both were when we first started playing and didn't understand good Police strategy), but this can make the challenge of playing as Jack fun

Highly recommended because of the tension this game creates - it's unlike any other game I've played in that regard.

--- Summary ---
One player is Jack. The others control the 5 detective pawns in the game. The board is a map of Whitechapel, with streets creating blocks. There are stops on all the streets, different for investigators and for Jack/victims. At the start of the game, Jack picks a location as his secret hideout. 

Each day (of 5!), Jack places the potential victims and, over the next several rounds, decides which one to kill. Then, he starts to make his getaway, recording his every step on a secret sheet one by one (may use a carriage or alleyway a limited 0-2times, depending on which round it is, to take multiple steps or a shortcut). At the same time, the other players move their detectives and search for clues: when they stop moving, they ask Jack if he was at an adjacent location (may keep asking until they hear "yes"). If they think he's there now, they can try to capture him instead of investigating (if successful, they win; otherwise, Jack does).

If Jack makes it to his hideout, the day ends and you repeat the above. The detectives can shift the position of 2 of their pawns, and Jack cannot use a starting location where he's already killed. And on one of the days, there are 2 murders instead (with detectives getting to move in between). Otherwise, though, you repeat the above until all the murders are complete and Jack makes it home again, or until Jack is found.

I kind of like the hidden movement mechanism, but it felt really repetitive and boring despite the tension of having the detectives SO close to Jack many times! Scotland Yard might me more to my liking -- from what I hear, it has similar mechanics but plays much more quickly?

RATING: 7.5
Have played the game a number of times with 2, 3 and 4 players.  The game is intense from the outset.  Playing Jack is a different experience to playing the cops.  This is a brain-burner game so be prepared to turn the thinking caps on.  It's not my favorite style of game so won't hit the table very often, but happy to have it in my collection.

RATING: 5
Hidden movement/chase games just aren't for me.  I loathed Nuns on the Run and didn't care for Scotland Yard.  For me, too, this game is nearly a Scotland Yard clone but with an extra 2 hours of play time tacked on.  No thank you.

Each round begins with a bit of setup/preparation.  Jack the Ripper can buy himself more time during the actual chase phase of the round while also learning the locations of investigators while the investigators can move the target pawns into better positions.  Honestly though, very little is gained this way and it just feels like more time added to a game that already feels too long for what it is.

Then the chase half of a round feels exactly like Scotland Yard but changed for the worse in a way that makes it take so much longer.  Jack moves secretly every round and then the investigators move and search for Jack on surrounding locations or attempt to make an arrest.  In this way each investigator has to name off surrounding locations one at a time (since you can only find one clue on a turn) looking for clues.  Jack still has special move tokens but he doesn't have to reveal his location when he uses one in this game.  In order to make an arrest you don't simply need to wind up on Jack's space either, you need to make an arrest at his exact location.

Also, this goes on for 4 rounds.  Just too long and a clone of a game I already didn't particularly enjoy.  I will say that it all works well together and if this is the type of game you would enjoy I think it is a great entry into the genre.  It's just not for me and I certainly am not going to spend this much time playing a game that doesn't resonate with me.

Solid Game.  More streamlined than Scotland Yard, which is a good thing.  You don't have to concern yourself with the mode of transportation (taxi, bus, etc) though my oldest daughter liked that about Scotland Yard.  Both my girls weren't liking the Jack The Ripper theme.  I felt that it made the game more thematic and LFWC drips with theme.  A lot of tension for  both sides in the game and I liked the breadcrumb trail of the investigators searching for clues.  They get a sense of the path you took but not the complete picture.  My only negatives might be that it runs a tad too long and the opportunity to move the victims/investigators  before the chase is a little clunky.  That said, you are deeply engaged the entire time.

This game can take up to 4/5 hours, or if Jack is a newbie maybe 5 minutes. Simple rules, cooperative game-based with choices and possibilities everywhere. As Jack, you will have fun with messing up with people's mind, or your blood pressure go really hight (why?) because police can be one step behind you. And as cops, don't be overjoy. You might be running in circle, because you can't find glues. 

Recommend to play when you have a whole afternoon off, because you can take you time to think and might as well enjoy the atmosphere of the game.

Superb deduction game: one player takes Jack the Ripper and the other is the police hunting him down. Jack moves secretly but the police can block intersections and search for clues along his trail. Components are gorgeous. It's basically a gamer's version of Scotland Yard with an extremely grim theme.

One of the most charming aspects is how thematic it all feels. Even many seemingly "gamey" tactics, such as the cops indiscriminately arresting passersby, are perfectly in the spirit: in the real investigation over 80 suspects were detained.

It's a wonderful game of cat-and-mouse... albeit one where it does not pay to dwell on the details of what precisely is being simulated.

Update 2: My wife isn't as fond of this game as I certainly am, so doesn't hit table as often as I'd like. She is ok with playing the Police but finds playing Jack too stressful. Mark down 1/2 point :(

Played 4/29.  1 - 2 player game and 1 - 4 player game.  Initial comments:  The game has a lot of similarities to Scotland yard.  We really enjoyed the game and it seems to be well balanced.  There are a couple of rules that are a little ambiguous, but we worked through them.  An example is the rules say to leave the police where they are, but other rules and cards say that you will be replacing the police.  We decided that we would remove them and replace them as that seemed to be the rule.  Essentially, the end of the first turn and the start of the second round is a little ambiguous.

After playing thrice, once as Jack and twice as a detective, I have to say that this game is really good. However, I've yet to be on the losing side, so I'm not sure how frustrating it would be to go through the entire game and only pick up a few clues which lead nowhere (which is what happened when I played Jack). overall, though I really like the blind movement and the asymmetrical play.

Some interesting ideas here. The mechanics and theme fit together well. The only problem I have with the game is the simplicity of it. The "Letter" cards and "Special Movement Tokens" do spice it up a bit, but I feel like the game is a little bland for the amount of time it takes.

Still, probably the best "cat and mouse" deduction game out there.

Playing as Jack is incredibly fun.  You get to dodge and avoid the police while killing victims.  The downside is that being a detective is outright terrible.  Jack is gone after the first turn and there's almost nothing you can do to find him again, aside from getting incredibly lucky.  There's too much stuff on the board to get in the way of adjacency.

If I could always play Jack, I'd rate this a 6.  Since I'd likely have to play a detective, which I'd never want to do, I'll rate it a 3.

This went down really well. Played with friend and parents. Was concerned with the semi co-operative nature of the game at first as the parents have never played co-op style games before. But were immediately and clearly invested in catching Jack (me) from the first night. Sadly my reign as The Ripper ended after being cornered after the double event. The only concern was the length of the game (the game had gone on for 4 hours by the time of capture on Night 3)... but will chalk that up to being the first time playing the game.

Really nice, neat, easy to play deductive game. For me personally it probably falls short of a 9 or a 10 purely because of the lack of variety in strategy, the very simple mechanic of checking squares and deducing Jack's path is almost the entire game. Having said that though it's good at what it does, after 10+ plays I've found it to be well balanced, and I like the beautiful little Jack and investigator figures.

One additional point on the cooperative side of the game: I don't think there's enough of a co-operative side to this as the investigators. I really enjoyed playing with other people just because we could chat about ideas and it really felt like an investigation team trying to catch the criminal. That having been said the actual game itself didn't really mechanically add anything for having one or multiple investigators even though it was fun both ways.

As at the time of writing these comments I have had 5 games, all 3 player. Jack (emma on this occasion) has won once. Other games went to the police. However, gameplay does not feel as one sided as this might suggest. I have played police every time so far and there are times when you feel the desperation of things slipping away from you and that you will never be able to catch jack and then.... You pick up a clue.... And another nearby and suddenly the chase is back on and adrenalin pumps! This is a fantastic game that has jumped to the top of my favourite 'long games' list overnight. The deduction can feel overwhelming (so many branching routes that jack could have taken) but a well thought out and methodical search will help - although on its own will not be enough. You need to also attempt to get into the rippers head and figure out what he might have done if you want to stay on the trail. Catching him up, getting ahead and arresting are not easy and require the narrowing down of the likely hideout address and routes to and from. It feels like a real achievement when you finally slap the cuffs on him! I really love the game. However, I can see why some may not. Firstly, it's really not easy to track down jack and some may find this frustrating. Secondly, amongst the police it is very easy for one player to dominate the others to the point where their involvement is negligible. Third, jack can have a really long wait in between turns while the police figure out what to do. Lastly, if you want to win as police you are going to need to take pretty good notes and spend some time reviewing them. None of the above bothers me and this is a new favourite at the time of these comments (7/9/14)

First time playing it and it took until the 3rd round to fully engage with it.  First round the 'run after Jack' approach generated clues, 2nd round 'block Jack in' approach bombed and 3rd round 'a bit of both' seemed to work well.  For the bits where no clues could be found, you are in danger of getting demotivated.  Maybe 'sacrifice a copper' option for a few clues could work to tweak the game and keep the flow?  Either way it's really good and worth playing but tweaking it will probably be required.

RATING: 7
Tense, exciting two-player game -- but no doubt flawed. The more you play the more you want to solve the puzzle (win the game) and consequently the more choices become over analyzed. Possibly the game is too much in Jack's favor.

Unique setting, clean mechanics, and fun gameplay greatly help make up for the fact that the game is slightly unfair.

I read the rules for this game, and I really wanted to play it, I really did.

BUT.  I just couldn't stomach the rules for the game.  I have played Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper, and the Mr. Jack games with no problems.

But those games didn't have me (as the hidden movement player) trying to go to the scene, commit a crime, and flee while trying to remain unnoticed.

Mr. Jack had me fleeing the scene.  Okay.
Mystery Rummy had me playing evidence to pinpoint who Jack the ripper is.  Okay.

This one went to far for me, and I couldn't play it.

Halfway between Scotland Yard and The Fury of Dracula, with no dice rolls or cards in the middle to steal victory from a worthy player or a worthy team.

Proud to have been developer and playtester of this great game (yes, I am biased).

I am forced to lower my rating by one point, since the final published board is different from the "perfect" one we playtested... now the game is slighlty umbalanced towards Jacl, so I would suggest players to penalize jack through some of the options provided in the rulebook

This is a really cool game group vs. one deduction game, basically a stripped down, streamlined version of Fury of Dracula. There's no combat mechanic, just a pure chase. There's a couple of problems with this: the hunt can become a little tedious, especially for Jack, and the game can feel repetitive if you play it too often. However, the rules are extremely easy to learn, the set-up is simple, and the game is just beautiful. With two players or a group of experienced players, it doesn't feel overly long (however, groups can be prone to lots of talking and can stretch the length a little, but I think a game which gets people talking is a good thing if you don't mind a longer game). It can be VERY intense at times and has a great edge-of-your-seat appeal towards the final turns. It's definitely a thinker, though, so you'll be taking lots of notes. It always leaves me feeling intellectually satisfied.

Letters from Whitechapel is essentially a master's version of Scotland Yard.  The police get less information to work with, and what they do receive comes less often.

Very fun strategy game of deduction in the same mould as one of my favourite games, Fury of Dracula.  Whereas FoD is mostly a chase game with plenty of chrome and wild swings of luck, this is a pure chase game with no luck whatsoever.

I was wondering if it would feel too abstract since it's so streamlined.  Not at all.  This game is highly thematic, and reminded me very much of a scene in a movie in which the cops are poring over a pin-map, trying to find the pattern that will lead to capture.

I also think this would be a far better choice if you only have 2 players.  FoD has too much stuff to administer.

UPDATE: I think I may prefer this to FoD...

I thoroughly enjoyed my first game, as did the other players involved. The gameplay is asymmetric and deduction-driven. I can understand how the theme can put some people off. I'd like to play it again. The rules are fairly easy to get after the first game.

While I tend not rate games after just one play, I'm pretty sure I have an opinion that's sure enough about this one to rate it. It may change though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game seems completely broken in favor of Jack if you play with the rules as written. If Jack's hideout is next to or within two spaces of one of the wretched, then on rounds three and four he can just kill and go straight home before the police have a chance to act.

Still, if Jack doesn't use that strategy (and possibly with the help of some houserules) this is a better version of Scotland Yard. In this game the detectives can ask for clues about where Jack has traveled, and they win by attempting to arrest Jack at his current spot. This is a little more interesting than Scotland Yard where you just try to land on the same space as Mister X.

This is a terrific game. A friend of mine has a copy and after playing it once I just had to have a copy of my own. I've played it with 3-4 players so far and I can see why it'd be best as a 2 player game. Playing one policeman is a bit boring because there's little for a single policeman to do. You move and either gather clues or try for an arrest. That's it. If playing all 5 policemen then you make all the decisions. You either win or lose by your own deductive reasoning and the police aren't being divided up unevenly between players if played with fewer than the maximum of 6.
The rules are generally well written. The artwork and materials are of good quality although there are some intersections on the board that have black policemen squares questionably placed. Also, with just 5 policemen it's terribly difficult for them if they can't locate Jack's hideout. But then Jack never was caught so thematically making it balanced in Jack's favour makes the game wonderfully challenging.
Overall it's a simple yet addictive game of cat and mouse. I give it an 8.

It seems perfectly fine for a Scotland-Yard-esque deduction type game, but of course has the problem of really being a 2-player game in spite of not being advertised as such.  As always, I have at most mediocre enthusiasm for any game where I feel the central mechanism is better solved by a computer than by myself.

Many versus 1, with hidden movement. Take on the role of the police as you attempt to track down and locate Jack the Ripper before he finds his next victim. Lovely theme and map of the 1800s London.

Feels best with 2.

Letters from Whitechapel is a fantastically evocative game of true deduction and pursuit. The mechanics of the game are minimal and simple, which leave for a true player vs. player feel. The absence of random draws and event cards allows for the players to feel that they are playing one another and not having the challenge artificially "enhanced" by the game itself. It's dark themes are not overstated in the components, but the mood set by the play still may draw them out too much for some players, making this game an uneasy fit for most families or many new gamers. However, if you are not put off by the theme, this truly is a masterpiece.

Pretty cool game. This is NOT a reworking of Scottland Yard or Fury of Dracula. That'd be like saying all deck building games are reworkings of Dominion because it was the first. No this is a game that uses the system and makes a game all it's own. Much like Garibaldi before this one was it's own game. This game was a lot of fun.

UPDATE as suspected this is best as a 2 player game. First outing was a full 6 but now with a 2 player game down this is where the game shines.

RATING: 6.5
[thing=59959][/thing] is a game much easier to learn than I expected. Basically Jack kills a victim and then has 15 turns to reach his refuge. The policeman need to find Jack's tracks and either arrest him or prevent him from reaching his hiding place. Jack moves through the numbered spots in the board, while the policemen move up to two spots by the square spots, and once they all did their movements, they can ask, one at a time, for the Jack player if he passed by any of the number connected to the squares spots the policeman are at. If Jack did, it ends the turn of the policeman asking (so, if this happen in a place with three numbered spots connected, and Jack passed by the first place the policeman asked, the policeman player can't ask more about the other places), and it is put a yellow marker in the number to show that Jack passed there. So, using the yellow markers, the policemen try to judge the path of Jack, considering the distance he moved, and where he can be.

Jack has some tricks to use: first, he can backtrack; also, he has two things that help his movement: carriages (move twice in a turn) and lanterns (cross a block - meaning that Jack doesn't need to follow the path in the board, but can "jump" from a number to other, but this one must be connected to the same block). Also, in the set up of the round, Jack position the markers for the possible victims, and the police don't know which is "true" and which is "false" - but also the chief of police (one elected player) position the police in such a way that it also has some "false" policeman, but Jack can check these markers to see if they are or aren't false by delaying the kill, and is able to look at one marker per turn he delays, however the police can then move the victims markers closer to the policemen, which might make the fleeing after the assassination harder. This all could be seem as a difficult task for the policemen and that Jack has the upperhand, but the experiences with the game show something else: that Jack usually is caught somewhat easily.

The Jack player only wins if he avoids the police for four rounds, killing and returning to his refuge all the times. The police have four rounds to find his hideout and prevent him from reaching this place, or arrest him while he is on the move.

I considered [thing=59959][/thing] harder for Jack than for the police - but we did play with one rule wrong: after the movement of a cop, the player already asked about the position of Jack, so the next cop could take this into consideration and plan his movement accordingly, and this made the game for Jack much harder. Even with this, if if I compare it with its sibling, [thing=20963][/thing], in which Dracula has a lot of resources, not only to stay hidden, but also many servants, powers and events, while Jack basically only has one advantage: he can backtrack, and this can throw the police off. The carriage is akin to Dracula's wolf form and bat form; and Jack's lantern reminds me of the sea travel, as Dracula can reach several places without following a given path.

Now, for those that don't like the luck factor present in [thing=20963][/thing] (sometimes in the movement; mostly there in the combat; and also in the events and encounters), but really enjoy the "hunt", [thing=59959][/thing] is the answer to your wishes. There is no luck here besides that which comes from the unpredictability of the humans beings - every now and then the most logic course of action would be do X, but the player will do Y, which appear of nowhere and make almost no sense, and will hit gold. In [thing=59959][/thing] there aren't events nor dice. Jack's movement and those of the policemen are always chosen by the players, inside their limitations.

However, it is hard to ponder about any unbalance in the game, because even when Jack is caught early, usually he is a few steps away to leaving the grasp of the police - it is usually a matter of a lucky move, or one turn more (** and more plays later showed that, with all the proper rules, Jack can be tough to be found, and Jack had two straight wins, the second a really easy one **). So I can see that the dispute can be a head to head knife fight, but, until now, such a play didn't happened - which is probably due to Jack's player requiring more savyy and being a more difficult to play than that of Dracula in [thing=20963][/thing], therefore experience on his side have even more weight.

The game bits are nice, thematic and the overall graphic design is pretty great.

I really liked this game a lot, especially for two.  My husband liked it, but would rather play any of a number of other games we have on the shelf.  My gaming group hated it because of the competing alphas and the police turn into the Keystone Cops when there are too many cooks in the kitchen.

It's pretty interesting, although I definitely think it's more fun to play as Jack.  The deduction that goes into finding Jack's hideout is very difficult, and can definitely be frustrating at times.  The theme isn't exactly PG either...I wish it wasn't based on such horrific events.

Really enjoyed playing this. Basically a game of hide and seek with a simple and fast ruleset. The game seems that it could have been about anything so it's a shame they chose the rather unpleasant jack the ripper theme. Anyway, it's fun despite the subject matter but might be best at 2-players as adding more players slows the game down and doesn't seem to add anything interesting to the gameplay.

Only one play. My favourite of this "type" so far. That is, I far prefer it to Scotland Yard. Fury of Dracula could possibly be seen to be of this "type", but I rather think it has too much else in it to be as simple as this one. I have seen comments about it containing too much gore and other "questionable content", but I like the look of the board, despite the red ink (er, blood, apparently). In my mind, calling the murder victim pawns "the wretched", instead of another, more obvious, moniker, shows that there was some restraint.

Get ready to enter into the poor and dreary Whitechapel district in the London 1888, the scenario of the mysterious Jack The Ripper murders, with its crowded and smelly alleys, hawkers, shouting merchants, dirty children covered in rags who run through the crowd and beg for money, and prostitutes - called "the wretched" -- on every street corner. The board game Letters from Whitechapel will take the players right there: one player plays Jack the Ripper, and his goal is to take five victims before being caught. The rest of the players - 1 to 5 - are police detectives, who must cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game.

Whitechapel provides great tension as players trace the location of Jack the Ripper, and provides a sense of accomplishment that few other games manage to achieve. However, as much as I love this game, it suffers from long downtime, requires a good Jack the Ripper player, and can suffer from an alpha gamer, all three which can be huge problems that take the fun out of the game. In general, I wouldn't play this with any more than 3 players, with 2 being the ideal number of players.

This is a great game. Playing Jack is an amazing and thrilling experience, and requires great planning and bluffing in order to win. My favorite games are the ones that allow a player to feel like they truly deserved their victory, and Whitechapel delivers in this regard. Whether I am playing the detectives or Jack, I am captivated for the entire game and love every minute of it. Although it is not the deepest game, no other game can deliver the same thrill as Whitechapel. I am constantly thinking about the game, and can't ever see myself passing up an opportunity to play. I can't recommend this one highly enough.

Any game can trigger an emotional response (even if it is boredom), but this is one of the few games that has ever triggered a physiological response in me.  The first time I played Jack I had a racing heart and sweaty palms as the Police cordon closed in, followed by elation as I was able to slip through and make it to the safety of my lodgings.  Playing as one of the Investigators is a totally different, but no less fun, experience.  For me this is a great game to demonstrate what modern board gaming offers over more traditional titles.

Showed up in our group.  Finally got a peek at a game like this, which will likely knock Fury of Dracula out of the running.

Laurie's thinking she wants this.  It's different enough from our other games and will handle six so I think it's a likely candidate.

We bought it the day Nexus went under.

Moved up to an eight after our Rivers of Red theme day.  The game is just fun and a nail biter for Jack.

An amazingly clever game.  I can't imagine hidden movement getting much better than this, or deduction for that matter.  Really amazing theme and production with all of the historical embellishments.  Very tense, very fun!

Biggest draw back is really just in how long the game is, and having the right group for it.  3 is the magic number for having tabletalk without leaving people out, so you have to have just a few other people who are willing to invest themselves in the cat and mouse logic deduction puzzle.

The best deduction game. It's not even close. I've heard the complaint that it's dry, but whereas Fury of Dracula has a great theme and components, Letters is the better experience and design. As Jack, the player toys with the investigators when it suits their strategy and flat out evades them when needed for survival. The game can be anywhere from 40 minutes to 3 hours (depending on the amount of deliberation and how clever/quick Jack is or is not). Complaints of balance are best addressed by adding optional rules from the book as needed. I play with two very different groups. Group A are investigators that track every guess and clue, so they prefer scaling back area clues (limited to lead investigator each evening) and catch an experienced Jack 50% of the time. Group B allows area clues for all investigators and assigns Jack a random hideout. Jack escapes more than 50% of games. I think that balance will depend on the group.

1.5 hours for us to figure out the rules then another 4 hours of gameplay (and this is a group of players that don't have analysis paralysis). Some mechanics improved over Scotland Yard, but in the end, these mechanics are not good enough to warrant all the extra time they add to the game.

Could be better with more plays, but I'm not wasting the time finding out.

The best deduction/chase game hands down, and one of my favorite games period.  The 3+ hours it takes feels like just one as players are constantly on the edge of their seats. Playing Jack and the investigators are two completely different experiences, which makes it almost like two different games. 

Our investigators use laminated maps and dry erase markers for assistance. For those seeking an intense battle of nerves and wits, and who enjoy both deduction and spatial games, you should be in heaven.

I use the following variants:

a) Investigators may move a third space in lieu of searching for clues or making an arrest, what is now officially known as the "rushing" variant.

b) If Jack walks home on the first move of night 4, Investigators get to take their turn.

c) Jack's hideout is random.

You need good people to play this with as everyone should be engaged. If you've got that, it gets really exciting. First time I played it I felt defeated the entire time because we just couldn't catch a break on clues. But then once we caught the trail we were able to corner him and take him down! And apparently we were very close a few other times which made him sweat but he did well at hiding it.

Not enough flare in this game imo. It's mostly a cat and mouse game of chance. A huge numbered board and over the course of 4 nights (rounds) you try to determine where the 1 player that controls jack the ripper is hiding out at. Could get boring for the 1 player as you could have up to 5 other players deliberating on where to go and what to do for a lengthy amount of time. But you basically do the same thing each round so gets a little repetitious.

Pure deduction. Deep, engaging, very thematic. This game is fantastic as a 2 player game. My wife loves it and that makes it a real winner for me. Now to try Fury of Dracula with her...

Pure hidden movement game. Doesn't do too much differently than other games like it and the board, while thematic feeling, is very bland to look at.

RATING: 6.855
Hidden Movement game dripping with theme drawn from the Jack the Ripper Crimes.  Possibly too gruesome a theme for some but good for those with a love of the macabre.  Possibly best played as a two-player game but can be played in a 'team Vs Jack' style.

RATING: 10
Wow, did I have fun playing this game!!  Why did I wait so long after getting it to play it?  Because it seemed too complicated.  Luckily I have some great gamer friends, and we all watched a "how to play" video together and got down to it.  Really not that difficult at all.  The first night took a very long; I was playing Jack and I almost got caught after my 3rd move, but was able to evade.  I then almost got caught twice more.  It took me all 15 turns to get back to home base for night one.  Night two went much quicker as  the murder was close to home.  The detectives were sure they knew where my base was, but they were so wrong and Night three was easy and four went just as quickly.  So much pressure in night one that the rest seemed like a breeze.  I sure enjoyed playing as Jack; will see how I feel as a detective.

It's likely that my rating is more based on my personal game preferences. I don't really care for the hidden move/guessing/deductive games. (Scotland Yard, Fury of Dracula, Letters from Whitechapel) 

It's compounded by the fact that I don't care for all versus one games, mainly because it sucks to be the one. I'd much rather play a FFA, 2v3 or 3v3 type of game. It wasn't a bad or broken game per se, just not something I enjoy.

Not sure what the hoopla is about.  Playing [i]Whitechapel[/i] is like being forced to squirm through four straight games of Scotland Yard, which itself is only modestly entertaining.

I'd never want to play a full game of LfW.  For me, two rounds is more than enough.  There's only one thing to do on your hunter turn, and that's move and clue-hunt.  Do that 500 times, and you'll have some idea as to the one-dimensionality of the whole affair.

And if you play Jack, be prepared to say "no" a lot.  

[i]Hunters: Are you at 65?

Jack: No.

Hunters: 72?

Jack: No.

Hunters: 75?

Jack: Wait...maybe...let me check.  OK, still no.[/i]

While I like Mr. Jack quite a lot the fact that it is only two player prevents it from getting played more often.  This might be just what the doctor ordered?  I've read good things from people in my gaming group.  I hope one of them gets a copy so I can "try before you buy."

RATING: 7
Excellent hidden movement game, but unfortunately I find it to be far more enjoyable playing as Jack the Ripper than I do playing as the police.  Playing as Jack you get to listen to the police talk out their crazy theories. Playing as the police you get to look at the giant smirk on Jack's face while you struggle to find a clue.  Basically, Jack is more fun, the police are more challenging.

RATING: 7.25
Played it once now with two. 
I played the detectives and won :) I bet being the killer is more exciting. As detectives it sadly didn't feel i was really investigating, because it's really nothing more then hide and seek. Still fun and at times exciting, but not as epic as i hoped it would be. (yet)

It took me more time figuring out this game then it should, because basically, the rules are very simple and could even be done on 2 A4 pages. But they don't start with 3 lines of explanation of the game saying just: "follow these chapters", but instead show a confusing setup page (which isn't a game setup but a game overview) followed by the chapters without any reference to the summary cards or when to play it. Anyway, not a big thing, but could easily be fixed.

Review after initial play as Jack.  I like the suspense being Jack as the rest of the cops are talking through all the possibilities where you should be.  

I worry about replayability on this one though.  It seems that there won't be a lot of variation from game to game.

This game is much much better than Scotland Yard (similar mechanic).  However it can run very very long.  One game with 4 players took almost 4 hours.  I think as the game is played more it will speed up, but it's going to be a long game regardless...

Not one I'm really willing to try again. I felt the game was too much in the favor of Jack, unless the detectives are willing to overanalyze EVERYTHING, which would drag out the game into infinity. Took more than 3 hours with 6 players: too long. It's a shame, I wanted to like this game, but it's not for me, unfortunately...

First time we played, Jack lost pretty early in the game. The second time another player of my group totally fooled us and was able to get away. It's a good hidden movement game and depending on Jack can be so hard for the detectives to figure out where he went, but that also makes the game very long sometimes. If the detectives or Jack have to think about their turns for too long it can get boring for the "opponent". Although as Jack I always think about future turns during the detectives turns. I sometimes have a bit problems with the mini map, because you still have to check where the detectives are on the map, and you don't want to give away too much with where you're looking at.
In the end I really enjoy the game even if it drags on at times. My game group likes it too, so we play it occasionally.

This is a solid contribution to the "find the hidden moving guy" genre.  At first glance it seems like it is weighted toward Jack winning more often then not, but clever investigators who get hot on the trail can make it impossible for him to get home or even catch him in the open!  I'm not sure how well it scales though. Once you have an investigator with only one pawn there is a good chance they may get left out of the hunt for most of the game.

My wife hates playing the police role and I find playing Jack to be too stressful so this works out out perfectly for us. It's very thematic and the game play can be really tense. Given the broad similarity from game to game, it's not something I can play often, but it's good to break out when a different type of game is needed.

RATING: 5.5
Unique, engaging play with plenty of room for strategy, rich theme and well balanced asymmetrical gameplay.

As investigators plays like an interesting puzzle, as jack a tense chase.

Traded away because it turned out to be too mathsy. The investigators are best played by being very calculating and deliberate, it becomes almost like a sudoku or some kind of puzzle than a game.

RATING: 7
Just one play, a long evening at a friend's place. Took us about 3 hours, I was Jack. I must say, I can't remember almost anything of what happened during that much time.
I was sweating, I was thinking... for three hours that felt like a minute and during the final two longest player moves of my life, was I really Jack the Ripper?

Can't tell, honestly. This game made me go back to board games... actually it made me discover them, seriously. Just one game with it, so I can't really give a 10 here as it wouldn't be fair (it needs more plays), but boy, it was the most intense game I had that I can remember!

Update (Aug 2012): after repeated plays, I'm starting to see the reasons behind the complaints about LfW. It's true, everything is totally engaging on Jack's side, but on the investigator team things differ quite strongly depending on who is playing. This may result in better or worse experiences, but ultimately is more a flaw in the semi-coop genre than a fault of the game itself.
I'm decreasing the score down to 8 also because I feel this is a game that doesn't benefit from frequent plays, as it feels a bit "seamy", especially for the investigators.

Update (Dec 2012): impressive fall from grace! Due to the continuous request of this game in my group, I'm starting to heavily dislike it. It's still a solid offering in the genre, but it will now need a good amount of "rest" before my desire to play it again recovers.

Unas reglas sencillas y sublimes que hacen que los calores, nervios y la excitación se manifiesten en todos los participantes. 

Jack vuelve a casa con las manos manchadas de sangre haciendo repiquetear con orgullo sus pasos en la noche londinense. El acoso y el debate que los policías tejen a cada paso que da el asesino no tiene precio. 

Los inspectores se abalanzan frustrados confundiendo al criminal con los transeúntes, tratando de adivinar su paradero a toda velocidad. Cuando Jack llegue a su guarida  estará a salvo. Londres no. Cuatro noches. Cinco asesinatos en sus calles.

Un juego que no deja de salir a mesa.

A pure battle of wits. The ultimate deduction game. LfW takes the best bits of The Fury of Dracula, strips it to an almost skeletal framework which still remains pumped full of atmosphere.

Tenser than Garibaldi, and craftier than Scotland Yard.

I could see how this might be fun if you're Jack the Ripper, but as a cop, this was a total snoozefest. I've never felt so disinterested in a game. The play time is way too long for what it is. I'd rather play pretty much anything else.

Specifics, as a cop, your job is to poke around mindlessly until you find out where Jack was several turns ago. It takes several full rounds to get an educated guess at where Jack's hideout is, which could be at least an hour. I'll admit that once we were pretty sure we knew where Jack's hideout was, we could more easily discern his movement path because he had to hang around it, the game got a little more interesting, but before that point, I just wanted my character to help Jack kill his victims so the game would end faster.

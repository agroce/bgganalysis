Not too different from Uruk, better illustrations and components though. A very nice compact game. I dislike the fact that they made a larger box - old Uruk could fit in a large pocket.

Fallowing rhados suggestion on using less level 2 cards for a 2 player game (We used 12 in total) the game gets much more fun and about the right length. I suggest print and play the black promo cards until they are available.

Uruk II vs Uruk I... Uruk II drops the rule for needing exact copies of a card to build that card and instead allows you to build it with cards of the same color (making it MUCH easier to build what you want and play strategically).  Also, Uruk II is more balanced, measured, and controlled, while Uruk I is very tactical, kind of chaotic, seat-of-your pants type of game.  For a more detailed comparison, check out the beginning and conclusion of the 11/26/2014 review called "So which is better?..." by BGGer duckworp.

So awful, that I had to ask everyone to quit on our first, and only play.

Random god cards that are completely broken.
The game bogs down in the 3rd and 4th epoch as you're just trying  to get pairs of resources.

Not a game that fits in any criteria that would call for it to be ever played.

Compared to the original, the early game ramps up much faster. I like many of the changes, especially planning for the disasters. There's not enough differences to upgrade my copy.

I was expecting this to be a lot better than it is. The iconography is obtuse and the gameplay isn't terribly exciting. It might improve at 4 players, but at 2 it was a dud.

I just don't know what to do about this game.

I'm a big fan of the original Uruk with 20 plays. I even acquired an Artscow version of Uruk in English.  A complaint I've always had with it is that the rules are hard to convey, and I constantly find myself referring to the rulebook.

So when you thought Uruk II came out with streamlined rules and improved bits I'd love it, right?  Well, I'm just not sure.  Some of the tension has been removed with the rules simplification, so I may create a hybrid version that brings back some of the things I liked about Uruk.

My thoughts.

We just played today a two player game. Things didn't go very fast. First 3 cards on the display were not good at all (for us) and we only took cards from the draw pile almost until the end (I wish they had an option to refill the cards and then choose one). 

Some of the game was just gathering resources turns with nothing else to do. Decitions did not seem to be very important. Combos were not that gamechanging, just minor improvements, it seemed it did not really matter what you built. 

It was a learning game, of course, and it took some time to see what deities implied, and what age turns implied. The game got faster and more fun at the end and finally I won with less settlements than the other player.

My thoughts are that this is not a very thinky game, nor should it take a long time to do your actions. Some speed is needed by the players if you do not want the first part of the game to be boring. I am looking forward to playing another game now that I know how it works, without stopping to check the cards over and over (specially deities and civilization cards).

Sorry if my opinion is only that I need to play more to have an opinion, but I hope it helps someone. It is a shame this game is not getting any more comments.

A game that does everything well but nothing great. I like many parts of it and it works well, but still nothing I get excited about playing. I prefer this to the original Uruk as it feels more balanced and more streamlined as well.

RATING: N/A
[b][FirstImpressionOn3rdNOV2014][/b] Uruk II is a much more streamlined version of Uruk I. I liked it better only because I now have a proper edition of the game (my Uruk I was a PnP). 

My first game was a 2-player game. My opponent commented that the game felt repetitive for him. I feel there was a moderate sense of repetitiveness but it wasn't excessive.

The new additions of end-of-epoch disaster and pre-requisite of constructing a settlement are a plus. Good thing that they included extra cards to ensure that every game is different. One thing I missed from Uruk I was the cool bidding when diety was drawn. 

I like that they've decided to ditch the text based abilities and turn everything into symbols instead. They're hard to grasp in the first few turns, but they become second nature after that. The components upgrade is great, much better than just cubes used in Uruk I. They've included enough player aids and summary sheets for both English and German and everything fits just nice in the small box. 

I felt that the way that diety and end-of-epoch disaster are resolved is a bit clunky. In Uruk I, you resolve this at the end of a player's turn while in Uruk II, you interrupt the player's turn to resolve it, and then play resume normally.

Tracking your actions can be a bit calculative and hard to remember, so I'll introduce the use of glass beads.

The original Uruk is one of my favourite games but it has sadly been out of print for many years.  Uruk II, whilst broadly similar in design, is very different in play from Uruk 1.  If interested I wrote a comparison [thread=1275805] here [/thread].
 
Uruk II is a fine civ card game and it packs a good deal of civ-building into its 45 minutes.  It plays smoothly, a lot more so than the original,  and the opportunities to develop a slowly evolving strategy are there from the start.  The luck of the cards can largely be mitigated through the long-term planning available within the game mechanics, which was not the case on Uruk 1.
I still prefer the original, but then I prefer my games wilder and more chaotic which Uruk 1 certainly was.  But I would say that Uruk 2 is more marketable and easier to learn and to play in a balanced fashion.  If you have never played Uruk, now is your chance.  It packs a lot of depth into a short amount of time.

Excellent player aids included - one of the best in terms of both quality and quantity.
(Seems to take too much time to work through the level 2 cards so we reduced the number that are included.  One game was completed before we even got to level 3/4 cards, which makes the game less interesting.  This is especially the case in a 2 player game -- which otherwise plays well with 2.)

Update:  Saw that other reviewers also removed some of the level 2 cards.

Usually I like many games where others claim it i sjust 'multiplayer-solitair'. But with this game I always asked myself where any interaction is. In addition it has some major elements of luck - with no kind of interaction there is some feeling that the winner is the one with the biggest luck.

Yay, the new version finally got released. I would have to play both version back to back, but there are already a few things in the new edition that make the game more interesting.

Having different disaster cards makes this game much better. Same is true for the rules.

Even after many years, still a nice little game.

Good game - medium weight end of evening type, although I wonder whether your best play is usually obvious given the card choices that you have. A modicum of planning helps to avoid disasters and rules tweaks that affect building during epoch changes. Some differences from the first edition but very similar experience overall.

If you're coming into Uruk II thinking you're playing a civ-lite game, you'll be disappointed. The civ elements of the game are abstracted to the point where you can pretend that pretty much anything is going on. It's a sort of tableau-builder except you only have five cards in your tableau which you're theoretically gradually improving. 

Uruk II isn't awful, but it has a weird sense that the game dislikes its own rules. There are costs to laying down cards, but one of the first techs you can get lowers them. A more striking example: in the game we played, at one point a civ card required our tableaus to be worth at least 13 points in order to buy a settlement. Fine, no problem, we're supposed to be raising the values of our civs anyway. Then the next civ card threatened a grave penalty if the value got above 15. Why? Why penalize the players for not only doing something you just rewarded, but which the victory condition of the game is built around?

The main issue with Uruk II is that it's an unremarkable entry into a crowded field. With so many options for tableau-building games, including civ-like ones (I'm looking at you, Imperial Settlers) there's just no reason to roll with this one.

This is a card-based, medium-weight civ builder. It actually played faster than I was expecting and it felt quite different from other games. In spite of being a card-based game, it didn't feel like it was all about getting some perfect combos, and more about timing purchases right.

Great medium weight game, once you learned the iconography. There is some luck involved (drawing cards), but as there are multiple copies of each card, that's not too bad. 

Components' quality is good; there is some splintering of cutting edges with the resource pieces, but that's not a problem.

Well, it had some good stuff to it, just not the rulebook which was really terrible.  I mean, who puts the setup in a different paper foldout.  And the card descriptions on another foldout.  We got the rules crapped, but got it figured out around the end.  The game runs pretty simple once you get foing.

Somewhat weird production choices with a million different pieces of paper included but the gameplay has been very nicely streamlined. Clearly the best improvements are disasters being known in advance, and that payments are made by cards of the same color instead of identical cards like before.

Poco immediato il gioco, che necessita comunque di pianificazione e valutazione, non scorre liscio. E' un solitario di gruppo dove la massima interazione sta nel rubarsi le carte. Molto casuale appunto per l'uscita delle carte e un po' laborioso nella valutazione degli score. Troppe regolette per un giochino che avrei apprezzato di più se con durata inferiore.

"Re-implementation of Uruk, which I loved. This is far easier to teach, and has far nicer components. I love the small box. II is definitely more lenient in play, which some will like, and others won't. It plays a LOT differently from the original, so I'm having to unlearn and relearn strategies. "

What I like:
- Keeps the flavor of Uruk, but streamlined
- Pretty easy to teach
- New epoch/disaster system is awesome
- Civ theme is very thin, but better than nothing
- The box is small and cute; wooden bits are very nice
- Plays briskly (2p learning games have taken 60 minutes)
- Supports 5p (although I haven't tried at that count)
- The documentation is quite good, especially the setup guide

What I don't like:
- It is almost too easy to build achievements now
- As a vegetarian, I would have preferred wheat, grapes, or figs, rather than pigs. 
- The game still seems to reward a resources engine to build settlements fast; a card-based engine is difficult

Most of the changes from Uruk to Uruk II are big improvements. The lovely shaped bits instead of cubes are much nicer, of course, and the epochs/disaster system is elegant and adds nice variability. This version is vastly easier to teach, with the cards having English text and simpler icons, no auctions for disasters, simpler "actions" vs. "non-actions", etc. 

I'm not yet sure how I feel about achievements being so much easier to build now. It definitely makes it easier to play the cards you want, rather than what you happened to draw. However, for me, all the advantages of the new game means it replaces the old one, even if I end up deciding that I slightly prefer the older gameplay. 

I think the weight is probably slightly heavier than the BGG-voted 2.6. I'll say 2.7.

Anyone play test anything anymore? A grab for resources. Everyone doing exactly the same thing one turn behind each other. Rinse repeat over and over. Wait for disasters to slow everything to a grinding halt just because they can. Then wait for random god cards to come out and hand victory points to players at random. Wow great. Why are we playing again? How these games pass play test and muster I don't know. Guess it's enough to print it these days and the masses will buy it up

A 'streamlined' version of the already great "Uruk : Wiege der Zivilisation" with some additional tweaks.

Clearer iconography, a variation in the actions, plus a change in the gods/disaster execution. Fancier wooden bits & slightly bigger box.

Still packs a great game into a small box. Not sure I need to own it as I have the original, but having the English rules included & English/German text on the cards will hopefully get it some more exposure which it richly deserves.

RATING: 6
Simple enough. Good options on your turn - build settlements for cheap early on, go for a balance or build up your civilisation from the start with the plan of getting some big points earning cities by the end. Forward planning changes from game to game with the different Epoch cards and there's some surprises with the order of the Deity cards. There's some timing considerations and enough flexibility with building costs that you can normally force a path you're straying off if you're determined not to be flexible.

Nice cards, artwork, better (and more) wooden bits than the original. The symbols need some getting used to - so it goes with multilingual games. DDD has put some love into this one and the production quality is top notch. It's not exciting as such - there's no attacking your opponents or particular tension in the game. There is however a rewarding feeling of pulling together a plan over several turns. I like and it may rise in the ratings with more play. As is it's a solid mid weight card game that plays well with 2-4 players (can't comment on how it goes with five just yet).

This is a light, tableau-building civ-themed game. Unfortunately, it just seemed a bit bland. And the rules are just terrible, scattered through the book and paper foldouts! I'd rather play Guns & Steel!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The cards show several different advances, in 5(?) different colors. You start with a single level 1 tech on the table (with one structure token = settlement), and a hand of level 2s. The deck has more 2s on top, then 3s and 4s shuffled together (along with god cards). You get several (3?) actions on your turn: draw a card, play a card, or activate a card (which gives you resources, draw cards, exchange items, etc.). Playing = adding to your tableau (max 5 cards): to pay for it, must discard a number cards of same color = cost-1. In additon, some cards give you powers/abilities without requiring activation. Finally, you can acquire tokens to build another settlement or upgrade a settlment to a city. As tokens are acquired, the game advances through the eras (token prices increase each era; game ends after 5 eras). Switching between eras, players usually have to spend some resources to avoid some penalty; they also get some resources. The god cards trigger a variety of one-time events.

At the end of the game, score VP for the cards in your display = card level x (1 if settlemnt, 2 if city). Some cards give you additional points, too. Most VP wins.

One of my favorite Civ cards games. It's one of those ones where you can miss the theme unless you think about it (like Innovation). So good and fun, and you really get a sense of building. Does a nice job with resource management, crisis management, and variable replayability.

Card driven human progress civ game from stone age to antiquity. Develop your civilization by draft and putting achievement cards in play by paying card and resource cost. Successive ages provide greater advancements and free actions to build combos.  Also a race to build settlements over the achievement cards and convert to cities which become more costly. Later ages introduce dieties for another point path. Random natural events mark the beginning of the next age. This is a stream lined re-make of its namesake. Plays smooth and would be a good intro to this genre.

RATING: 9
My favorite CCG; I enjoyed it a lot. Steep learning curve for a CGG, but all of the expansions and rules and card effects go together very well; it all fits together very nicely.  The cards also have a lot of nice detailed (often humorous) info on them for Star Wars fans. In the early days of the game, main characters were too hard to get for how good they were, and many of the interrupts relied on the main characters to work to their full effect. Fortunately, this dependency on rare main characters has been lessened with each expansion, as more great, unique, easier to get characters were released and eventually (with enhanced premiere and DSII packs) good versions of the main characters were included in starter packs or were otherwise easily obtainable. And now, most of the mains and rares are available for cheap online.

I own a bunch of cards, mostly from Premiere, ranging all the way up to DSII (including a full set of premiere cards). The last things I bought were probably the DS2 preconstructed decks.

Since I'm probably the only person in my circle of friends who owns this CCG, I have some themed decks that I try to make relatively balanced that can be fun to play against each other.

[u]My thoughts on the various sets released:[/u]
Best expansion? Special Edition, IMO. It was full of cool stuff from all three movies, and this expansion really changed the feel of the game by adding objective cards and a slew of other stuff to help you get your deck to do what you want it to. 

Another favorite? Reflections. This wasn't so much a new expansion as it was a mix of all the old expansions. If you were out of the game for a little while and then came back, this was perfect for you. It had 18(!) cards per pack, way more than other sets' boosters for the same price.

Another good expansion? Hoth. It added another planet (the game only had Tatooine and the Death Star before that), along with cool combat vehicles (AT-ATs, AT-STs, and snowspeeders) for both sides. Some of the new unique characters were quite good in any setting (not just on Hoth).

Another good one? Third Anthology. Not really an expansion, I guess, but it was a box of various boosters and starters, with an up to date rulebook and glossary for the game (which included errata for cards that had been slightly changed). It also had some great promo cards, including R2 in Red 5 and some objectives that actually made the epic events in A New Hope usable.

OK expansions?
A New Hope: the first expansion. Added more cards to the mix, including the Death Star and Ghhhk/Houjix (a great interrupt), but I feel like it favored the LS over the DS with all the new Rebel pilots and matching ships. Maybe this was a good thing, as I feel that the LS was a bit weaker than the DS in Premeire if neither player had the main characters. The epic events were cool in theory, but impossible to use (each one needed a combo of around 10 cards to pull off).

Jabba's Palace: This expansion introduced starting interrupts and a bunch of other "tutors" to the game. With Jabba, the audiance chamber, and all the aliens that have special abilities there, this expansion favored the DS. In fact, if you see a DS deck without an objective, I'd be surprised if it wasn't based around Jabba's Palace.

Endor/DSII: I didn't buy much of these expansions, and this is about where I stopped buying cards, but both of them were released close to each other and were well balanced between the LS and DS, I thought. There was some obvious power creep here, though; a lot of the weapons were just straight-up better than earlier ones (probably because most weapons sucked in earlier blocks). One of the best things to come out here was the preconstructed decks, each one comming with some great cards (like good versions of Han, Chewie, and Ackbar in the LS one, and an AT-AT, some AT-STs, and some decent ships and pilots in the DS one).

Crappy expansions?
Degobah. The worst. After Hoth, I was like, "What the heck is this?" It didn't seem to have any good cards that weren't really rare. It introduced new lame ways to drain your opponent's force without interacting with him in any way (in the form of cards like Asteroid Sanctuary and the Jedi Tests). The DS got the Executor and a bunch of bounty hunters (but no Fett), which was cool, but everything else about this expansion sucked. It was so bad that a lot of people quit the game at about the time this expansion came out.

Cloud City. Nothing special. All sorts of lame rules on capturing people. Cloud sectors. Wonky Sabbac rules that served no real purpose in the game. *yawn*

I'll just throw Tatooine and Couruscant down here. I have some cards from both, though I've never actually played with them. The defensive shields seem like a good idea, but podracing as an effective way to retrieve/drain force, plus all the other episode I stuff, really changes the game. There was some major power creep going on here, too. Maybe I just don't like the idea of episode I cards mingling with the original trilogy cards, but I don't like it. The new "maintenance" cards (e.g. Han, Chewie, and the Falcon) seem way overpowered, too. I do like "Great shot, Kid!", as it makes the "Massassi Base Operations" objective more viable.

Was a fun game when it was in production years ago. Long out of print.

RATING: 3
Interesting mechanics and design (with a weak asymmetry), but terrible collation and development (Decipher's "magic bullet" policy) made the Star Wars CCG an exemplar of the negative qualities of the CCG market. This game is, to me, a prime example of a game where the bottom line was more important than the quality of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I think I might still have my cards for this game somewhere.  I started playing this when I was in school and was sad when it ended.  It will hold a special place in my heart.  The only thing about CCGs or TCGs is that you have to fork over money $$$ to get the best cards.  That is why LCGs intrigue me more now and why I stopped playing games like this and MTG.

Actually not too bad. I created a couple of reasonably balanced decks and ignored the collectable aspect and it works well.
The exceptions can be complicated for new players, and some of the cards make the fatal error or mentioning other specific cards in their descriptions, which is extremely confusing if you don't know what it's talking about.

Was a great CCG in it's day that became too mucked with too many added rules, card types, and card mechanics in an already deep and heavy card game.  Still have a lot of the original base set and expansions through Dagobah for trade or sale.

RATING: 5
This game suffers from some of the problems of the Star Trek CCG, particularly the massive discrepency between power levels based on rarity. This game also involves excessive library manipulation. This was my least favorite of the popular CCGs (Magic, Star Trek, L5R, Battletech, Vampire).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Clunky gameplay with a wealth of useless or stupid cards. Patch cards were printed instead of banning, restricting, or issuing errata on problem cards. Massive, pointless rules bloat. Glut of card types in later expansions. Should be called Star Skirmishes CCG due to inability to set up larger battles. Play WARS TCG instead if you like the basic mechanics but want a more refined game.

Not sure I ever played a game of this through to completion, or properly for that matter.

Not a fan of the attrition system at all.

The concept behind the game was fantastic, the game became bloated and the developer Decipher became more concerned about turning a profit rather than creating an accessible and enjoyable game.  

If this was made as an LCG with the majority of the useless cards removed then I would rate it as a 10.

Bastantes partidas no registradas.

Sin duda este fue el mejor juego de cartas que tuve en mi juventud. Estaba realmente bien hecho y era divertido de jugar (mucho). La parte mala era sin duda que se trataba de un CCG y que no tuvo demasiado tirón en España (apareció en la época de Magic y el otro le comió todo el mercado). 

Las cartas eran bastante bonitas, con fotogramas de las películas de la trilogía original. Llegué a tener a Darth Vader, la princesa Leia y otras muchas cartas raras sin llegar, de lejos, a tener toda la colección pq no manejaba dinero suficiente para ello y la frecuencia de cartas raras (que abarcaban a los personajes principales de las películas y usualmente las más poderosas) era extremadamente pequeña. El timo de los CCG que es ampliamente conocido por todo el mundo a estas alturas.

Acabé vendiendo la mayor parte de las cartas importantes a coleccionistas por un precio más que aceptable. Conservo aún muchas de las cartas comunes e infrecuentes.

Enh.  I prefer games like RFTG and Dominion.  I can see how it would be an engaging hobby, but I'm not interested enough to delve much further into it.  Then again, we were using a starter set, so maybe different cards will provide a better experience.

RATING: 9
I spent a lot of time playing this during my high school years.  The individuals I met through SWCCG introduced me to Twilight Imperium and other excellent games.  If you don't already have a playable collection of these cards, it will probably take a lot of looking and money to collect them.  If you do have some, I hope you have someone around to play it with you.  It's worth it!  If you're interested in this try to round up a pair of Death Star II Starter Decks on eBay or somewhere.

With each other CCG I learn about, I realize more and more how amazing this game's core design is. As far as I've heard this is the only CCG that establishes a "board" as the game plays out. The levels of deck control required of players, the extremely unconstrained deck construction rules, and the counter and dice free game play are things I haven't seen in any other CCGs/LCGs since.

RATING: 5
Another CCG Paper Crack product.  Fans of Star Wars will enjoy this take on a CCG.  Cards depict elements from the original trilogy.  Fans will be surprised to find objects that they likely missed during the films.  Some of the smallest background objects are used as cards.  This gives the game a feeling of trying too hard to make a large number of cards.  The mechanics work, but are not stand-out.  Do not look to relive the feeling of the films in the game though.  [GTI Code: TPSL]

Used to play a lot, but comes down to the player buying the most cards generally able to win. Used to have fun building common decks and frustrating players with mega decks.

Played recntly and ranking increased. Quite an elegant design and smooth systems.

Not likely to ever get this to the table again, so donated to a friend who enjoys it,( Jan 2013)

I wasn't as much as a Star Wars fan as a Star Trek fan, so I managed to kick the habit of collecting the Star Wars CCG quite a bit earlier than I did the Star Trek CCG. Still spent seriously scary amounts of money on this, though. Gameplay was equally horrible, and the cards less shiny.

I freaking love this game. I have pretty much everything I want to build different kinds of decks up through JP/SE. Endor and Death Star II would be nice to have, but they're so expensive!

Bumped down to 8.5 for the length of time it takes to construct a deck now with all of the new rules.

I have the complete set as a collector, but I gave up the game very early in its development as the rules just got too cumbersome to keep track of for casual players.

RATING: 10
Very evocative of the Star Wars universe with dozens upon dozens of strategies to employ.

I got into this game early on, so I had the benefit of learning the incredibly massive volume of rules as they were incrementally added with each expansion. It is easy to see how the game can be daunting or confusing for anyone new (not to mention the OOP status and resulting scarcity of many of the "big" cards).

I've recently taken to building my own cube from the classic trilogy. Tons of fun to draft and play without having to agonize over constructing decks.

Nostalgia!  I haven't played this since 1998!  However, what are the odds of introducing a new player to this game?  About 3,720 to 1.  

Although I have fond memories of playing this game, the real unfortunate thing about CCGs is that a player needs to invest a lot of money and study time in order to obtain and become familiar with the various cards from each expansion.

Expensive, hard to get mains, broken cards, but in the beginning it was a great CCG! Too bad the gameplay died the day the special edition expansion was released... I would have rated the first 4/5 sets a 10, after that it was down hill with this game. I'd no longer play this game but I will rate it a 7 just because of the great memories and my participation in the world championships of 1998.

RATING: 8
An awesome competitive card game based on the Star Wars storyline. Games are tense, as victory requires complete elimination of your opponent's deck (life force) through force drains. Great skill is required to excel, as game rewards deck building, correct tactical play, and even memorization allowing for deck manipulation. Basically I like this card game second only to Middle Earth CCG.

Another game I grew up playing, but I've decided I simply don't enjoy it as much as I used to.  It's all about the meta-gaming now, which is something I despise.  I also hate the "arts and crafts" nature of the new virtual cards.  I'd rather just play a boardgame than go through all that...

***UPDATE****
After experiencing the online version of this game via a nifty program called Holotable, I boosted my score up a whole point from 6 to 7.  

Eliminating the inane amount of cutting and pasting for the Virtual cards, in addition to eliminating the card rarity scheme makes this game vastly more enjoyable.

You have the entire current pool of cards at your disposal, and you can make a tweak to your deck and be playing with it two seconds later, without having to find cards, re-sleeve, cut out new Virtual cards, or anything like that.

Quite simply, it removes all the miserable details about deck creation and makes the game fun to just play again.

***UPDATE***
Bumped rating back up to 8 because of some of the awesome online games I've played lately.

Decent game system that has deck styles that aren't rewarded by mass purchasing of rare cards like certain other counterpart CCGs.

RATING: 9
Probably the best CCG I've ever played, the unique (for the time) mechanics, including cards acting as both resource and life, easily made up for the rules complexities and difficulty getting mains.  Great balancing act between having a lot of sites in play, and holding onto them!  Plus a staggering variety of themes, strategies, and play styles.  Still hoping to find a local player who will join me in reliving the glory days!

I heard things got a bit wacky with Episode I, but I'm sticking with the original trilogy anyway, so I'm good.

Well-designed at the start, but fell into the trap of producing more and more powerful cards, so you had to buy them if you wanted to keep up.  I stopped doing so, and started consistently losing games.  Something wrong with that paradigm.

Yet another of the many CCGs I've tried.  Not well designed, but what do you expect of a product meant only to take advantage of a growing fad by capitalizing only on the preestablished popularity of a license?

I have a ton of cards, but no opponents.  I mostly collected the game as a Star Wars fan, rather than for game play.  Can't rank the game much higher until I can really play it against a few people.  With it being out of print, that might be hard to do.  Gets a 5 for theme.

Loses two points if both players don't have about the same amount/quality of cards, because it then usually leads to a blowout. Even still, the game is pretty awful.

As someone who loved Star Wars, this was a must have for me.  However, it taught me two things -- (1) I can NEVER buy the starter pack of another CCG and (2) a great movie does not mean a great game.

That said, the movie text on the cards saves this from being a 1.

RATING: 6.5
This game basically defined my youth and my social group in high school. The game itself is quite complicated, and continued to grow more and more complex as new sets were released. My general impression was always that if you started playing the game after the first few sets had been released, you would never fully grasp all the nuances of the rules. The game was also hampered by the fact that the best deck strategies all required a large number of hard-to-get cards: often the winning player would simply be the player with the more expensive deck.
Still, if you can deal with the ridiculous complexity of the game, this is a very entertaining card game. While the game hasn't been formally produced in years, it still has a fairly devoted fanbase online, and unopened product can be found with only a small amount of difficulty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoy the game, but even more than many other ccg's, it suffers from a serious inability of someone with an inferior collection of cards to put together a deck that can beat someone who has dumped more money into the game.

I've spent far more time on the collecting than the playing.  This never really took off in my group with anyone I introduced to it, and now it's long, long out of print (although I still find it for sale here and there, and I've made use of eBay).  Its strictly two-player design and rules complexity that kept getting worse with every expansion were pretty big drawbacks.  Plus some of the fun stuff just wasn't a viable way to win (the Death Star, carbon freezing, etc.)

Overdetailed design killed this game.  This is a perfect example of a game that was crushed under the weight of its own rulebook.  I played this game through the Hoth set, then gladly traded it for Magic.  Skip this and play Doomtown!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Ugh. Not for the faint of heart nor for anyone on a limited gaming budget. Each new expansion to the game resembles a Solaris patch release: &quot;this release fixes degenerate strategies #112311, 229431-229446, ....&quot;. Sometimes the game can be very exciting, for example when Hoth decks match up, but this is by far the exception rather than the rule; the game is just simply not thematic. Combined with the price-gouging rarity issues (everyone - and I mean everyone - with more than 2 spoken line of dialog is rare, and so is Boba Fett), this is not one that has a lot to recommend it. In fairness, there is actually the underpinnings of a decent game in there - I like quite a few of the game ideas, and it&#039;s always nice to see somebody doing a CCG that isn&#039;t just a variation on Magic: The Gathering. But, CCGs are made or broken not by the game system, but by the card effects and distribution - both of which Decipher is horrible at in general.

I have sets for "Premiere" and "A New Hope" so, regarding those sets, the tactical choices in the game are more plentiful and interesting than your typical "build your deck around a formula and then run the formula" ccg. As such, this is an excellent game even without the collectible part. 

I've seen some of the rules and cards from later sets but I really don't feel the need to explore them as it seems like the rules just became bloated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is fanfare at its greatest. Every character, alien in the background, ship, vehicle, article of clothing, line of dialogue, and more is conceptualized into some game mechanic. There is a trivia/lore section for every card to expand your dorkdom. A+
With that said, it is not Magic: The Gathering and you cannot enter play with such quality expectations.
I played this heavily in Junior High, so it has a soft spot in my heart. To this day I think about it on a weekly basis. I wish there was a card editor program out there that had this template.

RATING: 7
One of the better CCGs out there, Star Wars CCG might take you some time before you fully understands the rules but once you do, the game is amazingly fun! There's a lot of tactics in this CCG which is nice and I do like the idea of having Planets and Locations that your character/vehicles/aliens can move between. One of the best CCGs I've played!

I tried to get back into this for the sake of my son, after many years and a foggy memory. I acquired a bunch of the old cards from the original release. I tried reading the rulebook and just playing with him.

We found that the rules were not clear and that the game went on for a LONG time. Also, it just wasn't fun.

I'm normally very leary of the CCG sales model, but this 'extinct' game with a captivating Star Wars theme seemed like a possibility. It just isn't. He enjoys cataloging his cards, but I don't think we're really ever going to play this one.

The starter set was ok, but did not really prepare you for the full game. In order to really play outside the starter, you would have to acquire planets and starships, which did not seem to be particularly common. The cards themselves were cool, but the lack of players and amount of dedication required to even be able to play beyond the starter is its downfall for me.

Production: Fantastic card layout, with great photos of the characters, and very interesting text blurbs.  There is so much information packed onto these cards, yet they don’t feel cluttered.  Play: In the beginning, I had so much fun playing the base set.  My tastes have now changed, but I still like to play the original every now and then.  Note: Because there are a wide-selection of non-collectable games, I don’t feel I can just wish the collectable genre out of existence, but I want to express how completely disgusted I am with the collectability of games.  The increase in cost is not commensurate with an increase in fun, yet games based on pre-existing characters (Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings) don’t feel right without the inclusion of all the key (expensive) characters, thus necessitating the huge cost.  Noone forced me to buy these cards, but I was somewhat addicted, living for the gambling thrill of opening a pack, in the hopes of scoring that ultra rare card with a character who is actually familiar to me.  (2+0+4) (22 plays)

RATING: 7
Great theme + okay play = Good, but not great, game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This was the first card game I really got into. As far as I'm concerned, it's a classic, even though it can be vomit-inducingly complicated at times. Some cards refer to characteristics set into a card's flavor text, which can be frustrating--If you have a card that only works if you have a "Spy" on the table, it can get quite frustrating.

However, the whole idea that your deck is the Force and you use/lose it depending on the board is interesting. But again, it can get quite frustrating if your opponent can stymie you. 

In all, this is a very good game, but its complexity, the possibility of frustration and the fact that nobody plays anymore ensure that all my cards are probably just going to collect dust in the closet.

Back in the day I accumulated way too many of these cards - best house rule: 60 or 90 card starship decks - the only way to fit all those capital ships in...have many fond memories of playing into the wee hours...but as more and more expansions came out I dropped out as like with most ccg's...the game became a measure of your ability to spend money on new cards.  I think the loss of Decipher's liscense for the game was the best thing for it...the game is dead so the collectible aspect is mostly dead as well.  There will be no more expansions and the forcing of episode 1 into the SWCCG universe with the Tatooine and Coruscant expansions by Lucasfilm was ridiculous.  The three reflections expansions were really just a way to reintroduce older cards from previous sets again.  SO you have about 8 expansions in addition to the premiere set with differently themed cards based on the more popular locations in the Star Wars movies.  I had boxed all my stuff away in disgust of the endless money machine but now I am gaining some renewed interest - the game is great with tons of strategy and variety and I have more than enough cards as is to create both light and dark decks endlessly for continued gameplay.  I only have a smattering of cards from the later expansions but they are great for a bit of variety rather than hindering gameplay.  There are tons of cards and it would be easy to get bogged down in the sheer number of cards but a great way to play is to decide on a theme before getting together and construct decks accordingly for a game.  For example, build location decks like "hoth", "endor", "death star" or build character decks like "aliens", "empire", "republic", "trooper" decks or ship decks like "capitol", "fighters", etc.  This adds great flavor and variety and removes the difficulty of going through tons of cards to build a deck and removes some guesswork in trying to counter potential decks of the other player.

2. Ilosc nowych dodatków wydanych tuz przed utrata licencji przez wydawce byla zbyt duza. Dodatki nie byly przemyslane. Zachwiany zostay balans gry. Powstaly 2-3 typy decków które byly praktycznie nie do pokonania. To dodatkowo dobilo te gre.

The rares were way too rare in this game.

Mechanically, the best card I've ever played.  Love star wars so of course love the theme as well.  balance was an issue, however, and silver bullets often invalidated a lot of previously valid (if not powerful) strategies.  i think a duel-deck format would have done well for this game though.

This CCG has some unique elements that separate it from other CCGs of the mid-90s.  This is one of the earliest concepts of using cards as currency (e.g. "force") that I can think of.   You also see cards flipped for random numbers, almost like rolling a d4 or a d6.   The mechanics center around controlling locations, not totally unlike the main concept of Battle Line, actually.   Unforunately, the card art is very weak - stills from the movies, and poorly reproduced at that.   The cards are very uninteresting also, because all of the known characters are rare, making the game a huge investment just to get the main characters.   This starter set plays pretty well out of the box, but I don't think it will see a lot of play.  This ends up being one of my least favorite CCGs.

Decipher's Star Wars CCG tends to be pretty polarizing.  Its fans cling to its deep strategy and herald it as the best card game ever, while its detractors rail against its complexity, poor rare distribution, and use of "magic bullets" to keep the game stabilized.

Me, I lean towards the latter opinion.  The basic mechanic of draining your opponent's deck of cards is brilliant, as is the way you can choose to use the Force to play or draw cards, but man oh man is every other aspect of the game absolutely drenched in unnecessary convolution, a trait that might actually be appealing to a certain kind of CCG enthusiast.  I never really figured out how to move characters onto a starship.  I'm also not a big fan of card games in which players are forced to play opposing factions, especially not in a game with only two factions.  You will often get in arguments over which player gets to play the Dark Side.

RATING: 5
Not quite sure what I think of this game yet. On the one hand, I like the central mechanism of cycling your deck and your cards representing your life force at the same time.

On the other hand, it looks like Decipher made the exact same mistake they also made with the Star Trek CCG: the good cards are rare and hard to get and common cards are mostly rubbish which makes playing with a cheap collection rather difficult and also means that the player who sinks more money into the game usually wins.

This game was great.  Even better that I got to play so much without ever buying my own cards.  I kept up with rules right through Dagobah, but then I lost track.  The game loses its 10 due to the fact that the rules changed with every expansion to the point that the game got too confusing for its own good.  (That, and the CCG marketing system.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Death Star II expansion and older makes for the best game I've ever played.  Newer expansions lost the feel of the game by streamlining everything.

The game is so much more intuitive than other CCG's.  Combined with endless strategy and viable variety, it's a massively replayable game that is my only 10/10 rated game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I can't say enough about this awesome CCG.  The learning curve is enormous, but once it has you, you "see" the entire game system and what it has to offer...then things like force drains, attrition, movement...all second nature.  The fact that it's a SW game--a definite plus.

Rarity and card combo overkill.  A good game Idea, but deck design could lead to some decks just about playing themselves while the other player sat and waited, unable to do anything.

RATING: 8
An incredible diverse and good game. Actually all cards had some situation where it would be the best card in the game. Not many TCGs can boast of that. My first love when it comes to CCGs and TCGs. Unfortunately, the game development got out of hand during the last year of its license, and at the same time the game died.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good game, but you had to have most or all of the rare cards for it to work.  That's a pretty big investment for something that's only a "good" game and not a great one.

Being a big Star Wars fan at the time, it was worth it for me, but I wouldn't repeat the investment today.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very good card game that involves strategy, and does a great job of bringing the classic Star Wars Universe to life. It was disappointing to me when Decipher lost the contract of Star Wars after episode I, and it went to Wizards, but the game lives on. Like most CCG/TCG's it can be more about deck building than game play. This is why I feel building two balanced decks to play each other is best. Space is often a necessary component to this game, but I almost prefer a single planet based deck, if paired with another. As such, the second 2-player starter set (Hoth)was very well balanced. Being out-of-print and seldom played makes it harder to adapt your deck. However, I've recently learned about online play that makes it both affordable (free) to change and update, as well as opens up more play. See the links. www.tinyurl.com/gempswccg

At it's peak, this game suffered from a rare case of being overly popular yet under appreciated.  In my opinion, this is one of the most innovative card games to date.  The game mechanics offer a delicate balance of strength, cost and destiny (the luck factor), and the Star Wars theme was integrated perfectly.  However, it did suffer as being a 'collectable' game and therefore a money sink.  Truly ahead of its time.

RATING: 6
A nice introduction to the Star Wars CCG put out my Decipher. This box set is great as a stand alone game, or you can expand on it.

My only beef is that Lucas decided to drop Decipher after it had created this huge CCG game with many many expansions, and years on the market, and let Hasbro make a new CCG. So I had cards worth $30-$50 go to values of $0.50 in a matter of months.

Sigh...


On a whole the CCG itself suffered from "we made some new rules for this expansion" syndrome, so by the time they got to their 6th expansion, there were so many "Card types" and so many rules, that it was just so convoluted. Not only that, they had certain cards (I believe "epic cards" or something) which were main events, usually the climax of the story that you could play. However in order to accomplish the goal on the card, your entire deck had to be structured around that card, and you had better hope that your opponents was too. Then you had to get all the cards out in the right order and hope that card comes out last.
Then you have to hope that you successfully do all the things you have to do.

The cards are near impossibilities.
Another expansion "Dagobah" gives cards for training characters as Jedi. However it's such a waste to "train" someone as a jedi, when you can just put Jedi into your deck (if you own the cards). By the time you actually train a character to be effective, the game is over and you've lost.

Here's to that!

RATING: 5
Nice looking cards but ultimately a soulless, overly complicated game with Star Wars characters added. You have to arm your characters, so often times you have a silly situation like Darth Vader and Admiral Ozzel entering the Cantina and then getting into a fist fight with Biggs, Obi Wan, and two Jawas.

The game drained away lots of cash, gave me a few thrills, and now I have tons of cards that are worth...nothing. I could have bought cards from Arabian Nights, but no, I bought this shit.

The Hoth and Jabba expansions were a lot of fun though, and I'd gladly play with strictly Hoth and Jabba themed decks.

RATING: 9
One of the best, and I'm a bit sad that I never got to play it competitively.  Mechanically beautiful, thematically perfect for the Star Wars universe.  If you can think of a theme from the SW films that you'd like to play, you could put a viable deck together with it.  EASILY the best CCG based on an outside license ever, and a contender for the best licensed game of ANY kind.

I took this game way too seriously for a few years, long ago. I liked the experiance, but it ended being too costly on the wallet. Gave up when I realized I had thousands of cards yet still couldn't build a decent deck (never won a single game in any tournament I was in). There was a number of awkward things in the core game that only became worse as the expansion packs piled on, with crazy decks that were not in the spirit of the game or setting. Still, I like the idea of playing characters as cards, on locations that are of cards, carrying items made of cards, and using special abilities with yet more cards. Complex and convoluted as few games before or since, and I love that part. That, and it is Star Wars, in a game that matches it's theme fairly well, as well as add to the lore with numerous flavor text. There was a few attempts at a Star Wars trading card game since this one went belly-up, but none were as good. It may not have been perfect, but it had a lot of unique elements to it, and I would love it if they were to make a new version that kept the greatness of the old yet improved upon it.

In it's day, this was second only to Magic:TG. Though I spent much more money on this then I even did on MTG, due to the fact that I used to be a crazed SW fan. It's still a great game, which you could now collect quite cheaply, they should never have changed the format, it's still a great game. It has it's flaws, no doubt but I love the game.

*UPDATE* April 2011...after reading about SWCCGPC and download the rules and the card lists, I've set out to catalog all my cards, fill in my collection a bit, add some of the virtual cards, and get to playing this about after a 10 years hiatus. So far I've spent five nights(2-3 each) sorting, sleeving(I had a bunch unsleeved), catagorizing, and logging my collection...and I'm still not done.  It's a daunting task to say the least and I haven't even begun printing out the virtual updates and adding those. Haven't gotten too far into the new rules either since most of my free time involves the cataloging part at the moment. 

*UPDATE* I have to laugh at my last update because I didn't do a damn thing with it and I haven't played it all and really not even seriously considered it. It sits in my closet taking up precious space. Nonetheless, I still can't part with it.

Star Wars CCG is an interesting game in many respects: shared locations, concept of "force drain," and deck depletion as victory condition. Turn sequence is very regimented, so careful planning and timing are key factors. Good attention to detail (e.g., attrition rules) and a variety of decisions to be made at every turn. Above average learning curve and weakness of starter decks (you really have to buy at least a few booster packs or singles to make it enjoyable) make the game less accessible than I would prefer, but definitely a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Collectible card game that based health on maximum sixty cards left in your deck -- including settings, which characters were limited based on narrative to start at. One significant aspect was that later versions of the heroes came out with each narrative point for those planets, so it was easier to get a Luke, Han, etc. More significant was the fact that a star hero deck could easily be taken by a well thought out theme. Sadly, George Lucas wanted something more kiddy friendly and Decipher lost the license -- at which point support collapsed.

MEGA PLUS: deck strategy was more important than characters, use of theme/narrative
PLUS: multiple versions of star characters, effective mechanics
MEGA SUPER MINUS: George Lucas killed it - not game play

I have been always a huge 'Star Wars' fan, so when I once saw a preview of this game in a magazine I thought it would be the best thing ever, but because I was living in Spain and many of this kind of things never get published there, I had very little hope of ever being able to acquire it. 

Then on one of my trips to Australia I was ecstatic when I found the starter set on a shopping center. I bought it and though I sadly never played the game with someone else, I still loved playing it solo (strange, I know). Then I found stores where they sold booster packs, and bought a few every now and then, what I liked best though was to examine all the common and uncommon cards catalogs and buy single ones that I wanted, I could spend hours looking at the cards just to buy several for a couple of dollars... I still remember that I was really proud when I bought a single rare card for $7.00 ('Blizzard 1') :D

I got on the game by the time they released 'The Empire Strikes Back' expansion (second one if you don't know), naively I though to myself that I 'only' had 3 card sets to collect :D But then they release the third one, with already talks of another one... it was then when I started suspecting how these games 'work'. Fortunately I stopped there, and though I still have my little collection of several hundreds, and they bring good memories, I am glad that was enough to learn the lesson about CCGs ;)

UPDATE: I have discovered that you can play this game on the PC! The program is called [url=http://www.holotable.com/]Holotable[/url] and of course you can choose any cards you want! This is great because even though I haven't tried it yet against another player (you can play online) as I said I used to play this solo, so I am now playing again the game, and better than ever! ;)

The original Core Set. I tried to play right after I got it (when it was released in 1995) but didn't really "get it". Never bought any expansions or boosters (just the bonus that came with the original set). I lost a few cards over the years but have replaced them so it is a complete set. The box is NOT in good shape (complete and works as a box but with some dents) from poor storage by a kid who had not learned to care for his BG boxes yet.
Given away in BGG Rummage-o-rama 2014

I am mainly a boardgamer and this is the only CCG I have played seriously, but damn, its good.  Superb mechanics.  All the theme.  Addictive.  It IS REALLY complex though.  Do NOT attempt to play this casually - you are either all in or all out, but once you are in there is no getting out!  A complex forerunner to San Juan, in that the cards function as money ('using the force') as well as their usual functions.  The system is so flexible - you can play out any scenario in the movies: rescue the princess, duel Vader, bounty hunters, blow up the Death Star, Hoth speeders, jedi training, turn Luke to the dark side ... you name it you can do it.

Cannot be missed from your collection if you like Star Wars. It's hard to find people to play with, due to the time it takes to get familiar with the rules.

Ever since I was in grade 5 in 1995 I have played this game. I have only ever played my cousin, but we played very often, mostly not using the proper rules.  Eventually we turned to using the rules and found out how the game really works, but it is still fun.  One of the things we didn't like was the force draining, but we came to terms with this and realized it was how you have to win.  My favourite part was always making huge space battles.

Thias is a really great game and it could be the perfect CCG/TCG. But the chances a big that one plays a ground Unit and the other a spacecraft game, so you just drain force which wasnt fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I am rating this based on the game play and putting my now developed disapointment of CCG behind me. The coolest part of this game is the 'force' mechanic that drains a persons deck. You must balance using your cards while realizing that every card used brings you closer to a potential loss. The attention to detail and flavor text is the most loving I've seen to a name brand product. Wish to goodness a stand alone version of this were possible without the collecting and deck design. Would play only this game until I die if there were other people with unlimited collections and desire.

Something to remember "Decipher makes bad CCG" don't even touch them with an 11' pole. One of the worst game I have ever played. I imagine george lucas never played it because it's so bad that I even wonder if it could be considered playable. You need more than 30 cards in play before you can actually start to do something. If I were in place of george, I would have put my veto and said "make a game that at least, I can enjoy!"

I first saw the ad for this in a Boy's Life magazine.  I decided to buy it and thought this is perfect for a nerd like me.

I have a few booster packs, like 25+ but don't really have any powerful cards or good decks.  

Mostly I like the lore that is found on the cards but the cost of getting good decks and keeping up was too much so I gladly switched to complete games in a box.

Had a deck in junior high.  Empire with the Executer.  However, I even knew at the time that the system sucked ass.  Way too complicated and way too hard to build a nice storyline without leaving yourself completely open to destruction.  Attrition was also a convoluted and poorly implemented addition.

Played this for a year or two when it first came out.  Eventually, I decided to sink my funds into M:TG cards instead, since it was easier to find games.  I was tired of buying new "Luke Skywalkers" who were more force-sensitive by 1 point every few months too.  The gameplay initially was interesting, but not enough to make up for the "buy new cards or suffer defeat" aspect of the game.

RATING: 6
The first CCG I sank a lot of time and money (relatively, as I was a poor college student) into.  The first few releases were a lot of fun, but poorly balanced.  It suffered from a few big problems.  First, they tried to promote combat, but the fact that you fought on 2 fronts (space and on the ground) meant that sometimes one player would focus on one front and the other player on the other front and there would be no interaction.  Second, the designers tried to push strategies that required little monetary investment, but they always gave way to terribly broken strategies.  Finally, the power creep was ridiculous.  They tried to introduce a new strategy every set that completely trumped all previous strategies.

This is a complex game:  Even if you play without Virtual Text (which is found at  swccgpc.com), there is a steep learning curve.  It takes a long time to learn all the different cards--and you really do need to know what most of them do--and to learn what decks are popular with your group (if you're lucky enough to have a group).

That said, its complexity is useful because there are many, many different things you can do in your decks.  For example, my favourite DS deck is based around the Star Destroyers holding a few keys systems near the Death Star.  My favourite LS deck is a Hoth based snowspeeder deck.  Those are just examples:  You can do almost anything your heart desires.

Decipher published this game from 1995-2001, so don't expect to find cards at your local game/hobby store.  Prices on eBay and other sites go up and down, so some times are better than others for purchasing cards.  If you want to get competitive with this game, you'll have to learn about and use virtual text, which runs the gamut from fun to annoying to downright broken (until the SWCCG Player's Committee issues errata and fix it).

Expect to spend A LOT of time to learn this game and play it well.  But if you can...there's just nothing that compares.

HOWEVER, if you're interested in a CCG-style game but don't want to invest too much and want to find other players easily, try Blue Moon or Dominion.

This was the most eagerly awaited game of 1995 for me. There were several delays for the initial print, which drove me nuts. I couldn't wait to try this. This was the first good, post-M:tg ccg. The complexity level was high and the overall level of design,support and feel of the game was spot on. I didn't hear about L5R until early 1996 (Shadowlands release) but this was the best CCG of 1995 in my experience. SW:CCG and L5R are worlds apart and I haven't done a comparison between the two to determine which one provided a better experience for me during their life-time. (Yes L5R is still in print as of July 07) But, to me, L5R as the game it was in the mid to late 90's no longer exists.

RATING: 7
A CCG that I spent lots of time and effort in just for being *Star Wars*.
Beautiful mechanic for the flow of the force with Draw/Force/Used pile, but as expansions were released the game suffered from the illness many TCGs of the time suffered from: Lots of extra marginally useful rules mirroring movie events by top-down-design. Still, it was *Star Wars*, damn it!

Valuing fun oder success and playing in the legendary competitive tournament scene of Bochum, Germany, I never got very good at the game. But I'll never regret my decision to instead play only fun stuff like Stormtroopers, Jawa Sabacc or Battle Droids. I even took pride in being one of the most lowly ranked players in the world (of which there were almost 14.000)!

This is another expandable card game where large chunks of the rules do not come into play, even if you have a huge number of cards.  Piloting and weapons almost never matter; person-to-person combat matters more than space combat, which is very dull.  The turn sequence is too complicated for what this game is.

RATING: 7
I collected this from the beginning and have the complete set up to the Episode I bull shite.  As a child of the 70/80s I loved StarWars.  I was playing Magic at the time so the CCG aspect wasn't daunting at all. I threw myself into it.  I'd even go to tournaments, which for me was unheard of.  Sadly by the time Special editions came out I was getting a more than a little distressed.  I had fewer and fewer people to play with and a huge closet full of common and uncommon cards that were never going to see the light of day.  I dropped CCGs in general after this and moved to boardgames.  I still have all my cards in ring binders and read through them occasionally.  Remembering fondly when in a tourney, I used a jawa to "Disarm" Darth Vader and got to listen to the kid cry to the judge for a full 20 minutes before it was decided my move was good.

Whilst I like the mechanics, I wasn't enamoured with the fact the coolest characters (Han, Vader etc) were rare as rocking horse s**t, and so were their ships. Plus the game eventually drowned under the sheer weight of additional sets.

RATING: 1.1
This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Side Note:  This was my favorite collectible game.  I was unaware of how shitty Decipher was as a company at the time.

BEST. CCG. EVER. Hands down.  If I could marry this game, I would.  It even remained quite awesome after being tainted by the prequels.  

Yes, it got bogged down with a lot of expansions but that's the glory of the game: you can customize it to however you prefer.  It is only beaten by KoToR when it comes to Star Wars gaming experiences.

Ah, childhood nostalgia!  *swoon*

The first ever game that I dreamed of playing CONSTANTLY when the rest of life got in the way.

A game that fully encompassed EVERYTHING within the Star Wars universe.  If you could imagine them doing it in A Galaxy Far, Far Away, then you could do it in this game.  I remember losing a tournament game to a mate mositure farming on Tatooine once.  Seriously.

A better CCG has not been made.  This CCG was what gave MTG a good run for its proverbial money in the late 1990s.

Sadly, things started to get a bit bogged down by the sheer number of cards (2,000+ ish) and special rules they created towards.  Having to print off an FAQ every few months was a sign that some over arching changes were needed.  That and each expansion's addition of a newer, better 'beating stick' hearlded the end of the fun.

I shed a tear when Decipher lost the Star Wars license.  Ah, who am I kidding.  I bawled like a baby!

This game represents a large chunk of my 'childhood'.  If you can find a few players in your area now-a-days, count yourself among the lucky!

May the Force be with you!

This should have been so much fun, but the scarcity of major characters and vessels really killed our enthusiasm.

Very fun game that collapsed under its own weight.  The original game is simply great.  Very innovative and evocative mechanics.  Love it.  Each expansion added complexity to the point where I have no idea how to play anymore.  Main problem with the original is the high cost to play... all the famous characters are rares.  I collected this complete through about Jabba's Palace or so.  Phew!  Did a lot more collecting than playing, but it *is* fun to play.  If you stick to the original game and first expansion or two, then I would rate it a '9'.

I came for the cards, and tried the game. It didn't gel. Strangely enough, that's how it felt that the game was designed, certainly for the first sets, almost like the cards came first and the game came second. In the end I traded all my cards for a collection of Star Trek CCG cards. Frankly, it felt like in terms of playability, I got the better deal.

RATING: 6
The second CCG I ever played. It seemed more fun than the Star Trek CCG my friend and I were already playing. Sunk thousands of dollars into this game.

Each release was cranked out without being thoroughly playtested which made for lots of errata and an ever increasing rule-set.

After the terrible prequel movies polluted the Star Wars universe, for many years this game retained my fondest memories of Lucas' brainchild.

This may be a good game to a [i]collector[/i], but to a player it's terrible.  A good CCG (not this one) is winnable with common cards, strung together in interesting, inventive combinations.  Rare cards should be for flavor, not game-wrecking (like here).

For examples of CCGs done right (i.e. made for fun, not for collecting), check out Mythos, INWO, or especially Fleer/Skybox's Star Trek: The Card Game.

This created my initial love then hatred for CCGs.  I had to get into it being a Star Wars nerd and collect and play with the characters and ships I've followed and enjoyed over the years.  I was thrilled to battle my friends with this type of game.

The problem was that being a collectible game, people had incomplete decks, thus became inbalanced depending on whom you've played.  Additionally, it's just too expensive to play and compete to collect the cards.  I don't want to spend craploads of money to have a partial game.

The game also takes a while to play.

The best CCG I've played, tough to incorporate outdated cards though.  As with any CCG, need to have a balanced deck.  Best to agree with your opponent on a theme, then have decks based around that.  That way you can incorporate fond memories of the movie in a re-created battle.

My very first nerd game.  This was my first introduction to games other than Life and Monoploy type stuff.  I bought the starter box with the only money I had as a little kid, and about cried when it was too complicated for me to understand.  I actually spent the next five years or more figuring it out.  That game has some pretty complicated rules, but it once you get it it sure is great.  My buddies and I would spend ALL night playing games containing 1000 cards or more, and it would spread out across the whole floor.  I like this game because of its versitility.  You can quite literally do just about anything you can think of your characters to do, in any place throughout the star wars movies (and then some).  Incredibly customizable.  SO much so that you almost have to agree before hand what type of deck you're going to play so you are both on the same page.  It's not much fun in one guy is flying x wings in space and another is hanging out with Jawas in Jabba's Palace.  However, on the bad side the battles can get pretty annoying.  The tendency is to amass huge armies or fleets in one location that eventually ends in a huge showdown that takes forever to count up power and battle desitny modifiers and weapons draws etc etc., only to have to do them all again on the next battle phase.  Otherwise I don't have much bad to say about it.  Decipher games are pretty great.  Just watch out for the power creep.

Absolutely one of the most difficult and absurdly over-appreciated games of all times.  This "game" is an exercise in frustration to learn and a further lesson in bankrupcy to attempt to compete.  Without the license, this aberration wouldn't have lasted six months in the ccg market.  Avoid at all costs. (Edit '06)  Ha Ha!  See?  Wars completely tanked.  Nothing more exhilarating than being totally right.  :)

Update (2013):  Hasn't held up well.

This was the game that got me into gaming.  I was very much into the game and competative play.  I had a darkside deck that only lost once in 2 over years of tournamnet play, but I never could build a lightside deck to take me from a good player to a great one (I finished second or third in a lot of tournies).
As I reflect back I can see how many of the the mechanics were subpar and very unthematic.  But there were some bright spots about it too.  At the very least it will alway have a nostalgic appeal to me.
Eventually my attention had to be torn away from this and put onto college.  I sold off my cards before the bottom fell out of the game.  I still kinda wish I'd kept them for collection purposes though as they are very sharp looking cards.

This WAS a pretty good game.  The mechanics were decent, and you got to say "The Force is with you" at the end of all of your turns.  It has everything you love about ccg's.  Great variety of cards, nice looking cards, great theme (star wars), ultimate flexibility in deck building, etc.  BUT it has everything bad about ccgs as well; power rares, marketing scam, binders of useless cards.  What really turned me off was getting my ewoks' butts kicked by a 10 year old with a bunch of high-power rare characters.  Also got beat by an experienced player with a well tuned deck, also very rare heavy...I'd never even seen most of the cards.  Still, the game is good, but only with players of similar collections/skill level.

I did collect up a number of SW CCG cards, back around the time it was released. It was all very well-presented, the mechanics were simple, and it would just be so cool to be able to play a Luke Skywalker card, or a Darth Vader one. But a great many of the cards' subjects were (necessarily, I admit) tiny, background parts of the movies for just a few seconds (I'm pretty sure there was a "blue milk" card), and this game seemed to suffer from in-description rules exceptions more than MTG. I certainly wouldn't be able to remember them all.

Had a huge collection when I was younger.  Loved Star Wars and gaming, so this was a natural fit.  Still, even back then (despite being quite good at the game), I never saw why people loved it so much or how it was supposed to be fun.  Combat was incredibly rare, as victories were achieved most efficiently by avoiding the opponent or murdering them in one fell swoop, all while Force Draining the crap out of them.  A Star Wars game should have had a lot more combat interaction.  

Also, so many cards were useless it was silly.

RATING: 6.5
This game was quite innovative in the CCG space and has some very clever mechanics and ideas, but it is generally bogged down with minutiae. The way resources is handled, through force generation, is quite elegant and is one of my favorite mechanics that came out of the glut of CCG's in the 90's. The idea of your deck being your life is brilliant, and has since been copied by many other games. The idea of dice rolls being replaced by "destiny" numbers on the top of cards is also a nice touch.  I love the fact that every thing you need to play the game is included in your cards. No extra dice or counters to carry around, just a deck of cards.

Yes, there is a lot to like about this game. I really appreciate the underlying systems that make this game work, but the sad fact is: this game is on the boring side to play. It is very procedural, and there are a lot of little rules (too many, most added for flavor) to keep track of. I think the base system is quite elegant, but just go out and find some of the 150 page rule books out there for all the exceptions and errata. One of my least favorite rules is that if you accidentally get ahead of yourself and skip a step... tough luck. I don't know how many times I just barely started a phase, and then realized I didn't force drain the opponent. Oops. Having an opponent enforce this rule can really kill the experience, especially if you are like me and are a little scatterbrained and are constantly thinking ahead to what to do next.

The game also seems to move at a snail's pace. I prefer snappier pacing to games, but this game is ponderous at best and anyone with a little bit of AP can make playing this an excruciating experience. It's a shame, because the game has so many clever ideas and elegant mechanics to it. I'd love to see someone take the base ideas for this game and make a stand-alone/refined "Race for the Galaxy" style game out of it.

This was my favorite game for many years in the late 90s to early 00s.  Me and my brother played every weekend or every other weekend at worst.  He was better at game time strategy and I was better at setting my deck.  Made for some interesting battles.

Awesome for Star Wars fans.  I have since moved on to games with 3+ players, other than war games.  In my opinion, this is the last of the great ccg's.

I've never had enough cards to do what I want. Maybe if, one day, I boost my collection by a few thousand I can raise my rating.

Update: I played some preconstructed deck games with my wife as a refresher for me and we had fun with it. Soon I'll put together some decks on my own. It is a lot of work to accurately keep track of all the cards for a game like this. Probably not worth the effort gamewise unless you play in tournaments. At least I have Star Wars fandom as an excuse for the mania.

RATING: 7
Mon jeu de repli après avoir mis [gameid=463] de côté. J'espérais un jeu qui pouvait être aussi riche avec moins de cartes. Côté richesse, c'était plutôt réussi, avec un système de jeu malin et précurseur. Pour la quantité de cartes, gros raté, étant donné l'importance des cartes rares dans ce jeu. Impossible de faire un deck un tant soit peu compétitif sans avoir la totale des grands héros de la saga (de préférence en plusieurs exemplaires), dont la côte pouvait atteindre le prix d'une dizaine de boosters, tant la puissance de ces derniers était démesurée. D'ailleurs, la très grande majorité des cartes communes était profondément inutile. 

Je ne sais pas si c'était dû à la popularité moindre du jeu, où si je l'ai abordé à un âge plus mûr, mais l'ambiance des salles de jeux semblait moins malsaine qu'à [gameid=463]. Ce qui ne m'a pas empêché de me faire niquer sur un point de règle lors d'un tournoi important et de me faire piquer mes deux decks le jour qui a marqué ma mise en retrait définitive du jeu.

Encore une fois dommage, parce que le pari stratégique était plutôt réussi, avec un jeu un peu moins hasardeux et plus complexe que [gameid=463], avec un « plateau de jeu » qui se construit pendant la partie, un système de contrôle des territoires, une dualité « monnaie/options de jeu » des cartes, qu'on a retrouvé plus tard dans [gameid=8217] ou [gameid=28143], sous une autre forme. Toujours par rapport à [gameid=463], dommage que ce jeu ne pouvait être pratiqué qu'en face-à-face (pas de jeu en équipe ni en « free for all ».

Un dernier mot sur le traitement du thème, extrêmement réussi, tout du moins jusqu'à la sortie de la dernière (et ultime) extension sur le thème de l'Épisode I, qui a fait exploser les situations d'anachronisme (par exemple, la présence côte-à-côte d'Anakin enfant et de Luke Skywalker…), qui a marqué aussi la perte de la licence Star Wars par l'éditeur Decipher et la mort du jeu, remplacé par des succédanés ([gameid=5260], [gameid=2130]…) qui ne sont jamais arrivés à la cheville de celui-ci. J'ai déjà croisé des boites de jeu soldées ici où là (à Essen, notamment), si vous pouvez vous procurer une boite de l'édition originale ou spéciale pour quelques euros, ça peut valoir le coup d'essayer ce jeu. Sinon, l'arrivée de [gameid=28143] ou de [gameid=36218] a quand même donné un sacré coup de vieux au genre.

One of the BIGGEST disappointments I had with CCGs ever.  Decipher decided to make the mains ultra rare and that's not fun.  Cards that emphasized the minutiae of Star Wars made it less fun.  What a waste of a license -- though I now realize that Lucas is a whore.

Easily my favorite CCG ever.  I enjoyed the elegant mechanics of your deck being your life and the method of keeping score.  I loved actually playing at places instead of some conceptual arena.  I loved the whole destiny aspect for generating "randomness".  Sure it was quirky and had a steep learning curve, but once you learned the system, it flowed pretty well.  To me, it was the only CCG for serious gamers.  

At one point, this would have rated a 9, but I've not been able to find anyone to play with in years.  Amazingly, nearly 2 1/2 years after the license ended, people still spend money on it (1600  auctions on ebay alone!).

This game is a personal "10".  I love Star Wars and this game allows me to create and play exciting adventures in the Star Wars universe.  The rules themselves could be a little tighter, but it is a good system with exciting gameplay.  While not as elegant as Magic, there is a great card game here with depth and solid mechanics.  With a complete collection, you have access to hundreds of locations, characters, creatures, vehicles and ships which let you play almost any Star Wars senario you can dream up.  If I could only have one game (heaven forbid!) this would be it!

My friend and I bought into this game up to the Cloud City expansion. While there were many viable decks and strategies, we were only interested in playing huge games of space combat, with fleets of Corellian Corvettes and X-Wings taking on Star Destroyers. Great stuff. An extremely well designed game, the use of the cards as your life force was a nice addition.

Great card game that has a very interesting mechanism where the cards are your life and your locations cards are access to your life.

This is another one that I love the *idea* of. I never found anyone to play it with me, sadly. Well, my friend Matt tried a couple of times but we usually hit a snag in the rules that we could never figure out (it had to do with having "presence" at a location), and that always ended any hope of progressing. Eventually, I stopped trying, and now sadly it's out of print. Still, I sometimes pull out the cards and browse through them wistfully. "Oh, the possibilities..."

This isn't bad, but the whole Dark Side/Light Side mechanic is a bit fiddly, as is the attrition step in battles. The whole "force drain" to mill away the other player's deck just isn't an inherently exciting goal or mechanic. And - perhaps the biggest drawback - this is the poster child for CCGs that make all the cool character cards rare, meaning you need to invest a tidy sum of cash before your deck will be populated with the Star Wars names you actually know. The game is complex and deck-building can be pretty interesting and challenging, but Star Wars CCG would likely rate much lower if not for the theme and nice movie art.

Wow. An epic game. A complex game. A huge game. Star Wars CCG stands as one of the few games that I didn't entirely understand *at all* when I played it. And I played it quite a bit. The game is very complex with a steep learning curve that almost (read: definitely) requires new players to be taught by an expert. But, all the complexity and depth pays off: the game itself is very deep. The mechanics are very balanced and the differing paths to victory are many and varied. If this game were more accessible I would recommend it to anyone. As it stands, players looking for a huge game, this is one that they can really sink their teeth into.

This started out as a mediocre game with many poorly designed cards (look no further than the Stormtrooper or the mass of completely unplayable common cards in the premiere set). Rares were dominating. Over time the game became much better, but also more complex. At the end of its life a typical beginning game state for one player would consist of a two-sided objective card, 2 or more locations, 3 starting effects, and a stack of defensive shield cards. Non-interactive strategies became less powerful over time, but always existed during the lifetime of the game. But games could lead to lots of cool memories. I still chuckle about the time Leia shot the Emperor with her blaster pistol on Tatooine and cleared that site with Chewie's help...

RATING: 7.5
I had so much fun playing this game in the 90's. Probably my favorite CCG ever. Despite lacking the design elegance of Magic (thank you Richard Garfield), Star Wars feels more soulful than its CCG brethren. The game suffered some growing pains throughout its life, with some questionable design choices (objectives - fine, "silver bullet" cards - lazy and lame). Still the most thematic Star Wars card game to date, but it had trouble with solving the "theater" problem - how does my Tatooine mains deck interact meaningfully with your TIE swarm deck (it doesn't - a drain race ensues).

I would love for a streamlined version to become an LCG, but it will never happen. Instead, I have dedicated my card selection into a series of "movie match ups" dedicated to relieving the various movie sequences using objectives and thematic cards.

***Update***
After finally playing through each of my dozen "movie match ups", I have a modern day feeling on the game - it's still great! I had so much fun playing this with thematic decks built to capture movie sequences and combat each other.

Awesome thematic moments:
- Obi-Wan and Luke escorted Leia out of the Death Star, but Vader defeated his old master in a duel.
- The LS destroyed the Death Star, but lost to the massive Imperial fleet.
- The DS took over Hoth with an army of AT-ATs.
- Luke rushed through his Jedi training, but ultimately lost in a giant battle on Cloud City after Han was frozen in carbonite.
- Jabba fed Lando to his Rancor, but met a gruesome fate at the Pit of Carkoon after unsuccessfully feeding Princess Leia Organa to the Sarlaac.
- Luke and Vader dueled back and forth on the DS2, but ultimately Luke convinced his father to return to the Light as a multitude of Ewoks smacked around a legion of Stormtroopers.

So many great moments, but the game does show its age. The game length can drag a bit, and the number of pieces needed to complete some tasks is absurd. An updated, streamlined LCG with improved mechanics (such as the attrition "hit" happening before weapons like in the WARS TCG) would really make this game sing. I don't think we will ever see such a thematic card game version of Star Wars, given FFG's propensity towards more generic abstractions.

The game has an endless supply of situations depending on the decks that you build. I have experimented with non traditional ways of playing the game (i.e. board game-style) and the cards still hold up. I collected them as a kid (which was super fun) and started playing as an adult. Since it is out of print, the online platforms (GEMP, Holotable) are good for learning strategy from some great players but it's also fun to teach friends how to play.

RATING: 6
I have a lot of love for the Star Wars CCG. It was the first "build your own deck" game that I ever learned to play and it was light years ahead of its time. The unique use of the player's deck as both a life counter and a resource system is one of my favorite aspects of the design. Drawing a ton of cards gives you more options, but every one that you draw puts you one step closer to defeat. Brilliant. The destiny mechanic is also a neat feature that manages to add both randomness to the early game and control in the late game (provided you know how to use it). The game also handles space battles and character battles equally well, which is quite an achievement considering the scope of the Star Wars universe.

Early sets featured iconic movie stills, while later releases added some high quality CGI productions. The card titles themselves are all highly quotable and the flavor text is incredibly well done with loads of easter eggs and inside jokes for hardcore Star Wars fans. By far, my favorite feature of the game.

The expansion sets for the game were a mixed bag. On one hand, I'm amazed at the effort put in by Decipher's designers to recreate the movie. There are mechanics for blowing up the Death Star, Jedi training, bounty hunting, carbon freezing, and even pod racing! They really did bend over backwards to try and recreate almost everything in the films...all within the framework of a sixty card deck. As amazing as this achievement was, it does have a down side. The most recent rulebook and FAQ weighs in at 158 pages long. A lot of this is clarifications, but even so...the game had all but collapsed under it's own weight, even before Lucas Films pulled the plug on it.

This game started out great, but the expansions (from Degobah on) turned it into a terrible system cluttered by rules and driving people to endless purchases of boosters

More of a collectors passion for me. Played through one example game - but need an opponent really.

I think this may be my favorite game of all time.  The theme was great.  The game packed in both strategy and tactics.  It is far superior to Magic: the Gathering and every other CCG/TCG I have played (which is somewhere around 15 different ones).  There were some disappointing sets released in its final few years, where the designers kept adding crazier and crazier things to the game, but at its core it had everything I want in a game.  I no longer have my cards, and playing online is less fun than in person.  I really wish this was still being made though.

Actually I only ever bought 2 preconstructed decks & 2 booster boxes (Premiere), just to fool around with the cards a bit. Later I bought a big lot of cards but not really valuable ones to fool around with some more. Haven't really played this.

I played with the Hoth starter set.  The game was nearly impossible for the Rebel side to win; the Empire has AT-AT's!

I played this several times when it came out, in the late '90s, but I never really understood what I was doing. I still have my cards and have heard that this is one of the best card games of the era, and I wonder what I was missing. Is there some sort of document telling me how to play ?

I enjoyed this game back in the day, although I sold off most of my cards (I still have a complete set of the original black border release). I liked that they tried to fix broken cards with other cards, rather than issuing errata (although they eventually succumbed to this) or banning/restricting cards.

Good for learning more about the Star Wars universe, bad as a game. There are big ideas here, but they don't work in practice. Many of the cards are far too specific, such that you'd never use them and we'd often find that two decks would have such differing game plans that they'd barely interact at all.

A totally different feel than Decipher's Star Trek CCG. Immense fun that captures the feel and action of the movie.

As a massive Star Wars fan, I had to have this whether it was good or not.  Initially, it was "not".

It took me a long time to understand how this game was played, to the point where I wondered if it was a game at all.  I found the rules massively complex and unintuitive; it took several abortive attempts to get to grips.  Once I did I found there actually was a game in there. 

But .., over the piece I'd have to say I wasted far, far too much money on this.  Never touch a CCG unless you are a Russian Oil Baron.  This was a real money pit.  Of the thousands of cards I have I must have around two dozen recognisable SW characters with the rest being extras who had three seconds of screen time.  And all for the sake of a couple of 60 card decks.

I still have 2 boxes of cards. Would love to play someone sometime. No one ever wanted to play me. :(

Still, I love the design of the game.

Dizzying and poorly written ruleset hides a somewhat intriguing game, once you sort through the spaghetti. Although the end-game is not quite as exciting (IMHO) as some other games.

After 100+ Plays: Haven't played this in years, but I enjoyed it quite a bit back when I did play.  Avoided copying Magic and came up with a unique and interesting game system.

I like this quite a lot, maybe more than it deserves only because it is Star Wars. The mechanics are a lot different from MTG. Just a sad thing it is a CCG.

Very fiddly system.  I don't find the game itself wonderful, but the star wars universe is treated with love and the game has lots of cards and deck archetypes that fans will appreciate.

Sealed Booster Box.  All rares with Premiere and plenty of extras.

This is a great, yet complex, CCG.  With innovative mechanics meaning no counters or life points are needed, and great use of locations giving it a psuedo board game feel (and in the Star Wars universe to boot), what's not to like?  The fact that all the 'mains' (main characters) were made rare was a real bug bear of mine back in the day, but thanks to the wonders of ebay and the bottom falling out the market, you can pick em all up for peanuts now anyway.  Its a top game with limitless possibilities!

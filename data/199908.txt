A decent, relatively short "ready-reveal," trick taking card game where taking just the right amount of cards, no more, makes for interesting decisions.  I liked it, if not loved it.

Im surprised this isnt rated higher. I grew up on trick taking games like Euchre and Dragonmaster. This almost feels like a trick taking game but with very interesting concepts of figuring out when to win and when to lose.

I really really enjoy this game.  It is light enough to lure in non-gamers, while also having some slightly meatier elements to keep other folks in as well.  Perfect amount of depth for the length.

Tricky card game with some interesting decisions to make. I like how it uses a trick taking mechanism without the game being a trick taking game. Got a review copy from the publisher, passed on to Things of No Interest after reviewing.

Felt a lot like Wind The Film, and not just because I learned both games with the same people in two consecutive game nights. "Get some cards, but don't get the wrong ones!"

This feels a little shonky when it comes to how "what do I want right now?" connects to "what's my long-term plan?". But the gameplay around achieving a particular short-term goal is fun, at least.

裏向き一斉公開バッティングゲームとしては、バッティングさせた方がいい場面、バッティングを避けた方がいい場面、さらに適度な手札による揺らぎ、これらがそれぞれいいバランスで成り立って、読みと計算による運ではなく技術によるゲームになっている。

RATING: 6.5
It took me a minute to wrap my brain around this, but now I see that there's a clever little game in there. The act of balancing your spires and hand of cards while trying to deny others of what they need kept my mind engaged, although there were often times when I felt like the game could use a little...sprucing. There was just almost always a card that nobody wanted, so it made the game feel deterministic to a certain degree. It was fun in the end though, and kept everyone engaged.

Spires is a six-suited deck of cards with some special bonus cards mixed in. You collect cards throughout the game building suited sets in your tableau. At the end of the game, you score 5 points for every card in a suit that you have 3 or less cards in and 1 minus point for every card in a suit that consists of 4 or more cards. So you want to build broadly across suits with shallow card counts. "Scroll" cards can also be won that allow you to remove cards from your tableau or get 5 or 10 bonus points at the end. There are also 3 icons spread across various cards in which you can collect majority bonuses of 20, 15, and 10 points depending on the icon.

Players have a hand of 5 cards and three market bidding cards. At the center of the table are three markets (I, II, and III). Every turn, a card is added to each market without a card and then players blind bid their market cards to indicate which card lot they want to shoot for. If only one player bid on a market, that person collects the card(s) and adds them to their tableau. If more than one player bid for a market, all of those players compete for that market by blind-bidding a card from their hand. Cards matching the suit of the market cards are higher than off-suit cards and off-suit cards are at face value. The suits have an order of hierarchy if there's more than one suit in the market. The winner of the bid then adds the market card(s) and all cards bid by all players to their tableau. As you can see, the more players competing at a market, possibly the less you will want to win that bid. Having low cards in hand is very valuable. Every card is uniquely numbered so cards can be valued independently regardless of suit.

I had not played a T.C. Petty game before, but his previous designs interest me and I went into the Kickstarter for this one because of the calculated risks and devious nature of the bids. I'm not disappointed! Also, the game is beautiful with art that I would describe as simultaneously whimsical and austere. Even if you are not a fan of blind-bidding in general, and I am not, I think there is a Knizia-style cleverness here that is well worth exploring.

Enjoyable mix of blind bidding, trick taking, set collection, take that and hand management with refreshingly unique art style. At times it feels like all the mechanisms create a solid combination, but occasionally they don't seem to be interlocking that well. The scoring system is pretty exciting and reminds me of Coloretto. The solo mode also works surprisingly well.

Nicely done card game. There's a lot of tension and depth without a huge rules overhead. I always like trick taking-ish games in which you absolutely do NOT want to take tricks sometimes and have to figure out how to avoid them. Also, great artwork.

Sorta of a trick taking game? Sort of a set collection game? I don't know. The art and look of the game really drew me in. I almost backed this one on Kickstarter, but didn't. I'm still not sure if I made the right decision though and would be happy to find this in my collection.

[b]Spires[/b] was sold via auction 7/20/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I Kickstarted Spires because it was billed as a trick taker and I thought I'd play with my dad and son [i](we play a lot of card games together)[/i]. After a couple of plays I realized my dad wouldn't like the game at all, mostly because in Spires trick taking isn't the main element. Instead it's more of a drafting game with the potential for some trick taking. 

In short three cards are laid out in a market numbered 1 - 3, next everyone secretly selects a market card which has the number of the market assigned to the card they want, if players select the same market then they each play a card from their hand to try and win the trick (i.e. card). There are some rules that govern which cards will win a trick and it is very straightforward. The game is all about collecting sets of each of the six colors, but no more than three of a color. Collect anymore than that and you lose points. On some cards of each suit there may be one of three symbols, the person with the most symbols also scores some extra points. This really didn't add much to the game because of the random nature of how many of those cards show up and ended up feeling tacked on.

I 'll admit I got sucked in by the beautiful art and didn't research the actual game play enough. I'm guessing that a lot of folks will enjoy what the game has to offer, personally I was expecting a much different game. Spores reminded me of a more convoluted version of Coloretto and for what I want out of this kind of game [i](something quick and simple to teach)[/i] I'd much rather play Coloretto, which is a much more streamlined game.[/i]

Elegant play, easy to learn with interesting strategic options. Really love this one.

RATING: 7
A neat hybrid of the action selection of Basari and the set collection/avoidance of Coloretto. One card per player is put in the centre and players simultaneously indicate which one they'd like to take. Any uncontested cards are taken immediately into your tableau, while contests are resolved by blind bid of hand cards. The winner gets the card in the middle plus all the cards that were bid. 

The twist is that you don't necessarily want cards. Up to three of a colour is worth 5 points each, but go over three and it's -1 point each instead. There are a couple of other complications - a few special cards and three majority scorings for symbols spread across the suits. Quite often you want to deliberately choose the same card someone else is after just so you can lose the blind bid and spike them with a card they really didn't want.

I've played three times, twice with 3p and once with 4, and enjoyed it even more each time. There's a fair bit of subtlety to the way the numbers and symbols are distributed across the six suits and a healthy dose of dickishness too.

--Jul2017-- Pleasant little set-collection game.  With interesting collision and bidding dynamics.  It seemed that (distinctly unlike other blind-bidding games) one was inviting collisions; and I was as happy to lose (occasionally happier!) to lose a bid than I might have expected.  I'd be interested to see how play mutates with further exposure.

RATING: 4
This rating only reflects my experience playing the solo game. The solo game did not feel very compelling, like there was very little decision making I could do and I almost think it shouldn't have been advertised as having a solo mode.

Once I get it to the table with more players, I'll update this rating. I expect it will go up.

Spires hadn't been on my radar until a friend picked up a copy. Hearing that it was a trick taking game piqued my interest, but when I heard it was the same designer as Xenon Profiteer I was really interested in trying it.

Spires is a trick taking-ish set collection game. There's a deck of cards going from 1-72 broken into six suits, or colors. So cards numbered 1-12 are purples, 13-24 are yellow, then blue, red, black, and green. There's also a few special cards in the game. Players start with five cards randomly. They also have cards numbered I, II, and III which correspond to a common card area in the center of the board.

Each round cards are assigned to the I, II, and III spots in the common area. Each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of their cards matching those areas and then reveals their choice. Any player who is the only person selecting an area gets the card there uncontested. It is then put into that player's tableau in front of them.

If multiple players have chosen the same area then there is a contest to see who wins the common card. They must play a card from their hand. The player who plays the highest card in the suit of the common card wins. They get not only the common card, but all the cards that were played in the contest to win that card. All those cards go into their tableau. After the round is over, every player who played a card to a contest gets a replacement card to bring their hand back up to five cards. Any cards not claimed in the center persist into the next round.

This keeps repeating until the deck runs out of cards and there's no more cards in the center area. At that point you discard one card from your hand, merge all the remaining hand cards into your tableau and score the game. For any suit where a player has three or fewer cards, each of each card counts as 5 points. For any suit where a player has four or more cards, each card counts as -1 points.

There's also a contest to see who has collected cards with the most crown symbols, sword symbols and quill symbols, which score 20 points, 15 points, and 10 points. Those symbols appear on some cards (presumably in a somewhat random fashion). The player with the most points wins.

The specials cards in the game include Aces, a 73 card, and bonus cards. Aces are considered the highest card when played in the appropriate suit and nothing when played off-suit. The 73 cards is unsuited, so never beats a card played in suit, but otherwise always wins. It must be assigned to some suit when played into your tableau. The bonus cards either give points straight out or let you discard 1 (or sometimes 2) cards from your tableau.

This is a fairly quick clever game where you want to take cards but not too many. When you go into a contest for a common card, you might very well want to lose the contest to stick the winner with a bunch of cards they don't want. I really enjoyed this one a lot.

I didn't see much appeal to it - it ends up being very chaotic and the scoring rules means you want to duck "tricks" most of the time, which I think is generally uninteresting.

It works well and I enjoy it, but I can't help but feel like it's missing some real depth to its decisions. That will probably improve as you form a metagame over multiple plays, but it still lacks a proper hook to keep people coming back.

Trick-taking-ish blind bidding to set collect with vaguely Coloretto-ish scoring... the trick-taking part has stuff like: suited play, trumping and sloughing... the scoring part has vp cards, bonus points for collecting symbols and positive/negative scoring sets... good family filler...

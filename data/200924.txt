Played at Essen 2016.

I played this dice game at Essen and came away satisfied. It has a nicely implemented bidding system with enough complexity to make it feel like luck isnt playing too big of a role which for me is an issue with most dice games. On theother hand it is nicely streamlined so you dont feel it being overly complex. Some of the scoring options are in my opinion to random and can cost you a game as well as a bit unbalanced. All in all a very nice game, wouldnt mind playing it a few times more.

Simultaneous Yahtzee sprinkled with some euro set collection mechanics. Quite fun if you don't take it too seriously. Luck comes in multiple layers here; The dice you throw, the 'take that' actions of your fellow players or whether a certain tile is available to you. There is ~some~ planning, but no route is safe for the other players' dice throws.

Played once at Essen '16. I suspect it's a tad too long for the depth it provides.

Nice upgrade of Alea Iacta Est; the new swappable building add significant range to the game. The new theme makes slightly more sense in some cases, although the art and presentation is a little more generic (to me). Alea Acta Est is for me one of those games that always overperforms - it's a lot more fun than it maybe seems like it should be, and I always enjoy it. So I'm looking forward to playing this.

Great game and would rank higher except badly needs either quick location reference cards or better symbols to remind players how each one works/scores. 
Also components are good, but so many piles of cardboard tokens! Some of those could easily have been replaced with decks of small cards and made the game a whole lot easier to set up and manage. I hate having to have a 4 inch tall stack of cardboard, I really hate having to set up 4 inch tall stacks of cardboard.

Roll dice to bid on assorted chits, and combine these within various restrictions to complete sets. 

Allocate dice to at most one area; generally try to "one-up" your opponents by either initially outbidding them or adding to a previous bid. Yahtzee-like categories: straights, combos, sets of only one value, etc.

This has some pros and cons over Alea Iacta Est.

pros:  some variability in the setup.   

cons:  the variability might also make some interactions less interesting.   Colors in this production are amazingly bad.  Orange dice are almost red.  Red and green dice are a problem for colorblind people.   The people colors don't match the region colors (i.e.  the red people are orange, the blue people are sea green, the brown and grey people are hard to distinguish).   Seriously, did anybody even look at a pre-production copy and approve it?  There's no way.    The box is also much bigger.   I miss the humorous artwork, too.

There's still a good game in the box, but this version has a lot of misfires compared to the original.

It took a long time to get this game to the table. I read through the rule book and thought the game mechanic look a bit of a shambles..... I couldn't have been more wrong! We've only played with two players but ended up trying pretty much every combination of buildings in one session. Wonderful stuff (apart from the Illuminati building which doesn't really work in a two player game as it just makes the whole thing very vindictive).

  A great dice placement game modeled after Area Iacta Est.  The rules and mechanics are identical as far as I can tell, but the designers added several locations that can be changed out each game.  This adds replayability to keep the game fresh. The theme is fairly well pasted on, but it's good.

Another Mitch and I playtested Sunday before we left. It's a reimplementation of Alea Iacta Est. At first I was a little worried the yahtzee thing would be boring, but it actually was a good little game.

Would rather play Alea Iacta Est -- mostly due to production problems with this version.  Specifically, the poor color choices and tiny iconography.   Thought they could have just figured out how to make the Senate tiles more understandable without having to reference the rule book and then reprinted with just those changes.

Dice rolling done right! In addition to being a solid overall design, it has that certain addictive something that makes you want to play it again and again.

There's lots of dice mitigation, non-obvious choices, and interesting methods of set collection, all combined into a quick game with amazing artwork. Extra building options add to replayability.

Interesting dice placement game, with variable boards - fun and different with every role  of the dice. Could use more placement possibilities though, I guess.

Artwork very nice, but colors used are awful, with it often not being clear what goes together.

Furthermore, the scoring is intricate and not that logical - there should be more of a bonus, I feel, for having complete sets.

Kíváncsi voltam rá, ezért Társasjátékok Ünnepén gyorsan kipróbáltuk öten, és mindjárt egy visszavágót is játszottunk! Aztán meg is vettem..
A kockadobálás valamiért egyre élvezetesebb számomra; ez a játék pedig erre épül. Ezért a szerencse szerepe nem elhanyagolható, ugyanakkor ügyes játékkal felül lehet kerekedni rajta. A témája bár engem érdekel, itt mégis kicsit furcsának éreztem (igazából bármi lehetne ráhúzva). Sőt az egész kicsit többnek akar látszani, mint ami: dobunk a 8 kockánkkal, ebből szettet építünk, és ezen szettekkel licitálunk egyes helyekre, hogy különböző akciókhoz ill ponthoz juthassunk. Nagyjából ennyi az egész egy nagyon csili-vili köntösben, kimagasló újrajátszhatósággal. Engem mindenesetre megvett kilóra, bár azt továbbra is fenntartom: kicsit sajnos túlbonyolított ahhoz képest, mint amit nyújt.

I've wanted to play this for a long time, and I'm happy to say that I enjoyed myself. Unfortunately, Grey Fox continues to make stupid mistakes that keep me from taking them seriously.

First off, the rule book has some serious typos that could confuse people who are new to this game. Also, why do all the places you put dice have to be separate pieces of cardboard? At least make it so all the A-tiles that you use in every game are part of a central board. Along with this, there could have been more symbols on the various locations to tell you more than just what dice combinations work there. It would have been nice to know how you hand out rewards without digging into the rule book. It's not like many of these locations are intuitive either. Some hand out rewards to the person with the best dice combo, while others give out rewards to everyone who has dice there. I know the tiles have nice artwork, but for Pete's sake, make this game more user-friendly!

Admittedly those are all kind of nit-picky things, but Grey Fox always seems to stumble with their games in one way or another, and it's really frustrating to see them continue to do this.

As for the game, like I said, I liked it. I like having to balance out where you're putting your dice, and you have to be careful not to get caught not being able to place yours if someone is about to go out before your next turn comes around. The variable setups are a nice touch, and the way you score points actually makes a lot of sense (Though a scoring track or sheet would have been nice, which is another reason why I think a central board would have been an improvement on Alea Iacta Est).

That being said, there are two things that really dampen my enjoyment of this game. One is the setup. There are a TON of cardboard chits in this box. You definitely get your money's worth in cardboard. Unfortunately, you don't use most of it in every game, so deciding which locations you use and setting each of them up individually is quite a chore. Normally Grey Fox does some good inserts, but this one was rather disappointing. A better one would have really alleviated my problems here.

Lastly, I really wish that you had more dice to roll in this game. I love the freedom you have to put dice wherever you want, but I really wish that you could roll another 4 or 5 dice every round. Depending on what people roll, some rounds can be really short, and I want to be able to place my dice on more stuff! Admittedly though, this would probably go against the game's design. It's just something I found myself wishing for as the game went along.

All in all, this is one of the better dice games out there, but I don't think I'll be keeping it. The poor production decisions by Grey Fox coupled with the long setup time really kill it for me. I feel like the setup is too long for a filler game, so unless I'm playing at least a couple games of this, I would rather play another dice game that takes the same amount of time, but sets up in 2 or 3 minutes. 

This would be a 7 if it wasn't for the horrible decisions that Grey Fox made for this reprint.

Order of the Gilded Compass is a dice game in which players roll a number of dice, and try to make those dice into sets to place in various buildings.  Unlike Yahtzee-style games, in this game players spend their turn placing one set of dice, and when their turn comes around again, all of their remaining dice are re-rolled.  When all of the dice are placed, each building resolves, with the players with the largest sets getting rewards.  The game features a variable setup in which different buildings requiring different sets may be available each round.  On the whole, I thought the game was fun, but I did feel like my actions were dictated more by the dice results than by any sort of grand strategy I had.  And while I do appreciate variable setup, in this case I thought it made the game a little disjointed--I would have preferred if more of the building rewards were interrelated.  Still, this is a decent light dice game.

I wasn't too fond of Alea Iacta Est, but hoped this reimplementation would fix certain things. However you stay at the mercy of quite a lot of luck (rerolls aren't a garantee for successes in contradiction to dice manipulation; and you also need some luck on certain loactions when drawing tiles). If someone would ask, I would certainly play this, but I don't think I'll chose this one if I would have to chose a dice rolling game.

I'm not sure how to rate this.  '7' was what I had given Alea Iacta Est.  For whatever reason, I wasn't very impressed with this, but I'm not sure why.  It just didn't seem very memorable.

Nice and light dice game. Better than "Favor of the Pharaoh" as the choices are more interesting.

tl;dr: the same, maybe different?

I have played [thing=40760][/thing] twice when it came out. I don't remember much about it, but it was enjoyable, that much I do remember. Apparently I wasn't all that impressed as I only gave it a 6.5/10. I must say that I enjoyed this game as well and it did feel rather familiar, but there also where some elements that didn't ring a bell. So I guess this game is not a straight re-theme, but more a re-implementation (OK, I admit, I'm too lazy to look that up). So I enjoy the different strategies offered by the different locations that require different ways of playing the dice.

RATING: 8
So years ago I played a friend's copy of Alea Iacta Est just once and loved it. Any time I would play a new Yahtzee-style dice game it just couldn't compare. I started to wonder over the years, though, if that one game was a fluke or if this game was really just that good.

So I grabbed the new version of Alea Iacta Est, now rethemed as Order of the Gilded Compass, as soon as it was available.

It's not a fluke. This is the best dice game I've ever played.

Right away this game improves on almost every other dice game by having you roll eight dice every round. Other dice games suffer from rolling your four or five dice and just never getting the thing you need. With eight dice you have real choices every round about how to use those dice. Do I go for a big straight to get that bonus, or do I use my four-of-a-kind to make sure I get the tile I need? You never feel like the dice are against you.

Aside from the great dice mechanic you've got some pretty simple set collection. You claim different colored map tiles with your dice and you claim different colored specialist tiles, and if you get matching colors by the end of the game then they're worth more points. Very simple, but it offers more to think about than just grabbing the thing that's worth the most points.

This version of the game actually improves upon the older version by offering more variety. Instead of having static options every game you can switch it up with different elements. You can add in a building that lets the players gain special abilities, one that offers different ways to score end-game points, and more.

And what if I said this game could be played in about 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes at the latest? Yep, the game just flies by even with four or five players.

So far I don't really have any negatives to say about this game. It's great, everything about it is great.

Update: I will say that some of the building setups aren't as good as others. My initial comment is based on a game using the Treasure Hunter's Guild and Sunken Galleon. I don't really like the Hidden Temple/Magical Items so far. The Magical Items are a big investment that require a lot of luck to pull off and there's little reason to take them in the final round. The Auction House is also a little iffy, because you can just get unlucky and lose out on a lot of points.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4-5[/b]
Well, maybe this is slightly negative if you have a smaller group. The game just isn't meant for two players, and even with three players there is a dummy player element with special rules. So for me this game is relegated to four or five players only.

I'd had this rated an 8 and it probably deserved that ranking.  However, the more I play games the more I lower my ratings when I think a publisher or designer has made major errors.  In this case, while this is in many ways an improvement over Alea Iacta Est, it's also a step backwards.  For one, the artwork is dark and dreary.  And I'm sorry, but I have to strongly disagree with others who like the theme more.  It doesn't work.  In the original you were putting together couples to create houses. Here's it's about two specialists at an archaeological site.  This all sounds very thematic and on paper it is.  But it doesn't translate in the mechanics.  This is a simple dice game.  The brighter, sillier art and the mechanic of putting two people together to create a family unit made sense even if it didn't create a highly thematic environment.  Here, it just leaves me cold.  It's all math and horrible dark browns.  Blech.

Re-themed and updated version of Alea Iacta Est with archeologists and dig sites adding some improved set collection challenges for the senate and the temple.

This game just seemed "okay" to me.  There was nothing special about or particularly fun about it, but it wasn't horrible either.  The component quality seemed a little off (the colors, etc.).  I suppose I would play it again but it wouldn't be my recommendation.

Overall, fun game that will get better once all the buildings are understood. Hopefully the publisher releases an FAQ or something to clear up some errors and/or omissions from the rules. Better art/theme than Alea Iacta Est. Good game at 4-5 players but lacking at 2.

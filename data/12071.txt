GAME: Second Season Pro Football Game
RANK: 4475

RATING: N/A
A very interesting take on pro football. The simplicity of the ratings don't reveal the flavor that the system delivers which is pretty rich.

RATING: 9
Another excellent game from plaay.com.  Rules are well written and the game is easy to play.  Don't let the basic ratings fool you (players are rated 0-2, with 2 the best), they play a significant role in the outcome of a given play.  Lots of seasons are available both from the game co and home-brewed sets.
The only negative is the chart flipping, but they are releasing a new play book which will significantly reduce that.  Once I get one I will probably bump the rating up.  NOTE - new chart book does help speed up play along with the quick reference boards for special teams and other actions.  Rating is now a 9.

RATING: 8.5
This is possibly the best solitaire statistically based tabletop football game available.  For this reason, I have played more games of Second Season than all others combined.  The game is easy to set up and game mechanics are easily learned.   The game book brings the abilties of all players into play, not just the skill positions.  This appeals to many tabletop sports gamers and is more than likely why this game is rated so well.

Well designed game that captures just about anything/everything that can happen in a professional football game.  I have found it the perfect solitaire football game because it takes up such a small amount of room on the game table.  The folding of a team sheet to have one team's offense interface with a defense teams is great!  I would give it a 10 if it weren't for the page flipping and chart look ups (but I also realize that to have the depth a game like this has there has to be multiple auxiliary charts).  Have only played the game solitaire so I don't know how it would play head to head.

Funny simulation of NFL football, with many tables to consult to determine the result of the action. Better point: speed of game in comparison with other table football games.

PROS – Very realistic, gets individual players involved in this consummate team sport. More like real life, ie: multiple fumbles on one play. Guide available to create your own teams.

CONS - The gameboard is lackluster, but I didn’t buy it for the gameboard.  Needs more PDF format seasons available.

Have only played one solo learning game, but the game looks really fun. Pretty detailed, which makes for a long game, but also has a feeling of a real game. Good story elements.

This game is very realistic and easy to play. Completed a College Football Playoff with Homebrew cards and was very fun and compelling.

This is a fabulous game and card free!  It is flexible enough to allow one to create teams (re draft) fairly easliy.  Many complete sets are availabe for previous seasons unlike the competition.  I am half way through a replay of the 1980 NFL season with redrafted players but the original quarterbacks.

Along with Inside Blitz, this is a great solitaire game of American Football.  Laminated play result book and built in stand makes chart flipping a bit easier.  It still takes me about three hours to complete a game.  Lots of extas (past teams, solo play charts, etc.) on the Replay and Table Top Sports Game web-sites.  I own the Great Teams I & II Sets which provide interesting historical what if match ups.  The Replay line of games (Baseball, Basketball and Second Season Football) are professional quality and worth the investment.

Bought it, read the rules, looked forward to it, then baseball season snuck up on me and I started playing Strat-O-Matic Baseball instead.
Never fully been played or entirely out of the box. 
In great condition.

The best tabletop football game available and I've played most of them.  Lots of seasons and for $5 you can buy the rating system and create your own.  Every player matters, not just the skill players and the game creates a dynamic narrative.

RATING: 10
The best football simulation game I've ever seen.  The involvement of all players, and also knowing WHY a certain play result happened, puts this game above the rest.  It feels like real football.  You can also purchase a guide to rate any teams and players that you want.

Not much of a football fan but I seriously like this game for the story telling aspect.  The game mechanics give you the reason why you gained or lost yardages.  Really cool.

Great, immersive game with more detail than it might seem at first glance. I love how teams are contained on one 8.5x11 sheet. The newest version has really streamlined gameplay and an active forum coupled with outstanding customer service makes this a football game mainstay in my house. There is an additional "How to..." guide which enables gamers to rate any season they desire.

I suspect this is better for old time football than the 21st century version, where every good qb completes 60 percnt of his passes.  Not so much a game as a toy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The good news: Charts for lots of classic old teams are available as well as current teams plus a great system that makes it easy for you to recreate any team you want (there are even instructions included on how to do it!)  The bad news: Lots of chart flipping means sloooow play and a loss of the real feel of football.

Pretty much the best American football game I've played. Gameplay is really vivid - the gamebook gives you the feeling that you're watching the game on TV, complete with analysis as to why your play came off/flopped. It's a good simulation : in other words, if you play the teams using the strategies the real-life coaches might use, you tend to get results. All in all, highly recommended.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent football sim, with nice attention detail. The main problem is that a simulated game takes about the same amount of time as a real one--this is getting shorter as I become more familiar with the mechanics. Rules could be a bit better written (although they are better than Replay Baseball). I'm currently playing the 2006-7 season, and, honestly, I have no idea how the Bears managed to get to the Superbowl with stats likes these (especially for QB).

I haven't even gotten into using the advanced rules yet, but this game is brilliant. For players who basically understand football, this game is completely intuitive to play. The chart booklet has a built-in cardboard stand on the back and tabs for every type of play, including special teams, penalties, and rare plays. What really impresses me about the game is how the design lets individual players from all positions affect the outcome of plays, without slowing down the play routine at all. My only caveat is that I feel like at times I'm ending up on the "Unusual Plays" chart too often, but haven't played it enough times to be sure that's accurate. I have the 1960 season, which includes the AFL and NFL. As regards play time, playing solo takes me about 3 hours to complete a game, but for me that includes recording stats, play by play.  In every way this feels like football, with a game system that is smooth as silk. Recreating a football game, by the very nature of the game, requires players to spend a fair amount of time to play, but when you consider the balance in this game among being an effective simulation, providing adequate strategy, plus ease of play, Second Season Pro Football, more than any other football simulation board game I know, plays quickly and smoothly. It's one of the most intuitive games I have ever played.In short, it delivers the goods.

RATING: 8
A solid, fast playing, fun NFL football sim.  Not ideal for draft leagues, but it can be done that way.  Looking up results in a book 60+ times a game is the main drawback, and would make this game a no-go for many.  For me, after a few plays I started to remember where certain charts are located, and the page flipping chores can be split with your opponent.  Have one player look up player ratings, and the other player look up results in the book.  Switch after half-time.  Works like a charm. Some aspects of the game fall a bit short in the "realism" aspect, but this is true of any football sim (Madden included).

RATING: 7
Had this game ranked a bit higher, but now I think the strategy is a bit lacking. The game almost plays itself, which is great for solitaire, but not so great in head to head. Easy to learn, and easy to play, and it does take all positions into account, but it does not seem so dynamic after several plays.

I think Second Season Football is one of the best football board games. The components don't look like much, but the game play is excellent. The strength of the game is the solo play. Each play results in a TV like description of the outcome which is nice for the solo player. The game even has rules for video challenges. The biggest negative would be the time it takes to complete one game. It takes time to look up the results for each play - sometimes thumbing though multiple charts. Plus if you're into keeping stats for each play outcome, you'll want to note them down. If you don't mind the time it takes to complete a game and the lack of any sophisticated game components, you'll find Second Season Football delivers a realistic feeling football game with realistics stats.

The most playable football sim for solo projects. It doesn't have the same level of detail as Strat-O-Matic, but it's easier to learn and the customer service is the best.

RATING: 7
The best solitaire football sim out there, so long as you're willing to spend significant time with the detail.  All players are graded using a very intuitive system, and looking up plays is quite quick, which is essential for games as detailed as this.  Huge variety of seasons available.  The game generates pretty good stats, and the fact that every play is described with a small snippet of text for what happened instead of a pure number is a great thematic touch.  If you're looking to get into the deeper side of football simulation and you anticipate most of your games being solitaire, this is the game you should try.  If you are playing head to head, I'd still narrowly give the nod to [gameid=1498] for quicker, lighter play, or [gameid=4454] for a game of this length.

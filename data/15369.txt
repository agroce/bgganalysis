Well worth the money!  Beautiful game with a very nice combat system.  Counters are great looking and the maps are terrific.  Rules are not too complicated, though figure a training session is required first before jumping into the big battle.

11 After seeing it again a a Con and talking with one of the enthusiastic players I'll give it another try. If I could just wrap my head around the "chatty" rules.

08 The quality of the components is top. I personally miss the full hexes since my eyesight is not so good. But this game - even if it is a good one - is IMHO buried under too much chrome. Drop some of the modifiers, redo the assault rules and improve OP Fire and change the wordy rules - it would improve.

Aunque la cola de juegos para leer reglas es larga, un  día me puse a echarlas un vistazo (y eso que están en inglés¡¡) sólo por curiosear. 
Como si fuera una novela, me piqué con las reglas un montón.Desde que empezé me di cuenta que era el manual de instrucciones mejor escrito que había leido. Reglas claras, fáciles de entender, con múltiples ejemplos, que se repiten constantemente para que no te pierdas. Una gozada.

Por otro lado, si las reglas del juego son fáciles de entender, las mecánicas lo son aun más. A medida que lees te vas dando cuenta que todas las reglas encajan como el mecanismo de un reloj. Los ejemplos clarifican cualquier duda que pudiera surgir y todo tiene una lógica aplastante.

En resumidas cuentas, habiendo leído sólo las reglas me parece una virguería de juego. La pena es que no esté al alcance de todos por su disponibilidad/precio.

RATING: 9
9/26/15: Played Intermediate scenario 1 Race to the Bridge.  Though it's a short game, and the chit draw can throw things off, it's good to run through this prior to playing a campaign game to get an idea of what you need to do as the brits.

7/14/13:  We're winding up a campaign game and here are my thoughts at  this point in time.

Negatives:
1) The problem with perfect information.  If I replay, I want the allies to have latitude about when and where to drop.  If you restrict yourselves to the historical drops, the Germans are just going to position on the landing zones and shoot everything coming down.
2) I still think that the fact that a zero on the dual use chart always results in a step reduction will lead to a lot of assaults with bad units, or as we call it 'bowling for zeros.'
3) The game seems to be pretty linear, especially later in the game.  There does seem to be a preferred path and it's about optimizing your efficiency. 
4) The Campaign game can be decided early by the status of the Arnhem bridge.  In our game the First Airborne got blown out early leaving the bridge wide open for the Germans.  That pretty much meant game over for the Americans.
5) The no need to be in supply.  Units can go off by themselves and spend activation by activation shooting with no concerns about supply.
6) Because the awarding of activations can be so swingy, I'm not sure that I'd be interested in scenarios.
7) Would like the game specific rules to be better written.  Seems like they missed a final edit.
8) Assaulting is overly complicated, but does tell a good story.
9) Differentiating between white and yellow dots on the board can be difficult as well as differentiating between different colors of fighting groups.
10) The fonts used for unit designation on the German counters can be difficult to read.

Likes
1) Really enjoy chit draw mechanic
2) Overall the game is a lot of fun.
3) Enjoy the scale and level of detail.
4) Plays well multi-player. Easy divisions of command.
5) Relatively simple rules
6) The map and counter artwork is really well done, and like the watermarks.  It is a beautiful game.
7) I ended up being concerned about who won, the journey was more important.  This game rewards that.
8) For me the zones of fire and opportunity shots are a good idea.
9) Artillery is powerful in this game and teaches you to respect it.  Enjoy the spotting mechanic.
10) Once you get things down it can move quickly if you aren't trying to make every single counter move perfect.
11) Each individual chit activation goes quickly so there doesn't feel like there was a lot of down time.
12) The command and division activation mechanism works well for me.
13) I like the larger size of the counters and map.  The large activation chits were a nice touch.  I can see these being the counters that wear out first.  I played in a space where the map size didn't cause restrictions.

Neutral: 
1) Not having hex sides is an adjustment.  I think that I would prefer them, but not having them helps emphasize the artwork on the map.     

6/15/13:  I am enjoying the campaign, but do have concerns with how replayable the campaign is.  As I'm playing through this, I get the feeling that there would be many fewer choices next time around and the path more obvious.  

This shines with team play.  I think that the campaign game is actually a little large for just 2 players.  We're playing this in a pole barn down in Newberg.  Would not recommend this for people who just want to play a shorter game.  I think that the scenarios would be too driven by luck (unit activations).  

The nice thing about the campaign game is that the initiative shifts back and forth.

A friend described the monster game mentality is one where you shouldn't be worried about game balance and immerse yourself in the experience.  I would have to agree with this.  After playing this for several months, I finally looked up the victory conditions.

Some people think that the counters are too busy with all the background art, but I haven't found that to be a problem.  Once I start playing I don't even see the watermark in the background.  Bigger issue for me is matching all the colors for the individual fighting groups, particularly the Germans.

The chit activation mechanism really works well with this game.  I'm not sure how balanced the scenarios would be, this seems really geared towards the campaign game.  I'm sure it will be reprinted some day, so don't despair if you don't have a copy (but not anytime soon).

One issue that bugs several of the people that I play with is that 0 on the dual use combat table results in a step loss.  This results in a lot of assaults, especially with poor units.  Often you are "bowling for zeroes" as they put it.

RATING: 9
Have played the first scenario twice, once ftf as germans and once solitaire. The system is very elegant. I have held back on rating the game until I could actually try it. I have a strong feeling my rating will change to a ten after I have played some more games. Using the subset of the rules that apply to the "Victory Lost" scenario, and even with this rather small engagement, the ruleset creates exciting decisions for in a very efficient way. I am enjoying this relatively simple task of clearing the roads. In my solo run, the allies made it to the victory hex after the germans foolishly left the small town of Oosterhaut (?) ungarrisoned. I think this scenario offers a perfect chance to learn the rules, and to learn how to play the game. The many options open to you in each activation offer deep choices, and the orded in which you do things seems to require different optimizing for different circumstances. Meaty package, beautifully presented, and amazing gameplay so far.

I doubled my final rating to arrive at a BGG score.  Suffice it to say attempting to learn it solely from the atrocious rulebooks is a path littered with frustration.

And, after a second play, I'm really thinking the opportunity fire mechanics are a fatal flaw.

RATING: 5
1) The Devil's Cauldron has awesome graphics
- wonderful maps with no hex boundaries (great idea, btw)
- nice counters (yes, some nitpitches: some w-ss leaders has generic WH image etc., but nothing important). I like German army symbols instead of NATO ones used in 90% of wargames. And vehicle images are also nice.

I am realism freak and I appreciate realistic look of counters.

2) Chit driven system is great idea, I really like it. It brings some sort of chaos into game, but controllable, with limited luck. And you do not need "moved/fired" administrative counters. Nice.

3) I like real units, real commanders, realistic OOB etc. It is nice to have whole Frundsberg division with all its units, feldgendarmerie included...

4) Nice idea is to write rules like business processes into flow diagrams.

After reading rules, the game seemed awesome to me. BUT:

1) When we started to play, we were stuck into complicated rules, studying charts, flow diagrams, counting various modificators etc.

Simply: for me, rules are too complicated. I confess, I like simple games like Panzergrenadier, Rommel in the Desert or World at War. I dislike ATS for its complicated rules, I haven't tried ASL and I am not going to.

Some wargamers like complicated (so called "high complexity") games and they probably like DC.

2) I really dislike high density wargames with plenty of administrative counters. This is BIG minus of my favorite wargame: panzergrenadier. And, to be honest, in Devil's Cauldron - it is even worse... Why we have such wonderful counters, when most of them are stacked together or under ugly admin counters? (the admin counters are one of the best ones, but they are still generic admin counters..)

3) Difficult terrain - on those small hexes, where two or three units are stacked with admin counters and leaders on them, it is hard to notice who is on what risen road or what terrain exactly is under these units... Big hexes like in Combat Commander or in ATS: Stalingrad introductory game would help this game a lot. Yes, even now the maps are huge, but...

4) Damn culomns. Sometimes, most of units use this type of movement and this type of admin counter. Increasing density and decreasing niceness of the game.

It is realistic rule, but I'd like some smarter solution...

5) Not much small scenarios included. The focus is on 5+hours games. For me, it is about two times a year, when I have time for wargaming whole day.

RATING: 8
This one is a little bit of a culture shock for a poor Eurogamer, but I'll survive and I think that I'll realy enjoy the game. Having read the rules I am a little overwhelmed and yet strangely confident that I can make it through. The rules seem logical and that should be a good sign.

After the first play I was a little overwhelmed, I wasn't exactly a master of the rules to start with, but we muddled our way through. The second game went better, but more experience is required.

The system itself is very interesting, I like the way that the chit-pull system simulates the fog of war and especially the way that it rewards forward planning and good management of resources. The combat system is a little uninspiring though I like the way that damage is delat with.

RATING: 6.75
Nice looking game with many nice bits/parts. Definitely not a light game, but has a couple of entry point scenarios to get you up and running, before tackling something meatier. While the individual subsystems are not complex, the interactions between them and sheer size of the larger scenarios gives the complexity a bit of an octane boost. Once I have more time with the game the rating is likely to increase. Nice work, Adam!

RATING: 7
I don't own it yet but i'm sticking up a Tatham-Warter umbrella for a rainy parade. Might change my opinion when it arrives.

It's arrived, i'll rate this as my first 11. Production quality of all components is beyond any game i have (and i own most of the supposed beautiful games). This game is an absolute labour of love, truely magnificent design in all respects...anything as good as this will definately attract detractors.

Update...Dropping the score to 9, i spend alot of time looking at the rulebook, irking me a bit (Will i ever get used to assault?). Darn shame 75% of the map is covered with imp positions or column movement.

Last update...Funny how this changed, dazzled i think by beautiful production. I felt at times i was fairly limited in actual choice other than to just keep grinding away. The rules are not well written, a constant battle to keep looking for clarification even after 100+ hours of playing, the assault mechanic has to be one of my least favourite rule sections ever. Beauty of the game somewhat marred by the sheer amount of column and imp positions littering the board. Scenario wise the game is very unforgiving at times in city terrain, a few games i played were decided in within the first 10% of official gametime, playing it to finish was really a case of seeing who survived the inevitable grind rather than who won the scenario conditions, i would note this as more a fault with scenario parameters than gameplay. I like the points system but more often than not the game gets toooo polarised into sector hotspots...worst case secenario was having 1st Airborne Div picked and delayed twice at turn end. Yeah i suppose it can happen but with hours of gameplay its heartbreaking to have your plan broken to bits by vaguaries of chit picking. I played the game alot but feel i'm on the fence...one side mediocrity the other side genius.

What can be said. Minimal errata (always a good sign of a good game). Its a big game, drop dead gorgeous maps, with wonderful counters and great aids. It's a company level game which is about the lowest you can go at a tactical level that actually works for a board game.  The system is scalable with plenty of scenarios from small to massive. I love the flexibility with the Grand Tactical Series.  You want a small engagement, or a large battle, or how about a full campaign? You got it. GTS hits a nice sweet spot between realism and playability. No massive rule tome here. Its a tactical system that works smoothly. Multiman Publishing is currently working on a 3 volume D-Day set (Huge WOW factor!). The Devil's Cauldron is up for reprint and you can pre-order from MMP games (I heartily recommend doing so). They are also play testing Crete (Bring it on!), so a lot is coming down the pike for this superior game system.

RATING: 5
ADDENDA: I'm not sure how much of the raw frustration with this game can be put down to the appalling rulebook. Every time I find myself thinking about it again, I think that this game should be one that I would like. Maybe a couple tweaks to defensive fire, a little cleanup on the whole assault thing might help, a few bits here and there. But a lot of what's in there is good. Unfortunately it's hidden behind a rulebook from hell.
---
Frustration with dumb and lousy scenarios and lousier rules has caught up with TDC (and the scenarios are [i]really[/i] lousy). Trying to find things out in this rulebook while trying to play is like slamming your head against a concrete wall. And every scenario I've played has been boring, stupid, or both. The small scenarios here just aren't viable; the dispatch points are *so* swingy that it seems like you have to play multiple campaign "days" for the thing to be at all viable. The game is also incredibly fiddly and unintuitive in many ways; the thing that really had me throwing up my hands in despair was when the 1st Airborne units were using their Divact chit to do nominally "admin" type moves that snaked between German ZOFs, which felt gamey and lame. Maybe the campaign game is awesome, I dunno. But more effort needed to be put into the smaller scenarios, which currently feel like incomplete hacks. I'll probably give it one more chance, but this has definitely not lived up to the promise or the hype. With so many good monster games out there, it's very doubtful that this will see the table again. I'll probably keep it in hopes that the second revision of the rules will be usable.
---
Play 2 was The Empire Strikes Back, which was more interesting for both sides, but it's *very* dicey for the Germans. There are quite a few *very* high-stakes rolls (rout rolls for the Germans primarily - you can lose huge chunks of your force to rout if you roll badly, with not a lot you can do about it). And if you don't roll dispatch points, you're screwed. If your DivAct is the last chit in the cup and doesn't get played, you're screwed. On the other hand, the 82nd Airborne is an awkward formation - it gets tons of command points, but few dispatch points, a combination which, on the good side, gives great flexibility in allowing units to active, but on the downside, requires a lot of micromanagement and makes for long turns as you have to manage every command point instead of getting a bunch of freebies via dispatch points.

So, I still dunno. There is still a lot I like in the game, but the 82nd is just an awkward formation to command in this particular system and poor-quality units are frustrating. Next I'll go east of the Rhine and see if the matchups up there show off the system a little more.
---
The '7' rating is probably a slightly unfair initial impression, as I can't see my rating staying there ... it'll either go up if the potential the game has pans out, or down if the rough edges I perceive turn out to be real and if the scenario situation is a choice between uninteresting toys and unplayable monsters.

Anyway, I played Little Omaha, not much of a game there for the Germans, but a nice system.

For me, a little bit of a mixed impression. Does feel retro, elements of the graphic design aren't great, player aids could be better (an assault sequence would help), and I think the rulebook is a failure. The chatty, wordy, conversational style is totally inappropriate for a game of this complexity - it's not a hugely complex game, but it's complex enough that you need to reference the rules as you learn, and the needlessly verbose style and weird ordering make this unreasonably difficult. Excessive verbiage is especially problematic in the exclusive rulebook, where obvious things are over-explained and tricky bits (elevated roads, assault ferries) are also over-explained but the explanations feel incomplete.

On the upside, the chit pull system works nicely to convey coordination difficulties, and the Dispatch Points are nice. The Command Points are a mixed bag, at the level at which they represent the fact that you need to spend some time accumulating a bunch of them getting everyone organized to get a formation moving, that's good, but when they turn into micromanagement, or allow units under heavy assault to automatically pass check after check, they feel unrealistic. I'm not a fan of the assault sequence, which is very unwieldy and doesn't seem to put enough emphasis on morale (due to the availability of command points).

But, persnickety details aside which could easily be worked out in a minor rev of the core rules, this was a fun game which I enjoyed and I look forward to playing a meatier scenario. That'll be where the proof of the game is: if reasonably-sized scenarios that allow the CP/DP system to give a feel for the ebb and flow of the battle can be played in a reasonable amount of time. If the only real game in here is the monster, it'll be consigned to shelf space next to Case Blue. If there are good, modest-sized scenarios, this could be a winner, especially if a minor rev to the system rules could smooth  out a couple minor rough edges. And if a machete could be taken to the series rules.
---
Got mine in the other day, looking forward to giving it a spin. Don't know that I'll ever have the time or inclination to do the monster, so I'm glad smaller scenarios were included.

I think the praise heaped on TDC for graphics and presentation is over-done. Some of it *is* great - I like the maps a lot, and the aids are nicely done. But the counters are busy - the background "watermarks" are a design element too far, and the mix of symbols (NATO and German) is, in my opinion, awkward. I'm ready for this phase we're in of experimenting with weird unit symbols to be done and for everyone to go back to the crisp, clean, NATO symbols. Anyway, While I like TDC's overall effect, I think I prefer the cleaner presentation typified by Mark Simonitch in his GMT games like Ardennes '44 and the various von Borries games, or to go the other way, the more dynamic (but still clean) presentation of ASL. The TDC counters to me just seems busy.

I hope I didn't pay too much extra for that historical booklet.

RATING: 7
I've been waiting for this one for a long time: the "grand tactical" is a scale that I think is under-represented in WW2 consims, and it's one that I like, since it combines elements of operational art with crunchy tactical bits. So I'm glad that TDC has finally seen the light of day, that it appears, at first blush, to be a good game, and that Adam (and others) intend to take the system to other parts of the world.

Physically, the game is excellent, with high quality components, very little errata of any significance, and beautiful art. I'm not totally thrilled by the watermarks, but they don't intrude on play. I found the rules difficult to use at first, particularly when trying to find general answers (for example, what effects do strongpoints and OPs have on play? Unless you know that they affect line of sight, the relevant rules section is difficult to find, and even then fails explicitly to tell you that they have no other effects in the game). However, after a few solo games I've developed enough familiarity to be able to locate the answers to any questions pretty quickly.

Games move quickly, and the flow is helped by the chit pull activation mechanism. This is the heart of the game, and it does a good job of differentiating between formations of differing quality; it also models the tempo of combat at this scale very well: dispatch points disappear quickly if units are pushed hard, and a period of rest is required to rebuild their offensive potential. Push a formation too far against well organised and fresh opposition, and you may well find it very difficult to disengage without significant casualties.

Big, pretty, and very playable. Unlike all too many monster games, two players can conceivably play a good sized scenario in an evening, and the campaign (while long) would be a plausible goal for a few weekends of gaming.

Still wrapping my head around this one.  Need a few plays before I rate it.  A chit-pull turn system with some flexibility due to command points.  The rest of the game seems pretty standard as far as wargames go.

UPDATE:  Played it again, and enjoyed it.  There are quite a few modifiers that add up for different situations, which can get somewhat cumbersome.  Also, the stack height can start to grow with all the various effect chits that start piling up.  However, it's still a solid effort and a pretty fun game to play with.  Haven't tackled the big scenarios yet.

The game components are astounding. It could be a 10 just for them (I only do not like the box dimensions; I would have preferred a more standard sized one). I'm full of good hopes as I suppose that the game mechanics should be similar to those of Panzer Command that I've played some years ago and I remember I liked them a lot.

I've tried some small scenarios. I like the barrage rules (a new feature in respect of Panzer Command IIRC). Anyway it's not easy to grasp all of the subtleties of the game mechanics.

Waiting for some new games, I can rate it a 9.

Played this FtoF on April 1st. Training scenario. We both had a great time learning the rules and talking about the actual "tactical problem" in the first intro scenario. Map work is stunning.

Company level wargame featuring the northern half of the Market-Garden campaign.  Forces activate via their organization chit being drawn from a cup.  A fairly clean set of rules gets you up and running quickly.  Fantastic maps - like the "broken hex" look a lot.  They are also back-printed, so they link up for the four map campaign game.  Counters are bit busy for my taste, but at least they are 5/8", and most of the information is generic.  Only tooled around with the introductory scenario to get a feel for it (I'll never play the campaign game - don't have a table tennis table handy!) and like the system.  Looks like a lot of care went into it - support material, different rulebooks, etc.

Fun and furious! Excellent PLAYABLE monster game of Arnhem/Nijmegen part of Market Garden.Only reason it does not score a 10 is because of the style of writing used in the rules,where some things can be made clearer.However the designers do a great job answering questions on the game at Consimworld.

update Jun 1 2008 : I played the "Empire strikes back " scenario solo and had a great time , especially since it was while I was at work on my breaks and after work , I think the whole game took 2 hours tops , and the Germans won by eliminating 4 steps of US airborne troops to a loss of 24 German steps! I think the bigger scenarios really show the Grand Tactical System at its best , lots of manouver and planning . Great stuff! now I have to preorder No Question of Surrender

RATING: 8
Going off the BGG rating system, this one gets an 8 despite me carrying the "fan" microbadge.

I'd love to give this game a 9 or 10 but can't.  Several issues:

1. The system isn't too complex - I actually consider it fairly simple - but there are a few too many "counter intuitive exceptions" in the rules that increase the difficulty in learning and understanding.  Examples, vehicles can't cross streams except on roads, but motorised units can cross in "leg mode" and then mount up on the other side into their vehicles...  OP's can see through (over) several blocking terrain features but no one can see the OP...  A unit in an OP can spot for other units, but can't use the OP to spot for itself...

2. Time factor.  It is not unusual for players learning this game to actually take longer to play out a turn than the turn simulated.  When you consider it is a 9 DAY campaign, that makes for a LOONG ftf session(s)...

3. The map by itself is a work of art.  The unit counters by themselves are works of art.  But add them together with the admin counters and it becomes a fiddle that only adds to point 2 above.  Example - one solitary Infantry company dug in - hit by a mortar barrage and takes a cohesion hit equals 4 counters.  Put the formation leader in the hex who is in contact with three artillery units and it becomes 8 counters!  Want to take another shot at him?  The terrain that applies is a little dot - in the middle of the hex - under the 8 counters....

4. Point 3 above when trying to determine the all important line of sight of 8 hexes and fire zones.  The LOS is "dot to dot" but there are mini stacks everywhere and each has to be moved (knocked over) to get at the dots...let alone determine the line...

5. Terrain dot colours.  My eyesight is good - no need for glasses.  But why similiar pastel dot colours were used can be problematic.  "Is that light brown dot the non blocking village, or the darker brown blocking town?"  Clearer colour choices, and perhaps with dots printed into the "corners" of the hexes would've likely made the map look a little worse, but play A LOT! easier.  As I bought the game to play rather than look at, you know my preference...

I love the game despite the above.  The above could've been enough to knock 4 or 5 points off the rating.  But to be fair and give deserved credit where it is due, the game is excellent and the "excellence factor" lifts the game over most of the flaws.  Solid 8. 

Addenda:  I've nailed my reason for NOT rating this higher and fear in time it may decrease - the combat.  It is almost like the forrest wasn't seen for all of the trees!  This is a combat game, but all the details involved are on the sidelines and the details of combat are washed over and probably the most abstract of the entire system.  Meaning, that despite it being "Grand tactical", the emphasis is on the Operational of "Grand" and the tactical is lost.  Example:  Very precise rules to deal with raised roads and movement (detail), but then ALL assaults are frontal assaults...You can assault the same target from different directions with multiple units in the same activation - but each one will be determined seperately and frontally.  With the mechanic of the activation chits, most units most of the time will only get one (non command point) action in a 2 hour turn.  And that action can't be fire, or even move into the fire zone of an enemy.  So, in 2 hours of battle time, a combat unit even if engaged may not fight - at all.  Those who have played the smaller scenario's will say "yeah, you gotta spend command points" but that's easy enough when you have only 10 units of the Division represented.  Try that when 80 units are on the board.

Try to reconcile that a unit, despite its troop quality, can watch an enemy move upto it - and fire at it - yet it absolutely will NOT return fire or try to protect itself in any way.  It will have no instinct or initiative.  you must directly COMMAND it to defend itself.  

Again, the focus and detail went into getting the cadence of the real life battle (how long it took for XXX Corps to advance) but NOT into the actual fighting.  At the "Grand" or Operational level the game does well.  But at the tactical level it starts to fray.  Once you get into the "tactcial combat" it becomes more like a "Euro puzzle game" than a simulation - unfortunately without the low luck of a Euro game puzzle.

  As many have observed, the above "one action in 2 hours" isn't even guaranteed if your Div Activation is the last out.  It can be very irksome that the net achievement of a unit in 2 hours of battle time was to "mount" into it's own transport...and irksome doesn't go close if the chit doesn't come out and for the unit to gain this wonderous achievement it actually cost a direct command point.....

To enjoy the value of the game you must do as I feel the designer did:  Enjoy the narrative of the Operation - turn a blind eye to the tactical.

From an email I wrote to the designer on Wednesday, March 5, 2008:

Greetings Adam,

I received my copy of "The Devil's Cauldron" a couple of days ago and I'm really, really impressed. I look forward to playing it soon. A couple of things:

--The maps are the most beautiful ever produced for a wargame, in my opinion, and they are easy to use and understand! No ambiguities, yet naturalistic - really amazing.

--The rules are excellent too, I'm happy for the examples. I put tons of them in "Panzer Command" too and I'm glad you continued that trend.

--Speaking of "Panzer Command" - thanks again for listing me as the original system designer, that means a great deal to me. Also, you've modified the system a little, but the additions seem quite logical to me.

--All in all, it's an amazing package and I predict it will be wildly successful. It does my heart good to see the "Panzer Command" system back in print and meeting its destiny. I always thought it was my most innovative design (the first "chit pick" game), but we made mistakes with it: wrong front (Russia is boring), terrible cover art (embarrassing really), and too small a game (you did it right).

I am eager to play the game and I'll probably write some kind of review of the game, at least for BoardGameGeek.com and perhaps for some other publication.

Best,

Eric

This is quite possibly the best monster-game ever made for a variety of reasons.  The system is perhaps the best ever designed for this scale, the graphical execution is top-notch, play is interactive and very tension-filled.  Best of all even the big scenarios campaign game can be played to conclusion in a very reasonable amount of time, compared to other large games.  Definitely a masterpiece and a very hard act to follow.

Not sure I can give a fair review to a HUGE, serious con-sim, but the rules in this are clear and smart. The chit activation system keeps you in a position where you're either capitalizing on gambits or desperately grasping.

I wanted to play a few times before offering an opinion.  I've been a battlefield tour guide for four years, and have traveled/researched the Market Garden area since 1993.  I must say the historical research is impressive; I also like the game mechanics.  A far better treatment than any SL/ASL-type game could do.  There's been much comment on the counters and map: for me, the maps are great, I don't need hexsides if facing of units isn't important (it's not).  As for the counters it's like art, one person's masterpiece is another's Kindergarten finger-painting.  Overall the counters are well-thought out to convey the maximum amount of information, and add some flavor to the game.  Having old eyes, I would've preferred some different color combinations, and more subdued watermarks.  The rulebook(s) are written much more informally than other games-I don't have a problem with this, neither should any other experienced wargamer who's used initiative chits.  I didn't see the "historical insights" that were supposed to be included with rulebooks-unless the special rules booklet stands for that statement.  The historical booklet could have been better, given the obvious research done for accurate units, deployments and  organization.

A beast of a game best played as indiv scens and not the campaign (unless you are unmarried and unemployed)!  I like the game scale Company sized units) that allows for better differentiation of units by homogeneous types without getting into the tactical unit complications of armor strengths by vehicle aspect etc.  The maps are top notch and the approach to only having hex vertices and not whole hex sides gives it a cleaner look.

RATING: N/A
This game looks great in a lot of ways and I have spent a lot of time researching it but it just doesn't appeal to me very much.  I am sure that it is a well designed and well researched wargame but the systems do not sound like they are to my taste and neither does the scale and subject matter.  Few of the ringing endorsements have struck a cord with me but several of the minor complaints have sounded like things I would find to be a big deal.  Ultimately, I can't justify $200 to find out.

EDIT:  three years later...  had a humorous moment.  I was looking over some wargames, and came across this, and said, why didn't I try that out?  Then I looked at the price, saw how expensive it was, and came to the determination I couldn't plot down $175 to find out if this is as good as it looks.  I go to write a comment, and realize I had the SAME thought process three years ago.  Funny...

RATING: 7
Good: Grand Tactical - WW II - Medium 

Very difficult to rate this beast. It's the ultimate simulation on Arnhem with great maps and counters but in it's execution I am not sure if it is my cup of tea. I had trouble with the rulebook and the additional guide was not to good either.
The same bias I had with the system; not bad but I was not overwhelmed either. Myabe I had too high hopes. 

Plus:
-Map; unsurpassed graphic design
-Theme: we have been waiting long for a new detailed game on the 'Market' operation. 
-Playable monster game: the bataljon/regimental size right here andit is both operational and tactical at the same time with a playable system that fits the size and scale.

Minus:
-I do not get warm with the system. A pitty but 
-Huge, maybe even too huge so a large time and space investment is required for larger scenario's. But hey, this is a monster game so no complaints here; you just should know what you are getting yourself into.
-The history booklet should have been given some extra attention. A nice touch but obviously not the care the game had.

A masterpiece as far as artwork is concerned. Market Garden fan should have in his collection. 
It is beautiful and it is massive and here lies a potential problem as well: requires heavy time investment & space although there are smaller scenario's. 

Unfortunately the real Montgomery and Model can't play this together. Would have been nice to have their feedback... 

I got an offer I could not refuse and decided to sell (I could buy 4 great other games on my wishlist).

As many have said, the maps are beautiful.  The game is fun, and the combat system is innovative.  The pacing took a little getting used to.  Several very playable scenarios are included, which is good because the campaign game is monstrous.

update - bumped my rating on this twice now.  I really like the system.  A friend and I have been playing the campaign via VASSAL.  I'm looking forward to playing Where Eagles Dare and No Question of Surrender.

The rating of 9 is for the campaign game (which is where the system really shines); none of the scenarios rate more than an 8 for me.

The chit pull and command system is very elegant and when combined with a combat system that captures the essence of tactical combat without the fuss of detailed armor and firepower calcualtions results in an accurate but quick playing game. Counter design provides info at to defence type, weapon type, quality, formation, etc at a glance Once I had started pushing counters around it was surprisingly easy to understand and play the rules. Game play is exciting and tense, a feels realistic/historically accurate...... This could be the holy grail of company level wargames!

It handles Arnhem and the Holland area better than anything I have experienced before!  The counters are fantastic will all the information I need and the maps are glorious!

The four-map campaign game and the individual one-map scenarios all work very well and the map is a work of art.

Very well supported by the developer, Nick Richardson, and the newly-produced index is particulary useful. I look forward to other games using the same system.

Pre-ordered,and the most expensive game I've ever pre-ordered!I have some confidence in this designer.It would be sensational to have a HTTR of sorts which doesn't suck.

Edit: Just received 7-18-08. I pre-ordered a long time ago (2 years, maybe....?), and I expected the credit card with which I ordered had likely expired, so I really wasn't expecting it. Even for the price, it was a nice surprise.

I imagine a lot of the '10' ratings are mostly for the components, along with goodwill toward the designer. It may be a great wargame, I just sort of doubt that very many have played it enough yet to judge. And this is definitely a game for wargamers, not the more general gaming crowd. The rules aren't all that imposing, but the sheer size of the game is (yes, I appreciate that there are smaller scenarios!). That said, the components *are* very impressive, and congratulations to everyone involved. The maps, while 'busy', are beautiful and detailed, as are the counters.

I have a couple of weeks off at the end of August, so hope to give this a try then, if not before. I really loved the Panzer Command system, it was one of my favorites for tactical games. A fair amount of chaos, which I think is a good thing at this scale.

Congrats to Adam and MMP for getting this thing out the door.

Edit: had this out again recently, and realized I hadn't rated it. I am giving it an 8, but for people thirsting for a big game on market garden, and have the space and time, it should be a 9 or 10. It's the best monster on this campaign that exists, to my knowledge. I have only played the smaller scenarios, but one day perhaps I'll have the space to try to set up the whole thing. 

Not too complicated or fiddly to play, which I think is key to this large of a game. It's actually fairly simple, albeit with a fair amount of chrome. The chit pull system keeps it relatively engaging for both (or all, if playing as a club) players. 

One more note on aesthetics: I love the maps. They are busy, for certain, but some of my favorite maps in a game, ever. Just beautiful, and you will really feel that you're in Holland. The counters to me are too busy - they'd probably be okay if there were no background watermarks, but the watermarks, at least on the darker counters, make them annoying to read. The lighter counters, such as the luftwaffe blue, are generally no problem. The rest of the package is top notch. This is an expensive game, by any measure, but MMP didn't skimp on anything. I'd love to get Where Eagles Dare - I hope to eventually, but it's a lot to shell out.

Opened my eyes to the "grand tactical" company-level wargame. The system does a fine job handling the myriad variables of the WWII battlespace, transforming them into a clean and playable game with plausible narratives. 

There are some quirks, of course: for example, I agree with Chris Farrell about Command Points, if available, too often making the Assault process (which is itself too cumbersome for my taste) too much of a mechanistic grind; or (another example), units adjacent to one another but sans the appropriate Formation chit in the mug (a common enough situation) are unable to fire without the expenditure of those same precious Command Points. Some of the scenario designs start to seem a bit liberal with the history when put under the microscope; the axis of attack for an entire German KG shifts in one, and in another the famous "Little Omaha" crossing transpires virtually unopposed. But quibbles aside, at a moment when an awful lot of WWII gaming consists of Yet Another Tactical Contender or series workhorses, TDC is undeniably exciting, ambitious, and fresh. 

Graphically, this package should sweep all of the awards. The series rule book is the one blemish among the components--it's usable but poorly conceived. Online support from the developer is already legendary, and deservedly so. Rating based on play of the scenarios, not the campaign. (And speaking of the scenarios, you owe it to yourself to try more than just the first two; the system doesn't really come alive until you're fighting across a full map and, especially, using the Dispatch points.)

Sorry to say, with my current group, this game will never hit the table.
I checked it out, love the components and maps, but with no chance of playing, its should go to someone who might actually get a play or two out of it.

The game was being prepped for play, and while the counters are unpunched, in prep for play they have been clear coat for further protection prior to punching them out. 

The box also has a small bow in the bottom from sitting on the shelf. It sat flat so I am not sure how the bow happened but it is small.

I have just built a bigger game table specifically for this plus two other games (1914 TitE and War of Resistance) so I can game out the full campaign.

RATING: 9
Downgraded to a 9:
Having played this more thoroughly, the biggest issue I have is how a lack of Dispatch points at the crucial time over 3-4 turns can screw up a large game. Statistically; if you have a division with a Dispatch rating of 3, you should receive 1+ points 40% of the time (on rolls of 0,1,2,3 out of 10). The probability however of any given rolled number on a D10 is the same: 10%. Great except I seem to roll ABOVE 3 on five or six consecutive turns, the division gets NO dispatch points and your offensive grinds to a halt for 10+ game hours. Kiss the campaign goodbye after 20+ hours of play. I do not mind losing battles/campaigns to my stupid choices or poor planning but destroying one because of a critical die-roll that occurs ONCE a turn per division can drive you bughouse NUTS. So:  House Rule (feel free to crib folks, no trademark here) A DIVISION GETS A MINIMUM OF 1 DISPATCH POINT EVERY SECOND TIME IT'S DIVISONAL CHIT GETS PULLED AND THE ROLL FAILS TO GIVE IT ONE.

Well done.  Arguably one of MMP's best productions.  A war gamer's dream on the Battle of Arnhem and Operation Market-Garden.  Quality components, well organized rules, scenarios and charts.  Beautiful maps.  Preorder takes the sting out of the retail price and I can't wait for the southern half (2nd game) of this series featuring the 101 airborne.

Simply stunning production.  I love the Panzer Command system and Market-Garden games.  Well-written rules, stunning maps, colorful counters, great scenarios (especially A Close Run Thing and A Bridge Too Far).  Hoping to experience the campaign scenario someday!  Scenarios are challenges for the attackers (as they should be), and a lot can ride on the rolls for dispatch points, as noted by Chris Farrell.  Have errata counters from Operations Special Issue #1.

RATING: 6
I usually like chit-draw systems and it is based on a solid game system from VG's old Panzer Command but while the original game was fun and manageable, I think this is too much of a good thing for me. I'm not a fan of "roll-a-bunch-of-dice" combat systems and that is what you get in the cityfights here. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground when it comes to the graphics either. They either knock you out or you cannot stand them. Actually, I like the graphics. 

It's not a bad game - actually, I quite enjoyed the times I have played it and I would play it again if given the opportunity. However, I don't think I would pay the prices this game goes for now nor am I so into the system that I'd want to preorder it either. Given that, I think a six seems to be a fair rating.

RATING: 7
Rating after one playing of a small scenario. Good game system and very nice components. Liked the color coding of different values and tables. Slightly too complex for me to want to play it much, but it would be fun to try a bigger campaign sometime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This could be a 10 for me, but not sure I'll push it that high only due to the large 'footprint' of the game.  Yes there are smaller scenarios that can make this a one-mapper, but I typically go for the campaign games over the scenarios so it is what it is.

Absolutely beautiful game in all respects. The only flaw for me, which cost it 0.5 points, is that I find the printing on some units, German units in particular, is so small as to be quite difficult to read.

A very engaging system with a nice level of detail that seems to be a winner in all categories.  The components are beautiful, especially the map.  The chit draw for activation adds some drama and it's nice that the division-level activation, while it can be large-scale, is restricted.  Command points allow for those extra actions just when you need them and are a fun addition.  The CRT elegantly combines multiple factors and I like the d10 for a broader range of results.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The city battles, especially in Arnhem, quickly degenerate into attritional battles of "roll a bucket of dice every turn, hope for as many zeroes as possible". And the results of the campaign hang on those battles. The systems feels that it would be far better in battles that were dominated maneuver warfare in open terrain rather than in infantry battles in claustrofobic terrain.

This game is incredibly beautiful, and its mechanics nifty, but I've realised that Market-Garden is just boring to me. I prefer the east front, I guess. Or a game which doesn't involve keeping a narrow road open or just capturing one bridge, unless it's really small like an ASL scenario.

A fabulous game to play and fascinating study of this part of the Market-Garden battle. Very big game - takes a lot of table space and time to play - but worth it if you are prepared to make the investment.

Played [i]Little Omaha[/i] - a 2-turn mini-scenario.  I like the activation chit system as it nicely randomizes who does what.  The command point system also nicely limits doing too much.  The unit design is very nice as are the tables.  Everything is there loading a lot of information into a compact system.  Scenarios offer a nice range from small to large making for a great range of possible gaming options.

RATING: 6
Edit: Rating increased from 4 to 6 based on 20 hours play of campaign game 1. Still not convinced it's as good as its ranking, but it's good enough to play again. 

Still stand by my original comments, though

===============

A bit disappointing at first glance. The counters are grossly over done, to the point where they detract from their primary function of conveying information. The maps are pretty nice, especially the idea of backprinting for single map scenarios. Overall though, in its graphics the game comes a very poor second to its only real peer, Streets of Stalingrad.

I found typos / garbled English on the first page of BOTH rulebooks, which does not bode well. 

The designers have made great play of the historical insights packed into the game, but I have to say they are not easy to find. The game's historical booklet is banal, and the game system itself seems to be a pretty tired retread of systems already 20 years old. And where's the Corps Command level?

Finally, reading descriptions of the game in play, it seems just that - gamey. Now, for many that's not a problem, nor is it a problem for me. But in a $180 game which trumpets its historicity, it's a pretty disappointing outcome. 

Of course, my rating may change if I ever play it :)

Finally a moster game that seems esay to play. Clearly rules, fluid and intuitive sequence of play.

Marvellous map and very good counters. I always love chit mechanic because confers a unique variety of plays.
So the addiction of command and dispatch point is further and welcome addiction.

within a week we start to manage entire campaign.

Down to a 7 after six month of playing of campaign game, some rules are really hard to digest (one overall the horrible german route rule)

  For me TDC is the best Grand Tactical game ever developed, for several reasons.  First the scenarios actually reflect well the historical facts of the battle, (something other games I've played struggled to do).
 Second: I think its one of the most playable monster games from the ease of the system---this is a very playable game, even for those who dislike complexity in their games.
 There is a lot there, and the rules in my view are logical and the examples for the most part are well presented.   The graphic art by Niko is some of the best I've ever seen and every time I lay the maps and counters out on my table I'm reminded of what a good looking game this is...one of the best without a doubt.   Adam Starkweather hit a homer with TDC and I'm sure following games in the system will measure up as well.

Outstanding Monster Wargame!  Slight decrease IMHO due to way rules are written - not a fan of the chatty style.  Otherwise a great game with multiple levels of play and chit pull activation mechanics lends itself well for replay value.  Game flow works extremely well for PBEM with the excellent Vassal module.

One of the best games I've ever played, with the worst Rules ever written. I'm not saying that the rules are bad, in fact, rules are very beautiful. The problem is the setting of the book of rules, based on a system of "questions & answers" that presents an enormous duplication and difficulties in finding the rule sought in less time.

I bought this for a steal at a (not so) local games convention (Newbury Colours - Oct 08). The price was SO good, I couldn't not buy it.
Heavens forbid if I ever take the time to start to learn how to play - I would be consumed by its enormity - least, that's my excuse for leaving it on the shelf (for now)... I... must... resist...

After playing a handful of the scenarios, I am enjoying this game more than I thought I would.  And I had high expectations for the money spent.

The series rules are simple and work very well.  The TDC specific rules add just the right amount of chrome to get the feel for the Devil's Cauldron.  Highlights include raised roads, assault ferries, bridges, paradrops, glider landings, etc.

Also there are 4 ways to play the CG, historically as well as with different amounts of variability in deployments and drop zones.

The components are high quality.

As a game it is very intense.

RATING: 6.5
I have mixed feelings on this one. It's a neat game, with a lot of strengths but also some real weaknesses. I enjoy it. But it's also extremely expensive and thus a little harder to be forgiving of its faults. Overall, I can't help but feel that a significant part of its popularity is more about ogling the pretty counters and/or bandwagon-riding than it is about gameplay and history.

The Good - the map is innovative, beautiful, and functional. The play aids and rules are well-produced. The system plays quickly and mostly very intuitively, with a minimum number of chart and DRM lookups. Command and control issues are modelled effectively and efficiently. Especially for long games (big scenarios and the campaign), the system is such that the narrative keeps moving and you don't get bogged down in uninteresting details. Online support by developer Nick Richardson is simply phenomenal. Overall, there are lots of really good things here.

The Bad - First and most importantly, the small-to-medium scenarios really don't play well. While I don't feel quite as strongly as Chris does here, his reasons are dead-on. Certain elements of the system (the last chit pulled and Dispatch Points especially) are *extremely* swingy in the short term. In a 3-4 turn scenario, losing a Dispatch Point or missing a key activation can hugely tilt the balance in one player's favor and there's no way to mitigate that besides flat-out fudging rolls. This also affects the Campaign Game, where the quality of Allied die rolls in the first few hours will cast a long shadow over the rest of the game. To some extent, this reflects how precarious an operation Market-Garden was and isn't simply a design flaw. But it does make me more hesitant about investing my limited play time in the game. Second, the counter art and graphics in general are overdone - drop the watermarks, lose the German unit symbols, and just make them functional, please. I like a good-looking game as much as the next guy, but I don't care for the way this title has made graphic presentation such a focus of the product. Ultimately, what matters is that the game plays well. In a similar vein, I can barely pencil in errata in the rulebook because it's done up in slick, glossy paper that doesn't take marks well. Very impressive looking, but not very functional. I have some other reservations about specific mechanics, scenario design, rules style, and other graphical issues as well. Apart from my issue with the scenarios, none of these things are any more than petty annoyances. But there are a lot of them.

Overall, I'm really torn about this game. I enjoy playing it and will continue to do so. But half the scenarios in it aren't worth the trouble of playing seriously, it's full of minor graphical/stylistic annoyances, and it's *really* expensive. I'm not at all convinced there's four to five times the fun here as there is in multiple smaller titles, despite how smashing the game looks in photos.

Beautiful looking game. Going throught he rules and am looking forward to my 1st game. The only issue is that during shipping the box got damage, the front cover of the rules got creased and a page in the historical notes got ripped. This is not a fault with MMP but with shipping. Sometimes I think they kicked the boxes all the way and for the last block load them into a truck.

This is a very engrossing system. Not overly complex but thoroughly engaging. To win you really need to understand how each of the game elements interact. I've read a significant number of books on the Arnhem campaign and this game really showcases the tactical problems faced by both sides during the battle. Now played most of the scenarios, some of the beginner secretaries several times. The game definitely suits the larger scenarios although the smaller scenarios are good for honing the game playing skills needed in the larger games. Still one of my favourite systems.

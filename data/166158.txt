Light VP card game based around fairy tales.  Not a bad filler
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Neat filler with marvelous art. Relatively easy to play, but not devoid of strategy. One downside is that despite being a filler, there are a lot of cards to remember, so the first few games will be 3-4 times longer than necessary. I've seen people fall into analysis paralysis mode while playing this on multiple occasions.

RATING: 3
Given the beautiful artwork and components, I wish this was a better game. I think if I got to work with a couple of friends we could produce a better game that would do justice to this stunning artwork and theme. A massive disappointment that simply draws and plays itself. There are simply much better ways to spend your money and time.

Dark Tales is a card game that at first seems rather simple. But there is a fair bit of tactics and strategy involved with how you play the cards and also to where they have to be played. cards played in front of you give bonuses while cards played into a center display offer instant effects as well as the chance to gain benefits in the future. Cards collect into sets that might have future advantages to one or all players as well. each game you play has a card drawn that gives you a way to score points during the game. As well as a card for end game scoring. With these you have some variability from game to game. The art is fantastic and some of the best I've seen for such a small game. If you're looking for theme though you won't find it here as it is pretty well pasted on. But what you will find is a game that is fun to play and gorgeous to look at.

RATING: 7.9
This is a surprisingly solid card game, in which you use two Setting cards to establish rules for how you'll use various item tokens, and to affect scoring at the end. The actions are simple...draw a card, play an item, play a card. So it's simple to teach, with only a few icons, and there is some variation due to those Settings. Artwork is also good.

RATING: 6
Quite nice card game with great art, but it seems to me that you don't have so much choises to make or combinations to do (what I personally search in a card game like this). 
Probably it would be better with the expansions, but the main game alone is a bit linear...

Card effects upon card effects. A fun ride, and combo galore.

RATING: 8
One of my favorites. Gorgeous artwork, interesting strategies and card combos, and the expansions add a lot of variety, really keeping the game fresh. Keeping track of points is a bit fiddly, since you get points for playing cards, occasionally for card effects, and also sometimes have cards that have lingering abilities if you control them. I'd recommend an app, or dial system for it, instead of the point tokens, and once you get used to picking up your points, it's not difficult at all, just have to get in the habit of doing so as you play. Would definitely recommend!

I played this game with 2 expansion Red Riding Hood and Snow White and it is a fun game.  It's not to brain burny and it will not set the world on fire but the art work is fantastic imo and you can pull off a few combos.  I really like it.  It's a good filler game.  I only played it with 2 players.   I have the Mermaid expansion also and I am planning on playing that tonight.

Ok card management game from a designer I like. The game works fine and is absolutely fine for a short game, but it's nothing more than that.

You just draw and play cards (which is completely luck driven), get ressources and use them to get more points, simple as that.

Very simple card game that involves some set collection and scoring that is randomly determined at the beginning of the game. Feels like you're writing a story while playing. There's a bit of strategy involved sometimes around switching between day and night and when to play certain cards but overall there isn't huge depth to the strategy.

Dark Tales has the classic "draw a card, play a card" mechanism with ongoing effects, instantaneous cards, and cards that went into a common area that other cards would play off of. The coolest mechanism of the game was that you could switch between Night and Day, which would modify the cards that you could play.

I got lucky and drew a pair of cards in my starting hand that would give me 2 points during the day and 2 points during the night. So I was automatically getting 2 points every day. Combined with some crazy combos, I ended up winning pretty substantially (38-22-18-13).

I was not a fan of this game overall. I thought that there was too much randomness with what you could draw and not enough ways to cycle through the cards on your turn. There were also tokens (Magic Wand- Draw Cards, Armor- Defend against attacks, Sword- Attack people) that you could get, but they were almost never used. Only Laurie and I each used one magic wand, and we had to waste a card to do it, so we basically just punted a turn at one point. I think they had some good ideas in there, but there wasn't very much flexibility in your play, and it was overly complicated for what it was.

An interesting little game, but nothing very original. It feels a lot like a Seiji Kanai game in that the card abilities are fairly intuitive, and the rules overhead is very small. The game does go on a touch too long for my tastes, and I worry a bit about the replay value, but it's not bad for something offbeat and different.

Érdekes játék, ahol egy tündérmesében veszünk részt. Egy meglehetősen sötét hangulatú tündérmesében. A játék nem rossz, de nincsen benne igazán semmi extra. Ha magyarul is lenne, ráadásul rögtön Hófehérkés kiegészítővel együtt, akkor azt hiszem, hogy beszerzeznék belőle egy példányt.

RATING: 5
The main problem with this game is that is so fast that you almost never have the chance to build any kind of successful or diverse strategy with it. The best you can do is play the card that net you the most points at the moment (which are usually around 4), before someone play something that may screw it up, or any card that allow you to draw more cards, to try and get more options. While sometimes a particularly good combo can be set up, you got equal chances for it to fall naturally in your lap, or otherwise to never get the cards you would need to.  In it's basic form, the game is almost completely random, but i guess that the expansions may kinda fix it by adding more cards as fuel for the various available combos, and more turns (the game ends mostly when the draw deck is depleted) to try and get advantage of them.

When a game puts this much effort into how good it looks with non-standard card size and big pictures you might start to suspect it doesn't have anything else to offer in terms of gameplay. Your suspicion would be right.
Basically you just have to count to four to see which of your card will give you a bit more points. Endless administration of point tokens and then count them. No, thanks.

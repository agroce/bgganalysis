I have had the luck to demo Fate of the Elder Gods twice now and it compares well with Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu and the Arkham Horror Card Game which I have also demoed recently. 
Fate of the Elder Gods has certain advantages over those other titles: 
+  It has considerably more player interaction. No 4 player solitaire here! 
+ The game play is more dynamic despite lightning fast player turns. 
+ The game board is drop dead gorgeous!
+ Innovative mechanics - the interaction of the Astral Column with spell casting and Curses (crossroads) are my favorite. 
+ And finally more dice! Dice rolling with the randomness mitigated by Artifact abilities.
All this with only the base game! A Monster expansion entitled 'Beasts from Beyond' will be included with a basic pledge if the SG is met. Don't miss out!

Takes 30+ min to teach.  First 3 player game was 4.5 hours solid.  A 30 - 90 min play time is bogus.  However, it is such fun we did not care it took so long.  =D  We're all looking forward to the next game.

Not so good. I actually gave my copy away after the first play to a friend. Great components with detailed minis, a cool theme, and some thick cardboard counters and nicely printed boards. Unfortunately it didn't come together as a fun game.

Gameplay was a mix of area majority with your cultists to fire off primary and secondary abilities from these locations, which took some getting used to figuring out what they do and how they benefited us. The game got better after a few turns but then just didn't hold our attention as it got more and more randomas some players got lucky rolls, spell card draws and we had a huge runaway leader problem. The issue was that it was too rare and slow to get a VP, and random things popping up in the game to give more VP to a random person was ruining it for us. didn't feel like I was in control of my destiny at all.

Had the amazing opportunity to learn and play the prototype this past weekend with Chris Kirkman himself. This thing has a beautiful board, box, artwork and components, so the presence on the table was very eye catching and unique. The game play was a mix of hand management & worker placement but was fast paced with 4 players. The wife and I are really looking forward to this coming out and hitting the table on the regular for (hopefully) years to come!

Backed on Kickstarter, expected delivery May 2017. Arrived Aug 2017. 

Each player controls a cult (with different powers) trying to summon their big bad. You will place cultist out on the board to take control of actions to further this goal. All the while investigators and curses from spells get in your way. I really enjoy the game play and it is nice to play a Lovecraft themed game that isn't just another flavor of FFG. The first play took a little bit to grok since each move has a few steps, but overall it is not hard once you've got it down, and the player aid clearly spells out what you need to do. The art and minis are amazing. There is some luck, and it requires some thought to figure out how to set up your actions efficiently, but even when it is a chaotic mess I've had fun with it.

I played a four player and two player game with the near-final prototype. The unique abilities of each elder god really mixes up the strategies and makes you approach the game differently each time. This variable play, mixed with a solid core of mechanics and an epic end game, makes Fate of the Elder Gods a great game.

There is much to like here. On one hand, strategic decisions are very involved, as you need to think multiple turns in advance to play well, seeding both your lodge and the board with cards and trying to predict opponents' moves. On the other hand, the game is very tactical, changing your decision space every time you draw cards or see what other players put down.

However, the limited board means you do often feel like you're doing the same few things over and over again, and since there is quite a bit of luck in the game, turns can be frustrating if you can't move where you need to (or can't play the spell you want). The "take that" elements, though pervasive, don't bother me here as much as they might in other games, partially because the game is so tactical, but also because you deal out what you receive.

Had the chance to play the game at Gen Con and the great is just really great at look at even though I'm not of fan of the Cthulhu genre. The artwork is fantastic and the miniatures really neat, even though I wish they were slightly different from player to player. I really enjoyed the special powers of each ancient to add some variability. The game also has an interesting movement mechanism where you can only move to certain actions spaces based on the spell type available. The main problem with the game is that it really dragged in the beginning. Perhaps it was because we were all new players but it really took the game a long time to "get going" and lost a bit of interest along the way. I would still recommend it for Cthulhu fans.

I have played a bunch of Cthulhu themed games and this one is BY FAR the best.  You play as the cultists of one of a wide variety of elder gods trying to awaken your god first.  You do this by utilizing a clever action selection system coupled with area control and hand management that boosts your actions and allows you to cast powerful spells.  Investigators stand in your way along with the other players (cultists) and the AWESOMELY FUN curse cards that are triggered based on a condition known only to the player to your right.  Super fun game.  A lot going on but simple to learn.

This game is a wonderful mix of simple, elegant Euro mechanisms, and Lovecraft theme.  It is simple to play, but out of that there is quite a bit of emergent gameplay.  Your Elder God powers, spells, and artifacts can all lead to a very different game state, including an important question of what victory condition to strive for, and when you switch.

Plus, beautiful artwork and gorgeous production.  A new classic.

In Fate of the Elder Gods, players take on the ever-maddening role of cults trying to summon ancient evil and herald the fall of mankind! Each cult is in competition to be first to summon their god, but they all must also repel intrepid investigators working to seal off the gate to beyond with Elder signs. Gather arcane artifacts, cast powerful spells, embrace the Dark Gift of your Elder God, and be first to hasten doom...before it's too late!

During the game, players use a variable hand of spell cards to do one of two things to aid their cult in their mission: Use the spell's Astral Symbol to navigate the areas around Arkham on the unique Fate Clock board, or use the symbols in a location's Astral Column to ready a spell. Readied spells can be cast at any time, but while in a cult's Spell Reserve their primary Astral Symbol can aid in readying future spells, creating an engine for pumping out more potential power.

As cults travel to the six locations on the Fate Clock, they activate specific powerful abilities, such as gaining useful artifacts at The Museum or enabling their Elder God's Dark Gift at The Ceremony. As cults send more and more cultists to a location, they may gain control there, adding even more powerful abilities. However, cults must be careful how they navigate Arkham as a location with lots of activity will attract pesky investigators. Tempt fate too many times and the investigators may raid your cult's lodge, placing Elder Signs, and generally getting in the way of summoning your Elder God. Gain too many Elder Signs and it's game over!

If any cult can manage to raise their Summon Track to 9 before the investigators save humanity, their Elder God awakens and they win! Of course, "win" is a relative term as it will certainly herald the end of the world — but that's a small price to pay for eternal servitude to the Ancient Ones.

Nagyon jó mechanikákat sikerült kitalálni ehhez a játékhoz, ráadásul a kedvenc megközelítésemmel: valami egyszerűbb mechanikára építsünk olyan összefüggéseket, hogy az ember agya belegebedjen. :)
Tetszik a téma is, a grafika is, a minik se rosszak. Viszont iszonyatosan kitolós, balanszolós játék, nomeg nem kicsi a szerepe a szerencsének se. Igazából sose értettem teljesen, hogy ezek a nagyon ameri-euro hibridek kiknek szólnak. Az ameriseknek szerintem ez túl sok agyalás, az eurós meg infarktust kap ennyi szerencsén, kitoláson. Ha valaki pont ilyesmire vágyik, akkor viszont nagyon ajánlott. Egyedül talán az átkok egyensúlya nem lett tökéletes. Vannak nagyon fájdalmasak, de olyan is, amik nem sokat befolyásolnak, azokról nem is beszélve, amiket szinte képtelenség triggerelni. Ezen a részen lehetett volna még kicsit dolgozni.

[b]About this review[/b]

[i]This review is a design critique from the perspective of a group of boardgame designers. If instead you want to get more of an overview of the components of the game, gameplay, etc., you may want to read some of the other reviews first.

For reference, the game is currently at 7.7 with 73 ratings as I write this. However, to be transparent, the following review is on the balance negative, but there are a number of positive aspects to the game that I don't want to disparage, nor minimize the incredible amount of heart that went into it by the designers. I did rate the game a 6.9, which is not bad, but I didn't enjoy it much, and I try to explain below where I think the design could be better.

Also in the interest of transparency, my group played the game just once (so far) with 4 players. While some people might take issue with a review after a single play—especially a negative one—I'd respond that IMHO there is a place for reviews after a single play, as well as for reviews after multiple plays. These serve different purposes, and I believe that first impressions are indeed important and capture something that more experienced players (and designers) may miss.

Despite my feeling that such a review is fair game, I also stipulate that it can't easily capture the subtle depths in a design, nor necessarily give full credit for the tremendous amount of hard work and iteration that goes into it. If you feel that this first-play review misses the mark, please post a counterpoint review to balance out these perspectives. My hope is that even if you disagree with the following critique, you hopefully won't find it naive.[/i]

[b]Analysis and Critique[/b]

Although I generally like to start with all the things that worked well in a design, in this case, I want to jump right into the meat of it: Fate of the Elder Gods is a convoluted and fiddly design, and at its heart pretty abstract despite a reasonably thick veneer of theme.

There are some excellent parts to the game, but it was not really what I thought it was going to be. I would never consider my misperceptions to be a knock on a game, but similar to Scythe, I feel it purports to be something it really isn't. That's OK, but it was jarring.

Case in point: Despite loads of cultist minis and city locations in which to place them, area control is a very minor element of the game. When taking an action, majority control of a location only guarantees taking an extended "control" version of the main action vs a 1/6 chance otherwise.

The game is more properly a limited worker placement game. Instead of dominating an area, cultists are mainly resources used for powering certain actions and spells that accumulate on each potential action.

This is fine and all, but might as well have called them resources and actions. Furthermore, as someone else pointed out in our group, the whole base vs control action mechanism could've been left out, taking a bunch of fiddly, hard-to-remember mechanisms with it, like the arbitrary minimum threshold for control (3 cultists), and yet another way of rolling success on the multi-use dice. There aren't a huge deal, but add to the cognitive burden.

On top of the complication of the control mechanism itself, the fact that the control action explanation is only available on the reference card was pretty frustrating, and it required us to constantly refer to them in order to plan our turns. It feels like this game was a bit "ingrown", in that the designers were too far inside the curse of knowledge to understand the usability problems mechanisms like these present. I personally feel this mechanism could've been done better and more simply without really affecting the core design.

But there are bigger issues with the design than these minor quibbles, namely the spell-readying mechanism. This mechanism entirely depends on what is effectively a random accumulation of cards on a location (an "Astral Column"), followed by the requirement to take the action at a location, a capability which is also dominated by random card draws.

While I am intrigued by a mechanism that uses multiple accumulating card types forming combinations that can be utilized by players, it is undermined by the general difficulty of moving to that location in order to take advantage of it. It is this movement mechanism that is most difficult to control and plan out, and given its primacy in the game, that's hard to swallow.

I found I really resented the action selection being coupled with spell readiness, and felt it was needlessly convoluted, mostly for the sake of driving seemingly important yet generally non-consequential choices. Given that I had to use my few spell cards in hand to direct my action selection, and gaining those cards was random, plus they were also spells I wanted to ready—it was quite difficult to actually do what I preferred to do on my turn. Couple this with the uncertainty of the player to my right potentially blocking my action, as well as the largely uncertain buildup of investigators which could cause a raid, and it all adds up to frustration.

So, in the end, I felt the ability to carry out an action deliberately was pretty limited. Based on the rest of the design, which is very interactive (i.e. stabby), I see that it would be hard to balance without these significant action-limiting mechanisms. But, the overall effect of these limiting mechanisms is that the game play is very opportunistic, even more so than a typical worker placement game with action blocking (e.g. Agricola).

For these reasons, the ratio of decision making felt low compared to juggling short-term context and wrangling with fiddly mechanisms. I just don't remember consistently making really consequential decisions, though I was able to opportunistically get in a couple of very nice moves. That I was able to see them through all the convoluted mechanisms was a skill that might improve with multiple plays, but felt more fortuitous than strategic.

[b]Other Impressions[/b]

Having said all of the above, one member of our group liked it a lot, and I generally value his opinion over mine. :) He made an excellent point about the strong asymmetry of the different cults and the potential interactions between their powers. I also feel like this was the best part of the design, along with the large amount of variability in the spells and curses. I felt that these elements were certainly well-thought-out and designed by a very experienced hand. Impressive. And as I also said above, there is more than just a pasted-on theme here.

The ultimate problem, though, is that the game doesn't much feel like I'm leading a cult making evil, fiendish plans to bring about the end of the world. It felt more like a bunch of lackeys with impulse control problems running around doing whatever was low-hanging fruit. :P

Despite the good use of theme, it felt like a very abstract design at its core. I would have preferred a game like this to be designed from the perspective of what it would feel like to be in such a cult rather than getting caught up in mechanisms, but it seems like that holy grail is yet to come.

I'm sure my negative impressions would improve with experience, but even then I wonder how much decision space there would really be for strategic play. To be fair, much of the information is known to players and could in theory be taken into account strategically, like which spells other players have and thus what they are more likely to do on their turn. But this information is buried under a mass of mechanisms that in the end give only limited control. So even if you could know or predict with certainty what other players might do, you wouldn't have a lot of options to make effective use of the information.

On the plus side, when I was able to pull off a couple of dastardly moves, it was satisfying. (For instance, I was able to cause a raid on everyone yet ignore 5 Elder Signs on me.) The game ended by one player gaining too many Elder Signs, so that wasn't ideal, but was also put in motion by a lot of the interactive features, which for the right players would be appreciated.

[b]Production[/b]

I want to especially call out the excellent production work done on the game; something I'd like to see with more games in the future, and hopefully not only a by-product of the game's overfunding on Kickstarter.

For example, both sides of the telescoping box are lined with black art paper (finally!), and the game uses black-core token stock throughout, which is awesome. There is not one bit of grey, recycled, lifeless pressboard to be found anywhere, and once you see it, it will make you totally miss it in other games. 

Also, the pre-shaded minis look noticeably better than other games, despite some blemishes and pooling. The art and graphic design are also excellent and very thematic. All modern hobby games should be this well-produced, so big thumbs up to the team.

Despite this, there were a couple of minor misses: as is unfortunately common, the card wells were about 2-3mm too shallow, despite there being room below the insert, so the cards slide out of their wells easily when the box is turned. And there isn't enough room for all the components to fit neatly in the provided insert. I would've much rather had more space for components and a cardboard token for the 2-player/solo variant than a second Cthulhu mini. But that is subjective; the minis are indeed nice.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

In conclusion, Fate of the Elder Gods is not a bad design, but it has some flaws and I didn't enjoy it a great deal. Yet I would play it again to see how much the fiddliness drops away and the core of the design shines though. The game was clearly designed by competent, capable, and experienced designers who put their hearts into it, and that deserves a great deal of respect no matter what. Making games is not easy, and this is certainly not a lazy nor mindless design.

I'd suggest that if you like conceptual, abstract designs like Carl Chudyk's, are comfortable being precise in tracking game phases and turn progressions, and/or enjoy immersion in the Lovecraftian Mythos, you would be OK with this game. But certainly don't bring this game out to play with novices or gamers who are more experienced with lighter games; it likely won't be something they'd enjoy, and you will spend most of your time babysitting them through the convoluted turn structure.

RATING: 5
I wasn't too eager to play this, but ended up playing it anyway in a 4-player game. The game was taught very well, so that wasn't the problem. In a game where people are going at a regular pace, it just takes way too long and there's never a feeling of doing anything but being subjected to the "fate" of the cards you are dealt and playing them effectively. I wanted it to end sooner than later. The game just takes way too long for what you're really doing. It reminds me of Betrayal at House on the Hill. I enjoy some longer and heavier games, so it's not that. 

I was first in player order and I ended up winning, so it wasn't bad circumstances for me. I just never felt that I was doing anything significant in this game. 

I wouldn't want to play this again willingly, but I would not veto it if others want to play. The production value is very good in this game as well. 

Just take the score literally. It's average and I go by the BGG comment of "take it or leave it". I just cannot make a positive judgment about it.

Not a bad game, but not a particularly good one either. I can't see ever requesting to play this.  Fate of the Elder Gods suffers from some "take that" and king-making problems as the leader can just get blocked and hammered.  The random artifacts are interesting, but some are much more powerful than others.

RATING: 8
I am not a spell-casting kinda gamer.  This is a heavier game so it took me about half the game to figure out what was going on, but once I got the hang of it, I was surprised to discover I actually liked it.  

There are six locations on the board that your Cult member can travel to, each offering them a special ability for that turn.  Each cult has its own unique ability (your dark gift) that makes one location more powerful for you.  You are attempting to collect 9 summons to win.  Your opponents are attempting to give you 10 elder signs by filling your lodge with Investigators so that you would lose.  If a player loses with 10 elder signs, the winner is the player with the least elder signs.  This a tremendous bash the leader mechanic.                                                                                            

The summons and elder signs create a tug of war.  One or two players will try to win by having the most summons.  One or two players will try to win by having the least elder signs and giving the most elder signs to the leaders.  Because of players dark gifts, you know where they are likely to go, so you can seed those areas with Investigators.

I don't think I need to own this, but I am definitely looking forward to playing it again.

It’s not a bad design, and I did enjoy it the more I played.  My major objection is that there are lots of little cards with large amounts of text, many of which must be remembered by the players to spring at the right moment.  I’d rather the totality of the board tell the tale rather than having to recall what is temporarily hidden.  I could see how for a certain type of gamer this would be a 10, and I might have been that guy about seven years ago, but now I’m not.

Fate of the Elder Gods is a nice looking game with great components in the Cthulhu theme. It's a bit slow at the start, then gets very chaotic and random and yet, keeps on going and overstays its welcome by a good 30-60 minutes. If this was really a hour long game it would be much more enjoyable.

An excellent game with really unique mechanics, a good amount of player interaction, and nice looking art and components. The gameplay mechanisms are kind of obtuse at first (partly because they are so fresh), but once it clicks they actually make a lot of sense and make for some really interesting decisions in trying to balance discarding spells, readying spells, managing investigators, managing cultists on the board, managing cultists in your lodge, summoning your elder god, and managing elder signs. You can't deal with all of these issues at once, so what do you prioritize on any given turn? Not my typical style of gameplay, but I really enjoyed it. Top notch game. Highly recommend.

Cancelled. The game is broken by the STREETS OF ARKHAM area. Completely, really... There is no sense in making any other move (not even spells or artifacts required...)
+ It's totally bloathed any way.
Aaah and the dice rolling! (quantity AND quality) Oh dear...

Fantastic production, but I was really surprised at how Euro this felt for a Richard Launius game. It didn't really feel like his design at all. The game itself is fine, though my tastes for cube-pushers has dwindled significantly as of late. I almost want to cannibalize the miniatures from this game though. They're worth the price, if nothing else.

Kickstarted 8/2016

Played my copy for the first time in 8/2017. Love the game, a lot of "take that" action which I and my group tend to avoid, but it fits this game nicely. A lot of cards with words but they're easy to read. I'm confident that gameplay speed will only improve with another play. Within the first play I could see player turns going faster and faster. Might try and pick something to hold the spell cards up so I can read them when they're cast as it's a little annoying to constantly be picking them up to remember what I have. Still, great game and one I'll be playing more and more.

One of my favorite area control games for 2 after just a couple plays.  That may make my rating come across suspect, but what I really enjoyed about the game was how area control was important, but could be overcome even if you were outnumbered.  Area control helped you achieve your goals, but was not simply your goal.  The Cthulhu theme almost always hits with me and I am glad I picked this up.  Area control is not usually our favorite mechanism, but this game passes the test.

I backed this game on Kickstarter and received it together with its expansion. Quality of the game components is great, but the gameplay itself was really bad. One of the few games in the past 10 years that my gaming group did not finish because we really did not like it. Everything (movement, spells, artifacts, dice, ...) felt way too random and that didn't make the game fun (for us).

RATING: 6
Really strong attention to the theme in the game. 

Game play is fairly simple, move play the power and then done. Certainly helps if you get a lot of spells readied so you can deal with some situations that come up.

Just a little, well, boring.

Best part of the game are the curses, seemingly random events that can mess up your turns.

First, the production quality is AWESOME and the game looks marvelous. Each Elder Gods' Dark Gifts and abilities REALLY change each player's gaming experience and there's already a lot of variety in the core box. Since this game definitely has a learning curve for casual players, the timeframe really depends of the number of players and their level of experience with the game. The amount of information and variables to keep track of for a new player may seem overwhelming and trigger analysis paralysis... not to mention you might need a FAQ handy to clarify some Spell cards. However, once used to the game, I'd say it's about 20-30 minutes per player.

The solo play didn't quite convinced me as there are fundamental flaws associated with some Spells and Dark Gifts... and it's just too easy overall. The 2-player is very strategic and you really need to check everything your opponent does or plans. The 3-player experience is more open (move flexibility due to only one Fate Piece), but the number of elements to keep track of really increase, as well as the number of Raids, Curses and bad stuff being thrown around. However, it also allows the game mechanics and Dark Gifts to shine better. In a 2-player game, one can take the lead and advance unpunished if the opponent is in no position to hurt; in a 3-4-player game, if one player takes the lead, he also really gets the heat from others!

Overall, this is not a perfect game, but definitely a GREAT game that I look forward to playing again!

Didn't mind this, but for me the piles of miniatures (nice though they were) crowded onto the board were not easy to read, and put me off. Having too many cards (of various types and sizes - spells, artifacts, curses, etc.) in front of me at once - many of them face down - and having to remember all of them is tedious and a problem for me. I like the dual win/lose conditions, although all players being able to cast all their spells at any time really lets all players pile on the punishment on the one lead player all at once and cause massive swings. Aren't people getting tired of Lovecraft-themed board games yet?

Waaaay too long. It's just too difficult to advance the game state in a direction that helps you, especially if other players are engaging in the myriad of take-that the game provides. Which they will be, because it's much easier to win by screwing everyone else over than actually progressing.

We've only played once so far, but we enjoyed it quite a bit. The resource management aspect with the spells is quite interesting...and we liked that spells had several functions in the game. It can take a few rounds to be comfortable with the locations' functions but after you've gotten used to them, play picks up considerably.

I had high hopes for this game, but I was left disappointed. The game is very fiddly - there are easily-forgotten rules, and a lot of tiny face-down cards to keep track of. Despite the complexity, there didn't seem to be a lot of depth, due to the large amount of randomness and "take that" mechanisms. The winner seemed to be the player who happened to be targeted the least.

It seems thematically appropriate that the invoking of an elder god should be convoluted, risky, and infuriating, and that's what Fate of the Elder Gods often is. It's also nicely confrontational and a whole lot of fun in spite of some considerable flaws.

Clever and thematic game. This is an area control game that if you like Cthulhu, you will love this game. It is a tense game with the clever mechanism of Curses (taken form Dead of Winter and implemented here better). Components are top notch and art is great. Highly recommended. It is a long game (4 players about 3 hrs with rule explanations).

Great game. Sacrificing your players should be as staple in every game. I get really tired of the Cthulhu and his friends the Elder Gods theme that a hundred board games seem to be spewing out now a days, but this one seemed to flavor the entire thing well. You sacrifice your people to do stuff and you summon your God.

Only one play so far, definitely felt like a learning game.  I really enjoyed the feel of it though.  Feels very unique and devious.  Nice to see that sort of Dead of Winter card concept used in a (possibly) better way.  The game is full with take-that, so fair warning.

On the one hand, I love the production and theme. I think idea of elder signs and summoning and monsters and cultists comes through very strongly. Nice to have the asymmetrical cults, too.

The gameplay is a mix of action selection, hand management, area majority and some dice rolling. It took a decent while to understand the inter-relationship of the different altar locations and how they could produce end-game benefits. After a few turns, it got better.

Some of the curses, dice rolling and blind drawing of spell cards make the game pretty random at points. There are certainly times where pushing things too much will result in problems for you, but there are times where a specific curse will just screw you up big time (I say this even though I won my first play).

Also found the process of turns and the policing required in the game to be way too fiddly. Even with an experienced teacher, I found there were too many instances of turn rewinds and people going "Wait, you had this curse/spell/power/dice, so..."

I guess I "kind" of liked it, but I'd probably need to play it more to really see how the systems feel over prolonged play.

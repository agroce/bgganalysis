A nice expansion on the base game.  More players = more craziness and fun!  Scales pretty well up to 8, even with it being player elimination.

RATING: 6.6
Red Dragon Inn 2 is a game which expands its first episode.  What is interesting is that, the game can be played as a set alone or can be used to expand the first set so as to take in 8 players.  Gameplay is similar for both sets of games but different characters may produce different effects to the game.

Good points: Like the idea of the expansion set able to play as a standalone game which I have not come across any other games that are able to do it.

Bad points: Though it is a good idea to be able to play the expansion set as a standalone game, the game should introduce some additional elements into the game and make the game more interesting.  The expansion is the replica of the original game with additional characters.

After thought: Tried playing this game with 8 players in a game.  The luck factor in the game with more players playing is higher than I thought.  Players can be knock out of the game way before their turn.

A good expansion to RDI 1, but not as fun to play as a stand-alone game: the characters here aren't iconic enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I see the RDI series in the same way I see Munchkin: cute humor, and probably alright if you also want to have a few beers while playing, but limited strategy and with a significant kingmaker or gang-up-on-the-leader effects. RDI is last-man-standing instead of first-to-10, so these effects are significantly reduced, and it's a short enough game that player elimination doesn't mean too much downtime in a reasonably-sized game.  There is an issue with the power level between some of the decks, but this issue is actually mostly mitigated by the gang-up-on-the-leader issue, until you get down to 1-on-1.

I think maybe the hype spoiled this game for me. Or I ruined it for myself by reading all these session reports and imagining it being like that for my group. Sadly, it felt kind of flat. I like the characters, I like the art style, The premise to me (as a pen and paper rpg guy) was fantastic, but I just didn't feel there was anything exceedingly "awesome" to it. I never have gotten to play part 1, part 3 or the gambling I'm in separate game, so maybe all of those add flavor/enjoyability that I have just missed. *shrug* It is decent though. 

Looking to trade. Very Good to Like new condition. Pics available upon request.

While it stands alone as a game itself, it also upgrades the base game to a more than 4 player game. Sweet spot is around 6 players, gets too long and people lose too many cards per round with more than that.

Initial Impression: This is a good, solid beer & pretzel game along the same lines as Munchkin. With the right group and frame of mind, it's actually enjoyable. There's a fair amount of take-that but it's generally directed at the group rather than any particular individual so there are rarely any hurt feelings.

Got to play at Sacramento ConQuest (March 08).  It looks like a great expansion.  Although I did not get to look at all the new cards, from what I saw it did not look like they added too many unique (and powerful) abilities to the new characters, so that hopefully you will be able to mix the two games without worrying about balance issues.  Same great humor as in the original.  This will be a must have when it is released.  Played again at Kubla (May 08).  Still looks like a great expansion.  Will buy.

I LOVE this game. More of the same great humor from the first game with a lot of nice additions. With eight different characters when combined with the first game, our whole game group can take part in a single game which leads to even more craziness than before. Game still plays fast even with the extra people. Generally just a great time at the gaming table when this hits it.

RATING: 7
I picked this up for both the ability to give players more options on which character they want to play as well as the ability increase the number of players though I don't think I would want to go above six.  I also think the character options will be more popular than those of Red Dragon Inn One.  I also like the fact that this isn't just an expansion, but a full version of the game just with different characters.

I sorta like the roles in this one better and the do seem to play easier (though that could be having more familiarity with the game.  I do like the introduction of some of the new drink deck cards.  I am glad I added this almost immediately after the first game to double the character choices and increase the numbers of players.  I probably won't go over 6 in a group without breaking it up into two separate games.

Played this in combination with Red Dragon Inn with 8 players.  Tended to drag because 7 out of the 8 have never played before.  Of course, the one person who had, me, was the first one to go out, and fairly early I might add.  It speeded up towards the end with fewer people and they got used to the cards.  Veterans can bang this game out pretty quick.

Combined with Red Dragon Inn, plays 8 people.  Not many of these around. Nice to do before we break into 2 groups.  I see playing it once in awhile just to give some variety.

Has some humor and is morally okay cause the point is, not to get drunk.

Unhappy with the unreasonably small sized print on the cards.  (Plenty of room for a larger font.)

Similar in spirit to Munchkin: most of the fun comes from the players and what they bring into the game. We had a very dodgy Eve and a role-playing Gog which made for a fun game, but otherwise I suspect it would have fallen flat. An advantage over Munchkin is that you actually feel like you have a minimum of control.

I'm posting the same review for both The Red Dragon Inn and The Red Dragon Inn 2 as they can both be played as standalone games or together and use the same mechanics. The only difference seems to be the character decks.

The Red Dragon Inn is a lighthearted game with solid mechanics allowing for both casual and serious players. My main concern initially was that certain character decks would be unbalanced and quickly become favorites, however it appears that they've done an excellent job of balancing the abilities while maintaining a unique feel for each character.

I highly encourage roleplaying and each player should read the name of the card their character's voice.

More of the same. Well rounded and fun characters to add to your original game of Red Dragon Inn. Mix with the original characters, but don't try playing with all eight. As soon as someone gets ahead, the rest of the table will focus all of their attacks and dirty tricks on them, and there is no way to defend against it. They will be dead before they take another turn, and it really takes the fun out of the game. You can probably get away with 5 players, but that should be the limit.

Copied text from review for the first game: Light filler game that is ultimately of no consequence. It struck me as Munchkin-lite, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It plays faster than the average Munchkin game, but it doesn't offer the same plethora of choices or even the fluid dynamics of the gameplay. (In this, you're forever stuck as the same character with the same cards.) It's a fun, easy game to pick up and play - but I wouldn't go out of my way for a copy.

"Kind of a fun and light game of "take that". Not deep strategy, so it's an easy game to keep up with and play while people can still talk over the game.  Feels like a filler, but lasts about an hour.  Probably would play again, if everyone else wants to.  "

RATING: 7
The second installment of [gameid=24310]. By itself, it plays just like it's predecessor with more deliberate characters: Ogre does damage, Dwarf defends, Bard gambles, and Illusionist is a little below average in everything.

It's disappointing that the characters don't build off of the 1st deck (no orcs and trolls) meaning Slugfest Games is [b]milking the franchise[/b] - imho HUGE TURNOFF.

The game's redeeming factor is now 8 players can play at once. This makes the game [b]extremely cut-throat[/b] with gambling rounds. Players must be really sly about when to jump into the round and watch out for those annoying winning hands. 

The drawback is that it [b]takes forever to get your turn[/b] and there's a good chance for non-gambling characters to be out before you can say "I don't think so".

My (grown) daughter loves this one.  It is always her first choice.  
This adds characters to the main game.  If you don't care about more people, don't bother buying it.
We now realize that 8 players makes the game go too long.  We are actively looking for a faster variant.

Red Dragon Inn is a lot of fun to play.  I even like it with big groups, the only problem is that when you play with a big group if someone has analysis paralysis you are hosed and the game will take forever.  You really need to keep this game moving and it will be fun, but if people are slow the game will be painful.

The Red Dragon Inn 2 is a thematic game of Take That mainly targeting light gamers that can be combined with more versions for a party game. More of the same as The Red Dragon Inn, it adds more characters.

After experiencing the imbalanced play of the original Red Dragon Inn, I wasn't overly excited to play the newest addition to the franchise.  While the deck may be more balanced, I actually had less fun with these characters than with those in the previous game.  I'm not sure what's different about this game or whether it's just that the charm has worn off, but I wasn't able to enjoy the humor of these characters as much as I did with the previous ones.  Perhaps more play would improve my perceptions, but for now, I'd rather play the original despite its flaws.  I haven't tried combining the two together, which could make for a better overall experience.

A great game on it's own and a lot of care and consideration seems to have been made to make sure it's a great game when combined with the original.

The two RDIs combined probably make an 8 out of 10, as the extra choice in characters means you can finally change character when playing with 4 players- a very good thing. Down time can become a problem with 5+ players, but it doesn't take away too much of the game's fun.

Also this games biggest draw back is a bad one- player elimination. If you are first to go out it can be 30+ minutes before the game ends which isn't fun.

Still makes it as the best novelty card game though.

RATING: 9

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This has quickly become one of my favorite games.  It plays fast with no down time.  Easy to teach and the rules are VERY clearly written.  There's very, very little ambiguity in how the cards effect each other.  
That alone adds two points to my score.

I had originally thought that the game dragged with four players.  That was right after we got it.  Now that we know how the cards work a little better it really goes fast.

Still a little dubious about more than four though.  Doesn't seem like there's enough interaction at that level and it might take a really long time.

Strangely works [i]really[/i] well as a two player game.

My gateway game. Played games once a week @ work but owned none...till I found RDI demoing at PAX East.  Immediately bought all 3 editions plus the 2 expansion characters, and kicked in for the full Kickstarter for RDI 4 + expansion characters.  The learning curve is simple, drawing in even non-gamer gamers, the rules are fleshed out, there's plenty of game balance, the cards are funny and well drawn, and it makes for a fantastic warm-up or party game.  Easily my favourite game so far.

This seems like a fun game concept, and I'd not often be unwilling to play this towards the end of a game night. But there are issues which prevent me from enjoying this as much as I perhaps should - it goes on too long for this type of light silly game, there is a lot of downtime as players interrupt each other's turns, and also I'm not 100% sure that the decks are that well balanced.

This game is about drinking and gambling.  The drinking part is pretty funny and the cards can mess with people pretty good.  The gambling part could use some work but I'm not quite sure what.  With only one play I'm looking forward to playing it again.  Great theme, artwork and sillyness to make it fun. 

I played the expansion with the original for a total of 8 players.  Too Chaotic and it drags too much if you are playing with new people.  5 is the max I'd probably want to play with.

I don't know that it plays very well with eight players.  In my first eight-player Red Dragon Inn game, the first four players kicked out played a quick of Lascaux while we waited for the other players to finish.

I enjoyed this game, but I was a little disappointed when the characters were all very similar to the first one (no special rules or abilities.) *Note that I purchased the pooky expansion deck firs, and loved his "mood" mechanic.

So this game feels like an expansion rather than a brand new game...

Still a good buy if you don't have the first, or just want some new characters - Gog the Half-Ogre has some of the funnies fluff text IMO

RDI2 was my introduction to the Red Dragon Inn world, and it's great. All of the characters are very simple and straightforward--especially compared to later games--but all of them still have a ton of character.

It's a great standalone introduction to the RDI world.

Some overlap with characters from Inn #1.  Dwarf plays somewhat like Gerkie, Half-Ogre is much like Fiona.  Still lots of fun and expanding beyond 4 is great.  I have found 6 seems to be the best number of players to keep things interesting, but not feel like forever has past before your turn.  Eve is the most unique addition this round.

A fun game, basically identical to the first but with new characters having slightly different playstyles.

RATING: 8
A game that focuses on all the fun stuff that adventurers do after they're done in the dungeon.

This second set is standalone or can be mixed with the adventurers in the original set.

This is probably one of my favorite games on this site.  Whether you're playing a simple 3-4 player game or a frantic 10+ player game (I can't wait to try a 14 player game with the new expansions!), it's great fun.

This is one of those games that really has it all-- simple mechanics, incredibly balanced, great player interaction, always interesting, and always fun.  It's actually amazing that the game is now up to 14 characters and no one character feels stronger than the other (well, except for maybe Eve...).

This is one of those games I am always up to play with friends and it just never really gets old because there are so many different characters to play that all feel different.  If I had to pick a favorite expansion, it would probably be Red Dragon Inn 2 for Dimli and Gog, but they're all worth it.

Like it slightly better than [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24310] the original[/url], but really think that the best way to experience them is together in larger games.  The characters are a little more unique in this game.  The half-orc in particular is a nice touch, as is the (spoony?) bard.  Of course, that may be a drawback if all you're looking for is the typical characters.

Only played this 8-player with the first 2 sets.

I think a conversation I had with a friend after this about sums it up:

Me: "In the category of 'Sort of party games that have enough strategy that you have to pay attention but not so much that it actually matters', this is probably about the best one I've played."
Him: "Yeah - I wouldn't ask for it, or tell anyone I know they should buy it, but I'd be willing to play it."
Me: "I would tell one friend to buy it - he'll love the theme, and it will hopefully get me out of playing Munchkin next time."
Him: "Ah. Yes, that would be an excellent reason to buy this."

Do not play this game with 8.  What might have been a slightly bearable game with 4 turns into torture with 8.

Love this game.  Best played as a drinking game.  Would give this a 9 or 10 if it weren't for the fact that when players pass out or run out of gold, they're out of the game.  I like games that keep all players in the game until the end.

We played with both 1 and 2. We had 7 players. There is a lot of give and take but you keep getting more alcohol or more tired no matter what you do. Each player deck is slightly different so you have to play to your character's strength. I had the sneak that liked to gamble so I tried to run everyone out of money. I knocked out 4 in one hand but still only made it to second place.

Expansion of Red Dragon that can be mixed-and-matched with the previous edition and allows for more players. New card varieties of new characters helps to freshen up the basic game. Still light, still random, still fun.

A decent expansion that can accommodate up to 8 people, but with more players means longer downtime and more complext interaction between the cards, events and interrupts.  Almost doesn't seem to worth the trouble to be honest.

RATING: 10
This is on par with RDI 3 in terms of "best versions" of Red Dragon Inn. I slightly lean towards RDI3 as the top one, because I love the secondary decks it has, but this is probably the best one for new players to start with because (IMO) the characters here are much better than the original characters. Dimli and Gog are 2 of the best in the entire series, and Eve is really solid as well (easily top 10). Fleck can even be interesting sometimes too.

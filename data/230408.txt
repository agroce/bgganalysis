It definitely beats playing regular monopoly as gametime is MUCH shorter. Handling of the coins gets finicky, but it can still be a fun game. I love Mario, so it gets a "1UP" just for that, haha.

RATING: 6
This one was ok in a few ways. First, it has a limited number of rounds - when the Boss Fights are over, the game is over. Second, players each have unique powers - it adds some variety to play.  Third, it speeds up movement through pipes - which further speeds up the game. But in the end, it is just a random game - not much you can do beyond hope the dice are polite and place you where you need to go. Nicely, the properties are worth points - but to get those points, you really need to be lucky. I like the playing pieces. So good for kids, I'd play it again if pressed.

Faster and more fun than the other Monopoly games, because the mechanics do not allow the game to drag on forever and ever without really getting anywhere, which can sometimes happen in the other versions of Monopoly.

(Up Front... I'm not a monopoly fan) This game doesn't feel like I'm playing Monopoly. It's quick, it's fun, and it's different every time. Love the characters and their special abilities. I can see this making it to the table every time we have a family game night. 

Only real issue I have is the characters do seem a bit unbalanced for their super special abilities.

The best way I can describe this is it plays like a Mario Kart board game with the added idea of property ownership and going to jail from Monopoly. If you hate dice rolling and randomness, stay away from this. But, if you really enjoy the "gotcha!" type of player interaction, then this is right up your alley.

Monopoly has experimented with a lot of different styles these days, and this one’s one of the better versions. I know the original Monopoly is known for dragging on for hours sometimes, but this one is basically over after the 10th time a piece passes GO. This is usually well under an hour in typical game play speeds. The last boss can have a big influence on who wins this game, so you usually can’t completely count yourself out until the end. Also in typical Monopoly style, the dice roll pretty much entirely decides who wins this one… but if that’s your style of gaming, this one’s for you!

RATING: 10
The new game mechanics introduced into this version of Monopoly - namely the Boss Battles - fixes one of my long-time gripes with the game...that it lasts forever!  This game ends when all bosses have been defeated or are allowed to escape. Boss battles are initiated each time someone passes Go, so that means that after a mere 2 passes each of a 4 player game, the game is over.  The winner is also based on points which is a combination of properties, money, and bosses defeated.

In all, it's a really fun take on Monopoly with the classic Mario characters (including Bowser if you opt for the Collector's edition which I highly recommend) that doesn't take too long to play (about 30 - 45 minutes).

Best version of Monopoly I have ever played. The Mario theme is great. Also, it's not as long and everyone has a special power. In the end, there are not many real decisions. Most of the game revolves around what is rolled on the dice. Still, it can be fun to play with kids.

--------------------------------------
Why do I love it?
--------------------
I am in LOVE with this game right now and I would tell everyone to have this game!
You Start out with coins you roll the dice and move to a property, you can buy that with your coins! If anyone lands on a spot YOU own they pay you coins. If you pass GO you do a New Feature, Boss Battles (Ex: You land on GO, you draw a Koopa Kid like Lemmy. You pay coins to fight the boss and you have to roll a number to win like  "Pay 1 Coin To Fight" and "Roll a 4, 5 or 6 to win") If You win, every boss has a reward (ex: Buy a Property from a player or everyone pays you 2 coins)
Fight Bosses, Collect Coins and Buy Property to win the game!
-----------------------------------------
What do the Expansions DO?
---------------------------
The "DLC Characters" are avaible at any store. In Monopoly Gamer, Every charcter has a unique power (ex: Mario can get 4 Coins on a Power Up dice, NOT 3. Yoshi can collect all dropped coins on the board.)
Now you start with 4 Characters
-Mario
-Yoshi
-Peach
-Donky Kong
You can get more Mario Charcters like:
-Wario
-Luigi
-Diddy Kong
-Boo
If I could say my fav "DLC" Packs are
-Fire Mario | Can make people drop coins. ALOT of Coins
-Boo | Can Drop 3 Coins and Steal ANY Power of any character on the board
-Toad | Can Roll dice twice to move farther on the board
--------------------------

Monopoly sucks. But this isn't really Monopoly. People who are giving it a poor rating and saying "it's just Monopoly" clearly haven't played it. I introduced this to my game group (who are all pretty serious gamers) and we all had tons of fun. It's your 'beer and pretzel' mindless rolling game and is unlikely to see a ton of play time, but it will be great for bringing out for the people who get to game night early and just want something to do. The figures are nice to boot and I just might leave them out as decoration around the game shelf. Plus, I love Mario games so that helps =)

Yes, it is better than Monopoly, but that is a low bar to set. While it got some things right, such as ditching the paper money, creating nice painted Super Mario minis, and creating a timed end-game trigger, the overall game still isn't very fun, and felt way too random. I got it to play with my kids, but two-thirds into their first game, they lost interest in playing.

A cute, fast playing variation on the Monopoly theme. At most, you will play until players pass go a total of 8 times combined (8 boss battles, 1 per passing Go). The game is about 99% luck based with only the decision of which other player to target with your special ability or power up die really affects anything.

The game takes traditional Monopoly and dumbs it down. A lot. The game is entirely determined by dice and there's almost nothing you can do about it. Money comes and goes faster than any variant of Monopoly I've ever played.

The Mario Kart aspect is a little cute. I with they would have used the MK figures instead. Ultimately, it's just a lighter version of Monopoly with purchasable extra characters. All the hype during the summer it released was completely unwarranted. My kids do love it though.

The game feels more like Mario Kart than it feels like Monopoly. Sure there are still properties, jail (for some stupid reason), and a huge amount of luck. But it's a game I don't mind playing. Game play is relatively short and you win by acquiring points. The kids love it, too, which is an added bonus.

Wow, I hate this more than normal Monopoly. It's really unbalanced. In the beginning, players went bust over and over and we kept lending them money to just keep them in the game. Then the money pours in, but more so for some players than others. It elimates all the charm of vanilla Monopoly (what there is) and replaces it with annoying mechanism.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
I looove the nostalgia this game brings. Why couldn't they just name it Mario Kart? Because that is what it is. I think the quality of the cards, character pieces, and the game board is durable. The art is great as well. I am not a fan of the original Monopoly, but, thankfully, this has very few similarities with the original. Takes 20-30 minutes to play. There are other characters with other abilities you can buy separate if you want more variation. Only thing is that I wish the board was a bit larger and could play more than 4 people. I wish it would last just a little bit longer. Overall, a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I had a fun with it, but people that I played with it, hated the random aspect. I play tested it with custom rules and snow tails cards, and loved it allot more, as less randomness and faster game pace.  Basically once a dice is rolled you can also play a card to add to a dice to make it more as in control of a roll, just for the movement. While battle is still random. I would need to play it more with same people to see exactly whether it works well. It makes it harder to play it when having a group that aren't open to exploration and draw a line even before a play. Otherwise game is ok, as a theme it is great and kids will enjoy it when iPad is not around.

The claims that this is Monopoly with strategy is malarky.  The game is thankfully shorter than regular Monopoly, but the decision space is super tiny and obvious to adults.  Found playing with kids to be a chore having to do the accounting each turn when landing on properties.  Way overhyped game.  There are far better games to play with your kids.

Monopoly Gamer is just plain, simple fun. Sure, it's mainly chucking dice and moving, so you won't find much here in terms of forming a strategy or executing a game plan...but who cares? Every game can't (and shouldn't!) be a brain burner. Monopoly Gamer offers so many fun moments and is sure to be a big hit with gamers of all ages. I'm not always a big fan of Hasbro's productions, but I tip my hat to them for what they have done with this title.

My 8 and 4 year old boys love it!  We have played Mario kart before so that helps them relate to the characters/theme better. We may have played original monopoly game as a family once, but never go back. Monopoly deal is very popular for us though.

I will keep playing as long as my kids do...it is fun but not many decisions to be made. Wish there were a couple more choices to be had...maybe we will make some house rules as we play more where you can pay/auction before a round starts to draft another character's power or star ability. Maybe we can integrate some of the monopoly deal cards with the game. Haven't played party mode yet so interested to give that a try.

This is going to be one of the most popular/widespread kids games in 2017, hands down.

2018 update...
Dropping this down to 7. Still a fun one to go to in family, but replay value is hurting it. We added new characters but we still go for the same characters. We do use this game to introduce to families with young kids to new board games.

Monopoly inspired, it has a board... you go around it, there are properties that you can buy, the familiar free parking, jail, and go to jail spaces, and the most expensive properties are right before "Go". Toss in "boss fights" ( die rolls ), asymmetric player powers, and a healthy dose of take that and  you've got something completely different. Pulled off a 4 player game in just about 30 minutes. It was light and silly. Maybe not a gamer's game, but not bad for a filler or for something to play with the kids.

Monopoly Gamer just takes regular Monopoly trims the fat and making it a faster game. There are no houses, no utilities, no railroads, no good reason to trade properties, and everything is based on the luck of the dice. What I like about the game is that it still gives me the feeling of Monopoly. Feelings of frustration, hope, and meh (raise shoulders slightly) . Midway through game play it might be clear who will win. Thank goodness that Monopoly Gamer has basically a in game time counter hidden as boss fights. Boss fights get activated every time someone passes go. Which might be the saving grace of this game besides the lovely feel of rolling the dice on the board.

RATING: 6
Re-themes of Monopoly are a dime-a-dozen at this point for better or worse. But hopefully all the negative sentiment towards this business model won't put people off this version as it actually plays pretty differently. The theme doesn't feel as pasted on as many others and it trims out some of the fringe rules to make for a more streamlined experience. The biggest additions are variable player abilities, power up dice that let you effect the other players and the boss battles that act as a nice timer, stopping it from running longer than an hour.

It's still Monopoly (roll and move), still mostly luck based, questionably balanced and somehow filled with micro-transactions and yet it's... not bad.  The production values are reasonable (particularly on the figures, less so on the cards) and it's mercifully short for a Monopoly game - almost to the point where many of the key things in Monopoly (like paying rent and collecting sets) falls away into near-irrelevance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Much like other 'child friendly' versions of other games, Monopoly gamer adds some special features that could be interesting in a fuller game, but with the reduction of game time and other features missing, the entire thing just becomes a simple roll the die, hope for the best, with no actual strategy, and thus, fairly boring gameplay.

This game is just like all the other recent Monopoly spin-offs lately (Marvel, Star Wars, etc.). Everyone's character has a special power, certain spaces on the board have been changed (For better or worse), games tend to be shorter (Not always), and you're still just rolling dice for everything. Whoop-dee-do.

I know I'm in the minority, but I think that a lot of these more modernized versions of Monopoly are actually worse than the original rules. You're at the mercy of the die rolls there, but at least there's room for negotiation with the properties and such. Wait, what am I saying? You're still at the mercy of the die rolls here, too! Look, I don't mind people liking this game, but I think it's pretty lame to say you like this and not "regular" Monopoly.

DO not see the buzz.  Still roll and stuff happens. What little in decision making there is has bee diluted by reducing the number of properties and the deal-making that goes along with them. Your special powers are... and I question if they are balanced.

Play seems more complicated than the average MONOPOLY JUNIOR game, but less than regular MONOPOLY, so it seems a good balance as a progressive step between the two for gaming families.

This is a really quick version of monopoly. Once you learn the new "Nintendo special" rules the game to play is insanely fast. Great for kids cause its fast and fun. It can be a bit expensive for a board game of monopoly cause of the bonus characters you can buy but its well worth it.

Played today with my brother and his son (5). It was surprisingly fun for a monopoly game. The child had a blast and did not struggle to keep up. As someone who doesn't care much for how long the original monopoly can drag on, I'm very grateful for the boss fight mechanic added to this game. Every time a player passes go, they trigger a boss fight. After all bosses have been defeated, the game ends. This kept the game to ~45 mins, or 3-4 trips around the board. In effect acquiring monopolies, trading, and auctioning all become secondary elements. Regarding balance, this will help children that don't easily grasp those concepts to stay competitive.

Willing to play over normal monopoly, this game my nephews both 8 and 5 really like it, my non gamer mom likes it and then she started playing other games like Splendor with me because of this.

A good method of teaching your children that life isn't fair.   

With so few real decisions, the game is more like watching sports than actually playing a game.  That said, there are lots of fun moments to be had as you cheer your pawn around the track.   Like a "popcorn flick" of board games.

The extreme frequency of "take that" and unfairness present in the game actually creates an interesting effect where all players are laughing at, and cheering on the ridiculous bad luck of other players.  This effect is similar to Galaxy Trucker where players can find entertainment in watching their opponent's ship be completely destroyed.  

With scores like 450-220-30-10, someone at the table is sure to be rolling their eyes... but unlike Monopoly, the game ends before person being dragged through the mud is enraged enough to flip the table.   

If you need to play Monopoly, this is the one to play.

RATING: 6
Everything that is theoretically fun about regular Monopoly is now actually fun.  Everything that is actually terrible about regular Monopoly is now forgivable.  It's reasonably fast, it remains reasonably tense until the end, the characters are reasonably balanced, it's reasonably immune to mindless spite.  It was a good game with the family and an amusing game with gamers.  Quite the design feat.

The imbalanced characters are close enough to be usable for handicaps and age imbalance, but not so strong that they always determine the game.

For adult gamers:  6/10
For families and kids:  8/10
For die hard Monopoly fans:  ???

Very light luck based, roll and move game with Nintendo theme. I admit I hate the original monopoly, but this version of it appealed to the kid in me and would be a decent gateway game for me to pull out with kids or some new gamers. Will keep in my collection for a while. Bonus points since it plays really fast so it doesnt overstay its welcome on the table.

Collected from AJ during 2017 trip to Toronto/Buffalo.

A few words on my rating for this game:

I rate according to ‘desire to play’ part of the BGG rating descriptions and this is the only game in my collection that I “always want to play and expect this will never change“. So it has to get a 10.

Now that’s not to say it’s an amazing, outstanding, awesome game. It’s not. But it is incredibly fun to play. And never fails to cheer me up.

It's still Monopoly for good or ill but it only took and hour and the coins were flying fast and furiously. We ended up house-ruling boss fights so the player could pay until the boss was defeated. It screwed up some balance issues, but forced the end of the game. There was only a 30 pt difference between our two scores, so "not bad" but I'm not in a hurry to play it again.

Truly feels like Mario Kart on a board. Doesn't really feel that much like Monopoly. But the game sort of "plays itself" since it's almost entirely based on dice rolls. But the theme REALLY shines and makes you feel like you're playing a console Mario party game.

Really quick too! Doesn't overstay its welcome.

RATING: 6.5
[Hasbro Chinese 17 Edition] {Monopoly; dice-rolling; optimal 4p} Monopoly Gamer Edition is a refreshing variant of Monopoly.  The game becomes fast-paced and fun, but it will make the game more luck driven than the basic version.  I don't see why players may trade between themselves, either.

In this edition, players have to get the highest score to win.  Score comes from property, bosses, and money.  We don't need to build any house or hotel.

The rules don't explain something well such as the power of certain character or boss: force trade, etc.

The component quality is average.  The plastic figures are so so.  The coins look chip. The cards are thin.

As a fan of Mario Party and Monopoly-esque games, this game hits the spot for me. Great take-that elements in the power-ups that lead to some interesting deals when done right (are you SURE you want to make me pay rent when I have a red shell?), and I'm always a sucker for characters with different abilities. The game is fairly simplistic, so I can understand the lack of appeal for some, but when treated as a light party game I think it's solid.

This is basically Uno: The Board Game.  Lots of take that, hardly any meaningful decisions at all.  Luckiest player wins.

The decision space is only a hair more than base Monopoly. And even then, what little decisions you have are super obvious.  There is no strategy.  I'm baffled as to why it's getting love from serious gamers. It's only saving graces are that it plays quicker and has a neat theme. There are hundred and hundreds of games that are as light as this and just better.

RATING: 7.5
Nice game with very huge twists and turns compared with the original and with the luck factor amplified. Recommended for casual gamers. It is much better and worth to get the Collector's Edition. As many people noted, the collector's edition's coins and the instructions are of much better quality compared to the normal one, and Bowser is a plus too!

Needless to say, the pros and cons:

Pros:
- Everyone can win with luck (meaning you can never dominate in every single game you play) 
- Really cute tokens (DLC too!)
- Collector's Edition is a really good thing to own.
- Very different compared to typical Monopoly (Coins, Character Abilities, Bosses and Points System as opposed to player elimination & richest wins)
- Very fun in general; you can even have custom rules done without altering too much of the game's length (unlike the original one), and still have fun with it.

Neutral:
- Booster Packs (Cost $$ but come with cute tokens)

Cons:
- Very luck driven, not good with hardcore gamers.
- No Bowser boss card in Collector's Edition.
- Some characters are really just too strong!
- Some rules for some characters are not clearly explained under special circumstances in the game.

Overall, will recommend to casual gamers, but not die-hard gamers. :)

Monopoly sucks, rated 2 on the best of days.  Monopoly Gamer takes everything that sucks about Monopoly (e.g. player elimination, takes years, stupid theme, paper money, etc.) and turns it into a fun, highly thematic, 45min roll-n-move romp through Mario World.  Color me pleasantly surprised.  Won't mind playing this again!

A Santa present for the family for Christmas. This takes the basic model of Monopoly Junior and ratchets up the "Take That" aspect while giving more legitimate choices every round and a number of different super powers for each playing piece.  It also limits the game's time frame by not making it go to bankruptcy but only until people have collectively passed Go enough times.  Its still monopoly... so its a silly luck fest... but as a Take That super filler with two appealing themes mashed into one it does a great job for what it is.

Twist on the monopoly formula. This is NOT the monopoly that you're used to. There is no player elimination, no hotels or houses. There are still properties and trading but they are NOT the most important aspect of the game. The goal of game is to have the most points/coins at the end of the game after defeating 8 bosses that trigger each time a player passes go, witch speeds the game up a TON. You can sabotage other players with power ups to make them lose coins. The game however is still VERY luck based but is still a fun fast game.

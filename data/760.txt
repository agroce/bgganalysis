It has taken me a good few years to get my copy of Battle Line to the table.  In fact it seems that in that time I've managed to either lose the 'flags' that come with the game, or they weren't in the box to begin with.
Anyway now I've played it, I love it.

Not sure what to do about the flags though.

My parents sent me this one to fill the gaming void in my life while I was living in Turkey. It's been great! The game is simple to teach, very fun to play, and I think will see a lot of replays. And it was very easy to teach to my Turkish friends, even ones with limited English!

UPDATE: After getting Lost Cities, I just really haven't felt the need to play this one. LC has all the tension and fun with faster turns and higher replay. I'm lowering my rating for Battle Line accordingly.

UPDATE: traded with Bohnanza & Clocktowers for Capitol.

Battle Line is relatively simple if you are familiar with hands of Poker. Although luck plays a role when drawing cards, at least it feels like that you are in control, mostly. The tactical element is the most prominent feature when you are choosing which card to play to win a battle. You are also forced to play your hand which is kind of crisis management or maximisation of potential depending on which way you look at it. Longer term strategy is needed only when deciding which battles you are trying to win.

I enjoy Battle Line although I cannot find anything very special about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Knizia. What can I say? The man's a genius. This reminded me of lost cities in that you have to play cards, even then you have none that you actually want to play. It starts out and you think "ah, that's easy, I'll just spread them out". And then the trouble starts. Wonderful interesting game. I'll play again any time.

RATING: 9
A superbly designed game.  It has to be in the top two or three 2 player, small-box games.  If you enjoy wargames and poker then you're bound to love this.  It has an edge of the seat quality and comes to the boil at the end.  I often play it both ways (as Schotten-Totten and with the battle cards).  Lots to think about and tough decisions to be made, but it's always enjoyable.  One little card play either way can swing it, but it nevertheless rewards a grand strategy.

RATING: 9.2
Just can't get this one to the table as much as I'd like;  my 12-yo is now at least willing to play it, and I'm trying to pull him into it with as much trash-talk as I can manage.  We have a lot of fun with it, with very tense, close battles.

What's funny about this is that although Knizia's infamous for pasting theme on to his games, the theme almost seems to work here.  Not so much in the cards and so forth -- their art is nice enough, but in the overall development.  I find myself silently fitting a combat narrative to the action.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
A quick playing two-player rummy style game, but with very interesting decisions.  Effectively trying to establish strong positions on a flag (and preserving the ability--probability wise--to maximize the power of a position given the limited card hand size), while not tipping your hand to your opponent so they can never be comfortable that you are in a beatable position.

At the same time, realizing that you will likely have to sacrifice one or two flags rather than reduce the power of your other positions, and making sure those flags do not allow an opponent to achieve a break-through.  

There's also a bit of gamesmanship in when and how tactics cards are employed, given the rule limiting the ability of player to play a number of tactics cards that is no greater than one more than the number of tactics cards played by the opponent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
If you're looking for a two-player strategy game you can just whip out and play anytime, buy this. Now. There is so much hidden in this easy-to-learn card game. It's deep, addictive, and your friends will want to buy it too. Everyone I've played this with has been enamored by it. I would have given this a 10 rating, though I do have one wish, and that's that the artwork was better. It's not bad artwork, it's just not as stellar as the game itself is. So, wishing the artwork was better, I decided to knock this down to a 9.

Great game. The more I play this one the more fun it becomes. It's short enough that you can play a couple games in a row which is very nice with a game like this. Minimal downtime, minimal AP yet still very deep. A great, great game.

Best feature? My wife will play it with me!

Base game:

Great little 2 person card game filled with feints, and deceptions, that can accommodate aggressive and passive play (even in the same round). Difficult choices can occur. 

Can slightly bog down towards the end when no cards left to draw and players mentally calculate what cards the opponent has before playing.

Some players may not like the randomness of the card draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have played a lot of games of hand management, but this rules supreme.  It is one of my favorite Euros
.

You are playing 9 simultaneous hands of poker-lite face up with 6 "suits" (colors).  If you win 3 hands in a row or 5 of 9, you win.  Each turn, you draw a card and MUST play one. Therein lies the difficultly: you don't want to get rid of cards.  You want to hold them and see what you can play out, but instead, you are flying by the seat of your pants and constantly improvising.

It's money-less poker that manages to keep you engaged.  This simple little game requires as much skill in hand management as any that I have seen.  The theme is really weak, though: it's just NOT the game that you are going to scream, "SPARTA!!!!!" in, ya know?

But despite that shortcoming, this is by far the best Euro/Knizia game that I have ever played.

I got the beautiful reprint from Roland's Revenge English second edition 2017 and it is just that much more fun with the nice look. The gorgeous artwork hides the abstractness (mathy and statistic nature) of this area control card game from Reiner Knizia, which makes me like it. I probably would not have bought the other versions. Like the lighter Lost Cities, the stalling and mind-games are the best part of the game.

This game looks awful. The graphic design comes across as cheap rather than sparse. It evokes Solitaire, which correlates to boredom and waste in my mind.

The game itself is straightforward. For mine, like a lot of Knizias, too straightforward. Like Lost Cities, which is only marginally worse, there isn't that much going on. You manage your hand to form the best combinations within the broader diminishing probabilities of the overall set. This is the backbone of many competitive card games, but this game breaks down because there just aren't that many useful combinations. I think you really have to play for trips and straight flushes; the odds just aren't there on the other combinations. 

Without tactics, this is a very dry game of probabilities. With tactics, it's a weak game of probabilities that can be jolted into irrelevance by swingy effects. I will concede there is some tension around key positions occasionally, but I think if you are focused on accurately assessing your position you will find there is precious little control over the outcomes beyond your immediate hand. 

I'D RATHER WE PLAYED:[thing=43022][/thing]. Two-player card games, in particular, need not only a valuation component, but a hand-reading component. Battle Line is no more than Solitaire in any meaningful way because you can't make reasonable predictions of your opponent's hand, and thus future plans. Without this, the hidden information of card games is just variance.

Lots and lots of logic and tension.  That's cool.  A little lacking in fun, though.  It's quick, ok, better than most traditional 2-player card games, certainly, and a big improvement on Lost Cities.  Mrs. alexd isn't that keen on it, but doesn't hate it (and tends to win a lot).

We play by roughly the Schotten Totten rules (no 10s, no tactics cards) which is the essence of the game.  
I prefer this "theme" to the silly Scottish stuff -- it does feel like your line is falling when they're close to a 3-in-a-row.

Even though it is the source of a lot of suffering (and very few victories) I must admit this is an excellent game, really tense, I think it is one of the few AP-inducing games for me.

I'm absolutely not a big fan of card games. This one is one of my favorites though. It is easy to play and very entertaining. It is called "Battle Line" and is designed around war features, but in fact has nothing to do with a war game. It is a card game with a  very light flavor of war game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Battle Line is poker-like (and I hate and despise poker), but the tactical cards add a delicious element to the game that poker just doesn't have. Really, the pasted-on theme is irrelevant to the game.....and yet, for some strange reason, I can't imagine myself enjoying it as much with just about any other theme. Many people have compared it with Balloon Cup and Lost Cities; for myself, it reminds me of a much shorter and much simplified version of Twilight Struggle, without Defcon! Of course, Battle Line (and its Scottish predecessor) far predate Twilight Struggle: did Messrs Gupta and Matthews have visions of hoplites dancing through their heads when designing TS???????
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a pretty good game. Simple rules but lots of tough decisions with each card. While thematically it doesn't really have much to do with its theme of "battle formations," it's still a good card game, very thinky but quick to play. Can be frustrating towards the end with no options that don't advantage your opponent, depending on your card draws.

A great 2 player card game. There are a few different strategies and it plays a little like lost cities (playing on opposite sides of the same goal, trying to outdo your opponent while only playing on your own side) but also has some tactics cards which increase the variety of the game.  I feel like this game could be better with an expansion of more tactics cards or possible a new mechanical element.

Can play with or without tactics (and, really, you can almost have a game without tactics cards simply by abstaining). It's extremely tense, and there are often agonizing decisions about when to "commit" to a hand (as in, if you commit to a flush you're ceding to everything better than that) and when to abandon a pawn. You have to think through when a pawn can be claimed (though this doesn't often take too long), and it all plays quickly. It's quick, fun, tense, and thinky. Though abstract, it feels like it plays differently. There is a substantial luck element, but it doesn't kill the fun.

Played it once, won 5:1, liked it, I'll probably play it again (even if I do not have it). A bit too "cold" for my tastes, given the subject, but this is quite usual with German games. Besides, that's a problem of personal taste. I think that's well designed and plays smoothly, and it has several interesting little features from a designer point of view.

I simply love this game.  Simple use of poker hands, i.e. royal flush, straight, 3 of a kind, etc., played cleverly against an opponent.  A real risk-taking game where you are always pushing your luck and comparing the odds on getting that one card.  Yet, one card alone does not win you the game, you also have to be aware of your opponent's moves and be prepared to counter them, or cut your losses.  THE perfect two-player game.

This game is a keeper. Simple rules, so accessible to a wide audience. Lots of fun tension packed into a small box and short play time. Knizia has a knack for putting some kind of hook into all these numbers games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Knizia is a master at creating a great deal of immersion, tension, and "thematic feeling" from what really looks like just a numbers game. Battle Line is yet another in this vein and it can really deliver some exciting and tense battles. 

Great game to play with muggles and highly portable. The card quality is a bit crappy and the box is odd but I don't mind. Will always keep this one for the niche it occupies. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but nothing special either. 
Knizia's hallmarks appear as usual: Mathematical depth with abstract mechanics and a pasted theme. Indeed the game could be named otherwise and have different themes and none would notice. Good as a filler. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Playing base game.  A simple, quick two player card game that plays breezily with decisions that feel interesting.  It is not particularly complex, just straightforward and interesting enough to please.  

Yet, now after further plays, I can see some tantalizing complexity creeping into this one.  I suppose you really could analyze the board state and your hand with interesting results, gears turning.  I really like the different feeling of the first 3 minutes, the middle three minutes, and the final 3 minutes.  The board develops nicely, and choices become limited, and the decisions harder.

The perfect two player game. Spent ages trying to track down a copy (did not want the silly Scottish version) defnitely worth it.

We play that when you play the Scout card you can only draw 2 tactics cards and one from the deck. Also, we play that one player cannot play both Alexander and Darius. If a player draws both then they can swap Darius for a non-tactic card (the Darius card being discarded from the game).
These two variants avoid one player having too great of an advantage due to lucky drawing of tactics cards.

RK, the living legend of board game design, makes another hit.  Although simple, it is definitely innovative and spunky.  The use of poker hands to prove that you have one flag or another, over a nice solider formation theme, is a nice light touch.  Its far from any kind of simulation, but it is very addicting and games are very quick.  The flaw is when it tries think it is more advanced then it really is, with the option to draw from a tactics deck, which sort of just gives you cards that allow you to win a pile, rather than really altering gameplay, and it is too random to develop any strategies for.  All in all, still a clever little card game.

Surprisingly thematic game: the card play is evocative of committing units to various parts of a battle.  Bluffing and luck play a significant role, but so do tactics.

I much prefer this without the tactics cards, as they make what is a tight game into something more loose, as many of the tactics cards are quite situational: it becomes a game of hoping to draw the "good" cards.

RATING: 5
My dislike for this game probably goes lower than the '5' rating, but my wife did like it, and I want to be fair because there is something here.  I'd play it again, but it would be hard to take it at all seriously.

Ultimately, the problem is that the game is too heavily influenced by luck.  It's deceptive at first because there are a lot of decisions.  You have to manage your hand, choose your formations, choose the best spots to play them, track your opponent, count cards, and play the odds.  

The tactics cards add a much needed deeper level of possibilities.  (Though since you can only play one more tactic card than your opponent has, these cards can be frozen out of play rather easily.)

But in the end, between two competent players, the game is just too easy to play (nearly) optimally.  And then it just comes down to who draws more of the cards they need -- and who doesn't.  After all the hand management, you and your opponent will settle down on a handful of formations that require one or a few cards to complete and you'll take turns drawing to see who gets it.  

It's very unsatisfying.  For something this light, I'd much rather play Lost Cities.

+ Great card game! Short, simple, gives you some hard decisions to take. 
- As any card game, it also depends on luck. Controlling the amount of tactics cards used in the game is fundamental. Or don't use them at all (which is what I usually do)

RATING: 5
This game is fine.  It's a Knizia game, so the theme is paper thin, the scoring is a bit convoluted, and the mechanics are very reminiscent of Lost Cities (play a card, draw a card).  If you think of this game like poker meets rummy meets Lost Cities, you've got the idea.  The tactics cards make things more interesting.

RATING: 7
A reworking of Schotten Totten but with a more cut throat feeling.  For a card game this does a very good job of simulating an ancient battle of 2 forces.  There are weak points and strengths along the line, but like a real battle, these can sometimes prove to be illusions.  The game plays fast with a element of deduction as the cards are played out and options are created or removed based on card plays.  A good player will keep an eye on the cards and know when to claim a victory before an opponent can disrupt the battle with a command card.  Best played as the best of 3 games since the games are so short.  One of Knizia's solid designs.  [GTI: AGCL]

I don't play enough of this, truth be told. Tile laying games will always be very satisfying and tactile. I've only played vanilla rules with at least three players, so there are actually quite a few experiences which I've yet to have with this game, such as the cutthroat nature of 2-player or the greater strategy of having a hand of pieces.

Still, this is a go-to game for playing with kids or people who don't want much of a rules lecture at all.

Battle Line is a stereotypical "couple's game" that I continue to play on a regular basis. Part of the reason is the simplicity, quickness, and familiarity... but the game itself hasn't annoyed me like other gateway games have. So many lighter games seem to fall prey to easy-decisions and winners/losers being determined by dumb luck. While battle line isn't a deep game, there are always meaningful decisions in each game. 

Today, I have grown a bit tired of it because I've played this game so much (much more than my recorded plays). Yet, it keeps getting played and I keep enjoying each game. This game is a keeper.

RATING: 8
Two-player Knizia card game, with the player playing three card poker hands over seven 'flags', trying to win either five in total or three in a row.

I like this, and I like better than Knizia's other two player card game Lost Cities (which I still like) as Battle Line got a bit more strategy to it than Lost Cities. The components are okay (better than I expected from seeing reviews, but not as good as Lost Cities), but its complete colourblindness-unfriendliness is a deal breaker for me (my current two-player opponent is colourblind). Sigh.

Very good 2 player card game. The quality of the cards is good, the art on them could be much better though, and the plastic flags look like anything but flags. Apart from this, this is a very enjoyable game. The game gets a little bit slower towards the end because you need to do some card counting in order to deduce your best play, and if you can claim any flag. Great replayability. The 'Scout' tactical card is not very well balanced compared to the other tactical cards, it is weaker and if it is drawn early in game, it's not very helpful, and will downgrade your hand.

This really is a perfect little 2-player game.  It has quite simple rules, especially if you print out a player aid to remind you of the precedence of formations.  What I really like about it is how quickly the decision of what card to play becomes challenging.  With a bad opening draw, it can happen right away, and it only gets harder as you have to count the cards that are out there and do some reasoning.  I should say that I think the game is deeper and more fun when you play with the "Advanced rule" that you can only claim flags at the start of your turn.  Rarely can you do anything productive in these situations, but having that possibility is key, plus being able to slough even one card in these situations helps to make you feel you are still in the game.

Az első benyomások alapján ez az egyik legjobb kártyajáték, amivel eddig játszottam. Az egyik partiban végig mindketten azt hittük, hogy vesztünk, akár egy lépés is döntően befolyásolhatja a kimenetelt, végig nagyon kell figyelni. A speciális kártyák nagyon feldobják a játékot, ha gyors partira van csak idő, akkor azok nélkül is játszható. Sajnos volt néhány szabály, ami nem volt egyértelmű.
Amit kiemelnék még, hogy nagyon szép a kártya, sajnos kicsit sérülékeny.
---
Jó az a szabály, hogy nem lehet korlátlan számú taktikai kártyát kijátszani, de ha az ellenfél nem játszik ki egyet sem, akkor a játéknak ez a szegmense gyakorlatilag nem is jut szerephez.

RATING: 8
It seems to have some depth but I failed to grasp any substantial depth from the first play. Perhaps it's because I played in a crowded area. Waiting for second play to judge better.
Simple numbers game, which leaves room for extra strategy.

2 player set-collection card game that starts off pretty slow, and then escalates as locations to slough off are eliminated. Can get intense as you are trying to draw 'that one card'.  We play with being able to play 2 tactics cards more than the opponent.

RATING: 9
One of the best two-player only games you can play in under 30 minutes. Looks like something the cat dragged in with super simple rules photocopied on top, but the depth and tension of Battle Line cannot be overstated. Among Knizia's most elegant designs.

Initial Impression: This is a fun, quick 2player game that uses mechanisms common in other games that I've played. Unfortunately, the game's theme doesn't shine through for me. I wouldn't play this game without the special cards as I feel they add extra tactics to the mix.

RATING: 8
Great for a quick two player game.  You compete for different "flags" in the battle line by trying to make the best poker hand with three cards.  Whoever has the better hand takes that flag.  There is also a special deck with cards that allow unique actions (like moving an opponent's card to your side of the battle line).  This really keeps things interesting, because victory can be snatched from you in unexpected ways.

I like this game out of the box. This is very rare for me, since I play mostly  heavy games, that I need 3-6 games to understand the engine. However this little card game is as good as it gets - fast, with difficult decisions, some random luck of the draw, and nice tension. A classic game.

RATING: 7.5
This is a very good 2 player game.  The two different endgame scenarios allow a couple of different strategies to be implemented in order to achieve victory.  There is a significant amount of bluffing involved with which cards are played and where.  The Tactics Cards add another level to the game.  This very well could become my favourite 2 player card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an amazing two player card game with a theme that I feel matches the mechanics well. You are basically making poker hand to win flags in a battle, but there is a deep level of play to this game that will surprise you. Play without the tactic cards however, as they make the game chaotic and also use the point system to play at least two games per match. this minimizes the effect of luck. A skilled player will beat a lesser skilled player consistently, as I have proven with numerous opponents!There is a lot of calculations that go on during a match, much more than Lost Cities for example. For competitive play a chess clock is a good idea, as one can spend a lot of time trying to figure out the most promising card play. Early versions from GMT had thin cardstock, newer versions have sturdier stock and is much better.You can play a slightly simpler version called Schotten-Totten here: www.flexgames.com

I've lowered the rating from a 10 because I now believe that whomever gets dealt the most 10-9-8 straight flushes tends to win among skilled opponents.

I'm even teaching my father-in-law the importance of the 'order filler' game.  Had Battle Line on my Christmas list along with a variety of other games.  Gave my in-laws the Thoughthammer website and told them of the free shipping deal.  They were planning on only getting me two games, but fell a little short, so they added Battle Line to the order to get the free shipping.  I'm so glad they did.  What a neat little game.  The tension is immense for what on the surface may seem to be just 3-card poker.  It is so much more, however.  Everyone I've played with wants to immediately play another game after the first one. The tactics cards can either be a blessing or a curse, and card play necessitates tipping your hand as little as possible.  Strategy, bluffing, and anxiety all rolled into one.  It's no wonder this game is rated so high. [Gift]  Update:  The more I play, the more I like.  Give it a 10!

Battle Line, played without the Tactics cards, has the feel of a classic card game. You're basically playing your hand of cards to various 3-card poker hands. 

It is very easy to learn but it took me a couple of plays before I got a sense of how to play competently. 

The thing that makes this game a winner for me is the player hidden information, as you wonder with every move whether you're gaining the upper hand or stepping into a trap.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2012/02/battle-line.html]Battle Line[/url] es un juego abstracto donde el tema que nos proponen es intrascendente. En este juego las matematicas estan al servicio lúdico. El objetivo que formar combinaciones de cartas, estimaciones de probabilidades (que te salgan aquellas cartas que se necesitan en base la las cartas que quedan en el mazo), cuantas formaciones se pueden formas que superen a la mía en un peón dado, lo hacen muy matemático. Es más, aquel que sea capaz de evaluar mejor estadisticamente todos estos aspectos, será el ganador.

Battle Line tiene cierto aroma a Exploradores. Los jugadores deben comprometerse en la construcción de una formación (o de una expedición) antes de tener certeza de si se podrán completarla. En ambos casos se debe jugar una carta en tu turno, incluso cuando no quieres hacerlo... aunque en Exploradores tienes opción de descartar y esto disminuye la tensión de juego, pese a dar al contrario la opción de robarla. Personalmente prefiero Battle Line a mucha distancia.

Man what an absolutely amazing game.  For some reason after a few more months with only 1 more play, I've found that I just don't want to take this out much.  I love it, but rarely want to play it.  Weird.  Re-rated to 9 on 1/22/2010.

From game to game my opinion of this game bounces between randomfest and awesomesauce. Not that I have anything against randomfests, but I like when the game is up front about it. I probably didn't play it enough or with the right people. 

Tactics cards are cool, but they seem to be far from essential.
The best thing about this game is the tension it creates. Every turn you HAVE to play a card. This will almost always limit your future options, give info to your opponent about what you can and cannot do and more often than not take you closer to defeat. Best part: your opponent plays next with these same problems.

Outstanding game.  Once you learn the few straight-forward rules, the game is a breeze to play. And yet, it is filled with agonizing decisions almost every play.  It's only detraction is the theme.  We completely ingore it.  Using the formations names instead of just straigt, flush, etc. might actually make the game more confusing.

We don't play with the tactics cards- they're random power takes away any certainty in row control which is key to the game, IMO.

We do play the advanced rule of claiming flags only at the beginning of the turn.  This gives a little more allowance to "throwing off" crap cards in a row you've just lost, and allows for closer, tighter games.

Definitely one of the better two-player games you can get.  This and Lost Cities are similar games, but although we tired of the latter pretty quickly, this one's got legs!  Many many plays later and we still greatly enjoy it and are always ready to play.

Don't bother with the tactics cards, at least at first.  We didn't and it's our favourite 2-player game by far.  Play by Schotten Totten rules -- no Tactics, no 10s, and I think a 6-card hand limit.

Giving this a 9 so I can give Schotten-Totten a 10, which I prefer.

One of my favorite 2 player card game.  I've never really seen someone run away with an easy victory.  Always seems to come down to the last card.  Not exactly thematic since it's just a bunch of 3-handed poker games, but that doesn't bother me.

RATING: 7.5
Picked up my own custom deck of this game, which needs to hit the table soon. I've played another copy though, and it was pretty good. A simple concept of facing off 3 cards vs 3 cards as normal card hands which get used as battle formations across a line of 9 flags. Decent strategy on this, makes you think a lot and is another one of those games that does not overstay its welcome.

RATING: 7
Pound for pound, this is one of the better two player games. Learning the game takes less than five minutes and game play takes no more than 30 minutes maximum. It is based on a poker set collection mechanic, but, as with Mystery Rummy, the most interesting decisions do not rest on that mechanic (I feel an important point against reductive criticism). The wife loves it because it's close enough to "playing cards" that she can use some of those skills and I love it because I sneak a game which adds surprising depth for such a small package. You really need to contemplate where you want to make a breakthrough and how much you want to tip your hand. I reserve my "10" reviews for "event games" which almost have to be long playing and meaty. The only reason this doesn't rank an "8" or "9" is that the theme bleeds off pretty quickly; we never bothered learning the names of the hands and stuck to the poker terminology, for example. The game doesn't, then, offer any kind of story as does Mystery Rummy or Call of Cthulhu LCG, for example. To its credit, though, it's a tighter, leaner game than either of those with much easier rules. Recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The tactics cards help keep things interesting, but the game is essentially a trick-taking card game where 2 players fight over 9 tricks simultaneously. I like the ease of play, and the short play-time and quick setup make it a quality addition to my lightweight 2-player collection. 

I have not tried the advanced rules, though giving the opponent a chance to respond to your formation before claiming the flag seems like it should be the standard rule in my group. I taught it to a first timer and his immediate question to a claim was "I don't get a chance to respond?" I don't know how shifting the claiming phase to the beginning of the turn makes the game more "advanced". It seems pretty intuitive.

RATING: 8
3 plays:

At first, I felt bogged down with too many possibilities and too much information. Because you have so much information, it can be fruitful, though unpleasant, to take an immense time comparing all of the possibilities. And though the rules themselves are pretty simple, it is complicated to apply the question of whether or not a given battle is winnable; that may well change after a card is played somewhere else, so really you have to be reevaluating many battles after each card is played. Thus the tension and intriguing possibilities don't mount, but merely peter off.

That said, the tactics and player interaction here are wonderfully rich. As long as players are both decently matched (and up for a game that requires lots of strategic thinking), the resulting game is tight and full of subtle tradeoffs. 

So it's not quite the deliciously elegant balance that is Lost Cities, but it's excellent, and I find myself daydreaming about it! 

One more note: the card designs are flat and uninteresting. A colorful re-theme--I'm imagining borrowing the Smallworld brand of fantasy imagery--would add a huge amount.

Great 2 player game - quick but surprisingly deep, especially good with the advanced rules and playing a set of 3 games (most flags over the series wins).

Play lost cities first, then introduce this as a step up. Only downside is the 'war' theme might not appeal to some (playing without the tactic cards reduces the war theme a bit).

RATING: 7.4
Easy game to play.  It is similar in some aspects to Rummy and poker.  This is a great warm up game, cool off game or a game to play with someone unfamiliar with gaming.  

Cards are laid in alternating turns in front of line men or game pieces.  Cards laid develop value based on 3 of a kind, straights and flushes.  Line men are won based on the higher values.  The game on top of this value incorporates tactic cards which can disrupt easily your opponets values.

Another card game that excels with the tactical decisions facing the players facing off against each other. Nice little theme, as players try to outmaneuver one another with the best card combinations and sets. Tactical cards keep it from being dry, and are not quite overwhelming, but can be effective when played at the right time. My second favorite two player game next to LotR: Confrontation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Phenomenal two player, head to head game that pretty much anyone can learn and have fun with on their first play because of the simplicity of the poker hands. Everyone I've taught this to has loved it.

This personally hits on a lot of the right cylinders for me. There's tension in deciding which cards to put down where. There's tough decisions when you have cards that could play in multiple ways but you have to decide how much of a risk you're willing to take. There's a little bit of bluffing when you only put one card down in front of a flag. And I LOVE the deduction element of proving that someone can't beat your formation and claiming a flag before they can put down 3 cards

UPDATE: I have now played without the Tactics cards and think I prefer Battle Line that way. I'm sure I'll play with them again, but my go-to way is going to be without Tactics cards from now on

When first reading about Battle Line I was interested but put off purchasing it due to what I perceived as being "too simple"; I thought the game might start to feel "old" fast, in other words. However, after deciding to make the purchase and playing my first games, I was very surprised by the amount of depth and strategy involved. I would highly recommend it to anybody who is interested in it, but isn't quite "convinced" enough to buy it yet. It is true that the rules are quite simple, but there are so many different "paths" one can take that I'd say Battle Line is worthy of any and all boardgamers with any sort of interest in strategy games. But due to my experiences with this game, I'd add on top of that that I do truly think that !anybody! can find this game interesting and rewarding. For example, over this past Thanksgiving holiday, I got in nine plays with family members: my mother, grandfather, and uncle. Not only did they each want to immediately play a second game, but all three asked me if I had the game with me the following day to play again! I see this as a very good indicator that Battle Line is a universally enjoyable game.

I generally sleeve my card games, but I haven't felt the need to do this with Battle Line as the cards are very thick and feel of great quality.

Unfortunately, at the time of my writing this, it is out of print and being priced at insanely high numbers (today it is going for $100 on Amazon!); however, I do know that GMT intends to reprint the game within the next few months (and I imagine will continue to do reprint runs far into the future), so it should be easily obtainable for the MSRP of $20 with patience.

I find the game play smooth. The "Tactics" cards seemed a little odd at first, but after playing a few games I can now see how and why the game designer has balanced them the way that they have been.

I rate Battle Line as an 8 because I don't think I will ever turn down an offer to play, but I also feel that if I played it too often on a regular basis I might get "burned out" and may no longer be the one "offering" plays. Don't let that dissuade you from a purchase, though, as I think Battle Line !will! be enjoyed by all and deserves a place in the collection of every boardgamer. I cannot fathom of a reason why I would ever want to get rid of my copy.

I've been on a GMT kick lately. War gaming is an area of the hobby that I've ignored from the start, but that's starting to change.

An odd blend of analytical and random gameplay. For some reason it feels like a war game to me, and I basically hate war games. I also hate games that make me feel stupid and though I think the deductive method of "proving" a win for a flag is interesting and unique, I feel stupid when I play this with my husband (who is a theoretical physicist). 

UPDATE: After several plays of this, I like it. It's very tactical, and yes, very random (it's kind of like playing nine games of "Go Fish" at once), but it's satisfying. I still don't like having to keep track of all the numbers/suits at all times, but there's a nice iOS app that does that for me...

Second "Euro" game I played, after Lost Cities. Beautiful artwork. I didn't enjoy my first game, since we forgot the rule that a player can only play one more tactics card than his opponent. (At one point my fiancee had two wild cards plus was stealing and/or trashing my cards!) But after getting the rule right, we found the game very fun. Unfortunately it's a little bit tense and AP-prone for casual gaming after work. UPDATE: This game is just fundamentally sound and interesting. Lots of tough choices where you commit yourself to a plan (much like Lost Cities), but a neat deduction element where you can count the cards on the table too. I absolutely love it.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ A great hand-management filler, where the concept may seem simple (play a card, then draw a card), but it still offer a lot of agonizing choices as around mid game, you don't want to fully display your strategy but you still have to play a card to continue drawing cards to feed your strategy. So you need to choose your battles carefully (the card lanes where you play your cards) in order to win the war (game). This is thus a game with good strategic depth.
++ Relatively small table footprint and really portable game that can be played really almost anywhere.
++ Battle Line feel more thematic than Schotten Totten, because it make more sense to play cards (troops) in a certain ways (formations) to win the battle fields (instead of claiming a stone).
++ This limited edition is really beautiful and well put together and include the Terrain fan expansion, which really add a layer of strategy right from the start when you know the unique battle fields layout.
++ Super easy to teach, super fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- It's a 2-players only game, and for whatever reason, I don't like buying 2-players only games, even though I play a lot of my game just with my wife.
-- I would have prefer to get a printed box of good quality than just a plain black box with a sticker on it.
-- The number color should have been a bit more saturated and contrasted to easily see the different color in lower light environment. Also, the match between some color and flag shape is not optimal in my opinion, as some color that are alike have flag shape that are also alike. At least one of these two things should always be very different to distinguish card's suits easily at a glance.

++ This edition have flag colors that are a bit more over-saturated to easily distinguishing between the 6 colors and the flag shapes are better distributed between the colors (really different flag shape used for similar color).
++ BONUS: We can easily play Arboretum (2-player only) with a Battle Line deck, by only removing the 9-10 card of each suit.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- For basic comments on Battle Line in general, See my negative points from my "English 7th Edition - Roland's Revenge Games 1st Limited Edition" entry.
-- The box is really small and even though the cards are now standard sizes (57mm x 89mm), once sleeved with premium Fantasy Flight Standard American Board Game Sleeves, you have to cut 2-3mm of every cards sleeves top to fit them in the box... and the fit is really tight. I would have prefer a bigger box to easily accommodate sleeved cards.

RATING: 8
Another US remake of a very dry German original that I think is superior. Yeah, I know a lot of the purists don't like the tactics cards, but I think they add an element of fun and drama that the hoplelessly dry Schotten-Totten really needed. The tactics cards *are* somewhat uneven, but it's to a degree that I can live with given the game would be much too mechanical without them - the core game just isn't that deep, and the cards mix things up a bit tactically.

Players are essentially battling over a row of flags, where victory is decided by whomever can assemble the best fighting formation on their side of each flag.  Some very tough decision making here, as you are fighting over 9 flags simultaneously, so you have all kinds of fronts to think about at the same time!

Tough decisions and a tense game right to the end!  The game can swing in one's favor very unexpectedly, so the battle is never over 'til it's over.

Updated 5/26/10.

I'm leaving everything that I had previously written up, because it is all true, and I'm keeping Battle Line's rating as a solid 8, because it deserves it.  But since playing Parade two-player, I rarely go back to this game anymore.  Consequently, it is no longer in my Top 10.  That is all.

I'm really surprised about this game.  I prefer board games to card games as a general rule, and I was especially skeptical knowing this card game primarily relies on suited, numbered cards and a modified poker-hand hierarchy.  I bought it mainly thinking that it would a quick, brainless time-killer on days where my wife and I are too tired to even handle Vikings.  

Instead, this turned out to be a really fabulous game.  It's often as tense and AP-inducing as Agricola, but in a 15-minute (actually 45-minute, as we'll play 2-3 games in a row), no-setup package.  

It's not for everyone - it's not terribly deep or strategic.  It's just a really great playing experience.  It's everything I could want in a board game, minus a board, fancy wooden bits, and 2 hours (give or take).  All for $12.

Simple yet deep game, requiring a combination of planning, card counting, and adaptability to your opponent's play.  I believe the Tactics cards, and how you are restricted in deploying them, add enough unpredictability to the base 'Schotten Toten' skin to make it that much more enjoyable (sometimes frustrating).

PLayed a couple of games with Morgan while she was here Nannying.  I liked it, but she didn;t understand the poker hands.  Would be a gem that Heather likes I think.  Need to just make her sit down once to play it.

This turns out to be a real brain burner of a game.  You guess and second guess yourself.  Even better than Lost Cities for second guessing what your opponent is going to do.  So simple but brilliant.  I loved it.  Heather, not so much.  We played with Basic rules but switched to advanced (where you can only claim a battle at the beginning of our turn) and that makes it harder but better for using the Tactics cards.  I don;t think Heather will play this game again (or at least she claims she won't) 11/12/09  This does not change my opinion of this game.

A bit dry, but I don't know of any two-player game that creates more tension (approaching brain-burning tension) than this one--and that's a good thing, when you're up for it. For a similar concept, but scaled-down, that is still a lot of fun, try Richard Garfield's Pecking Order.

More analyzable and stressful than Lost Cities, to which it bears a superficial resemblance. This may eventually be a 10. Surprisingly deep for how simple it is. I prefer to play without the tactic cards, which make it too swingy and chaotic.

RATING: 10
This really has everything I want in a 2 player game. It's quick and confrontational... it's full of agonizing decisions and the luck factor keeps it extremely replayable. There's a high level of tension here that really makes the hand management game one of the best around (probably my favorite of all time). There's so much to consider on every turn... trying to decide if it's worth it to sacrifice a flag so you can play cards you know your opponent needs in order to claim a flag elsewhere, trying to plan ahead to avoid filling all the spaces up too fast, and trying to figure out how it will hurt you least to play a card when you know it's going to sting no matter what. I'm always, always happy to play this.

Update: This is one of the first two player only games I ever acquired, and still my favorite. I don't think I've ever been like "Nah, let's NOT play BattleLine." So for that 10 = earned.

Played as Schotten Totten. This game is the very definition of tension. Just a little too long for the luck to even out over a reasonable time (too many games end with 50/50 draws - if I pull the blue 7 first I win, if not you win), but it's even more fun when you draw poorly.

Certainly feels like there is a large second player advantage. Would like to see some data on that.

[u]May 2009:[/u] I just bought this. I had heard about it a lot and never was interested, nor was I about its counterpart Lost Cities. However, I gave Lost Cities as a christmas present to my parents (poor they, they were playing rummikub...). So I got to play with my dad. I didn't like it much. Beginning of May, I brought my girlfriend to my parents and we played together and she LOVED IT, so much that I bought Battle Line (the better version if I believe what is said here on the 'geek). In fact, I found myself enjoying it too.

We'll see about Battle Line, but if it's better than its little brother Lost Cities, I'm sure I'm going to love it.

[u]June 2009:[/u] After 6 plays, I'm not sure yet I prefer this game to Lost Cities. I'm actually starting to think the contrary. Anyway, I like the game but I just don't really see myself playing over and over again as I do with Blue Moon or Race For The Galaxy.

[u]August 2010:[/u] Yep, 15 plays in, I definitely prefer playing Lost Cities. I also prefer playing the game without the tactic cards which we always do now. The game is a lot more tense (we feel) without those and this has raised my opinion of the game.

I never understood why people like this game so much... "The best 2 player game"? No way! Sure you can use tactics and a bit of strategy, but it's just not funny to me. Also, the gameplay feels limited when you only play a card and then draw a new one. The luck of the draw plays a part too.

The tactic cards are cool and add something to the game and are the reason I give this a 4 and not a 3. Also, the parallel to poker isn't really accurate imo, though there are some very small similarities. I really don't understand how come this game can be in the top 100 games!

My criterion for rating games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: This game is the same each time you play it except the cards you draw, but you see most of the cards every game.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. This game is full of meaningful decisions. Which card to play where is what the game is all about.

3) Player interaction:  For a game of its type it has a lot interaction in playing off of each other's cards and deciding which sets to play on each flag.  

4) Components/artwork:  Great artwork on the cards and nice quality cards.

5) Game length/complexity:  Perfect length game. Not too complex to teach a newbie, but lots of interesting tough decisions and even some use of logic.

Battle Line is a great two player game.  It is easy to learn (three minutes or less), yet involves a great deal of strategy.  Playing with the character cards is optional, but it makes the game that much more fun.  This has been a hard one to put down.

Great little fun game when you need to kill a few minutes with another player. It has just enough strategy to make me think, but not too heavy if I am in the mood for a lighter game.

I have never played with the tactics cards - I like the base game as it is...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So far, a modest pleasure, but the tactical and strategic interest of this game hasn't hit me hard on the first few plays.  Seems to be largely a game of hoping that your cards allow you to hang back enough to respond to where your opponent commits.  It lacks the mathy element of Lost Cities that I like; here the numbers on the cards come into play principally only as enabling their combination with similarly marked cards, rather than as something to calculate with. That's a minus.

Battle Line is simply one of the best two-player-only card games that I've played. It's straight up better than Lost Cities, and it feels like there's more direct competition, which for me, is a clear positive!

Battle Line shares the same advantage of Lost Cities--on your turn, you play a card, then draw a card. But with Battle Line, you are playing multiple "mini" poker hands against your opponent. This creates a wonderful tension of wanting to get your good cards out, but not sharing too much information too soon.

You can play the game two ways... with or without the tactics cards. They add some interesting surprises and a bit more chaos. 

My wife and I racked up 10+ plays in a matter of two days. This one is definitely a keeper.

Classic Knizia.  Plays medium to heavy, but offers one of the best playtime to brain-burning ratios of anything out there.  I play without Tactics cards.  My only qualm is that sometimes I just want something lighter and more filler-y.

I am used to playing Schotten Totten. It is a great game. It is a simple game of trying to make poker combinations to beat your opponents combinations.

RATING: 10
This is a fabulous game with just the right mix of luck and decision making.  Cards are arranged in groups a little like poker hands, but visible to both players.  Once you have played your cards to a group, you may claim victory for it as soon as you can logically prove that your opponent cannot do better, based on which cards are as yet unplayed.  We love this game and never play just one game.

Big hit with the girlfriend will see it coming back to the table; always interesting to play.

Gripping, tense, cerebral game with moments of  high octane concentration and "if this then that or this" mind work.  If you like poker you will probably find the basic idea 2nd nature to you (mini 3 v 3 card poker battles, with extra suits).  I enjoy the Tactics cards quite a bit.  This is a wonderful game. I use small rocks instead of the pawns ("flags"). //Updated, it dropped a point because we haven't played it in a year, and that seems the main point of the ratings. Maybe we don't play it because it feels like such a contest of wits, a serious game competition without lightness.  Still, I like the game.

The most magically infuriating game to play. This game will provide you with more analysis paralysis than any game I can think of.

It is hard to put your finger on what makes this game so interesting.  There are about three rules to remember, the gameplay is smooth, but there is still something missing from the game, and the tactics cards don't do it for me. 

I have come to prefer the added layer of resource management in Magnate, along with the push your luck feel of hording resources from the taxman.  Both games are dry-as-a-bone abstracts, but I think Magnate has added just the right amount of luck to the mix.  I will really miss the clever, prove-that-you-can't-beat-this column mechanic, however.

RATING: 7
This seems like such a simple design...but Knizia has done it again. This is a wonderful two-player battle of wits. The choice to draw from either deck, and to only be able to play one more Tactics card than your opponent has played provides a great tension and additional dimension of decision-making. 

Some of the information manipulation is reminiscent of Lost Cities, but I believe Battle line has more complexity to it, particularly since you can win with a "break-through" of 3 consecutive flags. There is plenty of strategy to ruminate on during play. That said, it plays breezily and satisfyingly. If you enjoy Knizia games and are looking for 2-player stuff...I'd put Battle Line in the "must have" category.

This is a very simple, yet brilliant game. In essence, you are completing three-card poker hands. The strategy comes from the following: (1)where you place these tricks on the table; (2) when you decide to place your cards; and (3) where you decide to place your throw-away cards.

Decent 2 player filler but I don't get all the fuss over what is simple card set matching.

Everything depends on what cards come up and you need to adjust for that and hold off showing your hand too early.

Better than Texas Hold 'em.  I'd rather play with Hoplites any day.  Theme is implemented rather well (in a roundabout, subtle way), loosely simulating ancient battle tactics of breakthrough and envelopment.  Can be a little bit of a brainburner in terms of analyzing possible plays and future contests and the cards are terrible- printed on the cheapest cardstock I've ever seen in my life.  Other than that, it's an excellent game and will replace Lost Cities in my collection as it is much more interesting.  The main problem I have is that the end of the game seems already decided by the time you get there, sort of like how solitare has a certain threshold where you've just lost the game due to a couple of mistakes.  Not really a "fun" game, but definitely worth a shot. The tactic cards are great, go home anti-chaos crybabies!

Worlds better than Lost Cities for a gamer.  Even suitable for a non-gamer after one learning game.  Two differing victory conditions allow for more than one strategy.  Plays so quickly.

Um enorme quebra cabeças para duas pessoas, com roupagem de Poker!
Temos frentes de batalha, e visamos fazer formações (jogos), com 3 cartas cada, mais fortes do que o do oponente para ganhar cada Bandeira individualmente. As formações são as mesmas do poker, straight flush, sequências, etc., com cartas curingas que podem alterar como as formações se comportam. Uma formação só ganha da outra quando fica provado, pelas cartas visíveis, que não tem como o oponente ganhar com a formação imediatamente à frente. Quando consegue 3 bandeiras consecutivas ou 5 alternadas, o jogador vence.
O que deixa mais desafiador é que, necessariamente, temos que jogar uma carta e comprar uma carta após o jogo, muitas vezes precisando sacrificar formações e fazer decisões bem difíceis. Além do fato de que, cada formação, normalmente, só tem 3 slots e não é permitido trocar.

Another two player game.  Players take turns playing a card then drawing a card.  The goal is to win either 3 contiguous rows or 5 of 9 rows by having the winning set of a max of 3 cards in 9 different rows.  Sets are valued along the lines of poker hands.  Tactics cards can add a bit of viciousness but you can only play one more than the other player has played which mitigates the advantage they can lend.

Avoided this one for a long time, looked pretty dry and too abstract for me.

Finally bought it as I'm always after 2 player games as I mainly game with my wife.

What a cracking game!

Such a simple game that offers some great tactical decision making right through to the end.  The pleasure gained from claiming a flag based on open information is a mini game of it's own and it is easy to miss a claimed flag if you're not paying attention.

Helen is not too keen on the tactics cards so I only get to play one or two in any given battle but I think she's starting to see the game changing fun of them.

It's hard to argue against this being an abstract game with a pasted on theme.  I do feel however that although there is no narrative theme the feeling of a battle for the line of flags is strong and you feel like you're making ground with each small victory.

Highly recommended to both new and seasoned gamers, a must have for any collection.

With the right opponent, this could be one of the best two-player card games ever.  Sometimes feels a little bit too random so it is best played as a 3 or 5 game series.  Like Lost Cities, choosing which card to play can be an agonizing experience.  Games can be rather close at times, which tends to make the "one more game" effect come into play.  I don't play this game much since my wife doesn't like it (Samurai is her favorite Knizia game), but when I can find a good opponent, this card game can be an addictively blissful experience.

October 2007 - Played a couple times now with oldest son and wife.  Think this is over my son's head.  Wife and I battle well and the tactic cards make it even more grueling.  Easy two player game to play.  Its amazing how many decisions are being made over a card game this simplistic.

Way better than Lost Cities.

I wasn't even crazy about the original, Schotten-Totten.  But while I like the retheming of this one, I dislike all of the changes to the game. Also, while the card art is decent if unexciting, the quality of the cards themselves are significantly worse than Schotten-Totten cards.

Marta hates this one (we've gotten into fights twice BOTH during 2 of 4 times we've played this game).  I enjoy it immensely, the only problem is the "proving aspect of it" that seems difficult to grasp for her, even though I've explained it on many occassions.

RATING: 6.5
This 2-player strategy game has some definite interesting points.  You want to win one of 9 flags by eventually laying down the best 3-card combination (straight flush is best, followed by 3 of a kind, and so on).  But you can't claim the flag until you can prove - based on the cards already out there - that you can't be beat.

In a way this is playing Balloon Cup where you try to "lock" a tile, but Battle Line adds the "must prove" element so it's not so simple.

I think I liked it, but would need to play it more to get underneath the strategies.  I did find that the discussions/arguments about proving you can win a flag get a little too nasty for my taste.  Maybe not the best game to play against the one I love!

RATING: 8.5
Although a recent acquisition, this has quickly become a favorite for my wife and me. A card game by appearance, it actually seems to play more like an abstract.

Knizia's habit of forcing players to make plays that they really don't want to make is in full force here but this can be mitigated by trying to leave all options open until the last possible moment.

Tactics cards can radically change the outcome of a game.

RATING: 8
Like so many Knizia games, it's a bucketload of "do I have to make a play?" painful-fun. I'm still figuring out whether I like the Tactics cards. Their power and variability both seem excessive...but at the same time, their presence creates a light pressure of uncertainty in the board position which I feel enhances the gameplay.

A very good 2-player game. Fast paced, easy to understand, highly portable(very good for going on holidays) and a lot of strategy in it for such a small game :). The tactic cards also add variety to the game. I gave it a 9 because the cards are pretty bland, would have enjoed a more diverse artwork.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Components: The artwork is detailed, but somewhat lost in the white space of the card. The special cards are very blah. Cards are sub-par quality.

Experience: Has the same tension of Schotten-Totten, hoping to draw the right cards, to delay having to play. The action cards add some uncertainty to a game that is already perfect; they are fun, but unneeded.

Rated low because I see no reason to play this over Schotten-Totten.

An ingenious, brain-burning duel of simultaneous trick-taking and tactical maneuvering. It looks boring as hell but every single moment of the game is interesting and agonizing.

Being color blind, I can't really tell the pastel colors well enough apart to differentiate the "suits" (and color is the only thing differentiating them). In fact the color is so bad that color sighted people are struggling to tell the colors apart, meaning I can get neither the color blind nor the color sighted to play this game.

In my opinion, that makes this game fit the official 1 definition. Broken, unable to be played.

Looking forward to playing this again.

The mechanics 'play one, draw one' are identical to Lost Cities, though the toys are very different as are the rules.

There's a similar sense of 'constantly showing your hand', making playing 2nd probably advantageous. 

The multiple victory conditions keep it exciting - giving a constant chance of victory and stopping the game if it ever becomes too hopeless. Playing against an experienced player, I never felt as hopeless as I did  during my 2nd game of Lost Cities against Gregor. 

There's obviously a lot of strategy to learn in placing numbers correctly and a bit of luck in the tactics cards. A better player can choose to nearly-eliminate the luck factor if they want though, thanks to the rule that you can only play one more than your opponent - a brilliant masterstroke.

Frankly, I think my mind is blown by how good this is.

My son and I play this game all the time. We are very even, and the games are almost always tight. The game concept is very easy to learn, but the strategy takes time to master.

Along with Lost Cities, one of the best two-player games to play with people who really aren't much into games. Or when you have 20-30 minutes to kill and don't feel like watching TV. Although Lost Cities is good, this one is a little better, as Lost Cities can be frustrating if you don't see good cards -- here you have at least a few options because no card is really bad if played in the right combination.

You won't feel like you're doing battle, but as long as you don't go into it expecting that (it's Knizia after all), you can enjoy it.

Evokes a similar feeling as Lost Cities, in that you must play a card every turn, even if you don't have a good play. It's actually easier to teach than Lost Cities, because there is no scoring.

This is a great game. I heard it described as comparable to Lost Cities, and now that I've played it I don't really agree. The two have some superficial similarities, but I feel Battle Line is better in every way. It's fast, there are lots of tough decisions to make and mind-games to play with your opponent. The tactics cards add some great high-powered weapons to your arsenal, but the rules cleverly allow your opponent to restrict your use of these cards, if they wish. I love the theme, too, despite being almost totally disconnected to the game. This game is cheap and widely available - try it!

I love the pacing of this game. Every decision gets more and more stressful and tense, and the whole game builds until it reaches a climactic end. No points counting, no guessing who's in the lead. When it ends, it just ends.

It also has a surprisingly fitting theme. When I first played, it I thought it was really pasted on, but after a bit of reflection, it really does perfectly convey the tension of a battle (not a war). The feeling of having your perfectly formed line slowly collapse, and knowing you have a limited supply of reinforcements, and having to make hard compromises about your formation given the time pressure. No other war-themed game I've played has captured that tension and stress nearly as well.

Great game. The always-diminishing play options are like the inexorable progression of doom!!  The battle line is formed and, at first, you are free to commit your troops to take or defend any flag.  As the game progresses, play-space tightens and eventually, you must commit fully or sacrifice your men to the enemy.  Commit too soon and tip your hand to the enemy and he will be prepared to counter your advance; too late, and you may come up short. Lunch Hour Game of the Week, 03/30 - 04/04.

Good 2-player filler. Has enough depth for new strategies and tricks to emerge with further play but not enough to bog it down. The addition of the Tactics cards adds some valuable uncertainty compared to ST and also ups the pace since there's now added incentive to complete a win before its scrambled by a bad Tactics card.

Fine-tuning the rank.

[April 2015 - 8.4]
Moves up a couple of notches. It's a great little mechanic that should be part of more games.  You'll love and hate it at the same time.

[October 2014 - 8]
Such a simple game, yet it can illicit a lot of thought and emotions (highs and lows) throughout the game. And while there's little theme, there is that sense of trying to break your forces through the line. My suggestion when you play, don't over-think it. I really enjoy this game while waiting at an airport or in a bar -- you can put as much thought into it as you feel like. One house rule we play with is to allow the discard of a card into a battle that has already been resolved but still has an open space for a card. That way the final battles are still competitive without devolving into what amount to forfeits because you have to place a useless card in an ongoing battle.

If I want to play a short 2 player game this is what I reach for.  Tense with tough decisions throughout.  Continues to be rewarding every time I play.  Nice element of bluff and deception.  Only problem is that the theme is poorly implemented.  Theme actually makes the game more difficult to teach instead of tying the rules together.

Yet another yawner Knizia "effort" that only a card-counter could love. One of the most laughable lines I've read on this site captures all the things I despise about this game: "...in a unique twist, you may use your powers of logic to claim a stone even before your opponent has played all three ... cards...." Powers of logic? Technically [and marginally] true. It's a card counting/memory game for people who think they're too "smart" or "sophisticated" to just play rummy. Only highlight to this is that GMT can use the tithes from Knizia acolytes to underwrite far more entertaining and challenging games [like the GBoH series]

Well, it's a Knizia, and a good one at that.  In a way similar, but a lot deeper and generally much better than Lost Cities.  Just ditch the tactics cards, they don't add anything meaningful to the game, only complicate it needlessly.

This is one of my favorite 2 player games only I cannot play it with casual gamers because the outcome will be predictable.  At the same time, I have noticed heavy gamers take a little too long for my taste with each move (due to the great strategic implications of your moves).  All in all, this is a very excellent 2-player game.

Mostly abstract game similar to Lost Cities.  You try to avoid committing too much to a column until you can win it.  Once one player commits though it is hard to stop the opponent from following you with better cards as he know what he needs to win.

Still I think it is better than Lost Cities.  I like the special event cards even though they do introduce a good bit of randomness.

RATING: 7
With US companies plundering Knizia titles and republishing them, we see Schotten-Totten appear as Battleline.  This is a very clever two player game where players play mini-poker hands of three cards against positions in the battle line.  If you win three in a row, or any five, you've defeated the enemy.  Another glimpse at Knizia's genius with a few simple components and rules.

A fun game, it reminds me a lot of Lost Cities (same designer).  The box is oversized for the amount of components you get, but if you take them out of the box, the game is very portable. The cards are not normal card stock, they're thicker and much more difficult to riffle shuffle.

A lot of thinking for this simple game is required.  It can be quite challenging.  Instead of talking in terms of Wedge and Battalion, I think in terms of flush, 3 of a kind, and straight.  LOL.  Update: After about 30 playings, this game is a quick-play gem.  Glad I got it, and play it now.  Originally a 7, but I moved it to an 8.  Then, after playing it even more ... I've rated it a 9.

RATING: 9
Idea:
Play cards in different rows to form combinations of numbers/colors to beat opponents combination in same row. Win 5/9 rows or 3 adjacent rows to win game

Mechanism:
Both players play card at a time (1-10, 6 colors) out of 7 in hand to form strongest(=hardest) combinations. Real key to the game are 10 special cards that can be drawn instead of normal card BUT you can play only 1 more special card than your opponent. Thus if you play one, you cant play more unless your opponent does! That makes really much more possibilities for strategies.

to who:
Awesome game, better than Lost Cities by far! Really strong 1on1 game. One of my wifes favourites and is very easy to take on when travelling.

This is an enoyable game that I should play more than I do.  I like the poker-like nature of the formations.  I enjoy it both with and without the tactics cards, but find it more exciting with the latter (be sure to remember the rule that you may only play 1 more Tactics card than your opponent has played!). BL is rather similar to Lost Cities in that you often face the prospect of chosing where you'll have to screw yourself.  This one is more confrontational than LC though.  UPDATE 5/2006 - after playing this regularly with my wife, I'm bumping my rating up to a 9!  The tactics and depth are really starting to come through for us as we get better at the game.  It often comes down to someone winning by a single turn.  We are now very stingy with the use of tactics cards, as we don't want to let each other play them.

Easily one of my favorite two-player games. Easy to teach (recommend creating simple reference sheet for the different formations,) but deceptively deep strategy (Lost Cities to the extreme.) As you must play a card every turn, you're constantly forced to reveal information to your opponent. You don't want them to know that you've got a powerful hand planned for the middle row, but are going to throw some garbage on the rightmost one - but you need to put down something.

I couldn't recommend this game enough to anyone whose got regular opportunity for 2 player games - Knizia knows how to take a large serving of strategy, add a dash of luck, and produce amazing results.

Purchased from Favorite Local Game Store at Favorite Local Gaming Convention.  Had a great time during our first trial run.  I'm not sure whether or not I prefer this game to Schotten-Totten.  The difference is the tactics cards, and I'm not quite sure I like the way they change the game; they're just a little chaotic.  On the other hand, they do add--well, tactics!

Tried this out for the first time recently and I have to say that it's a hard game to refuse, win or lose.  It plays super fast and while thematically weak, it's got just enough risk-taking and tactical thinking to be appealing.  I picked it up on a whim given that everything I read about it didn't make it seem all that interesting, but I felt like picking up something new anyway.  After a couple of plays, I now understand what people are talking about.  This is simply a great little card game that doesn't really need its theme, but the additional tactics cards are great game-changers, providing some entertaining swings at the table.

Battle line is an intense 2 player game with really simple rules, a quick flow of play but plenty of depth.  The decisions over what cards to play where can be agonising and the tactics cards mix things up nicely.  I like the rule that limits use of tactics cards to just one more than your opponent has played.  I also like the dual winning condition - not only gaining 5 flags but also achieving 3 in a row.  The icing on the cake with this one is that my wife really likes playing it.

This is an interesting game to move up from always playing Lost Cities. Basically, you're trying to build competing piles of cards (almost like small poker hands) in different areas to win pawns. Good interaction and deduction possibilities, and the special cards add a little unpredictability. 

The downside is that it becomes like the scene in The Princess Bride ("so clearly I cannot choose the glass in from of you, except...") where some players may just decide there's too much analysis to be done for a game of this weight.

Also: an extra demerit for the lousy clip-art on the cards. Bad art! No biscuit!

I ended up trading it away.

Battle Line is a great card game. Knizia can really make great games and I think part of that comes with the fact that he creates interesting win conditions. In the case of Battle Line this means both combat win conditions and end game winning conditions.  The art is a little bland, but if it's that much of a problem you can try Schotten Totten or one of the Battle Line's user created alternate art options here in the BGG files section.

Finally got around to playing this. It is full of decisions and on more than one occasion I was wondering why I had used a Tactics card the way I had instead of waiting. Was able to fall back and regroup. Loved the choices to be made...the different avenues to win...the discussions on troop card resolutions to be had...and the suspense of final troop resolutions to be made. Listed as but does not feel like a war game...but it was a fun play nevertheless.

Finally had the opportunity to play this game and was able to whip up on my buddy.  Always a plus.  I like the back and forth of the game and the need to keep track of what has and has not been played.  Not sure I like the tactical cards all that much but might start to use them if my normal strategy starts to wane.

RATING: 10
Update: This game has truly earned the rating of 10, as I play it so much I do not even consider my fairly extensive two player game collection before suggesting Battle Line. If you buy one two player card game make it Battle Line.

This game of numbers and colors is Knizia at his very best. 

It's still a very good game with impressive depth and replayability. It's not over until the end, have won and lost many a game after getting far ahead or behind. 

Another testament to its staying power is that I can't win. I probably lose about 3 of 4 lately. For whatever reason this intrigues me. I guess I like punishment. 

Update 2: I am no longer a strong proponent of not using the advanced rule. The game is strong either way, I still prefer no advanced rule for the sake of consistency, but I would play with it.

The basic system, as taken from Schotten Totten, has strong tactical and strategic elements, which makes for a good game. But more importantly, Battle Line throws in a decent enough theme and adds the tactical cards, and the theme integration is pretty good. As a two-player war-themed card game, way better than Lightning: Midway or Lightning: D-Day.

RATING: 8
Playing this reminds me of the old saw about pro basketball, that you only need to watch the last five minutes because that's when the game will always be decided.  In many games of Battle Line, the game seems to be decided on who is able to draw the cards they need at the very end.  But the end game is a reflection of the foundation.  Smart early play will create small advantages at the end - sure, you can still be beaten by lucky draws now and then, but you'll win more than you lose if you plan it out properly.  Every card played gives information to your opponent and limits your future opportunities, so each turn can be beautifully agonizing.

The game does lack interaction between the players' card draws.  That's why I prefer the tactics cards, despite the lack of balance.  Also, the advanced scoring rules are helpful, because they encourage the use of the tactic cards, which otherwise seem to never get played by whichever player feels like they have a slight advantage.

I'm enjoying this and it seems to go over well with everyone I introduce it to.  The best filler I have come across.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm always on the lookout for short, clever two-player games for my wife and I to play. Battle Line fits the bill.

The poker-style set comparison is easy to learn. The ability to hide your intent until the second card of three is played creates opportunities for misdirection.

The game does not offer much variety. Its strength is in the simplicity of its mechanic. I recommend it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impressions - not great value for money. Card stock is thin and only other components are 9 small wooden pawns.

However, gameplay (fortunately) makes up for this. Think - Lost Cities with more decisions and more conflict (in the nicest possible sense of the word!)

My wife picked it up immediately and loves it (probably 'cos she beats me most of the time...)

Tactics cards are a good way of giving a player who doesn't pick great cards, a chance of winning.

Still just a card game, but plays quickly with good replay value.

RATING: 8.5
English version of German Schotten Totten (see flexgames.com).  One of the most popular light two-player games, more fun and more interesting choices than Lost Cities.  It certainly packs considerable tension into a small game, although there is potential for AP.  Very tense and agonizing decisions!  Has elements reminiscent of Lost Cities, Balloon Cup, Poker, and Rummy.  Haven't yet played with the Tactics cards, but I can imagine they would mitigate the luck element, which can be slightly frustrating (sometimes it's down to both players hoping to draw a certain card which will complete a formation).  We currently play with the advanced rule or official variant that flags can only be claimed at the very beginning of your turn before playing a card (which allows opponent a turn to react by dumping a card or using Tactics cards), rather than the original rule that flags can be claimed during your turn after playing a card but before drawing a card.

Find Schotten Totten too constrained, so prefer Battle Line, though usually play without Tactics.

One of the best 2 player games I have. Great when you just want to go head to head and play a quick but thinky game to a definitive win, instead of counting points. You're always making tough decisions and sacrifices that you hope end up going your way. My main gripes are the mediocre artwork and lack of suit symbols, as it's difficult to play with my colorblind father (which is who I bought it to play with). Some of the Tactics card text could be explained better too. Would definitely be a 9 otherwise.

You can't deny that if you draw crap cards, you're SOL, but as long as you draw semi decent cards and play them smart, you should be able to hold on until you get the cards you need to win.

If I've only got a little bit of time to play, or I don't particularly want to play something that requires balancing an incredible amount of things within my head, this is a terrific 2-player game. I also see that there is a very viable 3-player variant.

There was more strategy than I first expected, and that's greatly appreciated, because it's still a rather simple game and the depth is easy to see and implement.

This is and Parade are my favorite 2-player "filler" size games.

An evil little game, filled with many tough decisions. The design incorporates hand management, with a significant level of decision angst. Simple to learn, difficult to master, always good as a filler between heavier games. Is Battleline a wargame? Well, I'd say "no." More accurately, it's poker with a warlike theme pasted on. Battles over objectives are fough using poker hands. 

If you like the Lost Cities card game, do yourself a favor and try this one out too! If you like quick playing brain burners, try this game immediately!

Played 1 time. The action cards are silly. In the game my friend and I played, we started off by only drawing action cards, and I drew the one that allowed me to draw 3 cards - so I drew three action cards, returned to numbered cards to the top of the deck (ensuring I would get back the one I wanted and only give a 1 to my friend). Without the action cards the game would be a little dry. Which means the game is not so great. And the card quality is poor. I think I preferred Schotten-Totten (though it was so long ago, I can't remember why); and I think I would prefer Caesar & Cleopatra as well, since the action cards are integrated better into the game.

This is not a redevelopment of Schotten-Totten; this is Schotten-Totten under a different name and look.  The version of S-T I got has exactly the same tactics cards with the exact same card distribution and effects.  This is not a bad thing by any means as I think this is a brilliant game.  It develops slowly and much like Lost Cities, the charm lies in not revealing too much all the while trying to stake your claims before your opponent divines your plans.  Excellent game.

Aggressive poker - fairly fast, fun, and with quite a bit of depth (especially with the Tactics cards).

Duration: Fast with little downtime.
Design: Essentially poker with sets of 3, played into a cramped field.
Strategy: There's a decent amount in here; some bluffing, sacrifice, positional plays, luck-pushing.
Components: Fair; the art is faux-classical.
Theme: The Troop card themes were utterly pasted-on, the Tactics cards slightly less so.

Update:  Give me this over Lost Cities, easier rules to explain and much, much easier scoring.    Simple and excellent.  Three adjacent pegs for a win provides a threat and a focus to the game.  Addictive and fast. 

I love the theme of the ancient battles and have no idea why I like Lost Cities better than this game.  I wonder if it's because in Lost Cities I can play with more aggression and in Battle Line I feel like I'm simply trying not to play cards as long as possible. It seems like a game of stalling and waiting for good draws.  Did GMT reuse the artwork from the counters in Commands and Colors Ancients for this game?  They sure look the same to me.  Battle Line is a game my wife likes to play so I'm happy to have it on the shelf and I really do enjoy it when we get it out.  I would reccomend this game to anyone and consider it a gateway game for traditional card players.

Update:  This has been popular of late because it's so simple, We're having lots of fun.  We tend to play without the tactics cards.  I'm raising it 7-->8

(Battle Line, GMT 2004 Reprint) Another well-regarded game reprinted without much love (like FFG's Colossal Arena). C'mon, are we never gonna see linen-finish cards from a US publisher? And what's with the price point? It's just 70 cards and 9 nondescript pawns. Anyway, as for the game... Not exactly my 2P game of choice. There's a lot of randomness here, with added "take that" play from the Tactics cards (some of which are a lot better than others: Alexander vs. Companion Cavalry, for example). Can tolerate a game or two now and then, but mostly unimpressed. Can imagine a Schotten-Totten game - that's probably even more boring. A far cry from RK's best 2P game, LOTR:TC.

Set matching poker style. This game is strategic, all card driven and has a set of cards used for breaking the rules with a catch, you can only play 1 more than your opponent. The game plays as a sort of capture the flag match, once a flag is claimed, it can't be taken away, and cards that break the rules (tactics cards) cannot be used to determine that a flag can't be claimed. All one needs to do is prove they have one the flag without the chance to lose their claim and it's theirs.

I may update this later but the person I play with isn't great at traditional card games. So I kept finding my self explaining the formations and which formations beat what. So I had a negative experience with this one ... but that is more my play and nothing against the game.

Very intense and fun game for 2. only takes 30mins. Not recommened for wives. Also its not a very beautiful game but it is effective (artwork seems circa 1973 rather than current) this is my only gripe. yes it is a deeper "lost cities" and what a great 30 min rush!

Gyakorlatilag ugyanaz, mint a schotten totten, de szerintem szebb. A második kiadás kártyái nagyon jó minőségűek, egyszerű, letisztult a grafika. Eggyel több lap van benne minden színből, mint a st-ben.
Egyszerűsége ellenére egy nagyon összetett gondolkodós játék. Talán az egyik legjobb kétszemélyes játék. Nem kell félni a Knizia-hatástól, ez teljesen más játék, mint az elveszett városok, vagy a keltis.

Really fun two player game.  Has the feel of a standard knizia Game where you have choices of what card to play in your seven card hand, but you have 60 more cards to go through and you don't know what you are going to get so you don't know which ones to play.  It feels like you have more control over the game than you really do.

A really solid 2-player that's fast, portable and highly strategic, filling a niche few other games can. Somewhat hilariously antisocial, as most game involve two people sitting in silence across from each other, glowering at their cards and only very occasionally looking up to glower at one another (usually when a traitor or fog gets played).

I feel like I have more control, and hence, more thoughtful plays than in Lost Cities. In my opinion, the theme and art are ho-hum, though. I like it a lot and my wife likes it even more. She gives it a 7-8 but asks to play it often. (She's a tougher rater than I)

RATING: 8
Excellent two player card game of building formations of 3 cards each at one of nine battle locations (flags) by alternating playing one card at a time.  The win conditions of 5 of 9 flags or 3 consecutive flags create a lot of tension and interesting choices.

A very fast, but sufficiently deep game. It got overplayed a bit, which is a problem I generally have with shorter games. Nevertheless, it is a quite solid design.

RATING: 6.5
After a couple of plays I am beginning to see the underlying elegance of this game.  Easy to explain (it is just basically poker hands) and quick playing.  A fair amount of luck due to the card draws and the tactic cards are pretty powerful.  It has just the right amount of strategic depth for the amount of time it takes to play.

Battle Line has a very good thing going for it.  Unlike any other card game I can think of, you gain a point for not only building a winning hand, but proving through open information that your opponent cannot gain a better hand in the game.  As such, there is a lot of analysis in the game, which can cause some lag.  It is a brilliant design, though. Another smart card game from Knizia!

Battle Line is Schotten Totten with the addition of tactic cards.  The strength of Battle Line comes in the quick tactical play; decisions are not always obvious in this game as second guessing, growing information and luck all play a role in designing the next best move.  Similarities are often drawn between this and Lost Cities, and although I understand the claims both games to me play vastly different.  Battle Line doesn't force specific suits to be played on assigned piles so therefore creates the feeling of more control than Lost Cities. Where as in most games this would be a good thing, in a card game of this ilk I prefer the tense limitations of Lost Cities.  That's not to suggest Battle Line is a bad game, quite the contrary.  I enjoy Battle Line as a strong two player outing, but I will always call upon it's sibling if given the choice.

This is an excellent 2-player card game.  Game lenght, tension, variability are all there.  Highly recommended.  I can't imagine this game being nearly as fun without the tactics cards... they make the game a "8".  Without them, it's probably a 6.

Very fun 2-player game. My wife and I loved to play this, but after receiving a similar game called Four Tribes we decided to put it up for trade. When we compared both games we decided that if we had to scratch that itch, we would always pick Four Tribes over Battle Line. It is still an amazing game and I am sure others may not share my opinion and would prefer to play Battle Line instead, I love that about gaming!

RATING: 8
Have you every thought, hey wouldn't it be fun if there was a game which involved playing 9 hands of 3 card poker at the same time? Battle Line did it... and it's fantastic!

Battle line is a 2 player card game that pits two ancient generals against each other in tactical battle. Players must create combos of cards that out rank their opponent. When you complete a set of 3 you check to see if you can beat your opponent's combo. If your opponent can not outrank your combo, you'll win that flag. Out of the 9 flags you need 3 adjacent or 5 total to win the game.

Strategy and luck meld almost perfectly. You'll always be thinking about your next move, but be hoping desperately to get that one card you need. The game is indirectly competitive (aside from tactics cards). It's more about setting up your own combos rather than attacking your opponent directly which I like.

It's strategic and simple to pick up. It's competitive, but not too fierce. Battle Line balances all the aspects I love in board games. It will always have a special place on my shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
More choices than Lost Cities, one round is longer than a round of Lost Cities though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I usually find my leg unconsciously jittering while playing this game due to the immense tension.  Will I draw the card I need?  Which meld do I use this card for?  Do I commit a flag by playing a 2nd card or do I stall in hopes of something better by playing to another flag?  My only complaint is that, since you have to play/commit cards immediately, you almost always have to hope it's you who draws the card which completes the meld.  I usually play without the special cards as the basic game is excellent as it is.

[b][i]Battle Line[/i][/b] is a masterpiece of simplicity in design. It is somewhat similar to Lost Cities in scope and feel, but I prefer BL thanks to my perception that it is more strategical and less luck based than Lost Cities. BL is, however, "just" a simple card game and thus doesn't have the variety of strategies that characterize better-ranked board games.

The Tactics cards make Battle Line much better than its predecessor Schotten-Totten.

This is a fun one. Good 2 player action with classic cardgame elements. playing with just the main deck offers a good experience. It's a light game, but still the decisions can be painful to make. Eventually you're going to have to cut some of your losses when playing this game. The more you play the better you can set yourself up in anticipation of this. It's a quick 25 minute 2 player game. Fun enough to keep.

Alright, played the tactics cards. Pretty fun, gives you options in tough situations

A simple set collection game - draw cards and attempt to build poker style sets (three of a kind, straight, flush) in one of five available colours in front of nine available "battle" sectors.

The cards are not great from a production quality standpoint.  This edition has the GMT 'Clip Art' look to them that isn't exactly flashy, but is not too bad either.  I prefer Schotten now, especially since the more recent edition has Tactics cards as well and is better produced.  Either version is a fine choice though for a good game such as this.

Very seldom played.  It is difficult to sustain the illusion of a battle when your brain is telling you that you are really playing poker.

[b] Battleline[/b] [Reiner Knizia 2000[/i] :star: Print and Play Version
Good travel game and fantastic fast two players filler,  Knizia makes a simple idea works flawlessly, It is one of the most clever card games I had ever played.  An amazing battle with easy a simple to grasp rules in which players compete for the best play conquering banners. The first one to take five of them (or three in a row) is the winner of the game. I guess this is the simplest game in the top 100 but is still a sure winner. Easy to take away, is also a perfect choice for travels and trips, as long as you plan to play with only two persons. The cards have a good quality and the game is not very pricey (it can even be easily P&Ped but I dont think this is a need since a retails copy costs less than 15 euros). I own a retail copy and one redesign.

RATING: 9.5
Quickly becoming one of my favorite 2-player card games. It retains the feeling you get in Lost Cities when you have cards you can play but you want to wait until the game develops further before tipping your hand to your opponent. 

I have a strange relationship with the tactics cards. They are VERY powerful and can change the course of the game in an instant. This can be frustrating. However, the plays I have without them seem a little dull.

Very interesting strategy/deduction game. The theme is stretched a little thin, but the artwork and the tactics cards bring it back. It plays fast and there are some neat decisions to make. Hope to get this in trade somehow. :)

A good two-player game that seems under-appreciated. It's identical in play to Schotten-Totten, but with added tactics cards. I feel there are elements of Lost Cities, in that you must choose which battles to fight and are sometimes forced to play cards before you would really like. There's some nice tactical decisions to be made, and the game gets very interesting towards the middle as options get reduced.

Battle Line is one of the great two player card games. Instead of rummy inspirations, Battle Line has you playing poker hands of three cards along nine different locations. It is rewarding to take a location by proving a hand of yours cannot be beat. Additionally, the tactic cards through in the possibility of countering opponent's plans. Everything is very well balanced, and it is a rare game where players are playing against each other instead of competing to be the most efficient at an activity.

RATING: 8

RATING: 8
This game's playtime helps make it one of my most played games, but it wouldn't get played this much if it wasn't for the excellent balance of luck and strategy and the fact that it can be taught to just about anyone.  Knizia at his finest.

rating after one play - often seen described as Lost Cities for gamers.  This has a very different feel to it to me.  you play a card then draw a card just like in Lost Cities but the similarities end there.  You've got more categories in which you are competing. You've also got what are called formations, which are sets of cards kind of like rummy melds.  These formations are ranked so that some are more powerful than others.  So, while in Lost Cities, whoever has the most points in an expedition (i.e. a suit), in Battle Line you have more options with the formations.  Furthermore, in Lost Cities, your cards in expedition A are only competing against expedition A on your opponents side of the table.  Here, you play your cards wherever you find them to be most useful to you.  For example, one formation is called a batallion which is a set of cards of the same color (suit).  You may be competing for in a category for a flag against another batallion of the same color, or even a different color, or against another formation entirely such as a phalanx which is a higher rank formation.  And finally, you have tactics cards that give you special abilities.  In conclusion (to make this sound completely like a compare/contrast essay for a high school english class)...  Totally different games.  I like both.  Battleline has many more options so there is more room for tactical/strategic gameplay.

The roman combat theme is a smokescreen, but this is a really great abstract poker variant.  It is a hand management game above all else, with planning and odds guessing thrown in.  There is some luck of the draw which can be obnoxious, but it is so short you can play 3 or 4 games if you get hosed one game no big deal.  The GMT version has great bits for a 15 dollar game.  

This could be a great REAL gateway game to get poker players into board games.

Schotten Totten with a different design and an added ten card. I like this design more than ST and the tenth card might just make it a little bit better, but the box is far bigger than it should be and the game is not worth three times ST's pricetag (that's what it's going for last I checked).

I've only played Battle Line, not the original Schotten-Totten.  I guess the difference is the addition of Tactics cards, and cards valued 10, and perhaps the rule about when to claim flags.  I like the game because it requires both strategic and tactical play.  However, there is a fair amount of luck-of-the-draw, particularly in the Tactics deck.  If you draw several Tactics cards, they could be useless and just take up hand space, while your opponent draws a fantastic card like "Traitor".

The biggest problem for me with this game is that I don't play 2-player games often -- not usually my thing.

I was quite skeptical at first, but I enjoyed the game quite a bit and ended up playng the game 5 times in a row. However, I can see that the game probably doesn't have much replay value once you've played it enough, but it was certainly fun while it lasted.

Edit: This game is f'in brilliant. I believe at this point that this game is Knizia's masterpiece. After I bought it I played fifteenish games in two days. This game being as good as it is without a reliance on a credible theme makes me question my allegience to the Ameritrash. The bluffing of having cards you don't, the paranoia of others having cards that you need, the desperation of needing THAT ONE CARD that will win you the game. Amazing. The game is so accessible, my non-gamer dad read the rules in five minutes and put up a helluva fight. But there's also so much strategy, you will constantly be learning little tricks to improve your game.

I've never quite understood what Reiner Knizia's fascination with poker was all about, but it's certainly left us with some great games - like this one! It's such a great little card game that has some of the tension you'd expect from a battle front (and, somehow, a poker table as well).  You concentrate forces to flank your opponent or cut through the middle. You bluff, you play it safe, you take risks. The tactic cards are a nice added element which spice it up a bit more! I'm a big fan of allowing my opponent to play one first such that I prevent them from playing any more or am in a position to play two in a row.

It's a Knizia game, so don't expect theme.
But what it delivers is a very tense & tight two-player card game of number tactics & probability.

Good two-player game & my favorite Kniz game by far.

I usually love my Knizias. He has splendid mechanics in his games for the most part. I originally bought this game for three reasons: it was Knizia, it was a two-player game and it had good reviews. Well even if I appreciate the mechanic in this game (it's hard to better utilize elements of poker in a board game of any sort), I still found this game a bit boring. First of all, visually it's awful. But because I'm not exactly dwelling in 2-player games, I'm gonna stick with this until something similar but better come around.

RATING: 7
Battle Line is a re-theme of a basic mathematical game, one which Knizia has returned to more than once with freshly painted theme.

But for many this is the best implementation- and having played at least the Narnia re-theme I think I agree with that sentiment.

Basically, players pile card hands opposite score tokens, trying to win either 3 immediately adjacent tokens or 5 of 9 tokens to claim victory.

So what makes this version special- what makes a game so potentially simple special?

First, the theme works here- the feeling of warriors rushing the line of battle, and perhaps turning the tide of battle actually invokes a little feeling of the Iliad, and the art is nice, but not fanciful, so it retains more of a sense of realism than a tug of war between Scots or Caspian's fantasy battle with his Regent do.

The tactics/rule change cards also seem more realistic in terms of effect and play, so that players can change the fate of tokens in more strategic manner.  This makes the game play a little more interesting.

The formations/hand rankings also make a little more sense with the Battle Line artwork/theme.

If a themeless Knizia eurogame is not your thing, this is one of the better themed games that he has created.

Plus it plays quickly and easily, and it invites a rematch when the battle is done.

Battle Line represents a nice balance of theme and game for me, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome.

This is the kind of game that Knizia built his reputation on- a solid, replayable game, which rewards players and which wants to come out again and again.

Not a terrible 2-player game.  There is obviously some luck to it with what you draw, but tactics cards played at the right time mitigates this a bit. 

I can see this game getting a bit boring after a while so it's not an every week game, nor is it a game that I'd want to play at every 2 player game session I'd have.

Initial impression playing by myself: :snore: The tactics slow it down a little bit, but I think it's because I am still learning them. 

[b]Update:[/b] After playing a little bit with my wife, I still think it's so-so. I would rather play Jaipur, Lost Cities, RftG or Hive than this. It has more potential than I initially thought. Still, we both wound up grouchy after playing two games because it wasn't fun. 

[b]Update 2:[/b] It is now my wife's favorite small game and I do like it more. Still not my most favorite, but it's creeping up.

If it didn't take up so much horizontal space while playing this would be an excellent travel/pub game. I find it to be strictly superior to Lost Cities. We never play with the Tactics cards. (Tried it once and my girlfriend thought they made it too random.)

I was too long in appreciating Battle Line. I scoffed when Calandale said it was a good wargame, I played it and lost to my wife but didn’t consider it anything special.

Then I won. And it wasn’t that I had won, it was that I realized why I had won. And I understood that the game wasn’t only about getting a breakthrough or an envelopment; it was about focusing your strength on your strongest points, about using that push to outwait your enemy until he commited forces to an unopposed front: and then you one-upped him there. You concentrated your forces, left as many options free as you could, tried to get him to commit before you did. You made sure that you didn’t fail to send forces in where you could before the enemy took the high point, and you made sure you could win at the end of the battle by holding back reserves until you knew what the enemy had thrown against you on your unopposed fronts. And then you chose your reserves and slaughtered him.

And suddenly it was about breakthroughs and envelopments again. Holding back reserves for the final stroke meant launching a strong push now; waiting out the enemy to send in the reinforcements against his committed troops was the way to an envelopement.

I can’t get enough of Battle Line. I used to snigger at the acolytes of Reiner Knizia; I am still no Knizian, but I see where they’re coming from. This game alone earned him a place in my hall of great designers. That it is published by GMT is only the cream on top of the chowder.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

If you've only got half an hour & one opponent this is the game to play.  The simple rules & mechanics (play a card, draw a card) give rise to so much tension & difficult decision making.  There's absolutely no wasted time or effort here & the replayability is excellent.

This is certantly not a good game. 
First of all i don't see why this game is in the deduction category or at least it is too optimistic.
I seen somebody compared the game to poker. I've played a lot of poker and sees no realy similarities except the set collection which many games have.

Many standard children card games has a set collection element and this game is for me not much different. It can proberly be played with an oredinary deck of cards - assigning the king, quuens and jacks to the special deck.

RATING: 6
An unusual 2 player game that starts out as a heavy, poker-like game of optimising card placements across 9 hands, and on that level it's fascinating. By the end of the game, though, there's enough luck-of-the-draw to be really annoying. Leaving out the Tactic Cards would be an improvement IMO. A bit surprising that a flush beats a straight here, as a flush seems far easier to achieve.

RATING: 7
I've disliked many of the other two-player card games which are often mentioned in the same breath with this one, so I was surprised to find that Battle Line was quite enjoyable. It's a clever tug-of-war with several winning conditions, in which you must balance between preventing your opponent from winning and laying your own plans. What makes it interesting is that you have a pretty high degree of control, and choose when you want to draw cards and which type of card to draw.  Liked it, would play again. (1 play)

Cada jugador debe situar 9 formaciones de 3 cartas a lo largo de una línea de batalla (Battle Line). Cada formación está opuesta a la del contrario y el resultado depende de la fuerza de esta formación, que viene ordenada en una jerarquía similar a la del poker (escalera de color> poker> color> escalera> tres cartas cualesquiera). Ganará el jugador que tenga 3 formaciones ganadoras seguidas o 5 no contiguas. Todo esto jugado con un mazo de 60 cartas de 6 colores numeradas del 1-10 + 10 cartas de tácticas que alteran las formaciones de alguna manera especial. PROS Elementos en común con el Poker o Chinchón que le hacen fácil de aprender. El método deductivo para demostrar que serás el ganador de una jugada con independencia de lo que pudiera llegar a jugar el contrario. CONS Seco y abstracto con factor suerte por encima de la media. Cualquier cuentacartas lo encontraría sofisticado y analítico, pero yo no soy así.

Dropped my rating half a point. I know they are not nearly similar in game play, but I prefer [thing=986]Babel[/thing] to Battle Line. The theme of warrior tribes is the same, but the play and possibilities are so much more interesting in Babel.

I know a lot of people like this game but I just can't see why.  I was expecting it to be better than its predecessor, Schotten-Toten, but the strategy cards just made the game more annoying.  The lack of control in the game is frustrating and one player is always put on the counterattack for the entire session.  Basically, there’s a whole list of reasons why I think this game is no better than a hand of poker.  Please tell me I'm not the only one who feels this way.

Very smart two-player game.  It's the "gamer's" version of Schotten Totten (which it evolved from).  The ability to use the Tactics cards to influence your opponent's side of the board adds a lot of interaction and gives players much more to think about.  Although, ironically, I sometimes just enjoy the simplicity of Schotten Totten.

This game is clearly in the top couple of two player games that I've played.

Jun08: Hrmph.  I suppose I have to rate this.  It's still my favorite *game*, but the components are just crap.  The cards are paper thin and wouldn't last a week.  I've logged 30+ plays on my Schotten Totten deck and it still looks just fine.

As for the game though, still the best.  Tons of hand management and risk assessment.  Just the right mix of skill and luck.  Multiple victory conditions.  And a hint of deduction!  Just great.

I really like this game.  It reminds me of Lost Cities but much heavier.  It has a big advantage in that it can be played in at least three variants: (1) all rules and cards (the tactics cards add some randomness; whether I like that depends on my mood and my opponent's preferences), (2) remove the tactics cards (a bit deeper and less random game), (3) remove the tactics cards AND the 10 cards (same as Shotten-Totten).

Solid, quick two player game.    So far, we enjoy the game more by playing Schotten-Totten style without the tactics cards.  They seem to detract from the strategy and add a bit of extra luck.

Deeper than Lost Cities and without the wonky scoring, this one's likely to become a staple to pull out when there's enough down time. Only issue is that it would be significantly better if it took up less space, so I'm seriously considering printing a copy through ArtsCow on mini cards.

Excellent 2 player game. Excellent blend of strategy and luck. One of the best of Knizia's many good games. Win the majority of 9 flags (or 3 in a row) by playing sets of 3 cards per side before the other player does.

This is a game that reminds me of Lost Cities and how someone can take a basic (basic = crappy) game and change a couple of things and claim its a new game.  I don't hate the game.  I gave it a 6/10, but it's a game that I can only play a couple times before I find it extremely boring. **UPDATE** I played around 10 games with a friend of mine and I have to change my rating to 8/10.  It is actually alot better, you need to play a few games to start developing your own strategies and really finding an interest in the game.  Not a bad game afterall.

A great 2-player game that is almost a set collection and planning.  There are a couple of paths to victory, but it is a race to see who can claim it first.

Of note, on our first game I had a chance to win but forgot about one of my plays.  I put the card in another position instead of the winning one.  The second position was fine, but I ended up losing the game.  This is one sign of a good game.

One of my favorite two player games - just an excellent design.  While it may seem like there is a lot of luck and variance based on the cards you draw, there is a great deal of skill and calculation involved.  In my experience, playing against similarly skilled opponents almost always results in a tight game coming down to the last card or two.

Also, I have the Chinese edition with the metallic flags - much better components and artwork than the US version.

The popular view is that Battle Line is a better version of Lost Cities. I have to agree with that. I still like Lost Cities, but I really don't want to play it if I can play Battle Line. Improvements include: the game is very slightly faster, has direct player opposition instead of being two player solitaire, and it doesn't have the weird scoring system that confuses people when they play it the first time.
The one downside is that it doesn't look nearly as nice as Lost Cities. 

Still love Battle Line, but it's been pretty well replaced by East-West from Knizia's book Blazing Aces.

Began playing again, using the tactics cards a bit more, and moved it up to 10. The tactics cards change it enough that nothing else quite matches it.

As I have played a lot of Battleline (Schotten-Totten). I still love it but as I’m trying to maintain coherence within the BGG rating systems and my ratings, I’m downgrading the rating for the game to a 7.5. Still a good game I’m willing to play.

If I had to choose between Battleline and Schotten-Totten I would get Battleline (it has 1 more card and text on the tactics cads). However the games are similar enough for me that I don’t feel the need to buy this.

Most of my plays have been without the tactics cards, I think I will be playing with them next.

There's more skill here than it appears on first glance.  The key tactic seems to be how long to wait before pushing hard or bailing on a certain flag.

A fun game for 2 players. Feels like playing 9 hands of poker at the same time. I would use the Race Horse analogy to describe this game.

Quite AP-prone to some players.

In a genre that is notably lacking in quality (2 player Euro games), this one stands out as one of the best.  It has more replayability than any other 2 player euro I've tried with the exception of Ceasar and Cleopatra, which is a much longer game.

Knizia's version of Chinese Poker. Excellent design, where everything feels very tight with nothing that could be tweaked. Full of agonizing choices and planning ahead to counter potential threats, like my favorite abstracts. Reminds me of the traditional games of Piquet and Mate in that way too--but better.  Card counting and probability integral, of course.  I thought the tactic cards would ruin the game; but they blend in due to the clever limitations Knizia has imposed (e.g. you can't play two more than opponent has played, which adds another tactical move to the game). It's great that you can play the game without them depending on your mood.  I love how you can forestall a tactic card by claiming a flag early. Don't insult this game by calling it a "filler."

Being a Lost Cities addict, I figured my wife would take to this pretty quickly. She has never been a poker player and thus didn't quite understand the flush / straight business until halfway through our first game. I played it tonight with a friend and the game seems to be a more interesting version of lost cities. We have been playing with the tactics cards, so I'm interested to see how it places without. My wife hasn't written this game off yet, and admitted tonight that she will probably like it once she gets the hang of it.

This may well have taken over the top spot that Lost Cities previously held for me. A quick and fairly simple game, but full of difficult decisions and strategy. 

I'm a little iffy about the tactics cards (and don't usually use them) as they tend only to be useful as a preemptive strategy. By the time you can see where they're needed it's too late and your opponent has already claimed that battle.

Overall, it's a game I'm happy to play anytime.

Brilliant little 2 player trick taking game with a bit of theme on top that actually works.

Its basically making the best poker hand you can with the hand of cards you have by placing one card down at a time in turn, once you have three cards down that section is locked down and who ever has the best 3 card formation wins

For example you can have three cards of the same colour (Flush in poker) vs three of increasing value (Straight in poker)

Then you also get Tactics cards which can bend certain rules of the game.

RATING: 8
Thought provoking, yet easy to learn. Knizia hit the bullseye with this one. It's a (cosmetically) war-themed game that I can get my friends to play. The tactics cards make a good game (Schotten Totten) a lot better.

Play-Again Factor: High

RATING: 9
Easy to learn, replayable, and can fit in a couple games over lunch at work. Excellent!

The rule preventing one player from playing excess Tactics cards is a very smart touch, as this can be used to one's advantage (when you know the other guy wants to play one but isn't able to until you play one to "catch up").

RATING: 9.5
[>5 plays] Nine individual battles fought by placing mini poker hands by each flag. Win three-in-a-row or five total to win the game. It's important to leave yourself as flexible as possible for as long as possible because you won't get most of the cards you want. The tactics cards make for a variation to play; some are more powerful than others, so taking one may result in a useless card sitting in your hand. It's another one of my girlfriend's favorites.

Un juego divertido para dos personas. Las partidas son cortas y con ganas de revancha. Es una lucha por conseguir 5 banderas (ó 3 adyacentes) mediante la combinación más alta de 3 cartas a cada lado de cada bandera, siendo estas combinaciones tipo poker.

Además, puedes usar cartas tácticas que permiten romper formaciones ó usarlas como sustituto de cartas para completar una formación.

No es un juego nada complicado, pero las partidas tienen cierto punto de tensión.
[color=blue]
Funny game for two people. Games are short and with a little revenge flavour. You battle for getting 5 flags (or 3 adjacent flags) trying to combine 3 cards, winnig the highest one at both sides of each flag. These combinations are poker based.

Besides, you can use tactic cards that will allow you to break combinations or to use them for completing one.

It is an easy cardgame, but games are very competitive.

This is a good two handed Rummy game and I enjoyed playing it.  Like most Knizia games, the representational element is just window dressing.  I find this a little distracting.  If I'm playing a game based on ancient warfare, no matter how abstract the treatment, I like elephants to act like elephants, chariots to act like chariots, etc., not like a 9 of spades.

One of the most engaging 2-player games I own. Even though it's a 'war game' it's not a war game. Playable in 30 mins or less and carrying a somewhat universal poker ranking, its a fairly accessible game. Tactics and variations make this a fairly deep and thought-provoking game as you try to work out all the numbers and probabilities to your favor.

RATING: 8
A classic Knizia game of playing 3-card poker hands to either claim 5 of 9 flags or 3 consecutive flags. Tension of tension in this game.  When do I go hard for a flag versus when do I cut my losses.  When do I draft a tactics card?  When do I play my tactics card?   After one play, I can see this becoming a top 5 or 10 two-player filler game for me. Happy with the acquisition. Looking forward to more plays.  Wonder why I hadn't tried this sooner.

RATING: 9
Comparisons to Lost Cities made me steer clear of Battle Line for a long while. It's a much, much better game than Lost Cities, and yet, I understand the comparison. In both games, you have to pick your battles as you play cards to several points along a line. In each game, you try to make informed choices about how ambitious you can be with a particular batch of cards, how long you can delay before committing yourself further, etc. Battle Line just does all this with four times the depth of Lost Cities, and yes, a more apt theme. Sure, the gameplay is fairly abstract, but I can see outmaneuvering an opponent with superior formations a lot faster than I can see archeological expeditions. There are a lot of terrible couples games out there. This one is the real McCoy.

A beautifully simple design, and one that I'm growing to enjoy more and more with further plays. The first few times I tried it, I found myself uncharacteristically gripped with analysis paralysis. I'm not sure if I'm learning how to handle the game intuitively, or if I'm just slappin' cards down less strategically. Enjoyment is up, so I don't really care which it is.

This is the simple 2-player Knizia card game that should be recommended at every turn rather than the overproduced & overhyped Lost Cities.

The tactics cards don't make the game better, but they do give it a different feel which can be fun from time to time.

Lost Cities' more sophisticated cousin -- has that similar feel of having to commit to a plan without knowing whether it'll pan out.  Much more variety, though, than Lost Cities thanks to the tactics cards.

I really like the ebb and flow of this game.  You start out with high hopes, aiming for strong positions, and then start scrambling, trying to make the most of an always imperfect situation.  My Dad hated it -- I think he didn't feel he had enough control.

I love Knizia's ability to subtly evoke a real-life situation with fairly simple rules and abstract pieces.  I get great satisfaction when three lowly infantry are able to defeat three mighty elephants because the infantry have a stronger formation.

Classic press your luck game where most of your turns are tense decisions about where and when to commit to flags.  Many folks don't like the Tactics cards but I think they spice up what might otherwise be a drier affair.

RATING: 7.5
Number of players: 2

Components: (7)
I don't find the artwork to be particularly attractive, but the cards are good quality and easy to read and distinguish from one another.  
  
Rules: (10)
The rules are simple, clearly and logically written. 

Setup: (10)
You just have to play a number of “flag” pawns and make sure that they’re at least a card width away from each other.

Area required to play: (8)
This game doesn’t require a massive area to play, but more than you may expect. You’ll have nine columns, each will eventually hold approximately six cards (three to either side).
 
Fun: (7)
I enjoy this game. I understand why it’s been around as long as it has been, and expect that it’ll be around for much long.

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (7)
It works. This game could have just as easily be abstract. It could have also been about anything at all. It could have had a science fiction or fantasy theme! That would have been great.

Replay Value: (9)
Even though this isn’t my favorite game in the world, it’s one that I’m glad to have and one that I’m sure will be played many times throughout the years.

Storage: (8)
The box that this game comes in is about twice the size that it needs to be to house everything comfortably, but it’s still a small box and the insert does a nice job of keeping everything sorted and read for the next play.

Accessibility: (9)
The rules could be slightly confusing to some, but not daunting by any measure. If a person can play poker, a person can play this game.

This game is okay.  Schotten Totten is a much better game. I would rate Schotten Totten an eight. Battle Line is based on Schotten Totten.  The only difference between the two games is the extra ability cards and the number 10’s.  The extra cards and abilities in Battle Line just add an unwelcome randomness to the game.  You can play  Schotten Totten with the deck of Battle Line cards. I really enjoy Schotten Totten.  There is much more tactical play and not as much luck  I would buy Battle Line, this way if you like Battle Line you can play it or if you do not like it, you can still play Schotten Totten

A very nice strategy card game.  There is some luck to the draw of the cards but ultimately the strategy shines through with the decision how and when to play your cards which will ultimately determine how successful you are in winning flags.  The tactics cards are very few but they make the game infinitely more strategic and tense and really add to the joy of the game.  I agree that there is little theme to the game, the play would feel very similar if the deck had diamonds/spades/hearts/clubs on them but this does not hinder the enjoyment of a quick easy to learn but complex to play game.  

Update: dropped rating from 9 to 7.5 after 14th play.  Starting to think this game really just comes down to the luck of the draw.

While I'm not a huge fan of the 'luck of the draw,' this game is still a ton of fun and now ranks among my favorite 2 player games. Since you're building sets (of colors, straights, or both) and you need to allocate these sets to 9 possible battle positions it can be tough deciding how to 'deploy' your forces because the wrong deployment at the wrong time can tip your opponent off which way you're going for the win and that gives them an edge to counter (providing they have the cards needed). For the longest time I didn't see what all the talk was about, even after I bought it and read the rulesI didn't see it. It wasn't until I actually played it the first time that I realized *why* this ranks high for a lot of gamers, including myself now. I hope you may enjoy it as much as I do!

Schotten-Totten with ten-card suits, seven-card hands, and special cards that shake up the strategic probability management of the original gameplay with tactical surprises. I haven't played this enough to say whether the changes aside from the tactics cards are significantly better or worse, but I suspect they are unnecessary. I do know I don't care for the tactics cards which shove the balance between knowledge and uncertainty to a wacky place it really had no business going. You can of course use Schotten-Totten rules with these components and it would be my recommendation to do so most of the time. Also make sure you always play with the "advanced rule" of claiming at the beginning of your turn.

Wow! As everyone else has pointed out, yes, it's a lot of like Lost Cities, except with nine expeditions instead of five. That said, the choices are much tougher. My only complaints are that there's a little too much luck to the card draws, and I wished there was a more obvious logic to when you can claim a battle - you should be able to just point out that you have cards in your hand that make loss inevitable for your opponent. As it stands, you will sometimes lose because of your own good planning! I definitely want to own it, though.

Oh, the strategy! The agony of deciding what to do!
Once you know the game, try "Speed Battle Line", with enforced 5-second turns for a fun version that can help some people (like me) overcome AP!

Also, if you like Battle Line, try Magnate.

Played with my girlfriend, got trounced, loved it.  Game was actually pretty close as I suspect it will be most times, felt like I had a lot of option, and the pressure was always on to make a good move and try to figure my opponents intentions....reminded me a bit of lost cities, though I can't really say why...

A nice card game, should work with the females.
Not actually a wargame, more a simple card game.

A nice bit of back-and-forth over each line, coaxing your opponent into reacting enough for you to unambiguously prove your victory. Does a good job of adding wacky bonus cards without letting them overwhelm the game, by limiting them based on how many your opponent has already played - using them becomes a tense bit of brinkmanship.

Maybe my estimation of the game will get better over time, but so far it plays not much differently than many "traditional" games one could play with a standard deck of cards.  Hard to beat the price, though, and it is simple to explain to casual gamers who haven't played much else than cards and Monopoly.

I'd actually buy it again if they ever updated the art in an official version.  As-is its so awful as to put off most anyone from playing so I much prefer the new version of Schotten Totten instead which is now 90% the same game as Battle Line anyway.  I also prefer the battlelands you battle over in Schotten Totten vs. the simple pawns of Battle Line.  I've seen the terrain expansion for Battle Line and that is very interesting if it again ever made it's way into an official printing.

Update Jan 2017:  It looks like a designer sanctioned Medieval re-theme is in the works so if I can acquire that this may well return my rating to an 8+.  It includes the terrain expansion and the artwork is sublime.

REPLACED BY:  Schotten Totten.

Half the game is completely random with no semblance of a plan since you don't know what cards your are going to pull.  The end is quite interesting and fun, but it is not worth going through the motions to get there.

The cost is outrageous for what you get.  $20.00 for a deck of cheaply made cards and a few pegs.  Really should not have to pay more than $7.00 for this game IMHO.

CRITIQUE OF BATTLE LINE
I'm not a big fan of Knizia's games, because they are often sold with the promise of an interesting theme (setting off on an expedition in Lost Cities, fighting for control of Japan in Samurai) and yet the game itself is just a math exercise. The same could be said for Battle Line, because the detailed and interestingly named cards in the game have nothing to do with the gameplay.

Flexibility is the key to success in BL, but how you go about this is up to you. Playing one card next to a flag starts the formation, but keeps it flexible. Playing the second card locks you in to a particular formation. This makes you vulnerable to one of those "you can't win this one" losses. So keeping some formation open as long as possible can be a good strategy, but this can be offset by the fact that it forces you to lock in formations on other flags. And then there are the flags where you dump your bad cards, and you want to keep those open as long as possible.

The dynamics brought by the tactics cards are another interesting addition, and they dump even more choices onto your plate. Often I will never draw one, because this limits my opponent to a single draw from the pile. It's risky, but a draw from the regular deck can be just as valuable as a draw from the tactics deck. On the other hand, I've also played games in which the tactics pile was emptied fairly early on and every card came into play. Again, how you do this is up to you, and these cards add a nice twist to the game.

The thing that you have to remember is that even though the formations look like poker hands, in Battle Line the entire deck can be drawn into the players' hands. This means that you actually have a 50% chance of seeing any card. So it isn't that unlikely to hope that you will draw the card that completes a critical formation (even if it's the last ten in the deck). I love this aspect of the game, because there is tension with every card drawn. Fantastic.

As you can no doubt tell, I think this game gets most everything right. So why not rate it a 10? It's not a 10 because the tension actually decreases toward the end of the game, and the important thing about the game, the choices you make, ceases to be a factor at all. Every choice is important at the beginning, but as time goes on the luck of the draw starts to take over, and in the end luck will often decide the victor. Make no mistake; Battle Line is a good game, but this is what keeps it from being great.

This and Jaipur are the 2-player games my wife likes best so far. Battle line has a bit more tension, while Jaipur is more casual with a bigger luck element. So far several games have continued to the very last one or two open slots.

2016-01: Picked it up again after playing other games for a while. Still just as good. It felt dry the first moves of the first game, but then it got up to its usual pace. A fun mathematical, sort of bluffing, game.

RATING: 8
Full of agonizing choices- too often, no good play seems available, and you have to dump a card and hope it didn't just clinch the game for your opponent, but the person across the table has the same problem. The rule limiting use of the tactics cards raises the tension sometimes. As the game goes on, it seems both players are relying upon weaker and weaker melds- I think this is a key to the tension; you feel like your position gets weaker, but in reality, relative to your opponent, it doesn't. A fun mix of tactics and strategy, and I love the artwork. I was very pleased to see this come back in print months after a copy went on ebay for $60.

Very nice game with easy to learn/teach rules.  After only one play this has become a favorite of the wifes.  Only one complaint is not about the game play but about the components.  I really wish that GMT had used a heavier card stock for the cards. (17/6)

Strategical capture the flag with a poker hierarchy. Players take turns playing cards at various strategical places vying for a contested flag. The player with the best formation (read as poker hand) wins the flag. First to 5, or first to 3 adjacent flags wins. A lot of good strategy involved in this game. Some variance with card drawing, but otherwise plenty to think about with this one. Very fun 2 player game that can be played very quickly. Definitely willing to give this one many more plays.

Both versions include the tactic cards.

Seemingly a very simple game, but has lots of strategic depth and can be very tense at times. Very satisfying to win a close game against a good opponent.

Its art is as boring as you can get, but I feel like there's a terrific amount of strategy in the game. And yet, I feel like I'm terrible at the game and I'm not sure why.

My BGG.CON 2008 prize table game!  Not sure how I feel about it yet, but I was surprised at how surprised I was at how abstract it is.

Update: after a few more plays, this has really grown on me.

Update: this is now probably one of my favorite 2-player non-wargames.  I guess I could burn out on this after a while, but I can't believe how much I didn't like it the first time I played it.

2009-10-31: Moving this up to a 10.  The player who goes first seems to lose significantly more often, but that doesn't bother me much: it just makes a win that much more brutal when you went first, and a loss that much more painful when you went second.

Update: while cleaning up the game, I managed to pour a gallon of coffee into the box, ruining everything, including a really neat set of custom Tactics cards the burrito boy had made for me as a birthday present.  In my embarrassment I just picked up the whole thing & dumped it in the trash; later I wished I'd tried to save the cards the boy made for me, as they couldn't be replaced.  (I did later get a replacement copy--thanks leroy43!)

[b]"Basic" vs. "Advanced":[/b] I prefer the "basic" rule (claim flags at the end of your turn) over the optional "advanced" rule (claim flags at the start of your turn) because the game is meaner that way.  When you're in a position to claim a flag, "advanced" gives your opponent a chance to save their bacon if they happen to be holding an applicable Tactics card, or discard a card into the hopeless flag, making the game softer & more forgiving.  Pshhh!  (Poll [thread=410176]here[/thread])

Battleline is a clever "poker-like" cardgame, which is fun to play every now and then. It's not a super hit or unique game at all, but a good filler IF you like poker.

RATING: N/A
Two opponents face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags. Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.

I wanted to try this one using the Schotten-Totten rules for a long time but it really worked fine with the tactic cards so I had't felt the need to give the other one a try. Then once I tried ST and realised that's a little bit even better.

RATING: N/A
Totally fascinating on so many levels. But I can see how the game might be even better with the original rules from Schotten-Totten (no '10' cards, hand limit of 6, no Tactics cards, flags can only be claimed at the beginning of your turn). The changes made in Battle Line were implemented as a marketing strategy intended to make the game more appealing to an American audience. Not that I'm complaining: the Tactics cards are really fun and well-designed. But the "pure" game without them is most likely tighter strategy-wise, and perhaps more subtle.

De los mejores juegos rápidos a 2 que he probado. Típico de Knizia, hay que hacer combinaciones de colores y números para ganar "batallas" y conseguir puntos para ganar la partida. Muy interesante, a veces muy estratégico y con tensión. Super recomendable.

I love this 2 player game. One of my favorite 2 player games. I really enjoy the strategy at the beginning of the game. I have ran into an issue towards the end of the game where you basically know you will lose due to what's already been laid out and what cards are left in the deck. Besides that, I always enjoy playing this game. Such a simple game, but lots of strategy to it.

Two player game very similar to "Ceasar & Cleopatra".  It's a step up from Lost Cities: much more competitive and hardcore.  Rules are simple, gameplay very abstract and mathy.  The "proof" part is a bit tedious making it a bit nerdier than C&C.

excellent 2-plyr Schotten-totten with specially added tactic cards.  some don't like the tactics cards added but I think it adds more strategy and flavor (remember, you could only use 1 more tactics cards than your opponent uses, if s/he uses any at all).  since the randomness comes from one deck, I like having another deck to potentially compensate (re-balance randomness with another deck so to speak).  the advanced rules usually increase the likelihood of (more) tactics cards used.

Very intense strategy game.  Despite the fact that it plays quickly and is only a deck of cards with a few pawns, this game presents you with more tense decisions and tricky puzzles than many larger and more complicated games.

RATING: 8
Card game was not regarded as a serious enough game by gamers back then.  Things now change as the popularity of the use of cards grew.  Also, it appears that it has a sound and working system...unlike other card play problems in other card games, e.g. one of the very own is designer's Ivanhoe.  This game is actually a poker in disguise, but with slight twists of course.  The normal suit orders follow (they are given the formation names in the game for the theme though) and if they are tied in suits, the higher total no. claims the flags.  You win by claiming any 5 flags out of a total 9 or 3 ones if they are adjacent to each other.  Some tactics cards change opponent's deployment so you might see one flank suddenly collapses. A good time-filler in a club day.

Note: The game is so good that I bought the iPhone app.  Since then, numerous and countless gameplays.  I have lost count of the number of the games played as I play it often to fill the time during travel, in the washroom, or at nights before sleep.....yes, I don't feel getting any tired of it. The count of the gameplay here in BGG refers to the original version by GMT and face to face plays.

This is a step up from Lost Cities.  My husband does not like the bonus cards (I don't remember what they're actually called) that you can use to screw your opponent or give yourself a big boost.  As it's a choice to take those cards, which means you won't do something else that could benefit you, I'm ok with them.  This is fun little game that can be used as filler on a game night while games are wrapping up or played by a couple after a long day at work.  The game moves along quickly and plays in a short amount of time.

RATING: 8
Great, mathy Knizia (a bit of an oxymoron) where deducing the best course of action relative to cards in play provides limited information early on thus forcing one to commit to actions based on the likelihood of drawing further cards in support of one's position which is a calculated risk at best.

RATING: 9
Perhaps my favorite 2P game - the fact that it has so much in common with a mainstream game (Poker) makes the learning curve substantially easier. The tactics cards certainly shake things up somewhat, but there's still nothing like seeing the opponent realize that the game is not only about making poker hands, but about MAINTAINING open options to place cards - that is the key to the game. Whomever has to start 'destroying' hands first, losing options, typically loses the game.

RATING: 9
Una estrategia inicial puede consistir en no enseñar demasiado pronto al rival qué combinación es la que vas a poner tras una bandera; así, el rival no sabrá a qué hacer frente y de esta manera tú podrás reaccionar de una u otra manera según la carta que el rival jugó.

Otra opción consiste en no poner cartas delante de una posible muy buena combinación del rival de manera que éste tenga la victoria segura en esa bandera. Es mejor colocar cartas en banderas vacías tanto por el rival como por ti.

Tampoco es bueno tener en tu mano demasiadas cartas tácticas, ya que es posible que no puedas utilizarlas todavía y además te impiden tener más cartas de tropa que quizá te serían de utilidad en la partida. Esta opción sólo es viable si pretendes evitar que el jugador rival tenga tal o cual carta de táctica.
Por lo general, 1 ó 2 cartas de táctica en tu mano de juego es lo más óptimo. 

Saber qué cartas de táctica están por salir puede ser muy útil para afrontar una estrategia u otra.

RATING: 7.5
A beautiful example of how you can build a classic game with a very simple rule set.  What you’re doing in Battle Line is essentially no more than playing 9 simultaneous hands of poker; the hand management mechanic is no more than building the best combination of three cards.  But the way you have to build them based on your opponent’s actual and predicted moves, combined with a solid theme and an element of card counting, makes it suspenseful as hell.

The theme is well-executed, with simple but handsome art, and while it’s not especially deep, it does remind you of the strategic elements of warfare.  The Tactics cards throw in a bit of wildness, as well, to keep things interesting.  Takes up a bit of space, but otherwise a perfect portable 2-player game.

RATING: 9
I don't see this replacing [GAMEID=50] completely, and especially not as an "airport game".  [GAMEID=760] feels different from other light card games such as [GAMEID=50], [GAMEID=6137], and two player [GAMEID=11].  Those games are more light and more about risk management, while [GAMEID=760] feels a lot more tactical and analytical.  It can be easy to fall into analysis paralysis here.  It's much more about weighing the probabilities and trying to better the position your cards against your opponent.  As a result, it can sometimes feel reactive as the best move is often to simply wait and see what your opponent plays.  It also misses the control of draw deck tempo and the delicious tension of possibly discarding and giving your opponent valuable cards in [GAMEID=50].  Surprisingly, I would say that [GAMEID=50] can often feel like you're more in control because you do have that control over temp and how much of the deck you actually see.  In [GAMEID=760], what cards you see are pre-determined from the start and your goal is just to make the best of it.  I'm not trying to bag on [GAMEID=760]---we actually really do enjoy it, and it really does have a feel of directly facing off against your opponent in a battle line.  Although just a card game, it adds in a spatial component over where you should play your cards.  Two different, good games that have a place in our library.  One is to take with us as a low-stress game in airports, the other is for an evening of brain burning.

As for the Tactics card debate...surprisingly, we're strongly on the side of the original Schotten Totten rules with no Tactics cards and 1-9 card values.  It seems like usually we prefer games having a lot of different actions to choose from, but there's something very clean and strategic about the original rules that works for us.

RATING: 5
This game definitely has a very high level of tactical play, even if one does not consider it does so in a very short time, and with rules that can be basically taught to anyone. However, when I thin of the fun value, it doesn't hold up as strongly. It is extremely abstract; there is very little hiding that you are basically just playing cards of different suits and numbers (albeit with a couple of special cards). To me at least it lacks tension because there is no real tug of war for each individual part of the "battle line", instead, as you play cards you reveal what you can't do, and your opponent either has a chance to beat it or they don't. Therefore, it never feels like "oh god, I need to concentrate here to save this part of the battle line", even if you actually do tactically by saving cards to ensure better sets in that area. Finally, despite its simplicity there is actually a decent amount of overhead because to play optimally, you need to see what are your possible combinations based on every single card on the table.

Played once.

Ken:
Quick, compact 2-player game with significant replayability and depth.  Sold off because it felt a bit too abstract, and had been "played out" through being preceded by the inferior, but heavily played and similar Lost Cities.  We were also getting into the 2 player FFG LCGs at this point, and preferred their more thematic feel.

Would be willing to play again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Kathleen:
Game could be very one-sided, very quickly.  Pointless theme-ing that added un-needed complexity.

RATING: 10
This game shares alot of qualities with Lost Cities and if you like one you'll probably like the other, but for my money Battle Line is the better game.  Lost Cities is tighter and quicker with better game production, but Battle Line seems like it has a little more meat on its bones.  The nine flags give you a little more room for recovery and the tactic cards are surprisingly unbroken and add an interesting twist.  Like Lost Cities I really like the ratio of known    to unknown information and how it changes the more you get into the game.       Towards the end of the game when it becomes more and more obvious what you can or can't do as cards are laid down tension really begins to build and the game mechanics shine.  This isn't my favorite game to play, but until I play a better two player game this gets a 10.  I feel like Lord of the Ring: Confrontation might knock it down, but until then...

A great 2-player game.  Will play whenever I have the chance.  

UPDATE:  I realized that I had been playing this all wrong.  Now that I know the correct way of playing this game remains a very well done 2-player card game.  The tactics cards adds a little unpredictability to the game which I like.

A friend of mine picked this up, and we spent a couple of hours playing it.  I found it fun and quite likable.   I don't think I'd plunk down full price for a new copy, but I might be willing to buy Battle Line used for a good price.  

The theme does make me laugh.  The gameplay is all about pattern matching, yet it has this pasted-on veneer of ancient warfare.  They could have used pretty much any theme they wanted: spaceships capturing starbases, WW2 infantry capturing hilltops, good guys fighting zombies, vampires vs. werewolves, etc.  LOL....

Everybody plays to win in Battle Line.  No matter how amiable a game may start, it always ends with desperation and exaltation.   I love it.  My wife and I will play game after game after game, smiling, sweating, and swearing over our cards.  There is nothing sweeter than explaining to your opponent why it's no longer possible for them to win a flag, watching their face as you slide it over to your side.

RATING: 9
Very interesting game that balances skill and luck at the same time. Of course extreme amounts of luck can win you a game (five 8-9-10 "royal flushes"), but most of the time, the key to victory is to squash your opponent's formation with a slightly better one on your side. Careful use of tactics cards will reverse the tide of the game, which is crucial when you're getting "cannon fodder" cards from the draw pile.

Best played with an experienced player, as the game will be highly vicious (and fun!).

Played without the tactics card.  So, I guess I should be rating schotten-totten instead.  Had so much fun.  Played about 7 games on the first day!!  Lots of computing of probabilities.  Quite a bit better (deeper) than Lost Cities.  I'm hooked!

RATING: 9
Simple, enjoyable, yet deep. An excellent 2 player game that plays within 30'.

Each player manages a total of 9 formations along a battle line. Each of your formation fights against the formation on the opposite side of the battle line. The outcome of the battle depends on the type of the opposing formations: the strongest formation type wins. Much like poker :-)

The types of formations are indeed very similar to poker hands (straight flush, 3 of a kind, flush etc). In Battle Line each formation has 3 cards from a deck of 6 colors and you manage 9 hands concurrently.

Currently our favorite game. We just love the balance between luck and strategy. The middle game, where you need to choose a initial strategy against each of the 9 emerging hands is great fun with an element of tension thrown in. We love the way the special cards can be kept in check by simply not playing them. The game is also very fast paced, allowing it to be played almost any time and encouraging the play of multiple rounds.

Received in trade.  And this was a wildly successful trade on my end.  This is played with decent frequency.  It's like a poker variant, with some power cards that allow the rules to be bent.  However, these power cards can only be played if the other player has had a chance to play one after you have played one.  Quick and fun.

RATING: 9
Classic game! 

Battle line is all about excruciating decisions (in a fun way.) Where to commit and where to yield when you can no longer keep your options open. Such a tight design and the tactics cards add just the right amount of rule-bending spice and an additional tactical layer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wonderful game. Players usually try to keep several cards in hand to surprise the adversary later in the game, but soon start to run out of options. A good balance between luck and strategy. I am not fond of 2-player-only games, but this ranks among the best!

I REALLY like this little two player game.  It seems any time that GMT makes a non-standard, non-chit-based game, it's fantastic (Dominant Species/Thunder Alley).  Battle Line is no exception to the rule.  At first I played without the tactics cards, but I've started enjoying using them as well.  This game is simple to learn, hard to master, and both rewarding and frustrating as you try to draw to the cards that complete your formations.

This is a simple game, but it has A LOT of depth.

At first, I thought "Ok: set collection and hand management. Let's do this". But, as the game progressed, I was like: "WOW, there's a lot going on here! I have to think this through as there are so many possible tactics to be applied".

On the downside, it's abstract. You don't feel yourself as a general trying to break through a battle line as the name and the cards try to suggest, but as a person trying to make sets of cards and place them in a better way than your enemy.

Overall, this is a very good 2-player game. It's much heavier than it suggests, and it's abstract.

Battle Line fits in a weird spot for me. While Knizia's Lost Cities is simple enough to be played passively as a filler when engaging your attention in some other activity (converstation, watching television, etc.), Battle Line is slightly more complex and requires a higher level of attention to detail. The downside of this is that I do not find the gameplay in Battle Line interesting enough to warrant focusing all of my energy toward playing it as I would another head-to-head card game or abstract strategy.

This game gets compared to Lost Cities a lot and I can see the reason.  Both are quick 2-player easy-to-learn type games.  This one has more strategy and tactical choices, but a little more of a learning curve and is more confrontational. 

Graphically, it is very ugly and could badly use a reprint with better art.

This has everything I want from a Knizia game: short play time, incredible depth:size ratio, tough decisions every turn, evil math, and a surprising amount of strategy for what it is. I love it.

The two win conditions plus the need to weigh holding a card so as not to tip your hand on a flag vs. committing a card somewhere useful vs. keeping a number as a number instead of using it for color vs. so many other little things make this a really neat game.

Following BGG advice, I left my tactics cards in shrink; I have no intention of ever using them. Why mess with a game this good?

I need to play this more to get a better handle on it, but I think it really depends on your opponent for it to be interesting.

OK, this is the game that finally convinced me that theme can be as important as the mechanic. Pretty much the same game as Schotten-Totten (new version that has tactics cards as well), but this is much more enjoyable. The only difference is theme. This one works well. Scotten-Totten's is not as successful.  Too bad the card stock is mediocre.

RATING: 6
Definitely can feel the Lost Cities vibe in this one. I do like the bluffing and waiting out the opponent aspect in this one, but felt it wasn't as tight and stressful as Lost Cities. i do like that it's less math heavy, and more balanced across the board. Unlike in lost cities, where one great stack of handshake agreements can win you the game. Battle Line is a nice game in its own right, but i'll probably have to give the nod to Lost Cities for good artwork and large easily shuffled cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
5 / 5 - Great

I was surprised by how much I liked this. It has overtones of Lost Cities but is much, much more interesting to play. You've got tough choices to make about whether to use your cards in difficult to fill but tough high-value formations or easier low-value formations. There's also a placement and timing element which is fascinating - when and where do you start to commit your formations of varying power? Quite possibly the best short game I've ever played.

This game has grown on me.  At first I thought it was just a simple game with a poker mechanic.  Yes, there is some luck of the draw involved, but the game gets very fun and tense as the players are getting down to their final few placements and must decide where to drop their cards.  My opinion, the best strategy is to draw all the Tactics cards first.

My review: http://manualgamer.com/battle-line-review/

March 2013:  Increased rating to 9.5:  Love this game, it is my favourite to play with my wife.  Plays quickly, simple enough rules, tense action when trying to counter the opponent's strategies (ad not overcommit oneself, which can lead to counter attacks), never outstays its welcome.  Perfect filler.  Simple, elegant, quick, and fun.

December 2012:  Rating of 9: Excellent game.  Very easy to teach, clean and simple mechanics. Quick to play, great for couples and a modern classic.

Like the theme too.  While not crucial to the game play, it certainly is a great fit. 

A must buy, even though I already have a 2 person light strategy game (Hive Pocket), and a point domination game (Blood Bowl:TM).  It is less complex than either, and great for playing with those who don't like complex rules.

RATING: 8
Solid two-player card game that involves playing a series of three-card "poker" hands.  Each three-card hand represents a battle.  To win, you must beat your opponent in five of nine battles or in three consecutive adjacent battles.

One of the interesting aspects of this game is that you may use deduction to prove that one of your completed hands cannot be beaten by your opponent.  If you can prove such, you may claim victory in the battle immediately.  This is important to do because of the existence of tactics cards.

Tactics cards are played in the same fashion as regular cards, with the limitation that you may only play one such card more than your opponent.  Some tactics cards are wild cards, some allow you to move/swap/shift cards, while others change the requirements for a particular battle.  For example, one of the cards makes it so that you must play four cards rather than three.  Hence, if you fail to properly claim victory in a battle and your opponent plays this card, you may no longer claim victory.

Definitely the best of my Knizias. That's it. (See Knizia comments elsewhere - and I'm quite fond of abstracts). I'm afraid the Herr Doktor doesn't really light my fire, but this is a cracking and tense little game where you try to outguess your opponent's thinking. What you don't play is almost as important as what you do - you don't want to play cards too early and give a clue as to what you're up to. Very simple and devilishly tense. A very, very good game.

2-Player filler'ish card game. A tense tug of war with bluffing and hand managment. Push and pull, then throw it out of whack with the tactics cards. A very clever system that takes a bit more to "get" I think than some are willing to invest in such a short game (with the whole "prove that you win" mechanic) but ye, fun. You can really agonize over which card to play (wishing you could pass even), clear parallels to Arboretum which I tried before this.

Tremendous 2-player game.  I had my doubts looking at the art style and components, but this is a brilliant card game.  Lots of cool nuances than appear after repeated plays.  I'd suggest playing without the Tactics cards at first to get a handle on the "basic" game.  Extremely easy to learn and get going quickly (especially if you are familiar with Poker rules.)  This has quickly become a fav with the work crew, but it's a 2-player only game.

Fun and easy 2 player card game. Battle theme is well served  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Compete individually for each of nine lined-up flags by playing three cards at each one. The best three cards wins the given flag. Take five of the nine flags or three in a row to win.

Played as: Two-player only, with Tactic cards as well as without.

Pros: Knizia has a way of making 'discard and draw' games so interesting-- T&E, Lost Cities, even Ingenious, and now this. Always so simple, but never an easy choice among many possibilities on any given turn. It can be played a little more friendly by leaving out the tactic cards, but I feel with Tactic cards using the advanced rules is where this game shines its most. That way there's still tension even when you have the card you need because it gives your opponent the chance to counter. There's no knowing what they'll have and it really cuts down those inevitable 'I've got this in the bag' moments.

Cons: I kinda felt ripped off when I opened the box and saw how little I got for my money (nine markers, and a couple decks of cards). The luck to time-of-play ratio might be a hair high on the luck tolerance scale (this can vary depending on players, see: AP prone), though I wouldn't call this a completely luck dominated game. Can make for some sour losses (for a lighter game like this) when a tactic card crashes your party.

Other: Less luck-based then Lost Cities and maybe not the perfect replacement I originally thought. Has more direct screwage with potential to offend the more light-hearted Lost Cities players. The flip-side is the screwage is a big plus for everyone else. I've been getting a lot more play of this with a home-built version I scrapped together on the road sans Tactic cards but would probably rate the game a 6 or so under that format. I have it rated where it is assuming tactic cards and using the advanced rules.

Best Use: A quick and easy game that works nicely with new players at home or on the road.

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/419542/big-bulleted-battle-blueprint-please-add-your-own]My Battle Line Strategy Article[/url]

After 9 plays. Battle Line is often compared to Lost Cities.  To my mind, Battle Line is a way better game.  There are several reasons.  First is the win condition.  Lost Cities' win condition forces a player to constantly evaluate a stupid algebraic expression in her head throughout the game just to get a read on where she stands in relation to her opponent.  And then, when the game is over, it's not immediately obvious who won, but you to do more algebra to find out.  It's clunky and it pushes players away from the "flow" state.  Battle Line has a very simple, visual win condition, that avoids the clunk. It also has a much greater bluffing element than Lost Cities, which this bluffaholic loves. A final difference is that, whereas in Lost Cities, you can discard on your turn and thus avoid having to play a card that will hurt you, Battle Line offers no such option.  This is a key to the insane tension that a game of Battle Line creates.

What Battle Line shares with Lost Cities is the fact that you have to commit to certain courses of action before you know whether you'll be able to get to the resources to make those commitments worthwhile.  This is another good source of tension. From a more meta-game perspective, intuition can triumph regularly in both games.  The above notwithstanding, with experience, the *feel* of play is totally different between the two games.

[EDIT]  After 18 plays, this is moving up from my original 7 rating. This has replaced LOTR:C as my favorite non-abstract game.  I spent a whole day at work trying to get this game out of my head.  This is the first time in a very long time that a game has grabbed me like this.  Mind-boggling number of factors to consider during a game.  The more I play this, the more it resembles nothing else.  the fact that a small card game with dinky components can make it right up to near the top of the rankings on a website full of component-whores suggest others feel the same way.

[EDIT]  After 35 plays, my 9 rating holds steady, but the way that I see the game continues to change.  At the moment I'm going through a period of confusion.  Despite many games and much thinking, I still feel I'm missing some fundamental insight.  It's extremely difficult to play or think about analytically, because all the probabilities that one cares about in the game are completely tangled up with one another.  Battle Line is a wall of inscrutability, but it remains maniacally fun.  And it's just a deck of cards!  It's sort of like the "Go" of card games.

[EDIT] I'm somewhere north of 200 plays now but I've lost count. This game is officially in my Pantheon of greats. An endless, sublime challenge.  A lifetime game. I've played it tons both with and without the tactics cards, and I've come to prefer it without. Two reasons: first, the tactics cards increase the randomness of the game and in doing so destroy some of the most interesting aspects of planning and resource management. There's more room for clever, skilled play without the tactics cards. Second, the tactics cards make straight flushes more important and the other kinds of formations less important, which reduces variety in play. For example, yesterday I won a game without getting a single straight flush; that could never happen if I were playing with tactics cards.

It's exceptionally hard to make truly great "small" games. Battle Line is small in every way except for the experience of playing it. For that reason it's impressed me as much as any Knizia game has (and many have)

"Schotten Totten ( Battle Line) is so very wonderful. The new Iello version is spectacular and definitive. Everything from the previous versions with the classic scenario returned and packaged for the first time in great art.

Fight for dominance on each area by playing a card in one of the areas and pulling a new card for your next turn. Reach player can only place up to three cards in each area. And the winner is determined by the poker hands you create with just those three cards.

Just a delight. I like it a lot more than Lost Cities, although the Lost Cities art is wonderful. Schotten had more depth."

The theme is lighter than air, and there is nothing special about the mechanics. But it's fast and simple and does what it sets out to do.

I'd play it every once in a while as a between games quickie, but that's it. I doubt that I would ever ask to play. It's one of the better lightly themed, set- or hand-building card games with a simple twist that I've played. But that's not saying much in my estimation, because this type of game just isn't important in my gaming life. Unless I've got absolutely nothing better to do, I'd rather just sit and talk to someone for 10 minutes while waiting for a game.

This one is my favorite by Knizia. In the first two months of owning it, I played 10
                                                   times. In the second 2 months, another 10. Since then, it&#039;s tapered off some, but it still
                                                   comes out on a regular basis. I&#039;m sure it will hit 30 times by the end of the year (2002).
                                                   This game has some of the same feel as Lost Cities, but with more depth and options.
                                                   The tactics cards (and number 10 cards) are all that&#039;s been added over the original

Another one of these Knizia games that occasionally feels like homework. That is, you want to put it off, but sometimes you can't. I definitely prefer this to Lost Cities, although that is in some part because I have played Lost Cities far too much. The tactics cards give you a nice way to manage risk, as the handshakes do in L.C. Maybe better. It's well-done, and a good alternative, but these games are not my preferred way to waste half an hour.

It's like Lost Cities...without the shared cards...with a dash of Caesar & Cleopatra.

Bought this and C&C on Jan 2, 2006.  I'm hoping to make 2006 the year of the game for me and my wife.  We'll see.  First played on March 17, 2006.  Initial thoughts:  - A very well structured game.  - The rules make considerably more sense once you play the game a couple of times, especially the flag capture using the cards played on the board as evidence.  - It has a similar structure to Lost Cities (another Reiner Knizia game) but it has the potential to be more aggressive and, in turn, has a more attractive game play for me.

RATING: 8
Play cards in combinations that are superior to your opponent's.

Plays: More than 100?
Type: Area control game = a game where you compete for control of areas.
Complexity: Light strategy game.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 15 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources - pawns.
Randomness: Low.

Replayability: Very high. This is one those rare "simple yet deep" games. Only takes 15 mins to play and is portable. Most of my plays have been done in cafés or pubs. Often you play best of three or best of five.
Fun: The fun lies in the decision making of hand and board management.
Memorability: Not really.

Thematic integration: Weak.
Components: Functional.

Who will like this: This is probably the best quick strategy game for 2. Cheap, quick, portable - a must have in every game collection.

RATING: 7
Knizia-féle agyalós kártyajáték, kifejezetten két játékosra. Nem elég a kártyaformációkat ismerni, folyamatosan figyelni kell a másikra is. Ez az a játék, amit szerintem 20-30 játszma után lehet csak reálisan értékelni (ahhoz meg még keveset játszottunk vele).

Nem rossz, nem rossz, de túl száraz így néhány parti után. Ráadásul szerintem meg csak akkor élvezhető igazán, ha mindkét játékos találkozott már pókerrel is közelebbről (és nem csak a kártyaformációkra gondolok, blöff-faktor is bejátszhat olykor: "ide akarok egy sort, ja, mégsem, oda fog menni a következő kártya és elviszem a zászlót előled").

Első néhány játék után egyelőre nem győzött meg, jónak jó, de nem az a "mindenképpen kell" kategória.

UPDATE (2016.09.25.): Beszerzésre került az Imperial BL (Kártyagyár kiadás), aminek már a kinézete is sokat dob a játék élvezhetőségén. Ezért fel is pontoztam (meg persze mert egyre inkább tetszik).

RATING: 7
Interesting game...Feels like playing Lost Cities, Poker, and crunching out a logic puzzle all at the same time.  The simple rules make it seem like a walk in the park...but trust me, Battle Line is much more challenging than it appears at first glance.  Game play is centered around players, in turn, adding to a group of cards which "faces off" against an opponent's group in various "battles".  Based on various orders of color, numbers, and numerical straights, each combination lies somewhere on the hierarchy of worth.  Highest group takes that particular battle...if they can prove it!

Very challenging Knizia game - I really like the Poker ranking system.  It also has tough forced play decisions that are very reminiscent of Lost Cities.  The victory conditions (win five or three adjacent) gives an already very strategic game another layer to consider.  AP is a definite possibility - especially mid game but the playable options narrow enough to force progress in the late game.  Really good design, and I think I like it better than Lost Cities.

This is one of my wife's favorite 2 player games and neither of will ever turn down a game.

I seldom get to play 2 player games but Battle Line is portable and so elegant that I couldn't resist it. Take turns to play cards to one of nine flags and claim a flag by having a better card combination than your opponent. The first turns are deceptivingly calm but eventually you have to decide whether to complete an OK combination or wait for a better card that may never come. A true "just one more time" game.

Enjoy this game very much, although we tend to play it as Schotten-Totten (cards only up to number 9, 6 cards each).  We have played with the tactics cards and, in fact, view it as two different games.  S-T is taughter and more tense, while Battle Line proper opens up the possibilities and allows for a greater fluidity of play.

Its depth and portability (although you need a little space to play) make it something I am always happy to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like Lost Cities, but with more flags, so there's more room to set up a strategy over several turns.  In Lost Cities you often have to go charging into a suit and hope it works out, whereas here you can spread out a bit more and take your time.  Also, the tactics cards provide nifty ways out of a pinch.  They introduce a luck factor depending on which tactics you draw, but they cancel out luck at the same time by letting you substitute for cards you didn't draw, or that you played too early elsewhere.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Battle Line holds up well as a semi-mindless activity. As an interesting game, however, it's not nearly enough for me to understand the general enthusiasm towards it. First and foremost the early game is really chaotic, in the sense that a reasonable level of probabilistic reasoning can't be driven from the opening hand (or even the first 15 plays). Such an incertitude is unfortunately only toned down as turns pass and you're mostly spending the game formulating hopeful wishes, sometimes holding information about your opponent's chances on a given line without being able to do anything clever with it. As far as I went, three-of-a-kind and royal flushes are all there is, because you have little incentive to dump unwanted cards on a line and allow lower combinations to be useful to your opponent.

As a general matter of fact, you always feel at the mercy of the draw and are longing for some interesting decisions. Perhaps I'd start to see their existence after a dozen games of utter boredom, but unless I'm shown a convincingly documented sample of the ingenious intricacies of high level play, this doesn't look like a gambit worth taking. On the bright side, since everybody seems to agree that Battle Line is leagues above Lost Cities, I don't have to consider checking that one out anymore.

Perhaps the most tactical game of "capture the flag" I ever played... I quite enjoyed it! A typical Knizia game for 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Classic Knizia in that this is more like a mathematical puzzle than a game.  I like the analogy of Bach to Knizia (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/150870/knizia-bach), and Battle Line certainly holds true of this analogy.

You've essentially got 6 suits of 10 numbers each.  You've got a hand of 7 cards, and 9 positions (flags) to which you can play cards.  At each position you are trying to create a "straight flush," 3-of-a-kind, all of one color, etc.  Your opponent is trying to do the same.  First person to win three contiguous positions or five total positions claims victory.

First off, you can tell that a mathematician designed this game, and it carries all of Knizia's traits of colors and numbers weakly themed to a particular narrative.  When it works, you've got great games with depth and longevity, like Ra and Lost Cities.  When it doesn't, you've got Lord of the Rings, Kingdoms, Poison, etc.  Not bad games, mind you, just games where the mathematical exercise gets a little tiresome relative to the theme.  

Battle Line is one of Knizia's games that works.  Again, it's really only a card game, and if you've never cared for card games, I don't see how you'd like this game.  However, the balance of the game is sooo tight.  It's HARD to definitively capture a flag, and practically every turn feels like a difficult choice.  Let's say you've played three "4"s to a location, and your opponent has played a "2." You haven't won the position until you can prove that they can't get the 1 and 3 of the same color as the "2," (any straight flush trumps three-of-a kind).  If you happen to have the 1 or 3 in your hand, maybe you'll want to play it in order to satisfy this "proof."  But you can't just put it anywhere, because that might enable your opponent to capture *that* particular position.  

In addition the game includes a small number of "tactics" cards.  After playing a card, a player can either draw from the "strategy" deck (number/suits) or the "tactics" deck.  The latter basically introduce modifiers / actions.  So for example, play the "traitor" card and you can take one card from your opponents side and move it to your side. Play the "mud" card and a position will be decided by four cards instead of the normal three. There are not too many of these cards, which I appreciate, and their effects are narrowly focused.  Also, given that the strategy cards (number/suits) are what win the game, deciding to forgo a draw of such a card for a tactics card can be a bit risky, which again, gets at the superb balance of this game.

Highly recommend.  Can be played at a bar.  Very simply rules that produce a sense of difficult choices and some puzzle-like deduction. Absolutely won't last more than an hour.

Hmm, this was okay I suppose. I do wish there was a bit more to mitigate the draw of cards and the gameplay itself was okay, typical play a card back and forth. For poker hands though, I do think I'd probably prefer Hocus.

A good 2-player game, somewhat similar to Gin/Rummy type games, with some bluffing thrown in. You try to get, essentially, 3 card straights or flushes to outrank your opponent for each one of nine "flags." You need 5 of the flags or 3 adjacent to win. 

This was a interesting game. I'm not ready to rank it after 1 play but certainly would like to play again.

Ah - there's the sweet spot!  More complex than Lost Cities (which I love despite its relative simplicity) and simpler than Scarab Lords (which I love despite its relative complexity).

My one play of this was so long ago that I don't remember much.

For a game composed of very basic components with easy to learn rules, Battle Line involves some serious strategy. Decisions are essentially based on one's ability to card count, or lack thereof.

I'm glad that they changed the name to Battle Line when the game was reimplemented, because Schotten-Totten is a stupid sounding name. I can persuade people to play BL, but Schotten-Totten would have been a really tough sell.

The worst part of BL is the cards. They are so stiff that they make shuffling actually painful.

My respect for this game continues to grow over time.  Much like the Caribbean 3-Card Poker from which it gets its main mechanic, this game is about psychology, making the most with what you're given, and persuading your opponent that a given race is already lost.

This joins Hocus as games that I bring for people who don't like board games but who love Poker.

2017 UPDATE: I'm not willing to say Hanamikoji has replaced Battle Line/Schotten Totten... but in the past year I haven't opened my copy of Battle Line, and I've played tons of Hanamikoji.  Might be time to gift it.

Jury is still out on this one.  Battle poker!  This game, so far, gives me the greatest sense of "if I just had one more card at which to look...".  To me, the name matches the game.  Each game I have played has been a struggle, mostly down to the wire.  The downside for me is that I feel like every game is evenly matched, each side gaining momentum only to lose it a few turns later.  Every game has seemed to come down to the luck of the final draw.  I cannot say that my play really made any difference.

Having played this again with a younger opponent, I definitely saw the difference in strategy.  I think my earlier foes were more evenly matched.

Why this is not a 10:
-> The last play is luck factor rubs me the wrong way
-> There are many other games out there that I would rather play...
-> Hence I would not suggest this over others I have
+ but I would gladly accept a challenge from anyone

A tense and confrontational game which I like a lot. It's a classic Knizia - low on theme but high on agonizing decisions and with a simple and elegant ruleset.

It really gets tense in the later stages when you are desperately trying to find something that doesn't lose you the game!

It seems like it would work better when you have a regular opponent of equal skill, though I unfortunately lack one (this is not however due to my having superior skill).

I tried the "flag clam at beginning of turn" variant, and it introduces even more tension. Argh!

A brilliant 2-player card game.  Although the theme is tacked on, ancient battles, especially Alexander the Great vs the Persians, is a theme I love.  I can quite easily imagine the flags representing the parts of the line of an ancient battle and as a general committing my forces at certain points to either hold or attempt a breakthrough.  There are some agonising decisions to be made when laying cards down.  An added bonus are the tactics cards which allow you to play a more advanced version of the game.

I am not sure what the strategy is at the beginning of the game before the battle begins to take shape--you don't want to form even a strong set because tactics cards or a superior set can ruin your plans.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]This has become one of my favorite 2p card games, especially since I play it with my wife and son (haven't taught it to my older daughter yet). Each game is extremely tense and always comes down to the wire, no matter how hopeless it may appear at certain points in the game. 

The tactics card add the perfect amount of unpredictability, but you have to be careful when playing them since they don't come into play when figuring out whether or not a flag is won.

I also can't stress how portable this game is, you can easily play it at a pub or cafe (which my wife and I do frequently). On top of that it plays quick and decisions are difficult right from the beginning. There is absolutely no wasted turns in this game, each card you play is extremely important.

This is definitely going to be an evergreen in my collection![/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Another great 2p game that plays quick but offers lots of strategy.
- Interesting take on basic poker mechanics being used to gain a majority of flags (scoring markers) on the table (5 or 3 that are all next to each other.)
- Tactics cards: help add an amount of uncertainty to the game; it becomes harder to make sure that you really have a flag scored. They let you manipulate the cards you have played in some interesting ways, but they are well balanced because you can only play one more tactics card than your opponent has played.[/i]

I'm very impressed by the strategic possibilities. As others have noted, the theme is somewhat tacked on, yet at the same time I do get the feel of battle, as one card play can end a battle and break up a potential string of 3 adjacent wins, akin to a center collapsing. 

I prefer to play without the tactics cards, although I've read comments by others that they prefer to play with them. (Curiously, I like using all such cards with Knizia's somewhat similar "Ivanhoe," but not this.) 

However, it reminds me most of "Lost Cities," though I'd give it a slight edge for the battle theme (over archaeology) and the simplicity of what feels like a traditional card game. 

I've played it with a non-gamer friend--who is on record as saying not only does he not like board games, but 'hates' them--who liked it. And, my sister, a total gamer, played this in July 2013 and rated it a "9". If you want to get a non-gamer into playing this, tell them if they like poker they should give this a try.

This IS a great 2-player game! A little battle with the cards for flag retrieval! A mix of poker and war gaming, I think! If your set of cards is highter in value than your opponents then you will collect the flag. You win when you collect enough flags! Nice game in all aspects except, I am not sure the fog card, however provides a balanced option for the game. All game strategy seems to go out the window, when this card comes out!

Much, much better than Schotten Totten.  The addition of the Tactics Cards results in increased player interaction, and playing with the 'you can only claim a marker at the start of your turn' variant gives players a chance to mess with each other even more.

I lurked on the outside, not taking the plunge to pick this one up. I had the opportunity to have it taught to me at a convention and that made all of the difference. I am really glad to have this in my collection. I suck at the strategy but suspect that this will improve as I play it a bit more.

Great filler, kind of in the bottom 1/3 in terms of complexity on my "games my wife will play with me" list. Don't love that you have to memorize poker hands to play it well -- for whatever reason, poker hand priority never found its way into my brain. Other than that, very fun. Smart-and/but-mathy, per standard Knizia.

RATING: 5
Same comments as Schotten Totten obviously, that the reason for rating this quite a bit lower than average is that I always felt my destiny was chosen for me. I know I'm going to get every second card from the deck. Whether I choose this combination path or the other is simply based on probabilities, and hope, based on not much information. And then we find out later whether I'd chosen right or not. This version I guess is slightly 'better' with the added chaos of the battle cards, but not enough to make me want to play more.

Nowadays, a little too dry and boring for my wife and me.

RATING: 9
Such a simple but tense two player card game.  I like it a bit better than Lost Cities because any card can be played in any column.  I also appreciate not having to count a ton of VP's at the end; first to claim 5 flags or 3 adjacent flags wins. Luck can easily be a factor, but a cunning player will win more often than not.  One of the better two player only games out there, IMO.

[i]Very[/i] cool little game: this one has the Knizia magic.  One characteristic of Knizia's designs is diminishing possibilites as the game progresses. Battle Line is like Samurai in that way.  Also, this may be the perfect travel/backpacking game, because it is so small. Knizia can do a lot with a deck of cards and 9 pawns.

After over 30 plays this one just needs to rest for a while.

This is a two-player tug-of-war-style card game in which players are trying to play various card combinations to a number of columns.  Cards are played one at a time, so you can see what kind of combinations your opponent is trying to make and try to outdo them (or decide it's not worth it).  You're limited by the cards you draw, so you might not actually be able to put out the optimum combo.  Additionally, each card is unique, so you can be on the lookout for specific cards, and figure out whether they've already been played, or you might draw them in the future.  There's a surprising amount going on in this simple game, and I really enjoyed it.

This is such a well designed and thought provoking game. Very few rules but each card you play is incredibly tense and you always feel like you're the one making the lead. You can't give too much information away as to what you're playing and once an opponent does, you can capitalize on it.

The artwork is fine and the theme makes sense although it's not incredibly strong for either. The card quality is typical GMT, stiffer cardboard that really can't take a riffle shuffle.

I usually play with the tactics cards, but sometimes when I don't want that additional level of depth, I just leave them out. The game still feels very deep even without them.

It's almost like salary negotiations: whoever declares a number first loses unless they hold all the right cards. The tension is created by having to form a new line and not knowing the best card to lead. There is the element of foiled plans when you realize your opponent has already played one of the cards you needed. There is the agony of waiting to draw that last card you need, hoping your opponent isn't hoarding it away in his hand.

Quick. Easy. Strategic. It is Lost Cities and Poker combined into one game.

RATING: 8
A perfectly similar to Schotten-Totten, well, only that this one goes up to ten
(and hand limit is 7 cards, so it's not _perfectly_ similar...)

I Schotten-Totten a bit better. Hand limit of 7 adds a bit more control over your hand and lowers the dependency on luck on some situations. But the cards go up to ten. That adds too much more burden to players!

The art and theme in Schotten-Totten is a lot better and that's why I rate it a bit higher.

Enjoyable, with some tough choices.  I don't like it quite as much as Emu Ranchers, which has a lot of the same decisions, but player interaction comes from battles over the discard pile, rather than a head to head conflict. Battle Line probably has the same amount of luck as Emu Ranchers, but it feels less appropriate in the head-to-head battle. Still, a fun game that I'll play when I'm in the mood.

Played with my girlfriend and she likes how it offers more depth and decision making than Lost Cities. I enjoy the trick taking aspect of it. It reminds me of Big 2 poker game.

---- Update ----
I was shocked that my girlfriend didn't know how to play poker. That is why she was having more of a hard time grasping the mechanics and she always thought 3 of the same color is smaller than a straight.

---- Update ----
My girlfriend compared this with Haggis and both games are "meh" to her.

Maybe the finest 2p I've ever played. I couldn't care less for the "powers" cards, but the basic card-to-card skirmish is simply brilliant. People compare this to Lost Cities but I can't agree.

Graciosillo juego de cartas que intenta simular un frente de batalla entre dos ejércitos de la antigüedad: los macedonios de Alejandro Magno y los Persas del petardo de Darío. El juego consiste en ir agrupando cartas iguales o correlativas en los diferentes puntos del frente de batalla que superen a las que ha agrupado el contrario. Las ilustraciones de las cartas dejan bastante que desear, no así la calidad de las mismas, que son de un material como plastificado bastante bueno. Para pasar un ratillo cuando no se juegue al de los Pingüinos ni al de los trenes esos del Cairo.

The tactics cards keep comebacks possible, as the player who's losing can get a great tactic and keep themselves alive.  Also adds some theme to this otherwise simple card game.  Excellent game.

The difference between Battle Line and Schotten Totten is the 10's in each color. But it's a huge difference. With ST you end up with all cards in play on the last turn (or at least in hand). With BL you're easily left with cards in your hand and possibly even the deck. This also forces some bad plays (because running out of spots to play cards in) and might ruin a set.

I've played several games of each but am unable to decide which is better.

Wife LOVES this game. Super simple gameplay with incredible tension.

I personally prefer not playing with tactic cards and it makes the game completely strategic rather than getting the right tactic card at the right time and completely changing the board.

This is one of my favourite games.  Great tension throughout.  Has the spirit of Lost Cities but with more gamer feel to it.  Everyone who I've played it with so far (including my wife) have all enjoyed it.  Very highly recommended for a quick 2 player game.

Excellent simple abstract card game. Only played against the iPad because I rarely play two player games. It would be a good filler game and I have seen it played with three

Lost cities feels a little more interactive. But the scoring makes it more difficult when played in person.

A surprisingly good 2-player game. Better than the popular Lost Cities, which is in some ways a similar game. BL definitely has much more strategy and tougher decision making than LC, and even its theme is more plausable.

I have only played the game without the tactics cards, and it is a great game without them. I will update this note after I have played it with the tactics cards, although I'm a little worried they may take away from the purity and elegant simplicity of the game and introduce too much chaos.

Update: Chicago Poker replaced Battleline in our group and now that has been replaced by Defenders of the Realm Battlefields. It is the difference between classic Risk and 2210.



After Titan: the Arena and Galaxy:the Dark Age, the very best of the Knizia card games.  Lots of strategy, lots of opportunity,never enough time.  Note: the theme has nothing to do with the game.  I prefer to play with out the "wild cards" i.e. the tactical cards.

What a great, easy to play, yet exciting little gem this is. Ultra portable, deep and engrossing. I had the good fortune to find a different version of Battle Line. With different I mean the artwork. The game is just good old Battle Line by Knizia.

I live in Hong Kong (but am Dutch) and recently I discovered a great boardgame shop here. Anyway I picked up the Chinese version of Battle Line. Which is, IMHO, superior in quality and overall look compared with the regular release.

Its comes in a very well produced sturdy box (size; two decks of cards next to eachother) with an illustration of two Chinese general of the cover.

Inside are two compartments, one for the main deck and one of the special cards and flags. Flags, this time there are REAL miniature flags, and not some generic pawns. The little flags are very well made. It are Chinese style war flags made of pewter. The cards itself are of a very good quality (better than the original) and have very nice illustrations on it... again, sorry to say, better than the original. (and no, I am not the producer of salesman of this version) I just am very enthousiastic about this version. Its sleek, better produced and more affordable. Slightly more than half of the original price. (approx. 11 us$) The only "downside" is that the writings on the card are in Chinese, the rule book (nicely printed in color with illustrations) are in Chinese too. But even though I can't read Chinese, I don't care, since the rules are exactly the same as the original.

To cut it short, I highly recommend this neatly produced, great looking little gem! You can find it here: http://wargames.com.hk/oscommerce/product_info.php?products_id=3581

I'd played Schotten-Totten online, and I was worried that I wasn't going to like the random element introduced by the tactics cards in Battle Line. But actually they're implemented really well. The restriction that you can only have one more played than your opponent is crucial and they add to the 'race' element of claiming flags.

The randomness near the end killed any sort of strategy forming in the mid game. I don't mind RNG games, but I like when the feeling is uniform throughout the game. Pick one or the other, while this game mixes the two and I guess it's just not my cup of tea. I'll either play Poker if I want strategy, or Hive, or I'll play Exploding Kittens or Bang! if I want a silly game where a good draw can wreck my opponents.

Very well balanced brinksmanship game. The idea of hiding (witholding) your second card in each line until the other guy commits is key. Combine this with dumping a card to a losing battle line to win in a different column by proving your opponent can't make the set is what sets this game apart.

A simple but very strategic game.  I'm impressed by the complexity of the seemingly simple decisions.  It's very difficult to decide when to just give up on certain flags, or when to keep going.

I've never played this game with the Tactic cards yet, because I haven't felt the game was really lacking anything that necessitated the extra options.  I definitely suggest playing without them for a while first to see if you agree.

This is a 2 player only game, designed by Reiner Knizia.

Gameplay consists of two opponents who face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags. Winning a flag is decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.

A great game that combines two ideas: making poker hands and area control/majority. The tactics cards seem extremely powerful but they can clog up hand space since there are only certain times when you can play them. Proving to your opponent why you can take a flag is pretty neat. Even though there's a surprising amount of depth in this tiny game, I feel like I pursue the same strategy every time, which is trying to be as flexible as possible to leave my options open.

A quick and solid two player game I can break out and play with my wife or a friend.  Easy to explain, easy to set-up, and probably the only Knizia game that I kinda like.

Was impressed since my first play. A very balanced game, and gives you a several options of how to manage your luck of the draw. The tactical cards provides a way to counter a losing position or reinforce a wining one - the limitation of when you can play keeps the tactical cards from overwhelming the game. Will be a popular 2 player filler.

An other good and simple Knizia. More tactical than Lost Cities but there his still a fair amount of luck that might not be suitable for high strategy gamers. The game his so simple it can easily be explain in a few minutes. One big point in his favor, my girlfriend likes it.

Un autre jeu de Knizia simple et bon. Plus tactique que Lost Cities il y a tout de même un certain niveau de chance qui peut déplaire au fervant amateurs de stratégie pure. Le jeu est si simple qu'il peut facilement être expliqué en quelques minutes. Un gros point en sa faveur, ma blonde l'aime bien.

Don't come near me with the Tactics cards. They take a great game of managing/balancing (up to) 9 simultaneous poker hands and add an element of "look what I found!" that just creates this artificial sense of drama, this insistence that there always needs to be a dramatic Hail Mary available to the player in second place. It's too damn gamey; just let the better player be better -- it's OK. GMT has such a raging hard-on for unpredictability and "gotcha!" moments and for me it kills this game. You're already managing unpredictability and imperfect information because it's a card game; having to deal with asymmetrical unevenly-balanced special power cards on top of that is just piling it on. This is an excellent traditional-feeling card game without the Tactics cards.

I suspect the best way to play this game is to use the Schotten-Totten rules and card distribution (no 10's and no tactics cards.)  That creates a very tense and enjoyable experience as cards get played.  I've played a couple times with tactics cards and it's still a good game, but the luck factor goes up significantly.

A typical Knizia game that reminds me of Lost Cities but this one is much harder and even a tad vicious. Keeping an overview over all the cards that have been played both by yourself and the opponent can be quiet the drill. It takes a few plays to become fluid in this game, but then it is a very dense and focused two-player skirmish. I do like it, not keen on the 'theme' or the artwork but it is a Knizia so that is what I had to expect really.

A fun, quick, two-player card game. Some difficult decisions to be made about card placement. It always feels like your opponent has better cards than you, but a lot of that is just player posturing. There are many other two-player games I would rather play.

Great little game.  I like filler games to have something that accelerates the game so it stays exciting despite its simplicity.  Battle Line definetly accelerates with the number of available plays diminishing as the game progresses.  This also make initial card play very important.  The tactics cards are a nice addition.

RATING: 10
Our favorite "we've only got 30 minutes before bed" game. We replaced the pawn shaped flags with colorful wooden buttons from a toy store and stored the game in a small deck box. Surprising amount of strategy for such a simple game. I've taught it to a bunch of people now and I always tell them "about half way through the game you're going to have an 'a hah!' moment". Never fails.

Variant #1: We usually play without the tactics cards, but recently we tried this variant and liked it. Remove one of the tactics cards and place the other nine under the flags. Whenever a player claims a flag, the OTHER player gets the tactics card that was under it. This does not count against your card limit (i.e. you may still have seven regular cards no matter how many tactics cards you've acquired).

Variant #1a: As in #1 but the tactics card must be played on the next turn or is discarded face up. Discarding does not count as a turn.

Updated to a 10 as the game just gets more fun the more we play it.

I backed "Solitaire for Two" on kickstarter mostly so I could have a set of tiles to play this on a park bench on a windy day. Also picked up Rummikub for the same reason, but I'm still working out the best way to modify the Rummikub tiles to support six suits.

Really good game. Simple rules but offers some nice depth. Plays different every time. I can never decide if I like this game over Lost Cities but it doesn't matter because I'm happy owning both. Playing your cards against your opponents choices is satisfying but waiting to just react is not good enough because of needing to prove you are still in it vs. already being beaten(for each battle). The inclusion of the action cards is awesome and the limitation of either player only being able to play one more than what the other has played is genius.

Kilgore's Bogeyman Redesign.

The upside:
- Which formation to go for a flag and with which cards makes for an interesting value acessment of your hand for the entire game.
- If you look very deep in your heart you'll fell like your actually fighting for those pieces.
- Almost every game ends in a close game.
- The redesign of Kilgore is superb.

The downside:
- The cards you get define your strategy for the flags your fighting in the moment, and if the cards don't help you...
- The theme is...wait, what?

I enjoy the facade you can put on when playing the different flags to deter your opponent (who might actually have better cards which would beat you) from playing on the same flag, thus stalling long enough to gain you the cards you need/having them play the cards that could beat you elsewhere. I cannot find anyone who will consistently play me because no one I play with sees this strategy and therefore complains that "I just don't get the good cards."

Always good to see poker hands in a Knizia game, especially in a fast paced game such as this. Works well, and the GMT-inspired theme makes it more interesting than Knizia's usual themes.

Poker seems to work well in his games - Taj Mahal is another great poker mechanic. But this is fast and furious, with some simple tactics and risk taking to give the game some legs.

Okay card game, but nothing special. Battle cards are hoplites, chariots, elephants, etc in five colors and with numbers from 1-10. Also a small deck of tactics cards that have various effects. Opposing players place cards one at a time to build "formations" (really three-card poker hands like three-of-a-kind, flush, etc). Attempt to defeat opponent's "formations" and capture flags set between the players. First player to capture three adjacent flags or five flags overall wins. A decent filler for two people.

Great game for two. Easily the most played game with my wife. One of the few games that both of us are always happy to play. I can't really say that the tactics card improved the game - but they make it different. I probably prefer the game without them, but there is not a lot in it. Its nice to have the choice. We must have played well over 100 games (probably closer to 200) and I am starting to burn out on it a bit. Got our copy signed by Reiner Knizia at Cheltenham Science Festival 2012.

Another entry into the series I like to call Reiner Knizia's: Math.

Jokes aside Battle Line is an outstanding two-player card game where you're trying to make "formations" out of cards in certain number/color/suit sequences which have varying strength based on the probability of you actually getting the cards to make it. Additionally it brings concepts of positioning into play as between each stack of cards representing a formation is a "flag" when a number of cards are placed your formation is complete and if your formation beats your opponent's formation (or you can show that based on the cards already visible on the table it is impossible for your opponent to to beat you) you take the flag. Add to this interesting and occasionally brain burning dimension tactics cards which can really mix things up and you have a very interesting, easy to learn and play little game.

I can certainly see the comparisons between Battle Line and Lost Cities/Poker.  Battle Line is deeper than both those.  I miss the chaos of Lost Cities when I play Battle Line, but I enjoy the increase in depth.  Battle Line is certainly thinkier.  The main problem is that if I want to play a two player thinky card game, I will go for Odin's Ravens every time.  If I had never played Odin's Ravens, Battle Line would be a smash hit--a great success.  As it is, I don't know how much play I'm going to get out of it.

At first this felt a lot like Lost Cities but as we played through the game I realized that there was a lot more to it. Unfortunately in my first game I forgot the rule about only being able to play 1 more special card than your opponent.  I think I played about 6 more special cards than he did and the game was easily won.  After re-reading the rules and playing correctly the game was much more balanced.  The tough decisions about where to place your cards and which deck to draw from make this one of my favorite two player games.  The box that contains the game is about twice as large as it needed to  be and I often leave it behind when I travel with the game, a small annoyance.

I've downgraded my score, now that I can win the game more consistently. The card drawing mechanic just adds an unacceptable amount of luck to the game, which is only boosted by the tactics cards. Lost Cities offers similar feel, with less 'take that' game play. (lost cities is still a bad, luck driven game)

ONE OF THE BEST "LIGHT" 2P GAMES AVAILABLE 
Reading the BGG reviews convinced me to buy this one.  I'm very glad that I did.  Super little tactical card game.  If you like Lost Cities but want something with a little more depth, buy this game NOW.  A game with a very high enjoyment to dollar ratio.  The cards are cut from lightweight stock but are decent quality, certainly not "crap" as some would have you believe.  Someone explain to me why my 8YO son consistently beats me 2 plays out of 3 - oh yeah, he's smarter than I am.  He enjoyed the game but lost interest after a dozen plays or so.  BUY IT NOW!

Nine stones are set in a line between the two players. Players alternate playing cards one at a time on their side of the stones, creating sets of 3 cards at each stone. The objective is to win either 5 of the 9 stones, or 3 stones in a row. Like poker, rarer card sets beat more common card sets. The card deck consists of 6 colors with denominations 1-10.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game. There are times when it is agonizing to take a turn, because you are holding out for a specific card. It's a good brain burner, and a lot of fun to play. Theme has no bearing on the mechanics, but the Tactics cards add a twist (or you can play without them). Components: Artwork is good. The cards are thin, and my rules appear to be a poor quality B&W XEROX. The box is way too large for a simple card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple, easy to learn rules that appeal to gamer and non-gamer alike and belie the brain ache this game induces - the more things progress the tougher the decisions become.  An ability to quickly identify your least worst option will hold you in good stead. Very good game.

RATING: 8.1
This is a two player card game by Reiner Knizia (and it is very Knizia - similar in a lot of ways to Lost Cities). Players draft cards one at a time from their hands to nine positions. They are trying to make sets of cards, in order of value from Hordes (no set), Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Straight Flush. These sets capture flags. The game can be won in two ways. A dramatic victory in which one player breaksthrough and captures three adjacent flags, or a slow war of attrition resulting in an envelopment where a player captures a majority of the flags.
The game gets increasingly tense as players choices for where to play cards diminish.

The best of Knizia's many "light" card games. (OK, that's just my opinion, and I certainly haven't come close to playing them all - but it's by FAR the best of the many I've played.) This feels similar in many ways to Lost Cities (despite being quite different in what you're trying to do), but offering a much greater variety of options. A classic example of a game with simple rules offering great tension in play, while tending to play differently every time (which is where Lost Cities falls down). My wife and I actually haven't played this since 2012 (I think, perhaps it was early 2013) and I'm unlikely to request it in the near future, as these days I prefer something a bit "meatier". But that in no way detracts from this game, which is excellent for what it is.

(11/29/2016) - [9] - As with any Knizia title, the theme is largely painted-on. Despite this, I found the game to be very enjoyable. Plenty of tension in deciding what kind of formation to work on, while hoping to work around your opponent's intentions/abilities.

What kind of a genius is Knizia? I mean, come the hell on! Where does this shit come from? He just reaches into the aether, rubs three rules together, and then this piece of goddamn GOLD falls out of the ether. This game has the same kind of classical perfection that, I don't know, like Go and Hold 'Em have. 

The tension, the way you start by probing for information, trying not to commit, trying to hold back, until you absolutely can't any more, then commit... the betting, the play of the possibilities in the opportunity space... this game is ETCHED IN SILVER AND GOLD.

Also: it's thematic. The Schotten-Totten theme didn't fit, but turning it into an ancient battle theme weirdly works... mostly because of how much of the tension is waiting for commitment, forcing yourself to commit, probing for information, etc.

NOTE: I've only played this without the special power cards, a la the original design.

Neat Knizia game is a tense affair, as your number of options of where and what to play shrinks. I like Lost Cities more, but this is a good one, with a lot of agonizing decisions to make. Tactics cards seem a bit distracting; we play without, so it's basically Schotten Totten.

After three plays, I don't think this will thrive on my table. I've won each play, and I'm not entirely convinced that luck didn't play a role. I believe there are certainly methods to use the tactics and hand management to mitigate the luck, but ultimately you're still restricted to the cards you draw. I'd be glad to try it out a few more times, but I'm not sure I'd be able to convince my SO to join along when she would rather play  Balloon Cup (which has similarities).

----------

Great, tactical filler.  It's fun, and it packs some tense decisions in a very short play time.

Tactics cards also breathe fresh life into the game and make it a bit more chaotic, which I think is a good thing.  I also like the strategy involved in the timing of tactics cards.  For example, if my wife has one more tactic card down than me and one more in her hand, I know she can't play that next card until I lay down a tactic card of my own.. so by stalling, I can make her waste a precious inventory slot in her hand.  Some people don't like the Tactics cards, but this is why I prefer BL over Schotten Totten.


This is my #2 filler, and I think everyone should have a copy in their collection.  And, if you don't want to buy the game, you can print kilgore's retheme for free.  If you are torn between BL and Lost Cities, I would DEFINITELY advise you to get BL, which is much more cerebral than Lost Cities (which can pretty much be played on autoplay).

--Oct2004-- Now I need to play it.  Schotten-Totten is great; need to find out what the extra tactic cards bring to the mix.
--Apr2007-- Hey, those tactics cards are pretty fun.  I'm happy to play either this version or "plain" Schotten-Totten.  On the other hand, this one ranks an epsilon lower: I think there's a bit more delightful selection-angst in the the other version; 6 cards and suits of 1-9 are a bit tighter than 7 cards with 1-10.

Quoting Alex Brown on this game: "This game taught me how much I like theme and assymetry."

First impressions were already negative: inefficient box, lots of empty space, plain and unillustrated rules, cardboard cards.T his game sparked my wife's strongest negative feelings of any game yet. I too was expecting something else for the high rating. The theme is loose (Knizia), the game is mathematical (Knizia) and add to that the presentation is lackluster... It isn't for us. We're not poker players either.

Battle Line is another great two-player game from Knizia, kind of like Lost Cities but with more space to change plans and mess with your opponent.

My go to 2p card game. a damn near perfect game, on of Reiner's best. I do prefer the Shotten-Totten rules (without the thematic insult to Scots), so I've thrown away the tactics cards. They turn a perfect game of deduction, bluffing, and hand management into something lesser. I like games with inserted chaos, but not in this category (I don't own Rage for the same reason--funny special event cards are for ameritrash or thematic games, IMO--I don't even really like them in euros, with a few exceptions).

great great game for the poker player in your life. I guarantee they will love this one. My brother won't play much besides his beloved poker, but he'll play this...and he's wicked at it as well.

copy for trade: has no tactics cards.

Neat little game. It's a classic in my home. More choices than in Lost Cities. More agonizing without tactics cards, because there is less chaos. Really bad production. Thin cards, plastic pawns, I had to pay 20 bucks where Schotten-Totten came for half the money and with better components. Schotten-Totten's theme  is less serious than in Battle Line and so I like it more.

My wife and I both like this game after a number of plays without the tactics cards.  Battle line has everything I love in a game; inexpensive, fits in your pocket, simple to teach, plays fast, and can be a real brain burner.  However, it just feels a little dry to me...  I need to try this with the tactics cards!  

UPDATE: 7 now an 8.  Love the tactics cards!  This is the game we bring to just about everywhere, you don't need much room to play it, and it fits in your pocket.

Once a month my favorite game store hosts an all day gaming event for the clubs. I try to buy something to help pay for my table space. Today I bought Battleline. Even though it's not really a wargame I was looking for a 15 minute game that required no set up time. Since it was on sale, I bought it. Richard hated it with the Tactics cards in play. I agreed, so we played without them. Great quicky filler! I'll keep it in my game tub at all times.

RATING: 8
Fun game! Nine flags make up the battle line. The winner is the first to breach the line (by claiming three adjacent flags) or envelop the line (by claiming any five). Players take turns making troop card "formations" behind their side of each flag. Formations are essentially three card poker hands, with a wedge (straight flush) beating a phalanx (three of kind) and so forth. A small number of tactics cards give the game just enough variety to break inflexible strategies. Normally a flag is claimed when each player has complete formations on their sides, but I love that you can force your opponent to surrender a flag if you can prove their formation will be inferior when it's finished. The girlfriend didn't like this game, although she didn't hate it. As much as I like the tactics cards, maybe next time I'll show her Battle Line's cousin Schotten Totten instead and see if that's a bigger hit. See Schotten Totten for a detailed comparison between it and Lost Cities.

Such a simple yet great 2 player card game, I like battle line way better than lost cities.

The theme and mechanics of the game might seem disconnected but I believe it to simulate the role of a commander surprisingly well. 

To do well in this game you must have patience and know when to take a risk vs play it safe, you can sacrifice a battle to win the war. Deduction can be used to help hone your tactics but you also need to know when you can push your luck.

This game's rating has slowly climbed from a 6 to a 9.5 over a one year period. At first I found the game only mildly interesting but with each subsequent game I've grown to appreciate the near constant tension this simple game can create. The requirement to play a card at the beginning of your turn often conflicts with your need to limit the courses of action to which you'll become commited. And the need to guard against a breakthrough victory adds a whole other level of concern to the game. And, finally, the ability to claim a flag by proving your opponent cannot prevail, thus closing down their formation and potentially squeezing them into a position where the only good card to play is no cards at all - but you must play a card! - is delicious. Having all the cards you need in hand for a given flag provides a welcome breather as you can throttle down the tension over the next few turns and pray that the cards you draw will also help keep the pressure off. Sadly, these breaks seldom last long. But, then, that's also a good thing.

The game is easy to learn and easy to teach and has gone over well with both gamers and non-gamers to whom I've introduced it. So, to my mind, it serves well as a two-player gateway game that both I and the new gamer can enjoy. The production quality is about the only thing that bothers me. I prefer the theme of this version (seriously - Scotsmen battling over the placement of pasture boundary stones?) and the art is fine but the cards are cheap, thin, and untextured and the edges show wear almost immediately. Since I expect to put this game to heavy use, having the main component begin to break down from the first playing is disappointing. Especially considering that despite its being only a simple card game its price is fairly high and as such discourages keeping multiple replacement copies on hand. With that in mind, I've invested in a couple of copies of Schotten Totten (with the tactics cards). The card quality is noticably improved and the cost is less but I do miss the military theme and especially the elephant (10's) cards...

A fun, small game of trying to get higher valued poker combinations on your side of the line in order to meet one of the several victory conditions.

2-player card game how I like it: filler length, but with interesting strategy. There's bluffing, tactical management (to leave formations flexible), risk-taking and intelligent hoarding of cards. Every game is different, and the decisions are tough. Think they could have done a better job with the illustrations. The epitome of an elegant game.

Schotten Totten is better, so just take the 10s out when you play this. I like Battle Line's theme and pawns more.

Gets a little routine after too many plays, especially if it's against the same opponent.

I've never actually played with the tactics cards, so I cannot comment on how they affect the game.  The base game, however, is quite interesting on its own.  Sure the draw of cards has some effect on what you can do, so you may not always be able to make the most optimal move.  Such us life.  You do, however, have to make the best with what you have.  I do like that paying attention to the cards played can allow you to claim spots that you might otherwise have to wait for as well.  [03/13/2011]

[29 plays] Excellent little 2 player card game. The GMT cards are nice looking, but a little thin. However, they will hold up just fine if treated nicely. Mine still look brand new.

Many comments say that this is "just like" Lost Cities. Perhaps emotionally I can see the comparisons , as the alternating card play gets quite tense as the game progresses, but otherwise I think the comparison is overstated. The flag capture mechanic adds a very pleasant angst to the contest, and I also enjoy how it eliminates the need for mathematical calculation to determine the game winner.

This is a good game for alomst anyone's collection. (yes, even if you own Lost Cities)

I discovered this game when I asked my FLGS owner for a recommendation and listed one of the games I liked as Lost Cities. Well...so long Lost Cities! This game has totally replaced it for me. I think it does a similar thing, but it gives you more interesting choices. It adds just a bit more depth, while still being an accessible, quick 2-player game that isn't a brain tax.

Won the first game and lost the next 7 or so. Michelle says it has too much luck, but I'm not so sure anymore. I think she is just being modest. On the other hand, even though she wins all the time, she doesn't think it's any fun, so there is that. 

Update: So, I asked her about it again. She said that, while there is strategy and quite a bit to think about, the central mechanic is just kind of meh. Even though she wins, it's just not exciting to play. Which is to say, she'd rather lose a game of RftG or A:ACBaS than play Battle Line. 

I wonder if it'd go down better with nicer looking art? The game is about as dry as it gets... I honestly don't understand what GMT was thinking with the  retheme.

Note: We play with Schotten-Totten rules (#1-9, 6 cards in hand, and no tactics cards). Michelle says she prefers it this way.

Ipod version

I cannot rate higher a game that involves luck

but except from that,  I find it a wonderful game, tense, involving, fast, simple yet deep. The tactics cards add a very nice extra dimension. At the end of the day, although the draw deck has to feed you with good material to work on, I believe for the most part the better strategy will win.

I am already considering a medieval Japan custom version

UPDATE> After more than 500 games with my ipod, I come to the following conclusion: a lucky game is a lucky game, strategy is secondary in those games. In this game, draw the wrong cards and you are lost no matter what you do.

UPDATE> After more than 1000 games I decided I should buy the actual card game to play with friends. It's a sure investment.

Battle Line is my favorite 2-player card game. In this game, players compete for Flags by playing down cards from their hand in sets of three (albeit one card at a time). There are six suits (colors) of cards, with values running from 1-10. Each of the 9 Flags is available for competition. Some sets beat other sets, allowing you to claim a Flag. Winning requires a breach (claiming 3 adjacent Flags) or an envelopment (claiming any 5 Flags). Special Tactics cards break specific rules of the game, adding a strong element of the unknown. You can remove the Tactics cards to play Schotten-Totten, and added bonus.

I just love the blend of analytical thinking and chance in this game. To win, you need to keep track of what's going on and remain flexible. If you become too attached to winning a particular Flag, it can spell your doom. Knizia's Battle Line is heavier than his LotR: the Confrontation, but just light *enough* to play fairly briskly. I definitely prefer Battle Line to Lost Cities, which is also a good game, perhaps because Battle Line feels a little less "mathy". Every game has been fun, and more strategies have become apparent with each play. This game truly gives you many interesting/desirable options, and then makes you choose only one - based upon an analysis of the playing field, your own resources, and your grasp of opponent psychology.

Battle Line also plays fast enough we fall prey to the "just one more game" syndrome - which can be a curse if you have to get up early the next morning! [To my chagrin - just a little :) - my wife beats me at this game most of the time, and we maintain a pretty intense rivalry.]

(I have the bootlegged / fan/made "The Simpsons" and "Star Wars" versions of this game, printed via Artscow and PrinterStudio respectively). Even though I've been playing the game only with the most basic of rules and not even using any command cards or fan-made terrain expansions, I find this game provides an absolutely thrilling two-player experience. I can't wait to try out the commands and terrains to amp it up even more. A really simple game at heart, but like all good games - easy to learn, hard to master. Love it.

RATING: 8
This is a Fab two player card game.  I prefer this retake on Schotten Totten as this version has kooky Tactics cards and a wonderful rule that keeps them in check.  Too many tough choices.  This may be the greatest pure hand management game in my book.  Why would anyone ever play Lost Cities when this bad boy is around?  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I really like this one over Lost Cities. Theme seems to play into the game more than some other Eurogames. I tend to seperate the Tactic cards equally (and randomly outside of each side having either one of the Character cards). This solved the tactics bug for me.

As with a lot of Knizia games, this one starts out on a simple concept, but has tough decisions during the play.  After two plays, the first round didn't go so well as we both tried to slug it out over a couple of flags early on, and there didn't seem to be much of a game.  In the second game, we started to play with some strategy, and the game improved vastly.  I like this one, and see myself playing it more.
----
This one still gets trotted out on occasion, and is a preferred game for two players when I have the opportunity.  There is something about the tension of the game and building the formations that really appeals to me.  I recently (Dec 2008) played with a friend, and we ended up playing seven times in a row because we were so taken with it.

This one is a brain burner! It has no theme but if you can find a partner that enjoys the strategy then this is a great game. 

This is the only game that we have owned that my wife is not willing to play. During our first game, my wife said, "this is stupid, I am just laying cards, I have no idea what you are doing, go play this with your smart friends!" Needless to say we have not played together since.

A very good game, though I'm not wild about the special powers cards.  I just leave them in the box now, which makes this game into Schotten-Totten, if I'm not mistaken.  So I guess I'm not really playing Battle Line anymore; maybe I should move this to Schotten-Totten's page.  But then, this is the one I own, so I guess I'll leave it.  Well, wasn't that a productive digression!

- After my initial plays, I didn't see what all the fuss was about - seemed decent but that's all (6/10). 
- With more plays, though, I have really started to appreciate this game: simple rules, plays (relatively) quickly, but with lots of angst deciding which card to play, and where. Although the components are uglier, this is a MUCH better GAME than Lost Cities: more options, less luck, more to think about, more fun! -> 8/10
- Well, it seems I always want to play this so it's up to a 9/10 now!

Pseudo bluffing game where you're balancing the need to hide your cards from your opponent and bluff them into thinking you're strong in certain suits.

Knizia takes an incredibly simple concept, spiffs it up a bit, applies a nice military theme, and voila!  An excellent two player card game that scores mucho points for being minimalist, portable, easy to teach, quick to play, pleasingly strategic, and perfectly themed (divide and conquer!)  I've introduced children as young as six to this game without trouble, and even my heavy military strategy buddies dig this little game.  All around appeal is a great thing.

Revised: upped the rating.  My enjoyment grows as time passes.  Remarkable game.

05/22/09 Another Revision:  Up to a perfect 10.  What more can I say?  This is the perfect 2-player card game.

RATING: 8
I rate it the same as Schotten for its elegant simplicity yet deep gameplay.  The tactics cards add some chaos and luck to the mix, so I slightly prefer Schotten.  However, if you buy Battle instead, you can always remove the tactics cards if you wish and if you like them you're all set, so it's probably the better buy due to its flexibility.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an abstract take on a trick-taking game.  The game is won by collecting a certain number of flags that are set up in the middle of the table.  These are collected by playing cards of different numbers and colors on your side of those flags.  Once both players have a set of three cards on either side of a flag the player with the highest set based on a hierarchy very similar to poker rules (a flush of the same color beats a straight run which beats 3 of a kind which beats high value and of course a "straight flush" beats everything).

Abstract and trick-taking games aren't my thing and for a quick two-player activity I'd much rather play something else.  It is made a little bit more interesting by the special ability cards and I like the idea that you can never play more than 1 more than your opponent played so by never playing a special ability card you limit your opponent to playing only one during the game (and if they've drawn more than one they've just wasted those draws).  This still isn't enough to make it very interesting to me though.

100522: 5 plays, rating 7. 

Great first impression. A fast and tense game with a lot of important decisions in a short playing time. Although the theme is very weak the game is still fun. Small components make it perfect for traveling. We are going to play this game many times this summer, and in the future. Mostly because of its convenience and that it is fun for the amount of time you put in. But I will not be pondering over how to play when I am trying to sleep. So engaging is not this game.

Battle Line has been one of my favorite two player games for a few years now. It is easy to teach and learn. And it has a good number of choices and strategies. But what makes it great is the tension. I have rarely found any game that results in this much tension. It seems from the opening play you have the screws on you. Each progressive card play increases the tension. By the end, you are squirming in your seat and searching for that one card that will complete your last set. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
Great filler game to introduce non-gamers to board games.
Plays in 10-15 minutes. Lends itself to easy teaching as it is based on several basic poker hands (you create 3 card hands).  Such an elegant game with some deduction as more and more cards are laid out, to see how high your chances are of pulling off stronger poker sets to beat opponent. There's always tension as you try to reveal what poker set you're starting as slowly as possible but your hand size forces you to lay out cards and commit to a poker set usually earlier than you'd like to commit to it.
A "Classic" quick strategy game!

After several more plays, I'm lowering the rating to a 7.2 from a 9.5. I still stand by my original review, but I felt like it didn't quite retain the same excitement with each subsequent play. Still a very good game. Will never turn down a play.

Original review -

Very close to perfect for me. Extremely simple rules, streamlined gameplay. A TON of tension. Brainburner. Games will last around 30 minutes. We play without the "special effect" cards (forget the name of them).

Two cons: Artwork/theme are extremely bland but that's not really the point. The other one is that the box is way bigger than the what the game needs. It probably could have fit into a "Star Realms" size box.

I originally played Schotten-Totten back in the early 2000s.  I liked the system, but didn't like the artwork.  When GMT republished the game, I bought it as soon as it came out.  I am a wargamer at heart!

I am also a fan of the game's Tactics cards.  I know that S-T purists aren't fond of these cards, but I think they help add more variety to the game.  Add the flag capture advance rule, and this game is superior to S-T (in my opinion).

RATING: 7
[GMT 2004 edition, 1st printing] {Ancient; set collection, utility cards, drafting} Battle Line is a tactical 2p card game with moderate confrontation. Since it's quite confrontational, my wife doesn't like it much.

The theme of Battle Line is just pasted on. Quality of the cards is very disappointing: too thin to be durable. In addition, the artwork is quite horrible! 

Luck in card draw may marginally affect the result of a play; I believe skillful card playing is more crucial to winning. Without a good plan and being ignorant of the opponent's strategy, one can hardly win this game. If a player pays attention to the details, it's not difficult to guess the cards in opponent's hand (in particular the number cards).

'Proving you win' is the core of Battle Line. This encourages players compete aggressively for the flags. If you claim a flag before your opponent places all 3 cards, you will make him have 1 fewer place to discard useless cards and he cannot "buy time" to wait for a better card in the draw. Another good rule is the special winning condition, which forces players decide carefully which battle field to give or take.

[Comparison] Compared to Schotten Totten, Battle Line is more dynamic with the tactic cards. The one card threshold is a nice rule to thwart a player from hoarding and abusing the tactic cards; without this rule, Battle Line may become too chaotic to control. It's usually a good tactic to use the tactic cards late so that the opponent is forced to withhold the tactic cards until you move. This provides you more flexibility and limits possible move of your opponent. With wise moves, tactic cards can destroy a sure-win proof dramatically.

[Comparison] I prefer Battle Line to Lost Cities because it, with the tactic cards, isn't just a pure calculation game and it is less luck-driven. The tactic cards provide many tactical options, the 'proving you win' rule creates additional excitement and the special winning condition makes the game more fun. Nonetheless, I like both games as they are fun and tactical.

Great card game. Kind of like playing a multiple number of small poker hands. In fact I think of the 'formations' as poker hands rather than the names the rules give them, like phlanx, I have no idea what combo of mcards that is. When it comes to the tactics cards, I could live without them.

There's so much game here for its size--I often take it camping and back-packing.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Ancient Warfare - Card Game - 2-Player - 30mins

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] Interesting, short card game that feels like a cross between Poker and Lost Cities.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Good game, will gladly play.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

This game took a while to grow on me. Bought it a long time ago, played it a few times back then but it didn't grab me. It spent years on the shelf.

Then I tried it again, and after the first difficult game (what's this formation again?...) it started to come together. There's an interesting game here.

It's pretty short, but requires some thought and good play to win. The main thing is not to commit too early and pay attention what cards have already come out. The more information you have, the better you can play your cards. Sometimes it's better to just give up some location rather than take a risk on a promising or important one.

I'm still undecided on the tactics cards - it seems that who-ever takes the most ends up winning the game. Needs some more plays to decide.

If you like Lost Cities but want to try something more challenging, you owe it to yourself to try Battle Line.

A classic 2-player experience.  I may be burning out a bit, but I still will play this anytime I'm asked.  The rules are very easy but the decisions are what makes this one work.  Its so tough to stay flexible while commiting to certain strategies.

EDIT 11/20/2014
After playing a bunch of Battle Line with my mom this week I have come to the conclusion that this is one of my all-time favorites.  It's a perfect game for 2-players.  I don't think anyone has ever done so much with so little.

Card game with a well-worn mechanic, that of attempting to create runs of numbers/colours from the cards in your hand. The tactics cards bring an extra element of strategy and you have to consider all of your opponent's actions in relation to your own. The theme feels ever so slightly tagged on but there's a wealth of decisions you're confronted with and this is a game that requires a great deal of skill to play well, it just doesn't feel particularly original. Still, it's a very good game though.

As the game moves past halfway, every decision is agonizing as you try your hardest to not commit to anything you won't be able to back out of.

Initial few turns were seemingly simple. However, the game gets more involved in the process, and i was left with a feeling of having to properly manage my troop cards in the right areas. You cant win everything, you have to mind-read and postulate, and properly manage your cards.

For me, a simple game but with great replayability!

Brilliant.  Knizia at the top of his form.  Maybe my favorite dedicated 2-player game, BL is the closet you can get to open-information Poker while still maintaining room for bluffing.  If you think about it from a design POV, that's pretty hard to pull off.

On occasion to add a little variety, we play with some agreed-upon contingent of the "strategy" cards (this is an especially nice option for playing with kids); however, we usually prefer to play without them a la' Schotten Totten.  Advanced variant for flag-claiming is always better.

Enjoyable, but I don't care much for how you get half the cards in the game and your opponent gets the other half (as opposed to, say, Lost Cities where you control the card flow).

A worthy elaboration on the mechanics presented in Lost Cities. Players are able to make sets not just of similarly colored cards, but a range of three-card poker hands. The extra options adds a deduction element and increases the complexity of choosing when and where to "invest" your cards. As in Lost Cities, there are restrictions on when and where you can place a card, so timing is key, as is logic. Figuring out what your opponent is likely to be holding allows you to form combinations just good enough to win. Overplaying, or attempting to overplay a particular column more often than not gets you into trouble. In the end, it's a different animal from Lost Cities, but the family resemblance is certainly there.

The Tactics Cards are largely unnecessary, but not without their charm. That the rules restrict their play means that you can effectively choose to play without them even when you haven't outright removed them from the game.

And of course I'm happy to see that the game is being re-released under its original name: [thing=372][/thing].

Definitely one of the better two-player head-to-head games that I've played. The "poker hands" style of ranking the different formations gives you plenty of options, and then the tactics cards add further complications. It really is like a far more interesting version of Lost Cities. I get the feeling I'm not playing this very well though, unless I've been unlucky with the cards every time I've played, because I've yet to win a game of it!

Fast paced game, a bit in poker style.  Place your cards in order to achieve a better formation than your opponent.

RATING: 9.5
Hands down, my favorite card game filler. There's so much strategy and tension packed into this two-player battle. It's one of the games in which my husband and I are pretty evenly matched, so each play feels very exciting. The tactics cards add a lot; there's some decision-making involved in playing one because, while you get a definite advantage from it, you also give your opponent the ability to play one of their own. Also, Battle Line has a great mechanism for declaring victory over a flag--it's not just the first person to lay a winning hand, but rather the person who can prove their hand is superior to any their opponent might play. It's a small detail that really adds a lot to the gameplay.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In my opinion, the special-power cards  don't add much to the basic game engine underlying this game (i.e. - the elegant, simple and streamlined design found Battle Line's predecessor, Schotten-Totten), and in fact bog it down unnecessarily. But then, this packaging of the game allows players to remove the special cards and play with just the original design (which I recommend). The theme and artwork here are far more realistic and "serious" than the light, colorful, silly and cartoonish precept and presentation of Schotten-Totten (which I prefer), but gameplay sans special cards is the same. With or without the special-power cards, Battle Line is a fantastic two-player game - among my favorites.

It's a shame that Schotten-Totten has been given the dry GMT treatment.  At its core, Battle Line is a classic mathematically-tuned Knizia title.  Despite the grognard veneer, Battle Line is tactical, quick, tense, and a lot of fun.  It's also the best Knizia for 2 players.

One of my favorite two player games.  There's always time to play just once more!  It's got bluffing and press your luck elements.  There is plenty of strategic and tactical depth for such a quick game.

RATING: 7
I like the game, but the deduction element (figuring out your best move based on which cards have already been played) really makes this one take way too long for me. Hoping to get in more plays to see if I get faster at determining which cards to play. Otherwise this is just an AP nightmare.

Update: Played again without spending as much time analyzing. I liked it more this time, but maybe because of the bland presentation, this one still isn't a two-player masterpiece for me like it is for some people. I'll still reach for Jambo or Jaipur over this game any time.

The simplicity and basics of the game will leave others to doubt its true rank and ability... but this game has me wanting more. Very competitive. Luck does play a role but it is mostly strategy.

This game gets played more than any other in my collection right now. My fiance can't get enough of it. She never wants to play anything else! The rules are simple, but the flow of play creates several diverse scenarios of mini-strategies every time we play. I love the decisions in this game. And the tactic cards are perfectly designed for some unique twists. My rating started out somewhere around a 7. Over time, it has climbed and never dropped. Get this game, especially if you have a lot of 2-player opportunities.

For me, the idea of "talking my girl into playing a game" became something of the past after I had Battle Line. Now, my new challenge is "talking my girl into playing a NEW game."

The more I game, the more I realize it's important for a great game to have a well-integrated theme into the game play. Battle Line is still the best in its class, so it still get a high rating, but I'm lowering out of the 9s and locking it into a solid 8 for now.

Update 11/19/2012 - I've been playing it on my iPad a lot lately and had a few sessions against my wife again. It's just so tense that when I checked my rating on it, I felt it deserved a bump. Back up to an 8.5!

Great little game, super clever design that both provide a tense battle of wits while complementing the theme. It catches people of guard. Look dry and boring but once people try it that won't stop at one game. Excellent way to kill 20-30 mins before a serious gaming session. Must buy imo.

The mediaeval re-theme somehow tickled me more than the classic one or the comic style Schottentotten. First play was fun, a nice game for an easy going evening or at the restaurant after lunch. Astonishingly thinky for such a simple rule set. After a few more games this is straight into our rotation. Quick enough to bang out a few rounds and the game gives enough randomness to give a weaker player a solid chance to win.

RATING: 8
Best 15-minute game for two people. Period. (Yes I do own Lost Cities and I enjoy that game, too.)

It packs a lot of game in a small, short package.

It also has nice, sturdy components.

Very portable, but has a rather large footprint.

Update:  Rating stays the same, but I think this is a game that should be in nearly everyone's collection.  I eventually got rid of Lost Cities as I like this (and Balloon Cup) so much more.

Update: Up to an 8. Balloon Cup is gone too. Only Battleline remains.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4

Can you make a compelling war game that really captures something meaningful about ancient linear combat using nothing more than a slightly modified deck of playing cards and some pawns? Yes. I think you can. But Reiner Knizia actually DID.

This is a subtle game of deception and abstract maneuvers built atop a foundation of chance, probability and the unknown.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
While I happen to enjoy this,  I would have never predicted it's consistently high ratings,  given the game's design.  In essence,  it is three card poker in seven different hands.  I am a big poker fan, so it's appeal makes sense to me,  however,  I am somewhat perplexed by it's widespread popularity.  That being said,  I would play this game at any time.

Concerning this edition of the game - Battle Line - I am not enamored with the card quality,  graphic design and overall presentation of the game.  To me,  Schotten-Totten is a much preferred edition,  as the bright colored graphics and large numbers are far more functional and actually fit the theme of this game much better.  After all,  it is a light game of head to head poker comparisons,  not a re-creation of a deep tactical war.  

Once the most recent release of Schotten-Totten included the tactics cards, this was relegated to the trade pile.

I've only played a few times, and I can't decide if I like this or Schotten-totten better. I guess it depends on my mood, and how much I feel like thinking about the tactics cards. No one in my family much likes either one, so it seldom gets played. The card stock of the second edition is poor- very thin with almost no coating.

RATING: 8.75
This is one great card game, and certainly "one-ups" Lost Cities in every way!  Tense, with a hint of bluffing, I look forward to more plays of this nice little filler.  The tactical cards, while not used much in our first game, will be getting a lot of play time later!

Update: On our second play, the tactics cards proved to be a crucial element in deciding the winner (not me)!

Letter Grade: A.  Upgrades the core mechanics of Lost Cities, an already excellent game. [05-08-09]

Simply brilliant.  Feels like a thorough upgrade from Lost Cities; instead of having to manage the tense timing of each suit of cards, one has the added complexity of each suit having a direct effect on all the others.  I find the game a bundle of nerves in a very quick playing time.  Simply superb.  Feels like a steel-wire cat's cradle.

[05-08-09]: Old rating: 9.  New rating: 8.  I appreciate this game but it ultimately doesn't get enough play as Lost Cities.  Maybe this would change if my wife knew about it, but the theme and added decisions make this slightly less accessible (even if more interesting) than Lost Cities.

For such a simple looking game Battle Line has an awful lot going on. Similar to its spiritual ancestor Lost Cities, each time you lay a card feels either fantastic or disastrous. Tactics card, however, can change any fight mid-battle.

The game is lightning fast to set up, simple to teach, and reliably plays in a half hour. It's amazing how many tough decisions and interesting strategies can be packed into such a tiny box and playtime.

Battle Line is worth the hype.

A little, fast playing gem that is extremelly engaging.

This game combines perfectly tough decisions and very fast flow of play. While most games belong to only one of these seemingly opposite spheres, mr knizia delivers with extreme simplicity, yet rewarding depth. It is a most enjoyable game, one that makes me want to play it again and again even for the whole evening. (which says a lot for what is basically a filler)

On the negative side, the theme, though well made for an abstract (well done gmt!) is not as attractive to everyone, and even though I personally love it, I can understand that several players are uninterested in the war theme.

This game has really touched a soft spot on me.

This is a fun two-player strategy game. It is very easy to learn, and is quite deep. Don't let the box fool you. It looks a bit bland, and very male driven. Anyone who can grasp the idea of poker hand strengths can grasp this game.

"Next step up from Lost Cities" reputation is well deserved.  Similar place-then-draw gameplay, but more decisions to make and more thought to put into decisions.  Whereas Lost Cities can be played on autopilot, this requires a bit more than that.  This is a quick, light game that can appeal to both those just getting their feet wet in eurogames and more experienced gamers.

RATING: 8
I have never had a game toy with my affections as much as you battle line.  You tease me with 2 card straight flushes, and tempt me with three of a kind.  The second I turn my eyes away from the straight flush, the card draw punishes me for my lack of faith and commitment.  Why oh why?

Seriously,  this is one fantastic card game.  Brinksmanship, handmanagement, and a bit of double think all tied into this card game.  Intuitive, addictive, fun, and cerebral.  A keeper on all accounts.

Maybe one of these days I will try out the tactics cards, but I don't see the point.  At least they are nice enough to keep them in their own wrapper so you keep them nice and fresh.  

And since everyone compares this to Lost Cities, I will too.  They are completely different.  Both warrant a spot in any collection.

A great game to play with anyone else who likes a challenge.  Your garunteed to have to make some uncomfortable decisions, where nothing you can do is what you want to do.  But if you can keep order in your "ranks" till the end of the game, you'll probably win.  

Very much a numbers and possibilities game.

PROS: A masterpiece of light strategy, with a clever mechanic, and a lot of logic and anticipation with a pinch of poker. The Tactics cards add a great flavour to the game and I'm always tempted not play them (this way my opponent can only play one Tactics card in the entire match) but I end up using them because sometimes they are the only way to "save" some almost-lost flags. So I must conclude they're a great addition.

CONS: The box is roughly 3 times larger than the components actually require (This will always be part of my analysis since I live in Brazil and must import most of the games I buy); The components look cheap for the game price (the flags aren't even flags! Flags depicting different regions would be a great addition to theme and game value); The art and design look very raw; The cards are a strange size that is slightly larger than standard so I'm having trouble finding the appropriate sleeves for this game. Also, they could be american sized for instance, to reduce table space required. Every time I setup the game, I must first lay 9 cards side by side to measure the correct distance between flags. A small demountable bar (like in Arena: Roma II) could easily solve this and, again, add value. The rulebook is a B&W folded A4 regular paper depicting cards with the names of their colours written on them (!!!). I bought games that had WAY better components, art and design for the same price. Also some things could be better written and explained in the rules.

Not too bad for an Abstract Fan.  The good thing about his game is that it is more likely to get played at home.  There is a Random element to the game that I am uncomfortable with, but I have never claimed to be a fan of card games.  The thing is, I will play the game and there is a degree of consistancy to the people who win.  Personally I would recommend Kahuna as a card game before this.  But would not tell people not to buy this game.  It really does seem expensive for a pack of cards and 9 non-descript playing pieces.

One of the all time great two play games, this plays very similarly to Lost Cities, but with a good deal more strategic depth.  The theme is pasted on, the production has a very cheap feel, but the "just one more card before I commit" hand management gameplay will keep you coming back for more time and again.

A great 2 player game! The formations take away some of the luck of the draw involved in every game that you get to draw cards at random from a commom deck.

The game has much more strategy than I anticipated: sure, you can predict if you are going to get a particular card, but you can work with the odds: after all, you have 50% chance to get the card you need.

I also was surprise to see that I can see theme in this mostly abstract game. A really nice thing, for me.

My favourite cardgame for two. Great mixture of tension, deduction, strategy, and luck. All of this in just 30 min!!. I like tactic cards. I think they help to mitigate unlucky draws and adds some more variety and strategy in spite of a bit more chaotic game IMO. 7 card hands and 10s make a more foreseeable and easier to get big hands than Schotten Totten. But you can leave out 10s and play 6 card hands if you want a bit harder game (like Sch-Tott) with less wedges. I like play both ways.

I love games that are small, compact, and easy to pull out and set up, but still give me an intriguing strategical challenge.  This game scratches that itch perfectly.  In just a deck of cards and some pawns, this game manages to offer an extremely deep and satisfying two-player game experience.  Sometimes I'd rather play without the tactics cards, because they can swing the game in drastic ways and some are clearly better than others (and what you get is totally random).

Another favorite Reiner K. 2-player card game with a poker twist.  Timing is everything in this game: knowing when to hold out and start a new battle, which flags to attack and when.

My distaste for this game was probably derived more from lack of good two-player partners than from the game itself. Mechanically sound, with moments of tension as you wait and hope for "that card you need", it still couldn't overcome a playing partner that lacked the trash-talking gene.

Love the strategy and it's another good game to take to dinner.  The only real downside is that it can take up a bit more table space at a restaurant than is convenient.  The tactics cards are a good addition to throw a wrench in your opponent's plans.

Interesting decision making, but the pasted-on theme is completely silly.  Your light infantry, skirmisher, and peltast beat my heavy infantry, phalanx, and elephant because yours are the same color and mine aren't?  Ooooookay....  Google for "Hoplites" to see a plausible ancient warfare cardgame, and treat this as an intellectual puzzle and everything is fine.

01/11/14 - Upgraded from a 7 to 8. This is definitely an 8.
06/05/15 - Down to 7. Haven't played this one in a while.
26/09/15 - Back up to 8. 

This game has spawned so many derivatives. It's the original and still the king.

Even without the additional cards, it's still absolutely fantastic.

For just a little more complexity than Lost Cities, I think you get a whole lot more game here.  I also like the event cards.  If you don't like them leave them alot, but I like a little unpredictability.  I may not like it when it happens, but I like it when things get shaken up.  I also like the fact that they are kept under control by having a limit on how many you can play.  BTW:  I had heard that the cards were thin and cheap, but OH MY GOD!

This game is a real brain burner if you take your time to really think about what's going on. It's like trying to play 9 hands of poker all at the same time! Wow!

An IMPORTANT side note, these are the STIFFEST playing cards I've ever played with! We have almost 200 games, so I don't have a small sample size here. I literally tried "breaking them in" for almost an hour! Even after that...it's still like trying to shuffle boards! Simply TERRIBLE quality!

Wonderful, tense, agonizing game. Has the same sort of feel as Lost Cities but seems like you have much greater control. I like it with and without the tactics cards, depending on mood.

Battle Line is pretty bland in my opinion. It is just a generic card game with a theme, that doesn't make a lot of sense, strapped onto it. I don't see what all of the hype is about. Maybe there is more strategy to it than I realized, but it really wasn't that exciting.

While not the best 2-player card game (as I've read by some), it's definitely a lot of fun to play and provides plenty of strategy.  However, it feels like some of the tactics cards are stronger than others which then turns the strategy element into mere luck.

RATING: 7.6
Tense game for two. Very psychological in a way that is similar to poker. Poor card quality: stiff, carboard-style cards that are difficult to shuffle. My wife and I play, and she doesn't like wasting an opportunity to pick up a number card that I might benefit from, so I end up only playing 1 tactic card (because I can have played only 1 more than my opponent at any time). Extremely confrontational, which lead to some not-so fun moments with the wife :P. The theme is simple yet relevant. Once my wife and I played this game, Lost Cities never came back to the table. Overall, a game that is much deeper than it looks, and one that can be whipped out and set up in very little time.

Battle Line is a deceptively simple card game that plays in about 15 minutes. It is akin to playing nine separate but concurrent three card poker hands. Players vie for five "flags" (or three in a row) to win the game. The "Tactics" cards add variety and new challenges. Battle Line is easy to teach and fun to play.

Great game!  Every game is full of interesting decisions and plays to completion in half an hour or so.  The rule that you can only ever play one more tactics card than your opponent is one that we overlooked for a while, but which is absolutely essential to keep the game from being dominated by the luck-of-the-draw in the tactics deck.  With that rule, this is really a good two-player game.

Maybe I haven't played this enough, or with the right people, but I wasn't too amazed with this game.  It's a nice card game variation, has some strategy... ultimately I think what kills it for me is that it feels like it should have more strategy to it, but it's far more luck dependent.

The first half of the game is just guessing at what you might have available later on.  The last 5 minutes are a lot of fun trying to solve a puzzle, but it also can be very frustrating as you have to make concessions with all your plans gone awry.

I hate [gameid=50].  I hate [gameid=15878].  This game is a combination of the two.  It's better than both of them, but the best of two piles of suck is still mostly suck.  Has a pretty large luck element, like its forbears.  The battle theming is mostly awkwardly jiggered on, but there are some nods to principles of ancient warfare.  The center is important, and it is also good to have troops with at least a modicum of organization and cohesion.  Still, I don't really feel like I'm a general, I feel like I'm playing Rummy.  Or Lost Cities.  Which both suck.  Ehhhh, you get the point.

I've never played the game with the action cards, but they seem too chaotic and random to add to such an elegant, tense game.  I've heard that some people will play that each person gets one "Replace a card with another card" action per game, which would help alleviate some of the initial layout that's done without a clear idea of how the sets will develop, and I like the idea.  I've never played this way, though, so my rating for Battle Line is lower than that for Schotten Totten.

Clever and quite engaging little game! Battle Line has simple rules, plays quick, and travels well. I don't consider this a "wargame". You play "poker hands" against opponent to claim flags.

Reminds me of Balloon Cup (I think Battle Line came first), but with more options. Compete to capture 5 of 9 flags (or 3 adjacent ones) by assembling a higher 3-card hand (think standard straight flush, 3-of-a-kind, flush, straight, everything else) than your opponent for each flag. Tactics cards introduce some special plays. Very fun!

Battle Line is a two-player card game built around the theme of warfare during the age of Alexander the Great. Battle Line features 60 full-color Rodger MacGowan/Mark Simonitch cards depicting the prominent formations of the period (War Elephants, Heavy Cavalry, Phalanx, etc.) and 10 full-color tactics "wildcards" that give players extra flexibility and choices and help make each new battle wildly different from the last.
\13\ \13\ 
To win, you must create powerful formations along your side of the line of battle that are superior to those of your enemy. Victory goes to the player who wins 5 of the 9 battle flags (an envelopment) or three adjacent flags (a breakthrough). Based on Reiner Knizia's original design published in Germany as Shotten-Totten, Battle Line enhances and expands that game system to give players even more tactical options and gut-wrenching decisions.
\13\ \13\ 
How will you muster your battle line? Will you use your elephants to trample a hole in the enemy front, or send Alexander to the front to win a critical flag? Maybe you'll dispatch the Companion cavalry to lead or reinforce a crucial point in the line, or perhaps you"ll rely on your spies to determine the enemy"s strengths and weaknesses before committing your best forces. You'll always have plenty of choices. With every card play, you'll determine the strength and direction of your attack while plotting to fend off your enemy's advances.

Two players build 9 different competing poker hands simultaneously, by alternating turns playing one card at a time. It's incredibly simple, yet strategically complex as you try to bluff your opponent into over committing at the locations of your bad hands. The theme is completely tacked on, but the slow build up and push and pull of the various hand strengths does end up looking kind of like an ancient Battleline...so well played, Dr. Knizia.

9/27/17: Finally got a chance to play.  It's a good game for sure.  Lots of agonizing choices with each card play.  Very similar to Lost Cities, but I might enjoy this a tad bit more.  We typically play w/o the tactics cards.

It has all the tense play of Lost Cities - shall I play my card now or can I afford to wait?, not showing your hand to opponent too early, being forced to play a card before you really wanted, etc etc - but it there is more to it. Not being able to discard - ouch. So simple but genious.

Good game which feels similar to lost cities in which players compete for the flag in the middle. Very tactical and alot of ways to attempt to use your hands&#039; &#039;bad&#039; cards to your advantage. 
Play game without the tactical cards makes game more balanced. It is abit of a brain burner at times to &quot;prove&quot; the values so do not underestimate it as very light game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a pretty neat 2-player game that relies heavily on card-counting. It is all about strategically playing your cards based on which other cards you see on the table. While its almost total reliance on deck-memorization isn't quite to my style, I can see why this game is so well-loved. It has an incredibly solid design and appeals to a very Chess-like strategic thinking.

After many games with only troops cards, i played a couple of games with tactics cards and i enjoyed it a lot. Yes, it is less elegant and polished, but it's also exciting and surprising and a lot more fantasy is required. I will definitely alternate the two gaming variants

RATING: 7
I gave this game the short shrift before because I had only played it on iOS. There's a tiny rule change there that reduces your hand size for the basic/beginner game that really reduces your flexibility and doesn't change an awful lot, so if you're trying it out on iOS, go straight to the advanced game.

Here are the basics if you haven’t played before: you have nine flags that represent lanes or columns of troops. You have a hand of seven cards. There are sixty cards of six colors/suits that are numbered 1 to 10. You’re attempting to build three card combinations that resemble poker hands: suited straights, three-of-a-kinds, straights, flushes, then “hosts” which is just a sum. At the end of your turn (or beginning if you’re playing the advanced rules) you can claim one flag. The first person to claim three adjacent flags or five non-adjacent flags wins.

This feels like a superior version of Lost Cities, a game my wife and I used to play a good bit, but I’m not sure why that is. It’s still a game of numbers, but Battle Line feels like it somewhat mimics the feel of a battle. You need to be careful about overcommitting and misinterpreting your opponent’s actions.

If there’s any cons about the game is that it is ultimately a deck of cards and some pawns. There’s not much here, but frankly the rules get out of the way of the game and it’s just more portable for being what it is. If this was Kickstarted today you could expect plastic molded flags, a playmat, and foil cards with full-bleed art.

Definitely worth the purchase.

Played best of 5 games (without the tactics cards), and it was close. Great fun, very tense. Perfect for non-gamers with or without card playing experience.

Update: my go to game for non gamers when there are just two of you. Brilliant, with or without the tactic cards.

Update 2014-03: None too keen on the tactics cards. They prolong and confuse a simple and elegant game.

Update 2014-06: There's a three player variant?! Must give that a go, although "Knights of Charlemagne" seems a better option..?

My BF explained this to me but I forgot what he said- that it's an easy game to explain/understand/play but hard to play well? In any case, however he phrased it, I agree entirely. I have a lot of fun playing this game, it involves randomness and chance (which I like) but strategy that is stimulating enough to be difficult and engaging. It's not a silly fun game but it's not one that hurts my brain either. Relatively quick. Overall, I love it, it's exactly at my level and the perfect mix of random/strategy. Two thumbs way up!

Two player majority control card game. The battle line consists of a row of 9 flag markers. Play a card/Draw a card to build 3-card poker hands in front of each flag for control. Highest hand takes the flag, majority of flags wins.  I respect the purist view but...  For me the tactics cards are the crux of play with back-and-forth manipulation of the formations. For traveling/camping, just take the deck of cards an add nine proxy flag cards.

This is a fantastic game. You end up making some agonizing decisions that are typical of a much longer game. The luck of the draw can swing some games but the game is so short it's not a big deal. We rarely play one game when we break this out, it's almost always best of three and that takes 20-40 minutes. I can't see ever turning down a game of this and I'm always up for it. Even my wife enjoys the game. The components are all great quality. The theme is a little pasted on but who cares, it's an outstanding game. The tactics cards and ability to win by taking three in a row add a whole new level of complexity. Fantastic game, it's probably the best bang for $15 you will ever find.

I sheepishly admit that a pure numbers game can be made better by introducing combat and battle formations.

I find the game's logical analysis intriguing, in which players can argue (based on what is visible) that it's impossible for the opponent to win a particular flag - and therefore they can immediately take the flag themselves.

The Tactics cards add some serious swing to the game, compared to [thing=372]Schotten-Totten[/thing], but I'm not sure that swing is a good thing.  It makes Battle Line feel more exciting, but the elegance of the "tactics"-free "battles" in [thing=372]Schotten-Totten[/thing] is also overshadowed.  On the other hand, rather than just numbly drawing at the end of your turn, you must make a tough decision about which deck you will trust to give you something useful; made more interesting by the spiteful uses for most of the tactics cards.  All in all, fun, with a short time requirement.

Another fine 2-player game. I'm starting to have a good collection of these for the days when only one of game crew can show up. Nice and fast with just enough thinking to make it interesting. Definite keeper.

Enjoy the game, though it just feels a touch stale now. Should probably try it with the tactics cards and the terrain expansion. UPDATE Having played with the tactics cards does improve the variability in the game, and they do make the game more exciting. Terrain cards are a good addition, rules are clear.

Nice two player game.  I think it is kind of like Lost Cities, where you have to plan your card plays and hope you get some other cards you need.

After 1 Play: I was pleasantly surprised by this.  After one play it is on my buy list.

After 10+ Plays: One of my favorite 2-player games.  I usually leave out the special cards, as I think they ruin the brilliant simplicity of the system.

Zip setup time, 10-15 minutes per game. Works well on so many levels. Excellent!

A great little game that's light on rules but tough with decisions... especially ramping up towards the end.

A fun quick game.  I like poker and, yeah, the theme is REALLY thin, but it's a nice quick 2 player game.

Played one game with my wife. Neither of us were greatly impressed. Felt a little dry. I think it'll improve with plays but that first game just didn't grab.

one of the best 2-player games. good "painful" decisions for each play, tactics cards add just enough "fiddling" to the original Schotten-Totten concept.

Have played this at least 200-300 times with my wife. Excellent game with a short playing time.

An abstract and not too interesting, but two player games with even this much entertainment are quite rare anyway.

An excellent card game for 2 that is simple, clean, and has a nice balance between tactics, strategy and luck.

A two player only card game of ancient armies facing off in a pitched battle. Each player plays one card per turn against any one of nine objectives, the aim is to build up three card sets that beat each other like poker hand e.g. three cards all the same number (three of a kind) beats three all the same colours (a flush). Despite having very few rules the game is surprisingly tactical and difficult with a host of hard decisions on every turn.

Theme: Ancient armies
Mechanic: Set building, area control
Ideal players: 2 only
Length: Short

2-player solitaire with some sort of conflict. Poker on steroids boosted by designer's talent. Should play this with money-stakes one day.

il s'agit d'un jeu de cartes; les joueurs tentent de défoncer les lignes ennemies en faisant des combinaisons de style poker avec les cartes qui leur sont distribuées; hasard et stratégie sont bien balancés; un peu abstrait mais vraiment plaisant

Awesome dexterity game.  Played it with kids ranging from aged 3 to aged 10 and the cards make it possible to have a pretty balanced game (ignoring the points values and picking the cards for the player).

Played this with my 11, 8 and 5 year old and I was really surprised how fun it was! We used the timer's #3 for the 5 year old, the #2 for the 8 and 11 year old and I as the parent used the #1 and it really balanced things out. Kids loved it. Definitely a keeper.

04+ or 08+, 2-4 players, not best with any, 30 mins. Played with 4 year old by using simpler cards but the variation in skills is too great. Need to give more skillful players a (significant) handicap. The play is quite different to Make'n'Break Junior.

The only thing for us is that the no-battery timer doesn't work very well. We have to make sure someone is watching the timer and keeping it going.

This is a fine filler game that my five-year old daughter can play with me. She gets 3 on the timer and I get 1. Also she is allowed to pass 3-difficulty cards to me for my next turn.  This works pretty well and I believe the game is good for her spatial intelligence, efficient manipulation and counting (scores). Recommended for playing with kids or maybe as a filler with adults though I haven't tried this.

I normally don't like dexterity games but this was fun for a while. That its really about pattern recognition and visualisation rather than dexterity probably helps for me. The randomness of getting 1,2 or 3 for your time allocation takes away from the skill required to win unless you play multiple rounds, but its not worthy of that large a time investment.
Fun party game, but out stays its welcome after a turn or two each.

Incredibly simple, and fun, dexterity game.  Players on their turn flip over a puzzle card, which represents who to stack up to a dozen chunky wooden pieces in order to proceed to the next puzzle.  Players have a set amount of time to solve the puzzle.  Puzzles are graded in difficulty, so more points are earned for solving the tricky puzzles (but they take more time!).  Plays in around fifteen minutes, and is totally addictive.

A puzzle game similar to Katamino, but with only rectangle blocks, not blocks of different shapes.  

This quality game has colorful, well painted, large blocks.  Before the timer runs out players have to duplicate the block arrangement shown on a card.

This is also a game of dexterity when duplicating the pattern in a tower.  This game is rated for 8+ year olds, so for younger children we eliminate the timer, and build the pattern flat on the table.  

It's a good educational game for children younger than 8, even though it is not suggested for young children.  My only interest is in playing it with children--otherwise will always play Pueblo or Rumis + instead, which are somewhat similar.

Seems simplistic at first and it is.  But there's a time pressure that makes it great for small parties.  The large blocks are pretty drunk friendly and the clatter of blocks when you break down the structures just makes the game feel so energetic.  It's not without its flaws, as a team that rolls poorly can get shafted pretty hard.

It's not as fun as it feels like it could have been, if that's making any sense. A bit too easy I think, at least for adults, and small kids on the contrary are having a bit of trouble with it, so I don't find it great as a family game. Probably fun while drunk but, you know, meh.

It's more an exercise in hand-eye coordination than a real game(there is no player interaction), but we always have lots of fun playing it. It's an 'in between games'-game. 

The 'random' time you get alloted is something I wouldn't use though. Add an option were the other players can choose which card you must use and you have a lot more interaction.

Rather boring for adults. I'll keep it to play with my daughter without the timer.

Update: My daughter (3.5 years) enjoys it. She can do difficulty levels one and two. She gets a kick out of separating the threes and giving them all to me. She particularly likes knocking her structures over when she's done.

Dexterity pattern recognition game similar to Pack & Stack.  You have 10 identical size (but different colour) blocks that you must stack in precise order.  Create as many sets as possible before your time runs out.  Most points win.  Simple with lots of laughs.  You only get through 5 cards or so even on the long timer.  Hardened gamers like this.

RATING: 7.3
Jun08: Quite a good bargain I got in picking both of these up on the cheap.  I've tried the regular and extreme versions, and I just don't know if I like one better or not.

The large chunky blocks in this one give a very satisfying feel to building things.  I'm definitely color dyslexic however.  I just can't get those lined up right.

I'm not a fan of the die.  I just used the included variant of playing three rounds on the 3 then the 2 then the 1 of the timer.  This worked out just fine to me and still the cards allowed variation in scoring chances.

Really, this game is just a lot of fun.  And that's the point isn't it?


Extreme Version:

Jun08: Well, I can't really tell which M'n'B I like better.  I picked them both up though, so maybe I'll just combine them to do up to 6ish players at once.

The actual game is a combination of speed and dexterity.  The extreme version changes to hard plastic pieces of tetris shapes.

They also included some odd cards that just require you to use so many pieces and only have 2 touch the ground.  I wasn't impressed and went ahead and yanked them.

It's an enjoyable game of stacking and stress.

I like the combination of speed and dexterity, and the game is so simple to learn.  While playing it feels kind of like Time Is Money without having to keep track of time.  The blocks are nice and big and easy to manipulate.  It's fun to actually break down each structure as you go.  They range from ridiculously easy to moderately challenging.  This is a unique game that goes over well with just about anyone.  My one complaint is the die.  I don't see why you just don't do away with it, as it is a ridiculous randomizer that doesn't really make sense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice little dexterity filler. Players use blocks to build certain shapes as quickly as possible. Its certainly fun for a while, but I can't see it having much replayability.

Some variability in the shapes of the blocks would've been nice, since all the blocks are exactly the same shape and size.

童心に戻ってプレイするアクション系ゲームの傑作のひとつ。5歳前から息子もプレイしているが、最初はタイマーで焦らされるのが嫌いなようだった。6歳でようやく正式ルールにデビューした。
大人の間では、スティッキーが好きな人はこのゲームも好きなようだ。
欠点は値段が高い点。あと、木を使用しているのは良いが、もう少し重量感があった方が好みだ。この積み木は軽すぎる。
拡張がでているが、形状を変えるのではなく三面図から組み立てるシステムの方が教育的にはいいかな。また、カードの追加があっても良かったのではないかと思う。いいゲームだけに残念。

Fun, pressure filled dexterity game in which you seek to build structures with up to 10 unique colored rectangular blocks.  Some of the 3 point structures for adults are really quite tricky to build.  Replay value my diminish over time if played consistently as there are only 40 or so different structures to build.

For something different if you want 6-8 to be able to play, have teams of two try to build a structure and watch the hilarity as they try to work "together"!

(Requires 4 sets)
4 teams of 2 sitting opposite each other at a circular table. Each team has a stack of cards. At sound of buzzer they simultaneously start by turning over one card. "A" can see the card, but only "B" can say touch the pieces. 

2 variations of play:
(a) "A" can only use words (no hand motions) to communicated to "B" what needs to be done
(b) "A" can only use hand signals, but no words, to communicate to "B" what needs to be done.
(b1) "A" can use caveman-like words similar to Argh-tech game.

I think this one is a lot harder than "Extreme", some of the stacks are just brutal. We always play without the die rolling and just do 3 rounds of descending time.

I'd say the biggest fault is the somewhat unbalancing nature of the difficultly vs time rewards on some of the 3 point cards. It's usually easier to knock out 2 or 3 "2 pointers" than to finish some of the red 3's.

Very enjoyable dexterity game with an 'easy' option if playing with children or new players. A good self-sustaining game for game nights - each group teaches the next group.

Don't bother with the cheesy cardboard coins though - a piece of paper & a pencil is easier!

Rating upped from 7.5 to 9 in 2016 because longevity. We still take this to gaming events, still play it, everyone enjoys it. I considered giving it a '10'.

Fun dexterity party game.  It's true that some of the 3 point cards are much harder than others, put playing with the advanced variant (where you can pass unwanted cards to the person on your left) helps balance this.  Some of the colors are a little hard to distinguish, but for the most part the components are top notch.  Picked up at a thrift store for $4.50.

RATING: 7
I've rated this game in terms of its appeal as a family game.  My wife, and boys absolutely love to play this game.  I will never suggest it to my Friday evening gaming group.  As a family game, however, it works great.  In terms of developing skills, it obviously promotes spacial relations awareness.  For my boys, I love using this game to teach them the importance of remaining calm under pressure.  There is just something about the sound of that timer that causes them to get tense and make mistakes they otherwise wouldn't.  While I value the learning opportunities this game provides for my children, the truth is that it is also just a lot of fun.

RATING: 5
A speed game that entails constructing with blocks the shape that the revealed card says, with the colours in the right places. This is definitely fun with the kids, and you can tailor the difficulty levels to match things up between age groups. The downside is that there really is absolutely nothing to do when it's not your turn except watch, except maybe in the compact version when one person rolls a die continually as a countdown simulator.

My rating is based on the publisher's statement of it being a family game. The game idea is neat, but the game is too easy/luck denpendet for adults, so it becomes uninteresting - alas my rating. If, on the other hand, it were to be judged as a children's game - voila! - add another 2-3 points...

Fun speed dexterity game, best played with beer or kids.  The basic concept is good, though the random turn length is gratuitous and annoying.  The difficult cards could be made harder as collapses of partially-built structures are disappointingly rare.  Good fun for the occasional play.

Nice dexterity game for family with kids...

Our houserules to make the game also more suitable for kids+parents game: 
- We play that adults cannot build while building card is face up. You have to stop building to look at your building card and then put it down facedown to build again.
- You can discard your card for 5 second penalty (everybody is counting) or Once per game)
- If you make a mistake, penalty 5 seconds and then it is possible to repair
- usually 3 rounds (possible more/less)

This underrated Ravensburger kids' game makes a great dexterity / party game for grown-ups. Everything is very well executed: great components, separate decks of cards for kids and adults, and a childproof timer. I can't praise this highly enough.

I'd play without the dice, though: just set an appropriate time for each player, as a handicap (e.g. kids get the maximum time). Or you could use Shawn Low's excellent suggestion and just roll the die once per round, applying the same time limit to everyone's turns.

Update: after more play, this is now one of my favourites, and certainly the best dex game out there.

Glad to see this game getting good comments. Early feedback wasn't so good so I held off buying it. But it looks like fun and I'll cave soon.

Update: The components are as solid and colourful as the gameplay. Each turn, players turn over cards and have to use the wooden blocks to construct the structure before the buzzer goes. Each card has different points (1 to 3) depending on the complexity of the structure.

After 4 rounds, points are tabulated and the player with the highest score wins! It's tense and provides lots of laughs. The components are lovely to behold!

Dexterity game of using 10 coloured blocks to match the patterns on the cards.

Can see the whole family enjoying this one. Can get a little frantic towards the end of your building time.

Dice NOT needed. Just give everyone 3 rounds with the timer at 1, 2 and 3.

I play a lot with kids so I am constantly seeking out games that are both great for kids and good to great with adults. 

This one is that. In fact, a version with more blocks and trickier structures would have a nice grown-up audience.

As it is, this in a pretty good drinking game.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1.25

I enjoyed this action-packed game very very much. Some people act very quickly but often make mistakes and collapses. Some people are slow players but they can beat the quick ones unobviously. Kids like playing it. Adults too. Once played with colleagues. Though the box states it for 4 players, we had fun with 7 players in office. Playing with more causes more downtime though.

Playing with 4 is just right, one playing, one timing, one flipping cards, one judging.

Playing with the dice (as in original rules) delivers better party moods. I find myself no complain about the dice. It's actually a good tweak.

I have yet to play this with a non-gamer who hasn't purchased it for themselves within a month. Whenever we have friends over who "hate" games, I force them to play this. They moan and wail until the nice, heavy building blocks get on the table and suddenly the hater-whine ceases as they,  totally immersed now, start stacking. Wind up the timer and they are hooked-- "let's play again" they scream over and over. (Skip rolling the die as others have said.) When we have friends over who have kids we pull it out too. Kids love this game! Despite this tale of success, it isn't a "gateway" game: the moans will crank right back up when you pull out Settlers. Lastly, I have yet to play it as filler with a real game group but imagine it won't be greeted with similiar cheers. Nevertheless, if I had to pick a "party game" I'd skip apples-to-apples (*urp* that is the sound of me throwing up a little in my mouth at the thought of playing apples-to-apples) and I'd pull this out. And, I am quite happy to have it on the shelf for those "just right" non-gamer, party game occasions.

Wow. Great game blending visual acuity with manual dexterity. Flip a card, build the figure as quickly as you can with the blocks - and get as many different structures built as you can before time expires. Scales fairly well for adults and kids by having cards with more difficult structures. Nice components, fun game.

just playing Marvel on Marvel is a little boring. As many others have said, it's pretty much a slugfest with the best dice rolls winning. 
however, mixing the marvel characters in with the regular characters is pretty fun, though they're a bit powerful.

Heroscape with a Marvel Comics license. The only negative point is that the game does not include enough characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun addition to the heroscape universe.  The figures are completely compatible with the base game, and you can stage games of "many common squads vs 1-2 supers".  I think some of the characters are overly powerful, but this is mostly reflected in their point cost.  I picked this up as my heroscape interest was waning, so it didn't get much play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The heros fit well with the rest of the heroscape line, but some of the powers don't quite go with my recolation of the comics.  I can't wait to run Captian America into a bunch of melle orcs.

The heros are silly expensive and silly good. Turns from a squad based action fun game to a superhero dicefest. Which is fun occasionally, but I prefer the regular game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Bought this cheap, was interesting to see a new take on Heroscape, but the system doesn't seem to suit armies on a smaller board with no squads as much as it suits the Rise of the Valkyrie setup.

Traded away.

Awesome Set!
The scenarios are a lot of fun and play faster than the master set.
This is ideal to get the HeroScape experience in a shorter time and with awesome figures!

Fun way to get into the Marvel Universe, but lack of product follow up (to this point) hurts as you quickly want to play other scenarios. Lots of customs out there, but it would be nice if something official was put out there to support the game.

Bumped it up to an 8 due to the ease in making customs, resulting in now having all the characters that I hoped would have been officially released.

Wow! A Heroscape game with licensed Marvel superheroes! I admit: I'm not a comics guy. But I'm leaning to get this just to pull the terrain into Heroscape. Jan. 2007 release date? We'll see! UPDATE: Mid-April and no release in sight. Rumors are for (end of?) May. Considering the summer release of Spiderman 3 (meh) I reckon it'll coincide with that. Hope it does well so we can, perhaps, see some other franchises explored.UPDATE: Mid-July and a few online retailers and FLGSs have it. My FLGS, which had it on pre-order, didn't get a copy.UPDATE: Mid-August. Finally purchased!...So when yer buddy sez, "Dude! It's due in January!" you can tell 'em, "Dude! I'll see ya in August!"

If you mix Heroscape Marvel with any of the regular Heroscape figs in scenarios, go easy. One or two Marvel characters go a looong way.

Streamlined version of the other master sets.  I am bummed that it isn't such a toybox of great figures/terrain like the original game set.  But I do like the quick setup time with the terrain.  You can get playing a lot faster IMO but the scenarios are not quite as engaging.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great game, simple rules.  Love the simplicity of this system and the way the special powers manage to capture the essence of the theme.  Great fun!

There may not be much terrain in the base box, I bought two as they can be found quite cheaply, it is worth it - I am also looking at using this game at school, the kids would be wild about a game that is about this subject let alone a game that looks the way this one looks.

The simplicity of the game is a real bonus, everything in the game, fom moving up, fighting and special powers are all logically handled within this simple framework.

The role of dice in this game is profound, if you are the sort of player who is turned off by a significant amount of luck then this is a game that you would be better off avoiding, however, if you can live with this strong element of luck this game is thematic and a rollicking adventure.  The best part is it doesn't outstay it's welcome.

It definitely needs more stuff (figures, terrain, etc.) to be a worthy replacement to HeroScape. In my first game, Captain America and Iron Man both died in the second round leaving Spiderman to avoid Abomination; he didn't have a prayer.

My least favorite Master Set. Not to say it is bad, but not visually what I was looking for. The new concrete and asphalt tiles add no new rules and visually do not seem to work well with the other terrain. The building with destructible wall is nice, though it is typically easier to just go around than waste a turn destroying. I do LOVE the figures. My group allows Marvel to play with any other Heroscape army. When someone grabs Silver Surfer, it's on! The new heroes may seem overpowered, but I've seen 'em go down mightily to an ambushing squad.  Get for Marvel figures, not more terrain.

I've played Heroscape once and liked it, however never really got into it.  The Time Bandits theme didn't work for me (eventhough I like the movie).  
This however is awesome.  Perfect for 45min to hour dice rolling slugfest.  Needs more terrain, though.  That means I'll have to break down and get some Heroscape stuff for additional terrain and squads to work as minions for Doom and Red Skull.
Bring on the expansions.

It is ok on its own, but would be really good with the full Heroscape game.

RATING: 5
I owned the original Heroscape set, and enjoyed playing it (although eventually got rid of it).  I thought the more limited number of units and the tie-in to comic heroes would be a big plus, but I was disappointed.

One issue is that the terrain/maps are small and don't allow for the use of much tactics. Most of the units fight about the same. This could be alleviated in part by having more terrain and a bigger map.

I had hoped my 7 year old son would be able to play and enjoy himself, but I found we were both getting bored with this one. He didn't have enough interesting choices and the dice circumvented what few he did have. In some cases the dice can help balance the skill differential in a game like this, but in our case even he was getting sick of it.

RATING: 5
I do not have the terrain for this set so I am simply rating the figures. The Marvel master set includes 8 super heroes and villains from the Marvel universe. Most of these figures are really powerful and cost a lot of points (Hulk alone is 370 points). I have not yet played enough Heroscape to really say how they affect the game, but for now they seem a bit overpowered and I feel like I might want to play without them. We'll see how this changes when I play more.

We just got this for Christmas 2007. Looks awesome! Will rate once we get it out from under the tree and onto our battle-table!

Update (12/20/2008): We've played with the superheroes a couple of times now, in conjunction with our normal HS figures in some home-brewed scenarios. I like them - they are quite powerful, but often considerably outnumbered by normal squad figures. A nice addition to the system - I hope they do eventually come out with some expansion figures.

I nice addition to the core system, but I think the basic Heroscape set provides more bang for the buck. My favorite thing about the addition of superheroes is pitting them against the normal figures in the basic set. Sometimes the balance is a little off, but it's not that big of an issue. Why can Krug beat The Hulk, a 370 point unit?!?  Grrr...

RATING: 7
Brain-dead "beat-'em-up" that gets a lot of mileage from its cool components and fast and simple rules.  I would have rated this higher if it had been expanded to include more Marvel Universe heroes, villains, goons and terrain. As it stands right now it's just a pretty but vacant slug-fest.

This was the first HeroScape game we tried.  We started with the basic rules, which were fun, but I really liked the game when we played the Master rules.  I am now hooked on the HeroScape system. 

Great entry for HeroScape in the Marvel system.  My only complaint is that they didn't support it beyond this one.

Shameful how little comes in the box compared to the original starter set at the same retail price.  But the heroes are well done and the battles play out in a fun way.   The characters here are so much more interesting than the starter characters, so it's a double-edged sword overall.

This is by far the cheapest "master set" you can buy for heroscape. It comes with a decent amount of tiles and 10 really cool marvel super heroes/villains. I have seen the gripes about how these characters are over powered and don't mix well with the heroscape universe. Well, to be honest, I'm a purist, so when I play Marvel, I use only Marvel characters, so that's not an issue for me. The only big thing to realize when buying any heroscape set is that, chances are, you wont be happy with just one set because no matter how many ways you build it or change it, it will always feel limited, and Wizards of the Coasts have officially abandoned this line, so there likely will be no expansions or addons of ANY kind for this product, unless someone else buys it. So just beware when you buy that you will likely be mixing it with other heroscape lines, or making/buying custom tiles/armies to expand this product.

Played alone the figures are fun to play but the board is too small. Played with regular Heroscape the board is huge but the figures overpower the regulars. The point balance given to each figure is accurate, with exception to The Hulk, but it’s not useful or fun to play with Common figures. That, combined with the star power of the Marvel characters, throws Heroscape off balance. 

Too bad nothing really happened to add to Marvel Heroscape.

08/29/07Review forthcoming.  Please note I actually think very highly of this set and what it brings to the game but I am dinging it points based solely on "straight out of the box" playability.  I'm waffling on this right now so I might change my mind.  It's like...this is a "10" in terms of the kind of stuff I want in Heroscape.  Bar none, this is COOL stuff, right up my alley, absolutely.  But I have to balance that with the tiny, tiny amount of terrain in this set.  My six-year old was actually *bored* with the small map (as all we really did was stand around and blast each other repeatedly...with high movement and large ranges, there was little incentive to move and nowhere to hide even if we wanted to).

If it gets pulled out, It's mainly so my son can play briefly with the figures.  It's ok, but nothing that grabs me (29/12/10). UPDATE: Still not convinced, but will still give it a go (rating 5 - 8/1/12). UPDATE The heroes are too powerful to combine with a normal game of Heroscape (Rating 5.132 Jan 17)

I used to love to play this with a buddy of mine. I bought lots more terrain and even some regular Heroscape minis that fit thematically (Hulk stomp attack versus army troopers anyone?). Then my buddy moved away. Now I basically have no one to play with. Plus, it would be great to have a dedicated gaming table to leave a nicely built map set up and ready to go. What a shame Hasbro never got to release even the first expansion. I bought some sand terrain in case Sandman got any kind of bonuses or abilities while on sand. I would like to play this again sometime but am not looking forward to all of the setup involved with building the map.

The beginning master set seems a bit limited but that may be due to the fact that we have TONS of original heroscape stuff. It appears the figures (as is) may be incompatible with original as the specs seem higher (attacks and defends) I'm interested in seeing where they take this franchise.

I like the sculpts and abilities of the characters, but there are two problems with this set. The game is lacking in characters (only 10) and terrain (although this won't be a problem for people that have a different Master Set). Due to the lack of superheroes, I end up mixing them with Classic Heroscape. If the Marvel expansions ever arrive I think all-Marvel games would be much better.

This game has dropped some for me in rating but i do still like it, it just really needs the right group and don't have that i guess.

I like it better than standard Heroscape, largely because I've never cared for Heroscape's characters or setting.

Let me preface this by saying that if I had not played heroscape first, this one might have been rated a little higher. It's not that this game is bad. How could it be? I have Heroscape rated a 10. The problem is, by comparison this game is bland. Superheros interest me less than fantasy and sci-fi anyway, but add that to the fact that it comes with very little terrain, is really only for two players, has no squads, etc. and you are better off playing the original.

I was apprehensive about getting this game because I did not really like the original. Having more hit points and abilities that relate to known heroes or villian make the game for me. The one point heroscape figures from the original game made the game too one sided at times with barely enough time to build a strategy. 

This game now belongs to my seven year old son. He designs his own little games with it. The heroscape board is almost as wonderful as legos.

They got the rules for the powers just right in this one—each hero and villain feels exactly like they should.  Captain America can richochet his adamantium shield off of multiple heads; Spider-Man is next to impossible to pin down; the Hulk gets stronger as he gets madder.  (It felt *perfect* to have him roll 12 (!) attack dice in the last round before he got knocked out:  6 for being the Hulk, plus 5 for being enraged, plus 1 for standing next to Cap.  I swear the Abomination got knocked all the way into next month's issue...  [b]KRAKA-[i]THOOOM!!![/i][/b])

Marvel heroscape, it's a lot of fun, and can mix with heroscape, but not "officially".  They don't give much terrain, and the monocolor black and grey tiles look pretty bland, but where else can you play with prepainted marvel minis?  (*sarcastically ignores heroclix*)  Worth it for fans of the heroscape system and for people looking for marvel minis that is easy to learn, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

Huge Huge Huge fan of HeroScape. It's awesome that its kept alive by heroscapers.com with tons of comic book characters. Finally I can have fun with all my HeroClix minis. You can even play with them on square heroclix maps instead of the huge plastic hex plates. The game is simple, so you can easily teach it to friends. This is epitome of what makes Ameritrash awesome!

Heroscape with Super Heroes.  What's not to love?

Heroes balance well against each other.  From a game perspective, the super's point values and powers balance them against other pieces in the larger Heroscape universe, but sometimes they feel underpowered for what your sense of superheroes ought to be able to do.  Iron Man taken out by a squad of zombies?  Really?  Thematically, you'd want Iron Man to cut through the zombies effortlessly, but to preserve game balance, it makes sense to have the powers the way they are.  (I'm not suggesting a change.)

Initial Rating 8.5 (September 2010)

I love Heroscape and I love the Marvel world so naturally I love this expansion.  

The miniatures are a delight to behold. The only but for me is that this expansion brings some heavy hitters to the game (that´s not the problem), much more powerful than the ones in the base game, so maybe you wouldn’t want to mix this expansions with the base game. Other than that this game is a blast!

Nice addition to the Heroscape game system.

It’s been almost 5 years since I last played Heroscape. In this period of time, my gaming tastes have changed a lot. Now, I tend to see all Heroscapes as eye candy. They are undoubtingly gorgeous and beautiful, but I feel the game is rather superfluous, thin and with lots of luck. Due to this, I’m not sure if I still can enjoy the game. 

I want to play it again but the thought of having to assemble the map fills me with dread (I hate this in games) so I’m not sure if I will ever play it again. If I do, I will come back to comment again.

Great starting point, but a very basic, scraped set, content wise... They really should have included a bit more terrain, and I would have liked the figures to have a little more in common... Hasbro should have done something like the Marro set, that gives you an all Marro army, and a mix of heroes to fight them. It might have been cool if all the heroes had been Avengers,X-men or the FF, with some suitable enemies. I do understand why they made an eclectic mix, seen from a marketing standpoint, and of course they had to include Spidey in the starting set!
I am sad that the Marvel franchise seems to have ended, though there might still be hope? 
Over on Heroscapers.com, the fine C3G people are making some great customs, that I can highly recommend for more superhero goodness!
I bought an extra Marvel set, for the terrain.

Have played several games. Fun, but needs a litle help in the way of:1. More characters.. the first expansion should help that. It is possible to use other Heroscape characters from the original  and its expansions. 2. More scenarios. I think some of the scenarios for the original Heroscape could easily be used. Scearios can be created fairly easily as well. 

By the way, Hulk can pretty certainly take out Red Skull on the first turn ifhe is within 10 spaces.

UPDATE Even though I saw photos of the next wave that was going to come out, it now appears that it never will. Shame. It would have been good.

Having the Marvel expansion has provided the spark to light up the 6 y.o. interest. Because you can't play this without the advanced rules it requires explaining the full rules.

The most fun for me in Heroscape is using the squad figures and this version of course focuses on superheroes.  The characters are so powerful that it tends to flatten the strategy a bit in my view.  The quicker set-up for a Marvel only battle makes it an easier choice to play with the kids though.

It looks awesome, the guy at the store wanted to sell me the Master Set, but it was about $90 and i didn't had that much money. Instead I bought this and Puerto Rico...

Edit: I really need the Master Set, this system is just great, now i will become addicted to buy expansions!

Edit: Now that I have the Master Set, and played a couple of games, this should become a staple in most games of Heroscape from now on. Some of the Heroes (like Silver Surfer) seem a little overpowered, if you play them against "normal" unique heroes, but against other heroes they are well balanced. The only REAL problem is that when you play with other figures, most of the times you'll get stuck with the Marvel characters at the end of the game...

RATING: 7
The guiltiest of guilty pleasures.  Wonderful self indulgence as Hulk took on Doctor Doom and Spidey dodged the attacks of Abomination.  From the first roll of the dice I was 12 years old again.  Great fun, simple mechanics and a little bit of strategy but not too much to get in the way of creating an engaging narrative.

Recommend for fathers to play with 8+ year old kids.  The board gamer will worry at the power of Hulk and the lack of design sophistication (greater utilisation of the variety of floor tiles would of been interesting) but just roll with it you have a secret lab to either protect or destroy.

(Update - with the growth of the online communities and various tools removes the limits of the original scenarios)

As a stand alone game, this is pretty mediocre. You can't make interesting maps, its all heros, and its pretty devoid of interesting decisions.

Marvel superheroes in Heroscape format! Two great flavors that go great with each other! If you're a fan of these characters and enjoy a good dice-fest, combat game then give it a try. 

My only gripe about playing "Conflict Begins" and combining it with the rest of the Heroscape system is that the Marvel heroes are grossly overpowered making for some very unbalanced games.

RATING: 6
Thus far, I have only played the basic version with my kids.

I think that for the basic version, the game is grossly unbalanced.  It basically comes down to whoever goes first wins.  It is still good for teaching elementary aged kids how to move, counting tiles, and paying attention to height of terrain.  This needs a lot more terrain to really be tactical and would be much more balanced using the advanced rules.

RATING: 8
Minis are pretty good, but the terrain is a little light considering the subject matter.  Expected some lamp posts, mail boxes, dumpsters, power lines and sewer lits that could be thrown, smashed or used in "creative ways."  I was very hesitant to purchase this HS addition, until I found it that it was completely compatible (scaleable with the original HS).  Besides, who doesn't want to see the Hulk take on a dragon?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Half of the characters are wildly overpowered.  And, if you lose one of the powerful characters, you're probably done.  
Our general rule of thumb when playing with these characters (and believe me, the kids love them) is that any time you want to play with any of the figures costing over 300 points, it's generally a "Marvel Only" game of Heroscape.  The figures under 300 points are reasonably playable with other sets.

Heroscapers.com has a group called C3G which makes custom cards for readily available and mostly inexpensive super hero figures.  You can play with nearly any comic book hero/villain you can imagine.  It is great fun!

While I give the actual Marvel set a 7.5 because there's only a little bit of new terrain and only 10 heroes, I give the C3G pantheon a 10.  Get some terrain, buy the superheroes you like and print out their cards and have a blast.

The Marvel characters are a very cool introduction to the Heroscape universe, and they did a really good job making the character cards for each hero.  I also like the mix of heroes they included in the first batch, and there is of course lots of room for expansion.

I am somewhat disappointed with the Marvel set, though.  I have no desire to play only the Marvel figures by themselves, and when compared to the other heroscape stuff, the points cost of the superheroes makes them almost unplayable in all but the biggest games.  As a result, Spider-Man, Venom, and Captain America are the only figures likely to see play.  Also, it isn't the most price effective expansion, since you only get a few figures and a relatively small amount of terrain.  I would hold off on the Marvel set until they've released more figures such that it can play by itself better or there are more low cost figures.

This review is probably a bit biased since I love all things Marvel!

This is a fun light modular strategy game with minor mechanics like attacks of opportunity, height, and special powers.  Each player takes turns moving and taking actions.  Some actions require chance with a d20 and others are like basic attacks.

The game feels pretty balanced as the normal game play consists of players taking turns drafting different characters.  You can make your own missions and maps or you can use the one's provided in the scenario book.

I paid about 50 bucks for my used copy.  It's a great game that everyone seems to enjoy playing and I often am asked to break it out when it's just me and my girl or me and a friend.  If you're in need of a good 2 player board game, search no more!

Please no more. I do not understand the fascination with Heroscape.

Once you've learned the basic game, use the advanced rules, as that's when this game really shines. Much fun. My son Trevor, 10 years old as of April 2009, rated this a "10". The heroes are much more powerful than the figures in the Heroscape Master sets, so I think it's best to pit these Superheroes against one another rather than mix them in with the regular sets. As some others have noted, not a lot of terrain pieces with this set, but if you have one or the other Master sets, then not to worry.

This Heroscape set is the worst of all, for me. I like more the classic Heroscape for a reason: more flexibility in tactics and strategy, thanks to the Gliphs and the common squads composed of multiple units.
Marvel is oriented to a total, exaggerated, mindless blast where stats and character's abilities do all, reducing the tactical options (like movement and range) to the minimum, in my opinion. As an Heroscape's expansion maybe good, but as a stand-alone I find it limited with really little maps and all about dice rolling...

Components are great and the Marvel miniatures very well painted.

Couldn't resist the $12 price tag.  That being said, not much of a game by itself unlike the other Heroscape master systems.  Only 10 figures, and all are unique.  Battles are just one big slug fest.  Not enough terrain to make interesting boards by itself. The minis are very nice, though, and I expect with more terrain and more figures it will start to shine.  But as is, there's not much to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The 2 things that doom this expansion to lower-level HS status is :
1) It is NOT  a Master Set.  A kid can't buy this and start a real HS game. There are WAY too few tiles to make any real map with, so Hasbro branding this as a "Master Set" is an exaggeration/confusing at best and blatant misrepresentation at worst.
2) The inevitable inability to include this with the base game because of inbalanced units (in comparison to standard HS units) means that they really should be only played against their own units (unless it's casual play, in which case you should play with tons of customs units since balance is not a concern).
The fatal flaw is that there are only handful of units to play against each other. This set really desperately needed an expansion or 2 to fill out some of the playstyles that superhero miniature combat can bring. It's really too bad that Hasbro chintzed out big time and denied HSers the Marvel Supplement 1 which was already designed and prototyped. All they had to do was roll the presses on them and let the marketplace decide.

Great minis and very playable. Mechanics are really simple and appropriate for children. Each character also has unique abilities (Spidey Sense, Shield Throw, etc) that solidify the comicbook feel. Would benefit from some additional options, but for a quick battle game, it's hard to beat (especially for comicbook fans).

Some great plays with my then 8-year old. She's had no problem grasping the rules and was a Silver Surfer fan. Both she and her little sister can identify all the characters and their powers. Will enjoy this moment while it lasts--rating goes up to an 8.

Nice blend of Heroscape with Marvel comics heroes and villains. The game actually works really well within the confines of the Heroscape world. My only problem is the lack of terrain and characters in the base set. 
With that said, the units in the base game do mix to make a nice playable setting and a pretty balanced game.
After a few more plays I have lowered my rating from 8 to 7. While I do still like this game there are some issue. As a stand alone game, it is fun, but it lacks enough terrain and glyphs to make a truly spirited map. Also, these guys are powerful. Don't mix them with lower heroscape units.

Fantastic.  While I feel a little jipped by the amount of terrain, and thus the scale of game (as it stands coming out of the box)...  I have to say that this really captures the comic book feel.  Special Abilities are well thought out and seem to be in line with the comics.  I am intrigued by some of the text on the card...  Hulk may leap up to 50 levels high?  Could they be coming out with buildings?  Overall I feel that this is a logical and exception direction for the Heroscape franchise, and could be the begining of a massive saturation into other areas...  GI Joe, Transformers, Avatar, etc...  There really doesn't seem to be a limit...  and now all of us that bought way too much heroscape terrain have a place to use it.

This game alone is not spectacular.I rate it a 5 as a stand alone. The characters are all so powerful that I felt like it took forever to kill anything.The terrain is also limited to the point where the layouts possible are very dissapointing. This was the first heroscape set that I owned. However, when this game is combined with the master set Rise of the Valkerie this game becomes amazing in my opinion. When choosing 400 point armies I chose the hulk at 370 points and my apponent ended up with four or five army cards with two heroes from Valkerie and the rest squads. I proceded to slap the crap out of his army with hulk. Spider man and venom were the characters it took to take down the hulk on the next play. The only way to play this game is when it is combined with other sets and characters. When the characters are combined with Rise of the Valkerie, the Marvel cast is a 10.

This seems to me like an incomplete product.  It comes with just a scant amount of terrain and a few figures (compared to the other HeroScape master sets) and the future of the MarvelScape line is unknown.  That said, I still had fun playing and consider it a worthy addition to a HeroScape collection if you find it at a discounted price.

RATING: 7
For all the additional terrain, it deserves an 8 however the game itself is a bit limited. If there had been a few more expansions providing figures and Modern terrain features created it would have been good. It does excel at being a genre specific version of Heroscape as it doesn't mix well with the rest.

I'll believe it when I see it. The first heroscape took 1 year (from US release date) to appear in Australia...then it flopped after one wave of expansion figures. Doubt this will come to Australia any time soon (if at all).

To clarify my rating: I purchased a LOT of custom figures and expansions for this. I have new figures for everything from the X-Men to The Wreckers, and loads of terrain including trees, bridges, lava, etc. By itself, I would rate Marvel HeroScape probably a bland 6.0... but with all the add-ons, it's a great experience for this Marvel fan.

As a Marvel fan-boy, this is like peanut butter and chocolate for me. Others tend to feel differently. However, it really should've been called "Heroscape Marvel: The Conflict Begins and Abruptly Ends." Not one single expansion. They had an awesome one planned. It had The Punisher.....THE PUNISHER!!!! There was a miniature and everything.... Grrrrrr....

RATING: 6
A disappointment for me. I really wanted to like this one, but it comes with too little terrain to make an interesting battlefield - the maps provided are far too small for units with such power.

Had the game been better received, and the planned expansions been released, the Marvel set might have reached critical mass, but as is I see only some odd man out figures that don't mesh very well with mainstream 'Scape, which has better scenarios and which I will play while Marvel languishes in the closet.

Now HERE is what "Marvel Heroes" should have been - a light, fast-moving, fun game of heroic adventures!  This is my first foray into the HeroScape world, and it has been an enjoyable experience.  But I am hoping they quickly come out with some expansions to support the Marvel universe, since the base game doesn't provide nearly enough terrain or interesting scenarios, and it could certainly use some groups of weaker henchmen!  [Edit: Sadly, it appears that this is not to be.]  I can see why people of all ages enjoy this sort of thing, but I definitely need more than I was provided with in the base set!

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  I am not a huge fan of Heroscape in general.  The whole game just seems so basic.  A guy has attack, has defence, has some special ability and you roll a lot of dice.  blah... I played once with this Marvel version in a 3 player free for all.  The game struck me as being very small, there is really not a lot of figures or terrain with just the base game.  The game came down to the wire, and had an exciting finish.  My 8 year old son loved it.  My 8 year old son loves this game so we picked it up now.  We are going to go through the scenarios next.

RATING: 7
I initially really liked this game (I still do).  My interest went up even higher with all of the fan made army cards available through the hard work and generosity of the League of Heroscapers.  My son and  I printed out the army cards and bought a big collection of  Heroclix figures to use them.  Worked  great together.

We haven't played much because of the infusion of new games (summoner wars and legendary in particular) that we have  had and after awhile the game felt like it was hard to get out of someone's range so we just ended up getting in range and rolling dice.  Good times though.

I also only have the terrain that game with this game and that might have also hurt it's replayability.  

It is also a lot easier to set up Legendary than a round of heroscape.

The fast action of Heroscape suits the comic book characters well, and the stats nicely capture their feel.  They also seem appropriately powerful compared to regular Heroscape models.
The terrain and model selection in this set is really skimpy though; it works trying the game out, but you can't really build anything more than a single leve high.

RATING: 6.5
Power creep is fine when the increased power is matched by escalating costs. The Marvel heroes (and villains) are massively more powerful than pretty much anything I saw in the base game. The point value is a simple (and pretty brilliant) way of balancing the game and offering tons of replayability.

Also, though not strictly part of this entry, the expansion characters created by Heroscapers.com pretty much make this have infinite replayability, even if I'm actually not that taken by 'Marvelscape'.

Update: Unfortunately 'SuperScape' tends to descend into 2 characters standing next to each other throwing buckets of dice. It strips out all of the strategy in the game and, for me, makes it a lot less fun.

Rating down from 8 to 6.5.

I have 65 Marvelscape characters to be traded as well.

The box stupidly includes a bunch of cool characters with too much mobility and woefully insufficient landscape tiles to accommodate their mobility.  This should definitely have been marketed as an expansion as it makes a pretty lousy game on its own.  Having said that, the superheroes are dominant when mixed with other HeroScape characters, so it's not even all that great of an expansion.

Awesome looking minis, though.

As I mentioned in the previous installment for Q1 & Q2, I finally tried HeroScape in June 2009, and found it to be very fun. I had the opportunity to play HeroScape again in August, and this time with the Marvel characters, among many other expansions (e.g., Swarm of the Marro, Utgar's Rage, Orm's Return, Jandar's Oath, Fields of Valor, Thora's Vengeance, Raknar's Vision, and Ticalla Jungle). I think that the Marvel expansion ruins HeroScape. It introduces characters that are far too powerful. They live for too long and make most other units completely irrelevant non-factors. It took an enjoyable, chaotic, amusing game and threw a massive wrench into the works. I'm sure I'm not the right audience since I'm not particularly a Marvel fan and don't know all of the Marvel characters. I'm also sure that some people who are huge fans of Marvel may find this expansion enjoyable. However, for those of you who are somewhat familiar with Marvel, but not overly so, and who enjoy the original version of HeroScape, I recommend being wary of the Marvel expansion and the imbalance it brings to a finely tuned and well-crafted game.

RATING: 6
The figures are nice, but the lack of terrain/props doesn't help my rating any.  I'm guessing the licensing for the figures raises the price point past adding significant extras.

Expected expansions haven't shown up yet.  I'm wondering if they ever will, now that I've seen this clearance priced around $15.

As a stand-alone game, Marvel Heroscape manages to hold up.  As a total part of the Heroscape universe, it is an awesome addition.

11/09 Update: There seems to be a good deal of people/reviews who aren't crazy about this... I have no idea why.  The models are great, the powers are exactly what you would expect from the heroes, and the total butt-kickers like the Hulk and the Abomination are appropriately powered.  Screw balance!  If you like Comics, you can't miss with this set.

I like the idea of this more than I do "regular" HeroScape but it just didn't play as well. Perhaps it's the lack of variety, which is something I hope they will remedy in the future. This game with more heroes and villains and even squads (henchmen, cops, soldiers) would be something! Sure, one can use figures from the other HeroScape sets but I would far prefer figures from the world of Marvel.

First Play - Basic setup - We played this with the kids and had a blast. It was the basic setup so there wasn't anything to the game (move, attack, roll) but I added commentary and sound effects so they wanted to play the same game over and over again. After 3 times I had enough. We pulled it out again the next day and had one more basic game with the kids before moving on to the advanced rules. This was a lot more fun. Seeing Spidey swing away when his spidey senses tingled and having Captain America ricochet his shield off several enemies at once in a single attack made it much more like a comic book or movie. I'm adding the additional pack to my must-buy list. The minis are awesome!

There's a certain charm to the rules - one of the more intuitive games I've played. It also feels true to the theme, even though this is a retheme. Having said that, as a 2 player game, I wasn't thrilled with this. By the end, I was thinking that it's like a C&C System game but worse in every way except the license. I thought I would like it multiplayer, but it didn't change much other than the game length, unfortunately.

Ok, I am a Marvel fan, AND I love Heroscape (maybe too much), so this game should have been a huge hit for me.  As it was...well, it was OK.  Maybe it is just too early in the series, but it just felt so one dimensional.  So flat.  Not good for a 3D game, eh? Could be I am comparing it too much to regular Heroscape which has had some years to build up a world of its own.

That being said, Marvelscape needs to hustle out a few expansions FAST to flesh out its new world and capture a fan base that may not love comics as much as I and others do...

I don't think the super-expensive heroes mix well with the other characters. They seem to emphasize the role of luck in the game a little too much.  Still, extra terrain and the lower-end heroes make it a nice sale grab.

What Heroclix should have been all along.  A nice clean rules set. Great terrain bits like Heroscape but not as much of it.  However, the Heroes included are great and well painted.  The game interfaces well with the original as well, but the figures in this set are very powerful and would take a good army from the regular set to take one down.  Lots of plastic and dice rolling.  Strategies come in with where to place your action tokens.  Gets my vote for best off-the-shelf game system this year.

*Several models missingnow, but it's a fun set - not as good value as the other base sets, though.

Who would have those this hotly anticipated game would have turned out to be a bit of dud? Well, from a sales standpoint anyway. As a standalone set, I thought it was better than most, giving you just enough tiles to set up quick smash and bash fests. The included scenario's are actually pretty creative, they just need bigger playing fields. The figures are mega powerful compared to normal Heroscape figures, so go crazy pitting everything you can against them, although some may STILL not think they are powerful enough (It's possible that the almighty Hulk could be swallowed in one gulp by Griminak the dinosaur from the original masterset). There are other rule additions including "superstrength" which keeps Marvel figures from being affected by falling damage (which is silly since most of them can fly anyway) and that cancel out any "reinforced" rules that apply to destructable objects (also kind of silly since there's only two destructable objects in all of Heroscape). If you just want a quick bash em up game, it's OK on its own. If you want stuff to incorporate with all your other Heroscape sets, it's really only a good start. And since sales were blah, it's probably going to be a good finish.

Como juego individual no merece la pena en absoluto. Como expansiÃ³n es interesante.

A good addition to the Heroscape system.  Powers for some of the characters are weak, and the Hulk is incredibley powerful, but overall a nice game.  Works wonderfully when combined with the rest of the system.  As a standalone game, I would rate it a 6.

Worth having all the minis and pieces, but they are very overpowered.

Good addition to heroscape, but not enough on it's own.  Rated as an entire system in Rise of the Valkyrie entry.

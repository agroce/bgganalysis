Like El Grande Lite.  I enjoyed the area control aspect, although I feel it isn't quite as tightly-knit as El Grande or as fun/tactical as Tigris & Euphrates.

Wouldn't need to own, but would easily play again.

Initial rating was a 7 but after a few more plays I'm dropping it to a 6.  It is a medium-light, fast area control game that typifies the Knizia design.  Fun, accessible and quick, it just lacks that little something that makes the game compelling.

Állítólag egy 20+ éves Knizia újrakiadása. Nekem mindenképp új volt, és egész izgalmas, egy kicsit a Taj Mahalt idézte, de sokkal-sokkal könnyedebb és egyszerűbb a szabály. A pontszám mehet még fölfelé, a káoszosság ellenére is.

Played a short two-player game with my son. Good fun - all about seeding the path ahead and trying to one-up one-another by getting in an extra region at the ideal time. I'm looking forward to playing more.

[13 Nov 2017] - 6.5 (1 play)
Teaching play with only 2 players. It was an interesting game where neither of us really had a good idea what we wanted to do. The rules are easy to understand and teach. The game really focuses on trying to keep up in points with your opponents and picking when you want to flex the power in your hand. The theme is not important to the game play at all. I want to play a few more times and then re-evaluate the rating.

[11 Feb 2018] - 7 (1 play)
Moving this to a 7 after a play with 3 experienced gamers. The game is simple - pick cards to add influence to and score the majority influence at the end of the round when the king is in the region. Yet we had a lot of tough decisions trying to calculate what the other players are going to do and using the 3 special cards to manipulate the base rules of the game. In the end a wishful miscalculation on my part gave the game away to one of the other players. Best part is that it wraps up in 30 minutes without much fuss. The lines denoting which region is which could have been clearer on the board and does make it a little tough specifically on the left side of the board. I think playing with the persistence noble variant will help the game as well.

Colourful reinvention of Imperium, from Neue Spielen im Alten Rom, and later Rome from GMT.  Select three cards from your hand of 11, and action them.  Place pieces, score regions, rinse and repeat.  Plays blisteringly fast, which I think is a good quality in area majority games.  Once again, Knizia proves he knows what he's doing - this one ends at just the right time.  Excellent choice for a re-boot by Grail Games.

RATING: 8
Simultaneous selection requires you to evaluate the likelihood of multiple plays opponents could make, then take a risk. Provides interesting choices between short-term, medium-term, long-term, and game-end gains. The dragon and witch cards allow for occasional surprises. Good game length. Easy to teach. Player-driven. Lots to explore. Tension throughout. Good narrative arc with players leapfrogging each other until a big endgame showdown.

This was interesting to see how it played out, but it made me slightly uncomfortable as it seemed straightforward but like there was something fundamental I didn't understand about it. As in, I understood the rules, but felt I didn't grasp something fundamental about how to play. The question is thus, would it 'click' upon multiple plays, or is it just light with some strategy but really nothing that intrigues me.

Easy to learn "Gateway Game". At least that's my opinion. Super quick to explain and easy to get into. Every time we reveal the location cards there will always be groans or complaints & accusations being thrown out (mostly from me) and yet we can't really get mad at them since it's all hidden information. 

Highly recommended =D

RATING: 6.9
Very easy to teach and play. Game play is simple; everyone simultaneously picks and reveals 3 cards. Area control. First play we forgot about doing end game scoring (whoops!) which definitely would change the strategy for the final quarter of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An elegantly simple breath of fresh air. Cannot recall anything else that combines a straightforward, bare-bones ruleset, and yet somehow manages to be this mentally grueling. The deductive reasoning in determining an optimal play is easy, the inductive reasoning necessary to determine how your opponents might mess up your plans is anything but.

Scales like butter from 3-5. Few knocks against it. Engrossing, fast, satisfying thinker's game. Few better warm-up games have existed/will ever exist. Cheers, Dr. Knizia. Releasing this as a standalone was a beautiful decision.

RATING: 6
Straight forward area control game with very little you could do to affect your opponents. The decision comes from trying to get to unscored areas earlier than everyone else that you pull ahead of your opponents. There is a bit of speculation and mind games in that. It feels a little underwhelming and I wish there is more to a Knizia game. The artwork from Vincent Dutrait is very beautiful and Grail Games production is again top notch.

- The game has too little decisions to make with only three cards. Also if somebody has the same plan as you then you cancel each other out and cannot win.

Old-school (in a good way) area majority game with characteristically clever Knizia twists. While the game looks ok it could do with clearer graphical design to make it quicker to see which card matches which area.

Was looking forward to play another simple Knizia game, but this one left me feeling ... meh. Components and artwork are all fine, but the whole simultaneous area selection mechanic never feels very fun to me. I would compare this feeling to how Revolution! plays - you end up making a lot of moves that are wasted. Also, there is no "catching up" here - if someone is beating you in counters at a location, you cannot catch up since you can both add the same max number of counters per turn.

8 területet jár végig a király a játék során többször is, a játékosok minden területhez rendelkeznek egy-egy kártyával, ezek közül szimultán játszanak ki hármat egyszerre és ezekre a területekre teszik fel egy-egy jelölőjüket. A király érkezésekor többséget nézve értékelődnek ki a területek. 1-8 pontig kap a legtöbb jelölővel rendelkező, játékosszámtól függően eggyel kevesebben kapnak pontot, mint ahány játékos van. Van három speciális lap, amiből kettő csak egyszer használatos, az egyikkel még egy terület értékelődik ki azonnal, a másikkal pedig a többiek válaszott hármasát látva választhatjuk ki a saját hármasunkat. Egy különleges lap pedig arra használható, hogy egy területre plusz egy jelölőnket helyezhetjük el, ezzel a körben csak két területre helyezve. A társas Knizia 1994-es ötlete újra feldolgozva, szebb dizájn kapva. A játék rendkívül egyszerű és gyors, de nem igazán áll hozzám közel a másik gondolatának kitalálása típusú mechanizmus, főleg ha más nincs mellette, de a gyorsasága miatt azért nem utasítanék el vele következő partit sem.

This is my sort of game. A simple area control, simultaneous action game that plays well at any player count and plays in half an hour. While this is a great two player game and works really well at all player counts I do prefer it at 3/4/5 however since there is a little more chaos and a little more trash talking at the table. It is very simple to teach and play yet very strategic and always plays in about half an hour. It is so well balanced that there isn't an ideal strategy (although I imagine there probably is but if everyone is playing it then it isn't the ideal strategy anymore) and the dragons balance out game time perfectly. More players, more dragons available to play and speed the scoring up. Really enjoying this game!

**I realized I missed final scoring on first play, so this rating will likely improve on subsequent play.**

Lovely production. The group I played it with was tired after a long game day, so it wasn't the best setting to teach/learn/play a game in. It's a game of placing out area control markers based on simultaneous card selection (three at a time).

That said, I didn't feel the game presented too many crunchy scenarios for big decisions. The special cards (dragon, knight, witch) allow you to create some little combos in the game, and the noble scoring is interesting, but the merry-go-round nature of the board just ends up being kind of a point trade that isn't all that satisfying.

Also, our first game had three tie-breakers for nobles when going around the board the first time, and this ended up just kingmaking one player who had stumbled into getting a couple of nobles, providing them with 10-12 extra points, which was more than enough for the win. A bit weird.

I'd like to try it again.

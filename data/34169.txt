Simple, ok in length (based on my 4p game), good mechanisms with good artwork. The alchemy theme is just a paste-on but it's a nice one.Overall, good impressions although you dont want to think too much on your turn:the game is quite luck-prone(draw from the deck) with a twist (since you can use lower level potions of others during your turn earning them a few point sin the process) but still nothing too twc ical or strategic.

Very good looking cardgame with a splendid theme. Every Harry Potter lover will love to mix the exotic ingredients to make even more exotic potions, talismans and amulets. The game starts of a bit slow but picks up speed very quickly towards the endgame. The game is all about hand management and timing. Play can slow down a bit when people are trying to identify the cards on the table as the design is pretty busy and most potions look alike. But it still makes for an interesting and beautiful cardgame. Will have to play more to see if it has staying power.

Not interesting enough in the current market to get extended plays. Traded it away.

Provisional rating - first play was with 6 which felt very chaotic. No planning, lots of downtime and sometimes some very limited choices on your turn.

However, I could see the game here and I definitely want to try again with 3 or 4 players. it felt like the game would be much better with this number.

Review copy from RightGames.

We've played it twice with 2 players using Gamegrunt's variant. We both like it and it will most probably see some table time before going to the next reviewer.
It is a light game, but I believe there's some kind of strategical aspect to it in deciding which potion to make and to make a potion or not.

I only wonder why they put the "potion's map" at the back of the scoring track. This way, you can't refer to it during the game.

RATING: 8
This is a simple but engaging card game. Players use ingredients from a common pool to create compounds which in turn can be used to create more complex magical creations. You can even grab compounds your opponents have previously made but this means they're going to get some points as well... This game isn't really like anything else I have which makes it very refreshing. While the game says it can play up to 6 people I'm not sure I'd want to as knowing what all of your opponents have in front of them is important and that could become problematic. So far I've played up to a four player game and I noticed that there seems to be a much bigger gap in the score with more players.

I'm a big Harry Potter fan, so the theme and artwork leads me to a high personal rating; on the gameplay so far (2 plays) I'd rate it 6 or 7.  More spell cards that allow players to move cards from the element deck to their hands would make the game more interesting; as it is I feel that strategic play will only be open to those who know the deck well.

I'd like to try it with the expansions, should they ever be released in English.

A terrific filler card game from Russia.  Players are mixing elements and other ingredients to make formulas for magical potions which earn them points.  See my pictorial review: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/778479

Check a [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/693309/gamegrunts-gryphon-a-two-player-variant]variant[/url] that potentially improves the game by distributing spells to players at the game start. Also recommended is to use the [thread=723464][/thread].

Könnyed bájitalkevergetős kártyajáték. A kártyákat kétféle képpen lehet kijátszani.
1. alapanyagként: ebben az esetben a később kijátszandő receptekhez lehet őket majd felhasználni
2. receptként: a rendelkezésre álló alapanyagokból lehet főzetet készíteni. A létrejövő főzet szintén alapanyagként funkcionál az összetett főzetekhez.
Ezen felül van még három féle varázslat, ami nagyon megnöveli a kombinációk számát.
A játék nem igényel komoly stratégiát vagy taktikát, viszont viszonylag nagy odafigyelést, mert nagyon sokféle alapanyag és recept van a játékban. Ha nem figyel az ember, akkor el tud szalasztani egy esetleges keverési lehetőséget. 
Könnyed, beszélgetős, esetleg levezető/felvezető társasnak ideális.

Potion-Making: Practice is a simple filler card game in which players combine ingredients to brew potions or create other alchemistic products. Gameplay is fairly simple with increasing randomness towards the upper end of the player count. Easily understood theme and cutesy graphics should make this palatable to non-gamers as well.

Prosta gra zapewniająca rozgrywkę na około 30-45 min. Za każdym razem inna mimo nie tak wielu kart. Dobrze sprawdza się jako gra dwuosobowa, przy 6 osobach jest w porządku, ale może się zdarzyć, że gracze podbierają sobie składniki, w wyniku czego 1 lub 2 osoby mogą być poszkodowane i mieć problem z uwarzeniem mikstur. Może być dosyć losowa, ale nie przeszkadza to w odbiorze.

Great, simple, and quite atmospheric game. Despite the fact that it consists of only a deck of cards (tracker points - and he seems to have, but it can be done without it.)
For those who like the Harry Potter universe, and all the magic, it's a good game. We mix magical ingredients, getting potions, which then can turn into an elixir, if you're lucky :-). Feel like a student in class at Severus Snape :-))).

RATING: 6.5
Copy provided by the publisher for review.  Initial play was highly favorable!  After five games, my conclusion is that the spell cards are so critical to the play of the game that their distribution should not be left to chance.  My variant would assign the three different spells to each player in a two player game to use as they choose - normal hand limit would then be seven, with an 8th drawn at the beginning of a turn.  Playing the game by the rules can result in a runaway leader when one player draws the lion's share of the spells and uses them wisely.

I think the game works best with two players as multi-player games have entirely too much luck.

I hate sound so negative, but Potion-Making Practice is an amateurish mess on every level. Gameplay-wise it borders on hilarious (4 card hands in a game, where you need two of 16 different kinds of resorces to do something - have fun trying to plan ahead). The art looks good at first glance, but is a usability disaster.

RATING: 5
Somewhat filler, but colorful.   This seems more of a children's game than anything else.   Still wanted to buy a board game from Russia, just so I said I could. 

- Requires a lot of table space.
* Has a mechanic I have never seen before
* Great mechanic, just wish it could have been pulled off better.
* Relief from the AP prone
- Extremely luck driven game, you can with bad luck have next to nothing mixed. 
- No capability for strategy or tactical, can end up only mixing 1 or 2 potions a game.

Potion Explosion blows this out of the water.

This game is a surprise in a small package.  After three plays, we find it has a wonderful balance between luck and strategy.

A fun light card game for the Harry Potter set out there. The game has only a few decision points, but that is part of it's charm. Sometimes a player can get screwed by their card draws, but ultimately the game does revolve around doing the best with what you have, and knowing when to play some of the upper level spells, and when to not. It's like the song says "You have to know when to hold em, know when to fold em." Wait, you can't fold em in this game. Nevermind.
If you have kids around, and like acting like you are Snape's class, this is the game for you.

I’d find it hard not to immediately love a game that allows me to alchemically create an Avocado Homounculus, and thoughtfully provides a cute/yucky illustration of how such a creature would look like. 

Fortunately, Potion Maker does not make it too hard to be loved. Although the basic premise of combining ingredients to brew potions is neither original nor particularly fruitful for a game, the possibility of using finished potions for other, more rewarding formulas is what makes this game shine. Apart from being truthful to medieval alchemical belief, these higher formulas introduce a bit of planning and a lot of interaction into the game, because when other players use your potions to create more exciting stuff, you will reap some of the rewards.

All in all, a very impressive little game that I’d like to revisit soon, if only to determine how much of my positive first impression is due to winning decisively ;)

Review copy from RightGames LLC. Simple and delightful card game for 2-6 player, where you try to combine ingredients  to make potions. More complex potions require you to mix existing potions, and are worth more points. Cards represent basic ingredients, played to the centre of the table, or potions, played in front of you. The potions made increase nicely in complexity and value as the game progresses. Very fun, and lovely artwork.

I just acquired this for my daughter who is a huge Harry Potter fan. We've played once, and it was enjoyable. I can see there is more to this game than 100% luck, but it will take some learning of the cards to be able to anticipate needs a bit better. Thanks to Ender for bringing it to my attention!

UPDATE: I've probably played this 20 times with my daughter. It is a decent game, but probably is better in theme than in execution. We had fun with it, but it is time for the game to go to the trade block so my daughter and I can explore something else.

I finally found a copy from the Russian website. It was a Birthday gift in fact for my wife. It is in English too.


This game has wonderful mechanics and great artwork. It's very unique and unlike anything else I have ever seen. You have a hand of cards where you may use the cards for it's potion or you may use it for it's ingredient. Once you collect certain selected ingredients, including the use of some face up on the table, you can create a potion. Once you have made a certain number of potions you can combine them into something truly amazing. Like making a Unicorn or something.

The game does go on for a long time, basically until the deck runs out. I was going to try on our next play through removing an amount of cards from the deck to make the game a more reasonable length.

In this game, you're trying to make increasingly more complex potions from different reagents to score points.  You can use your opponents' completed potions as reagents too, but that scores them some points.  It's very random, but being a card game, that's not too surprising.  Graphic design is not great: in particular the potions were difficult to tell apart from one another (the base reagents were fine), and you really needed to know which ones your opponents have.  Goes nicely in the "brainless filler" category, if you're into that sort of thing.

This game is like  rummy with more interaction and more theme but without adding more fun. Put another way, it is like Glory To Rome if there was no role selection and if every card did 2 things instead of 4+. Sound boring? It is. 

This game could have been much more fun if cards had more functions but as it is it is a simple game that is a bit of a drudge. I hate to say that it was not fun because that is not entirely accurate. It is more true to say that it is a bit of mind numbing fun. Nothing nutritious or tasty here just some bland old popcorn that has lost most of it's flavor but is better than no sustenance at all.

I enjoy this game - learned with a group of new players.  It seemed to be tough on the players who got "big" cards in their initial hand while other smaller potions got built quicker.  It's very luck driven based on what elements are available and what the player to your right snatches up before you are able to build.

I want to like this game.. and there are parts of it that I do, but ultimately it just felt way too random and frustrating for me.  That may have a lot to do with the player count.  

Things I desperately needed would be put out by the player after me and disappear well before it came back to my turn.  I'd often come up with a plan A, a plan B and a plan C only to find that all my plans were wrecked by the time it got back to me.  Additionally, some of my high value potions weren't buildable for the majority of the game, one of which required a thing that never showed up in the game at all.  

Some of my potions were used by other players which gave me some points, but I have no idea what potions are likely to be needed and so this was a fairly random "Oh, hey, I get four points".  There are some spells in the game... but as I never drew one, I'm not really sure how they work, only that they seemed cool for those that used them.  

The game largely seemed to be "Pray to the gods and draw a card, then build the best thing you can. Rinse and repeat."  And that the winner was decided by who drew the best formulas that could actually be built.

Первая отечественная идея "на уровне" грандов. Еще бы полиграфию получше и коробочку...

Это скорее тренировка внимательности, а не игра. На столе лежат до 16 типов ингридиентов, и надо из 4-х карт в руке высматривать чего из этих ингридиентов можно сварить. И все это просто на очки. Интереса - ноль.

Высокий уровень рандома. Трудно строить долгоидущие стратегии. Приятная семейка для отдыха мозга или как легкий филлер. Гикам категорически не рекомендуется. Легко играется с новичками.

This one, I didn't like, it just seems to drag-on waiting for the right cards/ingredients to come up.

My wife likes it. It is not suited for coffee-house play due to the space required. Generally a pleasant and attractive game. A little too few choices to let it be rated higher.

This intriguing, beautiful game is a generous gift from Svetlana. Thank You! :kiss:

This proved to be a gem game with about 30 plays in a month! On most occasions we played it between two, with our small modification of the rules (see Variants of the game).

Excellent lunch-time choice, and a great teaser on our gaming parties.

Initial rate 6. After several plays, I find it a nice, relaxing 2-player card game, although luck is an important factor in order to win.

I've played about three times, you get more successful when you realize that at the beginning and even mid game (depending of number of players) you need to concentrate on low-cost recipes. But regardless, it feels that there is little strategy in this game. Combining cards just for the sake of it is not fun for me. And with the hand of only 4 cards it's difficult to make informed decisions as to what cards may be useful in future and what can be discarded to the element bank. So the rule for me became: discard expensive ones, keep cheap ones. Only keep playing it because my family seem to like it.

Seemed way too much dependant on luck of draw. Also, you cannot really plan any moves. All you do is make the best possible move each turn.

Очень хорошая игра для начинающих игроков. Отлично подойдёт для 3-6 игроков, но неплохо играется и вдвоём.

Initial rating based on only 1 play.  I think the game needs more to finalise the rating.
The only game I've played was doom-laden from the start.  I think we took a couple too many big risks and even the little risks didn't work, so I know we played poorly.
Will probably give it a go solo to get a solid grasp on the mechanics.

Fun co-op game for exactly four players. The rules for less than four players make the game a little less fun. Also, this game makes it very easy for one player to dictate the action. It falls way short of Pandemic.

After three plays, this game is super challenging but a lot of fun. I really enjoy playing as any character and it produces really good group dialogue. The game is long, and it is very hard to win, but after a few plays some of the strategies start to make more sense.

Firstly the problems:
- Bad rulebook
- you will lose first 2-3 games (maybe because of missunderstanding of rules and also in order to get all the rules into memory)
- if you finish it, it will last 1.5 h and certainly not 60 min as written on the box :(

Good things:
- it does not feel repetative as Space Hulk the card game sometimes feels (although a very good game; and a lot shorter; genestealers are more similar in effects and only differ in movement)as ghosts are very different from each other and have different effects so the deck of ghost cards and the red incarnation card give you a unique experience.
- it feels you have really achieved something if you win :D
- it really feels you are fighting to the eadge and to the last drop of your energy with the ghosts. The Taoists are cool and there are moments when you feel that on your turn your Taoist has acomplished the impossible. 

I have won 1 out of 4 games now

It is more practical and smooth in compariton to Death Angel.

This comes as close as possible to what I consider top co-op: Many meaningful and equally difficult decisions, extreme challenging (but doable), also difficult for someone to "overlord" the other players strategies, due to the random nature of the dice. But best (and why it is the top scoring co-op on my list) - it does not take a few hours of buildup to get to the gist of it - the terror strikes from the get go! (Unlike BSG/Arkham and others)

Absolutely love this game.  A cooperative game where players have decisions to make.  It's hard to know what you should always do and what you shouldn't.  Everyone gets involved and tries to think about what the best options are.  Probably the best cooperative game I can think of.  If only the rules would have been written better.

A very nasty game with a lot of different options. I prefer playing with four, but any of the player counts are ok. I think that people looking for a really thematic game with lots of narrative will be disappointed, but those wanting a tense game with agonizing decisions will be quite pleased.

This is not a game, this is a torture of the players by a game. It would help me a lot to enjoy the game if I would have the opportunity to play the game more than once a year, but under these circumstance I always lost and left the table with a really bad taste in my mouth.

Some little less subjective critics:the balance between the length of the game and the luck involved is somewhat fragile, or I dare to say unexisting. In my last game we collected all the tao tokens in order to fight with the incarnation with the most chance to win, but flipped which incarnation? The one who is immune against those tokens.

Very good cooperative game. Only played once, but can certainly see the potential. It's interesting and hard. Sometimes choices are a bit constrained as it seems some situations will dictate exactly what's the most important thing to do at any time.

Update 2010 01 24

This is now my favorite solo game. I have a decent win rate on nightmare level, and I enjoy the challenge the game continues to offer. That said, there is so much randomness to the setup that some games are definitely easier than others, but the re-playability that brings makes it a decent trade-off. Also, the relatively short playtime makes any oddball session not a big deal.

Update 2009 12 26:

I've now played half a dozen more times, and I am kicking up my rating substantially. I now win consistently at the initiate level and feel ready to tackle the tougher difficulties. Getting to know the various powers and making them work together is very important, and once you figure it out the game difficulty becomes much more manageable

This is a fantastic euro for solo play. It's a compelling puzzle with a huge amount of variability built in due to the variety of Taoist powers, the variety of the ghosts and the different Wu-Feng incarnations in each session. 

Great game.

Original comment:

This is a hard game to rate because it is so hard to beat. 

I've now played about half a dozen games and came close once or twice, but I've never won. As a solo game, it has the potential to be fantastic, because it's a challenging single player experience which has a real win condition (unlike other solo-friendly games that I own like Agricola, Steam w/single player maps or Race for the Galaxy) AND the playtime is a reasonable 30-45 minutes (unlike LOTR). I'm just hoping that the difficulty is the result of my inexperience... if it's simply a question of winning when things come out in a certain order (like solitaire), then I will lose interest quickly.

For now, lots to explore.

Its like a much easier to grasp, shorter, more strategic version of Arkham Horror. The instruction manual is rather poorly translated but the forums on BGG can clear up most of the problems pretty quickly.

EDIT: After 3 plays the novelty has worn off a bit. This is a puzzle game like pandemic. Turns can become repetitive, several tiles are rarely used :( downgraded from 10 to 7.

Not a bad coop game, but loooong!  I wish the game felt as if it was building toward something, but it's just a wash-rinse-repeat to stay alive.  Lovely art, though.

A difficult cooperative game where the odds quickly stack up against the players, Ghost Stories provides the means for excellent planning, teamwork, and satisfaction as a reward for completion.

I played it once on the easiest level.  It was everything I would want in a cooperative game.  I felt immersed in the theme, I loved the tension in the decisions we had to make, and I really felt like we had to work as a team in every aspect.  I played with a good group - no one seemed to dominate the team - and undoubtedly that helped establish my positive impression.  Everyone came away with a sense of accomplishment.  I have a sense that more difficult levels will add strategic depth, not just add more foes to fight... time and more plays will tell if I am right.

A very interesting coop.  I like the use of individual powers and random board layout.  Felt very pressured, increasing threats, constant pressure to address them.  Plays rather smoothly.  Very tight game.

The game I played was a 4-player on the easiest difficulty.  Even then, we only barely won and that was with having 2 people sacrifice themselves for "the greater good."  I've heard harder difficulties may be nigh impossible.

I like this one, even over Pandemic!  GS has a nicer flow to it, more options, more complex decisions and more pressure.  It felt more fun.  I would definitely play GS again.

Played twice (with expansion), and (unbelievably) won once.  Although both games were enjoyable enough, it felt like not a lot more than a tactical scramble. 

Update: two more games, without expansion, and again won once (on initiate level - previous games were I believe on normal).  Certainly enjoyable, and the tactical scramble isn't all that's going on here: you're trying to keep 'centred' enough to handle whatever the game throws at you next, and that involves some more strategic losing-the-battle-to-win-the-war decisions.

Update: played many times now on the iPad.  This is a wonderful co-op.

At first, a very solid seeming co-op, but then the sheer random difficulty and lack of a narrative arc (the end is essentially "oh we're dead, we have nothing left -- oh, whee, we randomly had the right stuff to handle the villain it's over" or more likely "oh he needs a color we're out of, we die"...  meh.

Great coop game, with a very fast setup and a great ~1 h play time. The game seems to me way more tactical than pandemic, which has more of a strategic element.

The use of dice also make it more random than Pandemic, and dice variability must be taken into account in order to win.

The disposition of the tiles, the variable Wu-fengs and the random appearance of Ghosts and player powers ensure a huge replayability.

The default game difficulty is way harder than Pandemic, but on par with Shadowrun:Crossfire. But I don't see that as a problem, as difficulty in coops is easy to tweak.

This is a great game to play on weekdays, since it plays quickly, is absorbing and brings out lots of tension. I clearly feel much better when I win at Ghost Stories than when I win at Pandemic.

This is really a great game. I'm fond of coop games for the most part and this is one of the best. The tension is non-stop and every turn seems to be crucial. This is also one of the most difficult coop games to win that I've come across. But the level of tension and difficulty are only part of why I like the game so much. Unlike most other solitaire games I think Ghost Stories has a lot of player interaction. Sometimes a players best option is to devote their turn to just helping another player. All of the players seem to need to constantly be coming up with ways to help each other out. I also like it that the game comes with multiple levels of difficulty and that it takes some playing to figure out how to use all the tiles and powers to their fullest. There is much more variety here than in other coop games. It certainly gives the game some very good replayability. The game also plays fairly quickly. The 60 minutes listed on the box is about right. 

The game is also quite good solo. You can play with either a single taoist or play multiple taoists. It's a great way to figure out how to effectively use many of the tiles and powers.

What can I say about this wonderful game? Co-op games seem to be the flavor of the week for designers and for members of my gaming group as well. I've played quite a few of them that have come out recently... Battlestar Galactica, Pandemic, Arkham Horror, Castle Panic. All of those games are certainly good and have some qualities that make them worth a play, but none of them have what I feel makes Ghost Stories a great game.

The amount of decision making in this game is superb. Some find it random because you are rolling dice to exorcise ghosts. I would think that those are the people that win this game even more rarely than I do. Luck is a small factor in this game compared to skill. The fact that this game can offer so many great decisions in such a short play time is wonderful for me! I can knock a game of this out in less than an hour! Usually all of those involved are willing to play again as well. The sense of satisfaction that you get when you win this game is great. It's certainly hard, it will certainly beat you down, but it's most certainly worth the purchase.

This is a super cooperative game. Players have to work together to stop the ghost of wu feng. You will find your team running around over the (random) board to stop the ghost from haunting the villagers and killing your monks.
If you like difficult coop´s, you have to have this.
The number of plays is incorrect. It is more like 30+ plays.

A little bit mechanical and repetitive, but fun nonetheless. The presentation is A-1 and the theme is well-integrated (for a Euro anyway).

Another co-op game that I have trouble getting into.  You are playing against a preset sequence of moves from the "opponent" and you come up with an optimum way to do your turn (as in all games).  The difference with coops is once you find an optimum way to conduct your turn, you can continue to use this method and the "opponent" will never react, will never change strategies, and the only way you can lose is due to poor dice rolls.

Played 1 solo play, 3 two way, and one 3 way in a single session back to back. That alone should speak to the quality of the game. Will have to revise my comment after further play, but my initial impression is that it is deliciously playtested to ensure maximum tension, we've come down to a (ineffective) showdown with wei feng each time, once losing because of running out of cards in the deck, once losing by rolling ONE less black die than needed. Hard to imagine beating it on the harder settings atm, but pandemic was the same way at first. Very interested in looking at the expansions for this as well.

Initial impression was that the dice rolling makes for both moments of incredible camaraderie (BLANK ON THE CURSE DIE!) and also reduces quarterbacking, because there is some element of chance in most things you do. Great game.

Great pure co-op game. Amazing artwork. Lots of interesting decisions for the players. The game flows well and is very intense and fun. I like the theme of shaolin monks fighting monsters. Each player has a unique ability but you must work together in order to survive. Maybe it suffers from the usual 'one person becomes the leader' problem. I cant tell from only 1 play.

This is a really fun co-op game but geez is it bloody hard to win.  

You play as Kung-Fu fighters defending a Chinese village from marauding ghosts, many of which are downright ugly.  Beautiful artwork and design, in particular the modular board.

Short, sharp moves with lots of competing decisions throughout.  The only criticism I would make is the iconography is not as intuitive as it could have been.  

Nonetheless this is still a great game and loads of fun even when you are being trounced by all those ghosts.

If you are into co-ops, this is a game worth considering.  Just be prepared to lose a LOT.

EDIT: The more I play this game the more I love it despite the difficulty.  Thematically the game just hangs together beautifully, there's always a level of frantic desperation and the game almost demands player must co-operate to survive.  Ticks lots of boxes for me.  Rating up from 7 to 8.5 and likely to go higher.

Captivating artwork, nice atmosphere and very challenging in 2-4 player games. Can also be played single player, but the game is a little bit easier that way.

There is quite a lot of rules, so this is not a party game. Also the rule book doesn't contain all the rules and I had to spend at least 8 hours on the internet to get all the rules straight - thanks to the Board Game Geek community for this!

It's a really difficult cooperative game, which may or may not be a good thing depending on what you're looking for, but ultimately it felt a lot like a puzzle in which you're constantly reacting to what's happening and tried and true playing patterns take over from interesting decision-making.

Very amusing coöp game, but not easy to master. Even the entry level game is very challeging, and you will surely lose some games. 
Although I really loved playing it, I also feel like you need a bit of luck with this game to win, especially when it comes to placing the tiles in the beginning. If the bhuda's are not in the corners for example, it will make the game more difficult than it is already.
Still, I really loved playing it.

This game is fun, please don't confuse my rating for a bad game or an average game.  I really enjoy this game.  The problem is that when I play it, I have to be in the right mood.  The game is like a logic puzzle.  When done, I feel tired and like I just been through a huge math test.  But am glad to have played.  I like logic puzzles and I like figuring out the next best move.  It is fun and I love the pieces but it is a game I just have to be in the right mood for.  If I am looking for a fun simple game, this is not it.  This is a game where I have to devote a lot of thought to.

Anyone familiar with the "Chinese Ghost Story" movies is probably going to love this game. You play Daoists defending a village against the onslaught of ghosts and demons, and that is one (pleasant) nightmare of a tricky business. Sometimes you stand a good chance and if you throw in your wits and work together as a team, you will beat the game, but there is no guarantee that everything will always be coming up roses...

I think the theme is just too dark (color-wise) for me.  There's two kinds of feelings inspired by co-ops where you have to keep things together as the world falls around you - either determination or despair, and this firmly falls into the 'despair' category for me.

RATING: 7.5
{5 plays • 3 & 4 player} Well, I know there are people out there winning at this game, but I'm 0-5 so far... and kind of enjoying it.  What's really nice is that we always feel like we're doing really well during the first half, and then things get hairy, but it still seems like we have a chance.

And then our asses get kicked :)

What's also nice here is that there are enough different options for any one player to do on their turn - many of them equally good (though maybe I'm not one to judge that, having never won) - and because of that, no single player has dominated play, as can often happen with cooperative games.  I'd like to think that no one I'd play with would do this anyway, but it's a plus that the game system also kinda prevents this.

Like most co-op games, I worry that once I win a few times, I'll lose interest.  Especially here, where I've never felt caught up in the theme - like in, say, Pandemic, or even better, Lord of the Rings.

Still, some nice, fresh ideas.  And a pretty nifty challenge.

RATING: 6
Yes it's a very good game. And yes it's difficult. And you try and you try and you try... And then one of 2 things (i've seen both) : 

-Victory never comes or too rarely, and you get bored.
-Or you find the way to beat it almost everytime, and after some plays that way you don't find interest in it anymore.

Maybe these 2 possibilities are the downside of all cooperative games.

A good game worth playing that I think one won't play for years and then maybe never touch it again. But if you like cooperative games, this is a must play.

RATING: 8.5
This game has always been kind of an enigma for me.  I don't play it all that often and it kicks my butt when I do.  So, I'm not sure why I like it so much, but I do.  Granted, I'm a fan of asian art stylings, which this has.  I like the simplicity of "guard the village", but love the fact each spot in the village gives you abilities.  I like the fact you can play this solo - which says a lot, I rarely ever play solo games (prefer human interaction).  But, there's just a cool thing happening here as the ghosts descend on the village and you have to priority plan where to take the hits and where not to.  I have only won this game once, but it felt like a million bucks as I took down the final boss.  If you haven't played this, the rules take a bit to sink in (what does this tao do again, can I execute this attack, etc), but it's worth it.  Side note, this definitely has a "Big Trouble In Little China" feel to it, and I was hoping someone would reskin that IP on this game (which now seems unlikely with the Legendary game that came out this past year).  But, one can dream.

When I saw this game I had to buy it.
The board (the center cards) are beautiful and so are the other components.
I bought also the White Moon expansion. And later I bought from the publisher web shop several promo cards and expansions and a set of special dice.
Yes it is true what is to read on BGG: this coop game is very hard and brutal against the players.
Played it only solitaire with 2 or 4 monks.
Some good and free expansion to get from [thing=123920]Crazy Shaman[/thing].

Seems like the ghosts have an advantage (which is a good thing in a co-op game).  Wasn't really that much to do, some ghosts are just too difficult to beat when you're already hurting, and when more than one comes up, it becomes VERY difficult to get back in good shape.

That's not really a knock against gameplay though- the game just wasn't too fun.  I'd play it again, but I didn't think it was all that great.

Again, I love Co-operative games and I think this will scratch the Oriental Ghost itch since I can't play "jade empire" anymore, Stupid Xbox breaking down!

Good news! I've bought Ghost stories and my Xbox is working again. Let the Ghost and Spirt fighting begin!

Whoa! This game is brutal, in th first couple of games we played some rules wrong which actually would have made things easier and we still got thumped. A win of this one is going to feel so good.

So far 2 wins! We must have done something wrong :)
Really enjoying the solo game with power tokens. Use the blue taoist and the guardhouse tile instead of the graveyard.

I traded this because whenever I played it I always felt like I should have just played Arkham Horror instead.

Well-designed, tactical cooperative game with challenging, tense decisions trying to maximize efficiency with special player powers and village tile bonuses. The decisions you make are very reactive due to the randomness of the ghost deck.

This seems really, really hard. Unlike many other cooperative games, there's no real sense of progress, and very little variety. The difficulty seems a little artificial. I'm just not as enthusiastic about the game as I once was.

Only 1 play so far, so it is very possible I am missing some traction on the depth.

This game does have a lot of layers and interacting machinery.  However, the chaos level just seems a little too high for that to really matter a whole lot, at least to 'win'.  You can certainly lose a game via bad play, but I am not sure you can often win a game via good play.  Just too much chance with respect to the control horizon.

Still, the immersion and theme is extremely good, and this is a very good immersion game.  It is fun even if you are certain you are going to lose.  There are lots of interesting decisions, which do in the end matter, even if it is just in buying more turns of gameplay.  

I would certainly play this again if it came to the table, but I am not going to buy it.

RATING: 7.5
A cooperative game for 1 to 4 players.

If you can win this game even on easy level you're probably messing up some rules because this game is almost impossible to win, even on easy and that's what makes it stupid. Instead of making a winnable game on easy level thus motivating players to raise it's dificulty, designers when for a completely frustrating experience making players lose every single time..

The game is hardest with 4 players, with 3, 2 and solo it gets increasingly easier, because you can use other monks abilities on your turn by the use of power tokens.

The taoist powers aren't balanced. But the worst thing is the luck in the dice, even though you're rolling dice you have to prepare for the bad rolls (you have to make sure you have enough tao tokens to exorcise ghosts, but while you're doing that ghosts are pilling up, and soon will be impossible to kill them at a decent pace). In this game a bad roll could cost you the game, because at the rate ghosts appear you can't afford to have a whole turn wasted by a bad dice roll.

It's quite frustating when the dice don't roll in your favor, you end up wasting a turn and not be able to eliminate any ghost (this has been just slightly improved with an artifact of the White Moon expansion). With the haunting ghosts moving forward every round it's irritating to have a whole turn wasted, sure you can sometimes use Tao tokens and maybe have the right Tao token on the Circle of Prayer tile but even that sometimes doesn't help.
You can't rely on the dice, but you have to be constantly rolling them.... Yeah...

When playing solo you can use the roll power of the green taoist, and the yellow taoist power to draw tao token in order to have enough tao tokens to exorcise ghosts. When playing alone the budas are especially useful to use on your own board to exorcise the more dificult black ghosts.

Rules poorly written, but there's a post on this site with the corrected rules.

Lastly, the difficulty level on this kills the fun of the game, next time do some real playtesting.

Played mostly on IOS.

Tipps:

- if the red player board is full, he lose a Qi but he does NOT draw a ghost. When your board is full you do not draw a ghost, you just lose a Qi.

Q : If I draw a ghost and place it on another player board, who is subjected to its effects?
A : The owner of the board is subjected to the effects of a ghost (Qi loss, inactivated power) 

Q : What happens when the Enfeeblement Mantra is placed on a ghost with a resistance of 1?
A : It will automatically be discarded when an exorcism is performed, it works like the 'Circle of Prayer'. It is never discarded immediately

Q : If the 'Circle of Prayer' tile is haunted, what happens if a tao token is present?
A : The tao token is put back to the reserve

beautiful art.
Fantastic Game.
Easily the best co-op I've EVER played.

Notes for review:
The trick with Ghost Stories is, you don't know what KIND of game you are going to get. In most cases, yes, you use all of the main ghosts (and a random selection of one or more boss ghosts depending on difficulty). The villages are the same, but in different locations each time so you can't optimize which village to hit because you don't know where it will be.

The ghost ordering determines the speed of the game and complexity (outside of the selected challenge level). For example, you could get a series of tough to kill ghosts then a handful of ghosts that trash your resources and you get totally hosed unless you play perfectly. You could get a series of ghosts which spawn new ghosts filling up all the boards. You could get tough haunters which swamp the players on opposite corners of the boards. Or you could get a serious of wimpy ghosts that pop like zits when you stare at them.

Being able to work in different flows is very important to this game and should not be ignored. I've found having several people watching and coaching during the game really helps. The game is VERY difficult to play perfectly, but when everyone plays a strategy right you can pull out a win in even the most dire circumstances.

There is truth that the game has a huge luck factor. I spent a whole game never being able to kill a black ghost. My failure was in not hedging against that by collecting the black tokens. Wise use of resources can mitigate most of the luck in this game.

As far as the limited variable powers, sure, there are only 8 powers with four in play, but the magic isn't in what one player can do...it's about combos. What is the most awesome combo you can pull off with the abilities you are given. And moreover, the order they go on makes a huge difference. Some combos can't be used if the colors are in the wrong order.

The game is a lot deeper than people give it credit for. Many will dismiss it as luck, but the reality is, this is one of the toughest strategy games out there.

I do wish they'd given you an extra dice though...

Jó kis kooperatív játék szellemek ellen. Elég nehéz megnyerni, és ha nincs szerencsénk, gyorsan véget tud érni:) Egyedi, jól ki van találva. Még játszanék vele, de a téma annyira nem fogott meg, hogy meg is vegyem.

Tough to beat game (especially if you take into account a few mistakes that you might do in first runs, I know I did!!!). The fact that you need 4 players ideally has its downside (you insert dummy players for what you lack). The usual 'should we do that or maybe this instead..or maybe...??' talk takes most of the time in the game, hence a good vibe of the team is necessary but the 'shepherd-them-all' player effect is not avoided. That doesn't stop this game for being fun for the coop fans at least.

Nem vagyok a kooperativ jatekok rajongoja, de ez a jatek nagyon tetszett. (ennek - no meg a Pandemic - hatasara kicsit kezdem atertekelni ezt a stilust)
A jatek kivitelezese nagyon igenyes, es mellesleg gyonyoru. A kartyak, a helyseglapkak, a figurak - mind-mind jatszasra "kenyszeritik" a jatekosokat.
Elagansok a szabalyok, es sok cselekvesi lehetoseg illuziot ad arra, hogy megmentheto a falu a szellemektol... A tobbfele jatszhatosagi szint pedig boven gondoskodik arrol, hogy a jatek sokaig kihivast jelentsen.
Kezdo jatekosokkal is kiserletet tehetunk a falu megmentesere, mert a szabalyok vilagosak es konnyen magyarazhatoak / erthetoek.
Ha mar rauntunk az egymas elleni kuzdelmekre, vegyuk elo ezt a dobozt es kovessuk a jelmondatot - "egysegben az ero...!". Meg egy esetleges vereseg eseten is jol fogunk szorakozni. Megitelesem szerint akar tobb parti is kovetheti egymast.

Ghost Stories..... What an interesting game. It is probably the game where the gameplay scales the best. It is great as a solitaire as well as with other players. 

Rules and Gameplay are fairly simple but it takes some time to fully understand the Iconography. But you should get it all right after 2-3 plays.

Quality is ok but a far cry from outstanding. I think the best items in the game are the Ghost tokens. The Cards, Board Game tiles and player boards are of mediocre quality.
However, this is not an overly expensive game and the quality is good enough for this kind of game.


The Gameplay is fast paced and absolutely relentless. A round consist of Moving your Token, perform an Action (attack or requesting help) moving Enemy Tokens and drawing a Ghost card.

Now, you will NEVER draw a good card from the Ghost deck. It will always be bad. The card you draw only ranges from bad to very bad.

You also only have 2 rounds to kill a haunting ghost after you drew it or you will loose one of your 9 Village tiles.

It is pure stress. Everything can change at any given time and no one game will be the same.


I found that winning this game is VERY satisfactory. I makes me feel I actually achieved something. In my opinion, this is a great game.

If you enjoy games that will put you constantly under pressure and plays fantastically with all player counts (1-4) than this game should be in your collection.

Ghost Stories is the first successful design of renowned author Antoine Bauza.

It is a full coop game about defending a chinese village from hordes of ghosts and the incarnations of Wu-Feng (an all powerful necromantic badass) trying to come back from the grave. One to four Taoist monks use their Kung fu to stop Wu-Feng and save the world...
This is more easily said than done, because the game is quite hard, even at the first (out of four) level of difficulty.

The rules are more convoluted and less elegant than those other popular coops (i.e. Pandemic) and the rulebook is not among the best, but after a three or four turns of the first game, everything clicks and gameplay flows smoothly.

The game is a giant, brain-hurting puzzle, and obviously suffers from the "leading/charismatic/experienced player dominating others" syndrome like many other coops. But it is nevertheless quite enjoyable, and also quite thematic.

Rating would probably be even higher if I'd enjoy coops more.

Bauza's talents as a designer are confirmed once more.

I like this because you use a euro style engine that mitigates the luck involved in the dice rolling. Preferred playing it without the expansion. Can be hard to beat. Still suffers from the usual coop could be played solo.

RATING: 8
Unique, visually striking cooperative game by a designer with numerous strong games under his belt. The theme comes through in the sense that you feel the pressure of the situation being depicted, but don't expect "stories" of any significance to be told. It's a solid, unrelenting, somewhat abstract combat game with plenty of tactical decisions, and a high replayability factor that's not dependant on new content.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Kick you in the balls tough.  It's a co-op and about as brutal a game as you can play.  I enjoy playing this one solo.  A lot of luck involved, but the game gives you ways to work around it and manage it.  Really is a challenge.  Players can expect to lose more often than not.

One of the most beautiful looking games in my collection.

El juego es sencillo, saltar de loseta en loseta para conseguir matar a los fantasmas y reactivar aquel los pueblerinos que han sucumbido a los fantasmas.

I've played it only couple of times. For me it's too random. Sometimes it's just too easy and boring, and sometimes player has no chance to survive. Dice throwing destroys this game.

Purchased while it was on clearance at Books-A-Million. Couldn't resist for $8. The game has beautiful art and components. It's pretty easy to setup as well. It isn't a deep game, but it is an enjoyable puzzle. Somewhat like Pandemic, depending on how the cards come out, you may not have a chance to win. It works well as a solo game and a multiplayer cooperative game.

Really awesome, and genuinely frightening, co-op game where players are Taoist monks trying to defend their village against an onslaught of ghosts, brought to life by the vengeful spirit of Wu Feng! The game is incredibly unforgiving, but I don't find that to be a detriment to the gameplay. It presents itself as an extremely tricky puzzle. One that is difficult, but can be solved with practice. This is exactly what I want in a co-op. There is a lot of discussion and less of an alpha gamer problem.

Once you know the strategy, it is fun to watch others who don't know the strategy discovery the game.  I am not an alpha player, and I enjoy being taken down because of a few bad decisions as newer players often want to play immediately to win the game.

My first cooperative game. Incredibly fun to play. Provides a real challenge. There are ways to make it easier though by choosing what powers to use instead of assigning them randomly. Also the guardhouse promo tile makes the game a bit easier.

If you're into cooperative games but feel that they're a bit too easy, this is the game for you. At first everything seems hunky dory -- exorcise a ghost here, a ghost there, stock up on some extra Tao tokens, fine -- but then the ectoplasm hits the fan. Before you can say "not the curse die again!" the air is thick with angry spirits and the village is overrrun and haunted. It's quite "puzzley" and very unforgiving, so move optimisation is key. Whether that appeals probably depends on the players.

In the current craze of coop games this one has no problem standing out. The eyecatching beautiful artwork makes you want to play the game instantly. The gameplay itself is so smooth and full of action you won't know what hit you after you started. The sense of urgency you feel and the level of cooporation this game requires have not been seen before. But still it is fun! This game will have you chanting for the last positive dice result and cheering when it actually comes. And if you lose..., well you'll feel very dark inside and demand an immediate rematch.

A very good tower defense style game that always forces you to make the best decisions so as to not be overrun; however I have also found that the game at times just beats you due to bad card draws/poor die rolls and you simply can't recover.

So far I've only tested this out as a solo game, but it seems like a really nice and unique game design.  I'm sure some of the ways that a solo player can become overwhelmed will be reduced with help from others, so I look forward to trying the multiplayer game.  Probably my favorite part of the game design are the multiple ways that players can mitigate the luck of the die rolls.  It makes for a real strategic feel despite the luck of the dice and card draws.

I like co-op games.  I like them to be hard and have some meat to them.  This one rocks. Even the easy setting isn't all that easy.  Players live and die by cooperation, and on top of that, it uses it's theme very, very well.  Cannot wait til the expansion comes out.

Got this as a birthday present just played my first game. Wow it is so good. So intense and strategic. I'd heard it was meant to be hard and expected us to lose our first game, but we actually managed to win. albeit by the skin of pur teeth. It seemed fitting that one of us had to sarafice ourselves on the last round in order to take out wu feng and actually win. And it all came down to 1 last dice roll which was make or break time. It was so brilliantly tense. And the theme is great I can't think of a game other than pandemic legacy that has gripped me as Much as this game.

Man, this game is absurdly hard! Even the initial level is so difficult I almost cried! Rules are WAY WAY WAY badly written and extremely confusing. You will mostly have to rely on the tutorials to learn how the game play. By all mean this is a very intriguing game that I love. So many things have to be done, full of tension. I don't know whether I love this game better than Yggdrasil or not, although I think the gameplay of Yggdrasil is more streamlined.

How I love the final incarnation. Just like the final blow to make you collasp & burst out of tears.

I love the fact this game feels like an ongoing struggle! Squeaking out is SO satisfying every time.

I do think there's a way to sort of figure out the base game so that you mostly win as a 1-2 player game but the White Moon Expansion really does well with adding more great options to do in any given turn while at the same balancing the difficulty more so. Sure the devourers will ruin your day real quick, but kung fu school and saving the right items will really make the game feel epic instead of hopeless if your having bad rolls and card draws

I'll play this game at any player count but if you have an alpha player, it's not that great of a time. And it's this reason why it isn't rated higher for me.

We have games about ancient rural settlements in China, about ancient civilizations in China, about ancient railways in China but we still had no game about ancient monks fighting horrors in China: now we have and any fan of Chinese wuxia or B-movies should rejoice about Ghost Stories, which has a pretty misleading title because, although there’s plenty of ghosts and other nightmarish creatures, there’s no story to be told but the endless and respiteless struggle of your taoist monks working together to keep hordes of monsters at bay.

A somewhat tough task, since there are just too many of them and too few of you: nonetheless, if you manage to look beyond the clumsy and fiddly rules and start caring for the theme (supported by astounding comics-like pieces of art), you could even enjoy it.
Provided you manage to survive.

RATING: 3
Over the years Ghost Stories has become one of the stalwarts of the Co-op genre.  It's well known for it's brutal difficulty.  It's very much an intense puzzle, where you need to assess the situation and successfully remove the biggest threat.  Great artwork and components...but the game is utterly themeless.  It could really be about anything.  I still enjoy it though.

RATING: 8.5
I've not beaten it yet without White Moon but I still love this game! Some of my friends, however, don't seem so keen and tend to groan when I suggest playing it. As a result it hasn't seen as much table time as I'd like, which means I'm less likely to figure out a good system for winning as I keep forgetting so much in between plays. Therein lies the paradox... And Wu Feng has already won.

Sadly, the frustratingly large amount of ambiguous rules questions stops Ghost Stories from reaching true excellence.

RATING: 9
This is a good one. Gameplay is fast and frantic, hard to believe how quickly a seemingly sound position can go West. Not as much theme as, say, Arkham Horror but plays in a much shorter time and has that undefinable "lets try just one more time" quality. On the hardest difficulty setting completly unforgiving, love it.

RATING: 5
I've played many cooperative games, and among those I've played, Ghost Stories is a good game but one of my less-favourite ones.  Pluses and minuses:

+ The cooperation is strong.  A lot more teamwork than in the others I've played, lots of teaming up to accomplish short-term tasks.  Good stuff.

+ Mechanistically, it's one of the best-playing co-ops I've played.  Interesting decisions and room for planning.

- Really only playable with exactly 4 players.  The special rules for handling fewer players are non-intuitive and I don't want to teach the game's special rules to accommodate non-optimum number of players.

- Everything you've heard about high difficulty is true.  I gave everyone five Qi, and threw in some forgiving house rules (like ghosts that draw other ghosts don't cascade past the second) and we still got our asses handed to us such that it felt like we didn't stand a chance.

I want to elaborate on this last point.  Of course everyone wants a challenging co-op, but it should still feel possible.  In this game, one bad choice can throw the game, and you need to be extremely lucky just to have a chance (then still lose from a bad die roll on the final boss).

The most frustrating thing is that in this game, more than any other, you can see two-thirds through the game with stunning clarity that you have already lost... then you have to play another 20 minutes.  When all boards are full, you can lose life, you can un-haunt tiles, to delay losing the game outright... but with no new ghosts coming in, you're no closer to [u]winning[/u] the game either, so all you're doing is delaying the inevitable.  Wheeee!

It's ridiculously hard such that you need extreme luck to give yourself the chance that more extreme luck will get you to the bad guy so you have the extreme lucky chance of finishing him.  The mechanisms are a way to use your brain to keep from losing, but you can only win with laughably long lucky streaks.

Some people say you need to play the game a dozen times before you have a chance...  Okay, sure, but how can I introduce this game to new players and tell them, we're definitely going to lose our first several games?  Who would want to even bother learning?  Let's take it for granted we've lost and play something else instead.

Having played most of the prominent cooperative games, Ghost Stories was one of the more entertaining ones.  However, it suffers the common flaw of lack of narrative.  The entire game is you killing ghosts and the fundamentals of that activity don't really change.  And the tension doesn't really ramp up, it's not like the number of ghosts or their difficulty slowly creeps up as the game progresses.

My other problem are the player powers.  The options within and among the colors often diverge wildly in power and certain ones (like the double action blue power) encourage really boring strategies like sitting on the Buddha.

That said, Ghost Stories takes a spot right behind LotR and Pandemic in my estimation of cooperative games.

Just played it with the final components, they add a lot of chrome to the game. (Someone even came to the table saying "this looks so nice, I want to try it".) This cooperative game really keeps you at the edge of your seat, especially when a big boss arrives. And I found it very very cooperative: one player was trying to play for himself at the beginning, and we lost the first game badly. Lesson learned, we managed to win the second time.

Oh, and it plays fast: clearly less than 1 hour. I'll definitely play again.

We have tried to get this game to the table on multiple occasions but always found it too frustrating and gave up before turn 1. The setup instructions are not very clear (we utilized a You Tube video to set up our two player game after being unable to figure it out). The instructions do not get much clearer after that.

I'm leaving this until I'm able to successfully play a game. I will probably pull the box out once my 9-5 job calms down. However, right now, it is not worth the work to try and figure out.

Overall Ratings:

Instructions: 3/10 The book is high quality but useless. It does not tell you what is what, and the instructions it does give are pretty useless. I recommend You Tube to learn more.

Ease of Play: 0/10 In two sessions, I have yet to take a turn.

Components: 5/10 Painted miniatures might help but overall the pieces are average.

Replay Value: 0/10 I may adjust this if I'm ever able to get it back to the table. 

Overall: 2/10

Probably one of the best cooperative games out there.  Would play this any time with any group (and have played it alone).  One... potential problem is that it doesn't scale perfectly with the number of players.  For instance, 1 player games (with 3 neutral power tokens) is much easier for me than 2 player games.  As a thematic gamer, I highly recommend the White Moon expansion (saving villagers FTW!).

I need to play this more times to feel like the rating is fair. This is a very challenging solo/cooperative game. It has what seems to be a lively theme but the "impossible puzzle" element of the game is so much in the foreground always that I don't feel like I have enough oxygen while playing the game to be able to enjoy the theme. This is a real brain burner of a game and I'm not sure I like that when sometimes, because of the fall of the cards, the puzzle that you're wrestling with may not, in fact, be solvable. Arkham Horror might present that possibility, but the theme is so immersive and wed to the mechanics that the story of that game more than compensates for a "loss." Its design is absolutely elegant and praiseworthy, but it's more a math problem than a narrative for me.

Update: Oh, my goodness. The iPad has helped me get a grip on this game. This is really a profound and evil game! I've only won on Initiate while ordering the tiles as I saw fit, but I am committed to beating this thing on Normal with random distribution. This is something special. The rating is up to an eight.

RATING: 3
"What does this icon do again?" A simple game mechanic, but too many side cases you could get wrong, so you need a go through the rulebook again every effing time, and on top of that, a dozen special-case rules for all the locations and players, explained by cryptic iconography. To me, it's a waste of brain cells to try and remember them, but then, without minmaxing those special-case rules, you have no chance of winning.

Great coop-Game here, with beautiful art work. After one game I can say it tops the strong pandemic.
At all it seems tougher to win as in pandemic. 
The turns of the players are short and can be summarized as: 
Draw a ghost card, place it on one players board, use a village action or banish a ghost card and at last, if you have a buddha figure, place it optinonally on a empty ghost card space in front of you Monk (if a card is placed on a space with a buddha the card will be effectless discarded, which is great). 

There are a lot of small decions, e.g  where to place the ghost cards, which village actions should be used etc. But most important is the permanent time-pressure, will you go to banish the most threatening ghost but the tougher one, or a weaker but easier to defeat one. Or is it better to invest an action to use the help of the village people e.g. take one or mores precious Tao-Tiles. In the end also good dice rolls are needed to win, but that’s fine for me.

I really like this game, but I can only give it a 7 because it is so relentlessly difficult that it's almost required you modify a few of the rules before it's any fun.
I enjoy soul crushingly difficult cooperative gaming experiences, like Shadows Over Camelot and Eldritch Horror, but Ghost Stories is almost over-the-top in its level of challenge.
To make the game a little more manageable, me and my wife delay the haunters so they're haunting once every three turns instead of once every two turns, we strategically place the villages rather than doing so randomly, and we try to roll the curse die on an axis so that it's more likely to land on one of the empty squares. Without those three very simple modifications, this game's difficulty is so relentless it's not even fun. 
I really like Ghost Stories, and it's really great for those who love getting brutally raped by a game that loathes its players' existence for having the audacity to open its packaging, but the challenge is overwhelming at the easiest difficulty settings if you don't slightly modify the rules.

RATING: 7.8
Nice cooperative game prettily done.

Asmodee as usual, throws a ton of color into this game.  The rules as usualy are tricky...(not complicated just a lot of variations as to what each :"taoist" can do and what each village tile can do.

It is really important to keep taoists working corners as they can potentially play more slop to their advantage and also sometimes hit two tiles at the same time.

Fun game...Complicated enough to win to make it a nice challenge.

May be my favorite co-op without a traitor.  It's a puzzle with enough luck to make lots of the options potentially viable.  Only problem is, I feel like half the games I lose, I lose regardless of the decisions made during the game.  But that just adds to the fun for me.

I still haven't decided if I like this game or not.  It is a much quicker cooperative kill the monster game than Arkham Horror.  However, where AH develops a depth of story, this game just feels like you are doing the same thing over and over.  I'm beginning to feel like the new-game sheen is rubbing off this game and it may start getting less plays.

Adult Play = 7; Solo Play = 7

I walked away from it for a few months and have recently started playing it again (actually at my nephew's urging).  While I still don't think it has the depth of AH, there is more depth than I initially realized.  Trying to get the balance of villager resources to exorcisms is a tough balance to get and I'm still working on it.  Also getting the balance keeps this game from being as repetitive as I originally thought.  The other thing I like about it over other cooperatives is that there is enough going on that it is hard to have one player dominate it.

Adult Play = 8  Solo Play = 8

Over a year later, this game is harder than any other solo game I play.  I don't pull it out often (cause 1) I get bored of losing and 2) I'm playing mathy games now) but I still rate this game very highly.

Initiation level losses with 4 of us learning the ropes, getting familiar with the village tiles and how to most effectively combat the persistent ghost threat. Like the variety of gameplay with the double sided playing boards. Several actions to select from among the nine villagers, but plays relatively smoothly. Moves quickly, with just over an hour of play time. I think the rating will go up with further plays. UPDATE: Raised to a 9 with further plays revealing the important tactical uses of each village tile. We're playing Normal and Nightmare Levels now due to the advanced experience, after playing 5 games on Initiation Level. UPDATE: Finally beat Hell level with 2 players. Seems harder with 3 or 4 to win at this and the Nightmare levels.

Before I play that game I hate it from the bottom of my heart, because I know it will leave me exhausted afterwards.
But when the game is over I really like it. I like it FOR that feeling.
The game is so tense...and so hard... Every move might be the last one. Not like Pandemic where, at some point, you can calculate how deadly the next turn might be. No. Here you have random cards, random dice. Random evilness, random death.
Once you beat it (we have won two out of 9 games) you feel like you could save the whole world.
Off to glory!

Ghost Stories is hard, but not as hard as people on the 'geek claim.  Personally I feel like this is the most consistently winnable co-op we own - even if luck does not go your way, you feel like there is a plan of attack and definite tactics that work.  Amazing art and components, and truly addictive action, this is a lot of fun.  This is the closest to a video game feel I've seen replicated in a board game (then again, I haven't played Doom or other easy contenders, so maybe my perspective is off.  Small World feels very video-game like to me too).  Asmodee's components are outstanding - just don't riffle shuffle the cards, they mark easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Challenging and fun co-op. Like Defenders of the Realm, the game does sometimes suffer from a too-heavy reliance on dice rolls, but the theme and artwork make up for it. I wish the "easy" version were a little easier, because I still haven't won.

UPDATE: Too hard and luck-based. I don't understand the appeal of playing a game where you continually lose due to bad rolls.

RATING: 7
A truly horrible rulebook, but an interesting game.  I'm looking forward to playing this more, but I would recommend to anyone who's going to play this game, to read up on all the rules here on the geek, so maybe you'll play it correctly one of your first few times.

An excellent cooperative game.  It seems like you need to be everywhere at once.  It may seem impossible to win, but we've done it on a couple occasions.  I would guess we win about 20% of the time.  That's enough to keep us coming back for more abuse.

Was interesting the first few plays but fell flat quickly after that.  There are a couple of elements to the game that lead me to rate it low.  The first is that the difficulty varies widely depending on how the ghosts show up.  The haunters in particular are difficult to deal with if several come out at once on different boards.  The second element is that dice rolls are too critical to winning.  A few bad rolls in a row can quickly make the game a loss.  I'll play Ghost Stories if someone wants to, but it is not one of my favorites.

Coop game.

Pros: 
Challenging
Good components and artwork
Good theme
Stressful
Easy to learn

Cons:
I feel like those bad rice puns are racist. If you want to appropriate a culture for making your game, at least respect the people you are taking from instead of reducing them to... rice -_- 
There's a lot of luck involved. Can be quite frustrating when you are unlucky with dice rolls.

Note: 
When I play solo, I play 4 characters instead of doing that whole neutral board thing.

1 play with my wife. It was alright. Die rolls as usual play a big part in the game but yes, if you play well, you should generally win and if you play poorly, you will definitely lose. Theme doesn't appeal to us and in an age of more and more interesting co-ops, this will probably fall by the wayside.

You think everything is going fine, and then...bam! The board is overrun, your taoists are losing health, and you're losing every dice roll. Painful.

Our first game was a little too long (1.5 hours), and it's hard to keep in mind all the village tile powers [i]and[/i] each taoist's special powers, leading to some mental overload of options. But the board is pretty and the game itself is a nice little puzzle. Gives good fodder for thinking.

Unfortunately I don't think my wife enjoys cooperative games.

All right, I'm kicking it back up to a 7. I still enjoy this one from time to time. It's not hard to wish it were better, mainly because it's too easy to get into a death spiral and a lost game well before the game is over, but it's clever and fun and the players have lots of options. Maybe in 5-10 years we'll get an updated version that breaks it up into acts or something along those lines to tighten it up a bit.
--
OK, I think the rating settles at a 6. Interestingly, it was not the play-balance that caused me to lose interest, but really the lack of a good narrative arc. It's just a bunch of random stuff happening, then the boss showing up.  Eh. It was fun for a while, but I'm back to a spot where I'd just much rather play Pandemic or Lord of the Rings.
---
Lowered my rating solely due to ludicrous difficulty level and terrible rules. The extreme difficulty just makes the game too frustrating. Something is badly out-of-kilter in that respect. Even if that were corrected, I'm not sure there is a ton of game here. A lot of ambiance, yes, and some fun, yes, but the chaos level is high and players frequently don't have a lot of choices and too often get backed against a wall for too long.

I do like the game, and hope to find a tweak that will reign in the difficulty (most of the Taoists have one obviously superior side, for example, and two players is a lot easier than 4, with the right Taoists). But as it is, interest is fading.
---
Man, this game seems tough. We're getting hammered repeatedly just on Initiation. There is a lot of luck, so maybe we've just been unlucky, but it seems like the game might be really hard too.
---
I do like this game, but the rules are a little wonky - not as clear as they could be on a couple key points (can you reduce a Ghost's resistance to 0? What does that mean? And does using your Yin-Yang token to activate a building count as your one activation, or is it a bonus?). Probably a little over-complicated for what it gets you, but still, on balance, I've been having a lot of fun with it.
---
First impressions are very favorable; it's another nice co-op to put beside Pandemic and Lord of the Rings. It doesn't quite have the elegance of those games, and the difficulty level is a little uneven due to big variances in how the ghosts come out and in the final showdown, but it's still fun and very nicely produced. Difficulty and complexity-wise, it's probably somewhere between those two games, probably a little closer to Lord of the Rings.

Yet another cool co-op game in the recent rash of the genre!  In my one play so far, we were never in real danger of losing as everything seemed to go as well as you could possibly hope for.  However, I can see how the game could get very tense as things certainly have the potential to get out of hand very quickly.  Quite a few options available every turn, but it generally boils down to choosing between 2 or 3 pretty obvious choices.  Overall, a pretty nifty game that has a great theme for people that care about that sort of thing!

I felt like my character was trapped in quicksand while being set upon by a legion of hornets. The ratio of bad-guy-moves to good-guy-moves is so high that it feels like player choices are completely ineffectual (unless you get really lucky with your rolls). Experienced players can master the system and beat it, I've heard. However, for me it just didn't feel fun enough to put in the effort.

RATING: 10
Individual powers and pawns are key to making each player feel like they are personally playing a game and not some kind of group solitaire, although the red powers are disappointingly dull compared to the other three colours.

The scaling difficulty is great because the game is really really difficult when you first learn how to play. Even now I still don't play on Hell level.

I love that you can gamble and hope to roll well to exorcise a ghost, but that really the dice should be used to minimise how much you'll be paying. It's completely counter-intuitive, but it's required in order to do well at the game.

Between the changing of the layout of the village, the different powers available per colour, the different Wu-Fengs, and the variety of ghosts (not all of which you'll face in every game), the game feels fresh every time.

Due to the rapid rate at which ghosts are spawned, plans rarely go further than two turns into the future.

The rules for how to play with less than four are great. They flow well and they don't feel tacked on.

I love that the box cover features a man and a woman, although I would have liked to see that reflected in the pawns as well (the pawns are all male). 

I like how there are women on the town tiles, although I would have liked to have seen more of them.

I shouldn't have to say the following, but will due to the sorry state of affairs in board games:

I like that there are no white people in this game because they would be out of place. But I've come to expect white people in all games because apparently companies believe that white people won't buy games without white people in them, but non-white people will buy games without non-white people in them.

I love that the people are not caricatures, which is so often the case for European/American games.

I love that they didn't use the Ching Chong font, a staple of Europeans and Americans who want to show Asianess (like when those say Europeans and Americans pull on the corners of their eyes and says ching chang chong to show Asianess).

Yes, I long for the day when I don't praise a game for being not racist.

Most good co-op games have a fun puzzley feeling to them, and I find Ghost Stories particiularly enthralling in this regard. The village tiles are a pretty simple way to obscure optimal plays, making it feel especially puzzley and replayable. There's usually a number of ways to deal with any given situation - mostly to do with which tiles you're going to make use of in which order - and so usually when you lose it feels like you should have made other choices, which, I think, is key to replayability.

Now, it's true there are dice and there is a lot of luck in this game. More than Pandemic? Probably, or at least it feels more unforgiving, but honestly the dice are the least of your worries here. Optimal plays generally involve either increasing your odds of success before even attempting a roll, or bypassing rolling entirely, so losing due to poor rolls is actually somewhat rare amongst seasoned players (though obviously, it can happen, but usually a lost roll just increases the tension and stakes rather than ends the game).

What feels more random are the ways monsters can combo together in sudden and unexpected ways. I'm sure if you play enough of this you learn what to account for when assessing threats, but because of the ways ghosts can combo just figuring out where your high risk areas even are is much harder here than in Pandemic, which has a lot more known information.

Do you need this if you have other co-op games? I'm gonna go with ...maybe? Probably? In my opinion, this is one of the better ones, so if for whatever reason you want a new co-op adventure, I highly recommend it. There's lots of fun options, loads of tension, a good difficulty level, and the theme and art (well, on the tiles - the cards are more hit-or-miss) are pretty groovy. Pandemic would probably still be my go-to as an intro to the genre, though, because of the excellent expansion options to extend longevity and overall simplicity of rules. I have about equal fun with base game Pandemic and Ghost Stories, but there's lots of little rules to remember, especially during setup, in Ghost Stories that it's harder to just pull out when you've not played in awhile.

Be warned, however, that the rulebook for this game is terrible. I have the first version so maybe it's been cleaned up by now... but not only are things vaguely worded, but poorly organized (especially if you're playing with 2-3 players instead of 4). The rules themselves feel a little daunting at first just given that there's so many little tokens and rules, etc., but thankfully quickly become second nature. AND this is one of the very few games I will praise for its iconography - there's few enough symbols and they're generally clear enough that they're actually understandable even during your first game and speed things up thereafter, rather than just add unnecessary confusion. A+ on those, really and truly.

[u]February 2010:[/u] Just bought

[u]March 2010:[/u] I like it a lot better than Pandemic, it is a LOT harder, we won on initiation mode for the first time at ur 5th play! And that's because luck was on our side! The game is very very challenging, and I expect it to be for quite a long time too. The artwork is gorgeous too and really adds a lot. There is a lot of luck, but I suspect that once we know how to play better we'll realize that there is good ways to mitigate it a lot. Right now, I think take our chances to often and I'm not sure this is the way to win. Sure luck is everywhere here but the game provides you with tons of ways to control it (give the black dice to the green player by moving ghosts around, get the buddhas on the board to avoird too dangerous ghosts, get tokens for your battles...), it is just very hard to use them all right.
Right now, I'm having tons of fun with this game.

RATING: 8.5
This is by far the best co-op I’ve ever played! Sure, I haven't played every co-op, but I have played all the popular games like Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Defenders of the Realm, Yggdrasil etc, but this game really is the clear #1 imo! 

It’s so intense and just a pleasure to play! I’m not a big fan of theme and game components, it doesn’t really matter that much to me, but this game has a cool theme and WONDERFUL components and artwork! 

You can only do ONE thing on your turn, but you want to do SO much stuff, so it’s quite frustrating – in a good way! There is much to think about each turn (though it's not prone to AP at all) because you want to do a lot but aren't able to do it as the monsters quickly swarm you! It might start out to be easy, but later in the game it turns out to be really hard. Lots of different monster abilities, different player abilities, different village tile abilities etc. Finally, the gorgeous artwork helps to attract new players and also keeps the experienced players around.

Also, I haven’t seen the “experienced-player-tells-everybody-else-what-to-do” syndrome which can occur in Pandemic and other games. Maybe it’s just me, but it might be because in Pandemic there are usually one or two optimal moves, whereas in Ghost Stories there might be better moves than others, but it’s not like there is THE right move. So everybody can discuss what to do.

I’ve played my fair share of pure co-ops and semi co-ops with many different groups, and this is by far the favorite for me and everybody I’ve played with. Finally, this game has two GREAT expansions which really make the game feel totally different depending on which expansion you use. It means that GS can be played in 4 totally different ways if you want, but I actually prefer the base game on its own.

I want my co-ops to be hard to beat and I want to gasp for breath, and Ghost Stories really gives me that feeling! The difficulty of this game (and the ability to make the game really hard by playing on hell difficulty...) along with two great expansions make this game a winner for me!

Highly unusual theme with each character having a special power. Sounds great but is actually slow and dull and feels like puzzle-solving by committee. This co-op is even less fun than Arkham Horror and way more abstract. I've suffered through this twice now and that's enough.

I and three other rookies won our first ever game. A skilled observer (with faq who advised us on the rules if we were doing something wrong) said we made only a few tactical mistakes. Any game I can pick up and play like that is kind of a good game to me. I don't choose to play it a lot but I do like it when I do play, despite the fact I'm not good at it, I usually solo it, and that I expect I'll lose. Unlike Arkham Horror, I don't think that losing is such an annoyance, probably from shorter games and less setup time.

After beating the game on Nightmare the game has lost a little luster and is a little repetitive. I have played the solo scenario mainly, and I like it.

I have yet to actually play this game because the instructions are so complicated and confusing.  It's listed as 1-4 players, so I picked it up to play on my own, but I can't figure out the 1-player instructions and haven't yet been able to gather a 4-player group to play it.  It looks and seems like it will be a good game, but getting to the actual gameplay is proving to be a challenge.

Edit: I finally got around to trying this game.  It's definitely a fun game and a very challenging one.  I highly recommend, however, that you actually have four people to play.

The game is a co-op game and is extremely challenging.  I recommend it for fans of co-op games, but use an online tutorial video to understand it.

A fun co-op that really has all players trying to get the most of their turns before the game completely demolishes you.  The haunters and the dice killer ghosts are brutal!  The game does come at you with two randomizers in cards and dice (and I normally hate this combination), but the game also gives you a way to mitigate that randomness in the form of action spaces and tokens.  I think this game strikes a good balance between random and controlling your outcome.  I don't completely understand why the game has an eastern theme on top of a ghost theme; I think it would appeal more if the characters were just tokens and not samurai.

I like the look, the setting, the challenge.  This game is damn hard.

Well we've finally beat it, and it feels great.  Really beat it this time, not beat it after rerolling a dice that was inconveniently cocked.  This game is attractive and fun to have around, and in our sessions at least there is no (or not much) leader-boss problem.  Generally everyone's turn is discussed committee-like constantly.  The game is still a struggle and I look forward to playing again with some increased difficulty or expansion (Guardhouse) but generally I'm getting a bit tired, as it seems like games tend to play out very similarly.

So, I had this on my wishlist largely because of the promise of playing this game solo. The only other game I ever played that got serious solo play was Pandemic. And in fact, I played that game so much solo that it made playing a pure collaborative game a bit excruciating with other people.

So... back to Ghost Stories. Wow. This is tough. Which means, it is a significant challenge to keep me interested. I like the feeling of being surrounded by all these threats. Where Pandemic was very calculating, Ghost Stories offers a bit more luck with the die rolls. I like the game so far, and I'll certainly be playing this some more. It's legit as a solo option.

I don't really much like playing Ghost Stories.
It's a cooperative game and at some level similar to Pandemic, but I like theme of Pandemic more and I don't like rolling dice because I often have bad luck. I prefer other methods of including randomness to a board game than rolling dice.  
That's why I rated Ghost Stories one point less than Pandemic.

Ghost Stories es un juego que me encanta, más en solitario que a nivel cooperativo, pues para cuatro jugadores hay mejores alternativas. Como ya he dicho no me fascinan los juegos cooperativos pero este es uno de los pocos que no me disgusta jugarlo y me encanta el sentimiento que se te queda cuando ganas una partida. Juego para tener en la ludoteca y que además puedes jugar con todo el mundo. Se arman buenas discusiones y estas metido en el juego durante toda la partida, no dando lugar a analisis/paralisis. .

Picked this one up with a Christmas gift certificate from my FLGS.  Finally managed to give it a solo play to figure out the rules, and I quite liked it.  I've given it a preliminary rating of 7.5 for now, and will adjust after more plays.  Fun game with a great theme.  Now I want to watch [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/]Big Trouble in Little China[/url]!  :)

Rating a 6.5 for now.  I enjoyed it during a solo game.  But it fell a little flat when we played with 3.  I have a feeling it's best with 4, so you don't need the fiddly rules for the open spot(s).  Components are very nice and game is challenging.  Rules could be organized a bit better.

Ok, but I'm not feeling the love yet.  I might feel different if somebody taught me the game instead of trying to learn from the rulebook.  Also, I don't understand why I don't hear people complaining left and right about the icons, like they do about Race for the Galaxy.  I never had any problems with RftG's icons, even in my first game, but I'm frequently confused by GS's icons.  Maybe the difference is having a player aid per person in RftG, but having to share a single player aid among everybody in GS.

RATING: 9
Brutal, clever, free flowing and engaging, this "impending doom" coop still stands taller above all other similar games. For me, it blows Pandemic out of the water, due to its stronger puzzle nature. Pandemic, with its brilliant "shuffle back and put on the deck" mechanism, is a highway stroll on a good visibility day gone wrong, whereas Ghost Stories is a cross-country ride in twilight gone terrible from the get go. What stands out in this one is the way the 9-tile grid placement defines the likely strategy, and the general setup variability that the game offers, coupled with the last stand boss battle. This is a masterfully crafted game, and one that I will be certainly playing for years to come.

+ Strong escalation arc that constantly increases the tension towards the final battle
+ Brilliant forward looking and planning cycle
+ The release valves of the yin-yang and Qi provide both an assurance but also a source of desperation
+ Simple, elegant ruleset that can be taught in 10 minutes
+ Short in duration, packing a true cooperative beefy game
+ The theme is bang on, and comes through very well
+ Works equally well solo (with 4 Taoists) to 4 players

= Alpha gamer syndrome is present and needs to be avoided
= Very hard and unforgiving to start with, the way a true coop should be

- Although the art is evoking enough, a darker and more theme-appropriate type of art would make the game even more enjoyable

This game is really, really hard. If you can get past the difficulty, it is really a fun game. The pieces are excellent and the game oozes theme. The tension builds throughout and a victory leaves you with a definite sense of accomplishment. Can be played with less than four, but I wouldn't recommend it. My wife and I play four monks and each control two. Any less monks just ups the already insane difficulty.

I really enjoy co-operative games. Here, a great theme and components deliver a compelling, tense and fun cooperative experience. It doesn't feel like I'm just trying to solve an abstract puzzle. We're battling ghosts here, man!  The theme gives the game a feel of being a Kung Fu Horror Movie.

Another nice touch is the fact that there are numerous difficulty levels, allowing players to constantly challenge themselves.

I'm just not convinced I like the way the game handles less than 4p, with the power tokens and neutral player. I'd prefer to always play with a full compliment of 4p if possible.

Amazing, great game. It is beautiful, challenging and fun. The game itself is language independent which is a plus. What I didn't like the scale of the suggested difficulty levels so we modified the difficulty according to our group. (There is a big jump between the 2nd and the 3rd level). I didn't like the rulebook either. We made way more mistakes in the 1st play-through than we usually do.

I haven't played it, but I use it all the time when asking about other board games. "On a scale from 1 to Ghost Stories, how difficult is it?"

I finally got around to playing it. Holy Christ, this was the most difficult co-op I've played. We knew we didn't stand a chance when the board was getting haunted all around and we didn't even get to the ONE boss. I shudder at the thought of higher difficulty levels. 

Something feels a bit off thematically in this game. How does a Taoist's being pestered by a ghost affects which locations in the village will be haunted? It doesn't matter much, though. I liked this a lot and I hope it will hit the table again soon.

Solid, relentless co-op. Fun, but my rating is definitely elevated by the very nice artwork and components. I might prefer it as a solo game if only because there are other games I'd rather reach for in a group. That said, when playing with less than 4 players I now only play it by the 4-player rules with each player controlling multiple characters (I've never played this one 3-player) because I'm convinced that the official rules for less players makes the game unbalanced.

BGG trade for Nuklear Winter '68.  I'm sorry to see this one go.  RnR doesn't care for coops, and I don't care for solo gaming, so this wasn't likely to hit the table.  I may pick up the iOS version.

Rating increased from 6 to 7.

My first two games (solo and 2 player) were very easily won.  My third game (4 player) was more difficult.  I wondered whether this was a function of more players and therefore more ghost draws (in a 2 player, the 2 neutral boards do not draw ghosts).  

Today, we tried two 2 player games at Initiation level.  We lost both, badly.  Things heated up quickly and did not relent.

I don't know why my first two games were so easy.  I made no rule mistakes I'm aware of.  Suddenly the game is much better now that it is more challenging!

Dec. 7, 2008 -- I'd like to play this a few more times before really making a decision about it, but after my first two plays, I'm lukewarm on it. I like the theme. I like the production values. I like some of the mechanics. I even like the cooperative aspect, although I wish there were more ways to cooperate with the other players.

As the ghosts haunt areas of the board, the game becomes tense and hard decisions have to be made. The end-game for a losing situation comes on quickly and everyone has to rush to try to turn the tide. The end-game for a win is anticlimactic, though. The bosses are little more than tough ghosts with a special power or two, and when they're vanquished, it seemed to me it was an "oh, did we just win?" moment.  I expected something a bit more big and intense with the boss battles.

Tentative rating of 6/10.

Just played twice (2p) yesterday and liked it!
Nice mechanisms, which work even with only 2 players.
I see some problems with the effects of randomness (sometimes you just don't HAVE a chance), plus maybe it might get boring if it hits the table too often (repetition).
Anyway, a great game I enjoyed and will love to play again.

Got a signed copy which includes a drawing inside the box by the artist. The artwork is absolutely amazing.  

The rules are not always very clear on some points. It does need to be played in order to apply all the rules perfectly. Moreover you need to get a hang of what all the villagers and taoist can do, and when to make use of it.

It is a very nice coop game, that also plays well with two players. You can also play it solo, but then all the decisions are up to you, and you don't have a second opinion on things. 

I do think the game has great replayability and variety, because of the different gamelevels, different incarnations you have to beat in order to win the game, different taoist powers and the setup of the villagetiles. 

Played it with 2 players mostly and a couple of times with 3. We won 1 time, and lost all the others. It is hard, but exciting and I can see improvement, but we still need to find a perfect strategie to beat the game.

Getting a bit frustrated with the game, Because my sis and I cant seem to win. We won't give up though.

Ghost Stories is a story of the downfall of good intentions and great expectations. My interest in this title when it was announced before Spiel 2008 was immediate: strong subject matter, colourful and evocative artwork, and cooperation. Repos may as well have offered crack-on-a-stick for all I cared. I bought the game after a quick session in which about 10 ghosts were dispatched and then took the game with me on holiday to play a few solo games. Welll... they didn't go as I had hoped. I was quickly overrun from all sides and after two frustrating evenings put the game away. Then I started playing with other people and watched my initial enthusiasm burn away, to replaced with disbelief, which then gave away to plain exasperation, eventually ending up in indifference. We could not win a single game in the +/- 15 I played, we rarely succeeded in getting Wu-feng on the boards, even. The feeling of fighting a losing battle soon became too overpowering for me to enjoy the game much, and as a result the game has been gathering dust ever since.

I have thought long and hard about this, especially since there are people who are obviously full of enthusiasm for this game. Once the initial confusion about the rules subsided, it turned out that many wins against the game were achieved in 'solo mode' where some rules have been introduced to make up for the fact that no live players participate. The game is easier to play under these circumstances as the power tokens allow for powerful combos to appear which do not exist in the genuine multiplayer game; also, the ghost deck is smaller. A few experienced soloplayers have offered to try to beat the game at the lowest level in 'multiplayer mode' with some tweaks to make the game as hard as possible; and to their credit (and, admittedly, my amazement) they succeeded, but not without a big amount of trouble, and certainly not as smoothly as in solo mode. I've been forced to revise my opinion that the game is therefore 'doable' on all low levels, although I don't really see people winning multiplayer games on the most difficult levels Nightmare and Hell in all but exceptional cases.

The question then becomes one of it being [i]fun[/i] to play. Opinions on that of course differ. I think that for a coop to succeed, players should have a certainty that their planned actions succeed with at least a very high probability. Ghost Stories fails on that account: just look at the tao dice. You can [i]take[/i] an exorcism-action, but in a lot of cases you don't know whether it will succeed or not. Such a pronounced element of chance ruins the game for me. (Once I realised this, I could also explain why a coop like Witches of Salem provokes the same level of distate.) I don't like the idea of playing a game and then realising the outcome was not only due to me playing a sound strategy or applying sound tactics, but also because the dice and cards cooperated or may have cooperated. (After all, in solo mode impressive win rates have been mentioned, so [i]there[/i] it cannot be all chance.) I find it very hard to disentangle good play from chancy play in this game, especially while in multiplayer mode, and as a result I haven't touched it in quite a while. I prefer Pandemic and even the ageing Lord of the Rings coops, simply because there [i]everything[/i] a player does has precise consequences. It is understandable why a designer would want to introduce an element of randomness into these certainties, but the price—loss of control—is not one I am willing to pay for a coop.

There is another issue at work with Ghost Stories, but it took me a long while to realise it. Ghost Stories is not really a game about [i]winning[/i], it's a game about [i]not losing[/i]. The monks—the players—are continously losing life force, tao, yin-yang, and sometimes even their special abilities. The question is whether they can sustain those losses until some arbitrary cut-off point, which in this game means the final incarnation of Wu-feng. Now contrast to a coop which does things right (say, Pandemic): the players themselves never lose anything. Instead there are just anonymous timers of a kind to force the players to hurry up. This is too a kind of not losing, but on a much more subdued and abstracted level.

[b]Update[/b] The game never got played anymore, and I so let it go to a home where it would be looked after better.

If you like challenging co-op games this is for you, the mechanics and theme are top notch. If your group doesn't like stiff challenges then steer away.

 Indeed, 2 player games are super hard to win, but if you do eventually manage to win then it feels like you had just conquered the world. Three and four player games are a bit easier but still, this game comes at you and never-ever lets up trying to beat you down, making victory all that much sweeter.

My only complaint about this game is the rule book, it is a little clunky and badly laid out but once you learn the system the game is a true gem.

It's a beautiful game that's well-designed, but it's quite oppressive.  I like puzzle-ish games, especially co-op ones, but I also like games where I feel as though I have a shot at winning.  This is not one of those games!  I felt hopeless playing it, as though none of my decisions or moves mattered because the board just kept getting worse and worse.  I didn't find the game to be fun.  

I'm sure part of that is the learning curve, and that we played sub-optimally.  I tend to enjoy other co-op games, though, even if we get our butts kicked in them.  This one just rubbed me the wrong way; I'll play it again, but it's not something I think I'd ever request.

Have only played this once, and am looking to try it again. Love the theme so much, but it seems like it's very easy to lose thanks more to a bad draw than bad strategy; even moreso than in other hard co-op games. We got absolutely pantsed in like 3 turns.

Difficult co-op game where you always feel you are going to lose.  The dice can be very frustrating, and you can plan your turns perfectly and still lose with only a few bad rolls.

RATING: 8
Great co-op game. Easy to learn, fast paced play, beautiful artwork.
My one gripe is that at times, the fighting/destroying ghosts can become slightly repetitive, but it's a minor nitpicky thing to say for a great game.
The reason I didn't give it higher is likely just a personal preference to DOAM co-op games.

I am always open to taking in new cooperative games. Ghost Stories is very challenging and quite a bit of fun. It's like Forbidden Island meets Arkham Horror. I like how the different characters all have their own powers and how the villain has different incarnations that keep the game fresh through multiple play throughs.

RATING: 8
The joy of this game is its difficulty, as the ghosts just keep coming the odds are always stacked against you. Working together is paramount and each player feels they have something to offer to help turn the tide. A brilliant game which encourages cooperative play like no other.

Very challenging cooperative game of reasonable length.

Absolutamente horrible. Cómo puede un juego cooperativo estar TAN basado en el azar? Puedes ir toda la partida bien, y que al final se te tuerza la suerte y empiezes a fallar las tiradas, sin que nada pueda impedirlo. Puedes echar a perder una hora entera de partida solo por cuatro tiradas que se escapan de lo probable.
No entiendo como a la gente le pueda gustar este festival de dados. Que si, que a los cooperativos hace falta azar o si no se convierten en un puzzle, pero esto es pasarse. Puedes perfectamente estar anulado toda tu partida, solo por malas tiradas. A la hoguera.

Extremally hard and challenging cooperative game, that doesn't forgive you any mistakes during the game. The first 5-6 times we've played it, we lost completely.
The art of this game and the components are really outstanding.
And what I really like is that you feel, how the ghosts are overcoming you, how all your plans are ruined when wrong ghost appears, how you strugle for surviving.

Components: Great artwork, and nice iconography, though there are so many icons that they are not all easily understandable. Sturdy tiles and player board.

Experience: For two players, too daunting and laborious. There were several tough decisions to be made, but without knowing what the deck had in store for us, it was only chance whether our actions would turn out to have been optimal. We had lots of rules questions.

First impressions after one play: This is very hard. We played on the easy/introductory mode, and we still lost big time. I liked the challenge, but the challenge might have been too much for some of friends who found the onslaught to be hopeless. The rules are a mess! Poorly translated, I suspect. I had to resort to watching Rahdo's runthrough at the table to figure out how to play.

I'm a sucker for kung-fu movies, and I think the game has strong theme from the player special abilities to the villagers names and help provided; the art is the awesome icing on the cake!  Can play solo, and multiple expansions if needed.  Game has multiple levels to customize difficulty, and each game is different depending on how the villagers are arranged and cards come out - whew!  What else is there but a 10….  In case more justification for a 10 is needed, my number of plays on this in the last 1.5 years more than doubled my next highest number of plays on a game!

Fun, but I don't think it's going to see lots of plays. Something about having to go through just about the whole deck and just eliminate stuff before facing the boss makes the game feel a bit drawn-out and not quite as much fun, for me. I did enjoy winning my first victory with my 9-year-old son, who really enjoyed puzzling things out (he's more of a puzzle fan than I am -- I like them, he loves them), so there's the allure of the game for family settings. But the lack of STORY (ironically, given the game's name) dings this one. I suppose I want more Arkham or Last Night on Earth qualitative gaming elements -- this one is purely quantitative and planning. The dice add a measure of family fun, that will of course frustrate some gamers (not me).

Maybe it's just my taste for cooperative games, but I totally dig this one, just as I dig Pandemic. They have different themes and also different vibes.

Although dice can be frustrating, the game has this Something that makes me play at least 3 games in a row each time I take it out. I've only played two-player so far, but I imagine the game only gets better with more.

RATING: 5
It's a tough cooperative game that relies on rolling dice and this is where i feel the game fails as not getting the roll is extremely punishing and there's not much you can do to help with improving your dice rolls. I think this is also a fail with the ghosts as all ghost have the same colours needed to roll and some multicoloured ghosts would add some variety to this. I'm not too sure why this is rated so well?

Dice-chucking co-op mayhem for when you're feeling high and mighty and you need your soul to be crushed to understand the concept of humility. Can be mitigated, but I haven't played this enough to understand the extent of how much it can be mitigated. Need to play this more.

This game has a fairly dominant strategy. Once you learn the strategy it's pretty rote. Up to that point the game was fun and challenging. But the cooperative aspect forces some players into really boring roles.

Ghost Stories is one of my favourite cooperative games. It has a lot of replayability, a relatively simple rule set and a great theme supported by excellent art.

After one play, appears to belong in the pantheon of the top notch co-op games, like LOR and Pandemic. In many ways creates more personal tension, as the game often adversely affect each players abilities, through curses etc. It really feels like the game is out to get YOU.

From Wu-Feng's heart I exorcise at thee. For Tao's sake I spit my last Qi at thee.

This game is a nightmare. The horrors will stream constantly, at your own behest even as the game encourages you to bring extra monsters forth, and that stream will eventually cause you to want to panic. And in that panic, you will forget to trust in planning over luck. At that moment, then, you will have rolled yourself onto a path of death rather than salvation. While you will curse your failure, it will be out of fun-stration, that is frustration due to fun, copyrighted phrase pending, you curse the game and begin thinking about your next gambit to defeat it.

Intense, hard to win coop with a great theme and some nice art, especially for the monsters. I find the rules a little wonky, and the game more difficult to learn and teach than it should be. It can be a bit repetitive, but it's nice to roll it out every so often when we need to be humbled.

A cooperative game with an oriental theme involving ninjas, "Qi" (life), "Yin/Yang" and so on. The players act as ninjas trying to keep monsters away from haunting the board center tiles (village).

The art is cool but the monsters just keep pouring over and over and stronger and stronger, giving very few chances of sucess. What is worst, they usually only give one turn brake after their appearence before haunting the village, meaning the players have almost no time to plan anything ahead...and then they must be beaten through some ordinary dice roll - Yeah, you can add one token or two to the roll, but...well, i skip this one!

I don't own this game, but I have played it a decent amount of times. I am not a huge cooperative game fan, but I enjoy this one quite a bit. I like the theme - fighting off ghosts and evil entities from hell is pretty cool. I like the fact that there is a good blend of strategy and luck, and that each game will be very different with player abilities, tile placement, and Wu Feng incantations. Overall really good and enjoy the opportunity to play!

(2014 Essen: compro 5 cartes promocionals: Crazy Shaman, B-Rice Lee, JCVRice, Chuck No-Rice i Steven Qi-Gal, per 3€).
1-4 Jugadors. Cooperatiu.
Funciona molt, molt bé en solitari.
Duració: 40 minuts. Ni de conya!! --> 90 min (potser amb més experiència anem més ràpid): Hi ha 55 cartes de fantasma... trigant 2 minuts a resoldre cada carta (bé, a fer tot un torn), te'n vas als 80 min.
Similar a l'Yggdrasil, però el setup és algo més llarg (per partides més ràpides millor l'Yggdrasil)
Hi ha 'cert' atzar en els exorcismes (tirar X daus, i treure Y resultats).
Es pot ressuscitar taoistes morts i es sol fer.

I love co-ops, but I also like to feel like we have a chance at winning. That's not to say that I don't like difficult co-ops.

Despite losing repeatedly, there is something about this game that keeps bringing me back because I retain the ill-founded hope that I can pull off a win. 

After a few more plays, I could see how the game could become annoying because losing is often guaranteed.  The dice often seem to play too much of a role in the game's outcome.  Of course, you can mitigate the negative effects of the rolls, but it comes at a premium.  

The theme is neat, but it is not all that immersive.  I could easily see this one leaving my collection soon.  If I want to play a cooperative game, I would rather bust out Pandemic.

I have only played this game solo, but it is one of my favorite games to play solo.  There are many little things that you must remember to do each turn that can easily go overlooked, and when I realize that I have overlooked one or two of them it can distract me and take away from the experience.  I am 15 plays in and still accidentally overlook little things on occasion, so it is not an easy game to master.  Furthermore, it is VERY difficult to win but once you figure out how to win it becomes possible to win with regular frequency.

I ignored Ghost Stories for a long time. Something about this game just didn't click with me. It was the release of the iOS version that pushed me over the edge and made me try the game. After a handful of solo games on the IPad, I was sold. The game is brutally hard and I haven't won any of my games yet. But each play is such a nice puzzle. It's so much fun to figure out the best way to deal with all the bad stuff which the game throws at you. Ghost Stories is a real nice solo game and the usage of the iOS spares you the burden of the setup.

One thing I haven't made up my mind about is whether I like Ghost Stories if it's played as a real coop game and not in solo mode. In my non-solo games a lot of the puzzle like experience I value so much was replaced with long discussions about which move to make. Not that there is something wrong about debating with your friends, but somehow I value the strict puzzle solving nature of the solo game more than the social aspect of the coop experience. 

So as it stands now, my rating of 8 is for the solo mode. Played with more players this rating drops to a 7 for me. Maybe this will change after a couple more games.

Ghost stories does a great job of making you feel like you're getting attacked by ghosts on all fronts.  The game gets increasingly stressful as you try to fight off the barrage ghosts.  They just kept on coming, and coming, and coming...  I started to lose hope at one point, but it turns out we were victorious in the end!

So I liked the game.  It's definitely worth playing.  Make sure you have someone experienced to play with (if possible) because the symbols are a little confusing at first.  There are a lot of little things to remember.

PS Pandemic is better...

Not really sure what to think about this game? Co-op games are hard enough to rate as it is but this is even harder as I don't care that much for the theme. The game itself is quite clever and you really have to plan your moves to win it.

Need to play it again.

Update: Sold it, not a big fan of co-op games.

One of the most beautifully illustrated board games anywhere and a coop game with no equal.  People who don't like coops won't be converted but there is much to love here.

The theme in this game is wonderful and creative.  It's such a staple of Hong Kong cinema that getting a game about kung fu monks battling the undead of Chinese folklore is a stroke of genius.

This is basically a game of judging odds and making educated guess about the best path through the perils.  In a sense, this is all you do and it could seem repetitive.  I like dice odds and so this works well for me and there are enough special factors to keep it interesting throughout.

This is also a highly difficult game.  So much so that anyone who finds it to be easy almost certainly has made rules mistakes.  There is a perverse compulsion to keep playing until victory.

Players are fighting back ghosts from taking over a village.  Beautiful looking cooperative game, where players take turns to introduce a ghost, and then take a turn doing something in the village.  Players can move, then either try to banish a ghost, or use the ability on that village space.  Ghosts gradually encroach on the village and eventually begin haunting village tiles, negating the village space ability.  Players win if you can survive until the "boss" ghost appears, and dispatch it.  Nicely produced game with a fantastic Eastern/anime look, solid rules and game play, and just the right sense of growing dread as you are snowed under with ghosts.  Felt very similar in style to Shadows over Camelot and Pandemic, where you advance evil and then do something about it.  Much better game play than Shadows, but because everything is open the cooperative table bully can run the game for everyone.  I'm finding it best as a solo game, or a two player with my wife.  Space Alert is the latest king of cooperative games; Ghost Stories, while beautiful, blends in with the rest.

A highly thematic, cooperative puzzle... and damn difficult - just exactly the way I like it.  Things get even more unpredictable, complex, and thematic when you start throwing in the expansions, but I don't have a problem with any of those things.  A little imagination can go a long way with this one.  The expansion also greatly enhance the storytelling aspect of the game as well.

This game is excellent solitaire and it has a neat mode that utilizes only one monk; but you can play it just fine solo using all four monks as well.  Either way, it gets bonus points for thinking of the solo player. :thumbsup:

And the artwork is real cool too!  :cool:

I have played several solo games where I controlled 1/2/3/4 monks.  This game is growing on me.  I find the rules easy to explain.  At first, the game seems heavy where symbols are concerned, but once you have the symbology, it flows rather quickly.
Recently, I played a 3-player game.  We lost, and had a discussion.  We find that even though you are able to use the 'Neutral' monk's power (if you have power tokens), lacking the neutral monk's action phase (Yang phase), while observing the Yin phase (ie. the Ghost phase) slants the game in Wu-Feng's favour.  A such, we feel it is a 1, 2, or 4 player game - ie. All monks need to be active if you plan to have a hope in Wu-Feng to win.
This game is on it's way to becoming my favourite co-op game.

Update: Finally played a 4 player game vs. [thing=54883][/thing] & won (on the easy level) by the skin of our teeth.

4 players is where this gem shines.

Best co-op in the business. That's right i said best, you better believe it, yes better than pandemic.....yes way better than spirit island. Why? the puzzle my friend that's why!

you see some of you guys will see this game as an extremely difficult non stop influx of ghosts that just can't be dealt with never mind the boss if you even get to see him that is!!!

but seriously that's not what this game is about. You see the puzzle is a puzzle of survival and tactics to make the most out of the 9 villages there to help you. Most people i have played with after failing the first run of the game miserably want to try again employing new better thought out tactics. They can visibly see how much closer thay get to the boss!

The best games are ones that leave you dissecting every move making you think what you could have done better. When that win comes the feeling of self satisfaction is like conquering a great challenge and there arn't that many games in the business that can do that.

Despite my usual issues with cooperative games (due the gulf in me that exists between alpha gaming and complete disengagement with a game), Ghost Stories does a lot to get me interested.

Interesting theme backed-up by gorgeous artwork. Brutal difficulty, followed up by a crushing boss-fight. An interesting collection of abilities placed out randomly to create a board. All this together helps keep me at least a little tuned in, and thus earns this cooperative struggle some points with me.

7 Plays:

The game is great. It seems impossible at first and takes a few plays to get a strategy. The white moon expansion makes it less luck based but is not essential as it does make the game longer due to much more meaty decisions that have to be made. Plays best at 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Rating may edge up or down upon repeated plays.  I don't quite have a handle on the strategy for this one yet.  I love the cooperative mode, as I have a 5 year old who wants to play, but does not like it when someone (especially his brother) conflicts with him.  It feels like there's a good mix of luck & strategy, and the dice rolling makes it never feel like just one person's playing every piece.  Even if we provide "strong guidance" for my sons, they still get to roll dice & such.

hard co-op puzzle. I feel a bit like a grey hound that caught the rabbit with this game. As soon as i had won once i lost all compulsion to play.

Very nice components though, and i really loved the theme. Part of me wishes i hadn't traded it off.

I'm not a big fan of the co-ops. Normally I prefer to compete with other players then with the game. This one can also suffer from one of the players taking the leading role bossing around and telling other gamers what to do in each move.

Co-operative game. When we played for the first time we were 2 and took 2 characters each. Played with the easy rules and we won. One of the characters died twice.

Artwork is very beautiful, them is interesting.

I would want to play it again with advance rules and more than one major ghost in the pile. Interesting first game. Harder game should be more challenging, therefore maybe more interesting overall.

Low downtime, different tiles at different places should be good for re-playability.

First game was basically learning the rules and getting a feel of the game.

The total package for me, and definitively my favorite co-op. Tense gameplay throughout, with so much riding on every move.

UPDATE: Turns out its both. It’s really hard and the rulebook is terrible. Traded.

UPDATE: Of all the co-op games I still own, this is my least favorite. (Not that it's bad, just one of them has to be the least favorite.) I don't know if it's because the rulebook is terrible or if it's just really really hard.

UPDATE: A few more plays under our belts and I'm really liking this one -- I like that there are always interesting choices that you can make throughout the game. A very good game with a very bad rulebook.

Boy, a lot of new co-op games out now. Got this one for my birthday and after a couple of plays I really like it.

Big thumbs down to the rulebook, which is very unclear in parts.

This is the game that got me interested in co-ops again!  Arkham Horror is also a horror-ish co-op, but Ghost Stories scratches a similar itch, plays so much quicker, and doesn't have nearly as many fiddly bits.  The art is so well done in this game that I feel it alone was worth the price of admission.  It's great that this game can be played solo and the special abilities of the villagers/taoists make the game fun.  I really like that the rulebook provides many ways to tweak the difficulty and provides the ability to score your performance.  It's great that there's no semi-hidden information either, which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to other co-ops.  The only negative thing I can say about it, is that the rulebook doesn't clarify so many of the situations that can occur in the game.  At least there's BGG with a FAQ.

I recently got this as a birthday present from my other half. So far we are having fun, but maybe that is because it's still in the honeymoon phase. I think the only way to enjoy this game is to start out knowing that you will never win. It is brutally difficult, and you can discuss about strategy all you want but this is a luck based game. It has both dice AND cards. In my opinion, the power tokens are rubbish for 2 players. Every turn you have either a ghost to battle or new ghost coming out. You have no time to keep running back to the centre tile to pick up tokens when you are being overrun. The only way to play properly with 2 is to control 2 monks each and use the powers of the monks 'real time'. The rule book is abominable. I don't understand why foreign language publishers are too cheap to invest in a native English speaker to proofread their rules and cards for spelling and grammatical errors. Geez! I'd do it for free just to avoid the aggravation!

Ghost Stories rocketed to the top of my favorite games list when my friend, Galen, introduced me to it back in 2009.  Thanks, Galen!  The art is as beautiful as the game is difficult, which is very.  No, seriously.  I've heard people describe Ghost Stories as masochistic.  Winning always requires lots of tough choices and cooperation.  Unlike some other games in my collection, I never mind losing at Ghost Stories.  What can I say?  I like hard games :)

Really enjoy this game.  Thank you Thought Hammer for sending the Guard House expansion for free with it too.  Have won most of the game I've played so far, but barely.  And all on the easy level..so time to step up to the hard level and find the pain most have.

RATING: 7.85
Ruben's a 7.5 and Mel's an 8, so we ended up at a 7.85. 

Ruben: Best with 4 players. (Mel agrees.) Likes the mounting threat as the game progresses, requiring quicker  thinking and an increasing challenge as the game continues. In other words, it's well-paced.

Mel: Cool theme, one of the few co-ops that really encourages COOPERATION instead of a leader barking orders at soldier monkeys a la Space Alert. I like to use it as a gateway game because the theme is "cute" enough to get non or new gamers to consider playing, but requires a lot of strategic thinking (which doesn't really occur to said players until after it's over).

Tight co-op game with plenty of theme.  Ghosts coming at you from all sides makes it even more fun.  As with all good co-ops of this sort, you get the feeling that you have a good chance of winning, that you are really in control, until all of a sudden a chain of events sends you reeling.  My daughter is so good at this game that I wonder why I play at all.  She just tells me what to do...

This game has always been quite popular with the BGG crowd, but frankly, I don't get it. Is it the oriental theme that I have little affinity for or is it the game play? As to the game play, it's a surprisingly simple game once you learn how to play and understand the iconography. I mean, very simple. Run around and collect chits and try to roll colors you want. That's pretty much it. There's not much of an arc to the game. What I was doing on turn 25 was the exact same thing I was doing on turn 1.  Every turn is the same.  I think it'd do well to have a day and night phase or two halves of the game or something to indicate a passage of time and have things change instead of just doing the same thing over and over. 

Furthermore, it's the least cooperative game of the three old school coops. You don't really cooperate so much as just play all on the same side. Not a bad game, but nothing special IMO either. 

For my money, I much prefer Knizia's LOTR coop over the other two old school coops, Pandemic and Ghost Stories, and after having played LOTR not till after both of those, I'm not sure I get why people went gaga for those two when the LOTR design offers more interesting choices and variation. The hand of cards you have offers more individual decisions than either of those. From my experience, I would've guessed the order was Ghost Stories > Pandemic > LOTR.

It seems very difficult for sure. It is kind of fun to try to do the apparently impossible as a team. I'm not sure how good the ratio of strategy/tactics to luck is yet, though.

RATING: N/A
I love, love, love:
- the artwork
- the colorful board
- playing co-op
- the replayability
- asymmetric player powers

I dislike:
- always forgetting what the Tao tokens and Yin-Yang tokens do
- the rulebook's poor organization and occasional typos
- player elimination
- ever getting to choose where to place a ghost

Final verdict: Enjoyable game that's difficult to win, fun to play, and a good way to spend time, but being able to choose where to place a ghost is weird, as it takes away from the theme but does allow you to strategize.

Ghost stories is a pretty simple cooperative game to play, but a difficult game to beat. It also has a really great theme. Interestingly, the White Moon expansion makes it more complex and meaty, and yet we find we almost always play it in its base, simple form. I would like to see more tile options for it, but otherwise I think it is near-perfect the way it is.

Game felt very tense, but also fun. Unfortunately it seems like the whole game is just rigged against you, which is a serious let down for me. I dislike when starting the game you're in a no win scenario, but the game played really well, was surprisingly simple once I got through the rule book, and at the end I enjoyed it. In other words I can get over the feeling of unbalance in the game because of the fun game play and the simplicity of the mechanics.

I think it's fair to compare it to Pandemic because the gameplay  has a Pandemic feel but with lots more chrome and things going on.  I have to say the card deck of ghosts is much more interesting than a stack of locations like in Pandemic.  I think the variety of ghosts and their illustrations is the best part of the game and give it a lot of personality.  The artwork is great (looks better in person than in photos on the Geek) and the icons look tough at first but are not so bad in reality.  I think it's a winner.  To me it feels like a bigger, longer more immersive Pandemic with a creepy theme.  One gripe:  the cheesy plastic monks look out of place next to the cool Buddha bits and otherwise great components.

Update:  I geeked out and painted my monks.  Now the game looks perfect.

I have played this game several times solo but never co-op. I enjoy the gameplay of this game a lot, but ultimately find the theme too dark for me to play again. I am a mechanics focused gamer so I overlooked it at first, but ultimately had to throw it away. It all revolves around a spiritual theme of exorcising demons as Taoist monks and with buddhas. Personally, I would not recommend this game to anyone based on the theme. However, I find it unfair to rate based on personal beliefs and convictions and so have rated it a 7.

RATING: 6
A very hard coop with interesting twists. The jury is still out on this one. It could easily drop to a 5 or raise to a 7. It essentially depends whether the difficulty comes from randomness or from the hard decision-making. I'm suspecting you have to get lucky to beat this one, in which case it would start to look like a boring "solitaire": draw the right card, roll the right dice and win! However, if it appears that you can beat it through good planning and strong play it could shine as one of the toughest and renewable coop game. 

Also note that this one exacerbates the "strongest-player-decides-everything" problem of many coop games since all the information is visible. The only game that I know of that really solves this problem is Space Alert. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Love this game. Cooperative, already gets a good rating in my book. I would love to play this again- this does depend on having good teammates who you can strategize with because even on "EASY" mode, it's "EASY" to get wrecked. My first and only game so far was a turn away from being a loss and dependent on clever use of the character mechanics followed by extremely lucky dice rolls to ensure a win. Extremely exciting, extremely tense, lots of min-max strategy, would recommend for strictly 4 people games.

Egyáltalán nem tudtam beleélni magam, pedig egy ilyen témájú kooperatív játéknál ez elengedhetetlen lenne. Végig totálisan reménytelennek tűnt a küzdelem, ami szintén nem dobott sokat az élményen.

Ghost Stories isn't all that different from most other cooperative games. There is a threat (evil spirits in this case) that increases as the game moves along. If the players get their priorities right and aren't too unlucky in their card draws and dice rolls they will likely beat the challenge.

The theme carries over pretty well in this one, but it is lacking a game arc apart from what the randomly drawn cards provide. Actions available to the players stay pretty much the same throughout. Admittedly, that is another trait that it shares with many other coops.

Anyhoo, over the last day, we have probably played this game 6 times...lost horribly every single time. Now granted, we are still trying to figure out strategy and symbolism...but DANG!!

I don't like cooperative games very much but I would rank this one above Pandemic, Flash Point and Forbidden Desert (Escape and Hanabi are significantly different).

A hard game that pushes the difficulty to a level that may not be any fun.  The rules are not very well written and playing with less than 4 by the rules that are written is confusing.  Not sure if there will be many more plays of this for me.  

Update: 10/2009 - I sold this a few months back and now I am buying another copy.  I'm going to give this another chance.

Update 2010 - A couple more plays and it is a keeper.  A fine, tense solo or coop game.  A bit abstract, but a nice challenge.

I love a good co-op game, but I do want to have at least the feeling that we might be able to beat the game. With Ghost Stories, that is not really the case.

Ghost Stories is quite a good co-op game. The artwork is fantastic and the gameplay quite simple. However, GS is f'n difficult- perhaps more than it should be. I like a game that isn't easy to beat but holy crap! It really feels like it is almost impossible to deal with all the god damn ghost curses coming at you! However, that's no real reason to knock it as I really do like all the stuff that's going on in this game. I don't even know why the designer would include multiple levels of difficulty. The noob level is a slaughterfest.

Awesome co-op with a great plot to boot. This game feels like a book that you don't quite understand, but something tells you it's a great and worth the effort to try to understand. I was confused at first with all the cards and possible actions, but I suspect after more plays it will grow on me (though I'm not sure if I will ever win - it looks insanely difficult to banish all these ghosts).

RATING: 8
Coined the term "Ghost Stories effect" for playing a cooperative game, where everything is well and after two rounds the game is lost, because everyone has died. Can be quite difficult.

Has some weaknesses:
- players can get "locked" using one location ability and tend to be left out on the actual gameplay save for the ghost actions...
- once again, a luck based game, where the dice can turn on you.

Interesting co-op. Discouraging as hell at first, but the theme and unusual mechanics keep bringing me back for more punishment.  The art is beautiful. In fact, aside from Dixit, this probably has the most beautiful artwork I've seen in a board game.

The component quality is [i]mostly[/i] good, though not up to the par set by the actual art.

Dear Secret Santa! Thanks a lot you for this great game! So now we will show the Wu-Feng, where his place!
Much to my regret, the game was incomplete. Absent all the figures - monks, ghosts, Buddhas. I, of course, I can cut them out of cardboard, and play. Just a pity that there is no complete figures. But you, Santa, of course, irrelevant. This is a picker in a factory hands grow from assholes.

In few words - very very nice game, great graphic, nicely designed, amaaaaazing climate amd last buut not least - it's cooperative.

Gave it a go with the solitaire rules.
It feels like a constant uphill battle.  If I'm reading the rules correctly (and there's no guarantee of that, although the rules aren't nearly as bad as people make them out to be), the game is ridiculously hard!

On Initiation difficulty, came within a couple of moves of destroying the boss.  A rotten draw of a ghost that inhibits tao token use by the yellow player (who had two tokens of the boss' colour) did us in.  Even though pure bad luck let us down, it was still a very exciting game.  It has a Shadows over Camelot feel, without a traitor.

Very exciting to plan moves together.  Love the dice.  Randomness haters beware!

RATING: 8.5
Wow. Like what's been stated before, it's a feverish & crazy survival to the end- if you can make it. It can be difficult (or seemingly impossible at times), but that only makes you want to come back for more! Components do a decent job of getting players into the theme & the tempo of the game is great. The only niggle is getting familiar with the iconography- but it only takes 1 game.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent solitaire, where I just play all 4 of the characters myself, there are solitaire rules but I prefer playing all 4 characters myself, as its not any harder to do.  

Come to think of it, I think this is one of the best newly published solitaires I have played since D-Day on Omaha.  Which really surprised me, the theme is excellent, the mechanics well balanced and even a little innovative.  I wouldn't call it highly narrative, but it does involve a whopping amount of decision making paths, (with the expansion there are even more options).  All of it packed in an easy to teach package that plays quick, my games have mostly been around the 1hr mark.  

A tactical triumph!

Edit: Play this some more multiplayer and I'm bumping this up to a 8.5 . Excellent fun challenge.

First game was an absolute failure.  We weren't afraid of no ghosts but we sure got spanked by them.  The artwork in the game is great, the theme is wonderful, but the rulebook is lacking big time.  I really need to read over the FAQs on BGG as there were so many questions that it really sort of ruined the first experience and this is an experience game.

Conceptually it sounds great and I may like it a lot more with further playings but seriously, is there really an excuse for a bad rules translation from a big publisher?

Do you enjoy working together with your friends to get horribly beaten by a deck of cards and earn a negative score for your troubles? Then this is the game for you.

This is the first board game that burned my brain and I respect it greatly for introducing me to that phenomena. It's still tough to beat after multiple plays, so much so that I don't pull it out much unless I want punishment. The rules are messy, too, but I'd still rank this as one of the best co-ops out there. The dark artwork and constant creep of the surrounding haunter figurines make this game incredibly claustrophobic and thematic. I had nightmares after the first night I played it!

This game is awesome, but exhausting.  You feel constantly like you're constantly behind and that there's never just one good option. It's smartly designed that way :)

It's frustrating, because it's so hard to win, but that's what makes it so playable.  At the same time, it's also a little traumatic, being so intense, so sometimes your group is shell-shocked and doesn't want to play it again for a while.

Played it because I´m a sucker for coop-games. I think it´s the worst coop in 2008. The way the rules are organized didn´t help either.

I personally hate games where strategy is to gather additional dice to throw and then still failing the throw (ie Anachronism).

[b]INITIAL COMPLAINTS[/b] - Strictly a solitaire game.  With other cooperative games, there is at least a modicum of concealment with players having hands of cards that cannot be displayed.  Even if you're allowed to tell your teammates what cards you have, there is still the need to communicate and the need to involve everyone in the planning.  In Ghost Stories, a player can just stare at the board and the chips in front of each player and come up with the "right" move.  Someone else might have a better idea, or they might not, but in any case they're doing exactly the same analysis you're doing.

[b]UPDATE[/b] - My opinion of Ghost Stories has improved markedly after resigning myself to the fact that it's a solitaire game. Playing solitaire (with four Taoists) is an enjoyable puzzle on Nightmare or Hell levels. For solitaire play, I would rate Ghost Stories a 9 (with the Guardhouse expansion). As a multi-player cooperative game, I would rate it a 6 - I would much rather play Lord of the Rings or Space Alert or Hanabi or Pandemic.

This is probably the hardest co-op game I have played and one of the better too (only beaten by Space Alert). There is a constant panic to extinguish the threats that appear and seldom any breathing room. What I like with this game is that it has a pretty short playing time, but when Pandemic feels pretty arbitrary after a few plays, I can see that this requires a lot more strategy and tactics to work. The game is pretty and even though the different abilities on the cards took a little time to understand, I didn’t have problem halfway through the game.

Good cooperative game.  You're trying to kill ghosts in this game.  One complain I have with this co-op game is that the most experienced player can tell everybody else what they should do and it feels almost like that player could have been playing alone and the final result would have be the same.  Very hard to win (even on easy) but it's very pleasant when you do win!

My choice for a coop, based mostly on its theme, but I'm also very happy with the game play and high level of difficulty. My expectation was that it would be played predominantly solo, but I've found I far prefer the social exercise of group problem solving with four players, as well as the shared excitement when we win. I have the White Moon expansion, which I'm keen to try because it looks to add so much more narrative to an already highly thematic game, but I've held off until we manage to beat the base game on some of the higher difficulty levels.

As far as game mechanics go, this one was interesting and compelling as a co-op.

I do not really like the theme, but especially do not like the bizarre cultural syncretism between taoism, buddhism, the undead, and horror. The artwork, though facially intended to be slightly humorous, is macabre and uninvitingly dark.

If the game had a different theme, I would certainly own it and play it again. But the theme is a big turn off. I won't rate the game because I would honestly have to put it below a 5 for theme and artwork alone. For game mechanics, though, it's well above a 7, possibly above an 8.

The BGG ratings have no accounting for subjective taste in anything other than the game as a whole, and my thoughts about it are too disjointed for me to be fair about it.

Got in several plays at BGG.CON and it was favorite of the show.  It builds to almost overwhelming the team by game end with scalable difficulty to keep it that way.  This leaves plenty of tension and some agonizing choices as the ghosts build in power and Wu Feng's final incarnation appears.  Really good for teamwork play.  Good playtesting and design make this a challenge every time I've played.  Never had a cake walk through.  Update: After 50+ plays I'm still enjoying this, and exploring solo play.  It's also fun, but think this game's best and most difficult with 4.

Consider AUCTION
not an easy game for some of my friends to like...once they got the sense that we were losing they got demoralized and almost wanted to quit...for me this was what made it a great experience. We are still early on in figuring out how to win making this an excellent puzzle that also tests your groups' ability to stick together in the face of adversity. Maybe i need to find braver friends.

update...played a 3 player round today and it was incredibly interactive, tense, fun and frustrating! 3 instances of two of us rejecting a proposal that seemed off the mark that turned out to be borderline prophetic by the least experienced player. Great game

RATING: 5.5
Extremely challenging. However, unless there's some grandiose strategy that my gaming group is missing, there is no meat to the challenge. Much of the game's outcome relies on random chance, with the odds skewed against you. I don't feel an abundance of player agency in this game.

By far the hardest co-op I've played.  The ghosts just seem to keep coming and coming making it an epic struggle.  While this sounds like it might be a bad thing, I find that it makes you want to keep coming back as it always feels you're only 2-3 plays away from winning.  The artwork is really good (may not be for younger ones.)

I think this game is the hardest of all games I have ever played. Do not confuse "hard to win" and "hard to learn/play" though. It is simple to learn, but will take you a long time to master, it's very tough. This game is difficult even at the easiest level of difficulty!

It is somewhat fun (a masochism kinda fun). But after you have beaten the game a couple of times, the game just lies there on the shelf taking dust... :/ Unlike other maso coop games like Arkham Horror and Eldritch Horror

I played two consecutive games of this on 20/11/08 and we got beaten both times, on the easy skill level. It's different enough from other co-ops, and has a high level of tension, which makes the game interesting... It has very high replayability, with all the different randomisation options in the setup (village layout; player colours and their 2 different special abilities; 1 of 10 incarnations of Wu Feng used per game)
Can't wait to try this again.

Not a bad cooperative game, and I liked it at first, but it's repetitive and can become a little boring. On most turns, you draw and place a ghost, resolve their powers, then move your character (or not) and either activate a tile or roll dice to exorcise a ghost. Choices are very limited, with most tile powers being circunstancial and rarely (if ever) used. The theme is the main appeal of the game, but it's just not there, even with the nice miniatures. As for the artwork, I like the use of color, but I'm not a fan of the cartoony style. Also, the difficulty to win can vary a lot depending on various random factors and even the number of players. It's probably best played solo with all characters.

kici kung-fu szerzetes szétrúgni szellem se..ed
Ismét egy távol-keleti téma a tervezőtől, ráadásul elég brutális erősségben. Ez a kihívás faktor valakinek vagy kerülendő, vagy épp ez teszi vonzóvá.
Első találkozásra simán a túlvilágról visszatérő szellemek nyertek, alig éreztem azt, hogy kici kínai szerzeteseink irányítanának bármit is, csak sodrottunk a támadók áradatával.
Pár játék és a szabályok rendes áttanulmányozása után azért már növekszik az esély, hatásos fegyverré válik a kung-fu. Mivel minden körben új kíséretek jelennek meg, a falu védelme sosem könnyű, folyamatosan mérlegelni kell, mit is tegyenek a négyek a lehető legjobban kiaknázva a képességeikben rejlő potenciált. Néha ez elég, néha nem.
Ráadásul a játék utolsó köreiben (ha a szerencsések eljutnak odáig egyáltalán), megjelenik az ördögi vufeng és ő grabancát kell elkapni a győzelemhez.
Szép a játék kivitele is, igaz kicsit csalódás a kockák minősége (kopnak, de rendesen). A szabályokat, a négyek és a falulapkák különleges képességeit azért érdemes rendesen megismerni, bár könnyen tanulhatóak. Mindenképpen kell pár (vagy több) játék, hogy megismerd a benne rejlő lehetőségeket. Aki ezt rááldozza, sok élménnyel lehet gazdagabb.
Nekem egyik kedvencem, szívesen ajánlom azoknak, aki keresik a kihívásokat és el tudják fogadni, hogy itt dolgozik bizony a szerencse is és bármilyen jól alakultak is addig a dolgaink, akár egyetlen új szellem elég és rögtön a földi pokolban érezzük magunkat.

Great game, a must have for everyone, as it makes a perfect game for Halloween.

I love: The design. It is superb to look at, great art and it has miniature.

I don't mind: The randomness of the card draw. Drawing a bad set of ghosts (especially those who force you to draw again) can bring the game to a swift conclusion, but after several plays, you should know this will happen.

I hate: Re-playability of the basic game. I wish there were more village tiles available, so that there were less obvious series of actions in certain situations: such as "go here first, and take this action, next player does this and take this action, which means that we are a in perfect position to take down this big ghost". Feels very systematic. Finally, GS suffers from a very bad case of leader player, where 1 player dictates every one's action.

This game holds a special place in my heart because of the cooperative play combined with the theme, phenomenal artwork, and overall challenge it provides.  Thank you, Peter Frantz, for introducing me to this game!  It's no coincidence that it's also made by the same maker of my favorite game, 7 Wonders!  You'll find you and your friends nervously anticipating each and every dice roll as the stakes stack further and further against your favor.  I remember in my first game I ever played, where we came down to either losing or winning based on one last dice roll.  We ended up winning and all loudly celebrating as a result.  This also happened once more later on as well.

Awesome coop that is never too easy (which is my main complaint with coops)!  Great with any # of players (including solo play). Only complaint is that depending on playgroup, game can be dominated by one person because there is no hidden information.  This is mitigated by just how many things you can do so it never feels like one move is correct.

Beautiful game with a great theme and some nice mechanics - I really ought to enjoy it. But it's challenging bordering on the ridiculous, and the game never feels like it's building towards a climax.

It might be best solo. This is probably the best solo game I've ever played, though; the difficulty is harsh at first, but soon enough you relish the (awesome) fact that the designers gave you multiple difficulties. The learning curve shows you there's a cool game under the hood. 
I'd still like to try it more with others, though.

Meh... like all other co-op games I know, it's like playing alone, since you just agree on the best way and the active player will do it.

On top of it, it's mostly luck driven. I find Pandemic much more interesting, even though it got the same problem I mentioned above.

Oh and just for the record, as ppl say it's a very hard game, I played it twice and won both...

Its like Arkham Horror had a baby with an abstract euro.  I liked this, but I'm probably not going to buy it.  Its a shorter, more dry, more abstract version of arkham horror.  The game can get very repetitive and if you don't plan well you will lose.  You basically do the same thing over and over for two hours.  The decisions aren't particularly tough, its more of "well, i guess I need to do this" 

Its still a lot of fun.  The theme is great, the pace makes it go by fast, and the components are good.  This one could become a classic as they add expansions to increase the depth and give the decisions some meat.

Nice co-operative game with pretty straightforware gameplay with some added complexity from locations and less than optimal rule-book.

Absolutely our favourite co-op game. Less fiddly than Pandemic, straddles the Ameritrash line enough so that the theme sticks out a mile, there are so many valid and interesting choices to make almost every turn, and it really is all for one, and one for all. Also, it presents enough of a challenge so that every win is e'er the sweeter.

As cooperatives go, this one is tough but fun. It looks great on the table, and has the players discussing their moves usually without much analysis paralysis. It was tough for me to see the real impact of my decisions, and in this respect, it suffers from the randomness problems that most co-ops do. Even so, it packs a lot of fun into a short playing time, and I wouldn't really be sad to play this, even though I may not find it as fulfilling as some other games.

A very neat game with awesome art and superb solo playability. The rules for solo play are very reasonable and balanced, and while it is also possible to play with four monks (like with four players), playing with one monk plus the rules is just as haunting an experience.

The game is pretty random. Even with a good strategy, and after a few lucky rolls, it's still possible to draw a combination of ghosts that totally screws you. And the die rolls when ghosts haunt tiles, while always dangerous, can end the game quickly if you're unlucky.

All this however makes the game all the more challenging, in a good way, and personally I never felt like I was only at the mercy of the dice. There's always plays available that can minimize the dependance on luck, and you better find those, because you can count on eventually getting unlucky otherwise.

I think this game starting to sour a little bit.  Can be very punishing if you don't roll well, and really really work together.  And in general, so many bad things happen throughout the game, and only a few times to things seem to go well.  Not a good balance in terms of stressfulness.

The number of meaningful decisions is very low and the game feels entirely decided by luck.  Despite the excellent artwork, there is absolutely no immersion in the theme.
Do not try to understand the rules without trying a few turns; the rules are quite difficult to understand, despite the game beingquite simple.
This is my opinion after one single game, maybe I was expecting too much, but for now I do not plan to try again any time soon.

Well I tried a few times, just to try to find some merit in the game.  Winning or loosing, this feels repetitive and boring.  Score down to 3

After a couple plays I just don't get this game.  I bought this off recommendations as a premier and challenging co-op, but it feels full of analysis paralysis.  Everywhere you look on the board is some confusing symbol that you have to take a minute to look up.  In that time you are likely missing three other things that you could be doing.

With the poor game play experience I do want to give this game kudos for beautiful artwork that fits the theme perfectly.  The components are all quality and the out-of-the-box storage is spot on.

First play, lost & loved it.. it is very hard, something i like. I have to play some more though, my concern (as with any Co-op games) is, that once you have figured out the best strategy, it won't make any sense to deviate from it.. at wich point the game plays itself basically. But then there is the Black Secrets expansion wich could remedy that by making it 1 vs. many.. let's see.

Down from 8 to 4.. figured out the best strategy.. now it's boring. Common Problem with most co-ops.

Down from 4 to 3.. the mechanics are not so easily figured out, so people who are not good in deducting the best strategy make everyone else loose.. on the other hand if the clever ones tell them always what to do.. they would become superfluous.. man how i hate playing straight co-ops..

!Spoilers!

Best Strategy (imho) is:
Blue: double actions, gets 2 buddhas every 2'nd round, every other turn fights two times on corner & places both buddhas.
Yellow: token generation, gets more tokens and stays with green preferably on a corner.
Green: reroll, stays with yellow preferably at corner and kills 2 ghosts a turn with the help of yellows tokens.
Red: 1 other player move, helps out, places the weakening colored token & kills with Qi the tough ones.

This co-op is very challenging, based on (1) solo play w/four monks at the Initiate level.

I didn't even make it to Wu Feng, but I enjoyed it, and was definitely challenged.

The rules are as scattered as say, Arkham Horror; not impossible to comprehend, but not gathered in any one place, even using the many downloadable summaries and FAQ's.

But I like it!

7 Wonders is often seen as Antoine Bauza's crown jewel, but for me it has to be Ghost Stories. Ghost Stories is just about everything I want in a game. It's challenging with lots of options. It has a great theme. The complexity to payoff ratio is off the charts. It rewards multiple plays and subtle strategy.

It's unfortunately seen as too random by some, and I can understand that. Ghost Stories was on my trade list for a bit after my first few plays, but sticking with it really paid off. Ghost Stories is a game about risk and action optimization. The deck is symmetrical giving you insight into what can and cannot happen later in the game. The dice are a risk but smart play can allow you to flip a situation from a risk of whiffing an action to a random chance of saving resources for later. The game is unforgiving to mistakes particularly with how you position your samurai and gives you many subtle cues as to how you should be playing each turn.

My absolute favorite part of the game is the pacing. Games all tend to start slowly allowing you to start setting up your initial strategy. The deck can play out a few different ways from a constant threat to an explosive start followed by a lull, and recognizing how the game is playing out is a key to playing well. So the game has great tactical choices as well as some solid chewiness at a strategic one.

Lastly, the game just plays great solo. The lack of hand management makes it easy to manage multiple samurai, and they are always working together so it feels more like activating a team one-by-one than playing as separate characters. One of my favorite solo games and just one of my favorite games in general 

Best with 1-2 and good with 1-4

- godawful rulebook

Rough trade in the form of cardboard and plastic.  A crazy, ever-shifting puzzle that actually prevents immersion in the rich theme.  If you let the mechanical aspects of the game fuzz into the background in order to provide a foundation for the experience of being a Taoist monk desperately fighting the legions of Hell, you will lose.

The game begs you to do so, with gorgeous art and super production values, but ultimately you have to look past the theme and see the grinding gears of the puzzle box if you have any hope of ever winning.  Also, there's an enormous luck component (repeat die rolls to exorcise the ghosts), meaning that even optimal play can be fatally hosed with gallons of demon-tentacle spew.  And the rulebook is... nigh impenetrable.  I'm still not completely sure how some parts of the game work.

For all that, it's an 8?  Yeah—it's stuck with me, I've been thinking about it, and I want to play it again until I beat it to death.

UPDATE:  Dropped to a 7.  Suffers from the same problem most co-op games do, but to a degree I just can't get over:  one person masterminding everyone else's turn.  Perhaps it's better suited to solo play instead of "one guy solves the puzzle while directing three chit-pushers".

[b]Note:[/b]  [i]Later expansion cards don't match this edition.[/i]  They use thinner, slightly larger cards which mangulate when shuffled and are obvious in the deck.  This would be solved by sleeves, if I believed in sleeves, but I don't as they are hateful abominations—an affront to the delicate tactile sensibilities of the human hand.

"But Chris," you say, "in [i]Ghost Stories[/i] you don't hold the cards in your hand!"  But I [i]do[/i] hold them in my hand—as I slap someone smaller and weaker than me, right in front of you, someone who didn't deserve it and would never have gotten slapped in the first place if you hadn't opened your stupid mouth.

(Gave this to the kids.)

[b]Repos English edition 2015[/b]

- thinner, slightly larger cards than earlier editions; matches 2015 printings of expansions

- improved iconography

- vastly improved rulebook

[i]Seven years later.[/i]  Resurrecting this (heh) now that the kids are of age, and whaddya know, the game's pretty good with truly respectful co-op players.  The [i]X-Men[/i]-like teamwork from those who value the sanctity of the individual turn (i.e., we all have something to offer, but your turn is yours, and yours alone) makes the game shine, and allowed us to win for the first time in 6 plays.  And I can see how we might need to actually increase the difficulty... and my rating.

Also:  my mechanic/thematic grumblings above?  Utterly nullified with good players.  With the right people the game feels like it looks, spooky-beautiful.

I really had a fun time playing this three times in a row and winning the third game. The game is very difficult and I suspect you need a good group; a bossy person or a vigilante could ruin everything. 

The game is very tense and created a real sense of camaraderie. I suspect I would like this game less the more I play it. It feels good to go out on a high note.

Nekem nagyon nem jött be, a 10 éves lányomnak igen. Persze sokat rontott rajta, hogy rossz szabálymagyarázattal kezdtünk el játszani, ezért folyton félbe kellett szakítani a játékot. Ráadásul tipikus kooperatív játék hiba jött elő, vagyis egy játékos lépett szinte mindenki helyett. 

Jó szabályokkal játszva, már sokkal szórakoztatóbb. Persze sokszor ki is kapunk a játéktól.

Lost badly the first three times playing with other people.  On the fourth time I played solo & it was super easy (all plays on initiation level).  Maybe I'll just play solo from now on & increase the difficulty level.

Update: Played solo with normal difficulty & won.

My wife then played solo on initiation & won.

I think a pattern is emerging.

Played twice more with 2 players & only just won on normal difficulty.

With more than 1 player his game is hard ... probably too hard for my liking.

Played again solo on normal difficulty: so much easier than the 2 player game.  I can't imagine a 4 player game with 15 extra ghosts, no power tokens & still only 12 spaces to put the ghosts.  Plus, before player A can act again 4 new ghosts would have come out.  Just impossible!

I guess I am just of a fan of Bauza's designs, cause Ghost Stories is another game I really like. A very hard to win coop game that has you playing as Taoists protecting a village from ghosts. 

The game is one of the simpler games to teach, and like 7 Wonders is language independent with many symbols that pretty much explain what all cards, village tiles and dice do. Yes, the die rolling can be "swingy" but there many ways to help with mitigating dice, such as Tao tokens that help defeat ghosts, different village tiles lowering their resistance, and even the powers of the Taoist themselves. 

A really solid game, which even without expansions, is great. Needs to hit the table more.

El Ghost me gusta, pero no le pillo el hilo aun para una táctica ganadora, muy entretenido y muy difícil, mantiene la tension

07/nov/11 sube de 8 a 9, aunque pierda se me hace muy entretenido, es rápido de montar, rápido de jugar, táctico y un azar muy medido, muy entrete!! Bien por Bauza!!

11/nov/2011 es rápido de montar, es entretenido, tiene mucha tensión, jugado hoy por primera vez en modo pesadilla y es espectacular, hoy por hoy para mi, el mejor juego, sube a nota 10, obligadamente tendré que hacerme de las expansiones!!

This game is HARD. Easily the hardest coop I own. However, I get the feeling that it isn't hard in a way that I can control. I feel like no matter what strategy I use, winning and losing (mostly losing) depends on which ghosts come out when. Sometimes, its a puzzle you can solve and win, and a lot of the time, you get overwhelmed and are screwed.

Maybe I just haven't gotten the strategy yet, but from what I can tell most people that get GOOD at the game still barely win half the time. That feels less like a puzzle I can solve and more like... well like stuff is just happening to you. Which isn't why I play coops.

Very well produced co-op game that is much tougher than Pandemic and has that same "things snowballing out of control" feeling. In five games I'm yet to even reach the big boss - and that's on the easy level. Deceptively simple but it takes a while to come to grips with the options you have. Definitely makes me want to try again!

RATING: 6
Second game much harder.  I think it has something to do with playing with the correct rules.

A cooperative game in which the players all have different powers they use to defeat the automatically generated threats.  The obvious comparison is to Pandemic, only the results depend on tokens and dice rolls instead of cards.  It's really a game about prioritizing and using available resources. Timing is very important because some ghosts affect how others can be fought.  

Though I liked the claustrophobic feeling of this, with the ghosts closing in around you, I think I prefer Pandemic for this sort of thing because it's a cleaner, less convoluted design.  But then again, this isn't my favorite sort of thing, either. (2 play)

Un éxito entre los niños de mi entorno. En neto es un juego de gestión de recursos cooperativo con azar relativamente controlable, en el que se puede considerar que los dados "sirven para ahorrar marcadores". Añade también algo de poderes variables (sólo 8) y de "combos chupi" y no tiene nada de "follow the leader" de otros cooperativos. PROS: más profundo de lo que suelen ser los cooperativos. Temático ("transmite") que deja ganas de más.CONS: excesivamente dificil de ganar (frustrante). Azaroso cuándo "tienes mal día con los dados". A veces los dados ganan la partida

Superb components and challenging gameplay. I really like the art and the story that gets told through the games. Beating off ghost never felt more satisfying. The cooperative part really makes for a pleasant experience. The only let down was that once Wu-Feng is on the table, he was not that much of a threat. Of course this was only the Initiation level.

Ghost Stories is a mature co-op with great dynamics and play and wonderful art and illustrations.

I love this in solo and up to four player versions and believe it is a tie with pandemic for the best cooperative game I have ever played. It is in my top ten of all-time and I could not recommend it more highly to everybody.

I only dock the game 0.5 because it is almost cruelly hard, and some gamers I play with don't like it because they feel like it's impossible to win.

Wow, what a fun game. Too bad it's so unbelievably difficult. We haven't come close to winning yet, even on the easiest difficultly level. I'm sure once we do win, it will be a glorious moment. Even when losing, though, the feeling of urgency from being completely overwhelmed by ghosts is just great. It ends up being a super addicting game. We've almost never been able resist playing several times in a row.

I can imagine this moving up a point.  While it is a cooperative game, the chaos of it all makes it much less of a group think exercise.

This will definitely be a crowd pleaser for folks who enjoy the genre.

Well the first thing you notice is the art, it really grabs your attention and invokes the theme very well. The game scales from 1 to 4 players and from what I can see it would do it well (fairly open system). You can also scale the difficulty easily as well which is another important factor. Gametime will come in around 60 minutes, or potentially less if you get hosed like we did... 

Tension builds quickly here and does not let off once it ramps up. Ghosts start invading and it is pretty challenging trying to keep them under control, we played the easy level and started off good but quicky got smoked around the midgame with no point of return. 

Decision-wise a little more to consider than Pandemic but I'm still not sure how much more really, some of the optimal moves seem obvious but notice I said SOME, I think there were several times where we really had a hard time decided our next best move as once again there are several ways to 'skin the cat' and you just never know which peril might be next. This is where it does surpass Pandemic for me, decisions on where to place ghosts, what actions to take, and every situation looks a little different, you can't just go building 2 or 3 stations spread over the board to help your chances like in Pandemic. 

Replay worried me a little but I think mostly it will be good, I was surprised to see that the 9 tiles for actions that make up the board were the only ones included, I smell an expansion. I do think because of the challenge there will be lots of game in this package, its just that with another even 2 tiles it could have been that much more. Also I think (not sure on this one) that only the 4 roles for the players were included, another role or two could have really added here. Turns do feel somewhat 'samey', this is where something like LOTR bodes well. Don't forget here though, because the main engine is card driven (ghosts invading) the randomness of the ghosts invading should keep each game a little different, also even where you 'place' the ghosts could potentially change the outcome of a game due to what action is directly in front of it. 

Summary - Co-op fans rejoice! Lots to choose from, all we need now is more shelf space to house all these new great games and smaller boxes when possible... (publishers have mercy please!)

Bokkensprong St Amandsberg 3/4/15. Coöperatief spel waarin je geesten moet verslaan, en uiteindelijk ook Wu Feng. In je beurt moet je eerst een nieuwe geestenkaart trekken (tenzij je er al 3 hebt liggen, dan verlies je een leven)(Yin); dan kan je je ev. 1 stap verplaatsen en ofwel tegen een geest vechten (door vb. te dobbelen) ofwel de actie uit te voeren van het dorp waar je je bevindt. Vrij moeilijk spel; wel gewonnen.

RATING: 5
This was a tough, frustrating game. I think a big part of the frustration comes from the dice. It seemed like if a few more rolls went our way we would have been in decent shape, but for a game that's as hard as this to come down to a roll of the dice is just a bit frustrating. And I'm not saying 'oh if only I'd rolled 3 blacks on 3 dice and then the next guy rolled 3 yellows on his 3 dice we'd have won' I'm saying that we failed to kill 1 hp guys with 4 dice a few times. Those are over 80% likely to succeed. And because of the nature of the game we almost never take a shot on less likely fights, so the luck can't really go the other way to even out. When a less random game is hard and you lose, it's ok because you can blame yourself and work harder next time, but when you lose in this game it's all the more frustrating since you know someone else who played exactly the same way could have won.

RATING: 8
Very challenging co-op game.  You are four kung-fu martial artists defending the town against a horde of ghosts and ghoulies.  Each player has a special power.  Each ghost has a special power.  Each tile of the town has a special power.  Each turn you have to choose which action to use or which ghost to beat up on (by throwing dice).  Never enough people, always on the edge of defeat.  You're trying to last long enough for the boss man to come out so you can defeat him.  Very challenging!  Susceptible to dominant player syndrome though.  If one player is much more experienced or assertive, can start just telling everyone what to do as no one has any secret knowledge (like no cards).  Otherwise, good fun!

Yes, this is hard.  Yes, there's plenty of luck with the dice rolls and the way the ghost deck is ordered.  But so far I've enjoyed it, even though I'm losing.  I guess I'm drawn in to the theme?  And I like the challenge, next time I'll pass on some exorcisms to instead take advantage of villager powers.

This is a fun game. The game play is fairly simple when you figure out the rule book. Ghost Stories is a very hard co-op game.

Quite fun and interesting. The mechanics work well and combine a simple enough ruleset with plenty of decisions.

Still, I can't help feeling that it brings little new to the coop-genre. Also, the theme feels quite superficial - a shame considering the gorgeous artwork and in general the game's potential to be a great "experience game".

RATING: 8
A truly hard cooperative game, even at the easier levels.  Players work together to defeat the great bad guy, Wu Feng.  The taoists move around the board to exorcise the ghosts and recruit the help of the villagers before Wu Feng comes.  

This game is great.  We love it.  We find that we do not play it as much, but I cannot put my finger on exactly why.  We love it everytime we play, but it doesn't hit the table that often after the initial burst of lots of plays.

Game is very hard but very fun as well. You start off feeling like you're drowning in ghosts and soon enough you're swept away in a sea of them.

You have to like that foreboding feeling in games where it starts off bad and only gets worse from there in terms of the outlook for chances of success. The main thing to keep in mind that makes it a bit easier is that if you're relying on dice rolls to kill enemies most of the time then you're probably doing something wrong.

After more plays, I like Ghost Stories less and less. I only enjoy the game if I play it with the right game (funny) group. Nowadays I found the decisions somewhat obvious so luck (cards and dice) is the main determining factor in victory or failure.

Ghost Stories feels very repetitive and the gameplay is long for what the game offers.

I think this can be a better 1 player game as turns would be so quickly and downtime will be zero. I will try it this way soon on the iPad to see if I’m missing something. 

The art is great though. There are lots of better CoOp games out there (Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Sentinels of the Multiverse).

My very first impression with this game was a bit disappointing one. I took a glimpse at the box cover art, and I cannot help but look the other way. I understand that many like this kind of art-style, but for myself, it was simply weird. It took me many months before I decided to pick up my copy after receiving many recommendations from others to try this one out.

The components were amazing out of the box. Ghost and Taoist miniatures, and thick tiles alone were enough to impress me. And the arts found on cards were actually pretty well done! It seemed like there were two different artist worked on this game - one for box art and other just for cards. 

Each taoists' special ability combined with villagers to drive off waves of ghosts were very awesome. Especially if you have watched any of old Chinese ghost stories films from 80~90s, you can really immerse yourself into the theme. 

I tried this game at introductory level by myself, and barely beat it out of 5 tries. Until I can get the mechanics down, and come up with a strategy, this is going to stay on my table for a long time.

An uber tough brutal Co-op game that I am really enjoying.  With wave upon wave of enemies constantly putting pressure on the players.  The rule book is a little awkward with the game being alot simpler than it makes out.  There is also alot of iconography which, being in a flamboyant Chinese scroll doesn't at first glance make the game easy to comprehend.  Despite a few flaws the game plays very well with luck and strategy both playing a part but not to much.  I love the way the game is scored which adds to the feeling of helplessness.

The game I originally hated. This games plays incredible with the coop game version or the equally fun playing solo version. Every turn ghost keep popping up around the board. You have two choices, use the village tile you on or attack a neighboring ghost. Sounds simple. It is not. A few bad rolls and it is over. Each player gets a Tao monk figure and chooses which side of the player board he will use for his special ability. Make it to the master ghost, WU-Feng and defeat him and you will scream in ectasy.
I have White Moon the sequel. Right now it is way too tough for me to play.

-----original review----
I hated this game the first time I played it. Later I found out that with 3 wu-fengs it is impossible. Played it with one wu-feng solo and now I will play and teach to others. Cool game. I hate haunters.

I normally hate "optimization" games since they feel more like a puzzle; but this is so well cloaked in theme, and asks you to choose among so many options each turn that I am drawn in. (Some of that, I admit, is a preference for "sticky-rice to exorcise hopping vampires" in comparison to "potions to kill dragons, elves, and hobbits".) What makes GS for me is the constant level of tension, the large amount of luck (which mitigates the 'imitate-a-robot-and-compute' typical of efficiency game), and the random set-up which make each game feel different. Love the haunter mechanic (tiles flip over as they get haunted every couple turns). This game feels and looks unique--rare these days. Big plus is it can be played both solo or two player in [i]two[/i] different ways (with neutral boards, or each player playing several ghosts). I find myself not pulling it out cause of the set-up time--people complain about Arkham Horror but this is worse per game length.

Everyone is right, this game is very hard. Unfortunately, it's hard in the same way that rolling 3 sixes is hard, and not in the "how do we best work together to accomplish this goal" hard. It's pretty much solitaire, the co-op aspect is only true in the sense that you're all working toward the same goal, not in the sense that you're working together. You can mitigate your luck to a certain extent, but there are tasks that are so difficult you have to both mitigate your luck and roll perfectly. Maybe Pandemic is a luck fest, too, but at least it feels like you're doing something, and not like something is being done to you.

RATING: 8.5
Wonderful co-op experience that doesn't get to the table as often as I'd like. Very tough, I've only beaten it a handful of times. Cool mechanics, theme, and overall experience. Holding back wave after wave of ghosts is a challenge that doesn't let up, and the game is full of tough decisions.

We played a 4P game and got waxed, although we lasted long enough to see the big, bad ghost. The first turn after it appeared, three of us died, and the last player only lasted 2 more turns. 

I'm not opposed at all to difficult games, so I like the idea of a coop that's not a cakewalk every time. Still, I'd be interested to play again to see how much there is here. I only had one turn where I thought I could afford to use one of the 9 spaces, as opposed to moving and fighting. We did a decent job of handling haunted spaces (only got up to 3 once), but were slowly killed off by people losing life because all their ghost spaces were filled.

I'm really missing the thrill people are getting out of the current crop of cooperative games. Here your turn consists of moving and taking an action/fighting.

A relentless onslaught of ghosts that quickly turns into a downward spiral qi-less hell!!  It will be satisfying when we win this game. One day...

This is a good, difficult co-op. While co-ops are not my favorite, my fiance loves them and so I'm starting to enjoy them more as well. Funny that. 

Features of this co-op that my be attractive or un-attractive depending on your taste. 

- It is extremely difficult and will take a number of plays to find winning strategies. I do believe experience will pay off, though.

- It is very fighty with lots of dice-rolls. There are ways to reduce the impact of luck, but it is still there and a few bad rolls in a row can be difficult to recover from. I would guess a good strategy would include setting yourself up so that you are less dependent on great rolls to win.

- The tension the game creates is palpable. You feel like you are on the edge of disaster throughout and you will find yourself often in a position where there are numerous options and none of them good enough.

- The turns are quite repetitive. I think the short play time and constant tension mitigate this potential weakness, but it is there.

With 7 Wonders, Ghost Stories, Hanabi and Takenoko, Bauza is quietly proving to be a top-flight designer of mid-weight games. His games are all quite different from each other, but all good, which shows that his is a designer with plenty of ideas and staying power.

I think this is an AMAZING game!!! It is complex, challenging, thoughtful, intelligent, and exciting. The only thing keeping it from a perfect 10 is the horrendous rules book, which is almost worthless. I had to come here to BGG to get player aids and watched video reviews to help me figure it out. It can also be challenging to try and explain it to other players, so make sure you have patient and adventurous gaming friends.

Este juego es para mi una gran contradicción. No me atraen nada los juegos con esa temática, pero tengo que decir en su favor que me ha proporcionado grandes ratos de diversión.

En este juego sí que se puede decir que existe azar puro y duro, aunque los personajes tienen ciertas características que hacen que se pueda modificar mínimamente.

Las condiciones de victoria hacen que sea un juego muy difícil, en el que reina la frustación, pero por otro lado también te hace ser una piña con tus compañeros de juego, discutiendo a por quién va cada uno, cómo gastar los poderes...

Just awful.  The art is there, though campy (which isnt really my thing), the challenge is insane, and I just don't find it any fun at all.

I don't care for games that just beat you down every turn (same problem with Pandemic to, perhaps, a lesser degree).  I'm fine with a dash or even a helping of risk and crisis management (i.e. Downfall of Pompeii, Great Fire of London, etc..) but when the game's premise is extreme crisis management, where the goal is just to survive one more round with the hopes that the card draw will be favorable enough for you to mitigate enough each turn to survive, I just find that it lacks any sort of fun element and becomes more fatalistic than anything else.  

I know this is very low, but after having played this 3 times and having a similar disastrous experience with it each time, I'm committed to this rating.

Ghost Stories feels like one of those board games that was made for me specifically.  I spent a lot of time in the late 80s and early 90s watching supernatural kung fu movies such as Encounters of the Spooky Kind and Chinese Ghost Story.  So every time I play, I start giggling to myself as I play.  (And when I am all alone, I sing the Tao song at the top of my lungs while I play. [/shame])  But this is not a game I would recommend for everyone.  The rules are complicated and, let's just say it, the game is tough.  All that being said, it's easily one of my most favorite games EVAH!

n Ghost Stories, players are ninjas slaying all manner of evil spirits as they attempt to take over a palace. And they just keep coming...

...and coming, and coming. You know the famous scene in Rambo III when Stallone unloads with the M60, sweeping from side to side, felling dozens of Soviet soldiers in slow motion? Well, that's basically what this game is but with players rolling dice against a thick deck of baddies. There's some depth here, to be sure, but virtually every option and maneuver is spent either rolling dice or ensuring that a future roll will succeed. Roll dem bones. Autobots, roll out. Let's roll.

:zombie:

I don't really have the stamina for it. It reminds me of my old college roommate who would watch hours of Dragonball Z. You know how those guys go all Super Saiyan, pumping out gutteral war-cries while their hair blazes and the camera cuts back and forth?

Yeah, that's Ghost Stories.

After two games with two players:
We lost both games, which is good, at least the game isn't trivial. There is stuff to do and decisions to make but in both cases we fell slightly behind which eventually led to being massively behind and dying. There seems to be a good amount of replayability with variable player powers, a huge deck of ghosts and end bosses, a modular board and several levels of difficulty. Decision space should remain fresh for quite awhile, avoiding the feeling that you've solved the game. 

It plays really fast, which is nice, and makes many of the little shortcomings forgivable. It's a fun light hearted co-op game for people who don't mind rolling a few dice. Great game night opener or closer as it doesn't provide too much substance and plays quickly.

RATING: 8
No game puts me on the edge of my seat like Ghost Stories. Fighting the good fight has never been so tense, and I love the way that I have all of the townspeople by my side. The ghosts are challenging, and there's no sense of relief stronger than getting a ghost you know you can handle. The difficulty is what sets it apart. Yes, every cooperative game changes things up enough to feel like you aren't playing the exact same game, but Ghost Stories is on a different level. The way that you're working through the deck of ghosts in whatever ordered you shuffled along with a boss that is one of ten possibilities feels fresher than any other! I just wish that it came with a different deck of ghosts to use without having to buy an expansion that changes the core gameplay too much. 

That all being said,there needs to be a more clear explanation in the rulebook About haunters. Haunters only move on the active players board. My wife and I lasted for like 5-10 turns the first 3 times we played because we were moving all the haunters on every turn. There is a forum about it on BGG, but we have the 2013 edition and still made that mistake. The rulebook definitely left room for confusion in many more places.(I didn't realize what you actually did on your first turn until I watched youtube videos) Please fix it because it is otherwise such a great game!

A really good solo game. After learning some of the nuances of the game I can win about 40 to 50% of the time. The difficulty really ratchets with more players and I have yet to win with multiple players. Of course it may be due to the fact I have only played it twice with multiple players.

RATING: 7
A solid effort, definitely well designed, and the artwork (though not my style) is good.  Even the theme (though veering a little too close to fantasy for my tastes) is unique and more interesting than most.

Still, it's a cooperative game, and without some sort of traitor aspect I don't think a cooperative game could ever be a true favorite of mine.  Plus, Ghost Stories definitely would suffer from a "tell the other players what to do" problem when you have a more experienced, or just more bossy, players.

The game is really hard and I would imagine that it provides a good amount of satisfaction when you beat it.  I don't know how that feels yet, we still haven't won!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A slightly bland co-op game. Theme and components are great. Artwork is fantastic, but the game itself relies too heavily on icons. Fortunately, this isn't such a big problem as players tend to get used to the symbols.

The problem is that there is nothing outstanding about the game. Its a solid design and provides some fun, but there's no differences between one game and the next. In each game you'll face the same ghosts over and over again, and deal with the same situations over and over again.

Interesting cooperation game, which must be played with someone, who knows the rules, because it is very easy to miss something - for example to put a new ghost at the start of the turn. A breath of ghosts in your back is felt during the whole game, because it is not very easy to lessen the number of ghost cards on the board. The game is tough, but probably winnable.

Įdomus kooperatinis žaidimas, kuris turėtų būti žaidžiamas su kuo nors, kas gerai moka taisykles, nes iš tiesų labai nesunku ką nors užmiršti: pavyzdžiui, ėjimo pradžioje atversti naują vaiduoklį. Vaiduoklių kvėpavimas į nugarą jaučiamas žaidimo metu, nes sumažinti vaiduoklių kortelių skaičių ant lentos nėra taip jau paprasta. Žaidimas sunkus, bet laimėti, tikriausiai, yra įmanoma.

RATING: 9
Ratings upgraded to 9 after about 25 plays.  I am not a particular fan of co-op games, so I am surprised that I am addicted to this game.  I am attracted to determining the different permutations of the roles/tiles and how those affect your chances of winning.  We had problems winning the first couple of games, but thereafter, the game became much easier to win.  I am currently 1 for 2 in Hell mode (Solitaire).
  
------

It seems like the Solitaire version is the easiest to beat, though things tend to go to hell much faster.  The best role to select if you are having trouble winning are:
- middle tile: herbalist
- Green: no curse, extra die (play this taoist)
- Yellow: take tokens
- Blue: double action
Try to get lots of tokens before you go fighting (it'll only take one turn to load up to 9 tokens by doing a double herbalist and Yellow's ability).

Four player game is tougher because your tao tokens are distributed.  Your advantages are the extra Yin-Yang tokens.

Hard to win co-op that looks incredibly nice and has a great story. In the beginning you'll have some ghosts around the village and it can feel easy. Suddenly the ghosts are everywhere an it gets really hard to just keep on staying alive. The game has a very interesting clock built in it: on average you are having more than one ghost appearing every turn and in order to keep up you have to exorcise more than one on average every turn.

While it is action-packed and combat-oriented, it does have many Euro elements which tickle my fancy. I also love the roller coaster pace the game has, with enemies arriving in hordes, then slower than you defeat them, and then coming back with a vengeance. It makes for an emotional, exciting ride, that is worth playing even when you lose it (which I do).

Owned this only a very short time.  I don't enjoy solo gaming so that did not do much for me.  The difficulty in the solo game forces you to prioritize the corners so there isn't much strategy involved.  Group play wasn't any more appealing.  It didn't feel challenging, it felt like a constant struggle.  The artwork and colors are stunning but it wasn't enough to make up for a game that felt more like work than fun.

This game has a reputation of being extremely difficult, it is, but not in a way that feels unfair or forced.  The game doesn't suddenly change directions halfway through to screw with you, it just continues to build at a steady pace until suddenly you're at a breaking point.

I found this to be a very enjoyable co-op experience, the tension and difficulty level may bring out some Alpha-gamer bossiness so know your group, or in my case keep yourself in check.  Other than that I think this game is fantastic.  if you want to win every game play candyland.

2014-06-06 Great artwork, very good game. It showed me that cooperative games, where you defend something against a threat doesn't have to be similar to Pandemic (which is very good too).

2015-03-21 - I lower the rating (8->7), which still means it's a good game to me, but I don't know if I'll definitely keep it. I played solo, with two and three players, but never with four, which is the best number as BGG says.

A very difficult and exciting dice rolling co-op. The game drips with theme and the artwork displays it beautifully. The game is very appealing to the eyes, and fighting off ghosts is, not so surprisingly, tremendous fun. One that I would play regularly. My only caution is that the game is indeed difficult and that new players will lose, and often. I think that for many this will be too big of a turn off, however, the game is worth playing. Sometimes the most memorable games are those that render you completely inept.

キョンシー映画のラスト30分、クライマックスもクライマックスから始まるゲーム。
基本モグラ叩きなのだが、結果がダイスなので厳しい厳しい(笑)。

たいていの協力ゲームでは、敵コマをつぶす部分は、条件さえそろっていれば絶対に成功するように作られていると思うのだが(パンデミックしかりキャメロットしかり)、このゲームではそんな容赦は一切ない。
ダイスを握る手にも力が入ろうというものだ。

RATING: 7
Great game, very difficult.
The game provides a deep challenge, but replay value is limited to when a monster will come out, and a random 9 tile set up, with 2 possible special powers on each player.
That being said, I've played over 10 times and I've been too distracted by the difficult nature to be concerned with the samey feel.
The difficulty of the game is almost PURE luck! (with a bit of strategic movement)
If you roll the dice VERY well, the game will be ultra easy!  And if you roll fair, the game will be difficult.  If your rolling is bad, YOU LOSE!

An ass beating in a box, and it's wonderful.  Everything from component quality, to adjustable difficulty, to expansions.  This game has everything a co-op game should have. and is always edge of your seat challenging.  One of the few games that gets cheers around the table.

I have nothing bad to say about this game, unless you don't like a challenge, because it is very difficult.

An example of a well done co-op game.  I am somewhat iffy on co-op games, but this one handles some of the qb'ing by adding the randomness of a dice roll so you can't just puzzle every move out in advance.  The art and themeing of this game are extremely well done as well.  It is pretty hard to win though.

Very challenging, so it's a little disappointing when bad draws and/or bad die rolls can crush the cooperating players.  For instance, a small string of ghosts that draw other ghosts can turn a decent situation into a bad loss.  Maybe we could use some better strategies as well, but the game seems a little less varied than some other similarly weighted cooperative games.

Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell – Wu-Feng – and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.

I like challenging cooperative games, but sadly, [b]Ghost Stories[/b]' difficulty [b][i]completely[/i][/b] broke the game for me.

I would [i][b]really[/b][/i] like to love this game, but I just can't, because of the game's insane difficulty - and we are even talking about the lowest difficulty variant here. And that's coming from someone who also enjoys the really harsh [b][thing=121921][/thing][/b], which is also not perfect because it is very swingy, but at least you have options and can plan ahead.

[b]Ghost Stories[/b] would have been really great, if there would have been exciting peaks of challenge and calm moments for regrouping and strategising the next turns.

[b]Pandemic[/b] executes this balances perfectly. [b]Ghost Stories[/b] on the other hand just keeps coming and coming at the players, making them feel like they are juggling sharp knives and need to add another one after each turn -- until the inevitable catastrophe happens. Everyone knows it, it's just a matter of time. Challenge is fun, unfairness is not.

I'm especially frustrated with this game because I really love the fresh and unique theme, the gorgeous artwork, the easy rules and the modular board - but the game completely shuts me out of the fun. :thumbsdown:

The components are overall great, but there is one big negative aspect: the colour-coded dice are not engraved, so the faces will over time wear out and become blank.

This game could have been a 7-8/10, but sadly: it just isn't.

Back then it was an "I-like-the-box-design"-driven buy, now I'm proud to own everything that belongs to this game because it's one of the hardest and challenging coop game I own. Although its not hard to teach if you compare it to Robinson Crusoe or Battlestar Gallactica, it takes quite a few runthroughs to manage it.
I can understand that the dice-rolling can drew many people off but I think that's part of the fun to work against it and try to beat it. 
And after all: The artwork is fantastic.
Only negative point: The manual is a disaster.

Played once, 4p.  One of the weaker entries in the new crop of co-op games.  It really seemed completely random, like a series of events that just happen, and you're always playing catch up.  Other than the graphical presentation, which is excellent, I do not understand any of the enthusiasm for this game, when there are co-ops out there that require tactics AND strategy.

Have only played this solo. At first was very into it, then after 10-12 games, felt that it was formulaic.  Certain Monks could win any game, no matter which ghosts came out.  I'm waiting until I've played 2-4 player to make a judgement as to whether or not to keep it.

RATING: 7
I think this game has 1 big flaw, the dices. It's not that I hate dices in game, on the contrary, it's just that the odds are so low and each action is so important that a bad roll can cost you the game.

I suggested a variant that when you fail a roll, you get a token of the color of the ghost you wanted to banish. The goal is to reduce the effect of bad luck through the game. And possibly make a game played at easy much easier to finish with newbies.

By the way, most people say that the game is hard, but we managed to win a 4p game at easy. Still, we were working closely together and we were not so lucky. Personally, I think that newbies should have a chance to win an easy game.

From a mechanic point of view, this game could look like a puzzle. So people could find it more as a puzzle game with a very thin theme. Sure the feeling and the theme is not very deep when you play. The feeling you get during play is more close to puzzle solving.

Many people compare this game to pandemic, I could say that it is a bit true, but ghost story has something pandemic does not have: The climax. A game of pandemic ends in the middle of the "story", Here in ghost stories, the incarnations makes sure there is a climax at the end for more tension. 

The modular map is an interesting design that gives a bit of replay value. I like modular boards.

So in general, I think this game is very positive. Like I said, there might be a few changes needed to reduce the effect of bad luck. The games feels more like a puzzle where you do not get in very deep with the theme or in your character.

I played this game a lot trying to like it!  The first couple games it seemed really fun and sort of a great abstract puzzle.  After that it just became boring and annoying.  You do the same thing the whole game and then the ending is very random.  You either have what you need or you don't.  There's no way to plan for the ending, which is very anti-climatic.

If you don't mind Lovecraft themed games, this is a solid if frustrating cooperative game that plays fairly straight forward after learning just a little bit of iconography.  Still very much subject to the strong personality, the decision of what the person does is still very much up to the person.  Each player also has a special power that sets him/her apart.  The dice cannot be depended upon and you must manufacture your own luck.

Not a massive fan of co-ops but, man this one is something else. It's a puzzle, where every decision counts (in a way that if you make a wrong one, you'll eventually lose).

RATING: 9
Der Spieler am Zug hat eine Bewegung und eine Aktion (Feld auf dem man steht oder Austreibung eines Geistes an den man angrenzt). Davor melden sich allerdings die Geister auf seinem Tabloe, die bisher nicht ausgetrieben wurden, und die melden sich hart! Fluchwürfel werfen, Plättchen herumdrehen, ... dazu gesellt sich danach natürlich noch ein Geist, der eventuell noch mehr Geister mitbringt oder uns Austreibungswürfel klaut oder sonst eine schlimme Fähigkeit hat... Man befindet sich permanent am Abgrund und muss an allen Ecken Feuer löschen.
Mir gefällt das Spiel sehr sehr gut. Ich spiele es auch solo recht gerne. Das Spiel verliere ich zu ca. 90% geschätzt. Mittlerweile ist meine Quote deutlich höher, da ich ein paar Kniffe kenne was man auf keinen Fall tun sollte oder wie ich Geister auf jeden Fall weg bekomme. Neue Mitspieler sind glaub etwas überfordert von der Menge an Geistern die sie heimsuchen ;)

So, I don't love co-ops, but I love Ghost Stories!  This game just destroys you!  You have this sense that all is well and then, like 3 turns later, you are completely overwhelmed by haunters and your board is full and your spending your last Qi!  I know people who hate this game because it's just SO unforgiving!

RATING: 4
Rating after only one play, I felt like there was too much chance and too few chance mitigation options. The village actions didn't do much for us because we couldn't know which tiles were of use until it was too late, and the Dao/Qi tokens weren't powerful enough to help. Overall, felt like Elder Signs (which I'm nonplussed by) with less theme and information available to you.

I like it. Fantastic components with a great theme. Scales well from 1 player to the full four. I just can't help feeling a little disappointed. I'd been told its really hard but we always win when playing on normal - its just not that complicated to figure out what to do [hint: kill haunters at all costs]. We've moved up to hardcore, let me give it another 10 plays and see how I feel.

[update] 3 months later, turns out you need to really shuffle the cards, game is challenging to say the least. Unfortunately wife has completely lost interest so I don't get to play it anymore. Going to loan it to my little brother so he can get some joy from it.

I had heard and read a lot of people talking about how hard this game was. My wife and I enjoy co-ops so we thought we'd give this a try. 

I played it 3-4 times on my own to start and got completely destroyed making it about 1/5-1/4 through the deck of monsters. After re-reading the rules and finding that monsters only activate when it's the players turn of who's board they are on it made the game much easier. Still very difficult on the easiest setting but definitely doable with a proper strategy.

This game is probably the hardest co-op I've played, and you will definitely feel the tension as the ghosts start to overwhelm you. Generally I feel like this game is tempo-based: it is almost guaranteed that you will fall behind on killing ghosts, the trick is just to hold off loss of tempo for long enough that come end game you can just ignore everyone but Wu Feng for one last ditch attack before you die. Although several consecutive bad rolls early game can really screw you over, I feel like this game still requires a fair deal of strategy. Great art with good components, and although the dice come sticky as someone has mentioned in the forums using peanut butter will get rid of said stickiness.

EDIT: game is much easier with fewer players. Also, while luck does play a large factor this game requires a lot more strategic positioning of the monks & ghosts, along with risk analysis than initially meets the eye. Ideally, you never want to rely on the dice, and so risk mitigation is extremely important in this game, but sometimes there is just a ghost you have to finish off without a Tao token buffer, especially with the more limited resources with more players.

Co-op games aren't my favorite category.  But this game is so hard that it NEEDS to be a co-op. I played this once and was intrigued by it (despite the theme) because I played with some smart gamers and we lost quickly, a few times in a row. Being beaten by games is a feature I appreciate.  So I downloaded the iOS app to help me learn the mechanics and rules. In the end, I've found this game is just too hard to be fun. I don't need to win every game to like it, but a glimmer of possibility would be nice.

[All games played on normal difficulty] Great game. Gameplay is fun and tense. Artwork is superb. The game is difficult (only 1 win) but yet it is really fun to play. There is dice in the game but to win you need so much more than luck. The way you use the village tile is key (especially the House of the wind). Killing Wu-Feng is wicked satisfying. I cannot imagine how tough it must be with more than one wu feng.

Like Pandemic? Then I'm thinking this is another coop you need to play. It allows for more independent thought and action, and gives a wider variety of things that you can do/accomplish. It's also beautiful.

I think it scales even better in terms of difficulty, and that there is less luck that drives   your win/loss.

- too luck dependent; which cards come up and what you roll when you try and exorcise
- too difficult when it's based on so much randomness
- rules are simple yet some glaring omissions that I had to look up online

Surprisingly good.  It's one of the better co-ops and with enough richness and options that my strategy-type friends were thinking 2-3 turns ahead and advising everyone on their moves.  The art was good too.  The weakness was the rule-book which had us baffled for a good 40 minutes before we figured out that half the rules were buried in the explanation of the game-pieces rather than in the setup / first turn as one would expect

An excellent cooperative, tower defense game.  You are Taoist defending a village from evil ghosts.  You move your Taoist to fight ghosts by rolling dice or by activating powers on various locations in the village.  The final boss ghost comes out and if you defeat him, you win on the easiest level.  

The game is very challenging.  I suppose you can win at higher levels of difficulty but I am happy with winning on apprentice.

RATING: 5
A good Co-op game from the creators of 7 Wonders.
The only turn off is the strong theme... which would normally be a good thing.

However as a westerner I find the terms Chi, Taoist and many of the icons and illustration to be foreign and confusing.

This is just me however and I'm sure people who have greater interest in Japanese culture would find the theme enjoyably rich.
This is a good co-op game, not a multi-player solitaire (I'm looking at you Pandemic!), where each Taoist 
(the player characters) is vital to stop the onslaught of Kami and other evil spirits from destroying the village.

Punishing difficulty. A game over can happen really fast. It seems like luck play an important part, but I might just be a terrible player. Need more plays to get the hang on it.
The game is designed for 4 players. For less players, the rules are more complex and the rulebook badly explained them: it feels like an afterthought.

[Played more than 100 times]
Challenging (especially at higher difficulty) as any good cooperative game should be (so you wish to play it again).
Quite random (dice, order of cards and disposition of tiles do matter a lot), yet offering several tactical choices.
It has an "optimization puzzle" feel (that I appreciate).
Good replay value (cards, tiles, powers, incarnations, difficulty level... many features may change from each game to the next one).
Excellent solitaire.
Beautiful artwork.
Sloppy English rulebook.

Although this is a great game for the first couple of plays, it drys out fairly quickly. Our last few games were pretty scripted until the very end- there usually is a 'best' move in most situations.  The ending of the game is by far the best because there are multiple ways to kill the boss and different tactics to employ.  The rest of the game sort of feels like you're going through the motions and rolling with the punches.  The bosses add the much needed variety.

Edit: Started playing the game with 4 Taoists even with two players, makes for a much better game with more choices than with 2.

Lovely artwork and look. I like the layout of the game, pretty organized and easy to observe. Nice cooperative play and a bit on the tense side with monsters always appearing. A good game plan amongst the players is necessary and it appears that after a few games, you'll distill down to the same strategy everytime, so the game might not have that high replayability factor.

When I first played observing all the rules correctly (3rd time), I was effectively hammered by the game, as 3 very difficult monsters spawned at the very beggining of the game. I also lost on my second correct play, but I ALMOST won. I only lost due to a ridiculously unlucky ghost draw when I was about to kill the incarnation of Wu Feng.

I drew a ghost which brought another ghost to the table, and then I drew a ghost which kept one die for itself, leaving me with only one die (the first one had also been stolen by the incarnation) AND made me draw ANOTHER ghost. Then I drew one that prevented me from using any of my Tao tokens :(

After that, I didn't have the time to exorcise this last ghost and, then, with only 1 poor single die left, exorcise the incarnation: 1 - a previously drawn ghost cancelled the red monk's power and 2 - I had a haunted tile. When I exorcized the Tao token ghost, the curse die haunted another tile and, before I could reach the incarnation, 2 haunters haunted 2 more village tiles.

As people can realize by reading what is written above, this is a very thematic, tense and hard cooperative game, and it just feels awesome when an applied tactic works against the board.

Plus, the art is neat and the setup time is short.

The more players participate, the better. Simple mechanics, nice gameplay, lots of tension, moderate difficulty. Also, nice theme! After many plays I believe its pretty much solvable on normal difficulty and the element of luck can and should be mostly eliminated.

As with all the coops, there's a problem with overdominant players. Solution: give advice to other players only when on the same/adjacet tile. Becomes a bit more difficult, but ultimately more fun and rewarding when you win.

We ultimately beat the scenario we were playing but just barely.  From what I understand it gets harder and harder.  I'd like to get a copy of this and see how it plays after a few more trips to the table.
One of our buddies hated the game but that's no big surprise considering he's not a fan of co-op's.  He'll really only play Pandemic if he can be the Bio-Terrorist if that gives you any understanding.

Solitaire: Holy shit, this game. THIS GAME. The first day I got a chance to play it, I played it 10 times. I've never done that with any other game.

I had concerns about it after reading many reviews -- too random, too little feeling of progress, "Yahtzee with ghosts," etc. None of that was an issue for me. Sure, there's randomness: I've lost on a single die roll -- but that comes down to poor planning on my part more than simple chance. It's a puzzle, one with lots of pieces and things to tweak and never enough time to do all of it, and it's brilliant. And it looks great, with lots of color and a fantastic art style.

Solitaire is very well implemented. Apart from the useless cemetery, nothing about it feels off. It's a blast to play. Some village configurations make life more difficult, as do (of course) some draws and some powers. Everything matters, but it can all be worked around, and I learned something new in all of my first games.

Out of my first 10 plays on the lowest difficulty, I won 4 times (best score 26) and lost 6 times (worst score -39), a pleasant balance in my book. More importantly, I had fun losing. For a game notorious for its difficulty level, that's a good thing.

It's brutal and unrelenting in its pace at times, and it's rare that there's much breathing room -- a turn, maybe two if you're lucky. There are occasional easy choices, but sometimes I see later on that they seemed like easy choices but impacted the game in unexpected ways. Almost every turn involves a tough decision, but the option set is truncated sharply by the game state; that adds up to about a 30-45 minute solo game for me, which is a great timeframe.

Sitting here writing this comment on that same first day, I want to play it again right now. It's gotten its hooks into my brain with its perfect mix of challenge, luck, puzzle, and superb artwork and theme. 

It's not all roses, though. The rulebook is one of the worst I've seen, I suspect due to poor translation. BGG makes answering questions easy enough during play, but every other game or so I've discovered I'd been doing something slightly wrong or had missed a rule that got slipped in somewhere unexpected.

The components are also a mixed bag: gorgeous, but not all high-quality. The boards, minis, and tokens are all excellent, and look like they'll hold up well. The cards are thin, glossy, cheap-feeling, and show visible wear after a few plays. (I don't care, so unsleeved they'll stay.) And the dice -- yikes. Screened, not etched, and after a couple games the spots became sticky. For $50 MSRP that's a shame.

But. But! The game itself is so good that I don't care about the clunky rulebook or the mix of great/poor components. Maybe I should, but I'm too busy having fun to worry about it.

Ghost Stories is one of the most satisfying and enjoyable games I've ever played.

This game is hard.  We have yet to win.  We hate you so much Wu Feng.  You and your hordes of monsters cause us so much distress and pain.  We think we have the situation under control but eventually you screw us over.  But we keep coming back.  Are we masochists?  

No.  We keep coming back because despite losing all the time we have fun playing.  This game requires a bit of strategy and luck and is best played with 4 people.  Each priest has a unique ability that aids in battle and the villagers' abilities are a necessity as well.  The rulebook is sometimes unclear and a bit hard to understand but once you play a few times you'll really get how to play the game.

Great job Mr. Bauza.  You've created another hit.

RATING: 7
Elegant cooperative game. Everything fits together seamlessly. It's also quite atmospheric. You could argue that the gameplay (drawing of cards) is somewhat repetitive. But, I think you have quite a bit to chew on between draws, which makes up for the repetition. It's true that this game is HARD! I don't care how many games you've played or how intelligent you are, this game will always be tough to beat your first time. Interestingly, some of the special powers that seem more helpful at first glance are actually less helpful in retrospect. The game is always going to come down to the dice rolls. If you roll poorly, you cannot win. If you roll average, the odds are stacked against you. If you roll well, it's still not an easy game. The dice also make it a different game than something like Pandemic, because your are not just working against the cards, but the dice as well. Excellent game. I can see why it's so popular. 

Update 5/22/15: Unfortunately, the second time I played this game, I had to almost completely re-learn the rules. It's a very process-driven game, not a big idea game, so the ruleset can definitely escape you. It took about almost an hour to get through them. Once we started playing, we were more focused on playing the correct rules than enjoying the experience. Bottom line: this is a game you need to play multiple times and within a reasonable time frame to truly enjoy. That doesn't really fit into my wheelhouse, but I like the gameplay and the components enough to keep it around.

3 / 5 - Good.

There's a lot to like about Ghost Stories. The theme comes across well, partly thanks to the evocative and brilliantly done artwork, there's plenty of strategy to think about, a tough learning curve, plenty of variability and an interesting solo game. However I didn't find there was *quite* enough variation on hand to entirely kill the alpha-player problem that so dogs co-op games. I was also annoyed at the way the random incarnation can show up and totally torpedo your otherwise cunningly-played game just because it happens to be one of the more difficult ones.

Super difficult coop. Pretty fun if you don't mind losing all the time. This was my first coop purchase and I rather enjoy it. My only complaint is the component quality. Within a few months of owning this, the colored dice were completely worn out. I've had to use sharpies to restore them. Not cool.

Best game of 2008 and one of my top10 favorites.
The best co-op game. One of the best games in general.. It's by Bauza, probably the best designer there is too. Ghost Stories has perfect mix of Pandemic type of serious planning and then less serious dice-throwing that ultimately decides your faith. In other words perfect mix of strategy and luck. Cool components and theme (it's folklore so both fantasy and non-fantasy fans can enjoy it, I'm immersed at least). Rulebook could be bit better but the rules itself are simple. But it's still very challenging game, which is great because nothing is less replayable than easy co-op game. AND it has different difficulty levels, and then when you think you're done it even has very good expansion (White Moon) that brings it to next level that you'll probably never tire of. All the smaller promo expansions are very good too. Yeah, it's the best co-op game. 

2-Player Comment:
* Ghost Stories is co-op game. Great game with any player count. I prefer it with two actually.

Expansions:
+Ghost Stories Deluxe Dice
+Ghost Stories: White Moon
+Ghost Stories: Scenarios (Cursed Children & Green Roots)
+Ghost Stories: Promo Pack + Guardhouse & Ma-Cho Promos

OK, so I've mentioned how tough Defenders of the Realm is; well this is harder, much harder. I think we've won once. Maybe. But we keep coming back; possibly because it's one of my daughter's favourite games. Every now and again it's like, "let's have another go at Ghost Stories" and then it just punches us in the face again.

The theme is what does it - that sense of the Ghosts advancing on us and the nasty Ghosts persisting and doing nasty stuff - even when you beat them. Curse dice; argh! Black Widow; double-argh! All the different player powers are fun to use, none of them is just a filler, I never mind which one I get. We only play on intro level, I'm not sure that we'll EVER get to anything other. Great game, it'd score higher if we didn't just always get pummelled, so I can't give it "will always want to play" rating.

A tough co-op game even on normal difficulty.  Very vibrantly coloured, with random tile set up.  I can see a lot of replay value in it, for those who get into it.  While I like the theme, I don't think I'd find a place for it in my collection as a) I'm not that much of a masochist, and b) the iconography is more complex than I'd like for a co-op game - both of which make the game not great for non gamers.  Plus I already own pandemic.

One of my favorite cooperative games. It's really challenging, without feeling really unfair at all. Yes, you can lose because of a sequence of unlucky events, but you're more likely to either because of bad decisions, or because of taking on more risks than you should. That or just because the game wants you to lose. It happens. Tough luck. But it's always a great experience. The rules are very simple, which is always a bonus.

I had the same experience as with LotR: LCG. A frustrtaing experience for myself. These solo/cooperative puzzle games are just not my type of games.

The art is gorgeous and really gives a nice atmosphere, hence the 6.

Edit: downgraded rating LotR:LCG a bit. This game is better than LotR: LCG. This puzzle is actually doable (but still hard). Anyway: 'puzzlegames' (and maybe cooperative games in general) are not really my type of game.

Edit 2: LOTR-LCG is deckbuilding-luck, this is dice-luck. Adjusted the rating, due to Space Hulk CG I now appreciate these kind of games. I like dice-luck. ;)

INSANELY Difficult. Beautiful Art, original theme. If you like cooperative games you MUST play this. Luck is a factor, and hardly ever in your favor. Resource management is key, there are never enough of the right tokens to do what you need. There is no 'puzzle' to solve once, as ghost order, difficulty and best movement around the tiles changes each game. Lots of replay-ability.

I had not played this co-op before. You play Chinese ghost hunters fighting the forces of darkness. If the ghosts take over the village you lose. This is probably THE toughest co-op game I have ever played (Galactica doesn't come even close). The theme is quite nice, and I liked the desperation, but it is a game that will haunt your dreams. After two games you really feel like you went through a battle. The game has a high replay value, because it is tough to beat and fairly original. The girl who owned the game said she had played the game ~50 times and they had not beat it yet. We sort of came close, but not really.

Edit: Well, we finally won. This game is an onslaught of never ending horrors. It is pretty luck dependent, but beautiful. I don't mind luck in a game, but even optimal play is punished. This game can feel pretty "samey" after a few plays, because you get so few breaks from exorcising to take any other action.

This is a tough game. My first play, right out of the gate I was forced to draw three ghosts. On the FIRST TURN. At novice level. Having moved once. And I lost all my tokens because of a Curse. 

Three turns later, we were dead, having exorcized exactly NOTHING.

Oh, chaos, destruction and hopelessness. My favorite co-op, with the faint promise of glory, but if you manage to win that's the sweetest feeling.

Great coop game! Lots of variation, in particular with the expansions: different game-board, different special powers, different citizens, different ghosts, plus-of course-the order in which the latter two appear. Usually winnable, but always challenging. Just going out and hoping for the dice to roll right will simply crush you most of the time. I wish the rules were done better to make it more accessible.

Really solid game mechanically, but a little lacking in the fun factor. Feels a bit too much like solving a puzzle. The game isn't as hard as people say, but only if you approach it as a puzzle rather than a game and make sure to always make optimal moves, which sucks out some of the fun and theme. Also, replayability is just so-so since there's not too much variety in the ghosts. I want to call this a "good" game, but I just never find myself in the mood to play it. Very susceptible to "quarterbacking."

Game in a Nutshell:  Play as Monks fighting off ghosts with the help of villagers that are threatening your small village.

Played as:  2,4 player

Pros:  Has a fun theme that should appeal to most anyone. Very nice artwork on all the tiles and cards. The plastic bits are excellent, especially the ghosts who lean over the threatened tiles as if to swallow them up.

Cons:  The game has enough niggly little rules to remember, as is. But to have a terrible rule book that offers messy (at best) to non-existent clarification is a substantial set-back in the accessibility of the game.  There’s something strangely unnatural about the flow of play, or maybe that’s just an extension of the poor rules clarification and lack of a good player-aid. The board layout is too abstract for my tastes, offering little connection to what’s happening on the table. It just looks like a jumbled mess of cardboard and plastic.  After only a couple games, I’m not sure where the variety is going to come from going forward (sans money-grab expansions)... the modular board is too small to really mix anything up and the ghosts are like the Taco Bell menu: same five ingredients, just layered in a different order. Overall, I found there to be a lot of the same-same, with no visual connection, and a surprising lack of real excitement.

Other:  Maybe I’ve been lucky in my limited play experience, but I’ve found the game to be much easier than advertised.  I think a few straight-forward strategies can take players a long way.  I won’t say that’s a con yet until I’ve played a few more times. Also, it’s worth noting, I have spent far too much time making sure I’ve got the rules right and haven’t found any major mistakes.

Best Use:  If you’re a co-op nut and you’ve burned out on all your other options already.

You've heard already that this game is hard. I concur: I've never won the game yet. It feels similar to Pandemic in that any problem you ignore seems to go from bad to worse quickly (and you're going to have to choose to ignore some sometimes, because there you're battling on all fronts). But in Pandemic you can seem to keep the situation almost under control and that almost never seems to be the case in Ghost Stories.

I like the challenge. The game mechanics work smoothly, but it seems a little confusing at first because the theme doesn't really help very much to explain how it all works. It's pretty abstract, but it's a good abstract.

This was kind of a disappointment, not because it was bad, but because it was a rather non-immersive puzzle game. I didn't experience any thematic immersion, and it was rather dry: not at all what I was expecting and hoping for.

It's got lovely components and a great idea. But it just doesn't grab you and pull you in, and it's also quite difficult.

A Touch of Evil and Arkham Horror and the like are true experience games. This is not. I got a free copy of it and played the library copy at a convention. Then I immediately traded my still-shrinked copy for Tales of the Arabian Nights.

Board Game Warriors - traded Diplomacy + $20

This game is strange to me.  I can't decide whether I really like it, or only sort of like it.

It's not easy to pick up and play, and it's not an easy game to teach to new people and then enjoy.  You need to play a few games before everyone really "gets it" and can make sound decisions on their own.

I am slightly embarrassed to admit that I have played the solo game, and less embarrassed to say that it actually works pretty well.  I lost the first time 5 minutes in, but won the second time after only about 30 minutes.  And it was more entertaining then a game of card solitaire.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't play "advanced" games.  It's not easy to learn, it's not easy to pick up and start playing.  It needs a real time investment to be enjoyable.  And I have yet to see if the invested time is really worth the effort.

RATING: 8.5
Finally brought this to the table. Very, very addictive. We got a couple of important rules wrong (and so the game was a little too easy, even for the introductory difficulty) but these will be fixed in the next game. 

Exorcising ghosts is immensely satisfying, and the encourages teamwork, but doesn't completely depend on it, meaning the game doesn't appear to suffer as much from the same problem as other cooperative titles: that is, that someone can take charge. 

The game offers tense gameplay, and although it was somewhat easy in our incorrect-rule introductory session, it's clear this is going to be a hard slog on the higher difficulty levels. The battle with Wu-Feng seemed a little too easy at the end, however this may be due to the aforementioned rule confusion. The concept is brilliant though: the major boss battle combined with a simple game-driven time limit makes for a very climactic end to the game.

Just a note though: whatever you do, download the one-page reference sheet from the Ghost Stories files on BGG. Sharing one copy of the quick-reference and handbook manuals included with the game would have been a nightmare considering all the various icons and player/villager/enemy powers.

All in all, even with casual gamers (including my girlfriend, who is fairly picky when it comes to thematic games), all 4 players were thoroughly entertained and eager to play it again. A sign of a truly great game.

Love it.  Good combination of theme, abilities, working together, artwork, and challenge.  Most games we do not win, but that makes the occasional victory even sweeter.  We were lulled by several victories in our first set of attempts, but they were a fluke.

RATING: 6.75
Fun cooperative game.  generates tension with relentless onslaught of enemy cards.  Does not let up, which is cool.  The rulebook is pretty awful, and the art is not my favorite, with iconography everywhere with a faux oriental theme which does more to make things harder to play than anything to no real benefit.  Still, we had fun and would like to play again.

RATING: 8
A co-op I really like, even solo. The game is hard, and the deck is stacked against you. At least I know when I play it that I'm not going to have it easy, and that increases the tension for every decision I make. Not one for the faint of heart or for players that don't like to be "played" by the game system.

The deck of cards to fight is a little bit too long. The game is nice the first time, but very repetitive, also because you are very seldom going to use the board actions as fighting against the most dangerous enemy is much more important. Of course luck has a very important role.

Punishing, and very fun to pull off a victory by the skin of your teeth.  It's almost as fun solo, which I prefer to play with all 4 taoists.  I love the theme, and the artwork is really fantastic.

14-Oct-2016:  A couple of quick comments about White Moon:
•  It definitely takes the edge off the base game's notorious difficulty.
•  It also adds to the game's fiddliness for both setup and gameplay but not to the point where I found it annoying. 
•  This is an easy recommend, especially if you feel like the base game is just a bit too mean.  Not a necessity but an expansion that adds a lot of additional options for the player.

17-Feb-2013:  This is an excellent, and tough, cooperative game where you are a group of Taoist monks fighting off a (seemingly) never ending onslaught of ghosts. These evil beings are sent from the depths of the Underworld by the banished Wu Feng. Using various powers and help from the Villagers, the monks, if they survive long enough, will have to fight one of the reincarnations of Wu Feng (the "big bad") to win the game.

This is a tactics heavy game. You will need to deal with a constant barrage of ghosts being added to the board, each with their set of powers and actions. It is almost kin to a tower defense game as at least one ghost will be added on every monk's turn. You will have to exorcise them by using dice and special tokens, matching the varying strengths of the ghosts.

The randomness of set up, differing abilities, what ghosts and what order they come out during play, and which incarnation (or incarnations at higher difficulty levels) of Wu Feng you must defeat add to the replayability and my enjoyment of this one. The artwork is very good. The theme is unique. The quality of all of the tiles and chits are great. The only minor complaint I have with the components is the quality of the cards. They're pretty poor, but you do only shuffle them prior to gameplay and that's all, so it shouldn't be a problem in the long run.

A tense cooperative game that's tough to win.  Clever design with some great special powers and tactical choices.  Some will not be enamored by the dice rolling but I thought it added another level of tension.  Did I mention it's tough -- you can all be cruising along just fine, exorcising ghosts and then boom: you're overrun with spirits.

Often it made the most sense for my hunter and others to stay put.  This was frustrating as I wanted to move around the board more.  Hoping the replayability doesn't diminish too quickly -- guessing it won't due to the challenge it presents and the opportunity to expand the system.

This did not really click for me.  I really felt like there were not any interesting decisions to make, especially late in the game.   Most of the time you were confined to one area rolling dice.  Also, I did not like that in the two games that I played there was very little use of the villagers, except when a monk used the yin/yang token.  

Possible that I got a rule or two incorrect.   I would like to try it again, but I think this game is not for me.

Fantastic components.

***** UPDATE *****

I think I am giving up on this and moving it to the 'for trade/sale' pile.   I am not sure why, but it appears that this will never click for me.  Did not like it solo or with multiple players.

Just fell flat for me in the end.  I like the simple mechanics and the gameplay is interesting, but the end bosses just don't seem that hard.  Maybe my opinion would change if I tried the harder levels, but  I want a big battle at the end with a much harder opponent in this kind of a game and it just wasn't there.  Wierd because I love Pandemic, and the theme is better here.  You would think I would like this more, but I feel like it isn't in the same class even though they are both co-op games.  This feels like it should be an adventure game with a big fight at the end.

"I would best compare the difficulty to end-game of Shadows Over Camelot -- where you are constantly 2 turns away from defeat. Ghost Stories certainly felt like that, and effective use of the city tiles will probably come with experience and lots of losing."

RATING: 9.5
This is one of my favorite games. I love the theme (I watched all those spectacular kung-fu/ supernatural B movies!) It's really fun to play and it hits a sweet spot in weight- perfect middle. It offers a more rewarding experience than its complexity should allow. The only thing keeping this game from being a 10 for me: I really only like playing it with exactly four players, which limits the occasions for play. I think anyone who has played will admit it doesn't feel right with any other player count. If you enjoy coop gaming, you really should play it!

An ingenious and very original short-length logical game with some elemets of luck and beautifully achieved theme. Components are top quality! As you learn how to play the game, luck starts having a lot less influence on the outcome! Theme fades into the background after some time though, as you start focusing more on the logical aspect. It takes over ten games to start getting the hang of it, so the game doesn't get stale. Also, difficulty levels present new challenges, and what seemed impossible might feel too easy after the level is mastered. Cooperation is necessary if Wu-Feng is to be defeated! Kudos, simple yet involving!

Best cooperative game I've played so far. In fact, probably the only co-op I'm motivated to play again. I haven't yet put my finger on what sets it so substantially apart from the others, but I suspect it is the investment I have in keeping my fellow players (rather than just cubes and invisible population) out of danger. This game is tense and frantic and fun.

Amazing! Amazing, amazing, amazing! Admittedly, we played the first 5 games, over multiple sessions, wrong.. We thought diagonal movement wasn't allowed. This is probably because I scanned through the rules and seeing this line in red, assumed red = not allowed.. Saying that, even in our uber difficult 2p games of orthagonal movement. We STILL loved the game! Now that movement has been unlocked for us, the future is brighter than ever!!

Colorful, actually too colorful; and difficult, too difficult really. Muddled rules. There's an unfortunate lather-rinse-repeat quality to fending off the relentless ghosts, until the big bad boy suddenly appears near the end without a sense of climax. If you make it that far. . . Brutal, frustrating, not very fun after repeatedly getting pummeled. Playing solo works just as well if not better than multi-player. [13 plays; sold]

Finally a co-op game that gets it right - first, it's so damn hard that we have yet to win it - which means it's not solvable, at least not in the same way LOTR or Pandemic is, second, the theme supported by the brilliant art just makes me feel like Ol' Jack Burton, uzi in hand, punching that ancient Chinese evil in the face. That's right, you heard me, this isn't about Shaolin monks fighting asian ghosts, this is Big Trouble in Little China the board game. And though I will probably play it many many many many times and lose, all I got t'remember is, what ol' Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, and the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake. Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big ol' storm right square in the eye and he says, "Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it."

My wife & I don't play cooperative games often -- and Pandemic has accounted for all but 1 of our coop game plays -- so we don't have much to compare against Ghost Stories. Relative to Pandemic, I liked all of the different player powers and villager tile powers in Ghost Stories -- it led to many instances where we'd come up with several different options that we'd need to choose from. I felt that kind of situation occurred more than it does when we play Pandemic, and I enjoy that kind of thinking.

On the other hand, I like that it's easier to plan ahead in Pandemic because you know you'll see the same cities cycling through after an epidemic. With Ghost Stories, however, you never know what's coming so all you can do is constantly react. So while we enjoyed the game, I'm not sure yet whether it's a keeper.

Reasonably simple yet tense and fast-paced cooperative game. Feels a bit like Pandemic but different mechanically and with a different ebb and flow. Its fun to dash around the town frantically, beating back the ghosts. The game mechanics could be applied to almost any theme but the ghost theme is well presented through the great components. Every time I play this I'm enjoying it a bit more.

RATING: 4.4
As a tremendously difficult to win co-operative game this hits the mark.
However, whereas when playng Pandemic you always think you can achieve victory until the card that destroys all your hopes is turned over, with Ghost Stories you can see your destruction creeping up on you as the cards are turned over. This means that you know you are going to fail early on in the game and then just struggle to stay alive as long as you can. This leaves me with the feeling of "what is the point of going on? We can't win, so why not just re-start the game or play something more enjoyable?"

Ghost Stories manages to eliminate the Alpha Gamer problem that can plague these games by ensuring that there are almost always at least two (and sometimes three or four) equally viable moves to make. 

You really feel like you're part of a team of Taoist warriors, desperately trying to beat back the ghostly hordes from a small rural village in ancient China. 

The artwork and production values are a step above. A lot of hard decisions and twists of fate packed into a game that plays in an hour (or less if you get defeated). 

I usually don't enjoy solo games, either, but you can have a good time with one player in Ghost Stories. I have no doubt I'll spend many more hours on this one. 

Damn you, Wu Feng!!!

Played: About 24 times, including half a dozen solo games.

UPDATE: Bumping up from an 8 to a 9 after further play. This may change down the road, but right now I always want to play this game. I really enjoy how brutally difficult this is along with the hard choices you are presented with in every game. Never thought I would rate a cooperative game this high.

A co-op game that works well due to the improbability of there being a single "best" course of action that could be scripted by a single player; a.k.a. leader.

I really quite like the puzzle in this game. But I'm undecided yet on if I think the luck is too high for the difficulty level. Yes, the game is pretty damned tough. But I sometimes feel that you can play the whole game really well only to have that ruined by one wrong card coming up. It also snowballs very quickly once things start turning against you. Glad that someone else in my group owns it as I do enjoy it, but don't want to play it all the time.

A co-operative game where the players endeavour to save the village from the threat of ghosts by utilising the powers of the village people. 

This is a really neat game that is easy to learn after 1-2 games and the artwork is fantastic.

I've only played the introductory game but with multiple difficulty levels, multiple Wu-Fengs to battle in the main game and the ability to play this solo or multi-player -  Ghost Stories gets added to my must buy list.

Based on only one play it seemed ok, but maybe a bit busy: we didn't have time to get anything done and the game seemed to be over before it even begun in earnest. 

That MIGHT have been just bad luck, since we got several of the tile flipper ghosts in a row: six of them (or so) in our 2-player game was a bit much. But still... 

I don't know, maybe after Pandemic (and Forbidden Island, which I don't play if I can play Pandemic) the game just seemed a bit redundant. Sure, there are more tactics involved here, but I don't know, felt a bit like the game was playing me. I really like the art, visually I find it cooler than the Leacock co-ops, but on the other hand the symbols seemed a bit groggy, at least at first.

I'll surely play again if asked, but I prefer Pandemic.

On first contact, Ghost Stories looks and sounds lovely. After understanding its premise, you're probably quite interested in playing it, provided you have survived the poorly laid out rulebook. The only tiny problem is that, how shall I put it... the balance is all over the place, in a really hardcore way. The only time I ever won included all the following:

    We played on the tutorial difficulty.
    We were not at max player count. (The game scales horribly and most players claiming to have a nice win rate probably play solo rather than 4 players.)
    We chose our monk powers. (Some of them are almost strictly worse than their alternative.)
    We got really nice ghost draws in early game and haunters were spaced out.
    We drew the easiest-to-beat incarnation of Wu Feng.
    We got a rule wrong, resulting in a player losing 8 less Qi over the course of the game than he should have. (For the uninitiated, that means we should have lost horribly.)

Perhaps there are some arcane strategic choices that we're unable to see, but as far as I'm concerned, Ghost Stories only understands that players dislike cooperative games that are beaten too easily; therefore it absolutely ensures that you will get wrecked over and over and over again, only able to win with the conjunction of near-optimal play and a statistically abnormal amount of luck. I'm not that masochistic.

I had completely written this game off despite the glowing review by Tom Vasel until I watched Richard Ham's run through. While I am not a fan of the creepiness of the ghouls on the cards the game play looks fantastic and the Budda pieces and the tile art are wonderful. This looks like an easy to learn/play co-op that would provide some variety after the Forbidden Island/Desert series.

By now we should know already that the haunted Chinese rice fields are no place for a bunch of helpless Tao idiots like us, but no... just like the haunted armada of Chinese ghosts we are relentless, which means in our case: we never learn, we want to play this game over and over again just for the single purpose to get our asses kicked every time we do so! Almost no downtime, lots of tactical decisions to be made and a very focussed player interaction make this game a wonderful winner to me! Love it.

RATING: 8
Exciting mile-a-minute cooperative game where players have to cooperate to defend a besieged village from the titular asian ghosts. Share actions, resources and hope you don't get overrun. 

Fun, exciting and simple yet deep gameplay. Threatens to be a "mechanics only" euro-exercise, but successfully blends in the asian theme to the point where it justifies its miniatures & chits.

Personally I would have preferred a more serious tone to the artwork instead of the cartoony look they went for, but I guess that makes the game more accessible to the mainstream crowd. Get it!

RATING: 8
In this 1-4 player cooperative game, players are a Taoist, combating Chinese ghosts. Each turn, a player draws a ghost card, and places it. There are 9 villages where players can enlist help, such as grabbing tokens to defeat ghosts, or automatically killing ghosts at a cost of a life. Players can also wander adjacent to ghosts and roll dice to attempt to kill the ghosts. Players win by killing a Wu Feng ghost (a top tier ghost), and the ghosts win by hanuting a number of villages or killing off the Taoists. There are four difficulty levels (Initiation, Normal, Nightmare, Hell), which handicaps the life tokens players start with or the number of Wu Feng ghosts they have to kill to win.

This is a difficult but very fun, and engaging game, but I like the idea that it is difficult to win, since it is challenging.

As a strategy tip, we found making the blue player go first so they can use a double action on the buddha square, or the square to get two tokens works well, then have another player go to the square to put on a permanent token of a color.

Yes, the rules don't take care of the myriad of special cases that can arise, but the designer is making an effort to answer them here.

Ghost Stories can be hard to win - even at the lowest difficulty level - and that makes all co-operative games better. I don't like co-operative games that are too easy and Ghost Stories isn't one of those. When starting a game, it might seem easy but the ghosts just keep coming, and coming, and coming - and that's why this is such an excellent game.

Played a pretty close game where we had a 4/9 chance of beating the boss or so in a normal 4p mode and was nice and close. I think we mayve won if we timed our yinyangs better but otherwise, this game was pretty decent. I think though that one major issue with co ops for me is the AI in most co ops relies on dice or card flips (unless uou have deduction or memory ones like hanabi but i tend to dislike both those genres since im not good at them) and that feels a lot more random and out of my control. It also fluctuates a lot more than player made randomness via choices. Anyway point is co ops arent my cup of tea.

Plays: 1 its was decent enough and would play if asked but probably wouldnt actively seek it out

RATING: 8
This is a very keenly designed and unexpectedly abstract co-op game, with a wonderful and original (if slightly shallowly attached) theme laid on top, which was my initial draw towards it. It is very tactical and requires a great deal of attention in terms of what moves and actions each player can afford to play and when, since it is very unforgiving of mistakes or poor dice rolling.

However, as beautiful and intriguing as the game is I am not yet convinced of its longevity when compared to other co-op games such as Arkham Horror, partially due to the more abstract nature of the gameplay and partly because I do like longer games. If it does stand the test of time along with my other solo/co-op games, (or if you prefer shorter games in general) then this game should definitely get a 9 instead of an 8 though. 

But it loses a big point because the rulebook (at least in the first printing) is horrid. Poorly laid out and full of information that is either not clear enough, mis-directing in its examples, or plain mis-translated. It requires copious amounts of time reading FAQs and rules postings in order to actually play "correctly", and for such a mechanically simple game this makes for a lot of unneeded frustration.

Still, after getting past the problems it is addictive, very clever and great to look at, and regardless of its lifespan I am already getting my money's worth in sheer enjoyment.

A tentative 7 rating based on one play on the 3D board at the 2009 GoF. I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if it could sustain my interest.

We got our asses handed to us, but had a great time anyway - that's the measure of a quality game in my book!

This game has a great theme that really brings out the kung fu fighter in me. The need to communicate and work together as a team is absolutely essential in order to win.

A household favourite thanks to my brother for getting my husband and I hooked on it one summer. We love that it has the cooperative intensity of Arkham Horror, but without the 4 hour gameplay and 20 minute setup. 

Our Rating Guide (1 = Disappointed, 3=hit&miss, 5= Owned it!)

1. Originality - 5 - Taoist Monks who use magical superpowers to save villages from evil ghosts. Enough said!  

2. Artwork - 5 - The cards are all unique and beautifully terrifying. The tiles are classy. The game pieces are functional.

3. Quality of Contents - 5 - For how often we've played, this game pulls through. Yes, there's some wear on the card edges, but overall I'm not worried that I'll miss out on teaching my grandchildren how to play. Yeah, I want to be that grandma - screw you cribbage!

4. Storyline - 5- Again, Taoist Monks who use magical superpowers to save villages from evil ghosts. Enough said!  

5. Playthrough - 5- Even when this game kicks my butt mercilessly, the first words out of my mouth are "again!" The rule book can be a bit frustrating, but once you get all of the symbols figured out, you won't need to go back to it again because really all of the details are in the game play.

6. Instructions - 3 - it's like reading an IKEA manual. 

7. Replayability - 5 - again and again and again!
	
8. Two player - 5 - Usually it's just my husband and I, or me teaching another person. It almost works better because you can use power tokens that let you use non-playing characters' powers.

9. Large Group 4 player max - not for a crowd.

10. Fun Factor - 5 - again and again and again!

A lot of downtime. we had a couple of extensions with. As a green monk I played 5 or 6 times in the entire game. each time I killed a host and still we never had a chance to win. in any case, playing 6 actions only in a game lasting more than an hour is quite wrong too. While there might be something about this game, I felt that something was clearly out of balance. I could play again to find out what is wrong, but I'm most likely to skip the game.

I like coops so I bought this one as soon as I saw it in a local store. Maaaan am I dissapointed!! Don't feel the tension at all. Obviously I see the ghosts haunting the town, i see that we're gonna lose......but so what.....I really don't care. The ghost cards are monotonous and the game really lacks any exitement. I'll give it another try or two. If it doesn't work out, than its gonna join the "cemetary" of my collection of games never to be played again.

Excellent cooperative game, if you're looking for a serious challenge, and extremely rewarding in terms of bragging rights (beaten the Nightmare mode, but not the Hell mode yet)! However, you probably want to make sure that each player around the table is about the same level as this game is prone to the "alpha player" syndrome. Solid theme, in which you really get the feeling of being constantly overwhelmed by enemies. Another great title from Antoine Bauza! Best recommended with 4 players as the dummy mechanics for missing players are kinda dull.

A pretty engaging co-op.  There are ghost enemies on all four sides of the board, each being owned by a player.  The 9 town spots in the center all have special abilities, and the monks go around to fight the ghosts with dice.  The monks also have special abilities.  

The game is an interesting co op that presents itself as a big puzzle to solve, but I think I am sick of co ops perhaps?  I still enjoy Pandemic, and would rather play that and solve that puzzle than this puzzle.

ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL co-op game that will either reinforce or completely negate your opinions on co-op games, depending on what you've played before.  You simply have no choice but to co-operate if you plan to have ANY chance of defeating this game.  Simply put, so much can go so horribly wrong so horribly quickly -- I seriously believe that there are games that are guaranteed losses, based on the luck of the deck.  How well you do depends on how much you can depend on things that aren't dice, time is definitely not on your side, and even the BEGINNER'S level of this game will make you sweat if you don't understand the importance of each and every gear in motion.

I have owned this game for close to 5 years, I have played it several times during that period, and I have beaten Wu-Feng exactly one time.

The primary issue is, due to its incredible difficulty, the "dominant player" syndrome comes out even stronger in this one.  There's room for maybe 3 sub-optimal moves in Ghost Stories and dominant players are going to pipe up every time a move is made.

This is a great game. Looks very hard to beat (to me, so far) and it has a good mix of luck, reaction and mid-term tactics. You really can't make long term plans on this one, but then again, that's the game. One night fighting ghosts from hell. That is bound to be chaotic and if the game didn't beat you down relentlessly, I think it would feel odd. I must have watched Big Trouble in Little China dozens of times in my youth, so the theme works for me too.

Oh, those rules (especially the German ones) are bad.
So, no question, we played it wrong (to our disadvantage) in our first game. 
But the second game was lost as well, using correct rules ...

Not a fan of coops with a fixed difficulty. That is, the game doesn't change in any way as you progress, you just exhaust your resources. Arkham horror has this problem, too. Pandemic does not.

RATING: 4
Played this on the basic difficulty. I'm not that impressed. While there seem to be a wide variety of options to choose from, the game really is dependent on a large number of dull dice rolls. The massive number of symbols you need to memorize is also a significant barrier to learning this game, and makes the first game drag even longer.

RATING: 5.5
Simple rules, but the many powers and icons make learning how to play challenging...

Very well designed, the luck factor is important, but as much as it seems. Your decisions certainly matter.

The graphic design is A+.

But I find it quite repetitive, I get bored of killing ghosts before the end. I would like it much more if it were half as long.

RATING: 7
Forget those medieval skirmishes of Shadows Over Camelot.  This game is pure evil and is relentlessly trying to kill you.  I've never played a cooperative game that actually makes me think that the game itself is a living breathing monstrosity that hates all living things and has decided to take it out on me and the other players.  And that's just using the beginner's rules.  We keep playing, though, in spite of the fact that we have never actually won a game.  Until then I'm going to keep it tightly chained up in my closet in case it decides to kill me in my sleep.

RATING: 8
First impression (3 players): It's a cooperation game with a ghost theme. Your task is it banish incarnation of a powerful spirit but before you can do that you must stay alive until he'll appear. On the plus side the game isn't too easy (it might be too hard actually..). The struggling is half a game. If this would be too easy it wouldn't be as fun. 

Ghost Stories suffers from the cooperation game basic problem: One (experienced) player can play the game by himself if needed. There is no hidden information. Also basic gameplay might became repetetive and a bit mechanical after a few plays. Game works well with 3 players but it's best when played with full 4 players. Four might be the sweet spot for difficulty too.

The game is sadistically hard. It is hard even with easiest difficulty level. I don't know what it tells about me but I want to play more! Not sure how long-lived Ghost Stories will be but it has been enormously fun to play so far.

Update (24.1.2010) : The game is hard. 7 games now and no victory for heroes (easiest level of difficulty). Also me and the rules for the game are incompatible as I'm always getting at least one tiny rule wrong when playing. This is partly because I don't own the game and playing someone else's copy so there hasn't been any quick reference / faq printed along like in my games.

Probably the best solo game I've played. Pandemic, Arkham Horror, Lord of the Rings, etc, are all great co-op games, and I probably like Pandemic and AH overall a bit better, but this is a really great solo. Rating may go down after more plays but so far I'm a huge fan. As a non solo co-op game the rating goes down to 6.5 or 7.

RATING: 8
A very tough cooperative game, with gorgeous artwork.

Gameplay feels a bit mechanical: Draw a ghost card, move your pawn. The difficulty level probably makes up for a lot of that, though.

The rulebook has some ambiguities, as can be seen from the number of rules questions posted in the game forum. The component quality is fine but the cards are thin.

Edit: Raised the rating to eight after further testing. The tension is really intense.

En voilà un bon jeu de coopération qui ne paye pas de mine.
Le thème me plait beaucoup et les illustrations sont de toute beauté.
Le propre des jeux en coopératif est qu'ils peuvent être joués soit en solo ou à plusieurs. Pour le coup, ce n'est pas très arrangeant de jouer seul à Ghost Stories : les plateaux des autres joueurs absents sont "neutres" et sont accessibles par le jeu mais surtout par les fantômes. Pour moi je trouve que cela créé un déséquilibre par toujours facile à jauger ou à réquilibrer par le paquet de cartes fantôme à gérer.
Plateau général de jeu est original et bien pensé. Sauf un ou deux villageois qui me semblent pas vraiment indispensables, le reste des villageois est bien pensé.
On prend du plaisir à gérer l'urgence de ces fantômes hanteurs qui arrivent de toute part.
Il y a pas mal de jets de dés : le systèmes d'objets à sacrifier pour les plus handicapés du dé d'entre nous est bien pensé.
Le matériel est impeccable, que ce soit les figurines, les cartes "glassées", les tuiles et les marqueurs.
De façon générale j'ai bien aimé y jouer mais il me semble qu'on commence à bien rigoler à partir de 3 joueurs.

My rating will go up or down on this one, that is for sure, since I am on the fence about it as it stands.

While I like the theme on this one better than Pandemic, which is sad, because there is probably more ghostly themed games than ones about viral outbreaks, it still suffers from the quarterbacking syndrome plagued by all co-op games that do not have a traitor mechanic. Still I found myself enjoying it, even if I often was doing a little bit of quarterbacking. The rules were not perfect. In fact I had to consult BGG to get clarification on a big one, what happens to the cool Shagul like haunting figurines when you kill the ghost generating them. In the rules its sort talks about it, but not enough clarity for my liking.

Oh boy...this one is strangely addictive! I thought Pandemic was a very difficult game to beat! I thought that some of the GOO's and situations in Arkham really made Arkham Horror difficult to beat! And now...this! Ghost Stories is really difficult to beat...no doubt about it! 

The game is relatively simple...kill the deadly monsters or be killed! I like this game because it is somewhat fresh in mechanics, nice design-artwork-components, and it has a fairly steady stream of game play! The strategy of when to use Chi and Ying/Yang is extremely important to your survival. Collecting tao tokens and Buddhas...when there is time...is most difficult...but essential! Tricky game of timing, luck, group strategy, and...yes...survival!

The game hates you, but that's a good thing. There's something about the way this game plays that makes it feel personal - like it's YOU the game wants to kill, not just an abstract sense of trying to beat the system.  Yes, the underlying mechanics are abstract, but no you don't feel that way in the slightest when playing.  A very fresh-feeling design.

心得:
腳色能力差異略大
如果沒有使用四個人
有些腳色能力相對較廢會增加難度
遊戲主要策略點在移動鬼使得可以一次驅逐兩隻才划算

規則:
*鬼牌的左下是進場效果，中間是每回合效果，右下是離場效果，左上是生命，右上是顏色
*隨機擺置中央成為3x3的村莊版圖，另外四塊圖版隨機放置上下左右，隨機玩家顏色跟能力(對應圖版面)，每個玩家拿四氣(沒有上限)跟1個陰陽標記，1個自己顏色跟1個黑色的道標記，所有棋子放在中央村莊，兩個玉佛標記放在對應村莊
*魔王卡10抽1，放在鬼怪卡最下面10張上(45鬼怪-1魔王-10鬼怪)
*由最近看過功夫片的起始，每個玩家輪流動作，一次有兩階段
A.陰階段
1.主動玩家的圖板上鬼怪使用中間能力
>鬧鬼: 卡上前進一格，在圖板上則對應村莊鬧鬼，板塊翻面，鬼怪放回卡上，效果直達整行
>鬼骰: 扔骰看結果 直接村莊鬧鬼/抽一張鬼牌/該玩家棄光所有道標記/該玩家失去1氣
2.如果該玩家圖版有3隻鬼，則該玩家失去1氣並跳過抽鬼階段
3.抽一張鬼牌，紅綠藍黃鬼到對應顏色玩家圖版，黑色則直接到主動玩家圖版，如果滿了就隨意放，並啟動左下效果，如果全部12格都滿還要補鬼時主動玩家失去1氣
B.陽階段
1.移動一步 可對腳 可不動
2.村莊能力或驅跟該村莊相鄰的鬼 ，驅鬼擲三顆色骰，必須擲出對應鬼耐力的顏色骰才成功(白面是百搭)，可用道標記補足，邊角處可一次驅逐兩隻，可使用同村莊的其他人道標記
3.之前回合有的話可放玉佛在沒鬼的位置，邊緣可一次放兩個，當鬼要到該塊時直接移除遊戲，卡片上效果無視，玉佛則放回村莊
*陰陽標記隨時可用 使用其他格的村莊能力或是把鬧鬼村莊復原，用完就翻面蓋著只能藉由某些鬼的獎勵拿回
*沒氣的玩家掛點放在祭壇村莊上，棄掉所有他的物品，可被其他人復活，且該玩家的陰階段1跟2還是會執行
*魔王牌視為一個鬼牌放在對應顏色位置，要完全符合條件才能驅逐並獲勝，且不受巫術小屋跟玉佛影響，如果有玉佛直接擺回原村莊，每張打爆都會獲得1氣1陰陽標記並可決定誰拿
*勝利條件驅逐魔王牌，失敗條件 全掛/三個村莊鬧鬼/最後一張鬼牌抽出
*難度調整可每人起始5氣
***道士能力***
*黃 1.移動前可放標記在任何鬼上降1防禦力，多色的可在擲骰後決定降哪一個 2.移動前可拿任意一種顏色的道標記
*紅 1.移動前可移動隊友一步 2.可移動到任意格
*藍 1.可做兩次村莊或兩次驅鬼行動 2. 可做一次村莊和一次驅鬼行動
*綠 1.驅鬼可多擲一顆骰，且永不擲詛咒骰 2.可重擲骰一次或重擲詛咒骰
***1~3人規則****
*2~3人時，沒有玩家的版圖放3氣，每個玩家多拿一個力量標記，兩人是要在對面，2/3人時移除10/5張鬼牌
*Solo 移除15張鬼牌，各色標記各一，起始難度在多1黑，拿3個力量標記
*使用力量標記可使用中立板圖的道師能力，使用後標記放在中間村莊，踩到中央時可拿回手，死掉也會把力量標記放中間
*中立板圖會執行陰的前兩個階段，抽鬼牌階段不會執行，且氣消失補不回來，如果沒氣就不能使用該版圖能力，之後掉氣要選擇任一玩家掉
**難度**
*普通  起始3氣，且沒有黑色標記
*噩夢 起始跟普通一樣，增加魔王卡，1~2人使用3張，3~4人使用4張(牌庫底開始每10張插1張)
*地獄 跟惡夢一樣，起始沒有陰陽標記

Thematic, engaging and no one is left out of the fun. With some cooperative games, there is always the chance a player can commandeer the game which makes it fun for no one. But no one can keep track of all the player's special abilities or the villager's powers so it takes the full compliment of your team to solve the puzzle of eliminating ghosts from your village. The rulebook isn't intuitive but Ghost Stories is a better game played than studied. Great artwork, great components, this is a good game to end the day of competitive Euros and 4x games.

Picked a copy of Ghost Stories up after the good reviews that it got on BGG.

A great cooperative game with newcomers or experienced gamers.

Half a dozen plays in and we're trying to crack Nightmare level. It's pure co-op, so really it's all about trying to determine the ultimate strategy for the board you're faced with, and then executing it with luck. The challenge is ... how best to place ghosts to allow you to take advantage of village actions as often as possible whilst keeping the ghosts under control. Not for everyone, but we've enjoyed the "what could we do better next time" post-mortems. The lack of a traitor means it's purely an exercise though.

Pros: Fast & exciting co-op with lots of options/decisions and a great theme.

To win you pretty much can't make a single non-optimal move. During 95% of your turns, you will be trying to prevent an immediate danger/ risk. Because of this dynamic you almost never get to do ANY planning ahead, you are just constantly responding the highest priority risk. I feel this is the major setback for this game, which is otherwise a lot of fun. There is some puzzling to figure out, but often the highest priority risk makes for straight forward decision making.  Also, I feel it becomes substantially easier with fewer players as you can just keep re-taking the power token thingos from the center tile. The fewer players, the more tokens that can be utilised in this way. I don't get all the 'its to hard' comments though. It's very easy to find many ways to adjust the difficulty if players decide they need to.

This was a cooperative game based on fighting off ghosts and demons in an Asian setting.  The theme and art were very cool, but I'm not a fan of cooperative games.  This one in particular seemed much harder than it needed to be.  With at least one bad guy coming out every turn, and it being exceedingly difficult to defeat more than one of them in a turn (often, taking out just one was difficult), being overrun seems inevitable.

Great game. I like the fact that players get weaker as the game progresses, not stronger. Very thematic.

Not the best manual, but there are some rules summaries on BGG that help a lot with clarification on how the game should be played.

After we grasped a few basic strategies the game flows quickly from turn to turn and there's little downtime, even in a 4-player game.

It's OK as a two player game if both of the players take control of two monks each.

The idea of Ghost Stories is interesting, but the game was too long for what it was. The aim of the game is to beat the boss monster, but he only shows up 10 minutes before the end of the game, after more than an hour of fighting monsters which got to be a bit repetetive.

One of my favorite coops and probably one of the most difficult.  I like the scalability with the difficulties, different options of the expansions, and the high challenge and tension throughout the game.

It sometimes feels overwhelming with firefighting, can suffer from "alpha player", and I think its rules for 1-3 players is weaker.  Usually we always play with four taoists and have other players take on extra taoists if we have 1-3 players.

This game is kicking my ass... and I like it!

Edit: maybe a little TOO hard?

Update: This game is hard enough that you can't do any suboptimal moves and still win, and convoluted enough that it's not necessarily all that easy for non-veterans to find the optimal move. This is the perfect recipe for Alpha player syndrome.

Bought this at the peak of the Space Alert induced coop fever. Everybody was buying Pandemic, so I got this instead. 

Played this once with a few rules wrong, but we had a lot of fun. Played a few times more with the correct rules (I hope) and it got better.

I had read some people complaining about the game being too hard, but we didn't have too much trouble to beat the introductory level after 4 or 5 games.

Ghost Stories turned out to be more awesome than I expected. I like it more than Pandemic. This has to be one of the hardest games I've played. Incredibly challenging, but it rewards good play. There are multiple strategies to employ and the game requires you to be flexible as well. It's important to think ahead as much as possible to really succeed. Reacting to what happens gets you killed fast.

Ghost Stories is another wife favorite. Love the White Moon expansion too, though it's not necessary the way On the Brink was for Pandemic.

edit: this wasn't hitting the table so I sold it. It is a good game though. Not sure if selling it was a good idea.

A cooperative game is alwasy welcome. They just tend to be quite hard. This game is especially hard.
Well, it didn't help that different rules were controversial and we played many things wrong. The character abilities are also quite uneven.

Ghost Stories is a thrilling and difficult game. Slowly the town becomes hopelessly overwhelmed by the ghosts and you wish for a rematch. The dice sure look nifty and probably it was us but they never give the result you need!

Oh yeah, and the theme! The ancient chinese mythology is a lot more appealing than any modern stuff would be. It gives the game a slightly noble touch.

This is a four-player game, don't try with less players. You will only be sweating and cursing those ghosts, even more than they curse you...

Bought to have something puzzle like for single play. An alternative to computer games since I already sit in front of the computer plenty enough.

Played 2 trial games just to learn some rules and now my first full game, solo play using all 4 monks. A lot to think about paying like that but then I learned all the rules. Need to read the rules for playing with only one monk.

Tried the solo play with only one monk. SUPERB!!! Much faster, clearer, more engaging in every way. This is how you should play this game if playing solo! First time I've seen a game where the solo rules makes the game better.

A few more solo games and it is now a 10 rating for solo play. I do not know how it holds up for playing with many players. But I bought it for the solo puzzle-like experience anyway so.

Well, the rules are a mess, but that's already a well pointed out fact. The game is kinda nice and flows well once all question marks are straightened out. Dunno though, even though I really like the setting, it all felt very abstract and not very engaging. Maybe it was the combination of no flavor text and cooperative mechanics. I never felt any story, it was just optimizing and hoping for the best (very much how I feel about Knizias Lord of the Rings).

Great game. Simply love it. Mechanism of the game perfectly matches the theme so that you really have the feel of the ghosts attacking the village from every possible direction and the group of brave taoist doing whatever they can to stop them.

Game is very challenging, no to say hard. Although we were lucky in first two games and considered the game of being too easy (we have read the rules correctly), the third and further games showed us we were so wrong...

Big advantage of the game are the four difficulty levels and option for one up to four players. It is quite expensive but there are tones of components you are getting in this price. Cards, miniatures, board tiles, tokens, etc. Everything beautifully ilustrated, especially the cards (each unique, even if some monsters are doubled each has unique illustration, what is rare).

There is a lot of randomness in the game but this is a must in cooperation games to differ each gameplay.

There are also few interesting extensions to boost the game and i'll definately get them all:)

Co-op game similar to Pandemic (cascading threat escalation on every turn, each player having a special power, purely co-op play, no traitor, very simple mechanics, etc.).  But the tension seemed greater, and the obfuscation of optimal strategy seemed more effective; plus, I liked the theme better.

The one game where losing is very rewarding. It is really hard to win this game, and at times it feels like playing chess where the other player can destroy your pieces at will. Lots of back and forth between players deciding which of the impossible threats to go for first. Each of the monks you can pick feels very different. I would heavily recommend to play this game with 4 players always. That last statement is probably my one gripe about the game and it is that it can't acommodate more than 4 and it really feels even harder than it is with less than. Finally, I think this is one of the games that really becomes a completely new animal with the expansion, so I heavily recommend people that get it to plan on investing on the "White Moon" expansion.

RATING: 8.5
Very tough co-op game, which can even be played solo. It is quite scalable to suit your ability (although even the lowest difficulty level isn't exactly easy!).

Kind of feels like a puzzle more than a game, but it's a puzzle that randomly evolves as you play through card draws & die rolls, so this keeps the interest level high. If the game had less hidden information it could be overwhelming by requiring you to calculate too many possibilites for future moves.

During play, there is a constant struggle against the endless stream of ghosts appearing around the board. It seems that there is little room for error, with bad moves or unlucky rolls quickly accumulating until you simply can't hold them back any longer!

I really like the theme and how it has been carried through the components, although I guess it's the sort of game that could have pretty much any theme applied.

WARNING: Rules as printed are awful - even the newer downloadable ones still have various minor errors. The game isn't as complex as they make it appear however, and there is a really good "unofficial" FAQ list which is basically a compilation of official answers from the designer - that clears up pretty much everything.

The box is ridiculously over-sized, but components are good.

Co-op- a term I generally stay away from. I do love the designer Bauza so I decided to give it a chance, it is also highly rated on BGG. I can't say I am a horror fan but the art and colors in this game are wonderful. I did enjoy this game more than Ron, but I would still rather play Robinson Crusoe. I liked that is played quickly and there was some interesting choices to pursue. We died half way through. No hope of winning that one, it seems . I want to try it again.

A fun and brutally difficult game. One of my favorite coops of all time, and fun solo as well.

Unlike many coops and solo games, the punishing nature of this game isn't just random. You HAVE to get good at this game to win, and you CAN get good at it. Sure, bad card draws and dice rolls will kill you, but the game offers up lots of choices and plenty of opportunities to make the wrong one because it looked right. A great game.

This is how you make a co-operative game hard, whilst still retaining the feeling that the decisions you make strongly affect how the game develops. There is an element of randomness in whether you succeed in exorcising ghosts, due to the use of dice, but it usually feels as though it's a calculated risk. Gameplay is fast and the sense of barely keeping the village from being overrun really ramps up the tension whilst offering you countless ways to respond to the crisis at hand. If you're a fan of co-op games, this is a must-play.

Co-op done right. Players have different powers and actually have to co-ordinate themselves to have any chance of winning. Brutally difficult, which keeps me wanting to play over and over. Still playing on Normal difficulty and have yet to make the jump to Nightmare successfully.

Minor complaints: The taoist powers are not well-balanced. Yellow is clearly the strongest and Red clearly the weakest. Some setups are noticeably more difficult than others.

Brutal co-op which actually 'benefits' from having an alpha player as long as they know what they're doing.

It had been a few years since I had last played Ghost Stories, so I was interested to give it another shot. I originally didn't like the game because it had too many 'best moves' which in a co-op game means lots of quarterbacking and the luck element between the dice and the way the hard monsters spawn randomly was too strong for me. Playing it again, I had a similar impression. This isn't a keeper for me.

An enjoyable coop game with a few small things holding it back for me, I would prefer a larger card size for the deck. The other big issue stems from the table space required by having the 4 player boards on each side. I appreciate the design and I feel it is great, but it does not work well for my lack of table space and being a solo player shifting my perspective was annoying. The game is great and difficult, it is just something that could use a better home.

Any game where the set up time is close to equal to playing time better be a darn good game or set up super quickly. This is a needlessly complex set up for the play times and enjoyment levels my group has squeezed from it.  

The difficulty level was beyond the limits of reasonable difficulty and turned every turn into an eye rolling, shoulder slumping, punishment where players felt like every move they made was wrong, or worse was the right move and completely inconsequential.  

A good looking game with a fun sounding concept, but I would not subject my friends to it again. (I've only ever played with 2 live players and I'm willing to believe it hums best in a 4 player game, but I won't risk wasting another night.)

One of many many games of holding off against increasingly difficult odds and trying to play hero.

Good cooperative game. The game material is superb, specially the graphic on the cards and tiles. The basic mechanic of the game is easy but the rules are so badly explained that it makes it hard to understand and to play. The rule book doesn't cover all the aspect of the game leaving some grey area. You will need to refere to the FAQ on BGG or other site to have answer to your questions. The sweet spot of the game is 4 players and the less you are, the less the game seems to be adapted or balanced. In my opinion, the solo game needs to be retested and modified because there is a little something that makes it sort of broken.

Bon jeu coopératif. Le matériel est superbe, spécialement le graphiques des tuiles et cartes. La mécanique du jeu est simple, par contre, les règles sont si mal expliquées quelles rende celle-ci compliquée. Le livre de jeu ne couvre pas tous les points du jeu laissant des zones grises. Vous allez devoir vous référer à la FAQ sur BGG ou d'autres sites pour obtenir des réponses à vos interrogations. Le ''sweet spot'' du jeu est de 4 joueurs et le moins de joueurs il y a, moins le jeu semble adapté et balançé. Selon mon opinion, la variante solo devrait être retestée et modifiée car il y a un petit je ne sais quoi qui semble donner l'impression que cette variante est brisée.

Interesting twist, but insanely hard - quite uncommon among games. If you figure out the right strategy, it's almost always a win, so the replayability is weak. If you cannot figure it out, you will lose all the time and this might be simply frustrating. Feels more like a solo game with some euro twist.

An euro-puzzler disguised as light Ameritrash game. While I do like cooperative games with a theme, I feel like this theme is spread too thin on the game, with the drawings looking like the come from the back of a cereal box and if compared to other theme-driven games (AH and FOD) this looks really generic and bland. Furthermore, it is a puzzler and brainburner and due to the lack of flavour texts, theme implementation and randomness, the theme is soon forgotten and people will concentrate on solving the game. The random setup is nice, although I do not like the colourcoding of monsters which gives the game less flexibility.

One of the best Co-operative games out there. Plus the theme of monks fighting to stop the spread of ancient evil in a chinese village is fantastic. A lot of strategy involved to prevent the return of Wu-lang.

There's a lot to like in this game but it also had some problems for us. The main thing is that there doesn't seem to feel like much progress in the game. You're just barely holding on for a long time, if you survive that you make a boss battle, and then that's it. The narrative of the game just feels off. We added White Moon which did makes things more interesting but ultimately decided we weren't going to play this much. Traded for Dungeons and Dragons: Castle Ravenloft.

If you like coop games (or solitaire games), this is a great one.  I personally like the theme of chinese ghost hunters, and it is very easy to get sucked into the "story".  Unlike a coop game like Arkham Horror or Touch of Evil, though, the mechanics have an abstract feel to them. This is similar to how I feel about the excellent Lord of Rings coop game and it doesn't really get in the way of enjoying the theme. Also like LotR, I think this game has excellent potential to appeal equally to the Eurogamer and Ameritrash fan (I am more of the latter).  After a few games, the game seems to be VERY tough to beat...which should be refreshing to those who don't think a coop game should be too easy to beat.  With multiple levels of difficulty, it is easy to play according to your experience/skill with the game.  The play is fresh and does not overlap with other coop games.  Solitaire potential is excellent, as you can either play solo or controlling all characters.  I love it!

want to play - looks amazing, and an almost-sure thing for Kelly and me.
(after playing once) Yep - this is almost a sure-thing for Kel, except for the way-too-hard difficulty level.
I don't know why the designers nailed the art and theme, and then didn't follow Pandemic's example of having a beginner difficulty level that will lead to success for the players the majority of the time. You can always make something tougher, once the players have played and succeeded once.
Throw in the ridiculously-fiddly and hard-to-remember rules and you've got an almost-guaranteed-to-alienate-newbies game.
The game really almost requires an expert rules moderator, and many groups don't have that (further narrowing this game's audience).
It's too bad - I liked the game, the genre, the art and theme, and many of the mechanics - just not the difficulty level.

A cooperative game that has all players employ mystic talents and monastic training to battle evil spirits, driving them away from the four heroic Monk "player turns", and the nine huts of the village they defend.  Fans of Pandemic will find similar resource management, collaborative strategy, and unique talents for the four roles one may play.

This game is a good co-op game. I'm just not a big fan of co-ops. I only have a small group of co-ops I will play. So take this review with a grain of salt if you like co-ops. This is a very hard co-op with a lot of symbology. I could definitely see why many would like this game, but it just didn't do it for me. I don't like the board set up, or the theme that much. The components are okay and the gameplay isn't spectacular enough to make me play it. Glad I got to play though.

Co-ops require something special to make them into more than a solitaire game with friends. Hanabi is a puzzle where each person is blind to their own pieces, Mage Knight is crazy hard (to the point that a friends presence is actually quite helpful), Battlestar has a saboteur, this had nothing to make it interesting IMHO. It could be played alone with multiple roles and nothing would be lost from a mechanics point of view.

A very tough and punishing co-op game that offers many levels of difficulty for players. Art is very well done but the game leans heavily on icons so expect the first couple games to take awhile as you will keep referring to the rulebook or reference sheet for help on different spirits and village tiles. Game requires strong communication among players and each player board has two sides allowing for a bit of variance in the different player powers.

The game definitely gets tense as you inch closer and closer to victory and sometimes some bad rolls will ruin it for you despite any well made plans and strategies your group has decided on. Plays best with four and it is better for someone to control multiple characters instead of following the special rules in my opinion. Regardless, always an enjoyable experience, win or lose.

Ghost Stories is hard. Some people might say it's too hard.  I generally don't like games that seem impossible.  But there is something interesting about Ghost Stories.  The theme is very intriguing and the components are gorgeous and add a lot to my overall perception of the game play.  I'm not sure if one play is enough to get a full understanding of what I like and don't like, but I'll be back after I play it a few more times.

The components are gorgeous and they feel really good.  They are smooth.  It's seems like a strange thing to remark, but I found the smoothness of the chits very striking.

(Also, the game smells really good.)

For a cooperative game, I found this to be enjoyable.  A little less single-minded than Pandemic, but still requires agreed upon group coordination.  The theme and setting save this game for me, but it's still not something I'd ask to play often.  Still, it was much better than I expected.

Best described as Pandemic meets Knizia's Lord of the Rings--you can very suddenly be overwhelmed and it has fairly abstract mechanics.  It's also a great play-in-under-an-hour coop game that looks nifty and has a unique theme.  It's stronger on individual decision-making versus Pandemic's groupthink tendencies.

I played Ghost Stories several times at BGG Con '08.  Most of the games I played were just so-so, but the last game I played was a incredibly rewarding and fun experience.  One of the problems is that this game has easily one of the worst rulebooks I have ever seen.  Poor translation and a layout of information that appears to have been designed by a sadist make it hard to play this game correctly.  This wasn't helped by the Asmodee rep demoing the game with some wrong rules at the con either.

Now that I've played it several times, and spent a good hour debating every rule in the book and coming to a meeting of the minds, I feel like I have played it correctly and it was an enjoyeable game.  Seriously though, that rulebook sucks hard.

RATING: 8
Component Quality:
Production values are top notch here, with very sturdy village tiles, player boards and minis. I especially love that they went with actual minis for the haunters.

Gameplay:
A very challenging strategy game. Lots of different difficulty levels and ways to set up the village makes for a ton of replay value. There's luck involved, but plenty of player actions can mitigate the luck, making Ghost Stories very much a game of strategy and skill. After many plays, certain strategies have become obvious, but dice can always make any plan more difficult.

Takes a while to get your head around, thanks to the poorly-organised rulebook, but by the same token there's a fair bit to get your teeth in to here. Compared to other co-ops, it feels a lot more tense from almost the first turn. You very rarely get in to a comfort zone like you can with say, Pandemic. The reverse side to that is that the dice can just screw you.

An exercise in self-flagellation. Great theme, artwork, and components. Simple but fun mechanics that make for an incredibly challenging co-op or solitaire game. A seemingly endless flow of ghosts are introduced (with powers that kick in upon introduction, each round, or upon exorcism). The players, "Taoists," move about the village soliciting help from the villagers (gaining Tao tokens, resurrecting fallen comrades, etc.) and rolling dice to exorcise the ghosts in a tactical tug-of-war. Achieved first victory in game #25.

RATING: 9
One of the best pure co-ops for 1-4 players for the time(60-90 min) it takes to play. Works really great solo, probably the best with 4 players. 10+ for the components and artwork, just pure gold. Tough choices all the time, most of the time you can't say for sure which choice is the best. You can't create any fool proof algorithm since the board, special powers and the ghosts are random factors. You have to always react fast or it might be too late. I like the fact that it's so hard to win in Ghost Stories. It makes you play the game over and over again until you win or you reluctantly give up.

Final edit.

Too samey after multiple plays and the alfa gamer problem is just horrible in this game since it is a very hard game.

There is an excellent line towards the end of The Eagle has Landed, in which the German officer says 'The time has come when I no longer control events, events control me'. And that is the problem with this game, you don't really take a pro-active role, you simply firefight.

Ghost Stories is a co-operative game about Power Rangers fighting Rubber Monsters (Okay, its Taoist monks and Ghosts, but frankly its a flimsy theme). Ultimately players must hold off the rubber monsters long enough for the big baddy to arrive and then defeat him. The basic structure will be familiar to all players of co-operative games, each player draws a new ghost and then chooses an action to engage the monsters.

And it works so-so, but Pandemic this isn't. If you liked Pandemic you won't like this. If you didn't like Pandemic you might like this. If you liked Arkham Horror, then you need your head adjusting and I don't care if you like this.

My dislike of Arkham aside that is the problem with this. It feels and plays like Pandemic, but you roll lots of dice at different points to determine if things work and so it feels very random.

I tend not to enjoy most co-ops in general - but this is better than most, and with some pretty nice components. By all accounts, though (and supported by my few plays), this is insanely hard. But too hard is better than too easy. I can't say I found it particularly fun, but this is definitely more interesting than Pandemic or Forbidden Island, and I would like to play it again at some point.

Rocko Says: The best co-op game I have played yet!

I gave this a 9.7, it is so close to a 10... except for a few teeny tiny things.

Ghost Stories is the best co-op game I have played. It is a shorter game than Arkham Horror, which is great, less complicated than Arkham, and still more complicated than most modern board games :)

This game is So much fun! I cannot wait to play it with more people. I expect to play it many, many times over the next few years. 

The compononets and pieces are amazing. Next to Arkham, it is just the most beautiful game we have purchased yet.

What I liked:
1) The game is very well made. High quality, the highest.

2) The mechanics are like most co-op games: constant and worsening damage control. However, based on player decisions and strategies, there are a lot of options on how to deal with the damage. Sometimes the players can even out-pace the board and get ahead, which is rare in co-ops. 

The mechanics are also very interesting and have nuances that set Ghost Stories apart from other co-ops.

3) The artwork and story/theme are just the most groovy ever.

4) The gameplay is fun, unpredictable, and often thrilling. We get so excited playing this. When you lose- you really feel like youve been defeated. When you win- you feel on top of the world!

5) Playable by 2, 3 or 4. Even solo if you want. Lots of options.

6) Ghost Stories almost completely avoids co-op "quater-backing" (where players tell each other what to do- especially experienced players). Each player can make up their own mind and dont Have To spend 20 minutes planning ahead. We have a 'no quaterbacking' house rule for co-op games- it makes them more fun, I promise you.

7) After the first or second game, playtime can be under an hour if you setup fast.

8) lots of expansion options and house rule variants.

My only issues with the game:
1) The rules are difficult to understand at first. Once at least one person knows how to play, they can teach the others pretty quickly. I suggest: someone posted video tutorial on BBG, these taught me the game SUPER FAST! Watch these and then play it like 2 times, then you can show others how to play right away without reading or explaining all the rules- just jump right into it.

2) The 2-player variant is not as much fun as the 4 player game. The use of the extra 2 player boards is janky and not so accessible- I suggest that for 2 players, play a 4 player game instead, with each player controlling 2 character boards. That is a lot more fun!

3) One of the village tiles, the Solider/guard house, is pretty much useless. It slows the game down, and more importantly- if you use it you basically just worsen a bad situation. I suggest a house rule making it into a different kind of tile! Possibilities are endless.

4) The yellow and red players are under-powered if they are the active players in a 2 player game. This game ALMOST needs a house-rule saying that either one or both of the players in a 2-player game MUST play green and/or blue. Yellow and red are good support in a 3 or 4 player game, but Green is your powerhouse and Blue is your get-things-done guy. They are needed in a 2-player game. (experienced players can probably ignore that, or do it as a handicap for expert level play).

These 4 little things aside, this is one of my favorite games ever made, and definitely my favorite co-op so far. Mindy and I have tried co-ops such as Arkham Horror, Red November, and Pandemic. Ghost Stories is better than those games.

RATING: 4
I think this game is best played solo with all 4 players -- one person pretending to be 4.  True multi-player is very prone to sock puppetry, and the printed solo version I find boring -- not having to manage the resource between different characters ruins the game for me.  This game is hard, but it's winnable -- it require very tight coordination and planning; you do not last long if you act like individuals..

However, the scoring system is meaningless for measuring losses.  Usually terrible play gives you a better losing score than when you were a hair away from victory.  Given the brutality and high loss rate, it's frustrating that the scoring doesn't give you a better sense of how you are improving.

Most of my plays are solo, and while I would really want to rate this game higher, for me it only gets about a 7.5 because oh the fact that unless everyone is equally experienced with the strategies to win then this will quickly become an alpha gamer game. That said - really good game

Awesome game, based in some 70´s and 80´s Chinese-EE.UU.,  serie B, action ghost movies! With a remarkable aesthetic, correct choice of colors, beautiful illustrations, and good Graphic Design: something habitual in the games of Antoine Bauza. I enjoy it very much playing it solitaire (mainly on my iPad), but I always prefer to play it on the table (with 2 players, too). In this game is a real challenge to achieve a victory (which is VERY DIFFICULT!!). Far from frustrating, we try again and again... It´s one of our favorite co-ops. I don´t like its dices (it would be great if they were engraved...) but, for the rest, it´s perfect.

06-09-2014. Rated after 3 plays (2 solo). I hate solo games, but I suspect it could be that Ghost Stories is better as a solo-game than with other players. Solo I lost horribly, but playing the normal game with my GF was no tension and we won easily.

GS is a very abstract cooperative game too, which is not a style I typically enjoy, being heavy on theme. It's very elegant though! You play a character that can move just one step per turn on a 3x3 board of Tiles with special actions. The player boards of the different colors, with enemy ghost being played on the player boards depending on their color. You basically try to clean them up as quickly as possible with using dice and tokens. Fun game.. but not so thematic as I like my games. I liked Police Precinct better (another coop I played recently).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Component quality is good and the artwork is outstanding. The rulebook looks equally pretty but is notoriously unclear. Gameplay-wise: This is a co-op game that really piles on the pressure. Yes, it is hard to win. Since the game is your only opponent, it better be a tough one! I highly recommend GS to anyone looking for a seriously challenging and thematic co-op that will have everyone on the edge of their seats throughout the entire game.

RATING: 7
I had had such high hopes for this game, but it was a big flop with me and my wife.  A lot more fiddly than Pandemic, it just wasn't fun.  I think the dice used for exorcising the ghosts hurts the game a lot. Coop games are all of about solving the puzzle together - randomness from the game through uncertain order of cities in Pandemic or monsters in Castle Panic or tiles in Forbidden Island make the game interesting, but randomness from my choosing to take a chance rolling dice or not saps out all the fun, boiling down all my figuring out the puzzle to whether I get a lucky roll or not.  Yeah, you can mitigate the luck factor, and that's where the real strategy is, but that doesn't make for a fun game.  I won't scream if my gaming group wants to play it, but I will always recommend Pandemic over Ghost Stories.

Update: I'm warming to this one.  I still feel like you're really at the mercy of the dice - I feel like you should get some token reward for when you fail to roll the colors you need.  But I see more the potential to ensure that you are always able to kill at least one ghost regardless of what you roll.

A good co-op game.  This one is heavy on luck and luck of the draw, but this helps make it a tense affair.  Sometimes you will have to make a sub-optimal play just to keep one of your players alive.  I do feel like you are encouraged to stay where you are quite a bit which makes not using all the other neat powers in the game a bit frustrating.  Im interested in seeing what expansions will do for this.

So many cooperative games coming out these days. Its hard for a game to compare to Pandemic really, and most co-op games are going to be. Ghost Stories is good, but the randomness that there is hurts the game quite a bit compared to Pandemic where you feel like you have a bit more control. More importantly, the game has really anti-climatic endings.

RATING: 7.25
This is a punishingly difficult co-op game with a puzzly feel to it as players try to determine the best course of action against increasingly more dire odds.  Ghosts are drawn from a deck (random except for the placement of the "boss"), which can allow for variance of difficulty depending on draw order, but it is fairly consistent in being quite challenging but possible to defeat.  There is a possibility that you do draw a seemingly insurmountable sequence of ghosts, or that bad dice rolls ruin your chances (this is the issue which bothers me most, if any), but I find that that sort of crushing defeat is in the spirit of this game, and that the short length and easy setup make this a good "Let's try again!" kind of co-op.

Another cooperative game that is really pretty ridiculously challenging. If you win 25% of the time you play it, that's probably way above the average. The good thing is this game isn't frustratingly difficult. You don't play for hours and hours, only to lose. It's pretty quick. The game really snowballs out of control super fast, and it's great fun to do everything you can to stay above water, until your usual inevitable demise.

Lost pretty badly every time I've played this, and that has turned off some of my friends, who now prefer other games. I'll have to study up on strategies before playing again, otherwise we'll probably lose badly again, making it harder to bring it back to the table for another try. I'm not thrilled about that, as it sort of feels like a combination of "cheating" and "work." I know that people say that you should minimize the degree that you have to depend on the dice to get rid of ghosts, but we haven't been able to make that happen yet, and I can't seem to kick the feeling that the luck factor is too high for my taste.

It's been fun the first couple of times we played it, but I'm dubious as to how long-living the game could be. That said, it seems to go out of its way to increase replayabiltiy - with 8 different 'taoist' players, a huge number of final bosses, and a board which changes every time, as well as different difficulty levels (admittedly which start at 'difficult' and go up...) The expansions almost certainly do even more.

Definately worth a few more plays though - we might actually be able to win.

I've only played it solo so far, where it's not as hard as everyone says. Which means it's also not all that tense. Once you figure out the most powerful tactics it's kinda repetitive and the decisions are obvious.

Have only tried on the easiest difficulty. Good co-op game, but drags just slightly too long for my tastes. Wish that it could play in 45 minutes like Pandemic and stay as tense as Pandemic. Faster with less people, but best with 4.

I like the way that this plays, as a solo game. The player boards being an integral part of play, I find it easier to keep track of what's going on than with say Arkham. 

Not quick to play, but involving. I will get stuck into a game, and when I am at the verge of being beat take a look at the amount of cards still left in the ghost deck, and despair.

Wouldn't personally be inclined to try it multi-player.

The gatekeeper mini-expansion mixes things up a lot, and it seems like a small additional investment (in this case $5 from BGG promo store) can add a deal of variety to the game.

This is a really good coop game. It's not as good as Pandemic of LotR, but it's solid. 

There's definite tension, as many things can and will start exploding onto the scene. One minute your board looks clear, and you think you're doing well,and all of a sudden you're overrun by ghosts. 

I really like the player powers, and both seem really useful and balanced. There's some variability right there. 

I wish the village tiles were a better spread of useful. Most of the time was spent on a couple--other than going to one to kill a baddie. 

I quite liked it, and look forward to more playings.

6.21.11 - After not breaking the game out for over a year, I set it up and played 5 solo sessions this evening. I found that the solo rules with only one monk went significantly quicker than using 4 monks. Game just goes too slow when you're trying to optimize moves for 4 players. Like the game a lot but still can't decide if I want to buy the expansion.

Easily the hardest co-op game that I've ever seen, I love this game.  I was a little off-put by the theme to start with, but a few plays in and I was hooked beyond all measure.

My impression of Ghost Stories is that it's actually pretty boring. Also, it feels like a step backwards in the development of the Cooperative Game genre. It makes no attempt to fix what I believe is the biggest failing of most cooperative games (and perhaps, the entire genre):

It's solitaire. It's not even multiplayer solitaire... one person can just play the game all by themselves. All weekend at BGG.con people were loving the game and talking about how hard it was, but I'm not sure that "hard" should correlate to "chances it's impossible to win, whether you know it or not." Pandemic suffers from that as well - some games you can't possibly win, but you don't know that until after you play. But I had the distinct feeling all throughout my games of Ghost Stories that I would have rather just been playing Pandemic.

To the point: this game is perfect. I love it. It's just outrageously fun.

But it's not for everyone. It's crazy hard. I found it very difficult to learn at first. And very hard to beat. It requires mastery.

You will lose thirty times before you win. But it will keep you on your toes. Pay attention, know the board well, know the different ghosts well and you'll master it. I love that this game scales up and you can mix in the more difficult cards to make it impossible. Unless you're the yellow taoist, of course. Gah, should have put a spoiler warning there.

Cooperative game that works best with 1, 2 or 4 players. Beautiful artwork that complements the theme perfectly. The game seemed a little repetitive and free of tension (tension is a must for co-op!) during the mid-game, but that was probably because we were playing on beginner. The iconography scared me initially, but it was very intuitive. The game flows well and quickly, and the design is refreshing (ghosts entering the board via the player boards to haunt the village in the middle). Still, the playing time seems a tad too long (bring the boss out already!). We didn't discuss our moves too much, yet the game took nearly 90 minutes on beginner. In that sense, the design isn't as tight as Pandemic.

Finally got to play this in 3p and I thought it was pretty excellent.  Normally, I'm not a puzzle-game fan, which this strikes me as.  I like how the village varies, the incarnation(s) vary, etc.  The dummy player with less than 4p is well-implemented and you can play it solo.  Flexibility like that in games is hard to find.  I'm only giving it an 8 because co-ops are not a sweet spot for me as I generally only get to play them with my daughter, but this one seems to do everything right.

It seems that cooperative games have been all of the rage over the past few years.  While the genre is not my favorite, I don't dislike the games in particular (unless they have a traitor element).  I get to play quite a few as one of my friends does really like co-op games.  This seems to have been one of the better ones to have come out in that time period.  There are definitely some interesting things going on that make me want to explore the system further -- a definite necessity in co-op games.  Also, one that I would not object to owning.

A  brilliant "gamer's" game. One of the best solitaire game I own, in terms of its set-up time, play-time, and challenge.  I consistently play under "Normal" difficulty and win 1 out of every 6 games.  Tough.  And you definitely get the sense that your decisions matter.  There is much dice-rolling, but in a good way - you can tip the odds in your favor with good choices, and a bad roll forces you to adapt/adjust strategies on the fly.  Enormous variety in play-style from game-to-game, including how the board is set up, which powers each player has, the order in which ghosts arrive, and which incarnation is in the deck.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff.


Note:  the iOS version is quite good, although there's a lot packed into a tiny screen and you lose a lot of the ambiance and aesthetic character of the board version.

RATING: 1
After a solo play. 

What the hell? I've found the game incredibly boring. Sure it's opaque and has hidden layers and village layout does change things each time, but - it's entirely linear. Each turn it's just more and more of the same. There is no theme here, sure the toys are nice, but could as well be about saving the crops in the field from a heavy rain with a small umbrella (that's how the game feels like at least). 

Being faced with such an uninspired mess, I'll begin to appreciate Pandemic much more. I have to play it first with people though to make a final judgement. 

Rating down to 1.0 because: a ton of plastic layered over soulless uninspired puzzle.

One of my favorite co-op games.
I house ruled that if we never see the incantations, we can't know what they are and they go right back into the deck. Keeps some mystery and surprise.

[1 play] 2 players, with each of running two colors. I enjoyed trying this out and learning the system. Purely tactical, you are just trying to survive the knife fight as the game throws everything at you. I'll need to play again once or twice before I figure out how I feel about replay value and the difficulty of the system. The question with this type of game is how much are you playing the game, and how much is the game playing you. That said, I really enjoyed my first experience.

Players are playing cooperatively and are Ghost Hunters trying to exorcise a variety of spirits, ghosts, monsters etc threatening to engulf a village. Each turn, ghost/s appear and players can move and exorcise a ghost or activate a special action on one of nine village tiles.

The object is to beat enough ghosts to get to the 'boss' ghost. Beat the 'boss' and players win!

Pluses: Gorgeous artwork and components.

Minuses: The ghosts felt too 'samey' and it felt like they purposely tweaked the game to make it hard for the sake of replayability and also because Pandemic was 'easier'. The movement and board felt too small and there weren't really that many 'meaningful' choice to make each turn. Move, exorcise or do a card action. It is more compact and tighter than Pandemic or Shadows.

And I really am not a huge fan of symbols to make a game multilingual. 

However, I do still want to play it if only to say I 'beat' the game. So that's a good sign.

Haven't found this game to be as difficult as most say but the initial random tile setup can sometimes dictate the tone for the game.

I also recommend making cheat sheets that each that clearly  states the rules/procedures for of the ying/yang segments. It's very easy to overlook a legal move which can quickly come back to hurt you.

Ghost Stories is extremely gratifying in its challenge and gorgeous to boot. Right now it is my favorite co-op. 

One downside is the excessive use of symbols. They take some time to get used to. I printed and cut labels for the names and rules of the different village tiles, and that really helped to cut down on that time.

Also, if you're going at it with just two players, I recommend taking two boards each instead of dealing with power tokens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The game is fun if you like cooperatives.  If you don't like them then obviously avoid this game.  It has die rolling and drawing from a deck that both add a luck factor to the game.  It is suspect to a leader taking over the game.  But all of that is basically always synonymous with this type of game.

For everyone else who can enjoy cooperatives, it has some of the best tension out of all these types of games I have played.  On the hardest difficulty you will almost always be barely holding off the board.  You can also reduce the luck factor in the game to a degree depending on how your group decides to play.

Very abstract game: you got nine tiles and ghosts popping up every time. You can choose from several actions, but the one you actually resolve is either obvious or - since this is a coop game - suggested to you. Which is boring.

It also got what most eurogamers misconceive as theme: highly stylized components. However, the game tells absolutely no narrative, it's really just random ghosts popping up. The characters with their different abilities aren't elaborated either.

I don't mind the dice rolling/combat mechanism though, that's pretty neat.

Still, I have no desire to ever play this game again.

Gyönyörűen kivitelezett, szelleműzős, a kooperatív játékok egyik legjobbja. A több nehézségi szint megdobja az újrajátszhatóságot. Egyetlen negatívuma, hogy csak négyen működik jól. A játékosok szerzetesek bőrébe bújva próbálják megmenteni a várost a hihetetlen mennyiségben felbukkanó szellemektől, akik különböző képességekkel szinte reménytelen küzdelemre késztetik a játékosokat. Nagyon fontos az együtt gondolkodás, különben még kezdő fokozaton sincs sok esélye a játékosoknak a játék ellen. Aki kooperatív játék kedvelő annak nem hiányozhat a polcáról ez a játék.

Man is this game difficult. Over time, I've come to appreciate Ghost Stories more and more. Initially, the challenge was exciting, but the game was just so brutal.

It's one of my favorite cooperative games and the artwork and production are just fantastic.

YATZEE! I killed a ghost! 

I know that I am near alone in saying this, but this game is really boring.  There are a number of fun options that the system offers, but most of the time you are too busy standing in one place rolling dice to do anything fun.

While the art is fantastic, I feel like there really isn't much personality to any of the monsters.  Coffin Breakers again?  Mostly I just felt like we were on a little island where we were trying to hold back the tide as it dragged away the sand beneath our feet. 

I like games that offer me options, but with this as things get worse all the options are taken away.  Eventually you find yourself just standing in a corner rolling the dice and checking the results.

Very difficult cooperative game about Chinese ghostbusters.  Ghost Stories was my first cooperative game and my introduction into the hobby, and I recall getting absolutely destroyed several times on the easiest setting.  The times that I have won this game have always been extremely close, and things can really go from "doing well" to "royally boned" within a few turns.  It's brutish and painful, but overall a fun experience.

What a great and challenging game!

We've only played once so far, and on it's easiest setting, but the game handed us our butts! No one was upset though--we just went on to talk about what we might want to do differently next time. The rules seem a bit confusing at first, but you get the hang of them quickly as you play.

With the large number of games in my collection that have still not hit the table yet, it might be a while before we play this again, but I am looking forward to more plays!

It was the sheer diffculty and the desire to want to win that drove my brothers and I to come back time and again till we finally defeated it. Even after we still continue to have our fair share of losses.

An absolute winner. I don't even know how mr Bauza could have designed such a well balanced game, and yet included such variety. I mean, you have all the great mechanics of the game and high tension throughout, but the 4 player characters all have different powers that all work together, and none of them supercede the others. Thats a feat right there, but then you can also choose from 2 different powers for each monk! Thats pretty awesome. And the game is the definition of tense, with tough decisions, and working together, and cool creatures, and fantastic art, and high-five wins, etc etc. In my opinion, Ghost Stories is a masterwork of design and balance. 

Oh, and it's hella fun too, BTW...

A great co-op game, very original and engaging. Requires planning and also reacting on what comes. It's a great mix of stuff. The only downside is the red player, who feels... not useless, but seriously hindered compared to other characters in the group. It's just a figure that is sometimes usefull. Really just sometimes. Most of the time it's just a figure that would play the same with no ability at all. But despite that I love the game and I love how the difficulty keeps you engaged even after so many plays. Playing mostly on nightmare now.

This game is alright and extremely challenging but it is also overly convoluted.  The rules seem much more complex and counter-intuitive than they need to be and you never get to do very much on your turn that it is hard to stay interested.

I also can't stand the oversaturated look of the game.

A gem of a coop game that just has so many qualities: it forces you to think ahead, makes you to use both strategy and tactic, has a perfect learning curve and high replayability, and just enough luck mechanics to randomize and keep tension high without making the games chaotic. The difficulty level is ideal: average gamer groups will take a couple of losses on the first level before getting the basic strategies to get things done and progress to the next levels. 

I can't see anything wrong about the game, and I would urge any gamer to pick this one up.

This game is one of the best coop out there. It's hard, which is great for a coop, even at the easy level. Decisions require careful assessment of the situation and optimization. The game grows in tension until the very end. A fantastic game overall.

An interesting cooperative game. The game is generally hard - as you might have seen from some reviews. While I don't have much to say about it, the game production overall is very high. The pieces look great and as well as the overall design of the boards and cards.

In terms of game play, I found the concept interesting at first but after learning to play a game without accidentally breaking any rules, the game does not seem that interesting. You are pretty much killing the same enemies over and over until you kill the bosses. While I admit most other board games do the exact same thing, it does seem very annoying waiting for the reincarnations to "pop up".

The best part of the game? I would say the dice (I have a thing for good looking dice) as well as the rush to quickly kill all of the enemies off your board as they begin to accumulate across the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's really as tough to win as people claim, me thinks, and that is both intriguing and frustrating. In this co-op the group tries to live long enough until the big bad(s) come out to fight with and ultimately win. Everyone gets one move, one action and their special ability to use and I think we could need more actions to have a decent chance but maybe I am just pampered by other games. The theme works okay, I think I would have liked to see ghosts moving around more or something ghostly  like that, it has really nice art work though. So, it is not my favorite co-op (which of course could change some day) since I don't quite get the "ooh, need to try that again"-feeling from it but am willing to play occasionally. But, and this has to be said again, it is absolutely gorgeously looking.
On our 2nd game things went a lot smoother, a good die roll goes long ways in this game.

Awesomely difficult co-op which feels like a kkung-fu movie, fighting baddies on all sides for no apparent reason.  Love the theme, the art, and the set-up.  Game play may become samey, I suppose, but I haven't played it enough for that to happen yet.

I just don't find it that fun.  I think even though it says 1-4 players, often one or two "players" will have to do the same thing every turn just to stave off losing.  That's no fun for them.  I think it was tested with one player playing all 4 colors.

Played it a few times. 

It makes you panic a few times when you feel overwhelmed with ghosts. Some games were fun. 

Other games made you feel that it was more like a puzzle then a game. Where you distanced yourself from your monk 
and together you were discussing the best moves to make together. Took a little the fun out of the game.

Ghost Stories seems to be a love it or hate it game - I'm one of those who loves it. The artwork is superb, and the components, particularly the Buddha figures, are outstanding, so a very big thumbs up for the physical quality.

The Introductory level was challenging for the first few games, but once I'd beaten that I could beat the Standard level as well. Ten games in I was playing at Nightmare level, and moved on to Hell level after twenty or so.

I played my first games solo so I would be able to teach it to others, and was rapidly addicted. In fact, I actually prefer solo play at this point. How best to exploit the power tokens is an interesting decision which is lost in a four player game, and I'm happy pursuing my own strategy without having to explain or negotiate.

The rules are not nearly as bad as some people claim, and help is readily available in the Rules Forum. When looking for specific rulings, I recommend a forum search with folder set to "Rules" and user set to "toinito" (the designer).

This is a co-op survival horror game that will leave you bleeding and screaming for mercy, which is, of course, why I love it!

I'm currently in the middle of completing a '100 Play' challenge on this game, and I'll probably be at it for a while yet.  Most of my plays have been solo, but the solo rules present a very interesting challenge.  They're very different from multi-player coop, but still very tough!

If you have any love for either co-ops or the kung-fu/horror mashup theme, getting this game is a no-brainer!

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Okay game after trying it out.  Seems like there is just a flood of cooperative games out there lately.  I won't say I disliked this game but at the same time not going to be a top favorite either.  The theme is kind of medium to me.  The artwork, and overall board and pieces I thought were very good, very sharp looking game.  It was fun to learn, but really at some point battling the ghost over and over was starting to get a little bit tedious.  I just don't get the feel that I would enjoy playing this one often.  It was fun working as a team and trying to figure out the best actions each turn.  I would play it again, but likely not recommend it or suggest it.

RATING: 6.5
[Repos 2008 edition] {Horror; co-operative, dice-rolling, variable-player-power; scalable}  Ghost Stories is a nicely produce games.  The plastic figures and the illustration of cards and tokens are attractive.  It is worth the price with this production quality.

Ghost Stories is not a ground-breaking co-operative games - players have to turn over cards for the 'devil' and to solve some mini-puzzles.  Nonetheless, it works well as a co-op game.  Players really need to work, play and communicate together in order to win.

Ghost Stories has several minuses.  Firstly, it is repetitive because each move is similar.  It is also anti-climax.  There is little excitement when the Wu-Feng incarnation appears and it is usually easy to kill the incarnation at the initiation game once it appears.  The game just ends so suddenly (I have similar feeling with Pandemic).  I think only the normal / nightmare will bring enough challenges for experienced players.  And, the cards are too random - some ghosts are just much more powerful / scary than others.  I also found that the game is not balanced with the arrangement of the 9 village tiles; some arrangements are more beneficial for the players.  The rulebook is a messy! I think they should really rewrite the whole thing and post a revised copy at their web site.  Finally, the theme, Chinese ghost stories, is novel but the system doesn't tie with the theme seamlessly.

There is certainly large dose of luck in Ghost Stories but I am not annoyed.  The luck really makes this game fun for me. 

I still can't make up my mind whether to purchase a copy or not.  It's not highly fun for me but the theme and components are attractive enough.  So far, after trying it, I am not as eager to buy it as before.  Maybe, I will get a copy when I have a larger house.

RATING: 10
I'd been slavering over Ghost Stories since reading the hype about it from Essen, and I bought it on an impulse when on a vacation in Seattle. Reading over the rules later in the hotel room, I started to feel a bit trepidatious; they were a bit confusingly written with some questionable translation, and overall the concept of the game seemed a bit too repetitive and simple to be fun. I know that a simple concept doesn't necessarily mean that a co-op game can't kick your butt (see Pandemic), but, anyway, I was starting to worry that I'd blown $50 and valuable suitcase space (we never check luggage, so this is always at a premium on vacation) on an overhyped release with nice production values. After about half of a game that I abandoned, I was even more worried, but still determined to give the game a fair shake.

Oh wow, am I glad I did. When played with four people, this is an unmerciful, immersive, and downright fantastic co-op. It can suffer from the "loudest player" problem that a lot of open-info co-ops do, but, honestly, I find that to be largely unavoidable in many co-ops. It's somewhat mitigated by the fact that, usually, EVERYTHING is going wrong, and so there's often several answers for a given turn, none of which are particularly clearly correct. Ghost Stories is now one of my favorite co-operative games, often inspiring "just one more try" when we've gotten our butts handed to us, which is high praise for a game that tends to run about 45-60 minutes (usually once in a row is enough for an hour-length game for my group and me).

It has exceeded my expectations. I love the way the game develops the tension as each ghost played brings something different to handle, and the complex interactions of the player powers and the village powers. I am usually wary of games with dice in, because of the potential for extreme turn-arounds based purely on chance, but in this game their effect is really well balanced. They add tension and excitement like dice should do, but don't dominate the game play. They are nicely balanced with the powers and the tao tokens. 

Also as a coop or solo game you can just write off a loss due to a run of bad throws as the luck of the dice, you don't have an opponent to worry about offending (by saying they were just lucky to win). 90 minutes is not too heavy an investment to then lose on bad luck, especially as you've had so much fun on the way.

The artwork is great, and the feel is great. I cannot wait for my next game.

My first modern board game. Rules explanation can get a bit long, but once you get playing ...

The theme feels fun and fantastic. It's just silly enough to allow us to step back when the intensity rises too high and laugh at how screwed we are. And boy does the intensity rise quickly. This game strikes early and doesn't hold back. The first time the Ghosts line up into an impossibly perfect stream of deadly combos you will think it's a fluke. The next several times it happens you will come to the realization that Wu Feng is sentient, he is trapped in your board game, and he wants to destroy you.

Art and components are top quality. The rules are a bit muddy at points but the wonderful iconography allows me to forgive this.

The game is very difficult. But it never really feels like any one player's fault so the frequency at which we lose never becomes abrasive. Every turn becomes a puzzle, a tactical nightmare at the mercy of dice that will always be stacked against you and ghosts that should have been dead three turns ago laughing over the ruins of the innocent village you are failing miserably to defend. And I wouldn't have it any other way.

You will loose.  A lot.  A LOT!  And really that's the one thing that stops this from being a great game.  This is one co-op where you don't have any downtime, you are always in a  panic, always!  And that's fun.You will find ludacris and hilarious ways to keep, just barely being alive, you will laugh and remember fondly the times you played the game.  If there was one game that makes being utterly screwed so very fun it is this game.  The goal is not really to win, it is to see how long you can survive before eventually succumbing.  And if you can wrap your mind around that, you're sure to have some fun.

Played many games on the Ipad, with no wins. 

Played twice with the boardgame. One was a crushing defeat. The other was an easy victory. Seems we were quite lucky on the order of the draw deck.

But the games offers tough decisions. You will need to do 3 or 4 things on your turn, but can only do one. Choosing where to place the ghosts requires some thinking.

Do you take a chance and try to exorcise the ghost only with the dice, or do you use tokens? Maybe the yellow player could help with that if he has the right power. Do you go for the though ghost that makes you roll the curse dice every turn, or the weak ghost that will haunt a tile in two turns?

Lots to think about, and requires a lot of teamwork between the monks to be successful. The different powers will mostly mean that each players will have a different role in the game, but sometimes you will be in the wrong place at the wrong time and you will have to take matters into your own hands.

The game provides lots of tension most of the time, barely holding the ghosts back and watching your qi slowly trickling away while you wait for Wu Fend to appear.

The game can offer brutal reversal. You'll have a few easy turns, controling the ghosts with no problems, then you'll get flooded with hard to kill nasty ghosts and monks will drop like flies. 

The tension in the game is dependant on the order in which the ghosts appears, but it is quite uncommon to have an easy game with no tension. Only happened to me once in 25 games.

Just a little too dry for me. As with all fully co-op games, tends to be run by the most experienced player/alpha (fe)male.

As of right now, I'm very much enjoying this game and how badly it is beating the crap out of Me and my group.  I think over time, this could suffer as we get better and consistently can beat it.  Luckily it has many difficulty levels.

It can suffer from one person leading the group.  However, it still remains fun, and I enforce the fact that it is each individual players decision when it is there turn what happens, same as Pandemic.  That way we don't have the problem as much as we could, but it also might be why we keep losing.

Whereas long ago Shadows Over Camelot would have been my coop game of choice it is being replaced by such games as this one and Pandemic.  There is significant challenge even on the basic level right now - and the artwork and bits sure enhance the gameplay.

Not sure how I think on the expansion but I am sure I prefer Pandemic to this one.  Although this is a good game it's fiddliness and difficulty keep it from breaking into the high ground.

Not my favorite cooperative. Some good ideas, different setup & position of the villages power should give you enough replayability, as well as the different end bosses.

[i]Word of warning: We have not taken to cooperative gaming.[/i]

I LOVE the theme. Players team up to fight ghost, ghouls and other assorted bad boys. They try to stay ahead of the curve, but are often fighting a losing battle against the constant flow of evil encroaching on the town.

The game oozes theme and you feel a sense of accomplishment when you ultimately defeat the BIG baddie at the end. It is no mean feat and increasing the difficulty will keep you on your toes.

In your fight against evil you can call upon your very own special abilities, as well as those of the many inhabitants of the town, who are all willing to help you - after all, it is their small town in danger of being overrun.

The game will play out differently each time as the game board is set up using the tiles available, but mixed together. Sometimes you will have a great combo next to each other, sometimes they will be across town. It is also of importance in what order evil comes at you. You can get lucky and have a few easy pickings, helping you set up for the hard hitters, or you can be overwhelmed from the start.

It involves dice, so there is a random element here too, but nothing that should deter anyone from playing. This aspect can be mitigated to an extent by Tao tokens.

I enjoy the theme immensely, my wife less so. The game is fun and tense at the same time. It is a game that plays equally well solo as 2 player. The reason for this is perhaps that I tend to take charge, though not always with the proper course of action.

Our objections are very few, but they are significant. As I began stating, we have not really taken to the whole cooperative gaming aspect. It is fun for a while, but it just doesn't hold the lasting appeal for us - even with a killer theme.

You get lucky breaks from time to time, but most of the time you feel you are running around putting out fires. I think we prefer a more slow paced game. This game is meant to be played with monsters coming at you from all sides...

My rating reflects these "grievances". At the end of the day I would be more than happy to play a game of [gameid=37046] but I see no need to own it, nor seek it out.

RATING: 9
So far, this is getting a solid 8...but as I've only played it one player so far, I don't feel I can yet give it anything higher until I have experienced a multi-player game.  It is difficult, no argument there, but somehow, you find yourself drawn to it.  You want to play it.  Even when surrounded by terrifying ghosts with no way out for you (or the village) you just love the experience.  (Not to mention the beautiful art...wow!)
Update: Played it two player, still really enjoyed it, but I want to try with three.  I upped the rating because of how solid it is.

RATING: 7
Ghost Stories is heralded as one of the toughest cooperative games you can buy.  Playing up to 4 players, you take on the roles of nameless defenders of a village being overrun by denizens of the undead.  Using your own skills and the skills of the villagers in town, in coordination with the other players, is key to landing a victory in this game.   

The art in this game is excellent.  The ghosts are all creatively designed, and the primary + green colors all integrate with a black backdrop that is wonderful to look at. 

This game after the first turn always feels down to the wire.  There will be a lot of group effort to determine the most efficient play possible.  It is painful to see something go wrong because the ghosts can snowball out of control in a hurry, leaving you with dead monks and a haunted village.

I personally love the difficulty in this game, but it is a HARD game to introduce new players to correctly.  Letting other people experience the game for the first time without commanding the most efficient course of action from them (aka being an alpha gamer) is hard to balance without coming off as disingenuous.  If you can play this with people who have played about as often as you, then you are in for a treat.  

So why is this is a 7?  Well, simply put, I feel I have solved this game, so the replay-ability has run its course for me.  I love introducing new people to this game, but I don't like dominating the game decisions OR holding back and watching mistakes get made.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game as a fun, intensely challenging, coordinative experience.  As long as I'm not playing ;)

28-Nov-08: Co-op game that is akin to Pandemic in the sense that players have to work together efficiently otherwise be overwhelmed by bad stuff. I rate it slightly higher because it's got a fabulously original theme, and I love the artwork. Ultimately though, it devolves into a 'Save the player on your left' game as they'd get hit with either a Curse or a -1 Qi (HP) if they start their turn with 3 Ghosts on their player board.

As with most games, the more you play the faster it goes.  I still have to look at the rule book for the symbols and the order of operations.  The Yellow Taoist always dies with me playing solo because I forget to use his special ability of collecting Tao tokens :( I've only played solo, and always lost.  So far, none of the games have been played "cleanly" (i.e. I always forget to do something that is in my advantage).  It is, none the less, fun.

Ghost Stories is a wonderful co-op game that drips with theme.  The artwork is beautiful.  The game is absolutely evilly brutal.  Watch out for this one, it's hard, even with only a single Incarnation of Wu-Feng to face - players must take advantage of every action they can, while fighting a set of dice that seem to be against them at every roll.

At first, I really liked this game. The high difficulty and interesting theme caught my attention. I was also fresh off of Pandemic, which was very fun. But the more I played Ghost Stories, the less I liked it. So much comes down to the random order of the ghost cards, and of the dice rolls. You can use the different board elements to stem the tide, but most of the time you can see your defeat coming many turns out. Too much luck and too little chance of winning make this an incredibly frustrating experience (in a bad way).

UPDATE: I employed the help of a Ghost Stories expert to show me the way. And we won. Hurray! I did learn that I had misinterpreted one rule -- a minor difference. For now, however, I am only raising my rating from a 2 to a 3. I've learned that I like the luck in cooperative games to define the challenge (e.g., card flipping in Pandemic), and not whether I can beat the challenge (e.g., rolling dice in Ghost Stories). I *am* happy to know that the game can in fact be won.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ghost Stories can be a brutal cooperative game, where monsters come at you with alarming regularity.  Granted, you have to get them on the board in order to reach the main baddie, so it's not all bad when they come out fast and furious.  Nevertheless, time seems to be in short supply since players must choose between collecting good stuff OR fighting.  So while you load up on energy, the monsters are by definition getting out of control.  Tough game!

I was really excited about this game and I think it does a lot of things well.  The theme is unique and I love how they set up the village.  Unfortunately, it is just too hard and there aren't many simple ways to make it easier.  It's frustrating to lose when you are only half of the way to the boss and it's unsatisfying to win when you only play with half the deck.  I'm sure I could develop some winning strategies after 5 or 10 plays, but all of my other gaming friends have been soured by constant crushing defeats and there are just too many other good games out there.

There is no room for wasted moves in this fast paced co-op. The invading ghosts won't hold up, and every turn, every action needs to not only contain their numbers but also forward plan for more dangerous threats. Cleaning up messes won't be enough. I thoroughly enjoy the difficulty of this game. It works well as a solo game (as it is heavily prone to alpha gaming) and I prefer to play as all four players rather than the suggested solo mode. Winning will feel so sweet, as you will need to work hard - there is some luck involved, but a lot of strategy is needed; knowing when to respond to threats and when to let them go in order to plan ahead. The theme works well with the fast-paced action and the abilities of the characters are interesting and quite variable. There is not much variation however in the miniatures, but still, the game still looks quite stunning.

Probably my favorite co-op after Pandemic, because I'm masochist. I've only experienced one win, and that was playing with other people who knew what they were doing. This one is HARD. Even on the beginner level. It takes a bit getting used to, as well, to remember all of the powers and iconography. However, the game is very immersive once you give it a chance, and tons of fun. Make sure you learn this from someone else or use a BBG rules book because the one that comes with the game is terrible. The worst I've ever seen, actually. The cards are a little rough, too, so you might sleeve them if that's your thing. I also had an issue with sticky dice, but Asmodee replaced them without much fanfare. It's a great game, though, with a great theme. I highly recommend it.

RATING: 8
A terrific cooperative game that does what so many others fail to do ... it pressures players to play well or fail and, more importantly, gives players the opportunity to make clever moves. The theme is engaging and a hard-fought win very satisfying. Ranks with Pandemic and Battlestar Galactica in the upper echelons of cooperative games. With the advent of this new breed of cooperative, I can't picture myself playing Shadowns Over Camelot or Lord of the Rings much in the future.

The rules are not very easy to understand (but they seem to be), and it is annoying to have three different places in which to look up information. Still - the feeling of despair is unmatched, and that is a good sign.

If you think it is easy it probably depends on either luck or that you have a rule wrong somewhere. It has about the worst written rules I have ever encountered.

It still has the ability to draw me in though. All in all I will almost never turn down a game.

Ghost Stories is a grand cooperative that is sabotaged by its instruction manual.  The game is drenched in theme and its design prevents one player from taking over the preceedings. It's a little dicey, with a double-dose of luck per turn (card draws AND dice rolls). But Ghost Stories is hard to get to the table because the instructions are a mess, inspiring a 10+ page FAQ that is longer than the rules themselves.

I love co-op games in which the challenge steadily escalates, with the occasional sudden unexpected turn for the worse.  Ghost Stories fits that bill.  The biggest negative after an initial play is that the iconography is fairly overwhelming, which can make it difficult to learn.  The game might also be a bit of a whack-a-mole, but I'll need to play it more to see if that's the case.

Really awesome co-op. Has a whole different feel from your Pandemic/Forbidden games, as this one almost feels more like a tower defense game (enemies surround your village and you have to destroy them before too many build up).

Update: Have played some more with the White Moon expansion and a homemade version of the guard tower tile, and that seems to be the way to go. White Moon and the Guardtower make the game a little easier, but considering it was almost impossible to begin with, that's a good thing. Now the game is still difficult but almost winnable.

This is become my favorite co-op game. I put Space Alert as a close second. I would probably like SA more, but it's hard to get four other players to play it consistently and reach its full fun potential. That said, I can play GS solo, and it's much easier to sell it to the table. I now own all the expansions and most of the promos cards. I a bit of a GS fanboy at this point. I even designed my own Wu Feng card here: [url]http://boardgamegeek.com/article/9504021[/url]

One of the most unique and difficult but brilliant co op games out there. Much prefer this to Pandemic. It's also great solo. Still far from mastering it. I can see this game being ruined by the alpha gamer as it is hard just to let people make mistakes. But once you get a team of people who had a couple of games under their belt and that like the clever clever puzzle this game throws at you then it gives you one hell of a collective gaming experience.

Lost the first four games (3 x 2 player, 1 x solitaire) on Initiate level before winning the fifth with three players on the last roll of the dice. The game is extremely challenging, especially for lower numbers of players. Most of my games will be two player, so for future games I think we'll play with two Taoists each. Initial rating of 7.

10 plays. 3 wins; 7 losses. More of a puzzle than a game and not a great deal of fun. Rating dropped to 5.

Rating based on solo version on iPad, which I have been playing non-stop. I am pretty sure if I tried to play this with a new player at this point I would just tell them everything to do, which is kind of the eternal problem with cooperative games. I do like it, but it's very random and potentially frustrating.

Challenging(!) cooperative game with multiple paths to failure (victory, it turns out, is rather elusive).  Variable locations in the village and the different order of the ghosts' appearance every game make each play feel different so far.  With our track record (one victory with a favorable rule interpretation in four tries), just the desire for a better performance keeps us coming back for more punishment.

The components are really nice, with fantastic artwork and nifty miniatures.  I only wish the ninjas (oops, taoists) were a little less garish.  If only I had painting skills.

A fun thematic co-op...probably the first modern (2000+) co-op I've played. I'm not sure if it was the newness of the co-op idea or the game itself but it was very difficult.  I'd like to play it again and see if I do any better.

One of the better co-op games that I've played. Can be punishingly difficult even at easier game modes and requires a thoughtful group of players. Works pretty well at all player counts. Main gripe would be that random board set-ups can lead to very unfavorable conditions for the players and can make a bigger difference than some of the difficulty settings from the rule book. That, and the rule book is of fairly poor quality.

First Impression:

A tough cooperative game, with elegant mechanics and a superb pace.

The game manages to be tough without having the players feel weak or helpless and almost without luck. The pace of the game is also great, as the players easily manage the situation at the early game, and then ever so gradually become overwhelmed. The gameplay is very easy yet it forces some very tough decisions, and cooperation between the monks is essential for victory. Finally the game is pretty and the theme caries through very very well.

As with all classic cooperative games, Ghost Stories also potentially suffers from the Alpha Player syndrome, even if the tough decisions create many opportunities for disagreements. The village tiles are not of equal strength, and we found ourselves prefering the same old most of the time, even though some are extremelly important if all hell breaks lose.

Overall this is very well polished game, and as a fan of cooperative games I enjoy it very much.

Another Co-op that tends to make me feel like it's pretty much the same thing over and over. Still not bad obviously with me giving it a 7 rating it's got some merit. I like the variable positioning of the tiles in the center of the board as that can reallyi change the game. Need to get a few more plays in before I call this one for sure...the rating will most likely change.

Ghost Stories is the best cooperative game I've ever played and it's a very crowded field these days, what with the recent release of Pandemic, Red November, Space Alert, and the semi-cooperative Battlestar Galactica, all being added to the previous bulwarks of the genre Lord of the Rings and Shadows over Camelot. Cooperative games have come a long way in recent years as more of them are published and designers experiment with a wider variety of elements in creating their cooperative designs. I'm sure cooperative games still have a long way to go in their development with many more innovations and twists, but for the time being, I am more than satisfied with Ghost Stories. I've played it 23 times already since its release last October and have enjoyed every play, even those in which my fellow Taoist priests and I have been mercilessly crushed by Wu-Feng and his minions. Ghost Stories is renowned for its difficulty, which has been off-putting to some, but as someone who prizes the challenge of Survival Games such as Antiquity, Age of Steam, and La Citta, the extreme difficulty of Ghost Stories is one of its merits, not one of its flaws. I appreciate the challenging nature of Ghost Stories and other Survival Games because it rewards repeated plays. It rewards revisiting the game time and again despite repeated failure in order to learn where you went wrong and what you can improve upon next time. You might go bankrupt in Age of Steam or drown in pollution and graves in Antiquity, but if you keep at it, you'll learn to conquer those obstacles. The same goes for Ghost Stories where you'll eventually find yourself breezing through the game after many failed attempts. You might think this would mean you would never want to play the game again, but fortunately the game has 4 difficulty settings, ranging from Initiation, to Normal, Nightamre, and finally Hell. It's amusing to see people's reaction when you tell them after they've lost horribly that they were playing on the Initiation difficulty level. Just as with Pandemic, the inclusion of a variety of difficulty levels is a very wise move in any cooperative game since it allows players to adjust the challenge based on the experience of the players.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention another significant advantage of Ghost Stories, which is the way it wonderfully scales to accomodate 1 to 4 players. All of the player counts work remarkably well, and as someone who's picky about that sort of thing, I greatly appreciate a rare gem like Ghost Stories that can work with many different size groups. I should also mention the Guardhouse mini-expansion for Ghost Stories, which I think adds a nice element of variety to the experience. Unlike most mini-expansions, which either add nothing meaningful to the game (e.g., Ticket to Ride Mystery Train or Settlers of Catan Fisherman) or actively harm the game (e.g., Saint Petersburg Banquet), the Guardhouse mini-expansion for Ghost Stories is the first of its kind that I've found to actually improve the game. It adds a tenth village tile to the game, which increases the variety of the board layout as you remove a random village tile from each game, and also adds five new cards to the deck of ghost cards (similarly with five random cards removed). Most importantly, the new tile and cards fit seamlessly into the mechanics and theme of the game. This gives me great hope for the upcoming White Moon full expansion for the game, previously announced on Boardgame News.

Ghost Stories is my favorite game of 2008 (http://games.fooville.net/#Award2008) for all of the reasons explained above but most importantly because of the mood and feeling of the game, which are difficult to put into words. Ghost Stories is a game in which the players represent Taoist priests defending a village from invading ghosts. The ghosts are attacking from all sides. The village and the players are surrounded. You feel this when you're playing. You feel trapped and surrounded. You feel like you're running from place to place putting out fires and addressing the most urgent emergency. The assault of ghosts is relentless and you feel the relentless attack as the ghosts keep coming, filling in the places vacated by the previous ghost that you just defeated. It reminds me of the scene in Song of Ice and Fire where the Night's Watch is surrounded and attacked on the Fist of First Men. The reference may not mean anything to many of you (in which case I recommend reading George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series), but in that case the game may remind you of a scene in a different movie or book where the characters were surrounded and outnumbered by a relentless foe. This game is an uphill battle. You're faced with a Sisyphean challenge. It's incredibly difficult, but that makes victory all the sweeter.

A hard and clever cooperativa game. One play usually takes about 45 minutes, which is a great length for repeated plays (and you probably will want to do that).

My first coop game. Maybe my last, but not because I dislike this particular game. I'm just mostly interested in 3+ player games.

Anyway, I had fun. My monks all got killed, but I lasted surprisingly long from the moment I realized I was in trouble. Difficult decisions regarding which fires to put out first.

So, the game seems quite difficult, but I wondered if it would be "too" difficult. It occurs to me now that it might not even matter if the game was so hard that it could never be won, because you could at least try to top your best attempt.

I also worried about people saying this game is abstract. I didn't like the sound of that but was also unsure what would be bad about it. As it turns out I didn't think the game was too abstract: There are enough things that make thematic sense that a sensible narrative can form in my mind as I'm playing. And that must be it: Purely abstract games don't easily tell a relatable story.

...Played a bit with the family (it is a real hit) recently and won a couple of times. Winning can be pretty anticlimactic. Losing too, though. I felt the abstract nature of it more when trying to explain the game to the 3-year-old who wanted to be part of it. There's no good way to explain what the player boards and colors represent. A green ghost threatens the green monk and attacks from his specific cardinal direction... What's it mean? So you can't use the theme to help answer rules questions, magnifying the unhelpfulness of the rules booklet.

It definitely took a few plays to make sure I was following the rules correctly...  I was playing solo and the rules for this variant are a little vague in the book.   Once I got through that, it was very enjoyable- challenging, but not impossible!  Haven't played it with a group yet, but I would recommend this as a solo game for sure!

A brutal co-op game with solid mechanics. The theme is great and the ghosts that attack really feel menacing and dangerous. The only problem is that the game is artificially difficult sometimes.

People rave about this game. It's OK... In my opinion it's not great. I just get a bit bored of it. As a co-op game it can degenerate into a following the leader event. One person making all the decisions... I like the desperation... But it doesn't make me love the game.

I have the following expansions for this one:

Steven Qi-Gal
The Guardhouse
The Infernal Die

Created for gamers who were teethed on playing really dumb AI's that had to cheat and be ridiculously overbearing to create a feeling of 'tension.' I don't buy the coop moniker to excuse the lack of human agency as the gaming prime movers. This one has a pretty-faced metronome mechanic to simulate constraint.

A group puzzle to solve against a clock, over & over & over.

The lovely theming can't get this one over the numbing, repetitive gamepay.

Played this a few times to learn to play it, then played a couple times so far.  It is actually a very simple to learn game.  It is a little repetitive, but the ghosts coming at you from all directions and you having to just survive is kinda cool.  It is a rush to get as many ghost off the board as you can to hold out until the boss ghost comes into play.  I don't know how much replay it has, but so far it is a great game to pull out if you don't want too long of a game, but yet a game that is more in depth than a lot of other games.  UPDATE.  This game gets a bit better with more plays.  This is a great game.  However, I have been playing it with the white moon expansion and that adds some really cool stuff.

Ghost Stories is my preferred cooperative game. Pandemic is also right up there. Having a theme and rules that most people can handle makes it easy to play it with anyone. Ghost Stories requires more from the players and does not feel as natural. As much as  I love the artwork and idea, it feels far more like an abstract puzzle than Pandemic does. Still, I prefer it, probably because of the theme, the art and  the feeling that you really are up against it.

Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell – Wu-Feng – and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.

For somewhat unknown reasons, my wife likes this more than I do (we play 2-player, each controlling 2 Taoists).  

I can say that I feel games are too similar from one to the next, despite the variation brought in by 2 different special abilities for each Taoist, randomization of when ghosts come in, and the variety of boss cards.  

I do enjoy the game but.. I just don't feel like I "need" to play it.  It's challenging, which I enjoy,  but it feels a little too programmed to me.  In other words, I feel like the 'best' action is always the 'best' action, and so once you've identified which action you can take, it doesn't change much.

With all of this said, I've only beaten the game on normal (not the two higher difficulties).  I don't think I would enjoy it more on those difficulties, though.

Ghost stories is a really fun co-op that has been popular when I'm playing with non-gamers (which probably makes me like it a bit more than I would compared to others because my gaming buddies live far away). Don't get me wrong, I know gamers who like it too...but after so many games winning strategies seem to appear and I get more enjoyment when I add more bosses. Some plays are different than others and I've lost the game in 5 minutes after a long stream of haunters. The biggest downside is that the rules can be confusing...especially if one has never played it before. Still, I have never regretted my purchase. I just need my enjoyment coupled with variety from other games.

Played seven times with 2 and 4 and absolutely loved it. The free Essen '08 giveaway (a village tile and some additional ghosts) seems a worthwile little expansion. The game is quite easy to grasp if explained to you, but the manual takes a little bit of getting used to and is structured in an unintuitive way. Moreover, the German rules are definitely a bit clearer than the English ones. The whole package, however, is awesome - artwork is impressive, theme is appealing and well implemented and turns are fast. Cannot wait to play again! My only concerns are that the game seems to be much harder to win with two than it would be with four, and that it has (and I hate to say this) limited replayability. But only time will tell...
UPDATE: Played it more and have grown to like it more, although the game (in general) is a little bit too hard to beat. After 12 games, we finally managed to win a single game on normal level! Still, everybody I introduced it to wanted to give it a try because of the theme and its great looks. Surely a a good addition to my collection, although I still like Pandemic a l i t t l e bit better. In general, however, I am not a big fan of co-op games, since the replayability of this type of game always seems a bit limited.

Pretty solid coop game. Mind you, I am not a huge coop fan. I find pandemic to be relatively bland and shadows over camelot overly dramatic. However, ghost stories has mesh the theme with game play extremely well. The feeling of this games when I play it is quite intense and also relatively tough even under normal conditions. It poses quite a challenge. Which is good since coops should remain challenging to maintain multiple plays.

Finally beat the game after six times. Tense decision making. Like many coops, it can be a little programmed with one player taking the lead and telling people what to do. However, the difficulty of Ghost Stories gives a good replay value. My six-year old daughter now requests this game as a favorite.

A hit with the boys.

I read a few of the low rated comments to get a feel why some people don't like this game. "Yatzhee I killed a ghost." "The die won the game." "No real decisions." "Too hard." "Frustrating when its hard to move and then fail on a dice roll." They are playing it wrong. The dice are just for "saving tokens". 

This is resource management co-op. If you take on ghost without the corresponding tao-token, luck is your only hope. Share tokens (stand in the same spot as another taoist when exorcising) and stock up on token all the time. 

My kids and I love playing this game. The dice add suspense, but don't make or break a game if you play with the right strategy.

RATING: 5
Initial impression - limited plays

Seems too difficult and luck dependent.  I have seen the "advice" for strategy here on the geek, and would like to play some games with the people that win on the harder difficulty levels, because I just don't see how. 

2009-09-11 - Increased score to 5.  Game is growing on me slightly, but I still tend to enjoy other co-ops more.

Christmas present from my cool Secret Santa 2009.  Pandemic and Witch of Salem have really whet my appetite for coop games.  I love the theme and art of this game.  Since, it is expandable I think it will have a high replay value.

RATING: 8
[i]"Very good. Like to play, will probably suggest it, will never turn it down."[/i]

The best table-talkable (i.e. not Space Alert or Hanabi) co-op I've played as proper attention has been given to the mechanics, difficulty and predictability without sacrificing theme. Difficult and variable without feeling unfair, trivial or predetermined like Robinson Crusoe can.

Could move down if I tire of co-op games.

Update: Dropped to 8 simply because we don't play co-ops very often. It is still the best classic co-op (not counting Mage Knight)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
One of my least favorite co-ops.  It feels like there are fewer interesting decisions to make (generally I feel like my choices are pretty limited and often obvious - whereas in most co-ops I usually feel less sure of what I want to do).  There are still more good decisions than something like Shadows Over Camelot, but I find them lacking for some reason.

Additionally, the tension is often not quite as exciting as most alternatives.  It is still present, but a bit lacking.

I thought I'd like Ghost Stories a bit more than I actually did. I like cooperative board games, but this one seems like you never have hope the entire time you are playing it. I love the fact that it's very strategic and you absolutely need to maximize your moves and utilize your players special ability as well as that of the village tiles. I just wish I had more "yes!" moments while playing besides the end. It's a great looking game with excellent components. Plays in about an hour if you know who you are playing with and 2, 3 or 4 players all works good (I don't like the single player). Oh and iOS app is great too.

Fun game, very cool theme. However, it seems more random than other cooperative games like Pandemic. That said, it could just be that it takes a while to get good at it.

I'm guessing amassing a wide array of tao tokens is key, so that you're not at the whim of the dice and good rolls are just icing on the cake.

Flew under my radar as another co-op game, this time with a theme that I don't care for (horror).  Well, turns out that the title of the game doesn't really do its theme justice.  I thought I would get cheap slasher horror theme, and we open up this game and it's set... in China?  In [i]feudal[/i] China?  With artwork that's at least as much fantasy as horror?  Sign me up!  The presentation is really gorgeous.  The art is dark and beautiful, and the pieces appropriately looming and dynamic.  The components are backed up by an interesting and tense ruleset.  There's randomness and risk-taking that really keeps things interesting.  If you like co-ops, at least give this one a look, and consider buying.  This is the best pure cooperative game since [gameid=823].

The rules sometimes seem blurry but once you read them over a few times you get them right. And then the problem begins - the game is so unbelievably difficult that you might want to throw it against the wall right after the first play (might even happen half-way into the very first game). Is that the type of challenge you want to take on? 

It's all up to you though :)

As much as I like these sorts of games I seem to have problems finding peers who would share my enthusiasm. This one requires quite a lot of patience, thorough thinking, luck and willpower. It will take a while until you "beat the game" for the first time. After that it will depend how more often you will want to suffer through it.

A brilliant cooperative game that's unbelievably hard. It will drive you insane, you will die... You will vow to do better next time, play again, die...

After about 30 sessions, you may narrowly win. Before promptly losing again.

The pieces are gorgeous and the gameplay is novel. The rulebook sucks though, but Boardgamegeek and various other websites have lots of advice on how to play.

We've played two player, and that works well. Recommended without hesitation to anyone who doesn't mind losing repeatedly to a board.

Replay value is good, but you get burned out after a while.

This game is much, much tighter than other cooperative games I've played, but it makes it more challenging to me, because I'm determined to beat it.  Just be aware that this is much less of a forgiving game than Pandemic or Red November.  The theme here is very appealing, and the mechanisms actually work with the theme, and the bits are wonderful.  It's just such a great experience seeing the game wind down into disaster, as you struggle to stay afloat long enough to finally defeat the ghosts.

Many fell putting an end to the reign of terror of Wu-Feng, Lord of the Nine Hells. The funerary urn housing his ashes was buried in the cemetery of a village in the Middle Empire.
\13\\13\
Years have passed, and the cursed legacy has been forgotten by the living. Hidden away in Hell, Wu-Feng has forgotten nothing. His incessant research allowed him to locate the receptacle. The shadow of his former incarnation already extends to the villagers, who are unaware of the danger threatening them.
\13\\13\
Fortunately, the Fat-Si (Taoist priests) keep watch, guarding the border between the dead and the living. Armed with their courage, their faith, and their powers, they will try to return the reincarnation of Wu-Feng to Hell.

Although this game absolutely drips with theme, mechanically it's a pretty abstract affair. Still, the game presents an interesting and difficult puzzle to solve, making it one of the best (and hardest) cooperative games out there. Every decision is brutally tough to make and often the game will go from completely under control to absolute disaster with a single flip of a card. If you want to win, you have to play perfectly...and after you finally do win, there are a quite a few ways to make future plays even harder on yourself.

This game is hard. Mind you, my Pandemic record is something like 1-8, so I'm not the best coop gamer, but I'll still play Pandemic because, after the game, I can usually look back and think "OK, we shouldn't have done that" and the game was close enough that it makes me want to try again. This game is so hard that I don't even want to try to get better at it. It wasn't fun to just continually get pummeled, and I don't know what we could've done differently that would've bought us more than maybe a couple of turns. The only way I'd want to play this again would be with a person who has won before (so I can understand it better) or if I find out we got a rule wrong (in which case, I'll withdraw my rating). I'm not crazy about fully cooperative games in general, and this wasn't my least favorite of them (that would be Red November), so take that into consideration. I'm sure people who routinely beat Pandemic on the highest difficulty would enjoy this, as there are some interesting design things going on here (which is why I rate it as highly as I do). It just was not fun for me.

After three plays, I don't feel like there's much interesting happening. I generally love games with a high degree of crunch and particularly love loss and defeat. I guess my brain's a bit too Euro wired to get much out of just moving, selecting a tile action or carrying out combat.

The ghost cycle of 2 is necessary and works well for the game, so there's probably not much that can be done with it, I just feel like there should be more intricate mechanisms at play to form a more dense dynamic.

As always though, with the right people, it's enjoyable so by no means is it a bad game, just not suited to my tastes.

RATING: 9
UPDATE: Now I've played a lot of "4p solo" games (just me, taking on roles of all 4 monks, instead of using Power Tokens), and my esteem for this game keeps rising.  It's incredibly clever and replayable.  I'm not sold on the expansion integration (some village tiles are more essential than others), and it's definitely too hard to be a family game (as it sort of appears, though some images are pretty horrific; my kids find it creepy and dislike it).
-----------
UPDATE: Lots more solo plays now, and I'm winning on Hell (maybe 60%, doubt it will go up).  Unfortunately, I've hit a bit of a wall, as my heuristics are now (too) entrenched, and they work.  Very much looking forward to the expansion.
-----------
UPDATE: Having a solo option means I've played this a lot in only a week, and I'm winning in standard mode now after a few early losses.  But it's not really a solo option: this is basically a solitaire game.  More players, but without any hidden information, just means more brains around the table, as it's the exact same puzzle for everyone.  Not a knock, really, and it's a very clever puzzle, but this brings nothing new to the coop genre.
-------------
Beautiful artwork.  Iconography, not so much.  Have to confess some confusion about the rave reactions here: I don't see that it solves any common coop problems, and it's also very abstract.  But hey, I don't have those problems, and I like abstracts.

This is a great cooperative game that is fun, challenging and lends itself well to expansions.  My only complaint about the base game is that it could use more "story" elements in addition to just running around beating on ghosts. Perhaps if the ghost deck also include some unique events (good and bad) this would help make the experience feel more like a story and less like "wack-a-mole".

There's a "Euro-optimization" crossed with relentless brutal puzzle,  based on solo play.  Tough,  but winnable.  A dash of grand strategy,  but lots of turn-by-turn wrenches from the evil "Yin Phase" probably means long-term plans can be easily ruined.

Art looks fantastic,  theme is migrated upwards to a mild win.  Might be a good replacement for Arkham Horror - always happy to compactify the "punch per second" effect. The "open hand coop" == "solitaire" worries me a bit.

Ghost Stories is a chillingly tense (and difficult) game and is, in my experience, perfectly executed.  Ghost Stories is a co-op that accomodates from 1 to 4 players and honestly plays just as well with any of those player counts.

The players feel constantly overwhelmed (albeit, excitedly so) during the game.  Everytime they seem like they're breaking even, another obstacle rears its ugly head and has the players scrambling to deal with it.

Although the onslaught against the players is relentless, they will find that they have so many options and strategies available to them and, carefully managed, those strategies can lead to fantastic, white-knuckle victories.

This is one of the most exciting, challenging and outright fun games I've ever played.  The components are gorgeously produced, the game is completely tight and streamlined and the gameplay has an incredible arc, with a slow build-up in the initial rounds, culminating in a furious and nail-biting climax.

A supreme example of how to create an engaging and challenging cooperative game.

I'd have this rated higher if not for the soul-crushing difficulty.  The artwork is absolutely stunning.  The theme is great (Chinese fantasy is rarely visited in boardgames).  The mechanics are sound.  And of course I love cooperative games.  The problem is that the game is ridiculously hard.  My group has a pretty decent win percentage on Pandemic (even with six Epidemics and an expansion variant), and even Space Alert (with yellow threats!).  We rarely come close to winning Ghost Stories, even on its "normal" difficulty level.  Kind of a shame, since everything else about it puts it squarely in my wheelhouse.

So relentless against overwhelming odds.  Things are mostly out of your control and heavily reliant on dice luck.  But, I still love playing this game.  My gaming group? Not so much.  To have any chance, make sure to spawn the ghosts at the corners! Make sure to keep those Buddhas in action to destroy the big toughies. Helps a lot to team up on ghosts to mitigate luck with artifacts.

What sets it apart is that it is a very tense co-op. This is because it constantly feels like you're shoveling water out of a sinking boat, trying to stay afloat. I like that it is difficult, although I did feel that you sometimes had it under control and just with bad luck you suddenly lose, without really been able to do anything about it ... but this only happend once.

All in all, great co-op for people who like a challenge.

RATING: 7
This is probably my favorite co-op game. The theme is certainly not over-done, (Chinese ghost infested town), and this game carries the theme very, very well. I never feel that the theme was ‘pasted on’ to the mechanisms of the game…they integrate so well and make sense.

The depictions of various residents of the town and their abilities help flavor the game with the unique theme, and the ghost...those dreadful, incessant, wicked ghost… pose a challenge that really keeps you on your co-operative toes. Cooperation with fellow players is crucial to winning.

The White Moon expansion does add elements to the townsfolk that I enjoy, and do not play without currently.

The sum of it's parts is perfect. This game is challenging, rewarding, and thematic. I've not played a better coop game than this.

Update 10/4/2017: This game remains the best game I've ever played. It is challenging, beautiful, and accessible all at the same time. Artwork is lovely, Components are top quality, and it's my most played game of all time. When my kids are grown and look back to their childhood, Ghost Stories will be the game that gets remembered as the quintessential board game.

Ghost Stories is a quality production, although it does share certain characteristics with other cooperative games.

In terms of GS's qualities of "sameness", the game includes unique player abilities, a constant barrage of danger and dread, multiple ways to lose, and a focus on killing an evil overlord. These same elements can be found (piecemeal) in Pandemic, Shadows over Camelot, Lord of the Rings, Vanished Planet, and Arkham Horror.

However, the theme in GS is neat, the game art is ferociously attractive, and GS does contribute a handful of newness to the cooperative game field: location-based special actions, dice-driven combat mitigated by power chits, an over-the-top difficulty level, and oddly-named minions of evil.

As noted elsewhere, though, all information in GS is completely open, which means that there’s a real possibility that a single experienced player can dominate the entire proceedings, which would be entirely unfun.

Finally, GS has proven that the general gaming community is willing to put up with an inordinate amount of die-rolling, as long as there are no actual numbers on the dice.  Colors and symbols on die faces are OK, I guess, but standard dice apparently leave a wargame/Ameritrash aftertaste.  Fair enough.  I’ve now learned a lesson about game marketability and design.

[i]Update[/i]:

After six years of off-and-on enjoyment, I'm not sure that my body can handle another ghost ulcer.  This game is just impossible to win (10% success rate?), even at the easiest level.  Anyone arguing otherwise is [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/121361/ghost-stories-official-big-faq]playing incorrectly[/url].

Still fun occasionally (Halloween), preferably with the "we take pity on you" White Moon expansion and a spooky soundtrack.

RATING: 7
Good game, certainly. I understand it's high ranking but feel that it's utter randomness prevents it from being an  excellent  game- at least for me. This is truly a co-operative game in the sense that all players must be cohesive and work closely together in order to optimize their moves on the board in such a way as to successfully combat the enemies as they are brought into play. I suspect Ghost Stories would be more enjoyable with more than 2 players, although it certainly can be played by 2 or even as a solo game.

The base game is awesome, but White Moon makes it astounding.  The ability to wipe out major problems with the four-crystal ritual (I forget what it's called) creates a rhythm over the course of the game of calm, panic, relief, panic, relief, panic...  instead of just a continually escalating difficulty.

My first 2-player game started out rather easy, but soon overwhelmed us with ghosts, hauntings & Tormentors. We had one chance to exorcise the Incarnation before the ghosts killed off one player Taoist (me!), but failed to roll 3 black on 4 dice, and with just one Taoist and one active board it was all over...

This game feels like rolling downhill in an unpowered cart - you need to spend every second controlling everything at once for the times you have to avoid the inevitable potholes and obstacles!

Difficult, quick Coop.  I play this game when I want a challenge.  Whenever I get too good, I just increase the difficulty level. (I also have the expansions so I put in and take out those for variety as well)

I play it solo the most since there needs to be so much coordination between people, but if you play with people that will not fear equally sharing their opinions and accepting those of others, it can work fine.  Can easily have one person telling everyone else what to do otherwise.

One of the best cooperative games out there. The Asian ghost story theme is widely recognised and familiar in Singapore, adding to the enjoyment. The designer has obviously done his research, including well-known artifacts such as glutinous rice (wards off vampires!), Taoist mirrors, incense sticks, and talismans in the game. This has replaced Shadows over Camelot as the cooperative game of choice in my group. Works well with casual gamers too.

(Trade Interest: low) i like the theme, and the degree to which you have to cooperate with the other players.  it has lots of interesting mechanics, and good graphics.  i think it is WAY too difficult, and though you can get better at it, i would not want to play very often unless the difficulty were adjusted down.  i mean, it's not fun to lose 90% of the time.  further thoughts on the game come with more plays: the cooperation aspect is too much group-think for there to be much fun.  Everyone has to agree and execute their moves perfectly, or it will result in a loss.  there is no individuality, and that makes the game not much fun, except as an exercise in four people making an agreement.  will never surpass Arkham Horror on the coop game front.

I pretty much solved the game after my initial quick 10 solitaire games, but finally played it with another friend, and enjoyed it a whole lot more, especially as we got our butts handed to us. I tend to always love losing cooperative games, and then trying to get revenge.

Gorgeous artwork with a very familiar theme to me personally (I grew up watching Chinese ghost and zombie movies after all).  This was probably the one game I looked forward the most to trying out of Essen 2008.  Well, I'm sad to say that my first experience with it left me kind of disappointed.

Ghost Stories is far from easy.  Your situation can go from good to bad in the blink of an eye.  Every decision you make as a group will be meaningful, so there are never really any wasted actions.  Unfortunately, the mechanics of each turn felt very procedural: resolve the bad actions, draw a ghost card, perform a good action, rinse and repeat.  Now don't get me wrong, I know very well that strictly speaking all boardgames are just the same set of steps one take over and over again.  However, in Ghost Stories that just stuck out like a sore thumb to me.  While the tension is there, but I was never truly immersed in the play to make it seem less obvious.

I liked it ok, but certainly failed to be the definitive co-op title I was hoping for.

Update #1: Bumped the rating up by half a point.  Subsequent plays were a lot more enjoyable.  It's all about maximizing your actions and not to perform any risky ones that will net you nothing.  I've also taught it several times.  Ghost Stories is actually legitimately hard with tension, and I would say a much better game than Pandemic.

This has to be in my top 3 list!  This game is close to perfect for my taste!

The game play is outstanding!  Every session is fun, challenging and rewarding... especially if you win as it can be really tough.  A lot of planning went into the production of this game and it is very apparent.

The game components are next to perfect.  Everything from the minatures to the game tiles, chits and cards are very high-quality and intricately detailed.  I would have to say that these components are more than worth the price of the game!   

The artwork is enticing!  Honestly, this game could win an award for best illustrations!  Not only does the artwork do an excellent job projecting the theme, but it is as alluring as the game play!  I am usually not very fond of comic books, anime, etc., but these illustrations really play into the theme flawlessly.

This has to be my favorite from Asmodée!

I've sort of lost my enjoyment for collaborative games, due primarily to the problem of the experienced or bossy player pretty much playing the game solo, using the other players as extra hands.  Ghost Stories, however, throws so much at you so hard and so fast and on such a small playfield, that it mitigates this problem.  You pretty quickly get trench camaraderie as the four (or fewer) of you sit in a tiny, 3×3 grid, fending off an eternal onslaught of ghosts from all sides.

Fun solo game!  I played all four Taoists, and the game didn't disappoint.  Starts out with a nice slow burn, and the intensity ratchets up throughout the game.  I may not have gotten every rule correct, but it was a nail biter with only two Taoists still standing when I pulled Wu-Feng and made a mad scramble to put him down.

It's a much better game than those two, but the draconian nature of the challenge means that people will often give up rather than continue playing.  Once the board looks hopeless it usually IS hopeless...and the board looks hopeless a lot.

I don't know how to rate this game. It's an amazingly complex game which generally is excellent for me, but it is so hard that it felt like work

This game is so much fun either as a solo experience and a co-op experience. It´s not overly complicated although there are some rules that will take some time to get used to. The components are of great quality and the artwork is amazing. You'll find that this game is HARD. This one needs to be played several times untill the group gets better, and then you can make the game more and more difficult so there's always a good challenge to be had. Highly recommended.

I hate this game so much. I've gotten so close but never been able to beat it. One day, Ghost Stories. One day.

After 1 play: I'm not really a big fan of co-ops, and this did nothing to change that.  It fails to address the two inherent problems of the genre--namely, that one player can just dictate everyone's moves, and that whether you win or not feels more a consequence of how the deck got shuffled than any meaningful decisions you made.

Like it a lot. I was a bit confused at first (for one thing, I had a hard time grasping what the player boards represented!), but I think the game works very well as a co-op. It's less obvious what you should do than in Pandemic, strangely abstract yet much more concrete than Lord of the Rings. I like the variation the simple modular village layout allows for, and it's fun to groan at the constant danger that sort of closes in from all four directions.

I just wonder how the hell you'll ever survive Nightmare mode, let alone Hell. I haven't even cleared Normal!

Brutal co-op game.  Just the way it should be.

It's tough as nails, especially since we seem to be unlucky at 2p, and tend to randomly remove all the 1-hit cards from the game, leaving all of the 4-hit horrors. But it's a great change of pace co-op for when Pandemic is feeling too easy.

Hardest to win coop game I have played until now. It actually has a puzzle element, especially if you add the expansion and has lots of decisions to be made. It's also hard to win. It has one of the best art styles of my collection. Clearly a lot of attention was put into the atmosphere. 

Since you have quite some decisions to make during your turn, the leader(that tells you what to do) problem is bigger than in other coops.

As a non-geek I was surprised by the style of the game: first that it's a coop game and than, after playing it for a couple of times and getting used to the difficult and numerous rules, the method; I have never played such a game before and I adored it.
However, for non-geeks it is an extremely hard game with rare feelings of success; so we invented the "luck dice", aided our decision with the philosophical notion: "yeah, life is hard, but not THAT much and sometimes you may be lucky!". 
It works like this: change one of the village cards for the blank one at start. You can use the luck dice as it's help; you may roll it only once. The dice is white with 6 sides, 2 of them is empty -- nothing happens; the rest 4 possibilities: turn back 1 haunted village, you can have your yin yang token back, you can destroy a ghost card (no curse, no reward), you can move the ghosts back on a gamer's card. We haven't tried it yet but I am sure it won't make the game much more easier; only a bit more life-like...
Summing the game: beautiful, exciting aaaand annoying – just like a fine woman. :)

An incredibly challenging co-op game and because of this plays quickly, mainly because you keep losing. The rules can be a bit confusing, as are player powers, but fortunately there's enough online documentation to help sort that out. Picture a Final Fantasy battle and that's what Ghost Stories is... for 45 minutes.

An intense, and intensely beautiful, game. It can be a bit difficult to grasp but offers both the clean and efficient mechanics of typical German games and the fun thematic powers employed by many of the French designers. A good combination.

The expansions for this game (White Moon and Black Secret) are also great, adding plenty of new excitement while not complicating things too much.

Maybe I need to play again, but I didn't feel like my decisions had that much influence over whether we won or lost. If you play poorly you'll almost certainly lose, but I'm not sure playing well will be rewarded more often than not.

But again, I probably need to play again to make sure that's true.

说实话，游戏难度有点大，而且策略可控性较差，如开局运气稍差点的话，团灭是很正常的事情。IOS版更适合单人挑战，是款比较挑人的游戏。不知道加了一扩二扩的对抗模式后，耐玩性上是否有更大的提升。。。

Car Wars is like an old friend that I've known for years.  Yes, he has certain flaws, but I'll always be there for him and he'll be there for me.  It's the first game that I ever really got into very deeply, and I'll always be ready to play it -- who's up for a game?

Say what you like about it taking a while to play through what turns out to only be a few seconds in the game world.  There's nothing quite like ramming a civilian with your beat up car and your car's engine taking enough damage from the impact to be destroyed.  Actually, I think that was the event that made my brother quit playing.

I still had a lot of fun, though.  We'd design our vehicles then unleash them on each other, chewing up armor with machineguns until someone's little driver-cum-damage sink's head hit the steering wheel.  Tee-hee.

I bought this because I loved [thing=37061]Star Fleet Battles[/thing]  and thought this would kind of be like a simplified version of it on the ground.  It kind of is, but I just wasn't that impressed with the game.  Some have said it's more fun to select a car than to play the game.  I am the opposite.  I didn't like making the car -- too fiddly.  I wrote a computer program to create it.  If I can tweak it a little, I will put it up for download.

I played this a few times in the 80s and 90s, and spent much more time designing cars and scenarios than I ever did actually playing it. It suffered from accumulated kruft over time, but it was still awfully fun if about as realistic a simulation of combat automobiles as PanzerBlitz is a realistic simulation of tank warfare.

This brings you right back into the early 80s. It is not as complicated as it looks. But all in all it is tedious and very fiddly to play. A sandbox mix between a wargame and a role playing game.

You can play this solo, but for me it is just too much work without being rewarding. And i usually like solo role playing with light rules and improvised storytelling (using the Mythic GM Emulator or even lighter similar tools).

I must be missing the point somewhere, because people have raved to me about this game over the years, and although I've tried it on several occasions, I found it SLOW, badly produced, and totally uninspiring. 
This could be in part due to the people running it, but after three attempts with three different people, this turkey gets the thumbs down. I'll stick to "Battlecars".

My favorite board game of all time!!!
First bought the 1 pages folded brochure and by 1988 owned everything I could find.  

Great game for young and old, new or seasoned.  We had a multi year campaign, but would also just make up cars and scenarios for one offs.

Duel track was a MUST have!!

I know the basic set has been re-released, it's a shame S.J. Games doesn't offer pay for print and play downloads.

This IS oldschool gaming.  It is book and rules heavy and you will spend more time planning and building than playing- that's how we did it in the 80's!

Great game.  Great concept.  Love how vehicle design was treated and how simple and elagant damage was applied.  Spent hours covering counters in contact paper/tape and creating bases for MicroMachines and other small toy cars.  I just wish the high speed aspects of car combat weren't slowed so much, as the rules from my version required a phase-like treatment and took the 'feel' right out of the game.

I played this game pretty much non-stop from 1984 to 1991.  It is a great game - the whole idea of designing your own vehicles is what sold me on this.  I never really bought into the roleplaying side of it, the original game was more than enough for me.

The rules quickly became a mess or could have rated higher.  No longer own.

Great for its day, this is still an OK game if somewhat fiddly. Lots of record keeping makes the game very slow with multiple cars so it is most enjoyable with one or two vehicles each. A good proportion of the fun comes in designing your own vehicles within the tough weight and costs constraints. Still comes out occasionally just because of that.

And you can basically have any sort of scenario.

We played an awful lot of this at the time, and probably designed even more cars than were ever driven; with various supplements and magazine scenarios added to the mix.

Shame, as it was fun otherwise - let's see; a laser turret, some solid tires and ...

Nostalgia. One of those games where the setup (car creation) can be more fun than the actual gameplay. 

The primary problem I see with this game is the length of time it takes - Wait? Does that say 45 minute playing time?? I remember playing for hours and finding we had only accounted for less than a minute of actual time in the game. 

Easily adapted into an ongoing role-playing game, which can be even more fun.

Ah Car Wars...great concept, and playable as an RPG or a straight board game. Fun, but rules bog what seems like it'd be a fast paced game to a flat out crawl. Never play it anymore even though I'm fond of it on nostalgia value alone.

The hours I spent designing my own cars just to watch them destroyed in a giant free for all in about an hour!  I am a Car Wars fan, the original anyways.  When you could design, tweak, and set up some great cars, trucks, semis, boats, almost anything. I wish Jackson would release an updated version, but Deluxe is great.  I always used the counters and grid maps, although the newer rules added a 'turn counter' that negated the need for grid maps.

I assume there is a great game underneath if only I learnt not to destroy my car all the time :)

Great game that con be configured for many different types of play.  You can play an arena battle, or have a one-off race.  You can have a continuing character who gains stats and abilities (like an RPG).  You can control a cycle gang, a group a vigilantes, or a convoy of semi-trucks.  

So many options for customizing your vehicle.  Half the fun is building your own cars, then taking them into the arena against your friends.

The game jumped the shark when they added boats.  I never messed around with those, or the tanks and planes that followed.  The game is called Car Wars, not Vehicle Wars.

Most people play some amalgamation of the various rule sets that are out there.  I think the one I prefer is 3rd edition, or is it 3.1?  THe lateset edition had some neat innovations and a larger scale, but with no vehcile design rules ever published, half the fun is sucked out of the game system.

Used to play this a lot and, with the campaign rules, I eventually could put together a killer car none of my opponents could match. One of my favourite gaming moments was when an opponent put all his money into front armour (no weapons) and went on a ramming rampage while we tried to maneuver to his vulnerable rear. Very cool game, but probably dated if I pulled it out now.

AMAZING game (for its time).  Where OCD people go when they die.  Move over math homework, I gotta crunch some cost/mass balances.  God I miss some of my old drivers: Pete Bongo and that little yellow bug of his, how he did like to blast things.  Robert M. Chill jamming a Div 30 battlewagon with laser guided rockets.  Beautiful memories.  While I no longer have the time to play, those Uncle Albert's catalogs are some of the best bathroom reading since Manual of the Planes!

Loved this game and would still play today with a stripped-down rule set. Too many expansions for my taste as it became a bit too much. Plus, the original impulse move system was far better.  That being said, it's one of the great cardboard carnage games. Build a car [and every good driver always had a notebook full of 'em to pull from in a minute's notice] or design a track [if the 2 zillion pre-made ones didn't suit your fancy] and start rollin' dice. 

Like Circus Imperium, Car Wars, even with the RPG elements [which are far more akin Dawn Patrol's 'keep a pilot alive' approach than anything else], is a shoutin' good time.

It's hard to know how to rate this game since I haven't played it in 20 years.  I was in love with it at the time, but I hard a hard time finding people to play it with.  I think I played 5 games by myself, and two or three half-games with others.  This leads me to believe that it was too complicated.

I'd love to play a Eurofied version of this sometime...

Fourth Edition. Begging for a simper rules structure. This game is about min-maxing car designs and simulating real weight and scale of automobiles. It  needs to be about fast-paced autoduelling in a post-holocost wasteland, a la Mad Max: Roadwarrior. Begging for fast, streamlined interaction and abstracted car design. Play Silent Death instead, as it is in the same vein but much much better.

Was once my favorite game.
Has a few rule ambiguites that need to be settled, but if you look at http://cwhnj.com/madhat/carwars/misc/
you can find a couple documents that I helped create (the Car Wars Referee Questionnaire and Other Dueling Questions) which can help you answer those questions.  I had to drop it down a point and a half, as I don't go out of my way to organize gaming sessions focused around this game.  I think there are now only a few "optimal" designs for most dueling scenarios.  This negates the limitless variety that originally attracted me to the game.  Despite this there are still plenty of interesting decisions in both car design and in the game play itself.  If I had the energy and time, I'd tweak some of the weapons and accessory costs/weights to make more strategies viable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty fun, but the modifiers really bog it down.

I think that if you wrote down the modifiers for targeting various parts of the car on the record sheet itself, it would speed things up. I'll have to try that some day.

[1 play] I had a fun time playing this, and it was interesting to try it, but I don't think it's something I'll seek out.  This was my first experience with minis-style gaming.  I think I prefer games with a defined board, so you know which square (or hex, or whatever) your piece is on, rather than something where it's all precision and a fraction of an inch can make a huge difference, yet could equally well be caused by the players' lack of dexterity or someone jostling the table.

This can be a pretty great game if you're nerdy enough.  I almost am.  This is another game I've never lost, and I'm not sure why.  Each time I've done stupid things and deserved to lose, but the dice fell in my favor.  In fact, my first game ever, I was facing down a 5d6 gun and I had exactly 5 armor points left.  After losing that five points, I would be dead.  And I'm not making this up... the guy rolled five ones.  I yelled Yahtzee, then on my turn I took out his car and won the game.  He almost punched my in the face.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of my all time favorites.  Yes, it is a little inaccurate in terms of physics.  It can also be a bit time consuming to design new vehicles from scratch.  I find it does play fairly quickly if players stick to stock designs, or design their vehicles ahead of time.  I have most all of the supplements from the early eighties through the early nineties.  I've never played fifth edition.

Man, did I love the hell out of this game.  I used to spend hours transcribing rules so that my friend Drew and I both had rules for whatever crap one of us had just bought.  We didn't drive yet, so we never slowed down before turning.
Upon reflection, CW is a fair bit unrealistic, and cumbersome as well.  Nonetheless, it's really cool how much stuff you can do, so despite the fact that I never play this game, I kinda dig it.

I haven't played Car Wars in years, but when I was into it, boy howdy did I ever play a lot of Car Wars.  While playing the game is fun, I think I enjoy creating the cars even more, something made particularly enjoyable by the descriptions of all the tools of mayhem available to you in the Uncle Al's catalog.  In fact, the sheer amount of world building available (up to and including the inevitable GURPS supplements) makes the game a treat to play when you really get into it.  That's it, I'm totally dusting off my old pocket box and bringing it to the local Game Night.

I have two copies of this, one in the plastic pocket box, and the Deluxe Edition that included the original game and several supplements in one box with a consolidated rulebook.

The idea of the game always fascinated me, but the actual play always seemed a bit too fiddly, not to mention unrealistic with multiple decisions being made every second.  Something which seems to be a theme with Steve Jackson's designs, as his later GURPS RPG suffered from the same unrealistic second by second combat system.

O' Skool Chaos! Despite the record keeping, its still the ultimate car battle game, with its excellent modification system. As for the complexity and fiddly nature of the beast... I think Circus Maximus is much more annoying and with much less style.  For those solo players among you, there adventure add-ons allow for solitaire play and you could easily create solitaire situations to play with.  (as usual, its more fun with many players.)

Only thing I didn't like about the game was all the many expansions... just cost way too much to get them all... many of which didn't add that much more to an otherwise good game.  (don't get me wrong... I would love to own them all :) )

I lowered my rating from 9 to 6. While I respect this game, there are too many rules and die rolls relative to the actual actions you take. Downtime can be a real drag. It doesn't satisfy my gaming itch. 

Earlier comment:

My rating is based on playing this game in brilliant, elborately constructed and newbie friendly sessions run by the[url=http://torontoautoduelassociation.wordpress.com/] Toronto Autoduel Assocation[/url]. Car Wars is a reconstruction of the highest pitch of drama and intensity in an action film, only it is more realistic and far less predictable than an action film. Car Wars offers sophisticated gameplay wrapped in compelling and momorable narratives of chase and escape.

Another game that I played more in my youth.  My brother and I used to run tournaments at Gen Con back in the Milwaukee days; as well as playing with friends at home.  My brother, our friend Ted, and I even came up with "TBC Autowerks," our moniker for the company that designed and built the cars that players picked randomly for the many Gen Con sessions.  We even ran a Boat Wars once that was quite popular.  I'd love to play this again sometime.  Ever seen a player roll a bus at 80 mph?

The idea is great—but it takes a real hour to process 30-seconds worth of game-time action...  So one hour later you've turned left, started to skid, and fired one burst from your machine gun.  [i]Buh.[/i]

RATING: 3
I like the theme, so I played many scenarios, designed many cars and even memorized most of the hit modifiers (and had much fun with it). But after that initial rage, I realized that this game is TOO COMPLEX. So many tables, rules, mathwork... you need 3 hours to simulate 30 seconds of fighting. I can't find the time nor commitment to play again.

The theme, concept and mechanics have a great potential, but must be reworked (simplified) to make them more accesible.

Played this in the 80's. Usually it would take longer to build your car than the actual game (but some might find that fun). In one game we almost started when a guy discovered that he had forgot to mount wheels on his car... putting the wheels on changed the weight and wrecked his entire design (it was a killer car - except for the no-wheels thing).

Still love it, although haven&#039;t actually played in years.  It&#039;s a labor of love to play Car Wars...  the designing, the layout, measuring, calculating, arguing...

I actually got the original edition that came in the zip-bag.  The store manager tossed it out because he thought it wouldn't sell!  I took it home and taught my friends to play it.

I used to love this game in junior high and high school, and would spend an inordinate amount of time designing cars and the like.  I haven't played it much recently, and the whole thing kind of fell over under its own weight, but I adored this at the time.

RATING: N/A
Haven't played since highschool... going to hold off rating till I can play again.  We used to have a blast with this one. We'd give everybody a certain dollar amount and then spend a few hours building our cars: one friend might go for tricking out one huge killer car while another would go for a bunch of cycles/trikes...  then we'd send them all into the arena for mass carnage.  This would usually take an entire afternoon, but was sooo much fun.

A remake of this could have been incredible... but after seeing how harshly SJGames treats some of their fans, I'm staying away from the company.

The first game I ever bought... and the one I've played the most.  Even with just the "pocket box edition", it has one of the best ongoing campaign systems ever made.  The ease with which you can shift from from roleplaying to tactical combat is unmatched.  The design and repair rules are the standard with which all other such systems are compared.

I have never been a real fan of miniatures games, or customizable games either for that matter, so Car Wars has two strikes against it from the start.

RATING: 8.5
The greatest autodueling board game ever created.  So why a rating of 8.5?  Because of the game's packaging & total reliance on paper (counters, maps, charts, etc.) & pencil--this IS a game of the 80's.  SJG should've really invested in this game & made cool miniatures & road sections for it.  If you're going to rely on counters to represent the cars, then they should have used a heavier stock of paper/card board--like the kind Fantasy Flight Games produces.  As a matter of fact, SJG should licence this game to FFGs.

This game is a relic of the 1980s that should have stayed there.  I can see how this would have been a hit back then, but it is desperately in need of a modern revamp.  This game is for people who love simulations and role playing.  AS is, it simply can't compete with the board games of today, but I could see how it would do well as a smartphone app.  I gave up on learning all the rules when I realized that there is no way I could ever convince anyone to play it.

Happily sold; hopefully, to someone who will appreciate it.

My circle of friends in High-school played this about five or six times.  The design had a lot of promise, but we were playing black-box edition where there were something like 10 impulses per Turn.

Love the game. Hate the bloat.

We found that the sweet spot for this was running it with as few expansions as possible. Let it be for what it is, a great CAR battle game. 

Very fun for my group as there were lots of rules for the combats, and the RP section is very very fast and loose. We enjoyed playing it as a ROLE playing game as the only parts of the game that had hard and fast rules were the combats. Other than that the system was pretty open about what the PC's could do. Worked very well with my group (30+ year olds).

In the 80's, this was one of the best games out there.  It captured so many people's imaginations.  It had so many good supplements and such good flavor.  It was a central part of my formative gaming years.  Nowadays it plays probably too lengthy and too fiddly for people's tastes.  So I must give it a 7, though in the 80's it was an 8 or 9.  Great metagame building your car on a budget, fine-tuning it for the task at hand.

It is not a bad game as it is in itself.  The system works and the game has a dose of fun.  But it really is too weird in feeling as you can imagine any weaponry in a car.  You soon loose interest in a game that is weak on a defined background story, upon which many sci-fi games are hanging onto for you to be really &quot;in&quot;.  So sad, it has not been carefully developed into a major cult in its own right.

Yeah. Well. Car Wars. Fast cars. Big guns. Crazy drivers. Post-apocalyptic stuff. Custom motorcycles with attached scythes. Sounds like big fun until you play it.

Excellent fun and mayhem! Build your own car, outfit it with all the weapons it can carry, and go smash the other cars! Unfortunately the design of cars is a highly specialised skill - experienced designers can optimise a design to get a lot more than a novice on the same budget. 

Some pieces of equipment are too powerful, to a degree where they will render most other options obsolete (ATG and metal armor, I'm looking at you two), other things like the armoured beer fridge should simply be banned. 

The alternative is predesigning cars, or let everybody use the same design (but then you loose the fun of designing them in the first place)

Gameplay can easily drag on, especialy with more players; If you want to have more than 4 players, you will need an iron will and discipline.

Car design can be speeded up greatly using our in-house spreadsheet :)

Ah, I played the hell out of Car Wars in the 80s. My group used the character experience rules to make it into a RPG experience. We played more Car Wars than anything else. The mechanics for simulating movement were wonderful, but time consuming. Later editions refined the system, retaining the excellent mechanics but cutting the game time in half. The combat rules were scaled small and simple, but were also perfectly balanced. The system expanded relentlessly through the 80s, then, sadly, the player base cratered in the 90s. Survives only as a relic now. Deserves better. It is an awesome game.

It was good in its day, but that day was a long time ago. I was never a big fan of the freeform, miniatures-style movement, and always wished the game would morph into a standard hex or square grid system for ease of play.

Quite enjoyable when you design your own vehicles and have a solid theme. The best Car Wars game I ever played was at a college con -- the theme was Bus Wars, with campus buses and a rampage across a nearby part of campus. Good stuff.

Back when I played semi-regularly, I'd have given it a higher rating. But that was years ago, and I've since cooled on it a bit. The fiddly-ness factor is just a bit too high (it's more complicated to introduce to non-wargamers than it looks, for example).

We're a competetive group, but with this we just crash into each other and ram each other into wall for the hell of it, not thinking about winning.  The production values are quaint by modern standards, you know when you're prit-sticking things onto cereal boxes that you're dealing with the 1980's!

Very thematic, excellent simulation of vehicular combat. The rules for frequent actions like moving and shooting are fairly simple, but the rules for less frequent actions like collisions, falling, etc. can sometimes be a bit overwrought. I love the vehicle-building, the setting, and the accuracy of the system, though!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is definitely a cool concept: Driving around an arena, shooting stuff up. It is actually a pretty fun game, although designing the cars is ultimately more fun than playing. A duel that takes many minutes to game usually represents (in game time) only a few seconds.
It's a shame that this is so fiddly, because it's a game I wouldn't mind playing again.
The wealth of supplementary material and RPG applicability made this a very useful game, too.

I like the game.  Just can't find people willing to commit time to play.  Best when played fast and furious and not caring too much about making mistakes.  Building the cars or bikes the most fun; the duels are almost a sideshow.  Maybe I could try this solo.

Oy. What to say about this... MUCH MUCH too complicated. Having to measure movement in one inch increments was really tedious and made the game take WAY too long. A game that requires a degree in physics isn't really all that exciting. On the plus side, designing the cars was fun, the backstory was pretty good, and the general destructive mayhem made for a good time. A decent game hidden within the rules, that simply died under its own massive weight.

Flashback from the 1980s.  Inspired by Mel Gibson's Roadwarrior movies, Car Wars and its legion of add-ons does a fine job a recreating the feel of heavily armored cars battling on the desolate highways of the future.  However, the tedious nature of the game play is the major drawback of this game. Award: Charles S. Roberts Best Science Fiction Boardgame (1981).

I played it to the death. Drawn my own arenas, built my own cars, played with pedestrians (Ob-racing rules), boats, hovercrafts, bikes, trucks, even with planes a couple of times... I think this is the greatest game I've ever played, expecially after it entered "completed" status with the release of the compendium (ok, we still had to change jumping rules after that, but that was the final change needed). If you love cars, spending a lot of time trying to build the best combo you can imagine to win your next race, devising some unique strategies for each arena, get a compendium and an Uncle Al's Catalog from Hell and... welcome to 2054.

This really was a fun game, I used to spend hours designing vehicles.  The "points match" games are a little limited and to develop the game as an RPG-type took an awful lot of effort by the game master without much assistance from the rules!  If you had someone willing to make the effort, however, this is a great game!

That is certainly what happened with this game.

I remember clearly, picking up this box in the game store having just watched Mad Max, the Road Warrior back in the mid '80's.  This game came close to bringing that movie to life on my table.  The complex car design was a strong point.  I hear they've tightened up some of the rules, and the game will be rereleased in Oct. '14.  I may have to go back to that game store...

As someone else put it, complexity without depth. Fiddly. Too many exceptional cases. Car design startegically breakable. marketing model based on continual churn and feature creep.

The game that started it all for me - got me past Monopoly and Yahtzee.  We played this for 10 years.

It's still a good game, I just don't have the patience to take 3 hours before a game to prep my vehicle for a game that will take 10 minutes (happened once, I died at the end of the first turn) to 4 hours.  

Lots of rules look-up while playing, even with ample cheat sheets.

I had a big collection that never seemed to get played, including the ridiculous Helicopters expansion. Car Wars was fiddly and tiresome, although the theme was great. Badly dated now. Who could bothered with all those modifiers and dice rolls and skill checks while keeping track of the speeds of 10 different cars? 

If there is a KS campaign, it will be huge - but don't expect much of an improvement from a game that is a trophy child for the all encompassing "lifestyle" game of the 1980s.

I've only tried this a couple of times.  It was another game that my friend had grown up with and loved, so it made its way to our game night.  While the concept seems really cool and it is something that could probably be a lot of fun I found that getting into it took quite some time.  Trying to learn and understand all of the rules slowed things down and using stock cars took a little bit of the fun out of it.

If a person took the time and invested in learning the game and how all the mechanics worked I'm sure it would be a great game.  It's just not that accessible for an older gamer with a family to learn. :-)

The problem with Car Wars is well known - mismatch with the theme and the game mechanics: Detailed, hard core rules for fast moving and firing cars just don't work. Mad Max -theme is done better in other games, don't bother trying this one. Got the deluxe edition at the age of 13 and with friends of mine we designed dozens of cars, but never actually finished a single race. There was more yawning and sighing than dice rolling.

In the early 80's this was a real obsession for my friends and I.  Speed, cars, and guns, with a wargame feel, and a RPG element in a pocket box! One of my first games after chess and I've been a hopeless gamer ever since!

I both love and hate Car Wars. For five years, we played this game frequently and really enjoyed it. But the growing list of weapons, accessories and engine options brought the game down, reducing it to a barely playable mess. The rules provoked long, ugly debates, even when we had a neutral referee, so we finally retired the game and haven't played it in more than a decade.

Good times back in the mid-80's! Great theme, fun battles. At that age, it didn't have the staying power of D&D, or Risk, etc. - probably because playing the game ended up being just a string of unconnected battles. But it was fun anyway! The different booklets with equipment and regional information were humorous and full of character.

I briefly played in a game where we all got into pseudo-character.  Not larping, more roleplaying, though we did dress up.  I was "JR Billy, of the Lansdowne Billies!" -- as in Hillbillies!  Wee!  Had a team crest and everything!  And a Slim Jim in my coverall pocket!

This was a cute game at the time, but I would never play it these days.  One I'm not going to give any credit for its age because it had very little that was new or innovative even then.  Just dumbed-down SFB (or Ogre, I guess, to be more accurate) on asphalt.

Another true classic from the early Steve Jackson ludography.  A lot of complicated fun; designing your cars is almost as much fun as fighting with them.  The new (5th) edition is just not all there; released before they were ready, in my opinion.  Looking forward to a 6th edition to get back to the basics of one of the most fun games to fiddle with when you aren't playing it...like creating characters for D&D and building the "perfect deck" for Magic.  Creates those game stories you remember for a long time.

A favorite from my high school days. Bonus points for being the origin of "Crash and Burn!" I recently played a fun game of this at Total Con.

My only gripe about this game system is that I wanted to stick with just the original game, whereas some of the others in my game group wanted to use every supplement and expansion available. Those are also the guys who wanted to spend an hour min-maxing the most powerful car design possible, while the rest of us just wanted to drive armed cars around and blow stuff up.

This is a little bit Star Fleet Battles, a little bit Battletech, and if you play with the miniatures rules, a little bit X-Wing. Except instead of space battles, it is postapocalyptic Mad Max style auto duels.

I also have the original deluxe version as well.  Love this game.  Would love a group to play it again some time.  Maybe one day.  (Will need to read the rules again, been a loooooonnnnnnnggggggg time.)

Bought when it was brand new, bought most of the expansions - but it's too fiddly for me now.

Played when I was a kid. Was way too slow moving for the topic it was attempting to 'simulate'.

This must hold the record for the biggest gap between theme and mechanics...I can think of no game with a theme so fast and exciting that plays so slowly and boringly.

I love this game, especially when using micro-machines scale miniatures, but it's difficult to get a non-hardcore pen & paper gamer into it. Haven't tried the new post 2000 editions yet.

(TRADE Interest: high) i have a personal fondness for car wars, but have trouble find people to play, because of all the fiddly stuff.

A little tarnished after 20 years, but a starkly important game for its day. I bought lots of Car Wars stuff during the 80s.

Still working on the rules for this one. Purchased it because of the retro box, the weird "turning key", and because I was at the time caught up in "Raid on St. Nazarie" and suddenly felt like I needed more "old school" games. With all those "extra" rules for getting out of your car and earning "points" to spend on other things from game to game, it feels more like a game "system" than a board game as we know it, but yet, that part of me that likes tedious bookkeeping remains fascinated

this, along with classic battletech and starfleet battles were my three go-to minatures games in my high school days...but I don't really do miniature gaming anymore

I just love Car Wars, unfortunately I only have one other friend who loves it as much as I do.

The classic Car Wars.  They should've stopped with this edition.

Cool if you like tabletop mayhem.  Fairly complex rules

- 1 plastic bag with (about 20) colored tokens : cars, trucks, motorcycles, RV ...

- 1 vehicle record sheet, 1 cycle record sheet
- 1 used vehicle planning sheet
- 1 stock vehicle shopping list

Good game that I spent alot of my school days playing. Creating cars was great, then spending all day playing 10 seconds worth of mayhem...
Looking back it now seems a bit flat....

RATING: 7
While this is definitely an old school game that requires a fair amount of book keeping and checking various tables, it is still the best game of its type and puts modern remakes to shame.  Half the fun is designing your own car and choosing weapons and defensive features before the fight even starts.  While the game can be played as a pseudo-RPG, it shines similar being a tactical skirmish.  Even though the game pace is a bit slow at times, you still can't beat shooting rockets and flamethrowers at your opponents cars.

It was great fun in 1981. Mad Max on steroids. You usually did not go very far before skidding of the road or just being blasted off it. Very much a period piece with incremental speed and lots of bookkeeping that was in vogue at the time.

Spent so much time with this game. Sadly it's too fiddly and the components aren't the best. If i ever get to play a campaign again i'm sure i will rate the game higher again but from a rational point of view it can't get a much higher rating.

Always had fun with this game! Really looking for a copy of the "Tanks" expansion.

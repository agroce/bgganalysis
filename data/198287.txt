Taken by suprise. I was aware of Andor, but never took it seriously. As a experienced mage knight player I thought the game couldn’t provide any fun for someone who’s enjoying heavy games. Maybe fun for kids i thought. But I was wrong as I ever could be. This game is a blast. Fantastic components abd immersive gameplay. I never care for flavortext, but it realy does a great job in this game. I am soloing it, and having tons of fun. Simple rulss but hard to beat. For this prics it’s a must have for anyond who care for coop/solo fantasy thened puzzlesolving advdnture.

Update: initial a lot of fun. But after a while its pretty repetitive. First couple of times when you play a legend its pure fun. But normally you will lose them if you want it to beat whitout making it easyer. Thats were the game dropps. Its just do the same thing over and over again. Its like laying out a complete puzzle but because you misser one part you just start over the hole way.

Just had fun with the intro. Much harder than Andor I. We had to use all our Andor experiences to finish in time.

Both sides of the board look a bit dull. I think the mountains setting on the main board was a mistake. You really have to get the perspective right if you want to counter the unexciting colours of mountains. Maybe that is too great a challenge considering that players have to move in these mountains like it is a broad country. Mountains do not look good from the aerial perspective.
I have a similar problem with the mordor-like landscape on the back of the board. There is not much interesting going on.  

The child-like narratives were never the strong part of Andor. But this time they are so badly written that it is difficult to delve into Menzel's world.       

Lastly, some new elements are just annoying. The fact that you have to feed your heroes every morning unless they are at the camp or the carriage? That takes away much of the freedom that the heroes had in the previous games, where they could just "do their own thing" apart from the group. The skeletons that move at their own time? More administration effort in a game that already has enough.

I DO like the new abilities. They are not only very useful, they contribute to the atmosphere of the game.

A couple legends in, and this does not disappoint. I love the "aged" heroes, expanded skills, and twists on the Andor formula. Menzel does not disappoint.

I can not understand the positive reviews of this new Andor box. First of all, I love the Andor system. I have the # 1, the # 2 and all the extensions. In spite of that this 3rd part displeases me strongly because it is too difficult. Even after 3 tries, I can not even win (and by far!) the introduction legend, while I won most legends of the other boxes in 1, 2 or 3 times max. Such a big level of difficulty why not for an extension, but this is a stand alone that a beginner in the game can buy as the first game in the series. He will then make a very big mistake because he will quickly be disgusted with the difficulty and will put his box deep inside his closet (which I will do myself although I'm not a beginner!). Here are the reasons why i don't like the game after my 3 experiments on legend 11:

1 - an avalanche of monsters. In addition they are all very close to the camp and the smallest ones advance 2 times per night! They are not super hard to fight but as it is essential to kill a lot so that the camp is not submerged, it makes advance the narrator at full speed on the track of time and prevents to devote properly to the missions.

2 - the stress of food is excessively strong and it makes lose a lot of will to the heroes. This is very disabling, especially to pass the ravine that is essential for the success of missions. I really do not like this new food system that I find really very painful.

3 - the luck factor is much stronger than in previous games. We can only survive the legend for a long time if we have a lot of luck in the positioning of the fog and cave tokens. They can very easily make the game even more unplayable if the good chips are too far from the heroes or worse if the bad ones are activated from the start.

In short, as far i find the difficulty is too high and makes the game unplayable in my case. I highly recommend to those who would like to discover the Andor system to NOT buy this game. It would be a pity that it makes them zap the first game opus which is a lot of fun and with a level of difficulty much more affordable and progressive. For those who don't think like me, don't hesitate to come visit my post in the forum where I talk about the difficulty of the legend 11, to explain me what I should do to stop me from losing in this damn introductory legend.

Finally got the English version. 
First impression is that it's much much harder than the red box. But harder is better! 
We won the introductory legend at the last second.
The tension was energetic! It felt like an actual achievement and thrilling adventure.
Waiting to hearing all the other mythical legends about Andor.

Epische Schlachten, tolle Veränderung von Burg zu Tross und sehr elegantes Spielbrett. Leider ist das gesamte Spiel inkl. Helden mit neuen Regeln und Fähigkeiten geradezu vollgequetscht, weshalb dieser Teil der Trilogie meines Erachtens mit Abstand der Schwächste ist. Schade!

A lot of cool stuff, but skeletons can be fiddly at times and there are no replayable legends like Legend 3, 9 or Star Shield.

Die Grundidee des Spiels ist nahezu gleich geblieben, allerdings enttäuscht Andor III als Nachfolger. Alle bisherigen Spiele haben mich in keinster Weise gefesselt. Dies liegt insbesondere an den vielen kleinen Zusatzregeln und Sonderbedingungen (z.B. Früchte sammeln etc). Das Spielfeld ist meiner Meinung nach auch zu verwinkelt und lässt wenig Raum für geeigentes Taktieren zu.

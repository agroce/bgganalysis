I was excited to get into the OCS system and always interested into the Burma theater but I found this game completely unenjoyable, it was a chore to play and I was put off by the tedium. Is it a simulation or a game? I don't know, but I do know I hate the CRT. The supply system is intriguing but too fiddly. If this were adapted to a computer game, I would probably play it but not as a board game, it's too complex and takes way too long to play, in my opinion it's neat to look at it but practically unplayable. I could see this appealing to retired, non-tech savvy vets or history buffs who have the time commitment, patience and interest.

This looks one of the more manageable OCS titles althoiugh there are lots of special rules due mainly to force size and the terrain that stand outside the usual system.

Preordered reprint from MMP. Arrived 6/8/08. Really keen to get this one on the table! The Japanese U-GO offensive is really a test of logistics between the two sides. Read the book 'Slim, master of war' by Robert Lyman to see the incredible complexity of the theatre and how Slim suckered the Japanese into an attritional series of battles.

Ouch. Plain OCS is already difficult to manage and the specificities of Burma makes it way much harder. Frankly, I do not believe for one second that OCS fits the PTO. If you don't like the basics of OCS (and I am clear about it: I don't!), Burma does not help the case at all.

OCS in a manageable package that does not need multiple table tennis tables to play. Japanese and Chindit ability to abuse the supply rules leads to tense manouver as break / re-establish supply lines. Just don't play if you love sweeping armor attacks, this is all about infantry ( and for the Allies - airpower)

RATING: 10
OCS is such a amazing system - it covers a very diverse set of campaigns without blinking. The Burma incarnation of OCS is fascinating, with supply being much more of a nightmare than in the other games. The air game, a definite weakness in the OCS games, is downplayed as the Japanese have essentially no air so this aspect doesn't get bogged down. The Japanese also are very unique, with less of a reliance on trace supply and a high but fragile AR. Burma is one of the best and most playable OCS titles on a fascinating campaign, and gets the highest recommendation from me. Another interesting comment, I see a comment below that OCS doesn't adapt to the PTO, but I disagree strongly. I had recently read Eric Beregerud's Touched by Fire and Tropic Lightning, and once I actually realised Burma *was* a simulation, and *applied* the lessons from reading these books rather than playing intuitively, my play improved dramatically. Not conclusive, I'll grant you, but it sold me.

OCS in a *very* different theater. I often hear it described as "OCS in the Pacific" but that's not quite right. The CBI theater (China-Burma-India) is better thought of as the prequel to Vietnam rather than an extension of the PTO. The IJA resemble the Viet Cong in that they're characterized primarily by superb light infantry that relies on infiltration tactics over direct combat. The Allies resemble the US forces of the Vietnam era in that they possess a lot of firepower with a correspondingly high logistical footprint, constraining their maneuverability in jungle and mountains. During Vietnam this relative lack of mobility was offset by air cavalry (helicopter-borne infantry) but in Burma the Allies relied on the Chindits; glider-borne special forces that specialized in prolonged operations deep in the jungle behind enemy lines.

In any case, the OCS system provides a superb platform for a game/simulation covering this theater of operations. Like most OCS titles, it's a steep learning curve even after you learn the rules. Both campaigns and scenarios are unforgiving of mistakes, especially of those made by the attacker. But for those willing to invest the time it's an unparalleled wargaming experience. It's also the only title in the series to offer airborne operations on a significant scale and one of the few titles *anywhere* that manages to capture the unique character of the IJA. Unlike a lot of titles that feature the Japanese, I found playing the Japanese every bit as compelling as the Allies.

In terms of how Burma stacks up to other titles in the series, I think it really comes down to personal preference. Those who enjoy OCS and have an interest in the CBI will no doubt enjoy Burma. It's a small title compared to other OCS titles; only two maps and low counter density. That will be an advantage for some but not for others. In terms of game play, the real difference is the emphasis on infiltration over combat. For example, there's no equivalent to Case Blue's dramatic panzer breakthroughs/deep drives. Burma features large numbers of smaller scale infiltrations that, hopefully, achieve the same result: knocking large enemy formations out of supply in order to displace them or starve them. It's every bit as difficult to accomplish and every bit as satisfying when you manage to pull it off. For me personally, Burma ranks topmost among OCS titles along with Korea.

Very different to the rest of the OCS stable, Burma challenges you with tough terrain and very limited supplies. While you're not going to be launching grand encirclements or surprise armoured assaults, you will be making your opponent's life difficult by flinging men into banzai attacks or dropping Chindits on lines of communication.

RATING: 5
Sold. OCS is cool in concept, but brutally slow to actually play.  Burma, due to the rough terrain and high Japanese AR's/low Japanese supply, is a game with very little attacking, and no rapid movement.  A creeping slow situation of infiltration and one hex maneuvers.  I like games with attacking and fast movement.

I was looking for a better explanation of how the Japanese could survive without good supply lines than a "forage table."  Why would they be better at living off the land than the Allies, who had native Indians and Burmese to help them?

Comments specific to OCS Burma

Review based on three plays of Imphal focused scenario and two of the Campaign.  I have also played scenarios from DAK II and Tunisia.

This is the best treatment of Burma I have gamed.  I love the way Japanese forces can infiltrate in the ZOC'less OCS environment.  There isn't much supply and airpower is muted by the terrain, so many of OCS' Achilles heels are less pervasive.  Still it would be a different game if aircraft cost more to refit.  Some aspects like the Chindits and the Burma road rarely function as they did historically.

I would play scenarios from this title again, but I'm not clamoring to do so.


Comments on the System

The Operational Combat System takes an interesting view of operational warfare, placing supply considerations in the fore, but the supply system is cumbersome and fraught with logical inconsistencies.  For me at least, OCS' marriage of wargame and pick-up-and-deliver game don't work.  The supply system requires too much session time, and despite occasionally adding an interesting dimension to play, it is not engaging enough to warrant the time it requires.  

I focus on the supply system, because one can't enjoy OCS unless they accept its treatment of supply.  There is much to like in OCS, I love the way it treats artillery bombardments, troop morale, and reserves for example.  I'm less enthusiastic about it's lack of ZOCs, and the power of aerial bombardments, but I am happy to live with them both.

Here are the specific issues I have with the supply system.

Consider that the distance across which a headquarters unit can deliver supply to their subordinate units never changes due to weather.  This is ahistorical in the extreme, particularly in the system's home theater, the East Front of WWII.  The rasputinia comes, the hard freeze, the heavy snows, the subzero temperatures ... nothing impacts the distance at which a headquarters can deliver supply.  Other operational systems handle the impact of weather on supply, and do it with some elegance.  i.e. it can be done and done elegantly.  In my mind, the impact of weather on supply is a necessary part of simulating many theaters.

Consider, supply is moved by trucks and other conveyances.  If you want to unload supply in OCS, you have to pay movement points.  Fair enough, movement points represent time spent idle while supply is unloaded from the transports ... but not always.  OCS has a huge loophole that allows trucks to drive through an area and "throw" supply to units, units which are not in the same hex or even adjacent.  Units which can be several hexes away ... and again regardless of weather.  The trucks continue moving after "throwing" supply in this way, without penalty.  Put another way, trucks that "throw" supply move the exact same amount as empty trucks or trucks that don't unload supply during their move.  Only trucks that explicitly unload supplies in a hex (and it has to be a hex with a unit or a  Port etc!) pay a penalty.  This is a logical disconnect that makes no sense to me.  It favors positioning and game play that again, are ahistorical and counterintuitive.

Consider, motorized units burn supply to move using their inherent transport.  Many can opt to move "on foot" without paying that supply.  They move at a slower rate which is logical.  Now let's say they do this for several turns and move beyond the maximum range of their transport (ie further than their single turn motorized MPs).  The next turn, you choose to supply them with fuel.  They a flipped over, and their trucks, which they left more than a turn's movement away, now magically appear in their hex, at no additional cost, and they can move at their maximum amount.  Again this is a logical disconnect.  Worse, in a system that markets itself as demanding realistic planning, this allows players a freedom that real commanders never enjoy.  

Granted the alternative is practically unplayable, but OCS pushes the treatment of supply to the limits of "playability" anyway.

Finally consider what exactly is supply.  It is ammunition, it is fuel, it is concrete and other fortification construction materials.

Now consider that you move some of this generic supply to a specific area.  In your mind, you are moving construction materials for use in building a fortification next turn.  Now I surprise you by attacking in that area, and you burn the supply as fuel so that your motorized forces can move in response to my attack.  They burn construction materials?!  So you just spent several minutes managing a generic supply system and at the very last second that supply can magically become anything you need it to be.  An ability which again, I imagine real commanders dream of possessing. 

It can be argued that these latter two aspects of the system are necessary abstractions for playability.  Fair enough, but realize that the supply system that they are part of *dominates* this system.  In a typical turn you will spent 30-100% of your time managing supply.  Entire turns will pass where you do nothing *but* move supply.  This makes for a fascinating challenge at times, but in my experience it more commonly results in a grinding monotony.  A monotony that leaves gamers like myself wondering was all this supply overhead worth the time?  Couldn't the same effects have been achieved without the rather crude approach of moving dozens of markers around the map?


Further, the OCS treatment of supply tends to detract from the fog-of-war that wargames hope to achieve.  I can see you moving and amassing supply in an area ... should I expect your offensive efforts to take place soon?  Should I expect them to take place out of range of the dumps you've gathered?  A whole game develops where one tries not to telegraph their intentions.  Whether one likes such games within their wargames is a matter of taste.  Honestly, it rather interesting at times, but too much of a headache at others.

Should I bombard those supply concentrations within range, hoping to disrupt your offensive, or to throw your ability to defend against mine into chaos ... sorry, you can't bombard supply anymore ... it's immune.  I'm interested in seeing how OCS treats the siege of Sevastopol for example, where supply dumps were important targets of initial bombardments.  In fact, bombarding enemy supply concentrations is fundamental to modern attack technique.  Again, OCS has banned it as it was deemed too gamey.

In closing, *all* the wargames I play make abstractions.  I appreciate wargames that take supply into consideration in an elegant way.  Spending a high percentage of my gaming session managing a supply system filled with loopholes, logical inconsistencies, and ahistoric results doesn't hold interest for me.  I gave OCS a second chance (having disliked v1.0).  I can't imagine giving it a third.

Sold all my games in the series.

Mmmm something like a mixed bag. I LOVE OCS but I feel is somewhat lost in the jungle, on air and armor and a lot of special rules makes this game something different from all other on the series.
Try and make me know. All in all, you have an hell of a time, trying to defend against those pesky japs. If on the other end you are directing imperial forces you'll fell an invincibility never felt with those panzers in russia.
IMHO Tunisia is the best of the lot when it boils down to "little " OCS. But try this one, It's a welcome change walking the   burmese hills.

This is probably the best OCS experience I have had to date, but I am unlikely to solo it again and any opponent I can convince to play it is likely to own it themselves, so sold.

Enjoying this. The supply situation is complex. You will have to master air drops, foraging, eating your SPs and defend your road network. Heavy rain can really mess with you. So whilst the OCS rules are not that tough, this game can easily catch you out. 

It is an interesting situation with the Japanese on both attack and defence in different areas. Lots of room of manoeuvres and infiltration of lines. Would probably play best with 4 for the main campaign, but has a good set of smaller scenarios too. Campaign turns take about 1 hour solo.

This is an extremely clever application of the OCS system to a situation that is completely different from the usual setting for this series---the European theater of operations.

Supply is extremely limited, and tanks and artillery serve purposes that are mainly ornamental.  It would not be completely out of line to claim that Burma is to the rest of OCS as Go is to Chess.

Got introduced to OCS Burma today. Played the introductory scenario twice an also got about halfway through one of the campaign scenarios before we called it because the game was already an obvious Japanese victory. It is a bit of a brainburner trying to find sollutions to the lack of supply and the logistic problems in the difficult terrain. I have lots and lots yet to learn about the game system but I really enjoyed it and would like to play it again. A great gaming experience.

Still in print (June 2012) - pick it up if you have any interest in OCS.  Along with Baltic Gap if you want to see some serious contrasts under the same rules.

The note is my impression of the beginning of the campaign. Wide variety of units, a number of fronts, with the possibility of attack against the two sides. Land that makes the supply lines are particularly difficult to maintain.
Burma appears to be very different from other game in the series, which is rather "refreshing".

Confirmation of interest in this game after a full campaign: a lot of tension on both sides. The Japanese army is an one shot army, while the allies can count on good firepower and aviation will be challenged.

Another great OCS game!

La note correspond à mon impression du début de campagne. Grande diversité des unités, plusieurs fronts, avec des possibilités de contre attaque des 2 côtés. Un terrain qui rend les lignes de ravitaillement particulièrement difficiles à maintenir.
Burma apparait comme un opus très différent des autres jeu de la série, ce qui est plutôt "rafraichissant".

Confirmation de l'intérêt de ce jeu après une campagne complète: beaucoup de tension des deux côtés. L'armée japonaise est une véritable armée à un coup, tandis que les alliés peuvent compter sur une bonne puissance de feu et une aviation qui aura fort à faire.

My favorite OCS game, for a couple different reasons. First, I find the historical campaign rather interesting. Second, the realities of the regional terrain creating a whole slew of challenging logistical problems. And third, the unit density makes the game so much more manageable than the big European games. My one strike against the game is maps and the sectors of action are such that the smaller scenarios have really weird map configurations (e.g., using half both maps) that can make them not have all that much smaller a footprint than the full campaign.

Good system covering a poorly covered aspect of WW2.  Components are good but nothing too special (map is great, counters are standard NATO icons).  The challenge of the game seems to be the Japanese army.  It must be used and dealt with like no other army in the OCS series (movement, supply, organization, and combat abilities are much different than Western forces).  Will force you to out move your opponent as the Japanese before you fight them.  Plays well, but the rules kept me from replaying.  They were the typical OCS rules, but with a thick game specific rule book with a heavy focus on supply (pack mules and elephants that can be eaten, etc...).

Game relies on movement and cutting of supply much more than other OCS titles.  Lots of infantry but not much armour, which is a reflection on the battles fought in this theatre of the war.

A little too heavy for me. In the absence of OCS Korea I bought this game to try the system just in case OCSKW became available and I could play it upon purchase. Having tried HARD to read the rules I can't get into the system. Personally not for me but I won't rate as it would be unfair to the game.

My usual love-hate with OCS, everything but map graphics and artillery system is amazing.  Artillery problems not so bad here, but map is a very hard to read.  Still, all in all a good game which I'm very happy to own and play.

OCS I don't know why people suggest this for newcomers to OCS. This requires wringing every tiny bit out of the system to be proficient. I'm not convinced that the three separate fronts interact as a campaign whole.

2nd ed. supply is too short; tanks and jp arty are useless. most scenarios start you off in a bad state of affairs- you battle the game as much as the opponent

A GREAT Addition to my OCS collection -a game about another Theatre. No Panzers. But the game is remarkably Fun and as challenging as any of the other OCS games. Quite Interesting trying to play the Japanese. No Supply, little artillery, very little armor; but Magnificent Infantry. Against a Modern Army. But the British and Commonwealth forces are also difficult to play. The Japanese have a ferocious ability to march rings around you, so your air supply is quite often needed. Add in the Chindits and "Merrill's Marauders" and you get an extremely fun and fascinating game !

Knew very little about the CBI before "Burma" -- the game drove me explore this fascinating "backwater" of WWII.  I think OCS held up very well in the "alien" terrain and combat environment of jungle Burma.

The terrain in this game is absolutely horrendous. These may be the worst possible conditions for offensive combat, which explains why there were so few frontal attacks in Burma. The Japanese are masters of infiltration, being able to remain combat effective when out of supply for long periods of time by foraging. Trucks, tanks, and wagons move hopelessly slow on anything but main roads. I've never appreciated the humble donkey as much as when I first played Burma, which has leg movement points and can easily handle both road and track.

There's a lot of subtle manoeuvring and tense stand–offs, whilst combat is rare. When it does occur it's usually a huge risk; in [b]Burma[/b] you have precious few supplies and troops given the frontage needed to be covered.

This game is really something special.  About my only criticism is many of the small scenarios still need both maps.  There is a huge amount of play in this.

My first OCS game. Took some time to learn the rules but it was well worth it. Need to play the campaign a second time with an opponent this time. Some of the scenarios are great aswell.

Bad weather, starving troops and horrible terrain.

The first OCS game I ever tried.  One solo play of the introductory scenario alone was enough to sell me on the system.

However, the unique character of the Japanese forces will take some adjustment to play correctly.

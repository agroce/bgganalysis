A cool little worker-placement game with many paths to victory.  The inability to change currencies was different, but not exciting.  The resolution of the arena and races felt a little awkward to me, and it was almost impossible to get money during the round.  You can plan a little ahead, but with only 30 moves, every move must be the right one.  Luck is not a huge factor here.  Good length.

Played this just once at Essen but it's an excellent worker player game with a LOT of interaction. In the style of many such games, areas are resolved one spot after the other. The twists come in the need to assure supplies of three currencies - gold, silver, brass - which are won in battles in the Colosseum/s and necessary for the construction of houses and winning of cards. Houses provide VPs but only if cards are held matching the areas in which the houses are constructed. Slave cards are also required to build certain buildings.
One particularly intriguing area of interaction is the auction spot for a single card per turn. Each player must raise a bid made by the previous player or pass, but since there are three currencies, all of which are visible, one must plan currrency use carefully to win an auction. So for example, if I bid 1 gold, you must bid one gold and one other e.g. one silver. The next player must bid one gold and one silver and add another coin. If he sees I have no brass, he could add brass and then I have to pass. Or if I have no silver left he can bid one silver. The player who "went" on the square gets the money from teh auction unless he wins it. Very nice.
Good visibility of each player's resources assure a medium level of complexity (not too much AP though) and a maximum of enjoyment. This, together with interaction both in battles (which are tense but short!) and the clever auction mechanism make this game a classic design. Very impressive. I just hope Zoch get the visibility they deserve.

First, the good point: it's rather nicely themed for a worker placement game.

Now, the bad points:
-it's a worker placement game that has degenerated into a luckfest
-the pastel colours are not the greatest and can be very hard to distinguish for the colour-blind, I believe (I am not colour-blind)
-it is far too short
-the rulebook is exceedingly vague at points

Overall, it really feels like this could have been a fantastic game, but what has been published is still in the prototype stage.

It feels like we've been here many times before; place workers to get resources (three varieties of currency plus slaves) to buy buildings to earn victory points.

Aquileia alleviates the boring, snowballing determinism by introducing a luck element (there are die rolls for this and that) and by having players compete in risky gladiatorial contests and horse races that offer decent rewards to their winners.  That isn't quite enough to raise this game above the profoundly average.

Aquileia isn't helped by artwork and components for which the word "functional" might have been invented.

it's a workerplacementgame with a portion of luck. For real strategy players, the luckfactor will be too high, for a familygame, the explanation is just too long. I think this game will fall in between, so there's no right public for it. Very strange that Zoch has published this game.

Standard fare worker placement game with some luck (dice rolling).
In our first game one player ran away with a "Portus" strategy, that could have only been blocked in a concentrated effort of all other players (with minimal gain). Although, this may be due to ou inexperience.

Completely out of place as a Zoch game, component-wise as well as gameplay-wise.

A competent worker placement game. Nothing new. Nice small amount of interaction between players at some of the actions. Multiple ways of scoring points. The dice can be a bit unnerving when actions and money are tight and the roll makes a difference. It would have been highly regarded 6 years ago.  But now it is just another worker placement game. 

Likes:1) small amounts of interaction between players at different action sites. 2) multiple things to do. 3) actions are tight

Dislikes: 1) dice that can throw things off 2) turn order is clockwise from the start player 3)it's yet another worker placement, collect some resources, convert to VPs

RATING: 7
A pretty standard worker placement game of trying to optimize your workers to eek out the most points by the end.  It seems there is a good trade-off here between scoring immediate points vs. also setting up an engine for game-end scoring, which offers some nice strategic decisions as to how you want to approach the game.

The twist that makes this game a real pain in the neck (which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned!) is that there are three types of currency which are tough to juggle, and you need the correct currencies to pay for things that you need.  The economy here is also very very tight, making that balance tough to strike.

There's also a good dose of luck here with some die rolling.  Sometimes, the wrong roll can actually be a pretty darn good swing in the game, but as in most games, your job is to mitigate that luck the best you can.

Overall, I thought it was a pretty enjoyable game.  Even though it lacked much originality, it still combined a bunch of familiar mechanisms into a good game.

Aquileia, the second most important city of the Roman Empire, had been originally founded as an outpost against the Barbarian invaders.Players want to become the most powerful figure in the city by trading and building. Each player, representing a wealthy Aquileian patrician, owns a certain number of henchmen (pawns) which he uses for these main activities: sports playing, culture, trading, and building. Each activity can bring expenses, earnings and sometimes victory points (VPs).

Played in the same long weekend as Trajan, and this game just seemed more enjoyable and more "Roman" flavoured.  Bidding element may not be to everyone's taste, and the dice rolling adds luck.  That said, the time playing this passed quickly.  Much more of a gamers game from Zoch than one might expect given their normal track record of "family" games.

A worker placement game that relies heavily on dice rolls when actions are resolved. Coupled with bland artwork, unimaginative themeing and lots of ho-hum actions that you don't actually want to choose but have to because, well, your workers must go somewhere after all (probably less of an issue with less than 5 players, but still) it's not a particularly great implementation. Pretty much only recommended for players who want their worker placement spiced up with ultra-simple dice-based arena fights.

Die künstlich wirkende, pastellfarbene Gestaltung im 80er Jahre Goldsieber-Look "Hässliches Entlein" tut in seiner unfreiwilligen Grottigkeit dem Auge auf naive Weise wohl.

Very good game, fairly simple roman themed worker placement but it runs much better than other similar games

Edit: with hindsight I rarely find myself wanting to play this.

You basically pick one strategy from the start and then hammer that as efficiently as possible throughout, if 2/3 players pick the same strategy you probably all lose... pick something different and you're good!

Fun value = meh

Replayed it 3 years later. Conclusion; it's terrible with 3. I'd love to play it with the maximum 5 though as I think then it would suddenly have that competition it requires

Unimaginative standard worker placement with high dice gambling luck. A perfect example of a game where gambling and WP aspects don't glue well together to form a good game. On top of that: bland pastel art, loss of tightness in a three or four player game and an unthematic rule that stops you from interchanging copper with silver and gold for payments, all make this game a rather mediocre game at best.

Couple of interesting ideas (especially how you use different kind of currencies), and many well-known and used game mechanics. This mix works nicely, but the length ruins the experience. We have a fast game group and we can finish easily whole game in a time, which is printed on the box, but this kind of game should be shorter and faster. Because now I don't see any time or place where I would choose this instead of many other games.

Ancient Rome. Your time is divided between the theater, the forum, the arena, the port. You'll have to carefully manage your actions in different areas. Trajan, you're thinking? Maybe, but imagine the game is actually fun and interesting. 

Aquileia is, in a lot of ways a pretty standard euro, except it has a lot of neat things going on. Worker placement where one worker is only used for turn order. An arena/horse race that is a lot more important than it first appears. Scoring buildings requires a coin, which can be stolen. A friendly looking light euro that can get pretty tense and cutthroat.

Pretty standard worker placement game; the twist is the amount of luck that comes into play from rolling dice, which tilts it slightly to the party/strategy genre. There is some excitement when a good dice roll propels you from last to first place in the arena, for example. Nicely constrained 6-round structure. I've read that with 3, the game feels too wide open; the 4er I played was great for teaching but still felt a little open. I would play it again because it goes quickly and is entertaining enough, but I don't know that it'll yield further charms on subsequent plays.

This game has serious identity issues: Tries to pose as a gamer's game by using a series of thematically unconnected worker placement areas, but ruins everything by dealing out money through completely arbitrary dice rolls.

RATING: 6.5
Peculiar blend of worker placement and a relatively straight economy that uses three currencies that aren't readily interchangeable. I would have liked to see a little less luck in the dice rolling (perhaps some sort of compensation element needs to be there?), and there is potentially a runaway leader problem as a consequence. But there are also a lot of good mini-games here, and the art is unusual but striking. I love the idea of the tiebreaker being part of the worker placement, and the multiplicative scoring is also innovative.

Si apprezza molto di più dopo le prime partite perciò ho rivisto il mio voto decisamente in positivo.
Le meccaniche non sono mai scontate e l'interazione tra giocatori è elevata: già alla seconda partita i tempi si fanno molto più veloci e serrati. In 5 giocatori si complica un po' la situazione e a maggior ragione le strategie devono essere ben delineate e calibrate. 

Molto divertente insomma!

I liked it a lot. A must-have for Ancient Rome lovers. Good interaction between players and good mechanics too.

RATING: N/A
I like worker placement and I like point-scoring engines, but this one didn't quite click. In part our first play was skewed by the difficulties in figuring out what was most valuable (chariot races!), and early mistakes/poor investments are pretty difficult to overcome.

I think the bigger issue is that for such a tight economic system, with such carefully integrated interlocking mechanisms, the luck is too big a factor: card draws for the theatrum and mercatus can in particular thwart careful plans a bit; but in particular particularly lucky dice rolls for the circus and the arena (and the latro) basically usurp all strategy once in a while.

I'm not typically averse to luck in such games, but given the limited choices (based on coinage) available, and the investment needed for each choice, having one's plans disrupted by a dice roll or two each turn felt obnoxious.

Really enjoyed my first play.  Worker placement games are tending toward collections of internal "mini-games" (Manhattan Project comes to mind) and this is a great example -- lighter than Vinhos (to use a recent point of reference for me) but the mini-games themselves (particularly the competitions) are more ingenious.  Nicely weighted between heavy and light.

Jogo interessante, que se revela longo pelo tempo que demora e ao mesmo tempo curto na experiência de jogo, pois parece que acaba cedo de mais... É um worker placement muito diversificado e que vai passeando pelo mapa de Aquileia, uma referência do império Romano. Diria que é uma mistura de "Stone Age" (na mecânica e a união de cartas e dados), com "Manila" (na sorte que determina a riqueza) e "Fortuna" (na temática e sentimento geral do jogo), que com cores mais vivas, arte mais apelativa e uns componentes melhores teria alcançado outros patamares.

On itself, I find this to be a smooth running worker placement game, but it does not really add anything to the genre. The layout of the artwork may be very functional, it is a bit to 'sterile' to add to the theme. Probably my judgment is also clouded by the fact that Trajan came out in the same year, providing a far better and deeper game trip to Roman Empire.

1 play, and we got most of the rules right! And the rules that were wrong ... we may like better than the rules as written!

--- Summary ---
It's a worker placement game with a Roman theme. The board shows 6 numbered areas, each with a different number of worker spots. In turn order, players place one of their workers OR their turn order marker in a location (or the turn track). After all workers/turn order markers placed, resolve the areas in order. These areas allow you to:
1. roll dice to earn money (which comes in 3 colors); convert money and earn 4VP; buy cards to help inn the coliseum or arena
2. buy slaves (useful for certain building areas; also may help in the arena -- we forgot this rule, too!)
3. collect 4 dice to help later in arena and/or coliseum
4. arena: players get a baseline +1 or +2 for their worker(s), then may commit additional cards and/or dice. Finally, players roll more dice (we accidentally omitted this part ... probably for the better!); in descending order of final sums, award 1st/2nd/3rd place bronze coins, with first place also getting either VP or a card.
5. coliseum: workers were committed to either silver or gold spots. Otherwise, resolve like the arena (with cards and dice). Ranks 1/2/3 will collect silver or gold, depending on where the workers are; again, 1st place may bet VP or card.
6. theater: auction off an end-game VP multiplier card
7. score buildings in the beige zone; a thief may be able to rob money from the other workers here
8. build 1-2 buildings, and possibly score VP, depending on which specific worker spot was occupied

The game ends after 6 rounds. End game VP come from board positions in each of several areas multiplied by the number of matching VP cards. Highest total VP wins.

Strong sense that shows it's best with the maximum I.e. Exactly 5. With 4 felt the worker placement decisions not quite as tough as I'd like. The currencies and dice battles work well and distinguish this (a little) from other WP euros...but not by enough to make it interesting enough to keep.

The production could have been a little less beige, a not terrible attempt from Zoch to do some thing outside their normal sphere, however the should stick to what they do well - fun games

A very nice game, that was easy to understand. The dices used gave the game a twist, without destroying the game. The dice were not to powerful. The one thing that i didnt like with this game was that there was only 3 opportunities to get a lot of points in the end of the game. If you were sitting as number 5 and then 4 in the last two rounds because the startplayer moves to the left, it is almost impossible to get to this spots because they are taken of the 3 first player, especially the last 2-3 rounds. Its possible that gets better in a 3 or 4 player game, but not in a 5 player...

I'm enjoying this quite a bit in the early going and have logged a number of plays very quickly. I love that every placement involves making tough choices, and that you never have enough actions or strength to do everything you'd like in a round. There certainly seems to be many paths to victory, but watch out for letting one person max out the district score multipliers ... a game can quickly get out of hand that way. The theme works well enough and the game seems well balanced. Rating may even go up in the future ... Aquileia is definitely carving out space in my play rotation.

Aquileia (and I've no idea still how to pronounce that) is a worker placement game set in Rome. In the game you're mostly doing three things, building houses, fighting in the Colosseum or racing horses. Most of the other actions (getting money, getting slaves, getting cards, etc.) augment your ability to do those three things.

Money is a funny thing in this game. For whatever reason there's only one moneychanger in town and he's monopolized by Matt. If you need to spend a bronze coin to do something and you don't have it, tough luck son. Even though there's an official exchange rate between gold, silver and bronze, where both silver and gold are worth more than bronze, vendors are sticklers for you having exact change. No matter how much you insist paying gold for bronze is a great deal, they just won't do it.

Building houses in this game is one of the two main ways to score points. There's two types of houses you can build. There's the non-colored houses that you can trigger/score during the game and there's the colored houses that only score at game end. The non-colored houses only trigger/score (I differentiate between trigger and score points because some of them pay you money instead of scoring points) if you specifically take an action to make them do so... which costs money. There's also only three spots where people can trigger the non-colored houses so it could potentially be a contest to get those spots. (Part of the reason I did so well in this game is that not enough people competed for those spots and I was able to trigger my houses every round.)

There's also the colored houses which only score points at the end of the game... but only if you have matching cards of that color. The downside is that getting cards is hard, the upside is that a single build action could pay you back multiple times if you get multiple cards of that building color. There's also higher point houses in some of the colors than in the non-colored areas.

All the buildings have a cost which is either coins, slaves or some combination thereof. There's five actions spots to build houses. Two of them allow you to score the house you're building immediately (in addition to whenever else it might score) and one of them allows you to double build.

The second main way to get points is to fight in the Colosseum. Only three players can compete here. The first player in gets 2 fight points, and the other two players get 1 fight point. In turn order, when this area is resolved, players first roll three dice to try and get additional fight points. Then, in turn order again, players may commit slaves and equipment cards to boost their fight strength. Finally, if the player took the potentia action spot is in the Colosseum they can choose to use 0-4 of their potentia dice to try and augment their military points (the potentia dice must be split between the Colosseum and the horse race). The winners get 3 bronze, 2 bronze and 1 bronze respectively. The first place winner has a choice of either taking victory points equal to his fight points x 2 or taking a slave card. The second place player gets what he didn't choose.

The horse races are one of the two ways to get the colored cards. There's 6 action spots in the horse race. Three of them commit you to gold, and three commit you to silver. The race resolves pretty much the same way as the Colosseum except that you can't commit slaves to the race, and instead of equipment cards you play horse cards (in the correct color). Winners take 3, 2 and 1 of whatever color coin they entered as. The winning player takes the public color card and the next one face down and chooses to keep one, gifting the other to the second place player.

There's a third color card available each round which is decided by an auction. You don't see which color this card will be until the auction starts. The person who went to this spot starts the auction. Every player must match the previous bid and increase it by a coin or drop out. This makes for some interesting "Who has silver coins?" situations where people can force other players out of the auction by bidding coins other player's are short on.

There's also a market to buy horse/equipment cards, a market to buy slaves, a way to make change between currencies (and get 4 points), a way to get 2 random coins, and a few other options.

The game is interesting. It felt a little bit like Tribune to me, but probably only a bit superficially. There's a fair bit of dice rolling, but it didn't feel very random. Occasionally someone would roll nothing, or get really lucky and roll everything, but almost always the results ended up being predictable and when the rolling dice dust settled, the person who looked to be winning before dice came out ended up winning after the dice did their damage. There's definitely some interesting decisions to be made. In my initial play, few people competed for the non-colored buildings, so it was easy for me to get a lot of points that way. The colored houses didn't seem as potent, but I think if more people had been trying to score the non-colored houses that the balance would have been a bit better. I'm eager to try it again and see if it plays out differently.

Provisional rating, one play (unfinished) at Spiel.  Not for me.  Worker placement, turning resources into points, with a little bit of dice luck in the arena/stadium.

Another worker placement Rome themed game.  Sure, why not.  But it's still only a "solid 7" Euro medium weight game play, with nice production value.

A fun addition to the Worker Placement genre.  The competition for resources at the Arena and Stadium add a layer to the game that makes it interesting.

Nothing particularly new but a fun game.

Een aardige workerplacement, met redelijk wat directe interactie.

Spelers bouwen de stad aquileia op. Maar dat niet alleen, ze strijden ook in de arena en de paardenrennen voor eeuwige glorie en geld.

Jammergenoeg nog niet kunnen afspelen, zou ik nog wel een keer willen doen.

I liked the interaction in this worker placement game. There are dice but I thought the randomness was a good thing. A little complicated for a family game and very much like lots of other euro games but enjoyable. I say try it.

Not fun!
Confusing rather than interactive and with luck in the wrong places. I will be trading or selling.

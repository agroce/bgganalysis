From the Reviews:6 is a great rating considering the number of people involved. I like the theme and the tedious detail management. With so other players who feel the same way I think this would be a great experience with so many friends. But this game does seem to be suited to online play so that things could work smoother.

A great game. Best played with a large group of people and large numbers of ships. Still good with small groups but you need to pick the scenario well else it can be a poor experience. I've had some of the best gaming experiences playing this game, I've also had some of the worst. It all comes down to scenario choice and ship allocation.

Wonderfully evocative Age of Sail game. Each player takes just one or two ships, plots movement simultaneously, quite a bit of detail and it feels fairly 'realistic'. I like it a lot, although the production values (e.g. the photocopies rulebook and charts) let it down a little.

Both a fantastic simulation of naval combat during the era and a well-designed game.  Plays smoothly enough to be enjoyable, but with enough 'important' decisions to be a good, challenging wargame.  Looking forward to trying the multi-player systems (ie signaling).

RATING: 8
Very similar to Wooden Ships and Iron Men.  I love this period.  While WS&IM is designed to be a 2 player game, Close acton is designed to be primarily a 4+ player game.  So it's WS&IM with chrome.  The manuevering is simple, the extra chrome is primarily with the damage and boarding aspects.  

With this game each player controlling a small number of ships is the ideal way to go, otherwise the game would slow down too much.  This game shines with the multi-player, for a two player game I'd prefer the slimper WS&IM.

Because of the details in the combat it may slow down a bit more than it needs to.  If you've played the game enough, I imagine that it will play 2-3 times faster.  On the other hand, there aren't that many wargames that play well with 6.  This is one of the older style games, so it may be too fiddly for some, particularly those to play a lot of euros.

Plays well with 3-6  Even # players is better.

Plays well with 6

The spiritual successor to Avalon Hill's "Wooden Ships and Iron Men", Close Action shares some of AH's vintage mechanics, but is meticulously well-researched and generates much more historically accurate results without bogging down play.

Close Action is my favorite system for Age of Sail minis. Getting rid of the hex grid for movement and fire is pretty easy, but there is also a great set of player-generated rules for converting facings from 6 to 12 using hex vertices in addition to sides. This makes for much more challenging and interesting sailing and battle tactics!

Between the core box and two expansion books, there are dozens of scenarios available spanning the globe during the American Revolution and Napoleonic Wars.

Hey, I love the age of sail, and this is the game for it (as long as it's only one person/ship). Takes a bit to re-learn and play every time I get around to it.

RATING: 6
Good tactical simulation of 19th century naval warfare. The rules are tight, and anyone coming from [i]Wooden Ships and Iron Men[/i] will have no problem digesting them.

Unlike WSIM this game does not degenerate into massed boarding actions, and running into other ships carries a substantial penalty. The greater tactical detail does limit you to controlling about 2 or 3 ships max per player, but large scenarios are still possible with enough players.

As for complaints, the lack of impulsed movement (unless played as an optional rule) can lead to some issues as far as missed firing opportunities and unlikely rams whether accidental or friendly. I also miss the double/chain/grape shot from WSIM.

Update: After a long hiatus between plays and a period where I almost sold/traded the game, I was reminded why. I'm just not buying those movement and collision rules, where the collisions can be decisively bad. While they did happen historically, they were quite rare in practice, and here they are largely an artifact of the jigsaw movement system and overly coarse 60 degree turns more than anything else.  The net result is that getting your opponent to ram into you accidentally-on-purpose [i]Devil's Run[/i] style  is a real tactic because being stopped for a bow rake wasn't enough punishment. And apparently a collision magically eliminates forward momentum for not just one but BOTH ships. Emergency deceleration, captain! Or something, nevermind those pesky laws of physics.

The fan-made 30 degree turn rules mitigate the collision issue somewhat since ships can then squeeze past each other a bit more easily, but overall I think miniatures systems such as [i]Sails of Glory[/i] are better with their movement templates. Plus, the critical hit system was pretty clearly designed with SOL's in mind, and doesn't "scale down" properly for smaller ships. To top it all off, the majority of scenarios are simply unplayable unless you have a large club of dedicated players.

At the end of the day I think I'd rather just play SFB if I'm in the mood for a hex & counter mark-off-the-boxes type naval game since it has so many more interesting choices. But, for now I'm going to hold onto it, mostly because it's easy to house-rule the nonsense away, and because I enjoy reading the historical notes for the scenarios.

A mind-blowing game of simultaneous action focusing on ship duels and small squadron engagements. Lots of micromanagement and book-keeping involved, but the result is a compelling and elaborate picture of war at sea in the Age of Sail.

RATING: 8
Exceptional wargame on the age of sail. Fast, simple plotted movement system. The trick is paying attention to your wind facing and sail state. But more importnat is anticipating the positions of you and your targets. Great fun, can't wait to play more and also to do a fleet battle using the rules for signalling between ships. 
 
My only gripe with the system is some of the complexity in the movement rules when you change facing, and how that can affect your speed. A lot of text is devoted to ironing out all cases rather than a robust simpler solution.

RATING: 8
A Napoleonic naval game that owes much of its feel to Wooden Ships & Iron Men.  That said, it is a more detailed simulation which works well down to single frigate actions, with Captains having to worry about sail settings and crew activities; i.e. managing your resources best to outmaneuver and outfight the enemy.  The next level at which this gives a superior game is in multiplayer actions, where we have had considerable fun, with signals flying and squadron maneuvers going horribly wrong for the unwary, it's a brave officer who takes his ship out of the line to chase down a perceived opportunity.  Overall, it gives a good fun game that makes you feel like you are fighting a sailing ship of the line, rather than just pusing a cardboard counter around.  As ever, I dream of replacing the counters with models and thereby enhancing the visual as well as the game playing aspect.  It will take a lot before I put this one aside in favour of another Napoleonic naval game.

Created as an update/correction of Wooden Ships & Iron Men, this game properly reduces the degree of boarding combat, but plays quickly and easily.  The system of flag orders is simple, but makes this a thinking-man's game as the "Admiral" must anticipate conditions a turn ahead even as his orders are executed by his captains a turn behind.  The most important thing for players to learn is how to maneuver in line-ahead without piling into their next ahead on turns.

The most detailed sailing ship game available.  For 2 players, single ship or small squadron actions are best; the larger fleet actions are impossible to get through in a timely manner and can only be realistically done via team play. Even with the detail, the game feels intuitive and it's easy to teach just enough to get new players into the game (more rules layers can be applied during play).  As of this writing, there are two scenario supplement books and so there's tons of situations to replicate.  Very highly recommended, especially if you were every frustrated by the artificialities of WOODEN SHIPS & IRON MEN.

The lack of rules online make this a hard sell. I looked at it for a long time trying to decide whether it is a game I would ever play. Rumors of its ridiculous complexity scared me off. Eventually I got it via a Maths Trade (that way wouldn't I wouldn't feel obligated to play it since I hadn't technically bought it).

The upside: the complexity is vastly overstated. 90% of the complexity is for stuff that should never happen: boarding actions, marine gunfire, grappling, fire spreading across ships, ship explosion radius, anchoring, towing, etc. Simultaneous movement resolution when ships are entering the same hex is the hardest bit but a) it didn't come up in my play and b) it LOOKED fairly procedural.

The downside: this is really a multiplayer wargame. The scenario book is somewhat limited but it has a "random scenario generator" of sorts. Well, more like a Warhammer 40k "each side get 1,000 points to buy a fleet" scenario generator. I don't think a single person could reasonably control more than 2 or 3 ships. Which means if you've got 2 people you're looking at 4 ships fighting. The designer has said that single ship action is "uninteresting" and not really what the game is designed for. So you really need 4 players. At least.

On the positive side of the downside (!) I get the feeling this would be a superior multiplayer wargame in large part because the simultaneous plotting and resolution removes the hideous downtime that kills my enjoyment of games like Here I Stand.

Can be great fun for a certain mindset, or if Mark Campbell or Al Parker are running the game.  Truly for the detail oriented.  CA adds detail and authenticity lacking in its close cousin, Wooden Ships and Iron Men.  However, something goes missing in the all the paperwork... it's more plodding and less free-wheeling than WS&IM, and therefore perhaps not as exciting as a game.  Damn fine simulation, by Neptune!

Can't remember enough about my play to give a detailed commentary--it was awhile ago.  But with one person running the show it was easy to pick up and tons of fun.  I loved the fact that your team members' actions are performed in semi secret. They can give you signals, but these can be misinterpreted...so there's always the potential for a very entertaining clusterf*ck.

This game also made me realize that I like to shoot things with cannons.

I used to play the original miniatures version of "Close Action" at tournaments in the late 80's and early 90s. A definite improvement from the old Avalon Hill Wooden Ships & Iron Men. I haven't played the boxed version yet but the rules are almost identical to the old tournament verisons.

This game really shines in large multiplayer games.  Fleet actions with up to 10-20 players on a side, each commanding a single ship, are this game's sweet spot.  Fortunately I live near the designer who occasionally organizes such games.  Teamwork and command and control are the keys to success (the game's rules for limiting communication between players really make the game).

Close Action is the naval battle game on the pre- and Napoleonic era.  Although not a solitaire-friendly game, there is a lot of scenarios to choose from, always a strength of this kind of game.  But then how much time you can afford to play each and every own?  And if you can't play them all, the suplus value always go to the publisher...(choke!) The game is well received by the wargamers and naval enthusiasts and is currently top game from the publisher.  Very nice...naval warfare, always something of desire (because of its high simulation value) but never played out as frequent as I would have wanted to (because of the very low counter density and extremly individualistic when commanding and team efforts required on the other hand. Here is what a fellow wargamer commented: Close Action is to Star Fleet Battles as Flying Colors is to Full Thrust.  I feel a bit daunted by its complexity level.

The pinnacle of historically accurate sailing ship games. Started out as an attempt to "fix" Wooden Ships and Iron Men and it shows. Especially in multiplayer games this is a great system.

Unfortunately, this comes at a price. Complexity is high, dierolling is high (resolving a single fire requires 2-3 dice, three more if you get a critical hit, then another for some critical hits, then morale checks, rigging checks, etc.  As a result, for large actions, WSIM or Simcan's Man of War must remain the games of choice (I'm not touching Flying Colors with a stick; its activation mechanisms simply don't work to reproduce fleet behavior.)

This is my second favorite of all games I own or play. This is an outstanding simulation of naval combat in the Age of Sail. The level of detail is rich without being overwhelming. Doesn't play large battles with few players (I'm sure the big multi player games are awesome!) like Flying Colors, but to me the detailed command of the ship is more interesting and challenging.

The ultimate in Napoleonic naval games.  Excellent rules and beautiful but generic counters, nice plain blue maps. Everything you ever wanted in an Age of Sail game, but at a huge cost in playability.  Plotted movement and separate logs for each ship mean that this game is best handled at 1 or 2 ships per player, with larger battles such as Trafalgar almost out of the question.  Signaling rules are a must for players familiar with the basics.  Larger battles are best handled using Flying Colors or with a REALLY large group.

Excellent ship-to-ship combat game that puts you in the role of Captain (vice Admiral or Commodore). Rules look intimidating, but once you get the ship logs filled in, the game flows well. Love that fire combat resolution is on a single chart and that critical hits are well designed. Both are dramatic improvements over Wooden Ships and Iron Men, though there are similarities between the games.

Great scenarios in the base game and both expansions are loaded with tense, historical engagements. To get to the larger ones, you need multiple players, making this perfect for convention play. The ship counters and maps are nicely done, and the game is very satisfying.

My favorite Age of Fghting Sail game.  I own the Clash of Arms edition.  Can be used for miniatures or with counters.  More refined than Wooden Ships & Iron Men, the refinement comes at the cost of a bit more complexity.  High replay value.

A hardcore simulation wargame. Better played it with lots of people (the more, the better), each one with a ship. Absolutely a fantastic war sailing simulator game!!

The first couple times I played this I really enjoyed it, but with subsequent plays I've found my enthusiasm waning. It may be a very good simulation, but I just don't feel like I get to make very many interesting decisions over the course of a game. It's also slow, and so I find my fun per unit time to be rather low.

Astonishingly good fun. It's approaching the holy grail: Detailed, but playable; serious, but a laughfest. Take the designer at his word and play one ship per player (at least at first.) And use the signalling rules - they make the game. And as if that were not enough, there's the prospect of ongoing retail pleasure - expansion packs, and for the tactile, replace your ship counters with 1/2400 minis

RATING: 5
Somewhat reminiscent of Star Fleet Battles in scope and complexity, but substituting plotted movement and sail management for impulse movement and energy allocation.  More a battle of attrition than I expected, and crew quality is of appropriately enormous importance.  I'm not a huge fan of the Age of Sail, but I was impressed with how the system played out.  The basic system is pretty straightforward for a wargame, but there are a lot of odd bits and corner cases which balloon the rulebook to mindboggling proportions.  I could be enticed to play again, especially with multiple players per side using the limited communication "signalling" rules.

Probably the best mass-multiplayer title there is, in fact, the more players the better!
Now - to find all those other players.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] This the Fighting Sail game we seem to have settled on. Only played one 4p (2v2) game so far, but we all enjoyed it after getting the hang of the rules.

Close Action is pretty much the ideal fighting sail simulation game. The rules initially appear to be very dense, but are really easily handled in play and it suffices if only one player knows the more complex rules such as e.g. line of sight, because all actions are resolved simultaneously, so rule questions the players might have can be answered all at the same time.

The game is very fun with many players, i.e. four or more, because without good teamwork or communication ships from one side might for example run into each other or block each other from shooting. The recent 2004 Clash of Arms edition also features incredible graphics and looks great in play even without miniatures.

This is a game I make time to play; it needs a revamp on play aids and forms.  Like a lot of Big Sim games, it requires a certain mindset.  Having the game designer there when it's being run helps as well.

Some of the mechanisms for showing teamwork and command span are in the "big bucket of ideas" for my fleet level wargames.

The rules are somewhat complex, but less so than other comparable games. It's worth the investment, though. The game is incredible; you feel the the breeze in the sails, the triumph of roundshot striking home, and the anguish of your lovely ship being abused by the enemy. When I play Close Action I feel as if I am "Lucky" Jack Aubry, directing my men to beat to quarters.

How to get real value out of a large collection of PotSM ships? Play a miniatures wargame set in the Age of Sail! I ebayed this for $5. I won big time on that purchase . 

Not to be confused with Signal:Close Action, the miniatures rules published by Age of Sail grognard Rod Langton.

Played this one a lot with my friends back in the late 90s. It made me understand naval warfare in the age of sail like no book had. Many fond memories.

Overwrought rules that don't really add much to the game except playing time.

A bit better than Wooden Ships & Iron Men, but still required a bit more work than I was looking for.

I'm really not that keen on game systems that require you to be a Subject Matter Expert before you can play them.

Somewhat complex but fairly logical. Very immersive, if you are into the period. I didn't play it enough to rate it, and more importantly I didn't play it the way it is meant to be played, with several players on each side.

This game really shines with many ships in the engagement!  Small battles aren't as exciting, because ships can soak up tons of dammage before striking, so it doesn't have the thrill of a clear victory.

Excellent naval game if one person controls only one ship (max two) at the time and tactics are not spoken loud but used signaling rules instead. Great fun with multiple people, very involving.

Fantastic game. It plays easily and well, although the small nuances can get you if you don't read the rules thoroughly. Box open to play time was quick. Bringing new players into the game takes about 10 minutes of instruction. Definitely best at the suggested ratio of 1 player to ship, although 2 ships per player isn't too bad for small scenarios.

Have yet to play. Got some 1/3000 minis and am paitning these up. The rulesa re pretty straight forward but relatively complex due to the nature of the wind and how this relates to movement. Lots of scenarios and looks great.

Just played my first game. Very good. Nice and tense with lots of fun but just enough detail to make it interesting. Recommended.

... my ships are being painted in the docks at present... look lovely! :)

Painted and played a number of times now. Great game and feels like sailing!  We regularly get 3-6 players together for a nice fight.

I like this one a lot.

Mark designed this as an improved WSIM (and I remember his complaints about WSIM from an early campaign he ran).  It took him several tries, but I think he got this right.  Much more flavor than WSIM; more reality and not much less playable (but then, I like complex games).

I prefer the original Tempest Games version to the Clash of Arms version as it is a bit simpler and gameplay flows better. 

For miniatures this is the best looking naval era.

The rules are a bit technical but not as hard as word would them be. All maths take place before the setup of the game, but once started, it is just plain fun. I am using Langton miniatures, which give a new dimension to the table.
My first non-solo experience comes from an internet game and it is very useful to catch any subtlety in the movement or firing rules. It proves me that the game should be a lot of fun face-to-face.
Complexity is not a word I would chose over detail, if I were to sum up the rules. They are worth every page of the handbook.

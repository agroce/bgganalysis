If you are familiar with the State of Siege games ... this ain't one of them.  The influence is there, but you don't have all the tracks pushing toward the middle.  This is like an elaborate game of clue and when you think you have solved the case, you go to trial and play out the trial.  It's a novel design.

Every time I think there's a game on everything, I'm proven wrong.  Very curious to see this one when it comes out.  (Of course there aren't games on everything--but I'm pleased to see a serious historical game on a non-war subject.)

Really nice little solitaire game. I love the history behind it, and the gameplay is interesting and not too complex. Rules could be clearer and may need a minor  tweak, and I wish it had a 2-player variant, but I was still intrigued after three plays. After about seven, however, it was played out and I sold the game.

RATING: 8
I have realised why I am enjoying this more now then when I started. I began by viewing this as a deduction game, but I either get all the Conspirator cards or get steamrollered really fast. So now I view the game as a thriller, to see whether I can catch Burr before he can achieve his plans. It helps that I somehow get either Treason or Innocent motives more than Filibusters. Planned coups are very personal and have drawn me into the narrative element of the game. That and it feels more like I am stopping Wilkinson, my supposed helper, rather than Burr.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: This card driven solitaire gives the player many choices and decisions, adding extra dimensions to a typical States of Siege game. There's alot happening and the player's choices are directly responsible for the tempo of the game. The theme is unique and there's an overall "whodunnit" feel to the game. If you don't watch out, you may actually learn something about the history behind the events related to Jefferson and Aaron Burr.

after 8 plays

---

Played it three times (one aborted) during the first evening and wanted to play it first thing the next day.

A good game, has that "want to do six things but can only afford 1" tension, a ticking clock, and a mystery to solve.  In the end you have to go with your gut and risk it all.

In eight games, I have seen significantly different outcomes.  I have learned the cards, and developed my own style.  I never pay to reshuffle the deck for example.  I put four agents in the West, and riots be damn.

I like the game and have already gotten my money's worth of enjoyment out of it.

One oddity is the victory conditions, the VP value of successfully prosecuting Burr for exactly his crime is low if the "value" of the crime was low ... something the player has no impact on.  In such a case however, I have scored a major victory having arrested all the co-conspirators.  However, had the value of the crime been higher, I would have done equally well having arrested no one but Burr.

I would also warn that there is a difference between the conspirators represented by counters and conspirators represented by cards.

My biggest mistake during my first play however was skipping the free Agenda roll in step 4b.

VPG production values are as we've come to expect.  The artwork here is rather lackluster as well.  A decent package but buy the game if the topic/gameplay interest you... not with an expectation of a game whose components are worthy of the price.

I use thick, Mayday mini Euro cards sleeves with this game (although the US mini would be a better fit).  I like how the thick cards bridge shuffle, and can't imagine playing the game without them (*lots* of shuffling the cheap paper cards).

I find it useful to track the total expedition strength using a penny on the prestige track, and I find that it is helpful organizing Evidence cards as the are accumulated in groups of 5 so I can keep track of how the defense and prosecution balance.

------

Funny thing is that after playing the game 8 times in the first three days of ownership, writing the above, and rating the game an 8 ... I let the game sit for several days, began a 9th game and quit five minutes into it.

The game has replayability, but once the newness wears off, I can't speak to whether it'll get on the table again.  The game has a lot going for it, but like most solitaire games it's not as multifaceted as its two player brethren.  It reminds me of one of those "choose your own adventure" books of yore.  Once you've played through it as few times, the plot variations get stale.  

It doesn't help that I've developed my own style that seems to win the game barring really bad card draws.

After three plays I gave this game an 8 ... after half a dozen plays I'd give it a 6.

A clever little game.  Lots of interesting history and neat effects.  Feels a little lame when the game ends without the trial phase.  Also feels super-swingy:  when I lose, it's not my fault, and when I win it's not my fault.

Despite the clever play, VPG's print-and-play quality components makes me feel like I've been had.

I don't think the Burr Conspiracy could possibly be better represented in a game. I am fascinated with Aaron Burr, so I was bound to love it. It's a solitaire game, but there's no reason you can't play with a friend as a sort of double Jefferson. Head and Heart? There's a Clue element in randomly setting aside 3 cards that make up the actual conspiracy at the beginning of the game and then trying to figure it out - the more you can rule out the better off you'll be, but often you will be forced to rush to trial just to make sure Burr doesn't carry out his plan, whatever it might be. Sometimes Burr will turn out to have peaceful intentions and sometimes he will be plotting no less than a military coup d'Ã©tat. Deduction of the truth will require you to proceed through a substantial portion of the deck, which also means giving Burr more time to maneuver. As is common in Victory Point Games, there is a hefty luck factor in the random cards that drive each turn and the dice that decide momentous events, and disgusting rolls can sabotage your efforts roundly. But the game moves so briskly that in the case of a bad draw compounded with bad rolls, you just accept your ill fortune, reset, reshuffle, and try again. This is also where the theme is a great help - if you did very poorly, chalk it up to bumbling lawyers, backstabbing politics, the devilish treachery of James Wilkinson, and the brilliant and devious mind of Aaron Burr. With that in mind, you'll always have a good time repeating or changing history. Stumbling across this game brought Victory Point Games to my attention, and I've bought several of their games since.

Superb historical strategy game based on the Aaron Burr chapter in US history. I really like how the conspiracy portion affects the trial portion, e.g. if you arrest Burr and his co-conspirators too soon, you may not have enough evidence to secure a verdict.

I'm sure experienced gamers had no trouble with the complexities here, but for us ordinary mortals, another story. Not the first time I've found the complexity of a VPG game to be misrepresented: Listed as 2.5, actual game marked 3. If the climbing games I like so well are also 3, this is closer to a 4. Found little joy in it...

More than most solitaire games, I really felt like the system was playing me rather than me trying to best the system. This game would be better if the three Jefferson policy tracks did not have such horrifically difficult die rolls. As it is there is just not enough prestige to do anything really.

UPDATE: I felt maybe I just had a bad session and I have to say I was wrong before. This is a good game with lots of guessing. Trial segment is the best part.

RATING: 8
A great solo game that tells a great story.  "Being President Jefferson" would be a good title.  The game itself isn't "super hard" like many solo games are.  But it also isn't very luck dependent. There's deduction (always great in a solo game), and resource management and it all hangs together excellently.

I just bought HoW, and I am looking forward to playing it

Edit after a few games:
a clever game, with lots of working mechanics.

The thing that I don't like is that, when you accuse Burr, you have to guess (with no clue) what other conspirators are helping him, so, it is a wild guess, sometimes.
The double-phase is a really interesting concept and I like it that, even the expedition goes through, and you haven't cought Burr, you can still pull out a victory (minor) if his daughter is among the conspirators, meaning that there is no certainty of loss 'till the very end.

I can play it in less than 45 minutes, including setup and teardown, so it is a game I am playing a LOT lately.

Rated after one play. Very promising solo game.

UPDATE: After a dozen plays, I haven't picked this one up in weeks. I imagine it will see play again in the future, but I'm not sure how many more surprises it has to offer. My hunch is that I need more depth/complexity from a solo game for it to have staying power.

A delight to play. Some superficial similarities with the State of Siege games, but Weehawken is much better, perhaps because it seems less linear. The trial phase and deduction elements are nicely integrated with the rest of the game, and the game very effectively brings the topic to life.

Terrible components in my version - the cards are essentially unshufflable, but I understand production has improved.

Great game with easy rules, fascinatingly historical theme, and nice interplay between the various game systems.  This game deserves the revamping that it is reportedly going to get from VPG in the future, as that is its only flaw: the low-budget game components.  I like playing with  rdmorss's variant "Hero of Weehawken: Balanced Conspiracy Objectives Variant".  It adds more realism, I think.  Hero of Weehawken has flown under the radar for too many solo gamers, which I hope will change.

A pretty nice solo game after the first play.  Some decisions to make and a pretty interesting story got told in the first go-round.  Should stand up to several more plays.  I learned a lot playing the game of a very interesting snippet of history I'd previously never known.

Jan '16: Another play, and my first real win.  A lot depends on the shuffle but you still have some impact.  Not totally sure on how to arrest Barr but think I got it right.  Quite impressed how such a game can bring out so much history.  I like how you have to select the charge you are brining based on who you think the conspirators are.  Nice illustrations and text on the cards as well, but they are difficult to shuffle.

RATING: 7
This is a unique solo gaming experience. It's a two-parter where you have to gain as much evidence as you can while at the same time trying to avoid a successful expedition by Burr, kind of like a push your luck game. The second part is simply making the right choice and rolling some dice to see if you can pull off a victory.

RATING: 6
As a design, I think that Robert Leonhard has done quite a job really, filtering all of the historical information into a system which to be fair, is a concise and structured journey. This is a very clever game and very interesting on the historical side, on the one hand, yet, on the other hand, I just found it rather dry for me. I guess, interesting history doesnât always translate into an interesting historical experience. I think that this is due to the abstraction of so many elements of the history into mechanical processes. Interesting as individual parts, maybe less so as a whole.

This is more about me not being a fan of abstract games which this ultimately is, or feels like for me. Added to this, is the deduction element and the randomness which I found not to my personal taste. For example, I was frustrated twice to find that one of the true conspirators was Aaron Burrâs daughter, who if  chosen as a true conspirator, means Burr is automatically not guilty. What??? Historically correct I assume, but irritating.

I generally donât like, nor am I any good at deduction games so it was a problem for me. It doesnât make it a bad game, just not my style. I do admire the way the whole game works actually. So ultimately, this is a game that I can see others enjoying, just not me so much.

If you like abstract games and deduction games, I would highly recommend Hero of Weehawken, as its a well designed, interesting game, but its simply not suited to my taste as much as other games.

RATING: 7
An unusual interesting system on an unusual interesting subject (historical, with plenty of detail and flavor text, but not a wargame)! Sort of "States of Siege" crossed with "Clue".

The deduction aspect adds some definite weird luck in a different way from many solitaire games. It might turn out that Burr is innocent, so you shouldn't even arrest him or go to trial! In that sense, it may just as much an "experience" game as a "competitive" game. (Similarly, there is a decision to be made about whether you are trying to maximize your probability of WINNING at all, or maximize your Victory Level. E.g. arresting certain suspects makes it harder for you to win, but can increase your VP level if you do win.)

In the first few plays, you may feel completely clueless about what to do, unlike States of Siege games where at least it's clear that you want to hold back the attackers.

Like most VPG games, the rules are good and clear. (Pay attention to the sequence of play.)

My edition (purchased in November 2015) is sort of strange: the player board and mats have places for cards which are designed for smaller cards, but the card deck is more standard sized cards, so they are totally too big to fit on the indicated spaces.

Don't let the obscure history scare you off (the game is a little tricky to get into at first) - this one is a winner, and it's just as educational as it is entertaining. 

Also, this is *not* a States of Siege game, so going into play with that mindset will only hinder your enjoyment.

The game was severely overhyped by VPG, and hopefully the obscure subject matter is not a turn off for would-be buyers - this can be an interesting and unique design.

RATING: 10
I've only played a handful of times, but I have to rate this a 10 given the fast play time, historical detail, and huge variability of each game. It appears fiddly and convoluted ... until you start playing, at which point it plays very smoothly. The mechanics melt away and with each card you feel like Thomas Jefferson receiving another piece of intelligence about Aaron Burr and his possible conspiracy. The historical detail is amazing. I would be glad if I could play this once and enjoy it, but so far it has been very replayable due to the large event deck, random setup, and large range of victory conditions.

Took me three games to finally win ... searched for Burr's conspirators, patiently collected evidence, and arrested Burr in Natchez before he could launch his expedition. The charge: an invasion of Mexico (a violation of the Neutrality Act of 1794).  At his trial, luck swung my way when Wilkinson was not indicted alongside Burr. My evidence triumphed over his defense, and Burr was sentenced to death. My Virginia dynasty, judicial reforms, and British diplomacy skills held the day to deliver a Decisive Victory!

Hero of Weehawken is a solitaire game in which the player takes the role of President Thomas Jefferson at a dangerous moment in the history of the United States. Former Vice President Aaron Burr is somewhere out west, and rumors abound that he is threatening the nation with plans for some sort of ill-advised military adventure that could bring America to war with Spain, or even a direct act of treason against the United States!
To forestall this disaster, you must first determine Burrâs real plans, then find and arrest him before he executes his plan; and, finally, gather sufficient evidence to convict Burr at trial. If your agents arrest him too soon, you will not have gathered enough evidence or figured out what to charge him with. If you wait too long, however, you may be too late to stop his nefarious plans.
Do you have what it takes to gather the right information in time? Be the judge and become the Hero of Weehawken!

I have tremendous respect for [i]Hero of Weehawken[/i].  Using intermeshing mechanical systems, the game convincingly captures the broad arc, worldly context, and historical minutiae of Aaron Burr's mad exploits.  The background research alone must have been enough to fill three thesis chapters on Burrian history.

Thanks to the designer's loving dedication to detail, an array of fanciful outcomes are possible each game.  Additionally, due to the plot twists tied to the hidden Conspiracy cards, the outcome of any one game is not revealed (perhaps surprisingly) until the game concludes.

In my first game, for instance, Wilkinson shot Burr and forced a quick ending (10 minutes in), whereas in my second 45-minute session Burr was eventually taken to trial and given the maximum sentence - only to have Wilkinson embarrass the Jefferson administration's prosecutorial attempts and reduce my victory level accordingly.

On the negative side, Weehawken is still a solo game - which means that I just don't have much interest in playing.  No offense to the world, but I'd rather read the rules to a new multiplayer or two-player game than invest time in a 1-player adventure.

Finally, as much as I admire what Weehawken does (and does well), the game leans much more heavily towards intellectual stimulation than nervous excitement.  The respectable prom date that you bring to the dance isn't the one that you necessarily take home, and you and I both know why.

RATING: 7
Very intereting historical theme that comes through strongly through the game.  Almost 2 games in one with the preparations for launching the conspiracy and the trial.  Yet, gameplay was not as exciting as hoped for.  The decisions in the game are not overly meaningful, especially during the trial and it was not as tense as most of the States of Siege games are.

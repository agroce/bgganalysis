Back in the twentieth century, what now seems a hackneyed theme of players competing to build a cathedral and impress the King was rather fresher.  

At the centre of this game are resource cards.  You use them to do just about everything and that's where the interest lies.  How many dare I bid on this year's agenda in order to gain a privilege (for more resources) or build a bit of the cathedral (worth victory points), given that I'll later need cards to build huts (more resources or more v.p.s when building the cathedral), attack other players or defend myself. 

Even back in the twentieth century, a few rough edges to this design were apparent.  Playing with the rules as written, it was quite easy for someone to get shut out and have no fun at all.  I play with a couple of house rules suggested by Derek Carver; an "uncle at court" who allows a single change of agenda card, and a player whose privilege is stolen is allowed to pick another from the stock.  All the same, grabbing a privilege early feels essential; six points for building a single piece of cathedral is huge.

The game is nicely produced with big chunky blocks of wood and decent quality cards.  The artwork doesn't bowl me over, but it's functional.  The rules are clear enough.

Points are so tight, as are resourse cards.  Pretty nasty game to eke out points.  Cards are used for different things and when to use them for what is a tough choice.  I'd like to play again with four.  I don't think it would ever get higher than a seven, but wouldn't drop below a six.  Decent enough game that snaps along decently.

RATING: 4
Not fun.  Few choices on your turn.  Too much direct confrontation... but if you like kicking opponents when they're down, you might enjoy this game.  Lots of leader-bashing and trying to stay in 2nd or 3rd place so you can swoop in for a win at the end.  There is a bit of a game here, but it's hard to catch the flow of the resource card production engine... essentially, you must spend most of your cards to win anything... then your opponents will pick on you because you don't have enough cards for defense... then you cannot produce any cards because your farm huts were burned down.  With one or two players in this "beaten down" position, some kingmaking issues develop.  The balance of the cards seems to be off since the shield cards are so important.  1 play with the alternate victory points for cathedral 2-2-2-3-3-4.  No desire to play again.

A game we all want to love, but it does have some shortcomings somehow. Really for gamers not just anyone. It has an ingenious mechanism for using your one hand of resource cards for several different key elements and learning to strike a balance to use the wisely will take a few plays. There is also perpetual discussion of variants that would polish it, as if it's a really rough uncut gem, in spite of beautiful production.

An economic engine game in which the engine only ever seems to run for a few minutes at a time -- start with an agenda for what the kingdom is dealing with (war, taxation, building, famine), and that determines how much different resource cards are worth for the time being. Then hold a multi-round auction to see who gets to fulfill the agenda for whatever rewards are up for grabs. Attack one another with cups and shields to rid them of shield cards, then burn their farms to reduce their income. Collect income. Lather, rinse, repeat. Some have said that there's a problem with the end game, that after the cathedral is completed, that a new agenda should be set and bonus victory points awarded for cards held by the players according to their value in that agenda (4 value cards are worth 1 bonus victory point, 3 & 2 value cards are worth 1/2 victory point each). Personally, I think this sort of end game lottery is not a good idea, much like putting money on Free Parking in monopoly. Victory points are hard to come by, and they should remain so, in my opinion. The bits are very nice!

RATING: 7
Another underrated game from TM Spiele, this is no Settlers but is an interesting and fun game. You can play the game as is, or with the Stuart Daggar variant of increasing the scoring for all cathedral pieces by one - it works either way. No tremendous long-term play value, to be sure, but it's a solid game that is worth bringing out repeatedly.

RATING: 4
Just a very uninspired and boring game, with awesome bits!

Krieg und Frieden is pretty much a game about winning auctions to score points, and then screwing with the other players in between those auctions.

Every round, the current start player gets to play a card showing what kind of auction players must bid on for the round.  The type of auction influences how many points of bidding power each type of resource in the game is worth (players have a hand of resources).  The winner of the auction is going to score some points, and maybe also gain a king's favor, which allows him to draw an extra resource each turn.

When the auction is over.  Players can then play resources to build up their fiefs, or play resources to screw with people, destroying their fiefs.  Once players are done screwing around with this, they get to draw cards based on their fiefs and favors, and a new round is started.

So, the game boils down to some pretty boring auctions with take-that card play in between them.  There's a somewhat interesting decision in how much to bid vs. how much to hold back for the screwery phase since both phases utilize the cards in your hand, but overall it's just a boring exercise.

It's really too bad the game play doesn't live up to the awesome overproduced bits!  If it did, it would be a winner.  But, it doesn't, so there's that.

I'd perhaps play again with the variant rules which seem to be recommended here on BGG....but not with the rules out of the box. The game itself is beautiful, and I like the flow of the game.

My biggest beef is that the scoring is too constricted and that the ability to steal cards is mostly out of the control of the players. Some of the biggest factors in the game are outside your control.

Finally, seems hard to imagine that a player other than whoever wins the final round auction is going to win. Fairly anticlimactic. I really don't think I need to bother to play it again. Feels like a game that may have deserved some attention years ago, but much better designs out there now.

Charlemagne I got many moons ago during a sale when I still had no idea what I liked and what not. I read through the rules, but could not find time to try the game. I gave it a few half-hearted tries, to no avail, and eventually sold it off. My girlfriend wanted to keep the game since it featured a circular board, and that, in her opinion, meant that it couldn't be bad.

Now forward to a few years later when I was able to attempt the game anew, seriously this time. It was a disaster. The rules did not go over well, although my fellow players eventually caught on. But they despised the silly card mechanics which seemed to provoke hitting on each other for no good reason other than to curtail their ability to score points. The game's annoying tendency to 'reset' itself—meaning that whatever you do is always fleeting and any plan you care to think of easily ruined by other players—soon had everyone's teeth on edge. Take for example the 'bonus' points you're able to obtain by having huts near the cathedral. It takes quite a lot of effort on your behalf to put them there. But you can be targetted by all other players to lose them. The only defense is having a lot of cards. But then you don't get to bid for the destiny card which is the only way in which you're able to build a cathedral section [i]and[/i] you run the risk of losing cards thanks to the blunt equaliser called the Emperor's Mercy. Everything you can think of has been offset by something at least equally nasty. In this way, Charlemagne resembles the horrible Beestenveiling (High Society). The winner of the game is the player who did not lose as much as the others.

We broke off after a few rounds, so I cannot say whether the infamous 1-1-1-2-2-3 point awarding table is good or bad. I suspect bad, as huts near cathedrals are prime candidates for torching. And then... My girlfriend made a face and pronounced this title [i]really[/i] bad and stupid. And very grudgingly admitted I was right at the time in selling it off. In other words: avoid this turd unless you like excessively confrontational games where weasling is the only option and having a lucky break is the only thing which may win the game for you. A rating of '2' may sound harsh as the game isn't really broken, and I sure can stomach direct conflict; but the approach where as a player you are expected to build something you cannot properly defend seems so annoyingly pointless that I won't play this game ever again.

Very confrontational and "take that!" for a german game. There seems to be a large luck element via the card deals (we had one player draw a total of 3 wheat cards all game) and there's definitely a high amount of chaos (via changing card values, card deals, burning houses, etc). I'm also not happy with the rapidly accelerating cathedral values which *almost* guarantees a win to the player who builds the last piece. I had a lot of angst and fun playing this, but I'm not convinced its that great.

Interesting game where players are attempting to build pieces of the monastery.  In order to build a piece and earn points they must win the round by playing the highest value of cards, but the value of the suits changes from round to round.

The first play of this left me with the feeling that we must have done something wrong, which is not usually a good sign.  The awarding of victory points was so mechanically limited and stingy, that I was left wondering what happened and why are there so many more scoring markers included in the game?

As it turns out, we did miss a rule - although I don't know that it would have changed my feelings too much.  And guess what?  The game ended with the final cathedral piece auction deciding the winner between all three players - surprise!

We need to play with four, and obviously with the Dagger scoring.  I have hopes that my rating will rise, although I wonder if there is enough there there to get it much higher.

Played for the first time in years. Nice bits, but disappointed with the game play and especially the end game.

This rating is tentative, as it comes after one play.  Krieg und Frieden is a game that I have admired from a far for a long time now.  I always liked how it looked with it's round board, and chunky wooden bits, but for some reason I never really pursued it.  Well things change and I was finally able to obtain a copy and get it to the table rather quickly.  My fanciful wonderings were not misled.  I played with the Stuart Dagger variant, as suggested, and was soon taken by the elegant little design here.  I will agree with the geeks that say this is primarily a card game, but the bits in this one add a lot.  The mechanics are clever in that all the cards in hand, are currency for all actions in the game (similar in a sense to San Juan).  This makes solid  hand management crucial.  Although Krieg is entirely based around the cards and card draw, the ability to change the year's agenda makes having a bad draw almost moot - this occurs because one can, by sacrificing a priveledge, change the value of all the cards and turn their hand from weak to strong.   With the cards being the currency for all things, one has to decide when to sacrifice cards for actions.  There are more strategies in Krieg than are apparent in the first few rounds -  Taking control of the agenda, when to downsize to obtain the king's bounty( a move that is double edged), and when and how many cards to risk to burn an opponents village are just a few.  Krieg und Frieden is more than a pretty package, it offers a lot of game play and is sadly over looked here on the geek.  I can't wait to play again.

UPDATE:  I find the complaints that the last turn is overpowered unwarranted.  If you can control the agenda, as not to finish too early, then you can either secure your lead by winning priviledges and a victory point or play a little catch up and allowing yourself to strengthen your hand.  Also the suggestion this game is lost in the first couple rounds is false in my opinion.  If you control the agendas early on and run out too quickly , then your game is at the mercy of those who still have them.  Timing is essential here, and again so is smart hand management.

not really an update:  Proposed variant not yet played: if in winning the agenda bid, the player has the option to either take the alloted one victory point and priviledge or be allowed to take two VP's and no priviledge. Does anyone think this may have a strong effect on the end game, as far as the strength of the final cathedral build?

First couple of plays. Charlemagne (as is titled the Dutch version I own) is, at first glance, a thematic prototype of more recent games such as Keythedral and Pillars of the Earth. Charlemagne has slightly more basic, but nevertheless attractive, components and simpler gameplay than its heirs, though the rules make a meal of describing what should be straightforward. However, where the game fails is in the area of victory conditions. The vast majority of victory points are acquired for building a cathedral section - this occurs at only 6 points throughout the game and each time only 1 player benefits. It is very easy for one or two of the players to fall behind because they fail to win a single bid for building, or they win a bid when they have no worker's huts. And the potential for success at bidding depends partly on the luck of the cards and partly on controlling the agenda (for which an early win at bidding for a privilege is more or less a requirement). All of my fellow players regard Charlemagne as a very poor game. I hold out some hope that the game could be "fixed", but the variants proposed to date seem to help to only a limited degree.

I really wanted to like this, the game itself is beautiful! But I was left feeling as if I'd missed a rule somewhere. I must have read the rules 5 times over during the game, but we were playing it right after all. The middle game is just completely monotonous, bid, bribe, tax, discard. Repeat. I couldn't wait for it to end. And it's true, the player who did the best in the last round won the game, so what's the point.

The gripe against this game has been that it's all about who wins the last round. And that's pretty true even with the variant scoring. However the game designer made it known that that is what he was attempting to do in this game. With players who know how the game works it becomes quite tense as you jockey for position in setting yourself up for the final round. A solid game.

Players are advisers to the King trying to gain his favor by solving issues in the kingdom. The game works on abstracted card symbols and is quite easy to learn.

You seek to score points by building a cathedral and winning privileges.  In the process, you auction for the right to be the king's advisor to win the right to a privilege or build a cathedral and earn points, play 1 of 4 different types of cards which allow you to build workhouses, farmhouses, bribe enemy soldiers, or fight with a knight.  One can score bonus points if they win the cathedral card auction and destroy their own workhouses (1 point per workhouse).  Every two farmhouses grants an extra resource card during the harvest.  Privileges allow you to pick out a specific card type directly related to the privilege.  This game can be a bit on the mean side for a Euro as you do directly attack each other and there can be some picking on the leftovers that occurs.

We played with the usual simple fixes (i.e. Stuart Dagger variant) to the scoring, and found a game that was great! Made me wonder why it's been so overlooked, in fact. Not too forgiving of mistakes, but that's another way of saying it rewards good play. Also, it's not as long as I'd expected, coming in comfortably at 90 minutes or less.

05/21/11 Played a four-player game. My opinion of Krieg und Frieden is mixed. It looks nice. I like the elements within (auction, building, attacking). But for some reason it drags. I think we played 11 rounds, but it felt like twice that. The last turn being worth more didn't bother me. The game struck me as kinda blah. Its as if you followed a recipe for a cake and put in the proper amounts of flour, eggs, sugar, etc., baked it the proper time, but the end result had little taste. Not bad, but not worth the time and effort you spent on it. Therefore, I doubt we'll be playing this game more than once a year in future.

Interesting fixed length game.  I liked it very much, even though I gleefully burnt down my neighbor's farm, only to give her the King's Bounty, thereby allowing her to take half my hand after my card draws, and further allowing her to cruise into the final Adviser slot--finishing the cathedral and winning the game.  Still...burn, baby, burn!!

Hmm, we played one four-player game with the alternate recommended scoring, but it still felt like there were runaway-leader problems. Quite possibly this needs some experienced players before it becomes a good game. (I traded this because I have Keythedral, which is similar enough mechanics and theme for my taste, and I like it better.)

In feudal times, acquire shields, land and build pieces of the cathedral. Friend spent $60 to buy it and really wanted to like it. As the rules stand, no one seemed to be able to accumulate shields. It was chaotic with kinghts being played back and forth, king's mercy and so forth. But maybe instability is the way the game is supposed to be played. Friend tried putting fixes (no King's mercy, only 3 cards allowed to be played, no stripping an opponent down to below 2 huts, once shields are won, they are permanent), and it worked only slightly better. There maybe something to the game, but since I'm not interested in watching knights go back and forth for some greater purpose, I give it a rating of 4.

Game is so card-intensive that the (circular! yay!) board and wooden houses are almost unnecessary.  Goblet cards are somewhat underpowered, and not getting any wheat cards can cripple you in the early going through no fault of your own.

Once you get beneath the wonderful circular board, wooden cathedral bits and huts, and the superb artwork, it all boils down to a disappointingly simple card collection game. Stripping away the theme, the player who won the last round sets the prize for the next round (high VP’s or higher card income) and the "suit order" (ie which suit is worth 4, which 3, which 2, which 1), hopefully in such a way that suits his own hand. Whoever bids the set of cards of highest ‘value’ wins the prize. After this auction, players are then lured to forego their future bidding power by spending cards to build huts. One hut type gives you more cards each round, building income. One hut type provides extra VP’s if you win the cathedral prize. Another card type allows you to suck out knight cards from other players. The last card type (the knight) allows you to whack another player’s hut if they don’t play a matching knight card to veto it. A successful whack provides 2 bonus cards, but you usually need at least 2 cards before the other player is devoid of knights - and then you don’t have any for your own defense, you’re not gaining anything overall, and you’ve set yourself up as a potential victim for the next player. The variant scoring systems (2,2,2,3,3,4 for the cathedral, plus extra vp for privilege, plus cards are worth points at the end) all seemed like they helped balance the game, but winning the last auction is still powerful and can/should leap you into the lead ... but getting the cards you need to win that last auction, even if you know what's coming, is a complete lottery. Much like all the previous auctions really. It's a game of opportunism. If you have good high cards, bid for it. Otherwise raise the bid, then pass and save 'em. As such, for 2 hours of gameplay, there's no tension, little drama, little strategy ... just opportunism. Nice bits, nice theme, shame about the game.

This is a heavy thinking game and while the rules aren't long, there is quite a bit to remember.  I am giving it a high rating because I like the deep tactical options. This may go down if the rules begin to feel burdensome.  I don't think it will go up (although an '8' is pretty good).

Who can play?  Family game for 2-4 players.

I really enjoyed this one, and it worked well with my friends.  It reminded me of other games that we didn't like as much, but it seemed lively and quicker so that was welcome.  I looks pretty cool too.  It's a very simple game, so don't expect a ton of strategy, except maybe "who should I screw the most?"  Can be mean and fun.  I've played with 2,3, and 4 players.  2 player is pointless, 3 player is OK, but you really want to play this game with 4.

Interesting, beautiful church-building game, with some brutal direct conflict. I does have a somewhat awkward feel to it.

What's basically going on here is that you have a hand of cards that can be used for three different things:
1) Win victory points, in an auction.
2) Build houses, that potentially give you more cards and VPs.
3) Defend yourself from other players - or attack them.

And you can only use the cards once, for one of these three things, and then they're gone. So you just won the victory points this turn? Congratulations, but now you're low on cards so you won't be able to win the VPs next turn, you won't be building houses, and the other players will pounce on you and destroy the buildings you had previously built and/or take the few cards you had remaining from you. Do you instead choose to keep your hand well stocked with cards? Good for you, but you're not getting any victory points, and you won't have any control over future rounds.

So in any given turn, one or two players (usually those ahead in VPs) will be in a bad position (low on cards), practically skipping their turns, and an easy target for the others. This allows the others to catch up with them. Having no options and being at the mercy of the other players is really not much fun, though. It's also really hard to get out of. Only when you've reached the point where you have almost no cards AND almost no buildings AND you're behind on VPs, does the game allow you to get extra cards.

It's a balancing act, between getting screwed one way or the other. You want VPs, but not too many, you want to build houses, but not too many, and you want to attack other players, but not too much. Then you reach the last turn, which semi-randomly determines the winner.

It's intriguing, it's different, it has a great mix of building and attacking, but you'll also probably be glad when it's over, and you can play another game that's more fun and more rewarding.

Halfway through the explanation, I knew I would dig this game.  Beautiful bits, hand management, timing, elegant mechanics that individually are reminiscent of tried-and-true systems, but the synthesis is greater than the parts.  I'm a teeny bit worried about the kingmakerish nature of fighting, and the Mercy of the King seems a little klunky and vulnerable to extremes.

Hey, what do you know?  A Eurogame with direct confrontation.  Who would have thunk it.  For all intents and purposes this really is more of a card game than a boardgame, the board is just there to mark what you've invested in and to build the Cathedral.  This one uses a great variable card value system based on what is being auctioned.  There are always too few cards in hand for what you would like to do, and every thing has a purpose.  Each season rewards those that saved their cards, but of course you have to spend your cards to reap the rewards.  Very elegant even with so much stuff piled into the rules.
On top of that the game is just downright beautiful.  Wonderful gaming experience.

This game holds up pretty well over time.  While the scoring system is peculiar, I don't think it necessarily needs fixing.  It is clear that the winner will usually (almost always) be whoever builds the last cathedral piece, as it brings in the largest point bounty AND immediately ends the game, denying anyone a chance to whack the new leader.  Therefore the wise player plays to get into position to build that piece.  If everyone is being similarly sensible, you end up with a cracking cat-and-mouse battle of wits at the endgame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting game - this is an auction game at its heart, and that by setting the agenda, you affect the parameters of the auction.  I like how easy it is to mess with the other players, and there's a nice catch-up mechanism that those without many resources can apply for welfare and collect from the other players.

UPDATE: Missed a couple of rules and I find it very well-balanced.  Definitely deserves its 7.5

One play, Stuart Dagger variant. An interesting game, but too much direct conflict for Mary (even though she was the one who started it!!). Good, but not good enough to keep -- traded for unpunched Struggle of Empires.

Deal out the agenda cards, which show 1 of 4 types of agendas, and either cathedral pieces (12 cards) or scrolls (4 cards). Each agenda type gives different value (1-4) to the 4 different resources. The King's Advisor (whoever got start player marked card in deal) puts an agenda up; players may change agenda by discarding a Privelege. Then, players bid, using resource cards (with values based on agenda type) for the right to execute agenda, and become new Advisor. Bidding is neat -- place cards in rows, one per round; winner discards all cards, losers keep last row and discard the rest. If scroll token on agenda card, they take a Privilege (and 1VP in base game, 2VP in Dagger variant). If castle token, they build next cathedral piece (worth 1-1-1-2-2-2-3 in base game;  1 in Dagger variant). Then, starting with King's Adviser, use cards to take actions: build farms, promote farms to workers, bribe knights (play Cup card to force target to discard Shield), attack (play Shield; they match if possible; if not, destroy a building and you get 2 resources). Finally, collect income: 1   1/pair farmers   1/privilege (of matching type, taken from discard pile). Play until cathedral finished; most VP wins.

Neat looking... but. Game is built around getting that last piece in the cathedral in. Despite my joy at burning huts, there is a certain amount of "beat the leader" present (or "beat the guy with no cards left.") Very attractive game.

This was quite an interesting game. Hardly any table talk during the whole game as people were trying to think about the best way to accomplish their goals. Not once did anybody change the agenda proposed by the King's Advisor, which might be an aberration or something to do with our group's groupthink. Lots of attacking opportunities in the game; confrontation is always good.

This is a great game. The components have nice art and look great. It is simple, and results in a tense game. But you have to use the variants that have been proposed (new scoring during Spring, the new King's Bounty, and the variant end game scoring). Yes, the original game had some faults, but with the proposed fixes the whole games shines. I have uploaded a player's aid that describe all the changes that game needs.

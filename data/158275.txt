I tried this at BGG Con 2014 and was kind of meh about it. But my wife bought the starter kit and some booster packs (ahh!) and we were hooked. We later bought a gravity feed on sale (halfsies with a friend) and had a "draft" to split up the cards. This is more strategic than it looks on the surface but fairly quick and pretty fun.

Bought the AvX starter decks and about $30 of boosters. Unfortunately didn't have any friends who were into it and only ended up playing it a couple times at a board game shop with an employee. Seemed like a really fun variant of games like MtG, but I ended up selling my cards.

A fun two player game. 
The artwork is stunning the game play is fun and gripping.
I have found at times one player can jump ahead, and become over powered, but things get balanced out the more we play, as we learn the right combos.

This is difficult as I think if played against other Dice Masters collectors and not as a two player casual type game splitting a single collection it would work better and be higher rated for me. I'm hoping Quarriors gives a similar feel with better balancing for a couples game.

I like this one just a teensy more than the Avengers vs X-men stuff, if only because I feel they've had the chance to achieve a better balance, and I prefer the focus on just the X-Men characters. Also, I didn't really miss the bus on this one so it's been easier for me to acquire packs. That said, I'm unlikely to play this without mixing it up with cards from the other sets.

Really fun, slightly thinky deck-building game- but with dice and a super hero theme. The MTG-like attack system feels familiar, but the bag-building system is unique and the dice rolling aspect adds a nice balance of luck. Really superb two player skirmish game.

Sadly, this game suffers from bloating due to too many sets. I think I may try to complete the UXM set and have it as a Drafting game. Maybe

Quarriors, but with a superhero theme and your own personal (collectable) dice to pull from rather than a common wilds pool. No culling, and 2 player only.

Collectable nature (blind boosters) kills this for me, and I'm not that much into X-men either. Much rather play quarriors.

Ecletic Games - October 2014

RATING: 5
I think this game was made because they wanted to sell lots of cards and dice. Even though it is a simple game, the rules are too convoluted for what it is. The decisions you make while playing are mostly obvious and combat doesn't feel satisfying from a thematic sense, you're just moving dice around. There is some entertainment in building your own team of heroes, but you have to go out and buy a bunch of boosters and hope you randomly get the hero cards you want.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
So a character immediately gets rerolled as soon as they're defeated? What kind of sense does that make? And gameplay-wise, that means that a big strong character like Hulk can just be blocked by a chump like a sidekick, and accomplish next to nothing because the defeated blocker will just be rerolled as soon as their turn comes around.
This game had a lot of potential, but this rule just ruined the whole thing for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Have bought a bunch of packs but haven't played this set. The hype has died down for me somewhat. Is it a good game? sure. Is it necessary in one's collection? maybe. If you're not a part of a steady, competitive scene is it going to be hitting the table very much? I don't know...it doesn't for me.

RATING: 9
So surprised by the depth here. We, as a rule, despise collectable games. And yet every Sunday we go pick up five booster packs to serve as spoils for that days games. My wife loves it, I love it, the kids love it, the dog loves it. Even the fish loves it and he's a total a-hole. 

We got this intent on a lark and a laugh with some fun dice rolling and brand-theme excitement but instead found ourselves focused/driven/obsessed with playing just one more round and besting each other in a game with far more going on than we at all anticipated. 

Totally recommended. 

Caveat: Plays much better with player aides and boards (even handdrawn on paper). Much better.

If you invest heavily, it's a pretty decent game. If you don't, it gets old pretty fast. I only have a starter set, and I didn't find this game particularly tactical. Perhaps the tactics come in how you assemble your team, which would require having tons more dice to do effectively.

I'm looking to trade/sell. It comes with the base set, with unused dice bags, and also 45 additional dice and their corresponding cards from both the Uncanny X-Men and Avengers vs X-Men sets. It's missing the instructions but they have very detailed instructions on the WizKids website.

The game is real easy to pick up.  But it has the same problem that Magic the Gathering has.  Rare cards are hard to come by, and if you did not pick up the Avengers vs X-Men sets, you could find yourself facing cards and dice you may only be able to see on eBay.  I'll play casually, but I would never go into a tournament with what I have.

I love the theme. I love the feel of it and the tension of watching your opponent re-roll those powerful character dice while hoping he gets hosed. There are elements that remind me of Magic which I'm a huge fan of. There's a lot I really want to grab onto and run with in this game, but something holds me back. I'm not exactly sure why I'm not all in, but I think it comes back to the extreme luck based nature of the game. I can dominate a game and at the very end, I just stop rolling my good stuff while my opponent pounds away. You're helpless with nothing you can do beyond hope maybe you get a good roll next time. On the plus side, this random nature does help level the playing field so you can play and compete against someone with a bunch of rares. They're still at an advantage, but it's not like facing a tournament legal MTG deck with your own casual deck. 

I was given this as a gift and I do have fun with it, but I probably wouldn't go buy it myself and it's not a go-to game for me.

- 8/10/2016 Compro 7 daus/cartes a Drakkar per 7€ (hi ha la rara del Prof.X que costa la meitat de la compra...)]]]
Mescla de deckbuilding amb daus i Magic. Enfocat a 1x1.
Joc ràpid, amb estratègia i atzar tot i que en part controlable. Està molt bé perquè pots fer vàries partides de cop i s'ho val: jugues d'una manera i guanyes, i el rival a la següent troba com frenar-te i et guanya. Llavors tu fas el mateix, i planteges una contra-estratègia per frenar al rival. Estàs analitzant lo que fa el rival, no pots desconnectar del que fa i anar a la teva. Molt bona la interacció aconseguida.
Febrer'16: lo anterior és en les condicions de partida inicial, 2 o 3 personatges per jugador, amb 2 daus per personatge. Recentment hem provat amb 4 personatges per jugadors (i 2 daus per personatge), i ara ja s'ha de fer anar més el coco. No és tant ràpid.
Agost'16: Ja juguem amb 8 personatges per cap i 20 daus. Les partides són més lentes.

Don't understand why Tom Vasel likes this so much. The rule book is about the worst I have seen and would be almost impossible to learn the game from it. I don't like the collectible aspect of the game. The game play itself is somewhat interesting/fun but you have to continually look at the special powers on each card to make the best decisions and its far from obvious how the powers interact with each other.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
Para hablar claro, el Dice Masters es uno de los juegos con peor relación calidad-precio que he visto. Sí, el starter es barato, pero es que si solo tienes eso no podrás hacer prácticamente nada: gran parte de la gracia del juego consiste en formar tus propios equipos y combinaciones, y con el limitadísimo número de dados que te vienen en el starter no vas a poder hacer casi nada. En términos gastronómicos, el starter sería como una cata, un pequeño bocado para que veas si te gusta el asunto antes de lanzarte a la piscina... pero vamos, que en un par de partidas lo has quemado.

Ahí entramos en la compra de sobres, y desde luego no van a ser uno o dos. Para tener un juego razonablemente completo, calculo que hay que gastar en torno a 80-100 € (contando con lo que cuenta el starter), y una vez que tienes todos esos dados te das cuenta que no merece la pena tanto gasto. El juego en sí no es malo, pero sí bastante normalillo, y desde luego no vale la inversión que tienes que hacer para poder disfrutarlo en condiciones. No soy de los que se fijan en el precio de un juego (para mí si un juego es bueno da igual cuanto cueste), pero es que en este caso ya es sangrante la de pasta que te puedes dejar para algo tan "del montón".

En cuanto a la jugabilidad, hay que tener presente que el nivel de azar es absurdamente alto: al componente habitual de no saber lo que vas a robar cada turno (presente en cualquier juego de cartas/dados coleccionables), hay que sumarle el hecho de que, una vez robado un dado, no sabes qué resultado vas a obtener al lanzarlo... hay mecanismos para controlar ligeramente este azar (puedes relanzar una vez los dados que elijas), pero aun así la partida será bastante caótica. Desde luego, si ambos jugadores tienen más o menos la misma experiencia y número de dados diferentes, la partida normalmente la decidirá el azar en vez de su habilidad.


[b]PD:[/b] El juego es una "versión mejorada" del Quarriors, así que si eres de los pocos que lo disfrutaron, seguramente este Dice Masters te encante.

RATING: 7.5
I tried it solo to get the rules down, but it turned out to be a great game to play solo. 
So much so that this (and Avengers vs X -Men) is at the moment my favorite solo game!
It's cool to try different combinations against each other and since there is no hidden info and the the dice rolls make it highly tactical (as most options are only set after your (re)roll) it's a very cool game for two sided solo.

It's quick to set up, quick to play and has an addictive quality I can't quite explain...

I went in heavy on Dice Masters and found out that it's just a very average game.  Ok, yes, it's almost entirely dice, so it's not fair to criticize how the game is entirely dependent on dice.  So, I'll just say that this game is probably really for those that are hardcore about dice and/or the theme.  If you're looking for solid, engaging gameplay, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

Quarriors meets Magic.   Yeah, this is a better system than Quarriors.   There is still a lot of luck, but the re-rolls help to manage that, and the combat system is just plain better.  The theme is a pretty big miss if you stop to think about it.  So, don't.   It's just a dice builder, with combat, with a superhero flavor.   Making $1 boosters was probably a brilliant idea.  The quality is typical WizKids...  which is to say very poor.   Bent cards, mis-shapen dice, bad paint, etc.   But you know that going in, so the low price isn't unfair.

My all encompassing review of Dicemasters: Really, it's the best two player competitive experience out there right now. Careful thought and understanding probabilities goes a long way towards building a solid "deck," and the winner is usually the one who knows how to manipulate the odds well. It's "random" but it is random in a predictable manner, and still capable of producing those once a year turns that turn a sure loss into a narrow victory. Even if I never purchase another booster, I am confident this game will continue to get played for many years.

I love building squads to play. I love learning how abilities interract with other abilities. I love seeing Cyclops destroy a whole team.

Unfortunately Wizkids aren't great at making their rules totally clear, and it has taken some experimentation and external research to know exactly how things work in the game. That being said, I love this game.

A really great 2 player dice game. The best description is really more or less a cross between Quarriors and Magic the Gathering, which is a fantastic combination. It's fast and possibly the most strategic dice game I've ever played, with lots of great theme and wonderful artwork (not to mention all the gorgeous dice). The only two things to warn about I think are 1) it's collectable, which is sometimes fun but also sometimes irritating and 2) the combat rules can be confusing when first learning the game (in terms of knocked out vs used up). Otherwise it's fantastic.

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

The asymmetry and direct conflict is a welcome addition to the deck/pool building genre, but adding randomness on top of randomness is a major turnoff for me.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2014)

It seems I’m getting into this game more deeply than I wanted to, but it is very hard to fight against the urge to get all the cards and dice. For now I’m enjoying my plays of Dice Masters but I feel there is something off synch in combat. Most of my previous comments still apply, so I will copy some of them.

Dice masters is (obviously) very Quarriors! derivative so I wasn’t expecting much, however I found the game to be the superior because:  1. The game is only for two players, so the playtime is relatively short. 2. Now you can re roll your dice reducing the luck factor substantially. 3. If your dice get knocked off (or were blocked) you will use them in the next turn. All of that contributes to make the game a lot better. Also I really enjoy the Marvel universe (but the theme is pretty thin).

On a personal level I abandoned MtG a long time ago and now I feel I’m relapsing with Dice Masters. I really hate random distribution boosters, but I can attest it is very effective as I have the urge to buy more to complete the set. I’m not sure about the power level of the rare and super rare cards, but I would think they are very powerful, so if I want to play competitively I would need to get them. This is a hate/love relationship for me.

I don’t plan to play in tournaments (there are none in my country even if I wanted to) but I read there are some tournament exclusive cards. That’s a very negative point for me as I don’t have any chance to pick them up at a reasonable price.

The components (in general) are great, all those dice really look gorgeous BUT the bags are pretty crappy, I don’t plan on using them.

I have some dice from Dice Masters AvX and I noticed that the dice in the Uncanny expansion for the same characters have similar faces, but different colors. I’m wondering if it is tournament legal to play with dice from the two sets for a single character (for example Wolverine?). This would make collecting the dice so much easier.

The deckbuilding aspect of the game is very fun, however it is also very time consuming because there are many options. I´m not sure I want to delve deeply into it. Perhaps I will copy some decks from the internet. It can be very expensive to form the deck you want because of the rarity of some cards. Also you need 4 dice per card so this contributes to elevate the cost while making useless all the repeat cards.

Bottom line, Dice Master is now a solid 6.0 for me. I plan to play it often in the near future to see if I should get all the cards or not. I really wish this wasn’t a collectible game but I guess it makes much more money for Wizkids. I really dig the LCG format from FFG and if Wizkids used it I surely would buy all the expansions for the game.

I’m upgrading Marvel Dice Masters: Uncanny X-Men´s rating. It is, without a doubt,  a fun game. 

On the other hand it seems Wizkids Games is no longer selling Dice Master over the internet. That’s a shame because this is the only way I could get them. In my country almost no store carries them and I don’t plan to participate on tournaments anyway. I guess I should thank them because they saved me a lot of money, it seems I already bought all the Dice Masters I will ever have.

Current Rating: 6.5

RATING: N/A
Better and more balanced than the previous set.  Adds a lot of fun mechanisms to the game and rewards combining your characters in interesting ways.  Works great with the previous set.  Pretty much zero power creep which is a great thing to see in games like this.

RATING: 8
I like this game a lot, but I wish I loved it.  I love the deduction, theme, artwork etc. . . but this is primarily a different game with a deduction sub-game.  It's possible to win the game without knowing much of the underlying puzzle.  It has a lot of depth, the potential for double-bluffs when players have experience, and it's a tight game where you can get hosed by turn-order.  Still a very good game!

First expansion to the Marvel Dice Masters focuses more on the mutants -- but it's still a CDG requiring you to buy more than just the starter to get some decent variety.

PLUS: theme is present, more characters
BIG MINUS: collectible games can imbalance it in favour of those who spend on it

12-01-2014 - I'm not a CCG (CDG) kind of guy, but I fell for this one hook, line and sinker.  It's a lot of fun, but honestly I think half the fun is buying and opening the boosters, not the game play at all!  Although I do enjoy the game play as well.  It's quick and strategic with ways to mitigate the luck that is inherent with dice games like this.  Lots of fun.  8 for now.

Not bad nice little 2 player game. You could expand easily if you wanted but be careful not to lose your wallet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In this game — which features Wolverine, Magneto, Cyclops, Iceman, Psylocke, the Sentinels and more — each player fields a superhero team, with each hero being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of 15 dice, and a player can "purchase" dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards will be available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.

About the game: 

Marvel Dice Mastes: Uncanny X-Men is a two-player dice building game set in the Marvel universe. 
The basic game mechanic is that both players start out with the same dice and individualize their pool of dice by adding special dice. It is comparable to deck building games. 
The aim of the game ist to bring the opponent to zero life points. This is achieved by deploying some of the dice as "fighters" to the field while other dice provide support in form of special actions.


My opinion: 

Marvel Dice Masters is a great little dice game. First of all I really like the different dice and the artwork of the different cards. 
At first I had some problems to get my head around the system which is used to move the dice from one part of the board to the other, but after my first game that problem was solved. I would say that it is in fact very easy once one has seen the game played. 
What I don't like is that the game is a collectible game. Of course it is necessary to have expansions, but I simply don't like the uncertainty when I open up my Booster. 
What it does not make it completely annoying is that the dice/ cards seem to be balanced quite well. At least from my point of view. By now I have not seen a huge gap between rare and common cards, but that might be to my little experience with the game. 
Other than that, I didn't like the components that came with the box (except the dice and cards). The bags are made of paper and I had to print out the board which is a little bit of a let down for a game in that price category. 

Nevertheless I really enjoy the game and would recommend it. The gameplay is great, near to fantastic. The artwork and the dice are fantastic and I really enjoy the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I don't understand the hype for this game. The dice building engine doesn't feel particularly strong, since you are only buying a handful of dice each game, half the faces of each die are just resources, and the dice add to much luck compared to a deckbuilder of what you can do each turn. The KO mechanic returning dice to your pool rather than having them take a while to return feels unthematic to me. The game feels swingy based on how many dice you had KOed your previous turn. I don't like how you can block larger dice with smaller ones without the excess damage going through. While I don't think it's a bad game, I don't understand how making a few tweaks to Quarriors and pasting on a superhero theme makes this suddenly on top of the hotness.

RATING: 5.5
Great game that is hampered by its collectible nature and requirement to keep up with the relentless release schedule. Those factors made me give up on it.

PROS
- Great licensing here allowing you to play DC vs Marvel vs TMNT vs etc.
- overall the dice are very cool.
- quick playing with a small footprint.
- really good fan-made solo variant.
- "Dice building" mechanic twist on "deck building"
- There is some depth to the game if you get serious about it by collecting the "good" cards and/or looking for good combinations.
- Two good, serious players going head to head can be quite the cerebral battle as both attempt to setup combos and defensive counters.

CONS
- collectible nature of the game with tiered cards (Common, Uncommon, Rare, etc) means that it's not a level playing field like a LCG. Some people have cards others didn't get access too or weren't willing to buy in the secondary market.
- Wizkids quality control.
- Wizkids release schedule.
- The game doesn't promote characters as much as just random individual cards... so if you want to play Superman and Spiderman just for fun, their cards could potentially be terrible whereas Cheetah or Aunt May could be amazing cards.
- It's hard to play the game casually because then you miss the depth of the serious game. It can just become a random grind or very unbalanced because of the cards drafted or chosen for fun.
- Related to the above, there isn't any support for the casual player with for example recommended starting teams.
- Overall, not worth the price of keeping up with the game, hunting down cards, list building vs the overall gameplay experience.

*Logged plays are for all Dice Master games.

Fun, but not totally intuitive, especially at first.  I love the idea of "dice building," but even with the endless supply of cards that are available, it starts to feel a little samey.  I also don't like the Global abilities (too hard too keep track of without them all being in front of me).  Being harsh though.  Dice chucking fun!

This is just an OK light vs game.  I really don't understand the hype behind it.  The mechanics aren't as intuitive and easy to learn as I would have liked.  Not a difficult game to learn and play if you commit to it but the gameplay is just not that fun.  What it has going for it is that it's not that expensive and the dice are beautifully made.  The cards have good art on them for the most part but are cheaply made.

If you don't want to get into the "competitive" scene then just the starter set will work for you.  I buy boosters simply because there are certain characters I like that are not in the starter set.

CCG style game but dice-driven. The combinations of characters (and there are loads of them) allow tons of customization and different combos to explore. The theme is strong in what each character can do although not so much in the mechanics of the game itself. You really need to think defensively in this as a strong attack against your opponent can leave your defenses empty, if you're not careful, and susceptible to a route. The rules take a bit to get your head around but the game is pretty well-supported with FAQs, etc.

It's like Magic: the Gathering, bu with dice! 
I'm not a huge fan of the Marvel theme, but I do like the combination of Yahtzee-style dice allocation combined with the similarities to Magic's combat and summoning system.  This set is pretty bare bones, though, even for an intro set. 
I do not complain about rulebooks often, but the one that game with this set was the pits: too much awkward phrasing and not enough visual aids.

Oh no! It happened again.. This is MtG, but possibly more fun.. As long as there isn't a power creep in the rare/ultra-rare department, this game has such a bright future ahead of itself.

edit: Not as big of a fan after several plays. Not enough game in a starter pack.

RATING: 8
The Dice Masters system is much better than you would expect, just give it some time.

Dice Masters is effectively Magic the Gathering meets Quarriors except with a much better theme. Since I cannot stand MTG and Quarriors looked stupid it took a discount copy of the Uncanny X-Men starter set for me to even try this.

Pros:
* This gets better the more you play it and the more cards you own.
* Getting duplicate cards from buying boosters is not as bad as other CCG since you likely need the additional dice.

Cons:
* There are no good cases to really store the game properly. Dice Master's Team boxes are about the best you are going to get, so while they are good for the cards they are just OK for the dice.

Positives:

Solid mechanics and a lot of fun to play. 
Box and card art is nice
SuperHero theme is a great addon
The dice components are generally fantastic.
Price point to start playing is excellent

Negatives

Booster pack cards are generally always warped. Though intend to try to flatten them for a few days - should sort them out.
Collectible game is collectible - only 1 of 4 super rare found in 90 packs in the gravity box with around a third of the rares still missing. For casual play, not really an issue as you can proxy cards. Might annoy me for tournament play (I admit to preferring the LCG model to CCG)
Dice quality, sometimes dice of the same set can be either discoloured or otherwise not quite identical to others. A little annoying at times.


I think this is a simple game to learn (and teach) which has a lot of complexity with the interactions of the various characters. It's also a lot of fun to play! It is a dice game, so randomness can be a factor. If you don't like being screwed by terrible luck with dice - then don't buy a dice game!

Overall, I'm very happy that I finally decided to jump in to Dice Masters and looking forward to many games of this in the future!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dice Masters is addictive. Very addictive. So be warned.
It's smart to think about what you want this game to be. Will you just play it casually with friends? Compete in (local) tournaments? Entertain your kids with some fast superhero action? 
The game's certainly able to play each of those roles well, but depending on your preferences it can become very expensive, very fast...

Since it's a collectable game, with different rarities, completionists may spend quite some money chasing every card in each set. The more casual players don't need to worry, though, as the abilities on many of the common and uncommon cards are as good (some even better) as many of the rares and super-rares.

The good thing about Dice Masters, is that is has a relatively small footprint. You can easily fit your team (dice and cards) in a dice bag and carry that around. Playtime is short, the game can be played in about half an hour and explained in about ten minutes. This means it can be played anywhere and anytime. Which is a big plus for a game, in my book.

You and your opponent will be building towards an attack that outsmarts the other side's defense, in order to deal damage to the other player and get to victory. Most of the time, this struggle for supremacy is an exciting battle of wits (with the occasional gamble). And though some team builds are able to beat others before the opponent even knows what's going on, you can easily remedy this when not playing competitively. Switch sides after a game, for example. Or play best-out-of-five.

Another fun aspect is the team building. I often find myself on the couch or at the table, cards spread out, pondering on a new build. There's so many ways to approach this aspect of the game: you can follow the competitive meta, trying how well you do with current 'top lists'; you can build thematic teams (Magneto leading the Brotherhood of Mutants, Professor X at the head of an X-Men team,...); take a Character you love and build a team supporting its ability;... So even when you're not playing, this game can still entertain you.

Dice Masters is one of those games that fits firmly in the easy to learn, hard to master-category. The basic framework of the rules is very straightforward, but the many different abilities and the synergies you can create while building your teams provide players with ample opportunity for experimentation.

After getting burnt buying gravity feeds and struggling to even complete the first set (Damn those SRs!), I found it much easier to purchase a complete set off eBay. 

Hey, let someone else do the hard work of cracking over the boosters and consolidating the cards. I'll just hand over the money. Plus a full set goes for less than the cost of two gravity feeds (from all accounts, you need at least 3 to 4 GRs to complete one set).

This is a Marvel collectible game, so this already appeals to me.  It's effectively MTG mixed with deck building, which is also interesting to me.  The variations in the characters and their abilities is appealing.  I like this game, but I have the major complaint that combat feels very different from MTG.  I feel like players get rewarded for mindlessly attacking to consistently deal damage, and defense/staying alive for passive abilities does not feel like a tractable tactic.  I tend to like deep endgames, but the game mechanics seem to discourage this.

More silly Dice Masters stuff. I can't honestly recommend the game as it's a pretty standard deck builder with the added randomness of each of your cards only working 75% of the time and the blind buy collectible nature, but to buy a bunch of commons online is a cheap and easy way to build a selection of cards and dice that can be played casually. It's clearly not a 'good' game, though it is oddly satisfying to play. Wizkids remain a shambles though for QC.

Update: Absolutely the best way to collect this game is to ignore Rare and Super Rare cards, buy a handful of boosters and the complete your sets online. 

I've also played quite a lot now and being able to put together a few sets to take and play against someone else who has done similar is quite entertaining, but it really has to be played in a light-hearted spirit.

Rating up from 6.5 to 7.5

Further update: The lack of clarity of rules and a seeming complete lack of an FAQ to mitigate the awful WizKids quality control killed off my interest in this game. Once it slips to an occasional game, you spend half your time debating how to interpret the rules on cards. Sold.

My low rating is based on Wizkids poor handling of the game and not the system itself. The gaming system and it's components have marvelous potential, but Wizkids really rushed this to market and only seem to care about money and not a fine tuned product or the community. Between broken cards, ill worded cards, printing errors that are not likely a result of the factory but of the proofs used to set the printings and a general "we don't give a fuck about clearing up any of our fuck-ups" attitude towards the gaming community this one is dead in the water for me. If they took the time to fine tune the rule set and get cards released with wording that did not require a plethora of rules lawyering that they seem not to want to involve themselves in I could easily up my rating to an 8 or 9 but sadly I do not see this happening.

Uhhh, this is fun. You get to control (individual) Marvel characters. Quick and easy and tons of replay-ability.

However, this game is a collectible card/dice game and you need to buy (lots) of booster packs to get the full experience. This is an absolute no go for me! If you want to create collectibles, get stickers with chewing-gum. Don't ruin games with buy-to-win mechanisms...

Bottom line - I have this nagging feeling of owning an incomplete game :(

Interesting pool building game, but I feel like I want to like it more that I actually do. The base mechanics and different dice are quite interesting, but with more and more cards (boosters) there is a lot to take in each game, especially considering the game's short play length. Also, the manual and card texts leave a lot to be desired in terms of wording, structure and lay out. The FAQ of this game will grow huge! All in all, certainly an improvement over Quarriors, but not what it could have been (more streamlined, less collectible and proof-read).

Added some fun changes to Quarriors, but the random acquire aspect as well as the game play failings that were not fixed even though this was at least the third time using the engine, make the game fall flat.

I like the dice masters system but the super hero theme is pretty tired. The collectable aspect is also a turn off.

The first expansion to Dice Masters, this includes some answers for a few of the over-played characters from the first set and more importantly, some avenues for ramping up resource generation so that the higher cost heroes can actually see play. I wouldn't say it's game changing, but it's a good start to opening up the Meta a bet.

This is as good as the hype. Select your army (ala Heroscape), build your deck (ala dominion) but it is dice rather than cards and then decide to attack your opponents or stand in defense waiting for the attack from your opponemts. 
Excellent. Must get some boosters! Lots of them. Awesome

RATING: 8
Simple game mechanics open to small collections/casual play or obsessive collecting/competitive play. Powerful common cards and dice variability totally allow for small collections that could have a shot in a tournament too, which I really like. Basically, don't stress out about what people say you "need" to have to enjoy this games. It's fun scaled up or down, lots of dice or just a few.

Easy enough to teach, but plenty of room for combos and strategy. Easy to combine different sets or play stand-alone.

It's a dice game. Ultimately you're just rolling dice and hoping the face you want comes up. The only influences you have is the ability to reroll once, choose when to attack, and choose which dice you buy. The dice you roll each turn are randomly selected from this you haven't rolled yet this round, making dice synergies more a matter of luck an skill.

After a while you realiz you're just rolling dice, not really making any tough or strategic decisions. Sure, you have to choose whether or not you attack this turn or next, save an energy to thwart your opponent with a global ability, or decide between summoning or buying, but the decisions really aren't that deep.

A starter each and a gravity feed between two was enough to get us going - swapping cards between the two of us. I ordered quite a few cards from the first set to add to the variety. I can foresee us playing this game quite a bit. It's fast like Magic and has a lot of variety and the random factor keeps one of us from steam rolling the other in too many consecutive games.

Rima picked up a bunch of D&D dice masters packs so I'm sure we'll have a cross-over battle soon

Cooled down on this one. I prefer card games.

I just don't get this game.  It seems like the game just plays itself... you role dice, try to put them up to battle... do some damage to opponent's dice or self and then wash, rinse repeat... just didn't seem like any interesting decisions were happening.

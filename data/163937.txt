Extremely light but fun game. Tutorial mode in the app pretty much teaches you everything making the board the only necessary part in the game box. There are a bunch of grammatical errors in the app that can make understanding it difficult at times. App really needs to include the location on the board when it gives you place names - as it is, a player aid that I've created (in the Files section) is almost essential. Not enough variety in the missions - most of them are "sail from place A to place B" or "sail to place A, then place B, then back to A". It'd be easy to add more variety and interactivity to the missions. The way the phone is used as your pawn, cards, and mission selection is neat and provides a nifty interactive augmented reality version of your space.

Backed on Kickstarter.

On first play we experienced very bad technical difficulties. Don't buy this before they have updated the app. 

...and when that happens, my rating will also go somewhere much higher.

Pretty, but lacking in substance.  This is really just a turn-based video game in which you've been forced to use a board as the map.  It falls short of making good use of either medium (electronic or tabletop).  Since the game exists almost entirely within the app there's the possibility they could revise it into something more meaningful.

A nice game. I'm not sure if there's a board game even though there's a game board. I wouldn't have minded even if it had came without the board and you'd had to explore and make the map while playing.

RATING: 7
Nice integration of technology into board game. I like how you have private information and public. Only reason that the game doesn't rank higher is that the implementation is slow; there are pockets of downtime (when other players can't be doing things because their phones have to be on the board so they can't examine their ships in private) and there are turns where you do nothing but move which is slightly bulky because of the app interaction. It would come around to a player who would just sail two places and that could take about 30 seconds (which to move a physical gamepiece should take about 3 seconds!)

The phone gimmick is not bad and helps to make this a very enjoyable game.  Not much to the game besides going from place to place and trying to attack each other, but that simplicity makes it easy to get into the game.  Also the random elements added by that app keep things from getting too boring, definitely a keeper for me.

So much potential. SO much. But dang is downtime killing it for me. The fast game is way too long as it is, and you don't get that many turns. When people go to port, I just sigh in despair because I got to sit and watch someone mess around on their phone. Your turn should just end when you go to port, so you can pick up your phone and do what you need to do and the next player can go ahead and go without waiting for you. That one, little fix would make this game 100 times better. But as it stands... I'll play it... and halfway through I'll probably regret I agreed to.

huge negative for requiring everyone to use smart phones to play.  Not everyone has them and I see major problems in putting a bunch of smart phones on a board like this.  Didn't bother with the contest because I think this is horrible and I'd not waste my time with a horrible idea like this.  It would be one thing to have it optional but to require it, on a board game, while you are there with the people face to face?  I don't think much thought was put into it.  Stupid gimmick.

Looks like a fun concept. What better way to organize chits and lots of secret information than storing it all on your phone. I also like that it has an autosave feature in case you need to stop your game. I don't normally quit games halfway through but if I didn't have to put things away or remember where every piece was on the board, I might use that feature more often. I could especially see it being useful when you are in the middle of a game and everybody has to pause while your one annoying friend goes off to leave comments on games they haven't played yet. You could just play a quick game right on top of the board for this one! I look forward to it!

When it works, it works. Had a minor goof up the first game, then it worked pretty well. A few times a move would register wrong and the direction of the board goofed me up in a game and actually put me in a better position (although that is my fault for not checking the coordinates before hitting the button). Makes pick up and deliver a bit easier for non-gamers and fire breathing sea dragons. Fun game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2016)

For some reason, I thought World of Yo-Ho was released at the same time (or very near) that Alchemists (2014) and XCOM: The Board Game (2015) but I now see it is a 2016 release. I bought the game without knowing anything about it (as is usual from me). Had I known it was a pirate themed game I wouldn’t have bought it as I really dislike that theme, however I enjoyed it ;).

The rules are very easy to learn and teach. You can do it under 8 minutes. Iello usually does great art and there is no exception here, the art of World of Yo-Ho is very good. There are few game components within the box, only the map, a rulebook (I think) and the player´s standees, everything else is handled by the app. The app works perfectly, it handles all aspects of the game so you don’t have to. It handles all the scoring, random events, your moves and the secret information. If anything, I wish it had an undo functionality, at first I made some mistakes while I was familiarizing myself with the UI, but this is a very minor issue. I love that you can only see the current score when you are in a port :D.

The game decisions are very simple (where to move?, what weapons to buy?, which mission to accept?, who to attack?), World of Yo-Ho has a light-medium weight. The idea is to accomplish mission to obtain money and VPS. The missions usually involve search for something, pick up and deliver, or to attack someone and some of them have a time limit (that the app handles).

Other advantages of playing with the app are:

•	Short setup and teardown.
•	I particularly like that your phone becomes your ship, when you battle with another players the screens show the fight and it is interesting and novel.

By the way, you only need one device to play the game, but it is much better when each player has his own smartphone.

On the bad side, I feel the game would be too simple for me without the app, that is, I feel there is not a lot of game in the box and what keeps the game interesting is the app itself. When a player gets to a port, the downtime is excessive, I wish the app would allow the next player to begin his turn. 
 
Bottom line, I like the game but just barely. My desire to play it is normal and I would play again if requested, however it is way too light for me, so I already sold my copy of the game. Without the iPhone I’m not sure if the game would be interesting enough for me. It is, unquestionable, a novel and unique game. It can be a great family game, perhaps it is the best pirate themed game I have played (although I also like Libertalia).

I've only played this game once so far and I really enjoy it! The combination collision of tech and boardgame come together in quite the interactive game! You just need two items 1) the boardgame and 2) the boat, which just so happens to take the shape of your mobile device! In this game you simply try to complete as many missions as possible to gain points before your opponent reaches the set amount of points you both decide on at the start of the game! Be careful though, ye don't want to be goin' flirtin' around in enemy waters lad, or ye might just get ye self in a battle and sink to davey jones locker!

Gorgeous map art for the playing board. Played twice, then sold my copy. Interesting to play at least once, but not very exciting for the long run. Best with everyone having their own smart phone to use as their ship, but game can be played with one phone if you do pass and play. Integrated app is well done and the sound effects add to the experience.

At first glance this might look like a gimmick, and if you can get over the fact that you don't get a great deal in the box, you'll find this to be a really fun and entertaining game. The pirate feel is captured brilliantly as you use your phone to sail a massive board, competing with other players to reach a target amount of loot, the more players you have the more cutthroat it is.Easy to learn and appealing to video gamers as well as board gamers.

Very interesting Pirate game that comes with an APP that you need a smart phone to play the game with (which I don't have, so I am not as keen to get this game as I am to try it out first)

Still, the concept is really interesting and the reviews say it is ahead of its time with regards to APP integration

I essentially had to try this because I always want to encourage new ideas for ways to evolve gaming. Essentially, rather than being a board game with an app. This is really a video game that happens to come with a physical board. This is a great family weight game that takes seconds to setup (if you don't count downloading the huge app in advance) and only a few minutes to teach. You don't even really need to teach it yourself as the app comes with a really good tutorial (although this tutorial will slow up your first play). This is essential a pick-up and deliver sandbox game in the same vein as Firefly. Except it's a little lighter in terms of missions and you  don't have to manage a crew. It does, however, actually have a more in-depth combat system (essential a mini rock-paper-scissors card battle game). Going to port can take a little long, but the rest of the game moves fast and is a great way to get people stuck to their phones to consider board games. Long term I think it needs more variety of game modes to stay fresh, but for now it's a great game to have.

Simple? Yeah.  Gimmicky? Perhaps.  Fun? Most definitely! This game gives me hope for the future of app integration in the hobby.  At this point it would really only take a simple sci-fi retheme (space ships or giant robots) to drive this one up to a 9 for me.  Galaxy of Yo-Ho, anyone?

The fantastic technology  in "World of Yo-Ho" doesn't undermine or replace the  traditional board game experience, instead truly enhancing it. This is the best implementation of a software application since "Alchemists" and it really elevates the light-weight explore-collect-battle game-play.

Unfortunately, the hidden information aspect of the game constantly has players picking their phone(s) up off the game board, reading something, choosing an option, and putting it back down. It leads to a lot of down time during which the other players have nothing to do. 

The random nature of the game means that planning your turn ahead of time isn't really an option because you just don't know what's going to happen. 

Because of those two negative aspects sometimes "World of Yo-Ho" can overstay it's welcome. Still, this is a game I think everyone should play.

My rating is based on my three plays of the game.  I know a lot of the previous negative comments are based on the fact that people were having problems with the app crashing and bugs, etc.  I bought into the game late and have the newer, more updated version which has resolved a lot of the initial issues.

The game is designed to be light and fun, and that is exactly what it does, which is why I rate it so highly. Some people call the use of the app a "gimmick". but it provides me with so much amusement, that I feel like I am going to be enjoying this game for along time to come.

pick up and deliver game, basically just a more interesting twist on Firefly.
Interesting to see the game working with the app, but I won't stick to it, just not my game.
You sail around the map with the cellphone as your ship and collect tasks in different harbours. Then you set sail and try to fulfill those in a simple pick up and deliver mechanism. 
Huge plus factors are the fights and the monsters that can appear sometimes. 
If you like those games, this is a good one, very well made.

RATING: 8
This is a really great game for all ages / Family Games. You need some patience to work through what will be a slow first game to learn the interface and where the different board locations are, but after your second game it will all flow really well. 

The lack of a hand of cards (all managed on the phone) requires a bit more thinking during your turn, and a bit more memory work to feel your way through decisions about how long you can last before you need to repair your ship.

For your best intro, do just a 400pt game first time, with just one person showing the tutorial cues. Play each turn 'open hand' so everyone can learn from your turn at the same time. This way you'll get everyone on board (no pun!) with the controls and play.

Fun, light game. Beautifully done, quality components. The mechanic of needing to use your phone, wifi, and a (free) app is novel, but also adds greatly to the game beyond just the "wow factor".

I have two observations... 1. There is too much downtime while in Ports, etc. It would streamline things if the game could move on while one player is in a Port. 2. There's not much player interaction with only two players. I imagine that with 4 players, it would be more hectic.

Very much enjoy the game. It's light, pirate-y fun!

It's pretty fun, and no need to worry about swimming through fiddly bits. The app keeps track of all accounting. And the graphics are neat. The game play is enjoyable too, better with 3 or 4. 

My one complaint is the app functionality. There is no "Go-Back" function, which is especially annoying in a game where a player can make two moves in a turn. I understand that once the turn is over, but there were many times where I couldn't undo things or check if I could do alternative choices, before finalizing my turn. The one way to do it was to go to home screen on the phone, because it automatically "disconnects" from the game, and resets to the beginning of the the current players turn. It shouldn't be that complicated. But that's a kink and bug I'm sure can be worked out for updates to the app.

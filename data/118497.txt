5 plays (+1 intro play) / 5 players

LIKE: A deep game within a small package. I like the trick taking for command of placing an engine to maximize points. Unique game, plays very quick.
DISLIKE: The strategy can be opaque. Each round was unforgiving, yet the game is short. I wish there were a way to have a longer game with higher player counts.

OVERALL: The game is ok, but sometimes the decisions seem random, especially with 5 players. Needs many plays before the subtleties emerge. Numerical analysis on when the engines are beneficial should be pointed out to new players.

1st play: Unique trick-taking stock market game with trains as a theme.  There's a tough balancing act between using your good cards to win tricks at just the right time vs using them as track cards.  No easy decisions and plays very quickly.

2nd play: Competing priorities and how to balance when to win (if you're able to) vs when to throw a round in order to add to specific stock.  My main frustration with this (and all trick taking games) is that because you have to follow a lead-suit, often times there aren't a lot of ways to make meaningful decisions.  Still, a unique trick taking game that isn't bad.

Delightfully interesting trick taking game. Takes a simple trick taking mechanic and uses it to drive an intriguing stock holding and rail company valuation mechanic.

Every other turn you're either adding potential value to the companies or adding stock in front of you with the cards played--and the winner of the trick will either receive a special stock instead of the one played or add a train to the companies to determine how their value will be decided. Certainly swung a bit by luck being a card game/trick taker. But it's such a cool idea done in an interesting way.

A strange and original concept - combining railway game route building, locos and shares with a trick taking card game.  It's a really clever piece of design that brings a flavour of all these things in a deck of just 71 cards.  

However, like others I wonder how much of a game there is here.  In the early tricks you have barely any information about the likely value of each company on which to base decisions.  So you void your hand of low value cards and wait.  Winning tricks in the late game is critical to winning the game.  So I suspect the only significant question that this game asks is: do I have the high value cards to win those late tricks and manipulate the placement of locos and acquisition of late shares to my advantage?  

The design of the cards is clear and functional, the pictures of locos are quite nice.  Card quality is reasonable.  The rules are an easy read.  There was just an unanswered question in our minds about the order in which losing cards are added to extend a route.

An interesting combination of trick-taking and share accumulation, where winning tricks is not necessarily a good thing.  It seemed the luck/skill balance was too much on the luck side, but maybe I need to play it more.  Good for a filler.

Interesting game.  Played with 3 and 4 players.  I think I prefer the 3 player version just because you get all three cities into play and the game is a little longer.  Sometimes feels like the game is playing you.  However, my one buddy won 3 of the 4 games we played and he said that he was figuring it out, so there must be some deduction going on.  Myself, I finished all 4 games dead last, so I must have much to learn.  I have a feeling this will get to the table again soon, so will update if we get more plays in.

Trick of the Rails combines a traditional trick taking mechanic with a simple 18XX portfolio management mechanic.  This is an odd but intriguing mash up. Strategy is unorthodox and subtle (a combination that has led some to suggest this game is too random).  I'm having a lot of fun with this one right now.

Interesting dynamic where winning a trick isn't always in a player's best interest immediately but may set them up to win the next couple of tricks that helps them.

RATING: 4
Maybe the five player game is just very poor, but while there are some interesting ideas here, the game just plain didn't work very well.

Basically, in Trick of the Rails, you are playing tricks in order to build track for rail companies to increase their value, and to build up stock in those companies, hoping to acquire stock in the most valuable companies at the end of the round.

However, the standard "must follow lead suit of possible" rule in trick taking games really presents an issue to this design.

For example, one type of trick in this game requires all players to build the cards played to a trick as rail.  If someone leads red for the first trick, odds are that everyone will have a red card and thus will have to follow suit.  No one has a choice, and the result is that red will immediately be building a bunch of track, which is odd from a game play perspective.  There is also another type of trick where everyone gets their played card as a share, which presents the same issue.  If red is led, odds are everyone will end up with a share of red.  Weird.

Overall, there are the cool beginnings of a system here that puts a twist on standard trick-taking, but I feel like it still needs quite a bit more development.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

Okay so like... the rulesheet here is terrible. We didn't really understand scoring until AFTER we had played the game... and even then there are still a lot of bits that are muggy. This would literally all be solved if there was just at least one example of scoring a track in the rules. Seriously.

So that confusion marred the whole first play for me. I dig the choice point of trying to get cards into your pile o' stocks vs. laying some rails, though.

But it seems like it's too easy to screw yourself into voiding the suits you want early, then not being able to make any kind of useful plays later? To be honest we spent so much time parsing the rules during the first half of the game that I'm not even aware of how much control I had over my fate, here.

DEFINITELY a tentative rating.

RATING: 4
I didn't see a lot of scope for clever card play, which will always be a requirement for me in a trick taking game. I am sure there is subtlety in the gaining of shares and timing and rhythm of the game, but I thought basic strategy was obvious enough that luck of the draw would be more determinative than you would want in a game like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A trick taking game with a lot of fluff layered onto it. It feels like you may have some interesting decisions, but for the most part the hands still play themselves and the stocks and railways don't seem to offer many feel good tactical plays. It becomes too long for what it really is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A trick taking game where you either do a trick to gain shares in a railroad company or add a locomotive and rails to the railroad company which is how the value of each company is determined for end of game. The unfortunate thing in our play is that all railroad companies but 1 had the same value at the end so we ended up with 4 people tied for the win. Maybe another play will let me see a bit more of how to influence a company's value better, but only being able to gain a share in a company or add a locomotive to a company once in the game just felt too constrained with how balanced the scoring was.

One first play, a very generous 8. Unlikely to go up, this would have been a 7 but for the fact that it is so brief. I like trick taking games. I like train and shares games. This is a good fit. It is quirky and fun and quick with quite a bit to manage for such a little package.

Origins 2016 in prototype form. There is an interesting mechanism, but it was taught to us as a one-round game which makes very little sense in this context. Played over several rounds with collected score, it would be an ok game. As a one-shot, single-hand game, it isn't worth your time.

I feel like there is a fair amount of undiscovered depth to this game, but so far players have been stuck in the mindset of winning the trick, instead of playing the Trick Lane trick tactically. But unsure how to do this (beyond off-suiting) when having to follow suit takes away some control? (November 2016)

After three separate plays I can say that I STILL don't have the hang of this game yet, but it's intriguing. I enjoy the quirkiness of it and have watched as two different strategies won the day in two different games. Lots of fun, and short enough that I don't mind any randomness.

RATING: 7
Weird little combo of trick taking game and 18XX-ish. The game, while straight forward once you've wrapped your head around the rules, isn't easy to understand at first. Some may find that for a trick taking type of game, there seems to be a lack of control, but this may not be the case. While having control of the tricks may be key, i suspect that you might be able to score well by timing what card you play, even to a losing trick.
Also, since a hand can be played quite quickly once the players understand the flow of the game, it's probably better to play to 100 to 200 points rather than playing single hands as the rules suggest since that would help level off the luck of the draw.
A quick note about the quality of the cards: pretty enough, but the cardstock used is quite thin and will probably not stand up to repeated play.

This is, as many people have observed, a puzzling game.  For me, it's quite enjoyable.  I'd love to play it a few more times.  It has an astounding amount of thematic fidelity considering that it's an 1830 trick-taking game!

After several plays, I still don't understand the best strategy in the game or even kind of wonder if there is a best strategy. I like TotR but victories can often come down to a trick won here or an engine laid there. It's quick enough so that a win or loss doesn't really matter all that much but the game does feel random.

Update: I still find this game difficult to parse but I am slowly starting to uncover how the trick-taking element plays into the strategy of the game. I've played at all player counts now and I think I prefer 3 best, 4 second best, & 5 least.

RATING: 5
Trick of the Rails is a trick-taking game with a train theme. The concepts of following suit, winner of the trick leads, etc. are all here, though there is no bidding and no trump. 

The winner of each trick receives either a stock/share in one of the five suits, or the ability to make that suit worth more points per share at the end. However, the players who lose the trick all receive those same benefits, so there is often little advantage to having the lead. All players will finish the game with the same number of shares, the only question will be the distribution of those shares. 

With 5 different suits of slightly varying values and 4 different players all nudging those values in different directions, it felt very chaotic. I could possibly see this working better as a partnership game, but even then I'm not sure. It's not that the hands play themselves; the players really do have decisions to make. The problem is the implications of those decisions, especially in the early hands, are very unclear and capricious. 

There is a lot of fiddling about with the placement of tracks, which locomotive goes where, and which stock to take, all of which often result in minimal differences in score. But there is no solution here. Widening the score variance of each suit would only create more randomness and yet being as close as they are makes the choices feel both meaningless and random. I think you'd be better of just playing a simple trick-taking game with a deck of cards. The extra rules overhead here doesn't add any more strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really neat game with obtuse scoring mechanisms that, while a trick-taking game, doesn't feel like a regular one at all. Nicely brings in 18XX-style alternating stock & operating rounds - and it's a bit of a shame the rules don't officially use those names for them, as it would make what is going on a little clearer.

RATING: 7
One of the cooler uses of trick taking. I like that hand assessment runs on a few different axes. Specifically, you are trying to figure out which cards in your hand you want as stock, and which you want to lay as track on the board. There's also a sub-game based around deciding when you want to win a trick, and when you want to "lose" so that you can take a card as stock instead.

The decisions are interesting, but I'm slightly concerned that sometimes a hand will play itself. You can end up in situations where you have a rainbow hand of low to mid value cards, and in those cases you largely just follow suit and don't direct much action. You can wiggle a bit by playing cards to either end of the track, or deciding which of your cards in suit to take as stock, but it's largely automatic. This issue seems particularly exacerbated at higher player counts, five being a specifically bad example. With nine tricks to play, you really don't get to make many choices unless you have some nines or tens.

For now, I'll leave it at a seven. It's intriguing, but 
 there seem to be some weak points that could get worse with more play. I'm going to stick at three and four players for a while, and see if I still like it after five to ten more rounds.

After two plays, I love the ideas at work in this game but am not at all sure how to exert significant control over how it plays out. Could just be me, though -- often it takes a bit for a trick-taker to "click." Unfortunately the card quality and art/design are so bad that I think I would rather have an Artscow version, or even paste up standard playing cards.

Trick taking games are not really my thing, so 6 means I actually rate this game quite well as an example of its type.  Trick of the Rails provides many non-obvious decision points at which to (attempt to) take or duck tricks.  Like all trick taking games it is vulnerable to draw luck and requires multiple hands to really get the full experience.

This game is incredibly unique and fun to play; I would play this anytime! Excellent!

RATING: 4
I'm beginning to think it is folly to try transforming 18xx-style games into a card game format. In Trick of the Rails players play a no-trump, no trick-taking card game where cards played alternately add shares to players' portfolios and also develop track lines to shape the value of each share at game's end. Locomotive cards assigned to track lines by the trick winner have the largest influence on the relative worth of a share.

So what's wrong with it? Since you don't take any tricks - you are playing a trick to play a card from the "trick line", not to take anything - it is a complete whiff as a trick-taker. Because your portfolio will mostly consist of cards from your hand, you are mostly stuck with what you are dealt. In the end, somebody wins, but it's hard to go back through the game to figure out how or why.

I don't know what to make out of this. I read before that there's not enough influence at higher player counts so I tried it with only three players. Our game ended 240:240:240. Especially towards the end it suffered from players getting played as there's no escape from serving the trick if you can, i.e. no trumps. 
The feat of this game seems to be that nobody can answer if there's any influence at all or if it is a crapshoot. It's short enough that I will continue the quest to find out and it gets bonus points for combining trick-taking with 18xx.

The optimal strategy for this game is not at all clear and after a few plays I cant decide if that is because I need more time to figure it out (some strategic elements have become clear, but I cant wrap my head all the way around it) or if it is because there really isn't an optimal strategy at all. Definitely a hard game to figure out the optimal move in many scenarios. 

Either way, feels very fun to play, I like buying stock in the trains and then trying to upgrade those trains and the scoring at the end is fun. I have a blast playing it even if I don't fully understand what i'm supposed to be doing.

A pretty fresh take on trick taking mixing a share collection mechanism into a simple card game, making it a lot deeper in the process. Lots of thought to be put into when to win a trick and with which card to lose one.

Reactions were universally good.  I like how your goal for any given trick may not be to win the trick, but instead play a losing card to improve your share position.  I am curious to play more and see what other tactics there are to be employed during the game.

This game made no sense at all, with players mostly making zero decisions due to being forced to play the only card they can. I'm guessing this is because we played with 5 and the game is probably better with smaller number of players.

I like the idea of a trick taking train game. The problem is that it is badly implemented.

Very convoluted and confusing. Sometimes you want to win, sometimes you want to lose. For each trick, the cards does not go at the same place all the time making it even more confusing.

Personally, I would have done something more straight forward where winning tricks gives you shares and gives you money to operate the matching company for the round.

I enjoyed my second play a bit more as I understood the game a bit more. I do think several rounds need to be played to even out the luck of the deal just like most trick taking games. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

While I am still trying to decide how much control one actually has in this game, there are some decisions mostly of a tactical nature that can be interesting.  Still need to play more to really figure out my thoughts on this one.  Rules are straightforward and play is fairly quick.

What a brilliant design! This is a trick-taking games where players use the cards played on the tricks to invest in and develop railroads, so that the final score is based on "net worth" (how many shares you have on each railroad and what is their final value depending on how they developed). Outstanding with 3 players, still interesting with 4, but too chaotic with 5.

This is probably a great game if you repeatedly play it with the same group very often. If you only play it 5 to 10 times, you still feel like you have no real idea how to play well. You understand what to do to achieve which result and stuff, but how to play well remains quite obscure. Does NOT include nuclear rail tanks.

Interesting and original little train game. You need to play a game first to fully understand what is all going on. It plays quickly, so time for another go. As with any trick taking game, high cards help. With low cards, you're at mercy of what the others allow you to score. Not so good with five. Interesting little game, good for some more plays.

Have had a couple of playthroughs and feel underwhelmed by this one. First, it takes a lot of table space in an awkward format (laying down a long line of cards, plus 5 extensible rows, plus having a spot for putting trains next to the rails). Second, both games felt like they were won or lost virtually randomly--in one case, a player who clearly didn't even understand the rules won by a huge margin simply by getting 2 stocks by accident in the most valuable railway. That randomness would surely decrease once everyone got more accustomed to the game and the very unintuitive play ("uh, this is a share? But I add this to the rail? And I swap this card in the rail?").... but I have to wonder why play this when you could just play a regular, less awkward trick-taking card game.

The cards are fine, by the way, so ignore the fuss over the failure to provide the linen gloss. Everything looks quite nice. But the mini pencil included in my copy fell apart the first time I tried to use it.

RATING: 5
Interesting combination of trick-taking and stocks that comes together surprisingly well. Unfortunately, I don't know that the game has enough going on to make this combination any more than just a cool idea. Each game consists of a single round, which doesn't bother me as I tend to like shorter trick-taking games, and the variance in cards is exceedingly low. The cards you play typically go into your stock portfolio, while the winner usually takes the card currently on offer. It all works, but there isn't much variation from game to game. I'd like to see this idea re-implemented with more of an Acquire setting versus an 18xx one. I think that would make for a slightly better combination.

I think I'd rather just play 18xx. No, I take that back.

This is an OK trick-taking game, and it does capture some of the basic ideas of 18xx in a much, much lighter/faster game. I didn't feel like I had much control at all though (I was dealt a "rainbow" hand), and other trick-taking games are better than this because multiple hands are dealt to even out the bad hand luck. In this, you get one hand and it's over. Also, as usual, the train theme does nothing for me.

Hey, guess what? TRICK-TAKING! But this time it's mixed with the portfolio management of an 18xx game.

A very strange trick taking game, you play not to win tricks but to get shares in train companies (like all 18XX games) and expand the trail tracks for the companies you won shares in to maximize the value of your shares. It is very hard to control as you don't want to win but create situations where your companies are expanded while at the same time gaining shares of said companies but this is not always possible. After two games I am still on the fence for this one.

Trick of the Rails is a trick-taking card game whose primary scoring mechanic is stock-holding.  I have to admit, this game didn't really click with me at all.  In the early rounds, it seemed not to matter what you do, because you have no idea what stocks would be valuable in the end, nor do you know what stocks you'll be able to get. In the later rounds, the "follow-suit" mechanism meant that you mostly don't have any choices at all. Basically, you do stuff, and then stuff happened. I don't get it.

Interesting card game about gaining shares and developing rail companies. It has gone some nice decisions with some simple deduction involved. The game alternates between a stock round and a track laying round. Stock round allows players to gain shares in a rail company and track laying round allows players to develop rail companies they are/going to be invested in.

I don't have a history of playing trick taking games, but this game left me completely flat. My hand contained only low and middle numbers, so I think I got to make one real choice throughout the entirety of the game. The essence is that one player starts by playing a card. Everyone else then has to play a card of that color if they have one. Then whoever played the highest numbered card of the correct color gets to take a bonus card being bid on. These cards get assigned to trains, or put into your stock tableau where they score at the end based on how valuable the train got. This didn't connect with me at all.

What are they putting in the water in Japan? Hisashi Hayashi adds trick-taking to the list of things he's mashed up with train games, after deck-building (Trains) and dexterity (String Railway). This is one of those games that every time I teach it, someone remarks a couple of minutes in "Wow, this is so clever!" and I love the way it seamlessly blends the idioms of trick-taking and 18XX. After five plays, I'm still not sure how much control I have over the outcome, but I'm hoping to have a lot of fun figuring it out.

UPDATE: Gave this game away. The game is just not that strategically or tactically interesting compared to other trick taking games. The only time you have a significant decision to make is when you have the lead. Because of the nature of this game, there's a big chance you'll never get the lead, ever.

================

UPDATE: After playing two 5 player games, raised this from 6.5 to 7.

Once players figure out how the game works, it becomes a relatively lightweight trick taking game.

==========================

The trick taking mechanism in this game gets in the way of the game's clever distillation of an 18xx game.

The clever part: The game reminds me of [thing=75358][/thing]: You have one resource that represents both shares and tracks/income. In TofR, cards represent both stocks and tracks. If more cards are used as tracks, then there are less stocks to go around, and vice versa.

When cards are played as track, they are played in one row per corporation. However, each corporation is assigned one locomotive. This locomotive determines how many consecutive track cards a corporation may use. However, the bigger the locomotive, the more expensive it is! In some cases, the locomotive could cost more than the value of the track!

The not-so-clever part: However, cards are used also for trick taking purposes. In this game, winning a trick gives certain advantages:
(a) Determine who gets the lead for the next trick, which is important because
(b) Depending on the trick, the lead player picks which corporation/suit will be played as tracks or played as stocks.

To clarify, during each trick, there is always one card that will be awarded to the winner of the trick. (Note that each suit in the deck corresponds to a corporation and can represent either one share of that corporation or one track for that corporation.) If the card to be won is a share, then the player who wins the trick wins the share and loses the card with which he or she won the trick. All other players keep the card that they played face up in front of them as a share! Similarly, if the card to be won is a city card or a locomotive, all cards played to the trick will be used as track. 

This part, (b), is so counter-intuitive from the point-of-view of train games. Imagine being forced to build track for or buy shares in a certain corporation! 

I'm still very undecided whether or not I like how this game mashed up trick taking and train games together.

Unlikely to get a rating from me, as frankly it's unlikely I'll ever be able to get it to the table, however I can say from my tinkering around with it solo (test gaming), that this is a pretty interesting system. It's an odd fit though, as although the primary mechanic is trick taking, it's more likely to appeal to people interested in stock holding and/or train games. However at the same time, the level of randomness involved is likely to turn off the more hardcore fans of those genres (for those interested in a more "serious" stock holding card game, check out Rolling Stock). For what it is though I think this holds a lot of promise, which hopefully I'll get a chance to find out at an actual table sometime soon.

Played once with 4P. One of the more peculiar trick-taking games out there which takes a few turns to wrap the mind around. The consequence of each round is predetermined by the round's "prize", so players will either get to increase their shares or lay tracks. And while there are no trumps here, consistently winning tricks may not be a good thing. As a number of cards are randomly excluded from each game, it can be quite difficult knowing how well you are doing until towards the end.

Nice idea for a trick taking game.  I like the incorporation of the theme.

Unfortunately, this game bleeds with forced suits. While it may be acceptable to lose a couple tricks in a standard trick-taking game, I feel that because each trick yields such specific results, forcing suits mean that you frequently won't have the opportunity to play toward what you want. It's a quick card game, so whatever, but it feels like there is a missed opportunity in the design.

Lots of interesting decisions in this game: which cards to use for stock, which to try to get on the board, when you want to take a trick, etc.  Probably best with three players; the more players the more chaos. Not a very intuitive game to learn so play at least two hands in a row before deciding if it is for you.

Clever 1830-themed trick-taking game with 5 suits representing railroad companies. Tricks are played in alternating stock and operating rounds: in a stock round, each player ends up with one card as a share (usually the card they played); in an operating round, cards work to increase the value of shares at game end.

It feels thinkier than many trick-taking games because concerns about which tricks to attempt to win are also informed by the fact that it can be better to lose a round if you are short-suited and can choose which share to take or railroad to extend.

I suspect that it's a little too overwrought for the actual degree of player control, but it's terribly clever and definitely worth keeping as an occasional filler.

I love trick-taking games and 18xx, but not this card game -- at least not yet. As a trick-taking game player, there just doesn't seem to be much here.

I need additional plays to find out if I'm off base or dead on.

As a big fan of trick-taking games, I didn't like this one so much.

For all of its complexities, the winner feels like they got a couple of lucky breaks instead of winning by clever play. Players stay relatively even during the game because each player gets to claim stock and place track at an even rate, but near the end of the game someone can make a move to take the lead if they get lucky.

This is a really interesting game, build around simple trick-taking mechanics. The twist comes with every card played becoming either a share or a segment of one of the five railways.  Locomotives are also assigned to each railroad and both have a cost that counts against value as well as dictating how many segments can be included in the final value.

At the end of the game everyone has the same number of shares, and it's not clear that winning lots of tricks is even a good idea, let alone a winning strategy. For 25 minutes, this is an awesome game.

[u]Update:[/u]Incredible. Unique to card play. A brilliant design.  Has the nuanced psychology of shared incentives in a trick taking environment. 3-player only.

[U]Update: Oct 2013[/u] This is the real deal, bumped to a '9.' An ambitious idea executed really well, a trick taker that demands the nuanced sensitivity of a shares game. And it plays out in a gorgeous arc. Amazing. My three player games were excellent. Requires a receptive stance I can't quite explain.

[u]Update:[/u] It's still opague after 4 plays, but 4 plays isn't much. This could be a '10,' dunno.

I just can't tell if I'm stumped & experience would get me to see good play or if in the end a trick taking game without a trump to manipulate just makes the game (in the end) a strange complex bastard that is really just a tease, one of those magician's finger traps.

It's like reading a poem & there's a metaphor that gets under your skin, but you really don't know what it means, and it refuses to be reduced so you can figure it out. Maybe it doesn't mean anything! Maybe it's a tautology! Drives me apeshit. I stand there stupid, frozen, blinking.

[u]Orig comment:[/u]

It is a game begging to be hacked. There're some sort of mathematical matrix in there that suggests devilish intricacy and dares you to sort it out.

Needs to be played a few times to get it, not a one off game. This rating could go up quite a bit.

It's an interesting design feat, taking the Stock Round/Operating Round structure of an 18XX game and building a card game around it. The game doesn't quite feel like a traditional trick-taker, since winning a trick doesn't ensure you take the cards that others play. Rather, it's a hand-management game where you try to anticipate which cards in your hand would be better as company revenue, or as stocks in those companies. I like how this thought process changes over the course of the game, depending on how company routes and players' stock portfolios form. I'll have to play it more to decide how much control you can have given your initial cards, but I'm enjoying it so far.

I'm not quite sure yet if this is a game that requires a lot of thinking and careful analysis, or if it's just a game where you play your best card each round and hope for the best.  I won both games played so far, so I'm inclined to think it's the latter.

I like it so far, and I think it's neat the way the designer balanced the suit values with the railway values, and how you have to manage your hand based on where the cards are going to go with each trick.  I also like how you're managing a portfolio of stocks at the same time.  It's clever, and interesting, but I do wonder if this is as deep as I think it is.  I definitely want to play it more.

RATING: 7
I'm not hugely familiar with the vast universe of trick-taking games. I have played them occasionally and know how they work, but I haven't had enough experience to really "get" the strategies. That being said, I was able to dive right into Trick on the Rails and play fairly competently even during that first game.

The game is themed around the 18xx style game genre. It does a surprisingly good job of drawing on that theme and squeezes rail laying, stock acquisition, city connecting and engine investing into its various tricks. While the game has a very simple structure, throwing the right cards when managing your hand is a heady endeavor. Each trick has a different prize for the player who wins it, but the losing cards also provide a reward for the players that don't.

For instance, when a share is up for bid and all players have followed suit, the losing cards go back to their owners as shares in the various rail road companies. (The rail road companies are the card suits, which I had forgotten to mention.) In another trick, players may be gunning for a city card, which provides a big boost to the share value of the train company to which you attach. The winner picks which company gets it (presumably one in which they have a lot of shares) while the losers attach their played cards to the railroad of the matching suit, extending the value (or tanking it, in certain situations).

In other words, sometimes you want to intentionally lose. Other times you can't win, but you can strengthen your position by wisely investing the right card toss in the loss. The absence of an actual trump suit mechanism seems a little strange at first, but I think that allows a little more control for players, since losing tricks is often such an important pursuit.

Like any card game it's swingy on the card draws, but it plays super fast so even a bad deal is over before you have time to really stew in it. You can easily knock out a game in 20 minutes, so whatever concerns I might have about its chaotic nature are easily dismissed by just playing again.

An interesting game that deserves another play or two.  I'm not sure that the trick taking part of the game doesn't overwhelm the rest of the game, but we'll see.

While the rules are simple enough to understand, gameplay was rather uninspiring. It may be down to the fact that the game is not scalable at all and should be played only at a specific player count. Player interaction is mainly via the trick-taking, and has a strange feel to it. Artwork and game component quality is ok.

What a glorious trick taking game! This immediately became one of my favorites of that category of card games. Balancing winning tricks, and controlling the tempo of the game versus earning stock, and increasing a company's value is such a fun dilemma.

What a weird trick taking game.  Its actually really interesting trying to either get the shares you want or develop your favorite companies in alternating rounds... but like all trick taking games you are very reliant on the cards you are dealt to do that.  This also seems to be a very difficult game to explain as the concept really is very unique.  I got it right away but the other three new players felt pretty lost until end game scoring.  I'd play again if offered as there are some interesting things going on... but I certainly don't need a copy in my collection.

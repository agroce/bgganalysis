Initial Impression: Plaid Hat Games has knocked it out of the park with this game. The production value is of the highest level, with thick cardboard components and beautifully illustrated rule book. However, the miniatures are what set this game apart from most other tactical miniatures games. The bird sculpts are simply amazingly detailed and scream to be painted. The flight stands are sturdy and ball-socket mounting system is brilliant. Components aside, I'm highly impressed with the gameplay. The mechanisms are simple yet allow for serious tactical decisions. Catchup mechanisms result in a tense skirmish until the very end. The theme really shines through in the game, with banking birds and floating leaves. It certainly feels how I imagine a skirmish in the forest would be. Best of all, my son loves the game and is asking me to play it again.

This should have been a much bigger hit. The product value is off the charts and the gameplay is absolutely fun. If you're interested in an aerial combat game but don't have the time, energy, or money for something crazy like XWing this is exactly the 'all you need in one box' experience you're looking for.

Love every part of this game. This was my most anticipated game ever. It's absolutely up my alley. The theme is so strong. The story is tight the mechanisms can be as simple as you want or you can add in the advanced rules and tailor it to your play style.  Being able to use my older mice and Mystics mini's makes this game a great value!

This game has everything I hoped for and therefore it became one of my favourites. Its a complete miniatures game in one box. The components are beautiful and great quality. Very fun to paint, even for beginners. I Highly recommend to throw the Mice & Mystics figures into the mix to guarantee sheer endless variety. A the moment I write this you can buy them online seperatly from the Plaid Hat store.

RATING: 7
This is a tentative 7 based on the first scenario.  Like all campaign games, I'm sure it will shine if played through the campaign, so the below is more about the system itself.

First off, let's get the elephant addressed - the sculpts are god damned beautiful.  There is a wonderful world presented to you through the minis alone and thankfully, the accompanying prose in the scenario booklet isn't fan-fic crap and instead decently-written fantasy fluff.  I like it a lot.  But even without the prose, if you just set the game up, it promises a story, and that's pretty amazing considering other mini-centric games.  You immediately know that there is something about to go down on the table and that rodents are riding birds and brooding in trees, waiting for it to start.  It's quite a sight to behold.

So the system, then, is a little less... er... elegant in comparison.  At a high level, it does its job rather well, though perhaps not necessarily intuitively (but hey, I play wargames, so intuitive play isn't a requirement).  I like the idea that ground forces are abstracted, giving the idea that the flight-fights are taking place way up by the canopy and anyone sent out on a mission is way down below, out of sight.  I also don't like this idea because you have just so many of them and surely there would be tangles down on the ground, but that's nitpicking.

At any rate, the reason you come to this game is the aerial combat, right?  That's what people are immediately going to see, and we envision swooping and zipping and feathers flying everywhere!  Instead, what you get is a functional, yet not-quite-evocative system based on chucking dice around, which is to be expected.  As a combat system goes, it works.  You basically crash into each other, throw dice, work out your hits and defense, and on you go.  A neat touch is throwing feather tokens around after each wound, but at the same time, the way the rules are laid out means that these feathers aren't going to stick around for long; what they do is rattle your pilots, which in the grand scheme of things means little.  Given that we're chucking dice around, the one or two extra dice your non-rattled pilot gives you won't make too much of a difference.

Perhaps what I'm getting at is that in a game about aerial combat, it just didn't seem to flow correctly.  Crashing into another bird locks them together and displaces them; that feeling of momentum so wonderfully represented by the flight-path system (think X-Wing or Attack Wing) is insta-gone as birds stop and reposition mid-flight to peck at each other.  It seemed weird.  So long as you cross a branch, you can immediately stop and land on it.  Like I said above, it all works from a gameplay perspective and adds to your strategic choices (which is why despite my griping, I've given this game a pretty good score), but from an aesthetic perspective, wouldn't a game about non-hovering birds (these ain't colibri) be more about managing your velocity, altitude, etc?  Maybe I just expect too much.  I also didn't like (at least in the first scenario) that the entire point was to kill your opponent's nest when the game's main attraction is aerial combat.

Despite all of that, I liked the game a lot.  It's wonderfully whimsical, but has a nice dark edge to its story that gives weight to what you're doing on the table.  I never played Mice and Mystics (we're getting to it), but this is a wonderful world that I would like to visit more often.  As a kid, the Secret of NIMH was one of my favorite movies and this game just speaks to that inner child of mine.

This is an excellent mix of bird combat and ground missions. I play with the advanced rules and enjoy it as much as X-Wing (maybe more so that everything you ever need is in the box and there is no power creep from expansions). Only downside is that the birds are fiddly when they get in close due to the large wingspan on the models.

I think this is my favourite miniatures game of all time.  It's natural to compare it to X-wing as it's a flight path game, but there's more to it than that.  The flight path mechanic is simplified, allowing the addition of ground units and additional elements that set this apart from the competition.  And these miniatures are gorgeous!

I'm struck by how complete and self-sufficient the package appears to be, offering 4 pre-built scenarios, a scenario-building system and a campaign system. My son said it felt more complete and deeper than the X-wing starter set initially felt and I think I agree. 

The combat systems are also a bit more complex & unpredictable than I was expecting. 

There are opportunities for bluffing in several places during the turn, including the initiative roll, the "tilt" fake-outs that can happen based on pilot skill (i.e. changing your telegraphed direction at the last minute), & the mission card plays. Speaking of which... the mission card mechanism is brilliant and I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like it. These are selected at the beginning of every round, along with a contingent of committed troops for the mission. These will allow each player to perform a special skirmish action with their committed ground units at the end of the round (from attacking in-flight targets, to spawning your units on the opponent's tree, to reviving a downed bird & pilot, to... you guessed it, a decoy). The cool part: this card becomes an actual attackable, placed, element in the center of the field (?!) allowing an opponent to go after it and reveal the card as well as kill units committed to it. This adds a nice focus to the center of the battlefield and slows the rush to the opponent's base corner.

The cons: there's a lot going on with this game, which can make it a bit difficult to track everything if players decide to play with all of the "optional" or advanced mechanisms (death spirals, special ability cards, feathers, etc), but I think this will get better with more plays and I hesitate to strip them back out since they do add some nice elements to the thematic immersion. The miniatures, though a huge part of the appeal of the game, are somewhat unwieldy and tend to get bumped and tipped a lot during gameplay, so don't expect precision tournament play like X-Wing with this one.

Such a beautiful game, and mechanically clever. I can't imagine wanting to play X-Wing over this.

I suspect this hasn't risen further in the rankings because it's too different from the light family experience Mice and Mystics explores, but appears too "cute" for the tactical crowd. I think either camp would enjoy this if they gave it a chance.

If only I had gamer family members to play this with, what epic battle would occur in the trees! I am not real interested in War Machine (spells and measuring movement distance) or X-Wing (which way someone is facing). I know this game has both of those, but for some reason the theme and multi-tier play of trees, leaves, and ground game makes it highly interesting! Also, i saw an epic middle tree/corner tree layout online for a 4 player variant, and this made me geek squeak!

I could see someday my daughter getting into painting miniatures. She likes looking at them at our FLGS. She is very artistic and I know this would be an activity both of us would enjoy.

Mice and Mystics take flight in tactical aerial combat. Scenarios and missions. Defend or capture an area, or destroy the opponents nest. Miniatures with movement arcs and a range stick--literally. Introduces a "tilt" phase to depict birds banking left or right. Place tree obstacles on the engagement area and deploy mission tokens (or are they decoys?). Multi-use dice, make sure to save cheese wedges to spend on action cards. Mice piloting birds, defend the nest from the trees, Zerg on the ground, or jump on a leaf above and float towards the enemy tree line. Aerial death spirals, flyers get rattled flying through a burst of tail feathers.

Preordered from PlaidHat online store.
It contains an additional scenario for Downwood Tales.
Interesting skirmish game with wonderful miniatures and components.
The rules are not easy to digest (only slightly better than the rulebook for Mice and Mystics) and the variety of available figures is limited.
On the other hand, the components are extremely detailed and appealing and the downtime during a turn is very short.
Altogether, it is an O.K., fun skirmish game that is visually wonderful, but with cranky mechanics and a slightly intricate rulebook.

This is a deeper game than I was expecting after playing through Mice & Mystics.  The mission system is very cool and mixes very well with the aerial combat.  I was surprised at the depth of this game and believe I'd rather bring this to the table than X-wing.  

X-wing may have more choices to build lists, but that actually serves as a detriment to my playing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The components are beautiful, and the theme really shines in the game. Unfortunately, this is a textbook example of a game that is not streamlined _at all_. Never during the design process, the designer took a step back and asked himself if the rules guarantee a smooth play, or if a rule could be replaced by a simpler and more consistent one. This results in an overly complex ruleset. I see potential in the game, but I suspect that it will only survive the test of time if there will be a 2nd edition that is far more streamlined.

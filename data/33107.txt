Juego de negociación, y gestión/control del territorio, ganando puntos de victoria de diversos modos, pero casi todos a raiz de conseguir buenas negociaciones. En una partida a 4 vemos una mecanica extra de subasta de cartas de los otros 2 colores que no acaba de cuadrar del todo, y concluimos que este juego es mejor jugarlo con 5 o 6 jugadores. Componentes muy chulos y juego barato para lo que lleva, puntazo el reloj de arena de 4 min. Falta probarlo más para valorarlo mejor

Lot of downtime and very few interesting decisions. And I'm giving Senji a "five" eventhough I managed to pull a win in the game.

A big minus for the designers is mixing up the names in kanji and in romaji. In kanji it says Jisen (time war) instead of Senji (war time).

So much better than game of thrones!

The emperor post, the way actions are determined even before your first turn is very refreshing. 

The battle mechanics are excellent, strategic use of units and samurai and not overly dependent on dice. The use of cards to get dice support is also a great mechanic. 

The different ways to get points are also refreshing. Giving rise to multiple ways to win. 

Beautiful components and map art.

RATING: N/A
Dice used to determine movement into enemy territory and combat resolution. A military support card is used to modify combat point pool. Points came be awarded after combat. 

3 types of Diplomacy cards (which can also be converted to points): Family member (hostage), military support, (can't remember the third type). Note: 4 minute timer on diplomacy.

Hanifuda card combinations (set collection) awards very big points.

Game ends after a player hits 60+ points after end of the autumn phase.

Thoughts: Too many action choices? Reviewers say best with 6 players.

Senji takes a multi-player conflict game in the style of Dune or A Game of Thrones and adds to it a set collection sub-system in the style of Rummy.  That sounds bizarre, but it kind of works.  

Diplomacy cards are a novel element.  They come in three types: family member, trade and allies.  Generally speaking, you want other people's diplomacy cards, but don't want to give them yours.  Attack an opponent holding your family member and they will be executed for a loss of v.p.'s; a trade card given back to you results in the loss of a hanafuda card.  Negotiations can and do extend beyond simple exchanges of trade cards. 

Strategically, your choices boil down to hanafuda set collecting, winning battles, or a combination of the two.  Whichever route you take, there will be a high degree of luck - in drawing the right cards or in the Dice of Destiny rolling your way. 

In terms of the number of actions you will get, the game is short; the two that I've played lasted three and five turns.  There is no time to recover from a significant defeat.  Like houjix, I find the game almost too short to be satisfying.  

What can compound that dissatisfaction is that the game can end very abruptly.  60 points is the target to end the game and I've seen players score more than forty in a single turn. If players do recognise that they are playing the final turn, it leads to end of the world tactics like attacking as many provinces as possible (the dice may be kind!) or doing nothing but draw hanafuda.

My two plays of this game have been fun.  However, the high level of randomness and that sense of something larger and more interesting being crammed into a package that must play in 90 minutes ultimately leave me dissatisfied.

The rules are well written, though there are clearly some gaps, particularly around sea movement.  Production quality and artwork are both very good.  A minor gripe is that some use of colour on the dice would have helped.  I would also have wished for the hanafuda to have looked more like the beautiful Japanese cards they are named after.

On the basis of a single game, where everyone was learning as I read the rules to them, I like this. The specifics of when it's a good idea to trade cards, and which to be trading eluded all of us initially but I think we started to realise better toward the end. Non-aggressive play also led to a hoarding of cards as players went for an economic victory instead of combat.

RATING: 6
Szerintem ez egy alulértékelt játék! A komolyságához képest meglepően gyorsan lepereg, egymás után lezavartunk 3 partit. Shogunra emlékeztet annyiban, hogy Japán tartományaink vannak, amelyeken akciókat hajthatunk végre (különbség, hogy itt sokkal egyszerűbbnek tűnik a döntés: 3 féle akció közül választhatunk). Itt is lehetőség van egységek feltelepítésére, és mozgásra-harcra, de megjelenik egy lényegesen új elem is: kártyákat is szerezhetünk a tartományokról (különféle állatokat pl.), és a legkülönfélébb kombókat próbálhatjuk meg összegyűjteni. Emellett vannak diplomáciakártyáink, melyekkel (4 perces időlimiten belül) kedvünkre csencselhetünk, 6-nál kevesebb játékos esetén egy ötletes titkos licittel szerezhetjük meg a nem játszók kártyáit. A diplomáciakártyák némelyike csatában segíthet, mások kártyák lopására alkalmasak, illetve néhány kártya a többiek családtagjait jelképezi, akiket túszul lehet ejteni, illetve háború esetén kivégezni. Rendkívül változatos a játék, tisztán kártyagyűjtögető stratégiával is van esély a győzelemre, de a folyamatos seregfelhelyezés és támadás is sok pontot szerezhet. Nagyon nehéz olyan helyzetbe kerülni, ahonnan nincs remény a fordításra. Nagy ötlet a császárt vendégül látó játékos szerepe, de sajnos az előnyt szerző játékos ezzel további előnyhöz jut. De emiatt egyértelmű, hogy kit kell ütni a játékban:) A játék nem fix körös, de így se nyúlik el, mert mínusz pontot jóval kevesebb módon szerezhetünk, mint pluszt, és fix 60 pontot kell elérni. A játékból ki lehet esni, de nagyon nehezen. Még ha tartomány nélkül maradunk, akkor is visszatérhetünk a tengerről, némi pontveszteség árán (ha van pontunk).
Összességében komoly, mély és szórakoztató játék, szívesen játszom vele, és meglep, hogy mennyire nem ismert, és nem közkedvelt játék. A szerzőtől a Mr. Jacket is szeretem, de azért ez más kategória. Ezek szerint ilyet is tud:)
---
Kipróbáltuk végre 6-an is. Rontok a pontszámon, mert nem érzem kiegyensúlyozottnak a területi leosztást. A két széle sokkal könnyebbnek tűnik, ezen a tengeri rajtaütés lehetősége sem segít. Emellett túl erősnek érzem a kártyagyűjtögető stratégiát, főleg az erre specializált szamurájokkal.

A feudal Japanese game of politics and conquest. The game is fairly simple and is similar in many ways to [GameID=20551] (with dice replacing the cube tower). It's a fun game, though it could possible favor attacking more than it does. The additional power given to the leader may cause a runaway leader problem if not fixed by the other players.

Had a lot of fun on my first play. One player hoarded hanafuda cards all game and powered into the lead in a massive cash-in at the end.

When the rules were being explained, I expected to like this more than I did.

Since people can privately trade you family cards around. No one really knows when back stabbing is going on. That caused it family members to get passed a lot and took the thunder out of back stabbing.

If you get attacked, it can really cripple you.

I think there needs to be a hand limit. The way it is right now people just loaded up on cards until they hard enough points to win.

It was hard to beat down on people on the edge of the map.

I loved the combat system.

The family members is a cool mechanic.

I only played this game once.  Components were nice.  The game played well past the trade phase.  The trade phase was just dumb.  There seemed to be little strategy to trading.  You had to do it to get anywhere in the game, but the when and who and how of trading felt almost arbitrary.  If you were playing this competitively, I think it would break down almost entirely as people would simply refuse to trade with the leader.

More like any other game I've ever played, this felt like a jumbled mess of mechanics, like the author thought: "Oh, I like the backstabbing in Diplomacy, but I also like hand-management and set collection, and for the heck of it, let's put in some forced negotiation mechanic with a time limit (think Cosmic Encounter) into it as well". It just doesn't blend well and is way overloaded on mechanics for so much randomness at its core.

The game is going to sit at a solid 7 rating for the time being. Its a little lower due to the fact that despite being playable with 3 or 4 players, it is really best with 5 or 6.

The score is likely to go up once I get a few more plays under my belt and really understand the workings. Not to mention I'd like to play it with a full compliment of players.

Decent area control game with direct player interaction. Trading cards and set collection is the main mechanic which was fun enough, but otherwise fairly plain all around.

RATING: 5
Beautifully produced with great art and components as one has come to expect from Asmodee. (except that the dice should have been colour coded - not just with black&white symbols)

Unfortunately, it is simply not my 'type' of game: backstabbing and negotiating with an aspect of card/set collecting. 

One strong criticism: the map is inherently unfair for some starting players. In a 4 player game, all 3 of red's territories are border territories while black and purple only had 1 border territories to defend and could pile all 3 of their starting units in one territory. This puts red in a significant disadvantage to start.

I could appreciate it from a design level and I valued some of its original mechanics and how it was put together. There will be those who will really enjoy this game, but alas, it wasn't for me.

A long game, but very little downtime due to the numerous decisions that must be made.   It's actually quite a brain burner if you're playing carefully because you need to make the most of your cards and also ensure that you have enough provinces.

A slightly curious mixture of risk-ish combat mechanics with euro-ish card-set collection (much prettier, more varied and potentially more powerful than the risk card mechanic but also, arguably, more random) and all very nicely presented.  

Overall a bit long and on the random side for my tastes these days - back when we were playing Shogun (Samurai Swords) regularly this would likely have gone down much better.  And just because the rulebook warns you about it doesn't mean there isn't a runaway leader problem!

RATING: 7
Let's start this rating with an "8." This is really the only true diplomacy game I own... it's negotiation with some nastiness, and I find that blend pretty darn intriguing. 

After one play, it's a bit tough to comment with authority, but here it goes anyway. I like the diplomacy cards; your own cards are worthless to you, but they are I.O.U's to other players, and have value accordingly. The timer for a 4-minute negotiation session adds some urgency, and the player hosting the emperor gets to "call the shots." With negotiation, order selection, and an economic set collection component, there's a mix of phases, but they all seem to blend together nicely.

In our first game, scoring starts out meekly, but very quickly there's major point gains, with the whole thing wrapping up in about five or six rounds. It's 60 points for the win, with a combat or economic trade potentially netting 20+ points. I'll be curious to see how much winning depends on luck or instead some tactical timing.

This is nice to have around because it's a heavier game that's ideal with six players. It was very good with 5 players, but I wouldn't try 4 or less.

And ultimately, you can assassinate someone's grandmother to dishonor them for attacking you, and that's pretty cool.

Update: a 2nd play, and I still like this game. A few concerns--someone beat on early can really get marginalized for the long haul. This is undoubtedly a game of negotiation and diplomacy, so there's plenty of "take that" to spread around. But as long as you have six people up for that sort of experience, this strikes me as a solid option.

Update: I eventually traded this one away after watching it sit on the shelf for 2+ years. The problem is that it's best with six players, but I have a hard time finding six to play this one that I expect would actually enjoy it. I suspect it is too random for the folks in my gaming circles that gravitate to more serious titles. I'll still have a soft spot in my heart for this title though, if only for the ultimate sand timer that comes with it!

I like different ways to score especially the delightfully Mahjong-esque cardsets which reinforce theme in a different way. I like the orders and limited "Risk" aspect. The trading seems necessary to make the elements work, but became less interesting to me over time. I think ultimately the burden of mechanics bog it down. Pros and cons, and a lot that works, but first play was too long. Maybe play to 30 points?

Diplomatic aspect forcing multi-negociation is quite difficult to achieve but very interesting.

You need to have and own cards from other player to increase your political grasp of the map, which is essentially realistic in the sense of gaining the Shogun title.

A little bit of luck to obtain the right series but if you use your market well, you can sneak peak other players cards to get pieces of what you are looking for.

Not a trivial game but seems to have quite some depth.

The game feels a bit more chaotic and random than I would have liked. Also, the diplomatic phase should have been more important and not just swapping some cards around.

I simply love Senji. One of Asmodee's best in my opinion. Each player has his own color. Each color has different number of traders, people, miltary cards.

Trader cards lets you pick a card from your oppenent's hand. For example if you got a four red trader card in your hand, the red player chooses four resource cards from his hand and gives them to you. Out of the four cards you pick one and give the rest back. A two red trader card is he gives you two cards and you pick one and give the other back.

People cards can be used two ways in Senji. Put in front of you for victory points as long as they are in front of you. If you keep them in your hand, for example a three blue citizen and the blue player attacks you, you can kill off the citizen to make the blue player lose six points. It's twice the value of the card.

And military cards lets you add dices to your total when in battle. Either when attacking or defending.

You can't use your own colored cards during your turn to do stuff. There is a moment during the game round which you can trade your cards to the other players. You play your oppenent colored cards during your turn to do stuff. It's an interesting twist to the game. If you want to do things during your turn, you need to trade cards.

You can do one action per territory that you have. You have three choices in all. Move an army (to attack in most cases), add two armies or draw two resource cards.

Worth taking a look.

As a wargame it requires a lot of preparation and thought for each battle but then ends up completely random. As a trading game it is nothing but a kind of glorified rummy where luck of the draw will always win over any kind of planning. As a diplomacy game it sucks, because the usual problems of ganging up on somebody arise. You might be able to play this game with a group that has a very specific mindset, but I found it to be a horrible, even painful experience (and I even won, because my rummy hand was the best)

Another of those big, multi mechanic games I usually don't care for. This one is a little different with the addition of the diplomacy phase though. A couple phases seem convoluted to me though. 

My first play of this will go down as the game where I screwed up and accidentally cheated, denying myself (or possibly one other person) an honest win. Lame.

Senji looks like a game that has a lot of potential. I give it props for at least making an attempt to inject a Samurai theme, unlike the bland Shogun (Wallenstein). 

Strategically speaking, players have multiple ways to get VPs (and that's a good thing). Unlike A Game of Thrones, Senji gives players other options to get VPs other than fighting, so it's not a wargame like AGOT is. 

But ultimately, Senji is let down by some very weird things. For one, there's no real negotiation (regardless of what it says on the BGG game mechanics category), as players are just trading cards with other players which may or may not impact on who they attack that round. 

And most of the time, you won't attack. Because combat is extremely attritional, the consequences are just as bad for the victor as the loser. The most important thing is that the victor can get a lot of VPs for winning. So you need to attack but you need to pick your moment. It can make for glacial gameplay as everyone just bides their time.

The lack of combat also takes away a lot of the tension from the secret orders deployment. Most of the times, it just doesn't really matter.

But the real weirdness is in the victory conditions of this game. You need 60+ points to have a chance of winning but in one turn, a player could, through a combination of battle, hostage cards, hanafuda cards, get 40+ points. It just sets up incredibly weird endgame situations.

RATING: 5
I'm not a fan of diplomacy games, war games, or area control games, so this falls flat for me. Sure, you can play peacefully as long as everyone else does, but that just ups the set collection/trading aspect (reminiscent of Settlers of Catan).

Having the Emperor choose the order of activations is a pretty cool concept, though.

My son and his friend ( 13 and 14 years old ) have loved this game after the first play.
The different mechanics of the game are all very interesting and you have to play slightly different with the different families, because they didn´t have all the same strenght´s and weaknesses.
This could be the heir to Diplomacy or the Game of Thrones.

RATING: 7.5
Senji is a strange sort of mix of games.  It has some Risk related dice-based war gaming conquest, some resource card gathering and trading, and some free-wheeling player negotiations.  Surprisingly, all of these mechanics blend together surprisingly well, and if you can get a full game of six, you'll have an incredibly fun time, especially when it comes time to the negotiation stages, where everyone is free to openly and privately discuss with one another who to back-stab and what deals and trades will be made.  It can be rather intimidating with all the rules and different stages involved in each complete turn, and the game tends to encourage betrayal, coercion, and false flattery for the winning player, which may be off-putting to some, but it has a unique and diverse gameplay all its own, and is an excellent game with the right crowd.

Imagine that two people build up 5 armies each.  Then one person attacks the other.  A single dice roll then decides 20pts for the attacker - a full 1/3 of the points needed to win the game.  The loser gets nothing but a destroyed army.  Quite a wild swing for a roll of the dice.  The game isn't that bad, but you have to be okay with this kind of dice luck in a game.  I don't mind dice as they tend to average out.  There's just not enough rolls and there is so much riding on them it just annoys people.  My other problem with the game was the diplomacy phase felt rather neutered.  It was mostly a matter of exchanging cards with as many people as possible since it benefits both players.  The relatives was a very cool thing but not enough to make up for the boring nature of the rest of the game.

An interesting experience. Senji is the first game that I play without enjoying that I don't immediately see how to change into something better.

Every aspect of the game fits and can't really be removed but no aspect fully works for me. There's a lot of unengaging downtime, lots of chaos and lots of player stalemate by elimination (if you're in a six player game and got only a single action against one or two players with six then you're going to lose and there's nothing you can do about that).

I could be convinced to try it again some day but not likely.

Nice map & two way strategy of achieving victory by collecting Hanafuda card sets, or via honor points through military actions. The hostage taking feature is quite interesting, and the battle system is easy to learn (combo of using cards & dice). Some betrayals can occur by executing other player's family members, and there can be much diplomacy. The use of dice for battle and support can be incredibly swingy- annoyingly so, which sometimes yields results that amount to utter nonsense. Ultimately, Senji is outdone by Shogun, which is a better game that strikes the same feeling from the same period, by A Game of Thrones- which does a far better job at handling the Diplomacy & uses the same type of area programming (as Senji), and finally, by Ikusa (Samurai Swords) which far exceeds any Japan themed game when it comes to pure dice rolling conquest.

RATING: 2.5
Although I like Weuros, this one left me lukewarm. The chaotic 4min Diplomatic phase where players try to trade their cards is just too cumbersome. It has nothing at all to do with diplomacy, only some "I give you mine and you give me yours". You don't like to give your ships or your relatives to other players, so you spend them only on the neutral auctions. And also when you get cards by "producing" it's very luck dependent if you get poor cards or highly valuable cards like "animals" or "suns" for which you get many victory points when you have collected sets. All in all the luck factor is much to high.
So like Shadows over Camelot from the same designers the core of the game is set collection. Not innovative nor entertaining. Furthermore I don't like the way the system is prone to Kingmaking. And it has the opposite of a runaway leader problem. If you fall behind because auf lost battle, then your weakened position will let you fall back further. This is not a good sign of balancing.
Some nice ideas in this game but to much messed up for amibitious players. For the game balancing it should not be best player that hosts the emperor but the weakest. I had two really unsatisfying plays of this with boring downtimes and I don't think I will add a third.

Not totally bad, but it feels like two games in one and they do not mesh well. There is a very much luck dependent war game and a completely random set collection game. You may win by doing nothing other than drawing cards. A player who is attacked and loses a province in the first turn will have a hard time to recover. The free-form negotiation phase (and blind bidding with fewer than six players) that starts every game turn is not my cup of tea, but it is mercifully short, due to the included sand timer. However, the end-of-round phase, when players, one at a time, take cards from the others and decide which sets to play, takes too long and really slows down the game. On the production side, nice miniatures, but the dice really should have colors.

Interesting Game of Thrones variant. The hostage mechanic is a nice feature. But we must've played the game the wrong way, because everybody mostly ended up just collecting sets. Very few attacks and nobody getting new samurai. I'm not sure if the war part and the card collection part really gel. Only played once, though, so my opinion will probably change.

Senji should get a lot more good press than it does.  The theme is great, components are amazing, the rules are straightforward, and it's a fantastic 3-6 player game.

Combines area-control, diplomacy (read: treachery), and hand-management.

The trick-taking element of the game can be a little stale, and it's hard to track-down the leader once a player pulls well ahead.  But all told, a very cool feudal-japan era game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very fun game. I just love the diplomacy and secret order programming (simulaneous action selection). More specifically, here are features of the game that I love: 

1. Each player starts with three province. Each province gets one action (build forces, produce resources, or move/invade) which players choose and program secretely in advance during a certain game phase. Then whoever has the most victory points chooses the order in which provinces perform their assigned actions. This makes for big highs/big lows because depending on the order decided by the leader, invasions, for instance, can occur either before or after a defending province gets a chance to build defenses. 

2. There is a diplomacy phase that is regulated by card trading. Players have a variety of cards which they can trade, including "family member" cards which they can give to other players to hold as volunteer 'hostages'. If you attack a player who has your family member, your opponent can execute the said member. Executing a family member wins the executioner big points and but makes the other player lose points. But the brutal and wicked thing is that if you manage to scrounge someone else's family member, you can secretely sell him or her to another player. This means that if your family members are circulating among other players, there is a risk that you might attack someone who will execute a loved one. "Oh what's that? You want some of this? Well then say goodbye to granpapa!"  

3. I really liked the balance in the game. If you lose a battle you are not permanently set back. If you lose your forces, you can get them back fairly quickly. If you fall behind in resources (hanafuda cards), you can make them back. If you are facing a tough opponent, you can wrangle some cards that will give you solid advantage. Of course, the winner is the one who can do all this with least losses. 

4. The combat is extremely fast and easy. 

IN SUM: Because of the secret order programming, the diplomacy, and the fact that turn order is decided in gameplay, I was on the edge of my seat all game. Many times I had a shot of adrenaline either because I was scheming some evil or watching other people's plots unfold. There was zero downtime, raucus tear-in-the-eye laughs, much drama. 

STRATEGY NOTE: Everyone needs to shift momentum away from the player who is in the lead. If you attack weaker players, you may get easy kills but the leader will run away with the game. Try mobilizing a trade and diplomacy embargo against the leading player. If the leader is unchallenged, the game may come to a slightly abrupt end.

RATING: 4.5
Have been wanting to play this one for some time, and was able to play a 6-player game with experienced players (I was the only newbie).

A nice game of Diplomacy, with better mechanics and good looking components.

I especially liked the combat resolution system, which I prefer over a similar (but a tad more complex) game of Wallenstein/Shogun.  But there is no reason (other than prohibitive cost!) to not have colored the combat dice, as we were constantly asking which color those icons represented!

Hidden runaway leader problem, with one player going from last place with 28 points, and scoring a whopping 68 points in a single turn (game ends when a player passes 60 points), outscoring 2nd place by 30+ points...  I guess everyone else simply missed a good game....  (Score: 96, 63, 62, 61, 58, 57)

And for the life of me, why would anyone not wait until the last turn to cash in their Hanafuda cards?

This is actually a set collecting game, set in Medieval Japan with a War/Diplomacy sub-game, similar to IMPERIALISM (where stocks is where the game's at.. in this case it is set collecting cards).

House Rule: Only one set of cards is allowed to be "cashed" in per turn.

RATING: 3
It's not a bad game. Just a kind of game that i don't enjoy.
It's one of these free for all games, where it is more important to use subtle meta-gaming means to look weak & divert attention away from you until you can swoop in & finish the game in one turn. Otherwise the usual leader-bashing will prevent you from winning, no matter how clever your first turns were.

The hanafuda part is my main problem with the game. The autumn phase in wich everyone is going through his hanafuda cards is sooooooooooooo long. Every player is going through all the offered "trade" cards while everyone is waiting, that is by far the biggest & most boring part of the game. So much downtime & for what? Getting VPs due to collection pairs?!

The really cool & unique mechanic in this game is the diplomatic trade phase.. in wich your beloved uncle can somehow end up as a hostage with your enemy. And you have to decide to attack him anyway or call the whole thing of.

This used to be my comment after 2 plays but I played again recently & found the game very long & quite swingy.  I don't feel like playing it again.  "An interesting game that works best with 6 players & is shorter than all the other "conquest" games I play.  There is a fair amount of politics in the game & along with that it's interesting to decide how to balance gaining points from combat with gaining points from cards.  Also, there's some unique stuff here that I haven't seen in other games, particularly the diplomacy cards & the way they make you keep your promises!"

Aug08: So hard to judge.  So much to like and so much odd stuff to come to grips with.

I really like the negotiation card phase.  The cards just make agreements so easy to reach and hold you binding.

I like how the order system is very simple and easy to understand.

I like how the combat is a quick and yet meaningful affair.

I do not like how long the accounting phase lasts and all the passing and randomness that goes into building sets of economic cards.

So, if you're a Waro fan, then give it a try!  It's right up there with Shogun for me.

A beautiful and engaging game. If you're looking for in-depth combat then it isn't for you, but if you're looking for a tense, dramatic game with lots of player interaction then you'll probably enjoy it. It's a conquest game with significant social aspects, so it could possibly make a decent gateway game, though the complexity could detract from that.

This is a very ambitious design.  It is really has Ameritrash sensibilities with some very Euro design elements.  There would appeart to be a couple of paths to victory.  It also tackles at least one of the classical difficulties in multiplayer wargames -- how do you deal with the gang up on the leader, problem.  In this game, they reward the leader, so that even though everyone might attack them, they can still manipulate the turn in their favor.  

It plays reasonably quickly.  The trading system is an interesting mix of structure (using the cards) and free-form diplomacy (you could deal on anything).  

Despite the games innovations, I am not sure the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.  I didn't feel terribly engaged, and there seemed to be more "right answers" than dilemma, particularly in the game's set collecting economic engine.  

I can imagine this game being very popular in some circiles, but I doubt it will be in ours.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really appreciate the general concept and several ideas from here (especially the phase of exchaging cards (e.g. your family memeber as a hostage) between players).
BUT the game is terribly unbalanced.  The gameflow is highly accidental and random.  One or two players can be easily put out of the contention early on.  Final scores vary very much (leaders can have more than twice points than outsiders).  On the other end the fate of victory is decided by sheer luck in drawing Hanafuda cards, because margin between leaders is small.

All in all, great concept and ideas, but the execution is somewhat disappointing.  Pity.  I'd like to see some ideas from here explored and incorporated in future titles.  They deserve it.

Actually a bit better than I thought it would be, especially considering you can describe the game as: [i]Go Fish Set Collection with a light War Element.[/i] 

I thought it was good overall, and liked the 4 minute out of room diplomacy phase best taking a page from Diplomacy, Game of Thrones, and Virgin Queen etc (like those ones more for sure, note this is shorter). Note though this is FAR less devious than any of those games mentioned, and much less of a game for the most part too.

Some very good things in here (albeit some borrowed from other games), and a lot going on within a fairly simple rule set.

The trading and board play is great. It can bog down a little in the autumn phase when some players get well into analysis paralysis on what they want to do with their resources.

It's often hard to tell when the game will end, as the cautious apprach (build up hanafuda cards over several turns hoping to drop some killer combos) can be undone by an audacious attack with a lot of troops involved, in which someone's going to score a lot of points...

I hate giving Senji the same sort of rating that I'd give utterly unplayable roll-and-move Hasbro dreck, but "extremely annoying game, won't ever play again" aptly describes my feelings about Senji, a game I had at one point looked forward to owing and, even after giving that up, looked forward to playing. To be clear, I'm not adverse to war-ish Euros or to luck elements, but so little of Senji as a game actually made sense to me. Perhaps it's to satisfy "honor," but the game forces pitched battles, rewards high casualty rates, and favors the attacker at an unacceptably high 2:1 ratio over a defensive win. Want to take over a vacant province instead of engaging in a meat grinder? Go ahead, and it'll net you another action, but no VP (which are based on casualties). The bucket-of-dice approach is clumsy, and you'll curse Fate when none of your faction symbols come up on about a dozen dice. Giving the Emperor power to the VP leader makes thematic sense, but it amplifies the leadership advantage. The actual diplomacy phase is (mercifully) timed, but what really seemed to eat up the hours was the other stuff--having the Emperor player decide who performed each and every action when, actually performing the actions, and, especially, trading cards and turning in sets. The game seems like a parody of Euro game design in the way it pulls everyone back toward the middle via giant bounds in the score and how the pitched battles so necessary to scoring leave even the victory militarily exhausted.

The game is nice looking and has good component quality. I like the theme. I also like the diplomacy in general, though in opting for maximal negotiability in the form of the Emperor player's power to decide in what order every single action is performed in, it bogs the game down. By the end of our first and only six-player game (meaning we were playing at the theoretically optimal number of players for this game), we were laughing about how random and pointless everything seemed. We finally called the game when the third or fourth round ended without an outright winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unlike the general consensus, I am not impressed by the theme, but I am drawn to the relatively quick playtime and the negotiation aspect of the game.  In my first play I think I was a little disappointed, mainly in the lack of shocking backstabbing, but perhaps that will change in future games.  I found Senji to be quite balanced.  In teaching the game, I cautioned against letting players hoard hanafuda cards, but the winner completely ignored them.  It seems like there is a good balance between the different types of strategy which makes it difficult to both bolster your own potential and smack down the leader.  It seems like the game would suffer with fewer than 6 players, so hopefully we are able to get this back to the table soon, as I would imagine that the game improves with repeat sessions.

RATING: 8
While I was reading the rules, a lot of games kept jumping into my mind: the negotiation phase reminded me to diplomacy, the combat to dune, the secret orders to Game of Thrones... And, really, the game is a sum up of concepts used in a whole bunch of different games. Thankfully they are combined in a way it makes the game have its own, distinctive, playing style.

First of all, I must state that the suggested number of players is a lie: this game is completely unplayable with three and quite a pain with four. While it can be played with five, six is highly preferable. If you have trouble gathering at least five players for a game of its kind, head towards something else immediately or you won't have pleasant ride.

Senji's core mechanism, the one which gives makes it appealing is the deck of diplomacy cards. Each faction has his own set of cards, which range from members of your family to troops or merchants. You give or exchange your own cards to grant the opposing player a one time benefit, which he can claim the moment he sees fit. On the one hand, these bonuses are crucial, as players who don't exchange cards are badly hampered. On the other hand, each time a player exchanges one of his cards, he is strengthening someone else's position. This creates a nice mix of diplomacy and trade, with everything it implies: deduction, bluffing, backstabbing...

In its core, Senji is a light wargame mixed with a set collection euro, but thanks to the diplomacy cards and the secret orders, it all merges together in a very fun and engaging negotiation game.

A simple game on the conquest of Japan.  I don't have a wargame in this area.  This one looks to fill the gap.  But then, it is not a serios wargame, isn't it?

RATING: 5
I didn't really enjoy our Senji play because the leading player had too much power during the events resolution. I was last the whole game, and it felt like I couldn't do anything to come back in the game. 
Basically, during the resolution phase, only one player is playing, and the other are just spectators.

RATING: 7
I had high hopes for this game.  I still like the idea of it, but find the game is too balanced in favor of the cards.  So far, every game we've played has resulted in a win for the player with the most honafuda cards who turns them in on the last turn for a ton of points.  I've toyed with the idea of a hand limit to combat this which I believe would swing the balance back toward a more balanced strategy overall.

When played with gamers you know well and there is a lot of banter and getting into the negotiations, this is a blast. I have played once and loved it. I would never buy this (unless super cheap) because I would always find it difficult to play with our casual gamer friends, and a hardcore gamer friend has his own copy already.

One of my favorite direct conflict/military games. The generals add unique strategies for each player and there is tense fighting for hosting the emperor. I love the hostage system where betraying someone costs more victory points the tighter the bond was. This game deserves much more credit than it has received. I prefer it to Shogun as it fills the same niche with a lot more tension.

Played it with three people - it's ok, but it's going to presumably kick ass with six!

A second play with four people showed the game's potential, as well as some of it's flaws. I still think it's going to be best with six people, but "Best" may not actually mean "Very Good".

EDIT 18.11.2012: after two more plays, my opinion of the game is much better than initially. Pretty cool and I'm looking forward to see it hit the table more often.

EDIT 17.08.2017: in the end, the game didn't end up on the table too often, and it became part of my move-purge.

The rules are so poorly written it makes trying to play from reading them nigh on impossible.  One of the members of my weekly group got tired of waiting for me to figure it out and took it home so he could learn it and instruct the rest of us.
It's a decent game, but does not compare with Shogun, which is the one I would prefer to play.

Rated 6 after one play (rating may change).

In my 6 player game, 5 players were new to Senji. We played without much fighting (about 7 attacks in the whole game). This reduced Senji a bit to a card collection game. That seemed to be more rewarding than attacking.

In the diplomacy phase we focussed mainly on trading cards. this only emphasized the card collection thing. We didn't do much diplomacy like in a game of Diplomacy. I felt that time was too short for that anyway.

Wow, got impressed with the game since it's rates were somewhat low on BGG. Had a really good experience on first play. The game is mechanically quite wide, but still manages to condense enough to fill in a 2h or less session with 6 initial players.

Whenever I'm in the mood for a quick economic/military area control game with strong interaction among players supported by the rules, I'll probably pick this up.

Don't let the emperor BE the emperor too long....or he will win.  Don't let the emperor BE the emperor too long...or he will win.  

When you read this in a ruleset, you know that there is something wrong.  As a matter of fact, being em peror more than half of the time is a sure way to victory....by a LARGE margin.

Beside that point, (don't forget, emperor MUST change hands EACH turn!!!) Senji is a pure negociating game with backstabbing and deceiving.  The Japanese map used (long and narrow) can make a players who is on one of the extremity a bit less vulnerable though...so check it out.

One solo play to understand the rules and be able to teach it. It's fairly complicated and I assume it will suffer from 1 or 2 factions getting behind early. It doesn't seem like it will work well with fewer than the max of 6. 

Also, I can't see a six-player game lasting 90 minutes; more like 2-2.5 hours.

Great looking game and components. The rules are daunting as there are a lot of things to think about but once you get into the flow it works and moves along.

Not fond of the diplomacy negotiation bit. Its all a bit of guesswork. More difficult if you start in one of the middle areas as opposed to north or south where it is easier to maintain interior lines.

Not a lot of movement for a strategic game.

Too harsh on those who get picked on early and tough to recover.

The reward for my Thoughthammer/Olympics winning haiku.

First play was fantastic fun. The game is lighter than I expected, and there's so much going on that things seem chaotic. It feels like a mix of Game of Thrones, Diplomacy, and Ticket to Ride (with the set collection and point scoring.) The negotiations never felt too rushed, and definitely had some tension to them, but I noticed that in later rounds, players who had traded away all their Diplomacy Cards basically were cut out of negotiations. Maybe not a big deal (and their own dang fault, right?) but it might be something to warn new players about.

I will say that all players MUST gang bang the leader or he really and truly uses his advantage to win.

RATING: 7
Pretty cool multi-player conflict game.  Hidden orders like Game of Thrones, plus a timed trade phase that can get pretty chaotic (which I like).  Lots of neat touches, such as the ability to "display" members of the other players' families for victory points, but with the option to kill them to give yourself a combat bonus if you fight against that family; or samurai that die, but stick around a ghost to give you superpowers if killed ("Strike me down and I'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine....")

RATING: N/A
In medieval Japan, each player starts with a Samurai and three armies. Each player has a deck of cards ranging from value 0 to 5. Each card also has a symbol on it to show the function of the card: hostage, trader or warrior. The gameboard shows medieval Japan, and there is a Samurai deck of cards, and a Hanfuda deck of cards. Each player starts with three areas on the board. 

In the diplomatic phase of the game, there is a 4 minute sand timer, and players trade cards out of their hand - they can exchange cards, promise for support later, etc. In the "orders" phase, for each temple they control, players put down orders to either move armies, draw two Hanfuda cards, or increase by two armies. In the action phase, with the order governed by whoever is Emperor, temples resolve their actions. It is possible someone will not be able to resolve an order, if they get attacked and lose their temple. 

Combat is determined by counting up armies, supporting samurai, and the roll of up to 9 dice to roll symbols equal to your faction. Warrior cards traded for in the diplomatic phase can be used here to get some of the other dice to count towards your total. The winner loses the same amount of units as the loser, and if the winner is the attacker they earn VPs equal to double the number of casulties, while if the defender wins, they get nothing. So the game rewards attacking and aggressiveness. 

Hanafuda cards can be cashed for VPs (e.g., 4 different values are worth 4 pts, 4 animals are 8 pts, 4 suns are 12 pts, 12 different values are 24 pts, etc). Whoever is the current leader in VPs is also the Emperor. Hanfuda cards can also be used to draw samurai cards, which give VPs and special abilities. Game ends when someone crosses the 60 VP mark. 

I played once with 6 players. It is an interesting game, with different approaches to try. I tried a strategy of collecting all cards, and it didn't quite work out. I wonder if the starting positions (the edge people seem to have a slight advantage) influences the game as well.

After the first play I have to say: great game!
Many options to gather honor/victory points: 
battles, hire samurais, collect hanafuda cards and create sets, take hostages, ...

I have to play it a few more times to give a final verdict but so far. great!

Nice political game with clever mechanics that produce a fun game, when the players don't take it too seriously.

It's a game for 6 players preferably, the strategy level is very low and while there's some tactical considerations, people will erase you from the map of Japan in a blink whenever they want, it's very easy to gang upon someone. 

So, ideally, it should be played fast with a light and fun mood, and I would even recommend an aggresive approach.

While its duration is short for a political game, it's still too long for such a light game.

RATING: 7
Played once at Gen Con, was prepared to buy immediately but Asmodee wanted cash only. In hindsight I'm glad because a lot of the appeal wore off once I thought about it. It's a very fun game but it's nothing that hasn't been done before. It is similar to a lighter version of Game of Thrones, though the 'honor' victory point track means that strategies are going to be much less aggressive and turtling is at many points encouraged. Hopefully I can get a couple more plays in before I make a purchasing decision. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting Euro/ wargame hybrid.  Generally I liked the system but I'm a bit unsure on the power of holding the emperor.  It seems to me that because of the way battles are fought (with both winner and loser losing troops) it almost doesn't matter whether you win a battle as long as you hold the emperor's favour and get to go first next turn.  Not sure if I really like this.

[b]Senji[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I've only played one 4p game of Senji and we were all new to the game, so bear that in mind when you read my impressions of Senji. Senji is Diplomacy with a timer for negotiations with some added set collection thrown into an area control/dudes on the map game. Senji is nasty, be forewarned this game isn't for the feint of heart. 

There are a few things that stand out after my play. First of all the set collection mechanism is just plain weird. I thought it detracted from the gamand made no thematic sense [i](this coming from the person that one because of it)[/i]. Collecting sets of cards was much more of a sure bet as opposed to taking part in a bunch of combat scenarios because of the amount of luck involved in combat. I won a battle that I had no business winning because of the fate dice were with me and not my opponent, who also happened to have a bunch of units he was attacking with too. I completely destroyed his forces and that jump started my game and I cruised to victory.

I definitely think repeated play would uncover a decent game*, but I really don't understand why the set collection element is in the game. It'd be more satisfying to me if the game rewarded a more combat focused strategy, but the randomness of combat makes that a very risky proposition. Also; while reading about Senji after my play the consensus seems to be that 6p is best and 5p is the only other recommended number to play with. I'd tend to agree with this, there weren't enough people to negotiate with and the game suffered because of that.

[COLOR=#009900][i]*There was one moment when I saw the spark of greatness in this game. While negotiating you can trade one of your nobles with someone. This is a sort of insurance against attack because if you later attack that person they can assassinate your noble and you lose double the point value of the card and they gain the point value of the card. However; once you trade a card you don't know where it will end up. My son got another player's noble and then later traded it to me. On the next turn that person attacked me and their face dropped when I then I assassinated their noble. It was absolutely priceless![/i][/COLOR][/i]

Based on one play: Great negotiation where you get up and talk, but you only have 3 minutes. Your cards are worthless to you, so you must get them from other people to help you, but then they can trade your cards to your enemies. Very tight and attacking is rewarded. You must fight for the lead early on since the Emperor has its benefits. Very original and interest, would love to play again. Steap learnign curve though and not for non-gamers.

Un esempio di gioco ibrido: meccaniche tedesche con alea e ambientazione americana. Gli autori hanno ben miscelato un'ambientazione basata sull'Onore e sulle complesse dinamiche che intercorrevano tra le famiglie del Giappone feudale con uno snello sistema di regole che premia tali comportamenti da parte dei giocatori. Occhio: prima di giocare a Senji bisogna liberarsi delle ultime tossine risikiane che, seppur assorbite ormai da svariati lustri, potrebbero facilmente ripresentarsi. Qui si combatte una guerra dove in palio c'è prima l'onore e poi il controllo di un territorio: affronta una battaglia impari e raccoglierai pochi frutti. Conquista territori sguarniti e non guadagnerai punti vittoria, anzi: sfilaccerai il tuo territorio e sarai più indifeso. Interessante anche lo scambio di membri della famiglia e di carte commercio: una volta usciti dal tuo mazzo non saprai mai che fine faranno i tuoi parenti, magari in custodia di quello che hai appena attaccato (che ti renderà subito il favore massacrandoli subito). I presupposti per un bel gioco ci sono tutti, ma alla fine la partita è meno divertente di quanto si pensi. Comunque sufficiente.

I really liked this one. The rest of the gaming group seemed be disappointed with the lack of focus on battles. Personally that was one of the big plusses for me. I enjoy battles being more of a tool serving trade and diplomacy. That and the different systems of cards and dice really made the game mesh for me. Strange, as these same things seems to be the big turn offs for others.

There are a lot of cool things going on in Senji.  I love custom dice, I enjoy the negotiation zaniness, and the trading relatives and promises of aid, and the area-control war theme.  But the meld-making card game aspect didn't feel like it made a lot of sense in context of the rest.  It felt like someone said "let's take Shogun, add Diplomacy-light negotiation, and then to make it really super-cool, let's mix in Go Fish".  What?

I would totally play it again, there is a lot to really enjoy, and good players make it a great game.  But I think it will always be a symphony where the woodwinds are a measure behind the rest of the orchestra.

(1 play)  It took years to get this to the table, but it finally happened - and with the full complement of 6 players!  It was the first play for all 6 players, but the game ran smooth and competent for all players throughout.  The diplomacy phase is the lynch pin that makes the game great, and it did not disappoint.  I found it interesting that a diplomacy game can be played with indirect results.  You offer military or economic support to a player and that support could play out in any number of different ways, and benefit any player - depending on a whole string of future negotiations.  The only thing you can count on is that you just negotiated away a bit of your power/influence - and hopefully what you got ends up to be worth it - when you decide to use it...  This is great.  Senji a game that would thrive with many plays, and unfortunately - that's just not how my gaming generally goes - but I am hanging on to it hoping.

Ugh!!!  What happens when you combine:

- Lackluster negotiations
- Boring and wasteful combat
- Tired old set collection
- Tons and tons of downtime
- Complete and total randomness

...you get "Senji"!!  It's simply a set-collection game (a very bad one) with necessary elements like combat and negotiation tacked on.  The game is borderline broken.

AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!!!

I was surprised at how enjoyable this game turned out to be. It is certainly in the Diplomacy family of games but much lighter and quicker. There are several paths to victory and those that prefer to avoid the diplomacy aspect can play without it (though I don't believe they have a good chance at winning). Some have complained about the dice used in combat - in our games careful planning has always compensated for all but the worst of rolls. 

I have played with as few as 3 players (with the suggested rules for 3 players) and found some of the three player games to be very interesting. There is an increase in tension in these limited games that results in a slightly different feel for the game. I particularly enjoy the 'auction' for the non-playing families.

The games adds life to Diplomacy while significantly reducing the playing time (90 minutes vrs. 6-8 hours).

Several people have complained that the game is not balanced. Obviously they have never played Diplomacy (or a host of other games) where most players consider Italy or Germany (in Diplomacy) to be the kiss of death. If you are looking for perfect balance play Chess, Checkers or Go - if you want an enjoyable challenge, try a game where location, etc. requires different strategies.

One of the advantages to Senji is the quick playing time yet, whenever we play I always wish the game lasted a few more turns. The game has much in common with the feel of Dune but is significantly shorter - the plus is that Dune needs at least 5 players to work well and Senji works with as few as 3.

The trading of favors in the form of cards is awesome.  I love-love-love this mechanic.  I especially love how one can trade away a favor from another player to another player.  This leads to delightfully surprising twists, turns, and betrayals.  I highly recommend gearing your group up for good-natured backstabbery before play.  

However, I can't say that the vast amount of power given to the player in first place really makes this game a better experience.

Interesting use of cards to drive multiple options for diplomacy as well as entertaining combat system which cleanly integrates with diplomacy card swap mechanics. Didn't care much for Emperor selection mechanism as that seems to lead to some runaway leader aspects.

RATING: 6
Some interesting combinations, in a conflict/collection game.

While called a negotiation phase it more about trading. to stand chance during battle or get the cards you need you must trade with your opponents. A good mechanic.
The simultaneous action provides some good decisions. With the leader choosing the order really puts him in the driver seat. Combat is attritional which weakens both sides militarily. 

However military is not the only way to win, you can collect sets of cards for VP or Samurai.
The set collection phase is much weaker and less interesting - but it does provide a significant way to VP's

Must have some leader bashing to force different players to assume the role.

6 players is a must to get the most of the factional nature of the system.
Played with 6 - much better game would not play with less than 5

RATING: 6
It attempts to do a lot of things (negotiation, set collection, trading, combat) but not one of them that well. The worst aspect is how it rewards the leader and players are supposed to betray or gang up on him at one point. The few pros: plays 6 well, plays quick, and looks good.

Nice, relatively light "Diplomacy-like" game. Nice variation because unlike most games of this type, controlling the board, while important, is not your entire goal. Every player starts with a set of "Diplomacy cards" that they can trade to each other for various effects as part of their negotiations.

Played a bit more. Still enjoy this quite a bit and need to play it again soon. It is definitely deeper than it appears to be on the surface.

RATING: 7
Good production quality. The rules are simple, but there is good strategic depth with this one. While no player can allow himself/herself to neglect the military aspect of the game, rarely will someone win solely because of the battles he/she wages. Its merciless combat mechanics and its diplomacy cards are pluses, but players expecting a game focused on war will need to look elsewhere. Works very well with 5 or 6 players (best with 5, though). An elegant, balanced and very well-thought game full of nuances that demands nothing short of full commitiment from its players, requesting from them negotiation skills, military and administrative planning, and a maquiavelical intuition. Best when played till 80 points.

RATING: 7
A lot rides on the trading phase of the game. New players may be confused about why it's important to trade/hold on to certain cards. If there's no diplomacy in Senji, not much can happen. 

I'm skeptical about how losing a battle will still score victory points. It seems there's no good way to stop a runaway leader besides attempting to leave him alone.

Overall: If you have a group of experienced players you'll probably have a good time, however I feel other games have succeeded more using similar mechanics (Game of Thrones, for example)

Senji lets you don the armor of a chief of a Japanese clan in medieval Japan.

Your goal is obvious: to become the daimyo whose honor imposes respect over all the other clans. To achieve your goals and to gain honor, you will have to overcome your adversaries in terrifying bloody battles, by holding in respect the other clans grace, honoring hostages or alliances.

--Sep2008-- Initial experience was, sadly, a bit underwhelming.  There are some lovely cool ideas here, yet the play balance - particularly in the first turn - seems a tiny bit suspect.

My hypothesis (for the moment) is that the player who initially hosts the emperor has a modest advantage.  But more importantly, it appears that if the emperor-host chooses to attack a neighbour in the first turn (a quite sensible action, all considered) and that attack is successful, one might well expect that neighbour to be essentially eliminated.  The difference between two regions in which to play actions and three regions in which to play actions is significant.

In fact, it seemed to me that each turn saw a player take a significant step backward in contention.  Yet there aren't enough turns in the game to spread the pain around.  The winner seems to be, simply, the one whom the others didn't get around to beating on.

So: I'm willing to play again.  But unless I see some different patterns erupt in the next couple games, there's no way I'm buying a copy.  

That said, my 4 rating is as of my one play, and its continuance entirely contingent on things playing as badly as I anticipate.

A multiplayer diplomatic game set in Japanese Feudal background. In this fierce and cruel time, you have to trade whatever you have to achieve victory, including your family members. Some will exchange his wife for another house's grandpa and forge a so-called alliance. Once he considers it worthy, he just breaks the pact and backstabbs anyway, lets his beloved one beheaded and wins the game. What a strange people.

I haven't played too much negotiation games, just: Game of thrones, Pandemic (it has negotiations ;)), Excalibur, and probebly that's all. 

I liked Senji. I want to play it again, but I feel it's quite overwhelming to win. It has so many mechanism working together - trading realized by Hanafuda cards is an element that IMHO is something that makes this game very innovative. Well. What to say more? Play it.

RATING: 6
A war-diplomacy game which can be played in two hours - that at least should grab attention of players who like the genre. There are some more cool unique aspects like negotiations for hostages (who can be later executed), support for future combats, and some not so cool like weirdly out of place set collection mechanism, which is by the way also a strong strategy for generating points. Plays a bit like Game of Thrones, but much quicker, simpler, without support orders and with a dice combat. Not great, but probably the only one in this genre which can be played under severe time constraints.

[i]Diplomacy[/i] light in a [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=347&Itemid=1]A Game of Thrones[/url][/i] style, in which players negotiate and then put order chits secretly, to reveal and execute them later to recruit troops, move, battle and produce. Even when the later comparaison can be made, the game has a lot of original twists and introduces an economic part with the hanafuda cards, which are collected to make sets in order to win points.  These little changes make the difference with the other games mentioned and are very well integrated into the gameplay. The combat system is quick, fair (even when it is clearly luck dependant) and gives players the opportunity of some decisions.  Probably one of my first picks if I want to play a short multiplayer light wargame.

The negotiation aspect of this game makes it absolutely fantastic. There is so much dealmaking, back-stabbing, etc. Hosting the emperor is an interesting position. As another player, you need the Host's help to execute plans correctly, but at the same time you need the Host to drop in points because, well, they're winning. That's why they're the Host. Overall, a great game with lots of interaction and interesting decisions. I am also suprised with how smooth it played. Although it only took 90 minutes, the game feels much bigger.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fun, light wargame combined with an excellent card-trading dealmaking game. Somewhat unconventional which makes it fairly difficult to teach. Some friends have tried a variant where the player with the lowest honor hosts the emperor, and they say it makes for a much more satisfying game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A puzzle.  In some ways, the game suffers (and delights) in the free-wheeling multi-player heavy-conflict genre in which it is firmly placed.  Some of the mechanisms, such as the diplomacy cards used as negotiation tools, are fresh and interesting, and difficult to grasp the ramifications of at first blush.  Other mechanics, such as the order system lifted from Game of Thrones, are functional and provide sufficient interest.  However, the extreme benefits of "hosting the Emperor" (i.e. being in the lead) force the table to gang up against the leader, perhaps moreso than any game I've played in the past two years.  Unfortunately, our first play had a number of serious rule errors and omissions, so the jury is out.  This will be a love/hate sort of game for most; I'm just not sure which end will dominate for me yet.

Very slow and long game, by no means wargame because game is too short. And there is no contradiction here: our game took 3 turns and it was 3 hours. You just can't have any tactics in 3 turns. And it NEEDS to be playes with 6 players, familiar with the rules.

So basically game is set-colection eurogame with some wargame-like twists.

UPD: after second play rating decreased 7->5.
Dull, boring, tedious.
A bunch of interesting mechanics that don't make the game any good.

RATING: 6.899
Since I liked Shogan so much, it's difficult to rate this one better than that one.  However, it's probably a little bit better than the Tilsit game Samourai and Katana.  Should I develop this poker-type hand or attempt to fight off or attack my neighbors?  Weird combination.  There seems to be a lot of luck with obtaining the right cards, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Of course, combat is a bit weird too.  

PROBLEM: My disagreement with the game is the Diplomacy round.  I remember playing a session of Reiner Knizia's negotiation game "Quo Vadis?" that just about caused me the desire to commit Seppuku Hara-kiri.  Thankfully, there is a timer, but still...  Games that encourge the slick-talking used car salesman skill really aren't my thing...

Huh, érdekes egy játék a Senji az biztos, de semmiképp nem az én játékom. A játékosok japán hadurak bőrébe bújva harcolnak a hatalomért Japán térképén. Egymás területéért harcolva és kártyák gyűjtésével lehet pontot szerezni a játékban, tehát lehet kevésbé agresszíven és harcra is játszani, de talán a kettő ötvözete a legmegfelelőbb út. A játék érdekessége az egyik fázis időhöz (4 perc) kötött kereskedés része. Ez 6-nál kevesebb játékos esetén a nem játszó játékosok kártyáinak vaklicitjével párosul. Ha ez az időre való csere nem is hangozna elrettentően, a vaklicit sajnos káosszá teszi a játék ezen részét, ezért talán nagy játékosszámmal jön ki a játék igazi valója. A kártyák különböző kombinációja ad még pontszerzési lehetőséget, ami viszont teljesen véletlenszerű. A játékban így szerintem a kellőnél nagyobb a szerencse szerepe, emellett pedig a játék végét kiváltó 60 pont elérése feltétel sem igazán jött be. Emellett minden játékos egy szamurájjal kezdi a játékát, amelyek ereje nagyban eltér egymástól, ezért az itt húzott lapoknál is befigyel a szerencse. A játék számomra legjobb pontja a kártyák szépsége, de a játéktábla sem csúnya, szépek a kockák, ha még a szamurájok is különbözők lennének akkor még a legfinnyásabbak sem szólhatnának egy szót sem. Maga a játék nem az én stílusom, amúgy sem kedvelem a kereskedős játékokat, ebben pedig ez fontos elem, illetve a szerencse nagy szerepe sem tetszett. A Shogunnal hasonlítják a játékot sokszor, jogosan, míg abban is nagy a szerencse szerepe azért sokkal komolyabb játék, én maradok is amellett.

Ambitious and with a lot of good ideas. BUT. Revealing one action at a time takes too long. Trading and forming the correct sets out of 20 cards takes too long. The only part that doesn't take too long is the one with the timer.

The combat is weirdly swingy and the rewards very variable, perhaps frustratingly so? I didn't care; everything takes so damn long.

Also suspected: balance issues re: the map. Some positions have much more turtle-ability than others.

The jury is still out on this one. It might be a great game, but it seems to have two lousy games included in the box. If everyone plays too peacefully, the game devolves into a rather mundane rummy variant. If everyone plays too aggressively, it turns into a lame Risk derivative, where everyone is limited to twelve armies. The diplomacy mechanic is very interesting, though, and it might be enough to keep the game balanced between its bad extremes, at least among experienced players.

While I appreciate the design of Senji, it fell a little flat for me. Probably cuz I didn't grok all the rules until the very end so a replay is definitely in order. My first impression is that it seems to be a big mashup of a lot of different games from Diplomacy to Wallenstein to Game of Thrones yet lacks its own personality. Hacienda succeeds at becoming its own gaming by intertwining mechanics from a lot of different games to become something new. Beyond the Japanese flavor, I could never discern what I was actually playing.

There are many different routes to victory and even deciding what card combinations to aim for and eventually turn in is a good challenge.  I'm a little wary of negotiation games, but here they are lighter compared to other games, so it works well for me.  I can see more possibilities with the negotiations too.  Besides that, choosing which marker to place on your territories is tough, and battling for enemy territory is a risky proposition.  Looking forward to playing some more.  I can see my rating possibly increasing.

It is not the game I looked for. I removed it from my wishlist and I don't like it. It is working properly, but the element of game of war and conquest is very crippled by stupid hanafuda cards, being, as I assume, a system used to depict resources. It is ok that working on growth of you own province is rewarded, but it is bad if game of war could be won by player who collected best resource cards without showing military prowess. This clash of themes and systems makes me bad.

Senjii appears to be the GOOD copy of AGOT in which mustering, combat, movement and diplomacy have been polished of all the overproduced mechanism invented in AGOT.

Senji ti trasporta indietro nel tempo di svariati secoli, nel Giappone medievale.
L'imperatore sta invecchiando e la sua famiglia si è indebolita. Ogni giocatore è un daimyo desideroso di ottenere il titolo di shogun.
Per riuscire in questo scopo, deve provare la sua abilità nel corso di numerose stagioni, accumulando punti onore, che può ottenere attraverso canali diplomatici, con forza militare o attente strategie economiche.

Played once, three player, which is probably not Senji's best number. The emperor is even more powerful in 3-player than 4-6 player. As in most multiplayer conflict games, a poor player--or even a good player who is behind--can king-make in his final attempt a victory, leaving the other players completely powerless and unable to affect the outcome. In this case, I was the one king-made. While I would have won anyway, it was largely because of the imperial power; the kingmaking only made the win margin so huge as to be ridiculous--and very unsatisfying. Something like 95-65-60.

Lo que más me gusta del juego son las negociaciones y pactos secretos que se pueden realizar y el intercambio de rehenes.

This is an interesting game of trading, fighting, and set collection to score points.  There are no neutral territories to start the game, so if one player conquers another region, another player is hurting right from the get-go.  That can be a little off-putting since the game will run for quite a while.

Great game. It is not a military game, and it is not an area control game. It is a very enjoyable game full of tension up to the last minute. The Emperor is a powerful position that every other player needs to bring him down. The rules are simple, and the components are very good. It plays very well with 4 to 6 people. There is some downtime during the autumn phase but nothing major. There are many different strategies that can be employed and a lot of decisions to be made. I enjoy this game better than game of thrones. It is simpler, easier to explain, and has more excitement. Game of Thrones is more strategic and brain drainer.

I've played twice, and won twice.  Both times I played heavily to collecting sets of hanafudu cards, as well as sets of the other players cards.  I wonder if you can control the game and win the game with a substantial military effort.  Controlling the emperor is key, and I can see the possibility of expanding your actions through military, but it just seems hard to maintain.

There is a lot to absorb when you start your first game (lots of little rules, unusual mix of mechanics) and there is quite a bit of chaos, but this game is a lot of fun with the right group of 4 to 6 players. After your first turn, things will fall into place and you will start to feel the tension. Conquest is just as important as set collection, which is just as important as diplomacy. You can limit the diplomacy aspect to the exchange of cards, or leave the table with one of the other players to discuss tactics. Certainly an original title in my collection, and I am glad to own it. Very attractive components and full of theme.

Great fun! Unfortunately often there will be one or two runaway leaders, creating some Kingmaker-syndrome for the other players.

I just didn't like this game.  It is combination of a war game a set collection game with card trading in the middle.  The battles felt way too random as was the set collection.  There are some start positions on the board which are way more favorable than others.  All in all the game felt like it didn't fit together well.  All that said I only gave it one play and a game of this complexity probably needs more plays to truly assess it's merits.  This game however didn't grab me enough to get a second play.

Cool, but I have suspicions that it's flawed.  I love almost any game that involves trading, and when you put a map system with it, I like it even more.  The cards system feels a little tacked on, but I enjoy the way the three different cards interplay.  I'm not sure I like the initial difference between factions in card setup and board setup.  It strikes me as something that should be important, but it's really hard to see how a different card distribution will help you out, at least in your first game.  Also, I'm not sure that the military aspect provides a viable way to victory.  Still, I like the game well enough that I'm willing to give it another try.  There's potential here.  Whether it lives up to it is yet to be seen.

Lots of fun, but also very chaotic.  The timer is key to keeping the game moving, but I wish the negotiation round were just a smidge longer.

Diplomacy for people who don't like Diplomacy.  Light negotiations game themed around medieval Japan.  Light combat game. Light Euro elements of area control and trading cards.  So a bit of everything that seems to work together.

What a flawed, overproduced luck fest. And with downtime like you wouldn't believe. Why anyone would play that over Shogun is beyond me.
(And don't even get me started on the black & white dice, when colored dice were clearly the way to go...)

[i]Senji[/i]'s combat system is far too luck-oriented, to the extent that obtaining military cards can be a completely useless pastime.

Even if the mediocre combat system were modified or removed, you'd still be left with a canker sore* of uninspired, borderline autistic set-collection mechanics.  If you're not drawing Hanafuda cards every turn (often for all three actions), you're probably not doing well.

Finally, there's very little incentive to trade diplomacy cards (military cards, family cards, etc.) unless they're completely identical. So what's the point?

*Treating [i]Senji[/i] like a mouth ulcer improved my attitude dramatically. I became much more jovial once I applied a paste of baking soda and salt water to the board and figurines.

Interesting mix of diplomacy and war. Gaining honor equals victory points. The leader gets to identify the order the other players do their actions so you should not let one person get the lead and keep it. The diplomacy phase is other unusual mechanic. you basically trade cords which represent family members, army support or trade ships. The deals can be one sided or not. There is set collecting for gain honor or more samarai. Worth a couple more plays for sure.

Maybe the best game for my gaming group this year. It reminds me of A Game of Thrones and Wallenstein, kind of a mix between those two. It is faster to play though. Nice bits too and thematic with the different samurai's and their speciality.

设计挺新颖，但存在拖沓、不流畅的诟病（特指winter phase）；得分上主要依靠花牌的收集和发动战争；花牌的牌池够大，使得手牌的使用有丰富的组合；武士的概念在游戏中的表现还是挺有趣的……
最后想说下，玩了几盘，最深刻的感受就是，一旦某个玩家得分上遥遥领先，其他玩家一定要考虑联合对抗这个领先者，因为领先的玩家有控制天皇的权利，这会使其他玩家在执行行动指令时（summer phase）颇为被动。所以说若不想太早跪，玩家们就得适时地结盟来制衡对手。这也算是多少体现了一些战国时期的风云诡谲吧。

I'm new to wargames, but this is proving to be a great gateway game for me! The components are fabulous, the diplomacy is tense, and the strategy is deep. All the mechanics combine to form a game with some incredible variety. Senji is making an eager war gamer out of me!

The unique way of negotiating and making deals is the strength of this game.  Rest of game is OK if fairly routine.

I like this, but the "Diplomacy" style negotiation and backstabbing will leave a foul taste in some peoples' mouths.  It's also a little on the long side.  Oh, and my timer lasts over 10 minutes.

After 1 Play: I like the look of the game, but that's about it.  This is one of those games where your best bet to win is to happen to not be next to an overly aggressive player.  The set collection aspect also feels arbitrarily tacked on.

RATING: 5
A streamlined, simple game yet with an epic theme and feel. The mechanics are a bit tricky to teach and how to make deals/exchange cards isn't readily apparent, but once everyone gets into the mood (backstabbing, honor, promises, etc.), it works quite well. 

The artwork and components are excellent.

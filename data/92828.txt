The art is not as bad now that I have Dixit Journey mixed in.  It really stuck out badly before, but now there is enough variety in the drawing hands its ok.

Have really come to dislike the art, and the voting placards.  But I do like the modified bunny meeples and the new scoreboard.

more cards, wish it had extra voting chits instead of the stupid voting placards.  We do use the linear scoreboard as a matter of course now.

As with Dixit 2, this is more of the same really. Nice to be able to play with up to 12 players, perhaps the cards lack some of the fairy-tale wonder of the original but not noticeably so. Indeed, some are deliciously dark.

Dixit Odyssey delivers pretty much the same experience as the original Dixit. Beautiful art delivered in form of cards to excite the brain cells sensitive to visual cues.  Again the designers have kept their standards high regarding the art, which is very pleasing indeed. However, the pegs might be an issue depending on the edition. This is a shame since it should not be too hard to come up with alternative systems for voting (e.g. voting rondel similar to El Grande). Nevertheless, there are some nice touches as well such as the new box insert that stores the cards from a couple of expansions with ease. Moreover, the new score track is clearer to read than the one in the original.

There are no major changes in the mechanics which is pretty standard stuff, except for that now the game supports up to 12 players. Not sure how well that works, especially with 84 cards only. Still the fun stems from your own head and from your ability to immerse yourself into the world of lateral thinking. And the same is required from everyone you play with. Dixit is absolutely no fun if your gaming buddies are unimaginative law-and-order-bureaucrats who only see a picture but do not understand what it represents, or more importantly, could represent.

Dixit Odyssey comes with the same number of cards as the base game and thus has too few. You quickly begin to yearn for more variation from game to game and hence must be prepared to invest in an expansion or two.

+ 2012 Asmodee Special Cards.

Beautiful art and nice components for a cute party game. Dixit shows how a game can be extremely simple and still fun. It doesn't offer a lot of laughter, which may be a limit for a party game, but it can bring some good puzzles and a nice social experience.

Unfortunately Dixit has dropped a little for me over time. I used to play it a lot and I really liked it, but game after game I realized that my enjoyment depends terribly on the people around the table. It happened often to see round after round of obvious choices, when players were not creative enough and just said something to get over with their turn. My rating therefore goes from 8 to 6.5. I like it, but I want to play it with the right group.

Rating without the expansions: 6.

After 10 to 50 plays

We always play expansions as standalone versions and we don't shuffle basic and expansion decks together. These new card are better than "Dixit 2" cards and I enjoyed the possibility to play with more than 6 players. I'm missing the basic game board-box (the new board is cold and creepy) but it's good to have a box that can keep the three decks together.

I've yet to play the original, which I guess isn't all that different from Odyssey, apart from the ability to play with more players. It's a good game; but the variant rules are abominable.
How much you will enjoy the game depends VERY much on the group dynamics with which you're dealing.
It works with three.....but not very well.

I rated the original Dixit a 6 and this is just more of it.  

Production quality is decent.  I kind of miss the original's quirky score track even though Odyssey's is more practical.  Issues that others experienced with the peg boards appear to have been fixed by the printing of the game I had.  The artwork of Marie Cardouat remains charming and surreal.

RATING: 7
No prestige game. Everyone can play, even my wife. The best part of this game is the analysis afterwards. To hear what kind of associations people had that made them pick the card they did.

First and only experience with the Dixit series, and a pleasant one.  I can see this having much longer legs than Apples to Apples with regard to repeat plays, as the same card isn't necessarily the same card.  Might trade for a copy.  Breezy, creative family game.  Note: rating is for the base rules, it would appear, not the expansion ones.

Needless to say, a great game providing new play feelings that is not a game of strategy nor a game of luck. This is a game of imagination and expression.

One point I have to say is that this is a kind of content-consuming games. Second or third play with same card-set and same players would be a little more boring compared to the first play, so we have to find new players and/or buy expansion to keep the game fresh:)

Great party/family game! Gives lots of laughter and surprises. Especially with the right group of people. Very easy to learn, quick (about 30-60min) and (with extra cards) has almost infinite replayability, because one card can give so many associations. To me it's a "must have" for anyone who has friends ;)

A képek szerintem kevésbé ötletesek, mint a korábbi változatokban. A játék viszont több az elődöknél abból a szempontból, hogy lehet 12-en is játszani. A tábla jobb lett, a kártyák lepakolhatók mellé a számozott helyekre, így nincs tévedési lehetőség a kártyák beazonosításánál. A tippelésnél tetszik a 2 lehetőség (azt hiszem ez csak 6 fő felett van). Viszont a kis műanyag jelölők könnyen kiesnek a lyukból, hacsak nem fogjuk kézbe, vagy nem alulról tesszük be... ez elég amatőr megoldás szerintem.

Dixit is just great and Odyssey also accomodates more players than first Dixit. This combines the two famous finnish party games Alias and Rappakalja into a game that is both as fun as those and more accepted in the hardcoregamer circles than those. And Dixit has so nice pictures.

// More cards for Dixit. This doesn't really add much else

beyond that.

Dixit Expansion / Stand alone game.  I don't like the 'voting' method of the pegs + board, but I understand why they changed it from the tiles. I'll probably just use the tiles from the first game unless i'm playing with more than 6 players.

A perfect game for parties, very easy for beginners, everybody will enjoy it, but it will be very expansive because you need to buy more extensions to have more cards and better words and harder to guess when everybody is pro.

The cards for this are equally lovely as all the others available, but the highlight is the scoreboard and space in the box this frees up. Happily thrown the insert away to fit all my other stuff for this in, without then losing your only way to track everyone's score. The selection cards in this are worse in my opinion though, as you lose the tension of the storyteller revealing each number (and th surprises and laughter etc that comes with this) and it also makes it much more fiddly to manage who scored what each round. Still rate it a 10 as its mechanically flawless for me, and I just use the 6 selection tokens from the original Dixit games as I never play with more than 6 players anyway.

This game had potential.  Granted I am very direct and to the point with descriptions; A.K.A not a good game for me, I still wanted to give it a try.  After playing it a couple of times, it just didn't seem to work well with my game group.  Even the people that won in this game and did well didn't think this game deserved all the hype it had and wouldn't buy it for their own collections.

This one is a stand alone and extension in one. Some new rules, you can play couple of variants and with more people, but the idea is still the same - to guess what somebody had on mind while selecting card and saying sentence. Pictures on cards are quite different than those from Dixit and Dixit 2, i would say they are more difficult.

RATING: 5.5
I played Dixit Odyssey (with the scoring map and up to 12 players), but in all of my plays cards from Dixit 1, 2 and 3 have been mixed into the game, so I’ve just given the same rating for all of them. I think that the expansions are, unfortunately, essential as the few cards you get in one of the standalone games will quickly get into a rotation. Dixit shines when you don’t see the same cards often so you don’t have the same associations connected to specific cards (sure, you might still do, but with e.g. 300 instead of 100 cards, chances are that you won’t face too many of the same cards, and, furthermore, the other players will have a broader variety of cards of their own to pick from).

Dixit is a great game for kids and families as you really need to be creative and think outside the box! However, I’m not in the target group. I would definitely still play it with family, kids and non-gamers (which is exactly what I’ve done so far), but as a game there isn’t much to it. It’s more like an activity for creative minds, and it’s very good at that; it’s just not a game for me. If playing a “game” that isn’t really a game, I would much rather play Telestrations; it’s not a similar game at all, but Telestrations always make me laugh, it caters the same amount of players and it’s also a partygame/activity.

RATING: 6
Essentially the same as Dixit but with worse components. The scoreboard is an uninteresting straight line track with potential for mis-scoring due to the lack of solid lines and the player boards are badly designed (the pegs don't fit or stay in place).

Dixit Odyssey is a huge hit with my family and core gaming group. If I were to judge the game by its art alone, I would grade it a 10. The issue I have with the game however, is that its mechanics are oddly difficult to explain to new players.

People seem to have a hard time understanding that the Storyteller wants "some" people to guess the right card, but not "all" of them. Furthermore, the scoring in the game seems somewhat arbitrary and tends to confuse people who are playing for the first time. 

I am currently thinking of developing a house rule to make the scoring in Dixit more simplified. 

Final note: after playing Dixit two or three times you will have seen all the cards in the game. I am currently looking into buying the previous Dixit sets in order to increase the amount of cards in the deck, so that not every card is used in the game (which is practically inevitable in a 4+ player game).   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A step up from it's predecessors. It allows a new game mode called "party mode" which is a little better if you need to keep the game moving.

Other than that is is pretty much identical to the other Dixit games. It plays with slightly more players, which is a nice bonus and the new cards are still great as ever.

Add another 84 cards to Dixit and Dixit 2 and yet again, the fun increases. The rule that whoever reaches 30 points first, wins, is introduced so you can play with all cards combined without any problem.

The Odyssey theme is clearly present in most if not all cards of this expansion, yet they still fit nicely within the other sets due to the abstract nature of the cards.

The separate scoreboard is a beautiful addition.

The possibility to play with more players (12 maximum instead of 6) and the variants for such big games make the game more versatile.

Even without the prequels this game would be amazing; the prequels only add a lot of cards, really. But then: the more (cards), the merrier!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Odyssey adds more cards (yay!), a much better score track, some cool voting boards, and enough pieces for up to 12 players. It makes Dixit a better overall experience, hence the slightly higher rating. It is wonderful to mix the all of the Dixit cards together and not be able to predict what cards you will see.

My favorite base version of Dixit, mainly because of the scoring track. The voting works well in both editions. Gameplaywise (if this is a word), it's one of my favorite party games.

Even when playing with 7, I don't use the 7+ players scoring rules.

* Many people I have played with have said they have found the original artwork easier to play with and associate things too.
* Massive price for such few items

Desipite it's high price (no I don't think the artwork justifies a exorbarant price) it is a really good game and probably one of if not the best party games you can get.

RATING: 4
Party game where players have to guess which is the storyteller's picture.  Played in terms where each turn a player becomes the storyteller.  They select a picture from their hand of cards, and say a sound or phrase relating to that picture.  The other players try to select a picture that best fits the storyteller's phrase.  Cards are collected, shuffled, displayed, then players select what they think the storyteller's card was.  Points are awarded based on picks, with the storyteller wanting someone to pick their card, but not everyone.  Fun game that works - very much in the style of Barbarossa and Apples To Apples.  The Odyssey box is nice in that it holds all the cards from the first game, plus expansion. Also, there is a nice score boards included, as well as selection boards rather than the chips for guessing.  A slight disappointment is the backs of the new cards are slightly different, so you can tell which cars set you are drawing.

Another good addition to the base game that expands it up to 12 players.  Mind you they could have thought out the way that you select your guess for the round a bit better.  The peg and board arrangement really doesn't work that well.

Plays for this are wrapped up in the Dixit entry.

Great game that can be played with both young and old people. The great thing about this game is that everybody likes it for a different reason.

And that's what makes this game awesome

RATING: 6.14
Cards are not that well drawn as in previous expansions but it offers nice storage solution, neat score board and voting system that supports up to 12 players.

[b]Edit:[/b] It turned out later that storage is not suitable at all for the sleeved cards, so I had to cut my storage trey with scalpel.
And scoring rabbits and voting treys are not very important if you use pen and paper to keep scores and if you have your own voting system. My group prefers using numbered tokens so we have to make our own custom tokens in order to support more than 6 players.
Mild addition overall.

At first read, this game seemed to be, first and foremost, about coming up with semi-vague clues.  After several plays though, I'm thinking it's more about knowing your opponents, and exploiting what you know about them to target clues at them.  Like most games I love, it's all about knowing the people sitting at the table, and games like that are my jam.

My comment for Dixit applies here as well. 

[i]While your enjoyment of this game may depend greatly on who you play it with, this is not some mere party game. There's a fair amount of skill and creativity involved to play a good game of Dixit. I'm highly impressed how the designer compressed it all into one compact game.[/i]

But not so hot about the changes here. I'm not sure about playing with 12 - seems way excessive and makes Dixit like some kind of random party game. The voting board is probably a result of not wanting to mess around with 12 voting chits but is definitely less aesthetically pleasing.

I'd played the first Dixit a few times before trying this.  It's an improvement in that the components make it easier to allocate numbers to cards for voting, and that it allows for more players.  I did miss the cutsy field scoring track, though; it looked very odd sending the poor multi-coloured bunnies through a steampunk nightmare!

A sort of inverse Apples to Apples. Players still choose the card they think best fits, but so does the player whose turn it is. Everyone else tries to guess which of cards is the active player's, after that player comes up with a verbal clue, anything from a song lyric, movie quote, book title, or any random choice of words. He could even hum a tune. This clue is based on his interpretation of one of the beautifully, fantastically illustrated cards in his hand.

Anyone who has trouble placing or coming up with such cues will probably not enjoy this game so much, unless they have at least one other player who understands how they think.

I highly recommend this as a party game for creative individuals. The expansions make replay all the better.

A Dixit volt a tökéletes családi játék, az Odyssey pedig a tökéletes partijáték! Fedőnevek ide/oda, ehhez a játékhoz még mindig több társasszűz embert lehet leültetni! (A hozzáadott kártyák nem a legjobb széria, még szerencse, hogy milliónyi kártya szerezhető be hozzá).

Fun game that you can teach in 5 minutes.  Impressive how such a simple game can be so entertaining.  The biggest flaw in this game is that it needs more cards.  After a couple plays you have seen all the cards and make the same connections with the artwork if you are playing with the same group.  Or worse...  you are playing with some of the same group so you can give the same clues for your card and you are guaranteed to have at least one person pick it.

It's a great gateway game, and it's great for all ages. Played it with all ages, from my friend's 8 year old to my grandma who just turned 88 this year.

Only downside to it (though this is more a people problem than game) is that "targeting" another player with your clue is not expressly forbidden - though I've houseruled that it is.

What I mean by "targeting" is coming up with a clue that you know only one other person will get, such as giving your SO's pet name as a clue when you're playing together with others.

2011

I rated the base game a 9, and since this improved the game a lot, I have rated it a 10, as an expansion. As a stand alone game I rate it only a 7.  As an expansion, increasing the number of player to 12, and adding a lot more cards, is great because we have played with more than 6 (the maximum number of players for the base game) on several occasions, and improvised--our comment at that time, we needed more cards!!  So when playing this as a stand alone game, twelve is too many--the cards are cycled through too often.

Now there is a much better score board, and the board has numbered slots for the cards that are laid out so that there is no question which end card is #1.  

As mentioned, more cards are added, which we were all hungry for, and again the art work is good, although I like the art work better in Dixit and Dixit 2.  (Some of them looked a little unfinished to me.)

The voting boards are a great addition.  The insert is another improvement and held the cards of all 3 editions.  However, if you sleeve the cards as I did, sadly they won't fit.

A great game just got better.

Acquired January 2012

After playing the original Dixit a few times, we decided to get this game, so we could all play at the same time (8 of us). I'm not wild about the scoring board (not easy to tell which rabbit is on which number, with lots of players), but it is very good to have the numbered slots for laying out the cards. The pegboard voting cards are were not a good idea. A much better idea would have been to have a wheel card with 12 numbers and a hole to reveal the vote. But, regardless of the design shortcomings, the game is much fun. The fantasy art cards are very amusing and thought-provoking, and it is fun to figure out an appropriate clue as the storyteller.

Great game for non-gamers or non-serious gamers.  Personally, I found that it moved a little slow, and the scorekeeping is a bit confusing.  But great game none-the-less, everyone I know enjoys it.  Odyssey has a better scoring track, supports up to 12 players and you can choose between twelve colours (yes, this is important!).  Art is a bit worse, bit still very very good.

Dixit plays very well with 7+ players, so this is a straight improvement on normal Dixit. I like guessing for 2 cards since that somewhat limits the AP and makes it more common for everyone to guess correctly. The new board for guessing works well and the score track, while less unique, is at least smaller and clearer.

Wait, I played this before, it was called Apples to Apples!  Same mechanic with a twist.  Played once, and was kind of "meh..."  Partly it might have been the group, but somehow, everyone but one person would guess the storyteller's card, and with two votes, the person who got lucky enough to have the best card would get three more points...  Ended up being too luck driven to matter much as to thinking about the cards.  I will have to try it again, but the first impression wasn't deserving of Spiel des Jahres.

The same Dixit game with unnecessary "improvements". Playing Dixit with 12 players is not a good idea in my opinion, even 8 players is too much. In such case you are story teller for one or maximum two times per game, which ruins this game. However you can still play 4-6 player game as in original Dixit. Other "improvement" are player boards - much worse than original Dixit tiles. Cards and central scoring board are good enough though and can be considered as real additions in Dixit. I suggest you - don't play this game with more than 6 players if possible.

Everyone loves Dixit! Except for the people who own it, that is. I will play it if everyone asks for it, but I'd rather play something else with non-gamers (King of Tokyo, Deep Sea Adventure or Mysterium). Hard to beat the 12 player cap though!

Tried the teamplay variant but it didn’t rally work for me.  The decisions presented were not dissimilar to vanilla Dixit.  There was no sense that intelligent partnership would determine victory.  And I prefer the box inset score track and the number chits of the original to the peg boards and score tracker of this edition.  What’s going on with that anyway?  Rabbits racing through a plumber’s nightmare?

A dobozos Dixit dobozos testvére.
Az új játéktáblával könnyebb a nyuszik kezelése, kisebb a dőlésveszély (bár nekem az eredeti pontozótábla grafikája nagy kedvenc). Megjelenik a csapatjáték és aki meri, már 12 fővel is játszhatja a játékot.
Mindezek kiszolgálására pontozólapkák is kerültek a játékba. Egyetértek mások véleményével, ez a legrosszabbul sikerült része a doboznak, mintha be sem tesztelték volna. Azért mindig megoljduk valahogy.

I've played this with many people now and with some streamlined voting rules the game moves by fast enough. we just place a divit in the card and lay it down over the card we voted for. it makes the game fly because we can all tally our scores at once. I've ultimately rated it a 9 because after 15-20 plays with a similar group people begin to lose interest when card novelty wears off. That make a bit pricey for a mixer/lighter game

[ES] Buen juego filler que solo necesita de imaginacion para ser divertido, incluso para los mas novatos. Las ilustraciones son muy sugerentes  y se prestan a muchas reglas internas (solo peliculas, solo canciones, etc). Mi unica pega es que las cartas se hacen demasiado familiares en muy poco tiempo, lo que hace muy necesaria la compra de expansiones.

Dixit is the perfect party game. Extremely easy to put on the table and the rules can be explained in seconds. My favourite thing is to give the names of other players as my clues which takes our group of friends to the perfect mood where everyone's cracking jokes about one another. The game does need 4 or more players to really shine. 3p game doesn't really work.

I'm giving Odyssey only a 7, though. Apparently there are variations with these editions but I got this one due to it enabling a larger player count. But the card images are absolutely horrible. They are full of weird science fiction images of metallic cubes, gargoyles and "things" with floating bubbles with more weird stuff inside them. I've replaced almost all of the Odyssey images with the cards from expansions.

RATING: 7
Among my games, Dixit has one of the most creative gameplay mechanics. In it, a storyteller is tasked with describing an abstract piece of art in a word or a sentence that at least one but not all the players are able to guess which is the storyteller's.

As a result of this mechanic, the description of the same card will inevitably vary due to the storyteller's insight into the other players' knowledge of their potential clues.

While the game plays our much like Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, the winner is not determined at random, but by the individual's own cleverness and ability to size up his opponents.

Unfortunately, the game cycles through the picture cards very quickly so expansions from the original, Dixit 2, and Dixit 4 seem necessary. Additionally, you cannot buy the cards alone so you'll end up buying extra game pieces, boards, etc.

Basically the same game as Dixit, so therefore also a great game. This has slightly different components and supports up to 12 players using a variant set of rules. This variant does not seem good though and I prefer to use a 7+ player variant I found on BGG instead.

If deciding whether to get this or Dixit, I would get this, the insert is better for storing expansions.

Great artwork and really fresh idea. Amazing how many people like it, even my mother who NEVER plays board games wanted to join when she saw us playing. BUT there is one major flaw: once you have played it a couple of times with the same person(s), it is very difficult to describe a card without that person instantly knowing the right answer from previous plays, something that really hurts the replayability. Other than that, a great game.

Enjoyability wise I'd give this a 5 or a 6 but it gets major points for expanding out to 12 players. It's a good party game for a large group of friends, but bear in mind that if you play it a bit with the same group you will get a lot of repeat cards and memory will start to play a factor. Probably best with some card expansions, but I haven't bothered investing in those yet.

Dixit is a fantastic party game and one of my favorite light weight fillers. It requires such creativity and imagination, and the cards feature some of the most evocative artwork ever seen in games. It's a must for any collection.

Version Ranking: 2/6
Odyssey is neck and neck with Journey for the best artwork in the series. While I enjoy Journey's style more, Odyssey definitely has the best variety of colors, subjects, and ideas. If I had to pick just one version to get, this would be it. Favorite card - Television Knight

:thumbsup: fantastic illustrations

The optimal strategy is to either give a targeted inside-reference to a friend, or give a random clue that has nothing to do with the card you play, so that it's impossible for [i]all[/i] of your opponents to choose your card. To counter this, your opponents' best play is to do the same thing, effectively making Dixit completely broken or random. Is this strategy against the "spirit of the game?" I don't care. Any rules implemented to disable this strategy are unenforceable.

The cards in this game could be used for an interesting variant of Codenames: Pictures

Initial Rating: 8.0 (April 2013)

I have only played this with the regular Dixit rules. I have not played with more than 6 players and/or the teams option. As soon as I do I will comment on them (although I think I won’t like to play with so many players).

This is a great game (and a must buy) for me. This adds 84 new cards to Dixit. As I have played with the base game many times, some patterns had emerged over time, so having new art is a huge plus. 

I dislike the new player boards with the pegs, they look great at the beginning but with continued play they begin to degrade rather quickly. The motion to put and remove the pegs damage the player boards in an unacceptable (for me) manner. I prefer the vote tokens from the base game. 

For now the game is an 8.0 to me just for the cards, they have great art. I’m intrigued by the teams variant but I don’t want to play the game with more than 6 players, if I ever do I will comment on my experience.

Current Rating: 8.0

I played with the rules for more than 6 players. At first I didn’t like them very much. With 7 players these rules practically ensures you will get the right card as (most of the time) you are really deciding between a couple of cards, but I can see this is a plus when you have 9+ players. Besides you also have the possibility to choose only one card to get an extra point. I like them.

Doesn't really add that much to the game, so I rate it the same as the base game.  The new variants look interesting, and I'd like to try them.  

The new scoring method and track are way cleaner and definitely improve on the base game.  I also like the box design, which allows you to hold all of the cards.  On the other hand, the art is not as evocative or convincing as the original cards.  But they still work, so I'm satisfied with this as an expansion.

"If I can't figure out how to play the game better the next time, I'd rather play something else." - Ryan Sturm, making a general comment about games.

You can't figure out how to play Dixit better the next time. It just doesn't work like that. 

Other people have fun with Dixit. They like the ambiguity and uncertainty in the art, they admire the pictures themselves, and they somehow bond over the various interpretations. I don't begrudge them that enjoyment at all, but I’m one of the 1% or 2% of people with afantasia, so I can’t say what the cards depict unless I’m looking at them. I find the art repellant rather than attractive, and the activity (to me it isn't even a game) the opposite of fun. In short, it's a hot mess.   

If you want to play Dixit, that's perfectly fine. Just don't make me play. I’d much rather just watch.

Party game of saying silly stuff to describe silly cards. Pretty fun and gorgeous to look at.
Score system is kinda... just mathsy enough that I don't want to explain it. So I'm the only one that can give scores, which means I have to ask everyone what they voted for and what was their card again and... kinda slows things down.

RATING: 8
The problem here is very simple. The pegs fall out of the board. You have to cover them up with your hand while you choose your answers. It's a simple matter of mechanical engineering that someone should have picked up on before this game went to press.

That said, more Dixit! I like that the game gives you enough selection boards for more players - there was no reason whatsoever that the original game was only made to accommodate six people. Great fun.

This is a party game, nothing less or more. A good laugh which non-gamer types can easily join into. Imaginative and devoid of mathematical/risk assessment thinking, it's a kind of perfumy woolly ball of a game attached to a cuddly kitten. However, this really is not a top 100 game.....

This is probably the version of Dixit to buy first, since it supports up to 12 players (the only one that has this, I believe) and has a couple new modes of play, if you wish to use them.  Up to 12 players now makes this TRULY a party game!  :-D  It also has the little peg-boards that you vote with, which I prefer to the little tiles.  There are also several slots in the box for you to add cards from other expansions, so you can carry everything in one box.  Unfortunately, this version is more expensive than any other Dixit product for some reason.  Is it rarer?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
One of the best party games I played ever. Easy to grasp and at the same time bringing loads of fun. Very good played with people whom you know very well as well as with complete strangers. 

Another advantage is the fact it can now be played with up to 12 people. Even thought a dozen of players is quite a bunch now it doesn't loose any of it kicks. 

Highly recommended option and a must have especially if your friends/family are no hard core players.

More Dixit, but comes with a nice insert to store multiple expansions and with enough components to accommodate up to twelve players.

Cool game. The components are far better than Dixit 1, but I have a problem with the "play until one of the players has 30 points"-rule. When a player is about to win, the other players try to guess wrong on purpose, so he doesn't get more points. The Dixit 1 rules where you just play till the deck is empty didn't have this strategic weakness.

We have Dixit, D. Quest, and D. Odyssey. D. Odyssey seemed to have several cards with darker themes that were more difficult to play discretely than the usual whimsical ones. It is still a great addition, but I'd remove a few cards if I were playing with children or particularly sensitive adults. 

One card in particular, for instance, has a young  blindfolded and handcuffed girl that is shushing the viewer with a finger to her mouth. Another one features an adult ogre figure holding a little boy's hand and walking towards the dark woods. For the latter, the storyteller's clue was "911," and the other four players at the table voted for it right away (ignoring flood and tornado cards).

This game reminds me of the Eurovision song contest - strange images are put in front of you, a long process of deliberation and then predictably a member who belongs to the largest bloc of voters, in this case families or close friends rather than ex--Soviet or Nordic blocs, wins.

The only upside is that it plays quicker than the Eurovision song contest, is unlikely to bankrupt you or draw attention to your civil rights record.

It's fine as a means of getting more cards. I don't think the system for voting is as simple and elegant as Dixit (original) or Journeys, which has returned to the game's more manageable limit of 6 players. So I wouldn't use this as a starter set, but it's a fine expansion and if for some unspeakable reason you want to play with 6-12 people I guess it's the only way to do so out of a box.

The component quality is not as nice as the original Dixit (or at least, the edition we have). Chinese manufacture means the paint on the wooden rabbits is too opaque and has a rough "matte" feel, and the quality of the card-stock is lesser. These may seem like nitpicky details to some, but I love my game bits. However, the difference in card-stock could impact on those who wish to combine sets.

The rules for playing with up to 12 are an improvement, and though the scoring track is less attractive and cute than the one in Dixit, it is certainly more functional. The components for voting have been overhauled, and the numbered chips are replaced with a voting card with numbered holes, into which players can insert pegs for a first and second preference. Sadly, the choice of a red/green combination for the pegs will cause problems for colourblind players in the 7-12 player version of the game.

Overall, there are some enhancements to the rules and functionality of the components that make this game an improvement, but aesthetically, in terms of both the components and the more inspired card art, Dixit and Dixit 2 are better. Nevertheless, I'd probably recommend this as the starting point for someone.

I avoid playing this with adults. They are lacking imagination. On the contrary, I really love it when the gaming session involves children (mine, obviously :D). The same applies for the original Dixit as well.

Same thoughts as the base game. Offers a different board, more players and other options. And more cards. Nice mix all round and so balances out to be the same score as original.

Good expansion, more cards, better board, bunnies that don't fall. The vote system is well resolved but if we are 4,5 or 6 playing I always use the old system. It's nice that you can play with more than 6 with odyssey but with more than 8 it can turn chaotic. Too bad that sleeved cards don't fit in the insert.

Dixit sets out to do something unusual, and does it perfectly. That it can do it with 12 players, and be unlike other high player-count games I've played, is fantastic.

The cart artwork is beautiful and intriguing. The way it balances points and closes up the pack during play is masterful. In our first game, the player who was consistently behind for the first half came from behind and took second in the end.

This is everything I wish Apples to Apples (and related games) were.

I have to ding the components for including orange, red, pink, and purple, each pair of which is much too close to each other. But apart from that, it's a lovely package -- and the insert is fantastic (provided you keep the sprues to stick under it!).

Beyond the additional cards (which is always nice) this expand-alone adds the possibilty of playing with up to twelve players. Helping me bring out Dixit with larger groups? Yes please!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Awesome game with a big group! I've played with as many as 8. Anything between 5 and 8 is great! The game is super light and fluffy, but a whole lot of fun with the right group! IMO, Dixit Odyssey is the version to own. You can argue about art all day, but this one is the only version that allows more than 6 to play!

Update 3/20/16: 

Played this over a long weekend with my mom and other family. She's an artist, which I thought would draw her into the gameplay. Geez was I right, in a big way! She loved this game, saying it was one of her favorites of all time. That said, this game is not for everyone. If you are extremely left-brained and linear in thought, it might not be your cup of tea. But if you have a playful imagination and think that being creative is fun, then you should definitely give this game a look.

Not quite as good art as original, but this is of course 100% subjective as it's not badly drawn or anything. Decent amount of details too. The original scoring track is prettier too, but you can play this with 7-12, and it works! Awesome! Best mixed with original and/or Dixit 2, in 7p+ games you'll run out of cards and have to reshuffle if you have just one deck..

RATING: 7
Rated as a stand-alone game.  Better than Dixit in that it supports more players.  I prefer the art of the base game.  It gets more "oohs and aahs" with new players.

But...  love the new box, peg boards work with more players, board works better with more players... so use it as an expansion and keep both games together.  I'd up the rating to a 8+ with both together.

RATING: 8
Balderdash with pictures.   Fun game - success really depends on knowing the group well, and being creatively cryptic but not too obvious for all players.

Doesn't slow down with larger numbers.  Great for non gamers and plays very differently depending on who you are playing with. .  Excellent artwork.  Works a very different part of the brain than the standard Eurogame.

Includes the cards from Dixit 2 (aka Dixit Quest):  http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/55660/dixit-quest

RATING: 7
Standalone expansion that supports up to 12 people and has a more practical board than that of the base set. The artwork of the base set is a lot more fun to play with, because it's more abstract and has more tiny details hidden in it. You can mix the sets up to make a bigger deck, but beware: there is nothing on the cards to help quickly identify which card is from which set.

Holds my base game and a few expansions. Nice alternative standalone version for more players. The voting boards are rubbish, the score tracker is less error probe but also not as cute as the meadow in "Dixit 1" and the art is not quite as imaginative as the original. At least the rabbit meeples can stand on their own now. Very good to expand the base game and to get a bigger box to hold more cards but I would recommend the original Dixit to a newbie who is not planning to expand the game from the get go.

RATING: 8
Excellent game! Has become a favourite on the table, and I've accidentally influenced two friends after two games to go out and buy their own copies. The start of the game can be a bit tricky, but soon you start getting more inventive. The game shines after the first 10 minutes or so of play, however veteran players probably won't find this delay. The only issue is that cards begin to repeat themselves ar too quickly (even within the same game at times), so I've picked up Dixit and Dixit 2 to add much more variety to an otherwise enjoyable game.

Totally did not live up to the hype for me...although the game was played under less than ideal conditions.  This was the boardgame disappointment of the year for me in 2016.

We only had 4-5 players, and it feels like this game would be more engaging if there were 7 or 8 players participating.

We also had lots of distractions on both occasions we played - with people walking away from the table to attend to kids, etc.  

Overall, this was a frustrating experience...

I love dixit but this is surprising inferior to the original. 

A truely boring and ugly board.

Terrible voting system with pegs making it both fiddly, difficult to keep them hidden and disappointing in game wirh smaller numbers.

The art is fine but for the most part it reproduces the Dixit and Dixit 2 cards or at least fails to stand on its own.

12 bunnies is great but the colour choices are too dark and unvarried.

In short for veterans this may offer a bit of disappointment.

Dixit 1. kiegészítő (és alapjáték egyben)

12 játékosra bővíti az alapkiadást és végre egy normális pontozótáblát is sikerült belerakni, cserébe viszont a tipp-tábla lett nagyon béna a 12 lyukával együtt.

A kártyái szerintem viszont hajszállal jobbak az alapjáték kártyáinál.

Az alap Dixit sikerének köszönhetően kellettek az új lapok, sőt ebben a verzióban már 12-en lehet játszani + a szabályokon is csavarnak (bár ezt mi nem próbáltuk).

Not really convinced on the new way of voting.  It's not as fun as flipping a voting card.  Also more players isn't as fun as I thought it would be.

Haven't tried the new way of playing either, as it doesn't sound that appealing.

More cards. I like the art just as much as the base game. HOWEVER - this gets a bit of a bonus over the base game as it increased the number of players to 12. We played with more than 6 usually anyway (just needed something else to vote and keep score with), and the 12 bunny meeples and voting cards make a good addition to the game.

I don't like Apples to Apples and this game sounded very similar. As it turns out, though, I find Dixit to be quite fun.  As the active player, it's a challenge to come up with a clue that is legitimate without being too obvious. As one of the other players, it's a challenge to come up with a card that is likely to fool your fellow players into thinking that yours was the card the clue referred to, thus earning some extra points. The quality of the cards is good, although they are over-sized and difficult to shuffle.  The artwork is suitably weird and wonderful, inspiring lots of odd associations. (4 + 3)

for me this game really shines when played with people you don't know so much because you can gain an insight into their minds, or with people you know and do not play it with them often (after a while certain associations are created and fixed and then it's just not that fun). the best thing about this game is the conversations that explain who selected which card and why. i think that the scoring isn't really necessary and it's more fun to just play it for the stories you can create. best thing is, when you go on holiday with people who usually don't play board games you don't need to take the box with you, just take the cards alone, play it as you like and have fun. really only downside is, that it can get repetitive quickly

This edition comes with storage for base Dixit and new cards. It also has components added for party and team versions of play. If you sleeve your cards, this storage is really not adequate. I thought it would be, was dissapointed to discover the cards barely fit in the trays. I have now made my own box dividers, removed the box insert and have room for all cards from Dixit, Dixit 2, Odyssey, Journey and all components...plenty of room to spare too.

Yay, Dixit Odyssey! One of the best party games around! And Paulo's most hated game! What I love so much about this game is that it's completely reliant on the group you play with. So I tend to think it's fun in any setting where gaming isn't the main focus, ie., holidays with the family or other non-gaming situations in your life. Dixit Odyssey is the same version of Dixit, but made expressly for more than six players (in fact, it goes up to twelve! Gosh, that sounds fun! Twelve players!) The art is fantastic because it is beautiful and surreal enough that everyone sees and picks up something different in every card. Sidenote: I believe Dixit is a game about art and how people derive meaning from images: there are no points if everyone understands your clue or if no one understands your clue. Art is not democratic nor is it math. Dixit should be played in any and every gaming or non-gaming meetup! Always great fun and so beautiful, too!

A clever party game reliant on analysis and intuition but can also reward guessing. Game comes with a deck of beautifully bizarre illustrated cards although I find this deck difficult to work with. The scoreboard is an improvement over Dixit but the point marking bands are too narrow plus the pawns remain top-heavy.

Extension to the story telling, card choosing game Dixit, Includes additional artwork (84 new cards). Allows for more players than the original and has some interesting rules variants, the basic game rules probably still work the best but the components allow for choosing the story tellers card more easily with multi players . Like the original a very solid and fun game.

Dixit Odyssey expands the Dixit concept a little bit, allowing up to 12 players, changing the scoring a little, and adding a new scoring track.  The 6-player limit can be a little constricting for a party game like Dixit, so this is certainly a welcome addition.  While the new card art is not all done by Cardouat, it maintains the game's fantastic feel.  I'd probably suggest this over the original Dixit as a first purchase, but if you want to play more than 6, you're going to want more cards for the additional variety anyway.

Although I find the pictures from Dixit Odyssey not being as good as those from basic Dixit, it's still nice addition especially if you want to play Dixit with more than six players. While speaking of the ilustrations those seem to me a bit too straight forward and i see people having more problem finding ideas for their cards. This is why I scored Dixit Odyssy lower than regular Dixit.

Additionally voting pads from Dixit Oddysey ain't that easy too use as the voting tokens from Dixit so when I play with less than six players I prefere to use tokens.

All the Dixit you will ever need. Compared to the other three, I would have to argue some of the art on the cards seems to depict less fantasy and more human interaction, giving the game a bit of a more adult theme. Might be my impression. In any case, the fact that you can now play with twelve people really increases the chances of this game popping up more often.

A kártyák hasonlóak az előző verziókhoz, de azért van egy két változtatás a "sima" Dixit-hez képest.
6 helyett 12 személyes, illetve nem kártyákkal választ az ember a lehetőségek közül, hanem egy speciális jelölő kártyával, amibe a megfelelő helyen bele kell tűzni egy jelölőt. 

update:
Illetve van mód a csapatjátékra is.

update2:
Játszottunk a csapatjátékkal. A szabályok annyiban változnak, hogy a "Mesélő" párja is ad egy lapot, illetve a többi páros megbeszélheti, hogy közülük ki adjon lapot a közös csomagba. (persze úgy, hogy a többiek is hallják). Értelemszerűen tippelésnél a másik fél tippeli meg, hogy melyik kártya a mesélő kártyája.
Természetesen csapatjátékban csak 1 figurával lépnek a csapatok.

Essentially Dixit 2.0 as it plays almost the same. This version allows you to have 12 players active and keep score but 8-10 seems to be the sweet spot. All new cards and there is a larger insert for storing cards (unsleeved fit better but depending on your sleeve, they can still fit fine). Only gameplay difference is for scoring if you use two votes as opposed to just one. More of the great art this series has continually put out and you have a game that plays many and is light-hearted enough to be a good time. Has been out of print at times so it's availability varies but with the only text being the instructions, any language will do as the PDF rulebook can be downloaded online.

31-08-2014. Rated after 3 plays of various Dixit versions. I am not sure where I stand on this game. IF it's your turn, you play a card and hint/make a story/sing a song that you think symbolizes something on the card you've played. Other players than play a card that they think is similar. Players than vote on which card they think was from the original player. If no one guesses correctly, all other players gain two points. If at least one player guesses correctly both original player and correct guesser gain 3 points. So basically you want to be obscure, but not too obvious. 

I am not sure what I think about this game. I think it's ok, but it'll never become a game that I really, really, really enjoy.

RATING: 8
Dixit is a social game. Players take turns in playing cards and giving a corresponding hint. The other players will then each add a card of their own to the mix and when all the cards have been shuffled and revealed all players (except the hint giver) will guess which card has been played by whoever gave the hint. Simple mechanic that allows anyone to participate and have fun. Great game to bring out when looking to include 'non-gamers'.

This is a themed version of Dixit, not compatible with the basic game, which is quite a setback. The base game of Dixit is one of the most popular Board Game here. I see no point bringing out an independant expansion. The cardbacks are different. However, you can still apply some of the mechanics to the Basic Game, such as the 6+ players version.

I will only rate this one.  The Dixit games are phenomenal party games, and a blast to play. Basically this game is like Apples to apples with pictures.  If you plan on buying this game start with odyssey and go backwards.  This has components for 12 and is much better quality than what comes in the original.  Dixit 2 is just more cards.

Idealna gra na spotkania w większym gronie (może grać nawet do 12 osób).

Jedna z tych gier, w które można pograć chyba z każdym - jak do tej pory nie spotkałem chyba osoby, której by się nie podobała.

RATING: 8
Dixit is a unique party game experience that involves communicating successfully creatively through cryptic messages. The game changes with different players as you try and tailor your descriptions to the player, but I have found that those who play literally do not take as much away from this game as those who play intuitively. Odyssey allows up to 12 players, but is still probably best with around 5-6 players. At 12 players, the game becomes too mixed and all too easily about luck than successful communication. Cards also run out very quickly. In the same vein, the replayability of the game is initially high, but there is only so many times one can describe the same card in a cryptic manner. The other expansions are a much needed investment if you are going to get this game.

RATING: 2
I rate basic Dixit much higher. 

The reason for different rating is simple: different art. It might seem harsh, I mean the quality of art really has no function here, this is not to say I like this or that art style better. It's about functionality of the art. The point of Dixit cards are to give you something you can work with, not only follow one's weird train of though or association, but particularly the cards are better if they allow for weird pop-culture or whatever references some people will know, but not everybody. And here I find the original art much more open and usable and the new one more artificial and gimmicky. It might be just me and it can be a personal bias.

As for the 12 players, scoring pads and a track. Aesthetically I prefer the original (also it's more practical - here you're constantly asking "everybody voted yet?"). And given how Dixit is a game that seems better at lower counts, I'm fine with the base game. 

EDIT: I just dislike this scoring board (brown!) and these illustrations do not work for me. Original artist or nothing. Marie Cardouat should be credited as a codesigner of Dixit as only her illustrations really work and make the game.

Valóban hihetetlen, hogy 2011-ben így jelenhessen meg egy játék, hogy a jelölők a szavazólapok asztalra helyezése esetén nem maradnak meg rendesen a lapon. Nem tudom ez teszteléskor, hogyan nem tűnt fel. Az viszont mindenképpen dicséretes, hogy az alapjáték és az első kiegészítő lapjainak van hely a dobozban és minden pontosan elfér.

[2011-09-06]
Amit még hibának lehet felróni a kivitelezés kapcsán, hogy a pontozótábla egyes részei jobban elkülönülhetnének egymástól, mert könnyen elcsúsznak rajta a nyuszik.
A lapok viszont nagyon jól sikerültek. Az alapjáték és az Odyssey lapjai a legjobbak, kicsit maradnak el tőlük az Dixit 2 kártyái. A kivitelért nem vonok le pontot, mert úgy érzem nem lenne teljesen jogos egy ilyen játék esetében, illetve szerintem későbbi kiadásokban biztosan orvosolni fogják ezeket. Az egyik legjobb partijáték továbbra is, immár 12-en is leülhetnek mellé.

[2013-01-05]

I can't understand why they redesign the scoring system for this game.
Although the 80 new cards are as good as in the two other releases (the cards alone will score a 9), someone decided that create a new score system where you have two tokens and you need to put them in a perforated piece. The whole system is very uncomfortable, hard to use and unpractical. It would have been MUCH better if they were just stick to the original pieces with numbers.

Just like Dixit, only more-so. Here's my review of Dixit:

I typically describe this game to friends a Apples to Apples with French surrealist artwork. While it isn't necessarily the best description of the game, it tends to get people on board quickly.

Like Apples to Apples this is a game about knowing the people you play with. It has a slightly more complicated scoring system that, in practice, creates a nice tension between making clues too difficult and too easy. There's a sense of creative license here that simply isn't found in Apples to Apples and is found to a still-lesser extent in Cards Against Humanity. And it's that combination of solid, tested party-game mechanics with creative spice that makes this game so brilliant at the table.

I feel like this game is deserving of a ten. The artwork alone makes me think I'll always enjoy leafing through the cards ... we'll see how I feel in a half-year or so.

So, the box holds three packs of cards and the bits from the original Dixit, the art work was done by the excellent Marie Cardouat so it matches Dixit and Dixit 2 which we already had (rather than the later art work which is not so appealing to us).  It was the obvious expansion to make.

I love tis game. You can play it with everybody. And everybody I played this game with really enjoyed it. The beautifull artwork is a cool bonus offcourse. The artwork of Odyssy I like the least but since it's a great plus to play this with so many people I choose this version.

Buy it for the cards. I've tried to play a 7 player game and the scoring becomes so chaotic that it detracts from the game experience.
Basic Dixit scoring works a lot better as players can place their tokens next to their guess and then it's easy for one player to adjust scores. I also prefer to get more story teller opportunities and with more than 6 players you only get a couple per game.

Feeling a bit of Dixit Fatigue lately, but that's just because it's works so well with so many people, gamers and non-gamers alike.  I really feel that it has the potential to be one of the new gateways.  

Odyssey's new scoring track and rules for larger groups are both very welcome.  I also prefer the scoring pegs to the voting tokens.  Though not reflected in the rating, I'm also VERY grateful that this game was built to hold Dixit 1 and 2 as well.  Nice touch!

'Dixit 1.1' - fixed all the issues of the original: Material for 12 players including rules adjustments to allow multiple votes when playing with more than 6 players. Also, room for tree set of cards (unsleeved - fits also sleeved cards but a litte fewer). Seperate scoring track. 84 new cards compared to the original version. Get both!

2011-06-14 -- Can't wait to play Dixit with 12!

2011-10-11 -- I've played Dixit plenty enough to be done with it. I own it because it's a great game for pulling people in that are allergic to gaming in general. I even got my mom to play a game of Dixit once. I recently added Dixit: Odyssey to my collection because I wanted to have some new artwork to look at, get a component upgrade, and play it with more players. The surprise was that there are new variants and rules that actually added to the game. In particular, the rule that the storyteller gets to negate one card every round, adds an interesting twist. Dixit alone gets a 5 rating. Dixit: Odyssey gets a 6.5. Still nothing I love per se, but a good game to own for the right settings.

RATING: 6.5
I rated Dixit and Dixit 2 a 9.

I have purposely held off buying Dixit 3 as the artwork is clearly inferior and it does not lend itself to storytelling the way the previous artwork did.  I will only buy it to cherry pick a few cards worthy of its predecessors and to get the board and voting cards.  I am not in a hurry to do this however and I will only buy it when I find a cheap copy.

Update:  Got this as a gift.  I have bumped the rating up from 5 to 7.  The card art has grown on me a little, but the biggest reason for the bump is that it allows one to play with 12(!), improves the scorboard and improves the insert from Dixit.

I ended up keeping most of the cards from Odyssey because I want more variety, but I still think the new art is clearly a step down from the first two.

RATING: 7.5
I personally prefer the voting mechanic of the original game, whereby everyone places their voting tile face down. This version has you stick a pin in a voting board which can be really quite fiddly to hide from the other players. That said, the ability to play in much larger groups compensates.

Loses points for only providing one deck of cards (which you'll get through in a single game) then charging £16 for another!! I understand a great amount of work went into designing them, but what are the actual production costs?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.1
Dixit III with fixed board/pieces, a brand new deck of art and rules/stuff to play up to 12 players.

OK, now dixit's closer to a party game -  12p is tons better than 6p. Maybe it's me but the new cards seem a bit more hollow/less surreal than Dixit I. 

This game has helped me conclude that the dixit series is over for me. Even though I didn't overplay dixit, I lost interest gradually.

Would love to love this game (Dixit family) more. But I always fail to feel entertained or satisfied.

Often I don't have any card that suits the given clue and reasonably can trick other people.
I know it's part of the game - so it's rather my fault - but I also often end up thinking the given clues don't work with the teller's card.

Years ago we often played what I now know is known as Dictionary/Balderdash and I feel Dixit is far inferior to that. Words are worth a thousand pictures, I guess.

This is the only version of Dixit I have ever played, so I cannot compare it to other versions of the game. Unfortunately, I was not taken by the game. The concept sounds great, the art is phenomenal, but the 'everybody selects a card' part does not appeal to me at all. I mean, should your chances of convincing other players be so highly dependent on the cards you were given? This luck element makes me regard Dixit more as a pure social activity instead of a game. Would not mind "playing" it if brought to the table by someone else, but certainly would not suggest it.

Played the party version of this game and immediately decided that the original rules were significantly better. The party version eliminates one of the more exciting aspects of the game: choosing a card that best fits the theme and knowing that you are the one who chose to hand in those cards. 

Still, this game suffers from limited replayability just like the first version. As soon as many of the cards are cycled through, you are pretty much done when playing with the same group. Even with a different group, the knowledge of the different cards makes it less entertaining

Dixit is a party game for lots of folks, consisting only of cards with pretty illustrations on them. No math or reasoning, but lots of metaphor and intuitive skills needed: you choose a card from your hand, give a hint, and then everyone else also submits a card that best fits your hint. Then you display them all and folks try to guess which is your card from among all the 'decoys'. If your hint is too easy and everyone gets it, or too hard and nobody gets it, you get no points. If some get it, you get points, along with those who get it right. Great party game to play with non-gamers. If you like it. 

Dixit Odyssey is the version to get, as it's a re-release with a better board that allows for up to 12 players and has room in the box to add the other expansion cards, which you're going to want to get if you love this game. If you really love it, which many do, you're going to want to invest in all the expansion card packs. Dixit Odyssey plus all the expansions will be expensive, but well worth it if you love the game, and it has the bonus that non-game-playing friends often still love this game and will play it for hours.

I love Dixit as a game and I'm pleased to have Odyssey.  I haven't yet tried the team or 7+ player rules, but it's nice knowing they are there.  However, some of the charm and simplicity of the original is missing: the art is less striking, selection using pegboards instead of tokens is less satisfying and makes the scoring more complicated, the scoretrack is less attractive and lacks clearly-defined graduations, and (maybe its gloss surface?) the rabbits seemed easier to knock out of place.  And don't get me started on the pegs.

All Dixit versions are beautiful. The way you tell stories with car with just a single word or sentence is a genius idea. It was a revolution in the boardgame history. Since, we speak about the french game (like eurogames but with artwork).
However, all Dixit versions have the same problem : scoring. I find the scoring boring. It break the game rythm. And since Mysterium was released, it's worse cause this last one show how to score, win or loose keeping the game rythm.
So, play Dixit without point or use your Dixit cards to play Mysterium ;-)

Stand-alone expansion to "Dixit". Pros: sits up to 12, the scoring track is better than the original, there is room to fit all the game material from "Dixit", "Dixit 2" and "Dixit Odyssey" in the same box. Cons: the new variant rules are frankly baffling, there is a problem with the scoring pegs (they don't stay put too well) that has forced me to make some DIY replacements. Bottom line: same rating as the base game.

Get a 'regular' Dixit for the voting bits. 

But hey, more cards, right?

Dixit is always a hit, no matter your group.

We enjoy Dixit quite a bit and the voting boards are nice for this edition though I find it sometimes slows down the whole voting process. I think our family prefers the digital art expansions however so we moved this copy on and simply made our own score/voting board that fits nicely into the expansion box.

The "party game" interactivity of Apples to Apples with bizarre artwork and creativity instead of just making easy jokes. Attempting to get only a portion of the players (as opposed to all or none) to guess your card adds an extra layer of difficulty which prevent Dixit from getting stale.

Haven't tried the alternate rulesets yet. Hasn't been a need, though all of them look appealing.

The new art (mostly Coimbra, I believe) isn't as good as Caudet's original, as it's more one-dimensional and less bizarre.

I picked this up specifically to be a simple party game for large groups. It's not my favorite type of game, but I prefer this to others in its class (e.g. Apples to Apples, Cards Against Humanity). I expect play experiences depend a lot on the group, as most of my games have been with new players, my appreciation may grow with repeated plays.

Dixit is a great game with the potential for very broad appeal. It is great for parties or family gatherings and is very friendly for non-gamers, yet it also challenges the creativity, making it highly playable for seasoned gamers as well. The game is language independant and very simple to teach. It is amazing to me that such a simple game can work so well for so many different types of people.

I'm inclined to call Dixit Odyssey the crown jewel of the available versions, simply based upon the fact that it accomodates up to 12 players, which makes it the most party-friendly Dixit to date.

RATING: 7
I love having more players in the game and the new scoring system, while not completely elegant, is welcome over the voting chips. 

Also, my voting chips from the base game were starting to get worn down to the point you could barely read them.

As an expansion it doesn't do too much to cure the replayability shortcomings of the first edition. There are some more cards, a board to keep more player and an awfully unconfortable system of indicating the card and this means it is just a 7

Another game that didn't quite live up to the hype. This game is held in very high regard as a decent party game but I found it a little too repetitious to be enjoyable for more than a few games. There are simply not enough cards and I found the abstract illustrations uninspiring. I read somewhere about an out-of-print game called Faces that seemed to have a similar premise but with actual photos of people - that sounds like it could be more fun!

Get rid of apples to apples and get this game instead. The art strangely draws you in like an eldritch god and you must accept your fate by having most but not all people except their doom by choosing it as well to get points to win. Don't be fooled by the rabbit scoring tokens - it's beyond the mind's comprehension, we only mask that horror and see it as cute. 

That being said, this is a great gateway game to play with those who don't normally play games or don't like intense games.

This version plays 12 players!

This is not my kind of game. The only good thing about it is that it's very easy to learn and play. On the other hand I don't find it funny at all. If you think something very easy related to your card, everyone will find out what card it is. And if you think something  strange everyone will be angry asking you "what the hell were you thinking?!".

Great to have a version that is playable with more than 6 players, but with a big group rounds just take too long, and it is a hassle for everyone to look at every card. With 12, I rather play in two groups of 6. 
I prefer the art of the original version.

Fun game with a bigger group. The cards could be a little bit funnier and with more details you can use multiple times. After a few times you know the cards and you've used most of the card variations. Of course there are expansions, but in this regard i feel it could have been done better. Nice big group / party game. But, since it's a family type game, i think the theme is a bit too dark. I'd like to see more sets and variations with more happy, funny or different subject themed sets.

I think the pictures on the cards are less 'inspirational' than those of the original, but there are some awesome ones (my little sister loves the bunny astronaut). And they could've differentiate the colors green and light green a little more. I often bring this to birthdays.

Dixit is an enjoyable game, but I have a hard time calling it a party game, a light family game seems more fitting in my opinion.

It's a gorgeous game and as a fan you'll obviously want more cards, but luckily this stand alone expansion adds much more than cards. First of all it has a much better score board, bunny pawns that don't fall over, and a new voting system plus some variants for team play and large vs smaller groups.

If you already own Dixit and Dixit 2, you will love the variety that having so many different cards. However, for as good as the cards look, it's amazing how you still sometimes feel completely stumped as the storyteller looking at your hand of six cards. :)

I will not play Dixit with my gaming buddies, but my wife and daughters love it! That alone earns it a high rating from me. It's the kind of game that you can teach to anyone, and with Dixit Odyssey you can play it with up to 12, and it becomes more of an actual party game.

Dixit Odyssey is definitely the jumping on point for players new to Dixit - start with this one!

Bardzo ciekawe rozszerzenie bazowego Dixita, choć karty z pionkami do wciskania rozczarowują (pomysł świetny, wykonanie śliczne, ale pionki ze swoich miejsc po prostu wypadają...). Nowe karty w trochę innym stylu niż oryginalne (mniej abstrakcyjne - co może być zaletą lub wadą).

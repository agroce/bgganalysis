Great quick drafting game, akin to Sushi Go. Easy to learn with quite a bit more strategy than normal set collection games.

Very cute little game, much more fun than Sushi Go, with "take that" addition. Good with kids, and with adults. More tactical than it appears to be.

Cute but very light drafting game. I like it, but there's not too much more to it than a better than average take-that game.

Can't say enough about how much fun and deep this little box game is. The strategy feels so simple yet so many tough decisions to be had. Do you focus on building your own solar system or do you try to thwart what your opponents are trying to build? Love the added bonus goals with the supervisors for added scoring opportunities. This has become our go to game for short, interactive, strategy games before delving into a longer game. Can't say enough good things. Looking forward to expansions that are in the works as well! Keep up the great work!

This game is very light, but it's also very quick and pretty to look at. The aliens are really adoreably cute. The components yould be better, but that the whole game fits into such a small package is a great plus.

I gave it to my sister because she liked it so much.

RATING: 5
An okay game, but it's not as simple and streamlined as Sushi Go, and it lacks the depth of 7 Wonders, so I'm not sure exactly where this fits in any collection that has those other gateway drafting games.

RATING: 6.5
A fun drafting game. A bit on the simple side when it all is said and done, but I definitely prefer it to Sushi Go. I enjoy the idea that you draft first then play to yourself or others after all drafting is done. There's a bit of strategy involved. I still prefer Keep for drafting to this though.

When you put this in perspective as far as the depth and cost, this is a good game and good value. The more you play the more you feel like there is strategy involved. The whole game is the size of a deck of cards.

Fun for playing with my younger relatives to get them into tabletop games, as well as playing with my competitive-board-game-playing friends. Fast rounds and the excellently thought-out, concise mechanics make this a game my friends and I can play over and over without getting tired of it. Also great as a warm up game on game night.

1 play = 3 rounds. Didn't expect much but both of us were pleasantly surprised. We weren't sure how we felt about the card drafting but totally got into it once you have a basic strategy.

Fantastic filler game. It's a combination of Sushi Go with trying to complete sets with an extra competition of being able to mess with your opponents. I highly recommend the game.

Great little filler game, really quick to teach and easy to remember. Love the drafting aspect too. I would have preferred the game to have come in a lidded box rather than the standard pack of cards style opening as it's hard to open without wrecking the box. I'd love a deluxe edition where each player has a board with a sun in the middle and a spinner on and 8 spaces to place their solar system. Looking forward to playing this again, I think it'll get alot of use in our group of friends.

Decentish set collection card game with drafting and a bit of take that thrown in.  Almost exactly the same (but not quite as much fun) as Sushi Go, but with added ability to screw other players (although it's almost always the best way to lose - focusing on your own planet rather than spoiling others' is pretty reliably the best way to gain points).  

This isn't a super complex game and it is very popular with the kids.  Card and packaging quality at low end of spectrum but this was a cheapish Kickstarter so hard to complain.  Good one to have around on holiday to distract kids on a rainy day but not one you'd ever really want to play yourself given any degree of choice.

Just a few rules so it seems easy to win, but in fact it's hard to master...a cute card game, short, but with a surprising end if you don't use your brain cells all the time.

Excellent lightweight game on this subject.  Careful attention to the rules is needed, but one can begin play quickly.  Very enjoyable and playable in 1 hour or less.  I have the red and yellow Good Industries version, 2 copies, and the scenarios from the online version.

A nice basic wargame on hexes with basic counter pieces. Can be used to make your own battles, but 15 or so are included. Good to introduce a newcomer too. Can be made up into a figures based game on bigger hexes, or by using 2mm figs. Can be expanded to complicate it further. A good stalwart. Get it free online.

RATING: 7.8
PnP. Tried the Poitiers scenario which seems to have nothing to do with the historical battle. (Knights not unmounted, 2 French waves instead of 4... I'd like to tweak this into the direction of Men of Iron  without going overboard with the rules.)
-update- just mounted my second counter set. I have a feeling Ancients is pretty much all I need for wargaming (Ok, add Valor&Victory for WW2 squad level play and one or the other VPG for well tuned solitaire machines) - with fattened rules and customized scenarios for simulation's sake this still never gets overwhelming and remains playable.
-update- forget the fattening - the original unaltered rules is where it's at. Of course, much depends on the scenario to make it work.

I have the original version.  Great idea (let's have a quick filler game) and a good topic, but the rules could still stand to be improved I think, even in the latest edition.  Also tries to cover too much imho, i.e. too generic.  Might spontaneously destruct now that there's an Ancients version of Battle Cry.

Wonderful game.  Like GEV, simple to learn but hard to master.  There's much more depth to this game than meets the eye.  The only thing that bugs me is how games can turn on a leader going down due to pure luck, but there's plenty of historical precedent for such events.

The game system has the advantage of being simple and customisable, as can be seen from the scenarios which span from Megiddo to Sekigahara. Ample opportunities to design your own scenarios and special rules, which is great, for a free game. The simplicity can be a problem though, as it leads to blandness, but special rules can be incorporated through the scenarios.

RATING: 6.75
3W edition. 64 scenarii for 20 GBP (ebay) is good value for money. Core rules could be improved by house rules. Could benefit of better components.

EDIT - Revising up my Rating to 7, after switching from the paper version to the ported version in Vassal, which provides a much more pleasant gaming experience. The vassal module would benefit from having the turn and panic trackers added. This is my go-to game when I have 1 hour available. True, the system doesnt simulate properly some battles such as Cannae, but gives accurate results for the huge majority of battles.

EDIT - Revising up my Rating to 6.75. "A la charge" series provides a better experience as an introductory game, but doesn't have as many scenarios.

extremely simple and light wargame though good fun. the only bit I dont like is the rule where you move your commanders to wherever you want them. I dont understand why this rule is there or what it's supposed to simulate. That rule is just too abstract for my liking.

RATING: 10
Terrific game and one of my all-time favorites. Simple, but not simplistic, rules allow players to get into the game quickly. However, the dynamics of each scenario and intracasies of learning how to play different kinds of armies constantly create new opportunities for fun and stimulate the desire to learn more about the vast period covered. The simple nature of the rules allows the innovative gamer plenty of opportunity to add "home chrome" without changing the fundamental aspects of the game. Plus, there is a large community of Ancients afficianados who are constantly creating and posting new army lists, scenarios, and maps. Definitely a classic and a keeper.

RATING: 2
Just about to commence learning this game; intended for use as a diverting filler whilst opponents in more demanding games are taking their turn.

Irritating that after so many years, many editions, plenty of ink and virtual ink spilled, no one seems to have noticed the naval rules don't make sense, and prompted (or even proffered) a fix.  I've expended more mental energy trying to understand the oar rake and rudder attack rules than the game is worth.  Still, I think I'm there, at last, and will shortly produce my suggestion as to what the designer may have intended.

RATING: 8
Outstanding game system that, given the current trend towards simpler rules and shorter playing time, is one of the few wargames that has actually improved with age.  For 8 pages of rules, you get a land combat system, a naval combat system (which doesn't get discussed much, but it's just as good as the land system), and excellent design-your-own scenario support.  Not that you'll need to design your own scenario, as the game comes with 64.  Only downside on this game is the lack of detail, which may make the system seem too generic for some tastes.  In my mind that's a small sacrifice for a system that covers all of the pre-gunpowder era with simple, clever rules and about an hour per scenario.  Get the 3W "Black box" version, or download the game for free in DTP format from www.relativerange.com/ancients/index.htm

RATING: 7
Numerous scenarios with a simple I-go-you-go system.  Sufficient twists, which give very good feel to any ancient battles are made into the game for different characterization of different armies and tribes.  Combat system is gleaned and solid and it creates very exciting moment.  Mapboards are an abstraction of the real battlefields (sort of ASL-esque).  The big plus is that you can create thousands DIY scenarios as long as you have sufficient research materials, a pioneer model for the computer games.  This flexibility and feasibility of simulation credit this game an instant classic just like Advanced Squad Leader for WW2 stripped of complexity in the ancient world. A minus is the earthly design and simple production value of the counters and maps by an ameuter publisher.  The later 3W version is not much better than the original one in terms of production quality alone.  It is however an excellent game for the coffee break from GMT's Great Battles in History series.  Overall, it is a classic game, consistent and unified as a whole, especially for the ancient fan.

A clever, simple system that is really a game kit with great optional rules and a campaign system - all contained in 13 pages of rules (core rules are only 5 pages).  

I have the original first ed.  I also have King of Kings (Campaigns).  I would like to try a Hyborian age campaign game and LotR as well.  My only complaint is that the map needs to be enlarged to 11x17, easy enough to accomplish, which makes moving the pieces and facing much easier.  

Set up can be very quick, with some battles having around 10 counters per side.  Brilliant beer and pretzels fun with tons of scenarios.  Very nice intro game.

Rough comparison to other ancients games:

C&CA
rules: 28 Pages
scenarios: 15
Cost: $65.00

SPQR
rules: 32 Pages
scenarios: 14
Cost: $98.00

Armageddon 3000 to 500 B.C.

Scenarios: 14 official, 29 on consimworld
Cost: $20-$60

rules: 13 Pages (5 actual pages)

I own the 2nd edition, pictured.  Good Industries (GI) published both of the first two editions only difference between these first two editions was the box cover.  An excellent tactical game on Ancient combat.  System allows for any Ancient historical battle to be recreated.  A classic and very fun game to play, and enjoy.  Units are shown from an "above" crane shot view that allows for easy facing during engagements.

Like all the best games, this is simple to learn yet difficult to master. A few brief rules work well together to produce a wide range of tense situations with outcomes which are almost predictable - but not quite. Something this simple takes an awful lot of intelligent design. I use this game in combination with Bill Banks other much under-rated masterpiece, the campaign game, King of Kings. Well dome Bill!

I guess I own the free version.  It's on my computer.  How much of it do I need to print up before I "own" it anyway???  I say I own it.  I play this on Vassal.

This game is perhaps underrated and underplayed.  It's quick to play (6 turn scenarios), quick to learn (15 minutes at most) and thought-provoking.  Straightforward tactics.  The game provides a somewhat chess-like experience, which I think is as it should be, since chess is essentially the first wargame, created in a time before gunpowder.  Thus, those who wish to model ancient warfare should keep an eye on chess.

This game is severely lacking in chrome.  It's quite abstract.  It shares a few concepts with GBoH (like rout/panic levels) and models ancient warfare suitably well.  But this game is really about PLAYING, and as such it does remarkably well.  Quite fun.  It's a 9 because I always want to play it.  Quick and easy, but tactical enough that it's a good wargaming fix.

Battleplan,No.7 August-September 1988 features three scenarios :  "Pydna, 156 BC", Leuctra, 371 BC" and "Cannae, 216 BC".

This game can be used to resolve battles in the strategic game Imperator (3W) or King of Kings (GI).

This is surprisingly clever. It is one of a number of post-DBA board wargames that tried to implement the effects driven simulation DBA had done so well. Unlike some of the more chrome heavy games (like Command and Colours) this is very succesful in creating a really strong feel and tactical depth on the basis of a simple number of rules (the most important is the melee result, which really emphasises the difference between different classes of troops, particularly chariots and infantry).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good, light wargame.  I don't find the lack of maneuver that some folks do: just play scenarios that aren't phalanx-heavy.  

The rules work as a game, and they're straightforward and uncomplicated. Don't expect strict historical outcomes or strategies.  Take it as it is, and it's a fun game with room for interesting strategies within the scope of the rules.

This game has complete information available to both sides, so I've enjoyed it quite a bit in solo play as well.

I had a the black box edition. One of the few ancients games I ever owned. Great intro game and another survivor of the purge of 2004. Sometimes there are not a lot of tactical options other than to go straight in since the games are only six turns long and the forces start in close proximity to one another but all and all a lot of bang for the buck. I recently printed out the revised maps at 11"x 17", 2 feet x 3 feet and 3 feet by 4 feet. Then did a simple conversion to miniatures with AoM and Civ minis. A two figure stand is in Good Order and a one figure stand is disordered. A Civ standard bearer denotes a command point. It is starting to get some play again after a long period of retirement because of the minis. I checked into the cost of printing the new maps in color at 2x3. It's $4.00 a square foot or $24.00 per map.

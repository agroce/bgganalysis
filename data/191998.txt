GAME: Lost Legacy: Fourth Chronicle – The Werewolf & Undying Heart
RANK: 4402

My favorite micro-game series.

RATING: 7
I don't really pay much attention to the theme of the various sets, but this one at least partially 'ups' the Gothic horror ante of the setting, albeit in the most obvious way possible. The cards work smoothly together but I buy these to mix them up, and I think at this point there is probably enough Lost Legacy to last us all awhile. To me it's still the go-to customizeable preference over Love Letter, but some guests seem to dig more into one of the Love Letter versions' themes (Batman, Adventure Time, or the basic).

I liked it initially as a gamers version of Love Letter. But eventually I realized it was really not a very good game and that I would rather just play Love Letter if I have 4 players.

Played Werewolf once and Undying Heart once. I like the attempt to bring the theme of Werewolf into Lost Legacy.

a great new set, remains to be seen if either deck can unseat Vorpal Sword from the top spot though, need more plays

RATING: 4
Even for a filler, there are too few interesting choices, and too much chance. I'd rather play Coup.

Tried the Werewolf. Smart little semi-deduction game with decent amount of luck of draw. This time a bit more aggressive variant. Victory point system is a bit boring and the game might be a bit too long for what it offers. It's still nice and offers some tension, though.

Another solid set in the Lost Legacy line. I think the Undying Heart is a bit more thematic than The Werewolf, but both are pretty solid micro-games with a strong sense of player elimination. If you like that in these sorts of games like I do, you'll be happy with these.

I think I shall probably call it a day with this set. The game has been pretty much mined dry.

Like all Lost Legacy sets, these are "more of the same" but still different in feel. The Werewolf I think may go on to become one of my favourite sets - there are lots of opportunities for deduction here. As for "Undying Heart" (aka the Vampire set), that is a pretty vicious game where player elimination, present as a possibility in all LL sets, is ever-present and always something you have to think about. For this reason it's perhaps a bit more random than other sets, but it's still a lot of fun - and the card interactions are designed in such a way that there are risks no matter what you draw.

I feel like they're finally starting to run out of Lost Legacy ideas. One of the sets included here has a "choose a player to skip their next turn" card. I always see "skip a turn" cards as a red flag because in general they don't belong in modern board games. The Lost Legacy card in that set has the text "this card can't be played." You would think they would have some creative ability for the title card, but instead they went with the most basic, nothing ability harkening all the way back to the Princess in Love Letter.

With all of that said, it still feels like Lost Legacy. Considering the speed and simplicity of the game, the "skip a turn" cards actually aren't too bad. If you like Lost Legacy, here's more Lost Legacy.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
Like the other Lost Legacy games (and Love Letter), the game just doesn't work with two. It's best with four for a more dramatic investigation phase, but should be fine with three as well.

Fine, I guess? It's LL so it's always solid, but the Undying Heart set is pretty dull, and only a few new things in The Werewolf shake up the formula.

Werewolf is great, Undying Heart seems kind of meh.

RATING: 7
The Werewolf set really needs to be played with the extra scoring rounds to benefit from the Werewolf ability. There are some slight timing issues due to abilities. Undying Heart is another cutthroat elimination deck.

RATING: 10
I've only played John Goodenough's The Werewolf deck, and loved it. I think that the Lost Legacy system is amazing. I look forward to trying the Undying Heart as well. I wish these two decks were available in the bilingual Japanese/English edition, with the original art.

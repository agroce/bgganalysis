Dice chucking arena combat from GW. Just grab a beer and smash some skulls. What's not to like?

RATING: 8
Ridiculously fun!! Game length is just right.  Plenty of tough choices to make in the cardplay.  Even allows eliminated players to have certain actions, and occasionally temporarily brings one back to life.  Only thing going against it is the cost of the extra minis statted out in the back of the book.

Boisterous fun old school GW with tons of drama. The card based activation system is very entertaining and presents engaging yet quick decisions that have an actual impact on the results. 

The amount of maneuvering and depth of the mechanisms is perfect for this type of game and it does everything you want it to.

An extremely competent small-scale enclosed boardgame, that provides a fun slice gladiatorial combat. Plenty of variety in the characters, with the included models a welcome addition to my Age of Sigmar starter set (each designed to a high standard, as per GW's modus operandi), and custom sketch artwotk in the books providing a really nice unique style to the game. The mechanics are fast and frantic, providing a good range of options but ramping up tactical decisions, and the use of a hex-grid to determine unique attack swathes for each individual model is a touch of genius. IF I had to name a shortcoming... I might have perhaps liked a little more use of an active arena area - with a variety of potential traps, perils, and pitfalls - but this is a very minor quibble (with the focus on strategically piling in on the weakest links) or the involvement of minor warriors/spectators on the edges, who could be slaughtered for small bonuses at a risk of leaving one exposed... but again, something that could be easily houseruled in later! The fact the board is double-sided was also a nice surprise, and provides a little additional variety. An incredibly strong experience - long may such releases continue!

Some cool ideas but the movement system is awful, the game also drags on too long. Lovely miniatures though.

What I like from my games is a strong sense of editing. The ability for a design to practice restraint adding in enough to make me feel like I am playing what is represented on the table and gives me the opportunity to make some decisions. But at the same time not bog down in abstraction and moving parts which obscures the theme. That is Gorechosen, you play as a warrior looking to kill the others by rolling dice. If that sounds appealing then get the game.

Becomes repetitive quickly. I bought it as a filler game but it takes longer than expected each time we play. At least I got to paint nice miniatures.

A really fun filler, depending on the group. Not sure if I've ever seen a filler game by GW before.

The September White Dwarf issue has additional rules about using Valkia and Skarr as bosses. The game is decently priced and offers fairly unique arena fight - which is  abit out of fashion lately. 

I have not played and I will change my rating, I left it to counter the automatic "I hate GW ratings".

When I first heard about this, I thought this game would be just another cash grab with minimal figs by a company known for subpar contemporary boardgame attempts. Cynical would have been an understatement. 

But it turned out to be good. Shockingly good. 
So good in fact, that I believe only Space Hulk rivals it as GW's best in house design.
The card activation is a stroke of genius in how it is implemented, as is how the initiative it meshes so well in this game. It is am easy game to grasp and play, and the whole package could be described as a distillation of fun. A succinct design without a ton of superfluous crap clogging its arteries.
GW should be quite proud of being a patron of this design, as I believe it to be the best thematic game produced in 2016.

The only criticism I can level at it is that I wish there were more variety in obstacles and their effects given in the arena. Instant death pit is functional, but I think a variable effect would add some uncertainty and suspense.

Nice and quick game of fighters on the bloody sands of Khorne coliseums!
Anyway, they are just 4 miniatures... expensive. They can be used in the main game (Age of Sigmar) but if you are searching for a board game, this will be quickly left apart.

By the way, I liked it. Si quieres ver la review en castellano: http://profanus40k.blogspot.com.es/2016/10/era-de-sigmar-probamos-el-gorechosen.html

There are four beautiful miniatures so it doesn't take long before one can actually play (as I only play with painted models - part of the fun!). Rules are quick to learn and the game itself is quite rapid. Really enjoying it! The White Dwarf supplement (additional "bossess" and new way of playing) ensures even more (prolonged) fun. A larger (than two...) variety of boards would be appreciated though.

The game relies on a mix of 3 mechanics: 1) move and place your model 2) manage your rage to improve your initiative 3) spend carefully your action cards. Be able to combine the 3 is the key to win and is highly rewarding. A lot of fun and fast!

(1 play)  The best gladiatorial arena combat game I have played.  If you want strategy and skill to be the primary factors to determine the winner, this is not the game for you.  In our first game, one fighter was beheaded in the first round.  A couple of rounds later, I was able to push the two others into each other.  With limited options, they had to fight it out to the death.  I mopped up the remains.  Each fighter has unique skills and combat style to play, but really, this game is about dice and death.

Really curious about this. One of the firs board games on the WH franchise done by GW itself after the split form FFG, 
Used to FFG thorough play testing, quality and in general strong BG experience i'm not sure if GW will keep the same level.
Past GW produced board game have been deluding by quality and completeness of the rule set.
Really looking forward even if draft judging from the first images at https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Gorechosen-ENG cards quality doesn't look as good as FFG used to be. For sure miniature that were not allowed in FFG franchise will add points on the products but will it be enough ? let see

Nice little game as a standalone and also nice that the models can be used for Age Of Sigmar and the game can be expanded with 4 of the characters from Age Of Sigmar including 2 from the starter set. Good value if you are an AoS Khorne player as the models retail for ~£18 each so getting 4 plus a tabletop game is good when compared to other GW offerings.

My wife said to give this a 7.5 but she's wrong.  This game is amazing.  It's as old-school as it gets.  You chuck dice, press your luck, and bash your opponents senseless.  Plus it has sweet miniatures.  There's nothing here to not like.

This is the epitome of a beer & pretzels game.  Lots of mindless fun.

Relies a whole lot on chance, but that's precisely what makes this game so hilariously dramatic. The result is a fast, hard-hitting, and silly game. That's a good thing.

Great action card mechanic that combines very well with the initiative/wrath meter. Surprisingly well designed, as Games Workshop has been in the season of simplifying rule sets, this is an elegant introduction to its Age of Sigmar world and color (though I personally think very little of AoS lore)

Warhammer gladiators team vs team or pvp miniatures skirmish. Assembly,  glue and paint required.  Interesting interplay between the initiative deck and the wrath gauge on your next round number of actions.

Solo play - ridiculous, funny and great fun. 

Painting up the minis before playing it with friends.  Quite excited to shred through a bunch of plays with this one.

When it comes to word games, Scrabble is probably at the top of my list--if for no other reason than its ability to use board position to maximize the value of poorly drawn tiles.

Super Scrabble has a larger board with new quad-value board spaces.

Unfortunately, double the letters sometimes only means it is easier to end up with a hand of AAAEEIO.

Surprisingly, 6 years ago a friend of mine and I invented a game we called "MetaScrabble", where we made a larger board quadruple scores and added 40% more tiles (including a hyphen!) that I selected based on careful histogram calculations of need.  So I was shocked to see almost that exact game now for sale.  I wonder who "came up" with the idea for this one....

More tiles, more board, more bonus squares, just plain more Scrabble.  It has a tendancy to lead to longer games, but also to bigger scores and occasionally ridiculous plays.  A fun variation for fans of Scrabble.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice variation on the original.  Lots more room and more scoring spaces make for lots more big scoring opportunities and room enough for 7 letter words.  Playing time is longer and your memorization of all the two letter words will not be as useful.

RATING: 8
I've seen the complaints about this game, but as a couple of serious but not hard-core Scrabble players, we quite enjoyed it. For us, the endgame of Scrabble can sometimes stall, as decent hooks become unavailable and play becomes badly constrained, but Super Scrabble has a bit more breathing room and the endgame seems not to be so blunted. Also, I can see Super Scrabble being viable with 4, while basic Scrabble really is not.

It is long (comfortably over 2 hours), so watch out for that. But the length didn't bother me too much - we just took a break halfway through - and I like the scoring options on the expanded board. Overall, a win, although certainly the larger scale lacks the more compact elegance which has made Scrabble a classic. Scrabble purists probably won't care for this.

And if you didn't like Scrabble in the first place, nothing will change here.

 Our house rules for 2 players : Draw 10 tiles . Use 7 tiles 50 point bonus . Use 8 tiles 60 point bonus . Use 9 tiles 70 point bonus . Use all 10 tiles 100 point bonus . It just seems like you end up with 3 or 4 of one letter when you only draw 7 tiles . The game doesn't go any faster , but the point totals pretty much triple or quadruple in our games .

RATING: 9
Best Scrabble version yet.  But remember that if your word lands on two kinds of word bonus squares, you multiply the word bonuses (say, triple word times quadruple word, which would mean 12 times the score of the word).  Recommendation, get the deluxe version, because that way the letters can't slide around at inopportune moments.  Also recommended:  Use the 14 letter house rule I learned from my female best friend's daughter.  14 letters to choose from each turn is alot more fun than 7 letters per turn are.  -Additional thought:  The SuperScrabble Deluxe gameboard isn't as nice as the Scrabble Deluxe gameboard is (the former is made of plastic, while the latter is made of wood).

The number of tiles was doubled and the board expanded by 3 boxes in all directions. A really nice touch was shading the new areas so that either game is playable on the board.  

It's just a great 4-player game. It's much more open than the original and extra high scoring games are common. It's also much longer but for my group at least the game was so enjoyable that no one mined the length. 

A great family game.

Very well designed. In many ways it's an improvement on regular Scrabble.  The letter values were left unchanged, but the letter distribution was significantly altered ... and for the better.  The letter distribution, the board design, and the point inflation relative to the unchanged 50 points for a bingo, have made a game in which open play is rewarded more than it is in regular Scrabble.  As a result, you aren't as likely to get the blocked up, stairstep designs that are common when good players meet in plain Scrabble.  I think most players enjoy an open game more. I play whatever style works. In plain Scrabble, a closed style is often effective; in Super Scrabble, not so much.

Scrabble on steroids.  This game is nice because it adds in extra rare letters and keeps open the possibility of playing more words for big points.  The 4x word and letter squares also make for exciting plays.  The bigger board though makes for longer games which can be a negative.  It also makes going back to the original game feel very restrictive.

Don't know why there isn't a separate listing for Super Scrabble Deluxe, just as there is a separate listing for Scrabble Deluxe.  Anyway, the only Super Scrabble on my wishlist is Super Scrabble Deluxe, because I can't stand scrabble boards that let the tiles slide around. Even for Super Scrabble Deluxe, it's low on my wishlist given how expensive it is.

UPDATE: There's a somewhat less expensive version now, where the board has pegs for holders.  I'd like that. Still don't want a plain flat board.

I like the bigger board.  The only problem I have is that the wood letters do not match the size of the boxes on the board, so you are constantly moving them back and forth to make sure what box they are in if you are trying to make a new letter.  The wood letter squares are all different sizes. I know it's a minor problem but I still noticed it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Bought new.  I don't know what I was thinking.  It seems like a cool idea, but whoever was put in charge of creating the board wasn't thinking very clearly.  Far too many opportunities for double-doubles, making for an effective surfeit of quad word scores.  Messes up the balance for two players.  Maybe it's okay for three or four where the balance is already messed up anyway.

Edit: Have now played with three players.  Much more playable that way.

This game pretty much plays exactly the same as Scrabble.  While I imagine the game takes somewhat longer because of extra tiles/space, it really doesn't feel that way.  Bigger bonus spaces make grabbing them even more important, but they were pretty important in the original anyway.  This is a great game if you really like Scrabble and want a little more.  If you're not a Scrabble fan, then this is obviously a pass.

Twice as many letter tiles means the games last twice as long.  Maybe there's some rule that helps that, but I've only played on a friend's board, and he just plays by standard rules (no more tiles in the bag, someone uses last tile from stand).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is conventional Scrabble but with a 21x21 grid instead of the usual 15x15 grid. The extra size allows for quadruple letter and word spaces. Play also uses 200 tiles rather than 100. Interestingly, the frequency is not merely the 100-set doubled: there are, for example, more than twice  the number of S tiles and fewer than double the number of Ls.

I didn't mind it's length but my wife as a scrabble lover didn't like the added length.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A stunning example in how to take a fantastic classic game and ruin it.  Super Scrabble attempts to "improve" Scrabble by, basically, inflating scores (by adding quadruple-scoring opportunities) and making it bigger (bigger board and DOUBLE the number of letter tiles).  The latter is particularly an awful idea; this makes what was a good game into an exercise in tedium, as Super Scrabble lasts FOREVER.  The original could tend to go long due to AP problems; doubling its length, effectively, destroys the enjoyability of the game.  The only purpose I can see in Super Scrabble is for bragging rights about that time you scored 800 points, but you'd be better off just doubling your score from a regular Scrabble game and pretending that was your score; you'll save a lot of time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've become a big Scrabble fan lately, so I figured Super Scrabble would be a MUST HAVE for me. Fortunately, my regular opponent bought it before I did. While it certainly doesn't wreck the game, it doesn't add enough to deserve a spot on my want list.

Aside from being able to get higher scores and taking twice as long to play, Super Scrabble isn't *that* much different than regular Scrabble. Of course, if you're a very competitive player, you'll spend more time making your move to take advantage of the added scoring opportunities. So that adds even more time to the game.

All in all, less enjoyable than the original, but only slightly. I probably wouldn't turn down a game of Super Scrabble, but I'll always prefer the original.

This game is just too damn long for 2 players.  But I think it would be good with 4, where regular Scrabble is just too damn short.

It just doesn't seem right that there are more "C"s and "M"s than "G"s (6 to 5), more "H"s than "B"s or "P"s (5 to 4), and more "D"s than "L"s (8 to 7) despite the fact that the letter *values* haven't changed.  I have no problem with tweaking the letter distribution, and with the exception of the deceptively annoying C, most of the changes look to be for the better- the relatively fewer "I"s and "V"s are *very* welcome; and "S"s are artificially scarce in the base game.  But, if they tweaked it as much as they did, they should have considered changing the values, as well.

Scrabble with a bigger board, alternate letter tile mix and more scoring opportunities. I'm not sure that bigger is necessarily better with this one, as the game seems to take forever. Also, the board is pretty shoddily designed, especially considering that this is supposed to be a "deluxe" version. I didn't pay a lot for my copy, so it doesn't bother me too much. That being said, if I was a huge Scrabble fan and I dropped fifty bucks on this, I'd probably be pretty disappointed...

About as enjoyable as the original, though I suspect this works better with more people instead of just 2 (which I normally have for original) it takes quite a long time to get through the game.

Takes much longer than normal Scrabble. There are so many bonus squares that working out your best play is more difficult, increasing downtime for the other players. Higher tile variance can lead to more annoyed players. This is Big Scrabble, it's not super.

Like playing Scrabble, but I prefer the app. I literally only purchased this for the tiles!

I liked this game until I realized the strategy of choice was "memorize a bunch of two-letter quasiwords."

OK, look, I enjoy Scrabble. I've read Word Freak, loved it, but this version is just too big! Quadruple Word Score! Madness!!!

It feels like a bigger, longer version of Scrabble - which is to say that they kept its balance about the same.  If you've got extra time, and enjoy the word-crossing momentum, play this one.  If you have less time, play the original instead.

Too long... play two games of regular Scrabble instead of one long game of Super Scrabble.

After 1 Play: The bigger board adds lots of time to the game without really adding anything else.  Just play classic Scrabble.

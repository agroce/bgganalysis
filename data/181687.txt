RATING: 7
Really like the art/big cards and the different theme. Actual gameplay mechanics are just so-so. Also perhaps slightly broken in that the game is pretty much entirely determined by who can complete one of the bonus health projects pretty early. After a few games I don't believe I have ever seen anyone who didn't complete one of these out score someone who did.

1st play: Mechanically I'm not so sure how interesting this game is, but it's a lot of fun to play thematically.  You have to balance life projects with fun events, jobs and wives.  Actions are in short supply when you get older and all the of the different choices feel like they contribute to the overall outcome.  I enjoyed my play and the narrative my actions created.

2nd play: The game is fine but very samey and the choices are pretty bland when you strip away the art.  Get 3 of one resource, or 3 of another resource, or 3 of yet another resource.  A lot of games can be boiled down like that, but in this case, the game is all theme.  Cute, but not sustaining.

Only have one play through at 2 players under our belt, but we really enjoyed playing it.  The game appears to have several paths to victory as my wife I and I had completely different approaches.  I had a level 2 job (level 3 never appeared or I probably would have jumped all over it) and a relationship eating up my actions each turn.  She had no job and was all over the board doing things.  Had she remembered to complete her yoga training she would have won without contest as it would have awarded her an entire extra round over me, but we ended up coming down to the tie breaker in favor of me with a job.  I was able to buy more items and participate in more activities with my steady cash flow!  

It was fun, lots of fun narrating our stories as we played.  My only concerns is when is that going to run out?  We do have the KS promos and the expansion to add in still, so hopefully that will keep the stories fresh and entertaining when needed.  Was a good, light-weight game to us and we look forward to bringing it to the table again.  Will adjust rating after more plays.

RATING: 6.5
Not very interesting mechanics (accumulating and converting various resources) attached to a colourful and amusing theme. Very enjoyable if you're willing to approach with a casual, role-playing, enjoy-the-ride mindset. If you're in it for the game play alone, you may be disappointed.

My favorite "life" type game a real blast and it's probably the one game that I immediately understood how to play well.  I just like the idea of games where you go through life until death it can create a great or even funny story line.

RATING: 8
This is an adult version of the game of life.  I don't say adult because of the theme.  It is very family friendly.  It is a worker placement game that feels right.  Would I say it is the best worker placement game?  Nope.  It is different enough from the others to warrant a spot in your collection though.

RATING: 8
Effectively the sort of worker placer I normally hate - do this action to move up on this scale or to gather this or that resource. What makes this work is that there's two key factors that make all the difference: the first is conveyance - the thematic relationship between your actions and their effects are logical and thematic. Second of all, the stress and health mechanisms add a delicious extra layer of resource management that makes for interesting timing and sequencing decisions. It's a cool game and I can see it's something I'll want to explore to much more depth.

RATING: 8
I hate this game... Only because I can manage to live a fuller life in 2 hours than I've managed to do in real life so far. 

I love this game for the fact that it has such a novel theme that makes it so easy to tell stories. In my very first game I dated a guy who only wanted me for my things, he required of me to keep buying more stuff, whilst he provided almost nothing to the relationship. DAMN YOU SEAN, YOU SELF CENTRED PIECE OF POO! Because I was a weak man and couldn't resist his charm we eventually got married. Sean died soon thereafter. 

The above story came about because I made some suboptimal decisions and that was okay. The game to me is a lot more fun when trying to create a story than it is when trying to min/maxing. By a long shot.

Only question is replayability=mystery for a few plays more, the vast amount of cards for each deck do give the sensation that this wont be a problem for the foreseeable future. Other than that, quite interesting theme and with meaningful choices to make throughout the game. Solid in my opinion.

Update: another thing i love about the game is that it tells a story. In the end you might not win, but you will have a cool life laid in from on you. How much more appropriate is that from a 'game of life'?

(2-6 players, 20 min/player) How will the story of your life be written? This game takes you from teenage drama all the way to your dying day (whenever that might be), asking you to figure out which activities will make your life meaningful. Do you engage in lots of hobbies? Pursue a lucrative career and retire with a pension? Own the largest toy collection in the world? Fall in love with one (or more!) people? All these options are at your command in this card-drafting management experience.

A fine worker placement game, though it lacks any real tension.. Rarely can I imagine a need to take overtime. Even if you get knocked out in old age before your opponents, they can't do too much damage to you which is good and prevents dramatic runaway leader.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
The best "life" game too date... although that wasn't a tough title to take.  Overall a pretty simple worker placement game, but surprisingly AP inducing, which did cause the game to run a bit long.  It can be a bit tough to fight off stress, while at the same time building an engine to score points.  This might be better with less than 4 players, but one I definitely want to play more of.  Not sure if this one is a long term keeper, but it looks promising so far since it is pretty different, although it was a bit fiddly.

Kickstarted w/expansion and promos. I've read all the reservons about the game (lack of hearts, ambiguous rules, fiddly, too light for what it is), but nonetheless am drawn in by the theme.  I'm gambling that the expansion helps alleviate most of these. 

Edit: played and enjoyed it.  Some rules needed to be looked up, we played some rules incorrectly, but the end scoring was close

Jonathan introduced this one with "I hope this isn't a good game so I can sell it", which left a lot of upside for pleasant surprise. It was certainly better than it first looked, and turned out to be a fairly enjoyable game. Still, it felt much like a tactical point salad game where long term considerations are vague at best (Same reason I don't love five tribes). It was a humorous game though at times because of what it says about relationships and the pursuit of happiness.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The theme is what largely carries this game for me, in that your "character" really develops a life story, pursuing careers and hobbies, having relationships, etc. This is what I wanted CV to be, but thankfully the mechanics of this game are far more appealing. 

I particularly enjoy the challenge of balancing "fun," high-scoring but stressful things with your health: earning points in-game is great, but if you can spend some effort extending your life, you might get an entire extra round to yourself at the game end. I also really appreciate that this game (unlike most others of this type) allows for gay and lesbian relationships (and even polyamorous ones) as easily as heteronormative ones.

RATING: 7
Rated 7 after one play. The Pursuit of Happiness is a fairly standard worker placement game with a wonderful theme. Pretty much every game mechanism has been seen elsewhere, but the marriage of them and mechanics is very strong, creating some smirks at the thematic mashups of breaking up with a spouse to take a better job, or working overtime to afford a fancy hobby, etc. In my game, I ended up taking the job as a journalist while dating someone who really wanted me to buy lots of items and going clubbing at night to establish stronger relationships. Overall the game plays smooths and is very easy to grok for anyone who plays games with regularity.

There's only one thing that bugs me about the game. The jobs, the activities... they are all randomly dealt from a deck, and there's no scaling up or timing of cards as the game progresses. This seems more acutely an issue for the jobs. Is "CEO" (and the matching prohibitive costs) really an option in Round 2? One benefit of completing jobs is getting promoted to the next tier, but if those cards aren't timed to the game arc, it feels a bit off.

That's a small complaint, though, and I'd be happy to play this again.

Difficult game to rate. Fun to play and theme is great. But, 1 play felt like a single path to victory... don't get a job. The winner of our game got a job second to last turn and regretted it, but still won by a good margin.

This game would be better with any other theme, because I really don't feel like I'm living a life when playing. Don't get me wrong, I love pushing resources, but getting into a relationship should be more than just spending creativity (?) and getting a promotion should be more than studying hard for months only to forget everything after winning a quiz show.

First thoughts of this game was that it was a lot to take in at first and a ton of different options that you could take but it ended up being really fun. We ended up figuring out the flow of the game and what our strategies might be. Our scores ended up being fairly close as well and we both had pretty different strategies so it was a balanced game in my opinion. 

Right now I rated it at a 7 but that could change in the future. I love the components of the game and the way the art on the board looks. I don't mind the art on the cards either but they're not my favorite. I liked the weight of this game. It allowed me to think ahead and figure out what my plan was where some other people had a hard time figuring out what they wanted. Overall, I enjoyed it but I will need more plays in order to fully decide what I think.

And then I woke up one day and said no I will not pay $49 for a good theme with probably not enough or possibly home grown gameplay. 2.3 weight? That right there sunk it for me for now. Maybe I'd pay $20 to gamble but I need more than a good theme.

I want more and harder decisions and a game that will happily burn its players. I want it heavier. I don't "play" themes as much as heavy enough games with themes.

I like themes. I can't buy on just a theme though. I'll buy it in post sometime down the line possibly.

Players: 1-4 players (best with 3-4)
Play time: 60-90 minutes
Mechanic: Worker placement
Theme/setting: The Game of Life, the gamer's board game

Rating based on 3 solo games, 2 2-player games and one game with 4 players.

Purchased this game through Kickstarter, based on theme and runthrough (Rahdo). Was not quite sure how I'd like it and whether it would be played with my family and/or gaming group. 

The group liked it quite a bit, and so do I. I really like the theme, just I do with the Game of Life, but here you really are in control of what you do and this could be considered the gamer's version of Game of Life.

What I really like is how the game flows. You start in your teenage years with a part time job that will generate you some money to spend and later on you get a "real" job, find a partner, settle down (if you want, everything is optional), but also have the opportunity to take on projects, do activities and buy items. On several occasion you will see things you remember from when we were young and follow that path, or just go a completely different route which you didn't take at the time.

Not a difficult game and rules are fairly straightforward, but there's enough depth in there to make tactial/strategic decisions that will earn you the most Long Term Happiness (victory points), and that's in the end what it is all about!

The core of the game goes through a nice worker placement, although there is no real innovation here.
However, the game has its theme very well concieved and it`s very fun to play. It´s a very good balance between a party game and a Euro.
After the game has been played, it really makes you think twice about the heading of your own real life, especially if you play it when you already have a respectable age!...

Started out as fun, but midway through it got repetitive, and we mainly focused on the dry mechanics of the game.
It was way too long for what it was as well and the game dragged on.
The great number of different options also mean that the AP prone crowd will suffer (and make their friends suffer as well)

Another thing is that the game is very solitaire, aside from drafting a card someone else wanted (almost never happened) and the downtime you never feel the presence of the other players as the table.

The next in the line of Game of Life, Funny Friends, CV, life experience games.  This one does it via worker placement, and it's okay, if a little long and predictable.  Lots of fiddly resources to acquire and spend.   Not bad, but doesn't stand out.  It would have been great if it had some player interaction, similar to Funny Friends, where the players were interacting through their character / life experiences.  Hard to design and pull off though, much easier to phone in another worker placement game.

Pursuit sits somewhere on the fence between 6 and 7 for me.  It's interesting to note that we played this after playing the Voyages of Marco Polo, which had a similar feeling of "holy crap, there's no way I can accomplish what I want to."  Despite trailing for most of the game, I was able to close the gap and overtake last place simply because I lived one turn longer than everyone else, but otherwise, this game is insanely tight and we found that improving your health was insanely rare.  Like, $1500 MtG card rare.

Anyways, Pursuit is an interesting twist on the worker-placement genre and unique enough to not feel like a worker-placement game, at least on the surface . The idea is your workers are measures of your time and how you spend your time dictates what you can do.  The resource management swings between wild extremes - in all cases, each player had an abundance of one particular resource, but hardly any in another category.  Finding ways of closing that deficiency proved to be difficult, but not impossible.  Other than that, in spite of the theme, you're going to find a lot of familiar territory here with spaces providing either points or resources or sometimes both.

The twist, then, is that the spaces available have variable results.  On the board, there are 9 key spaces that allow you to gather resources or pick up some cards, which could be projects, jobs/careers, items and pets, or lovers/partners.  Each of these cards you pick up are in turn their own spaces that can be improved or "levelled up" to provide more benefits at the cost of increasing upkeep.  This is pretty neat as it ties quite well into the theme - projects are tiered so that over time you will become better at something, jobs offer constant payment at the cost of some of your resources like influence or creativity, and partners inevitably require more of your precious time (your workers).  It's very well thought-out and the cartoony art is very well done.

I guess where I feel a little off is that the game feels a little off.  Not by anything that would break the game, but something felt like it was missing (it could have also been my splitting headache at the time, so that might have contributed to the feeling).  Where the easiest comparison is the Sims, Pursuit is missing that feeling of possibility.  By that I mean when you sit down and play the Sims, the world feels like your oyster - you can do anything and everything and experiment.  Pursuit, in contrast, is too tight to ever be experimenting - you gotta have a plan and you gotta execute it without deviation.  Dipping your toe into other waters will cost you precious time and ultimately points.  That's not a hit against the game, mind you, as it keeps the tension high and the brain burn hot, but maybe it's the art direction that led me to believe that Pursuit had something else in store for us.

This is a good game, but I'm just not sure where it sits with me personally.  Take that as you will.

I really got into the theme of it and decided before the game even started that I wasn't going to bother getting a job or a relationship. I ended up getting into a relationship and it was a bad decision. A fun game, a bit similar to CV, but better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At the conclusion of the game you walk away with a neat story: got a certain job, explored various hobbies, bought some cool stuff, had a relationship. While playing this game I said >5X "thematically that makes sense," esp. in relation to stress, when you have too much going on in the game you accumulate stress which means that future endeavors are more costly to you. The game moves along at a quick pace, most likely because very little strategy needs to be employed. A good way to approach The Pursuit of Happiness would be as a lighter game that generates an amusing story for its players.

Decent worker placement game, the art is gorgeous, but the life aspect just didn't really click with me as either Karnaxis or CV did.

Across the board, my group preferred Karnaxis over Pursuit of Happiness. The reason being that actions you take in Karnaxis (or even CV) really does affect your future actions. Say you went to school, you actually got "smarter" and would be able to use your smarts permanently for the rest of the game. In pursuit of happiness, it's simply an action to get more tokens, which you'll then spend and it's gone - at the end of the game, I don't really feel like there was much self-improvement or that I've "lived" that part of my life.

Furthermore, most of the projects/items/etc. that you buy don't really do much or seem that thematic and that's a shame.

It's a fun game overall though, will play it when the group prefers something a little lighter than Karnaxis, but don't want to roll so many dice ala CV.

I don't want to seem racist, but the Greeks can not seem to make a decent rulebook. A lot of ambiguity. Read a couple of rulebooks from different Greek designers, and every one of them has been a struggle to read.

The game itself is decent, if not that engaging and with some fiddliness. I find CV to be funnier, faster and to be more streamlined.

Mediocre worker placement game under the hood. Engaging design and fun involved theme sprinkled over. While you are mostly just playing to watch the card's story unfold, there are decisions to be made towards trying to win the game.

One gripe I had is many of the cards reflect geek life. A wider range of items and hobbies beyond; video games, comic books, board games, etc. would of created a more interesting experience.

It's fun, it's a little simple and the threat of stress seems less like an obstacle to gaining points (like Feld might do) and more like a way to keep players from taking risks. In turn, each game seems too safe and similar as trying anything too different creates stress but does not offset that stress with a decent enough reward.

This game is great; much better than it looks.

Well, what else can I say, other than to make obvious comparisons?

The Pursuit of Happiness is the game Funny Friends wished it was; while the two games have a very similar theme and approach, this one manages to achieve the feeling of... life! For some reason, Funny Friends seemed a touch dry in comparison and left my collection long ago.

The graphics are not my favourite style, but suit the mood of the game; it's clean and flows well; but with each progressive turn players are forced to think a little harder about how to make the best use of the time they have in their short lives.

I can highly recommend it!

This game gets +2 stars for how well it implements its theme. Mechanically I think the game will get stale after a couple of plays (in essence you're doing the same thing, collecting cards that give you resources to collect more cards, rinse, repeat, die) but the variety of "lives" and stories that come out of it make the whole experience well worth the effort.

Basically this is a pretty straight forward worker placement game. Pretty multiplayer solitair since you have little to none possibilities to thwart each other.

Strenght of the game is the circle of live which unfolds before your eyes. With the right crowd you'll have a blast.

Unfortunately this just isn't enough to make me want to play it again and again.

Having only 2 plays under my belt, I dont have to judge this too quickly. I personally had fun playing my character, being thematic with choices they would make. It was a good time. However, some of the rules were fuzzy on the stress level. It felt very easy to get beat up on, so much so that it kind of lost its fun. Id love to give this a few more whacks before i get too judgemental. I feel like that is the type of rule that could be easily be house ruled...to be continued!

Box extrmely thin.  This combined with Terraforming Mars' box issues is making Stronghold known for "Crappy" inserts and boxes.  I would rather pay more for better boxes and/or inserts.

Rules for specific things didn't pan out as intuitively as they first seemed initially.  Maybe that was because this was our first play.  Gratification for life achievements was good but the engine building aspect of the job/partner cards seems underdeveloped.  What a wonderful idea to have a full on real game of life.  I am going to keep giving this one a try and I hope to edit this in the positive direction because I really, REALLY want to like this game!

I was looking for a more sophisticated version of LIFE and stumbled upon this game. A very good game, but it omits some key aspects of life. You don't choose whether to go to college. You don't need to choose a mode of transportation (that is, you don't decide whether to purchase a vehicle). You don't choose a place to live. You don't decide whether to purchase insurance. These are major omissions, but there are still a lot decisions that the game does include. There are lots of things to buy. Lots of projects. Plenty of potential partners. A good but incomplete approach to building a more complex version of LIFE for experienced gamers.

A worker placement game with a fascinating game timer -- an advancement from adolescence to old age, complete with bonuses and detriments along the way -- The Pursuit of Happiness really shines because of the stories.

There really aren't too many difficult decisions, but that's okay. The theme is attractive to non-gamers, and the mechanisms allow those very people to partake in the fun.

But those stories... oh, man, they are so interesting and often hilarious. We love sitting around after tallying up the scores, and telling the tale of our lives.

The set-up can be fiddly, and the game eats up a fair amount of time (and a significant amount of table space), but I enjoy The Pursuit of Happiness too much to really care.

Kickstarted it.

It's a nice game, but it drags on - there are at least 2 turn too many, and too many actions per turn. The game itself is a weird combination of drafting and worker placement, which could be interesting if the cards offered more, mechanically speaking. The art is great and the theme is awesome, but after an hour the excitment for the theme is gone, and there's still a whole hour of min-max calculations to slog through. If you start at turn 3, could be a good family game.

Friedemann Friese put out a similar, but darker themed game over a decade ago called Funny Friends. It was also a card-drafting game, but the main difference here is that in Pursuit you need to collect resources in order to meet goals that are listed on the cards you draft. In FF, you draft cards to adjust various levels of traits on your player board in order to meet the requirements of your goal cards. Funny Friends, like many of Friedemann's games, suffered from an unclear rule set that takes a bit of work to figure out. We really enjoy Friedemann's game and I have to say that had a major influence on our opinion of this title.

In PoH, you have a certain number of action points which you use to draft cards or collect resources. Some cards are single actions that you pay for and collect points or resources and then set aside. Some cards have shared goals in which all players can participate. Some cards stay in your tableau and have multiple increasing goals to meet (by paying resources or action points) and usually give you an income and/or have an upkeep cost. If your tableau goes over a certain size, then you have additional costs in stress to pay. Stress is the most interesting aspect of the game. The more you do, the more stressed you get. If your stress gets too high, you die and are out of the game. You can still win, but you won't collect any more points. As you age, stress levels become harder to maintain and it can be challenging to survive the full 8 turns of the game.

Some of the cards are pretty funny. There are goal cards, but they are shared, which in my mind works at odds with the theme of creating an individualized life. I much prefer the secret hand of personal goals you get in Funny Friends. Cards are not really connected to each other and the game doesn't really create the cohesive life-story that Funny Friends does, where you need to make a number of similarly themed choices in order to meet a larger goal. At the end of a game like this, I want to be able to go back through my cards and describe how my life went, but there are so many cards you churn through that are chosen more for what they do than what they are, that the game does not effectively create that story. Nothing is all that hard to accomplish in the game, it is just of matter of focusing on this versus that. Ultimately the loose game play and surprising lack of narrative arc will keep me from picking this one up.

Pursuit of Happiness is a typical thematic game with mechanisms and depth taking a backseat to theme. While appropriate for a game of life, the resulting gameplay doesn't manage to keep me fully engaged across the length of at least 90 minutes it takes. The theme wears thin and the creaking cogs and wheels grind through it.

The worker placement lacks tension as spots aren't blocked. Except for a few far too rare cards with hearts that grant a stress reduction across section borders, it usually doesn't hurt much when another player takes away a card. Enough alternatives available. Managing the stress level in practice isn't as interesting as it promises. Getting one extra action at the cost of losing another action each following round relegates stress to a limitation rather than a decision space. The same is in part true for exceeding the limit of three for partners, projects and jobs which is only feasible as long as no new section on the stress scale is reached.

In later rounds repetitiveness sets in. Even if theoretically different, the process for acquiring and developing projects, jobs, items or relations is similar. The game develops into a tactical optimization exercise of squeaking out a few points more once the general direction (i.e. job & relationship status) is set. When the thematic decision of upgrading your relationship to a family is equated with a plain VP generation method, the enjoyment of the game nosedives.

While this sounds overly negative, the game has its shiny moments. When your high profile job and your wife keeps you busy and leaves you with a single action while the yoga dude without a steady relationship and an odd job is all over the board with his six actions, you start to think about life. The secret is to ignore the mechanisms and focus on the story. Stays in the collection for now due to this.

I really love this one! All the small "jokes" you can find on the cards, the fun whilst playing,.... But I regret the rules are not so well written. It is not in the correct order to my opinion. You have to read them 5 times before you can be sure of things. I think that some small icons on the board extra would be great (for ex; Players signs on the card spaces so you now for relations and jobs you only place that number of cards)
This card you have to start at L1, an other you can choose,... Refill these row, but not another;; so much little differences to deal with. It also puts the gates wide open for discussions (you can see how many threats there are on BGG!)
What I dislike the most are the summary cards. These are terrible. It has to be possible to explain the game to new players thanks to the summary. In this game this will not happen. For example: You have to pay upkeep. Why not directly mention the consequences if you do not pay??I downloaded the reference cards of Lines42. They are much more "to the point"
I'm glad I kickstarted this one. It's really fun to play and everything is possible. I hope I will play it again soon

Played once solo. As a solo game, it was fine. Very challenging to get 50 points and accomplish all 3 of the tasks. I have a feeling which 3 you need to accomplish will have a lot of influence in how probable it will be for you to win.

The rules could use some better clarifications, and the the chits could vary more in size between the 1 and 5 denominations.

Other than that, one of the more thematic worker placement-type games I've played. Ones rules were established, it had a decent rhythm. And there was a bit of luck that I found to be a hurdle within the card drawings. But nothing too crippling.

In short: a game of life without a soul.

The idea of life stress, short term happiness and becoming old and crippled sounds great. The cards look great. Doing team projects seems nice! However, the manual is atrocious (see the QRC I published for clear rules), and actual gameplay is AP prone. In short: I hated it. It takes forever, nothing really happens. And then you die. Shelving cards feels meaningless.
Never finished a game, so not much played.

If you want 
story telling? buy arabian nights instead.

a game of life?  buy the game of life. Really.

player interaction? avoid, because there is next to none.

a gateway/family game? tPoH is thousands of fiddly rules that will throw any family into dark desperation.

a filler game? well tPoH takes 2 hours too long.

a great solo game? get ODD or Friday instead. tPoH solo, first and last time, won but took too long and felt meh, so it even fails there.

a game with consistent theme? get viticulture essential edition

a worker placement game? tPoH only has WP in the weak, generic sense, you place workers and get to do the action, but you only block yourself, nobody else.

a game with a good manual? Get viticulture, splendor, puerto rico or even tigris and euphrates. 

a game you can immediately start playing? Well, the setup phase is described well. Player order is described. Getting projects, jobs etc is fine. Trouble starts after that. Your first games will grind to a halt.

That said, it took me 4 full days to compile and completely rewrite the manual, as it should have been, and made a QRC that helps enormously in smoothing out the gameplay, speed up things and everything is fine game-rule wise.

However, after stripping the artwork, what remains is just a resource grabbing mechanism, there is next to none depth here to be found. Buy a card, get more resources thanks to that card, buy a second one etc. It's essentially a card game.

So, please GET SOMEONE TO BUY IT WHO CAN EXPLAIN IT, play it a few times and be done with it. This also saves you from getting rid of this garbage.

Container box is far too big (and torn inside but that is a minor). Will have to cut it in half myself.
Play board is needlessly too big.

The rules are too confusing. All of them,  Some points:
- it even does not explain how to score and when. We supposed that getting LTH at a next level would move the score markers during game, but the manual only described end of game scoring. For example it describes upkeep and much later what to skip when it is the first turn. Bad.

- there are 5 different graphical representations of a LTH point, that is a cardinal sin in game design.

- All cards are bland. Icons are non-intuitive and hard to retrieve from manual. For this theme the colors should be bright, it's the disco 70s-80s era (my guess).

The counter chits are cumbersome. A general counter would have been perfect.

AP players can kill this game.

Choice of project / job / partner seems unimportant, and well, everything just feels too blase and there is almost no interaction, except on rare group projects. It is called worker placement, but that is nonsense, your worker does not block someone else's worker.
If there is no interaction, and there is no much fun in playing, it is not a game.

after 1 test play I would say this is an ok game. 

The game is not hard to play, the choices are simple. 

Minus point is the rulebook, the rules explanations are not clear, I'll have to look for explanations from videos or others review.

good for getaway worker placement but not sure will fit for experienced gamers. 

played with 2p and took 3 hours to play. I'm getting bored at the old age because the game is repetitive.

After several plays, I've soured a bit on the game. The game does create a number of AP prone moments that can make the game drag. As well, I'm becoming convinced that jobs and relationships are just not worth spending time on in the game (with possible exception being if you can take a level 3 job and then retire in the same round). I'm losing interest fast in this one and have little interest in playing again. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I found this to be quite engaging and interesting as you build your life (of happiness...and stress). If you want money, you need to get a good job BUT that takes a fair bit of time and you lose "workers" in return. There's a balance to find in when to find a job, how quickly one progresses in a relationship, and if one can find something that reduces the stress level, get it as you will likely live longer and thus be able to do more. There is a fair bit of downtime in this one as you read each unique card and try to figure out the best ones for you as you develop your life engine so to speak. 

The board seemed to be lower quality work and was slightly warped as well.

Sehr geiles Spiel!
Jeder Spieler, spielt sein eigenes Leben. Begonnen in der Jugend, über das Erwachsenenalter bis ins hohe Alter hinein. Ziel ist es das glücklichte Leben zu führen und dafür gibt es jede menge Karten mit jeder Menge Möglichkeiten.
Man hat eine gewisse Anzahl an Zeit, dargestellt durch Sanduhrmarker. Man beginnt mit 6 Sanduhren (Aktionen). Je nachdem wie Stressig ich mein Leben lebe, verliere ich Sanduhren (also Aktionen). Wenn ich ein gesundes Leben führe (joggen gehe, meditiere, etc.) erhlate ich sogar Aktionsmarker.
Ich kann eine Arbeit annehmen, wodurch ich Geld, eine der 4 Ressourcen im Spiel) erhalte, aber ich auch Aktionen pro Runde verliere (Sanduhren abgeben muss). Ich kann eine Beziehung eingehen, die mit Wissen, Kreativität oder auch Verbindungen schafft, allerdings auch wieder jede Menge meiner so kostbaren Zeit auffrisst.
Ich kann mir schöne Dinge kaufen, die mich (vermeindlich) Glücklich machen -> Büchersammlung, Einen Flachbildfernseher, eine Privatschule, ... . Ich kann Projekte durchlaufen, das mich Ressourcen kostet, mich aber auch Glücklich machen kann, etwas im Leben erreicht zu haben, und und und.
Das allerbeste am gesammten Spiel fand ich, dass ich mir meine eigene Story schreiben konnte. Quasi ein second live! Ich habe als reicher Bengel das Spiel begonnen, habe mir von dem Geld meines Vaters eine Kunstsammlung gekauft und merkte schnell, dass das Geld recht schnell durch die Finger rieselt. Also musste ein Job her, der mir Geld bringt. Da ich mich in Kunst auskenne, bin ich natürlich in einer Gallerie angestellt worden. Da mich das aber nicht wirklich glücklich machte, hab ich mir eine Freundin gesucht, die mir das nötige Wissen vermittelt hat um meinen Job zu halten, den ich gebraucht habe um meine Kunstsammlung zu erhalten, die mich Glücklich gemacht hat.
Die Olle hab ich dann im hohen Alter noch geheiratet. Meinen Job hab ich an den Nagel gehängt, was Stress und kurzzeitige Unglücklichkeit bedeutet, aber ich habe alle anderen Spieler um eine Runde überlebt.
Gut, da hatte ich dann aufgrund des hohen Alter-Stresses nur noch 3 Sanduhren und 2 davon gingen für die Beziehung mit meiner Frau drauf, aber ich wurde wenigstens 80 Jahre alt ;).
Das blöde war, dass ich in dem Alten nicht mehr wirklich ein Projekt anfangen sollte. Die Beziehung hätte ich auch nicht beenden können um mir Zeit zu verschaffen, da mir dann aufgrund hohen Stresses ein Herzinfarkt ereilt hätte.
Einfach geil. sehr thematisch stimmig. Wenn es auf deutsch kommt, werde ich es mir kaufen.

Dare I say, Life on steroids?... but only in theme, the game play is vastly superior!  Extremely enjoyable worker (time) placement game!  Huge bonus that most of the jobs and partner cards have each gender on each side!

This is a pretty fun and tight game. It gets pretty thinky at times, handling all those little resources. In this regard it seems similar to Imperial Settlers and I do prefer that one more.
Fun game and theme, it's a nice medium-weight game.

This is a fantastic game. It oozes theme and is able to create a great narrative that stays with you. There is so much variety that the replayability is extensive, as are the different methods to build up your lives. All of the sections interact well, and whilst being competitive, it is not a cut throat game as each of you tries to have the happiest life.
I have played it with my 9 year old who was able to grasp the rules very quickly and really let his imagination run wild with the things he did in his life.
Fantastic game that is going to get a lot of playing time.

This is basically Life but instead of moving around a board, you're using action selection and resource management to get a job, complete projects, have a partner, and take on hobbies/stuff. There were definitely some engine building elements to it, and it had a great concept of upkeep where your partner may make you spend 1 time every phase, but you automatically get happiness, creativity, and knowledge.

I loved the theme and had high expectations after reading through it, but the actual gameplay fell a little flat. I think part of it is that all of the resources felt the same, and we vastly underestimated the importance of stress because we didn't realize that you died when you got pushed off the edge. 

I'm not sure I'd play this again.

I'm not a huge fan of worker place games, but this is a nice medium-light one.  The most satisfying part of the game is the 'life' you build through the game.  It's really a light engine building game where you find ways to convert resources into victory points.  I imagine this will have a short shelf-life for me - maybe 10 plays.  Seems to take longer to play than it should for it's weight.  

Definitely too early for me to claim this (2 plays), but it seems like a heart reward can be a game winner, if you're the only person to get one.  There is a bit of luck in how the cards pop up, especially in 2 player games, since the row is smaller.  May not always get the job level you need to come up.

RATING: 5
At its core, a pretty basic resource management/conversion game. It's not really worker placement as there is no punishment for using a space an opponent already occupies. There is no real competition with your opponents. Everyone is just doing their own thing. The game reaches its climax way too early and fizzles out in the last few rounds as you have fewer and fewer workers available (they get used heavily in upkeep).

I was hoping there would be more tough decisions to be made as far as whether to prolong life or make a mad dash for points and die young. In fact, it is really difficult to increase your health as there are hardly any hearts available in the game.

I think a game with this theme could be amazing, but this one isn't it.

This is an excellent worker placement game about living the happiest life you can manage, whether you decide to focus on career, relationship, projects or experiences. You start out in your teen years, building on whatever childhood trait you chose at the start of the game, and choose your path as you move from your teens into adulthood, and from adulthood into old age. The game ends once all players have died, and you tally up who earned the most long-term happiness, which ultimately wins you the game.

The really interesting part is the way the worker placement in this game is done. Because no one is actually blocked from doing any action they or someone else has taken on the board, however if you have already taken the specific action, doing the same action again will cause you stress, which could affect how much time you get to spend in future rounds and could even cause your character to die sooner.

The stressmeter is also interesting as it's divided into different coloured sections. There are actions you can take to reduce stress, but you can only do so within whatever colour section you are in. If you want to further reduce stress you need to achieve health benefits, like taking on projects like jogging or healthy eating, which will allow you to move down a colour.

In addition to long-term happiness which are essentially points, there is short-term happiness, which is a scale that resets between each round. The happier you are in the moment, the more easily you can progress the projects you may be working on, and the person who are the most happy at the end of any round becomes the starting player the next round.

I really enjoyed this game. I don't really get much into the "characters" I play in boardgame, but this one had my whole group joke around with our choices, like the fact that I went from taking on a Set Creator job one round only to become Producer the very next round was down to my rich dad pulling strings for me (my childhood trait was "rich"), and things like that. We had a lot of laughs and just thoroughly enjoyed the game. I'm really happy with my purchase.

The art fits the game perfectly, the variability in multiple plays is decent with the various starting traits and life goals and the latter ensures a good amount of strategy and tactics to employ.  Really good game overall.

My favorite, so far, of the modern Game of Life games. Much better planning and more interesting effects and consequences than CV, etc. Rules are a little fiddly with the different types of cards and limits and effects for each. Group activities that reward multiple player participation are a very nice interactive departure from the norm. Runs long (might be better with fewer players) but enjoyable.

The theme of the game is fantastic, like it was on CV, but this one is more Game than CV.
In this one you have choices to make that don't depend on the roll and re-roll of dice.

You can consider it to be an excellent gateway game because of the theme but the gameplay makes it a gateway+

You have many choices to make, specially at the start of the game and because of that the game can be a bit long but I enjoyed it. A very good surprise

This is a neat idea that suffered from not being developed enough. It's hardly a game. Watch a bunch of cards roll across the board -- some of them stopping in front of you.  Meanwhile spend 90 minutes tediously exchanging random quantities of cardboard chits for other random quantities of cardboard chits.  It's slow, fiddly, chaotic and out-of-control.  The fact that you can't take cards into your hand  means that you can never do anything but roll with the random way the cards reveal themselves.  Also missing from the game is having children and raising a family -- is this expansion material?  Even the Game of Life had kids!

This is the Game of Life but as a worker placement game. The mechanics are easy to understand and the humour of the cards is what makes the game appealing - so the experience will vary with different players.

Truly a game where the theme makes the mechanics actually fun. A variety of cards with thematic requirements and the game encouraging table talk. I like a game that tells a story. I also like a game that constantly tempts me to revise my short and long term goals. Rules are a bit complex to be a family game, but the overhead is well worth the investment. Highly recommended as a thematic experience and a good game.

Thematic euro where the life decisions have been distilled down to which resources to acquire and which to spend. The idea is commendable but with all actions open for all players and dependent on card drawings, the game promotes neither interaction, nor long term planning. It's also a bit fiddly to keep track of all transactions so The Pursuit of Happiness is neither a gamers' game, nor a family game.

I rarely post comments in BGG, I just read them; But in this case, I will tell you, this game is amazing. Its an euro, with a tough economy to get resources, and could sound dry as any other euro, but NO, its lovely, fun and fresh. I love to create my "life", and see how others build their own. Its really fresh to play this game, to spend 1.5 hours managing your "stress", earning money, develop your career but spending your time...wow, at the end, everyone will die...and see how many "points" of happiness you earn in your entire life.

Recommended for 3-4 players, its a next level game to introduce euros. For hardcore gamers could be just another euro with a different theme, in that aspect, it is hard but it does not punish your actions. 

Conclusion: Buy it if you play with your family, friends and non hardcore gamers.

While it is a fairly medium-light worker placement game, the theme is spot on
Half way through the game you will be saying things like, "My wife takes too much of my time" or "I earn so much money from my job but I have no time to spend it all"...sounds familiar? :p
The gameplay focuses on trying to complete life projects, getting a job to get you money which you spend on items that make you happy like a boardgame collection or a new sports car. The better quality these items are, higher is their upkeep cost but they also give you move long term happiness in return

Divertentissimo gioco che ha il suo punto di forza nell'ambientazione. 'La ricerca della felicità' è un classico piazzamento lavoratori ma la costruzione del film della propria vita, cercando di evitare lo stress e ricercando le piccole e grandi gioie quotidiane, rende questo gioco da tavolo molto simpatico. Nessuna meccanica innovativa e un regolamento immediato lo rendono un family game con diverse trovate ironiche e reali che ci faranno sorridere.

Artipia has some great games (like Drum Roll and Among the Stars), some mediocre games (like Briefcase or New Dawn) and some very bad games (like Lap Dance of Shadows over the Empire). Seen the high average rating (7.5 on 31/07/2016) on BGG, I had hopes that this would be again a great game. But after 1 play, for me it's more in the mediocre category. 
There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, but basically all the different cardtypes doesn't matter that much, you're always collecting resource A (and for me money is just a resource like any other) to convert into resource B in addition to hopefully some extra points (in this game LTH). 
With 4 players the game did last a bit too long for what it is.

I wanted to love this game. I love the colors and the idea of this game. I really wanted to try playing it. It is a pretty simple worker placement game using time. Each round represents years of your life. As you go through life you get a job and relationship end stress. If you become too stressed then you die early. 

For me the game was too real- it was like work. I enjoyed playing the game but at the end I was exhausted and it just didn't work for me. It was too much like work and not enough game. I am sure many will like it, however. I do recommend trying it if it interests you.

A good concept that doesn't really work in execution. It's supposed to be a worker placement version of the Game of Life, but it doesn't really succeed at being either an interesting efficiency engine game or a fun life narrative building game.
On the engine side, there are some interesting decisions around the ways you acquire resources and use them to gain points. There's nothing new or particularly well done about it though, and it feels watered-down to open the game up more for the narrative side.
On the narrative side, the options feel arbitrary and restrictive. Many of the options are amusingly quirky like owning a pet turtle or leading a biker gang, but it felt like clicking together goofy story blocks more than creating a life.
Overall, I'd much rather play either a finely-tuned euro with fascinating and difficult tradeoffs to consider, or an indie RPG where the players work together to create a compelling and memorable story. The Pursuit of Happiness fails at both.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The game has a lot of good ideas, but it needs a bunch of improvements. It is basically an action selection game. Money is very tight in this game; I feel that there is not really a good way to get a lot of money in the early rounds, especially if L3 jobs appear early on when players can't afford them. I felt that it was extremely hard to get hearts since they didn't appear on very many cards. Thus, it was hard to get more player time tokens in this game. Almost every job and relationship had an upkeep cost of more time, which meant that the number of actions in the game dropped as the game went on. It may be even better to ditch jobs and relationships completely and just go for projects and entertainment since they don't usually require additional time.

Bought this for the theme, hoping it was a gamer's version of Life or board game Sims. Sadly, the theme does not shine through and cards all end up feeling the same. Quickly becomes a game of just numbers and moving pawns around. A big disappointment for me.

An upgraded version of "Life" where you can make choices of what happens in your life and isn't just up to luck. In the end, it is a worker placement game, but not one where you are blocking other players and sort of block yourself only. I absolutely love this game and can't wait to get it to the table again.

RATING: 6.2
(+) Very colorful and cheerful game. Every player gets happy playing it!

(+) Very accessible game, you can explain this to and play it with everybody.

(+) The game tells a story which feels real. The mechanics make total sense (you grow up, study, get a job, buy stuff, develop a relationship, undertake projects, ... When you go for a well paid job, you need to invest more time and efford into it and when you try to combine too many things at once, you are prone to stress). The projects you can try to achive, the things the game allows you to buy, the partners you can match up with - they are all really funny and nice, and it doesn't take too much imagination to see a whole new story coming together every time you play.

(+) Mechanically, the game allows you to do some engine building by combining the right cards (if you go for a creative job, it helps to engage in an inspiring relationship with somebody who shares ideas with you and to invest in creative activities and items. The fact that you can 'grow' in projects makes thematic sense and gives players some feeling of progress

(+) Some players live a little longer than others (mainly those who have taken care of their health and players who have avoided too much stress in their lives). The end game is original and also makes thematic sense.

(-) The game is really light, too light for my taste. It almost feels like a party game, but it probably is a little bit too heavy to be a party game.

(-) The game might get a little repetitive after a while as you keep trying to run the same engine you are building. As the game is quick to play, this is a minor complaint however.

Conclusion: A very good, fun and suitable game for players enjoying a light boardgame with some real content. Too light to satisfy a true gamer.

Approx game time: 15-20 min/player

CV expert, mondhatnám.
Klasszikus munkáslehelyezős alapokon nyugvó erős kombógém. Itt is el lehet kicsit veszni a lehetőségek sűrűjében, éppen ezért tanácsos talán nem túl gondolni az egészet. Igaz, egy erős, mély stratégiai játékkal állunk szemben.
Fentiek miatt kissé AP veszélyes, és a kártyák fluktuációja miatt is kevésbé tervezhető előre (ami csökkenthetné ezt a hatást). Érdekesség, hogy ennek ellenére gyorsnak gondolom.
Aki kedveli ezt a fajta játéktípust, annak biztosan tetszeni fog. Remek illusztrációk segítik, hogy az ember jól bele tudja magát élni a játékba. Teljesen jó játékélményt ad, attól függetlenül is, hogy éppen hányadik helyen végez az ember.

I liked a lot The Game of Life as a kid when I played with a friend who owned it. And then I grew up and bought and found out, guess what? IT SUCKS!
Thankfully a new Game of Life is around. It has meaningful decisions, programming, variability, great replayability... But it's strongest point is that it accomplishes 100% it's main goal; to tell a story of a lifetime. A realistic one. It is unbelievable how well it does it! You get a good job that is time consuming. You do not have much free time but you got the money. You do not build up your collection, you pay and get everything. Or you want to have a life full of activities and fun and personal time. Sorry baby, I do not want commitments! Whatever you try it has a meaning.
Technicaly someone can point out that player interaction is very low, but that is reasonable and compatible with the scenario. Downtime is very low and most of the time you get to plan your next action. I have not found any noticable faults yet.
There is another thing that I believe it is unique and of great importance about this game. It delivers a great message that may look odd and even bitter at start but if you think of it and manage to realise it you will have gained the best lesson a game could probably give. The game ends rather sudden with players' innevitable deaths. Projects are left unfulfilled, feelings like "aaaarghhh, if I had one more round...". Wow...Wow...No my friend you may not have that extra round, you will never do everything you would like too. But you should at least have a full life. Get up and start chasing after your dreams. The time is not enough so do not waste it. I wish I would give this game more than 10.

Played an epic match of The Pursuit of Happiness KS edition with my wife and kids. Very fun worker placement mechanic where you are investing your time in various endeavors like learning, performing activities, developing careers, having relationships and purchasing items until your heart's content over the course of your life while trying to fend off stress that will ultimately send you to an early grave. It's the kind of game that is so fun and in fact quite hilarious to play that who eventually wins is really of secondary concern to the enjoyment of the pursuit.

Nekem rögtön a CV-t juttatta eszembe a játék, csak ez jóval komolyabban építi fel egy ember életét, természetesen kocka nélkül. Célunk a boldog élet keresése, különböző feladatok megoldásával, pénzünk élményekre költésével, jó munka kifogásával és persze egy komoly, jól működő párkapcsolatra is szükségünk van  a teljes boldogsághoz. A játékosok idővel gazdálkodnak, ami tulajdonképpen munkáslehelyezéssel működik. Van három nyersanyagunk és a pénz, amivel a fentebb említett témakörökben tudunk kártyákat szerezni, amik valamivel jutalmaznak. Érdekes a kártyák többfajta játékba maradása, azaz, hogy körönként kiaknázható, több szintjéből egyik használható, illetve későbbi körökben tovább fejleszthető. A játék rettentően tematikus, hihetetlen jól működik pl. a társállatok megjelenése, ami életünk előrehaladtával örömet okoz nekünk, de végül sajnálni fogjuk, hogy elveszítjük őket. A hosszútávú boldogság mellett nagyon fontos figyelni a rövidtávúra is, mert ha boldogok vagyunk, könnyebb az egyes feladatok megoldása. Fontos része a játéknak a stressz sáv, amin helyzetünk több vagy kevesebb cselekvési lehetőséget ad körünkben.
A játék jól működik és sokkal mélyebb annál, mint elsőre tűnik. A kombózós játékosok imádni fogják. Az előkelő pontszám egyértelműen a tökéletesen tematikus játékmenetnek szól. Fantasztikus  történeteket alkothatnak a játékosok menet közben. Nagyon tetszett.

RATING: 7
A bit hard for me to rate. It's not a great game, for me, but it's a good game for the right group. Thematically it really shines. You really do feel as if you're building a life, choosing activities, projects, things that make a difference and tell a story. (After my early years of drifting in a motorcycle gang  I got a job as an art director which was fueled by my massive comic book collection.) The game itself involves choices and strategy but is not super deep. My wife and I both prefer a bit more complexity but we had fun with our friends who are not big gamers.

The game is rated medium light but I actually think it's more of a medium. So many fiddly little charts to keep track of. It feels heavier than it has to be. The rules are also not fantastic. Some basic concepts could have been more clearly explained.

So not a gamer's game but a fun thematic experience for the right group. We've played it twice already with our semi-gamer couple friends and they love it, and we like playing it with them.

This game is more enjoyable to me as a storytelling exercise rather than a game. It's surprisingly luck-based with what cards show up (especially if NO health cards come up...you'll never get to lower your stress and live beyond the 2nd old age stage) and you can't really specialize in anything, making strategy not much of a factor. Every decision is thematic and you can tell really cool stories, but I just don't think there's much there as a game.

This game is brilliant.  It is thematically solid - balancing recreation and responsibility, managing stress, and indulging yourself a little, in the quest for long-term happiness.  It is easy to learn, simple to understand and easy to play.  It has a low risk of inducing AP.  And the in-built solo variant is great!

Great game!

Love the theme and principal of the game, but I find the result just bad. It's not worker placement as placing a worker somewhere does not block that place for others. All you do is convert resources into other resources, eventually ending up with a huge pile of resources that aren't even worth anything.

I still have the feeling that a good game could be made with this idea, maybe even with the same components - but what they published is awful.

tl;dr: nice engine builder

Not many games have the theme of managing one's own life. But hidden under that theme is a pretty standard engine builder. Get some cards to build a bit of an engine to get a number of different resources that you can eventually convert into points in a number of ways. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but it's all put together skillfully and in a nice, attractive package.
The mechanisms in which you have to take care of your stress and happiness add a nice bit of distraction to your main strategy without complicating the game too much.
As I said: it's all put together skillfully.

Not bad for our first run through.  Took about 3 hours for a four-player game, though, admittedly some of that time was referencing rules.  While the rulebook isn't long, there are several small rules that are easily forgotten.  Also, I would recommend that Events be excluded.  They don't add much to the game and the way they are implemented is fiddly and you can easily lose track of their effect.

I am taking points off my rating for component quality.  The KS version cards are flimsy, card back colors are not consistent and after unfolding the board twice I already have the cardboard in the center of the board coming off.

Played one game for now and really liked it. Despited the comments I found it way more heavy then I expected. Lots of tough decisions and opportunity for AP. Our first learning game lasted 3,5h. The rules could have been more streamlined but I don't think this is a gate way game, not an easy and accessible worker placement in my yes.
Mechanics and theme fit together very well and I like the illustrations and humour on the cards.

Richly thematic "Game of Life" style game loosely driven by a worker placement mechanism where the workers represent the time spent living.

A game I thought I would like far more than I did. The differences between zero-upkeep items, activities and single-round projects was confusing. The rules were a little lacking on some of the finer details. Overall, a pass after playing it despite having planned to back it via Kickstarter.

The theme is great and is what attracted me to this.
It can drag on and I think it is important for people to play their turns quickly to alleviate this.
It is kinda broken with the hearts. There are only a handful to be got in the game and realistically, only a few will come up in the game and it pretty much is a case of the person who gets the most hearts wins. Sometimes it is impossible for a player to get a heart to compete with another player who did. I am trying a few house rules to fix this but not settled on one yet. The best so far seems to be that if you get 3 short term happiness you can spend 2 'workers' to rest and gain a heart that way. At least this prevents it being impossible to gain a heart.
Despite the issues I still have a lot of fun with this game hence it's rating.

Very strong solo game. Difficulty level seems to be around where I prefer. I'm roughly only at 25-30% win rate with a bit under 10 plays under my belt. Even if I get to improve that to 50-60% as I get better, I think it will still hold my interest.

Clear thematic choices enabled even a non-gamer friend of mine to grasp the relatively complex (for a non-gamer) rule set. We played with Pets but no Events or Trends, so mostly base game (and the Pets are a simple to understand extension of Items/Activities).

I believe this game has a lot of casual or family gamer appeal, especially for people who are turned off by sci-fi, fantasy or other overly "nerdy" themes, while still having enough weight to satisfy more hardcore gamers. It doesn't do a lot of new stuff as far as worker placement games go, so if you're a hardcore Agricola/Caverna gamer this might leave you underwhelmed, but this is a lot less dry than an Agricola, Puerto Rico or Caverna if you're going to play with non-gamers, casual gamers or with family.

Also, my non-gamer friend really enjoyed the emerging narratives over the course of the game (i.e. she teased me a lot about doing a Summer Fling one-time activity just before I upgraded my Partner from Dating to Relationship).

RATING: 5
Thematically, most things in the game fit. However, because of the way the theme was applied, I felt the game gets less fun the further along you get. I guess that's fitting, because after all, who likes to get old? The problem is the old age rounds or even the last adult round pretty much felt like a chore. You have fewer actions either due to upkeep or age-induced stress or both, and have to calculate how to spend those few (at best) actions to maximize your points.  Some players can "die" a round or two early from stress, so then they sit there doing nothing until everyone else has finished one or more rounds.

Szuper játék, nagyon tematikus eurogame, klasszikus munkáslehelyezős alapokon. A munkásaink itt a múló időt szimbolizálják, míg nekünk különböző életcélokat "kell" végrehajtanunk. Tiniként kezdünk, majd munkába állunk, barátnőnk/barátunk, majd esküvőnk lesz, közben gyűjtögetjük az anyagi javakat és szabadidős tevékenységeket is végzünk, míg meg nem öregszünk... mindezekért persze erőforrást kapunk, melyekből új kihívásokat teljesíthetünk. Rengeteg jó ötlet került a játékba, tényleg nagyon tematikus és a kivitelezés is rendben van.

Yes! A rare euro with perfect theme-ing. Decently strategic, with every action and card beautifully connected with the subject. Doing a little bit of one's life narration based on the cards played is a must. I was afraid that after several plays I would, like in 99% of card games, completely ignore the story and just play for optimum effect. I did start to play more efficiently, but I cannot ignore the subject - bravo!

The Gamers version of the classic board game Life...or a strategic worker placement version of CV. The theme is so strong in this game it’s hard not to laugh and cheer on each other’s characters. Very enjoyable, I just wish you could stop other characters or interact with them a little more.

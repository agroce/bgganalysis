An interesting way to start a game, but the time it takes to get out is probably the biggest inhibitor to using.  Probably has the shortest playing time of any game I own.

Ok, this is definitely not a game, but I rated anyway a 5, because it's a funny alternative for choosing starting player.
Fun fact: a friend read all the cards, then _seriously_ stated that he didn't want to use it because he would win (resulting in being 1st in the following game) less than 50% of the times against the game owner. Awesome.

This is just a really silly way of selecting a start player, but it does take away the stupid way that most rules suggest.  With certain games I'm just tired of the same person going first all the time, so this adds a nice twist.  I was also surprised that it came with a cool start player meeple that's big and looks much more useful than the marker that comes with many other games.

FYI...I record one play of this game in an entire day of gaming, no matter how many cards are drawn.

Thanks again to my 2008 Secret Santa!

A joke rather than a game, Start Player is an useless and light-hearted addition to any game: using a die to see who rolls higher is still the easiest way to determine the first player (and my favorite) but sadly not every game has dice, most of those have dumb methods to choose the starting player and, let’s say it, sometimes it’s nice to rely on a different way to fix who goes first.

Seems like a daft enough way to work out who's gonna go first in any given game. Just my thing! The rules and the artwork on the cards are quite funny too, which adds to the all round entertainment.

It's hard not to like this as it just goes better than "youngest/oldest player goes first" or whatever the normal crap is.

Start Player...I don't really consider this a game so much as a pre-game activity. It's just another way to determine a start player, and being an Rock-Paper-Scissors purist, I dislike it a bit because it encourages people to do something other than RPS.

Of the two editions, I prefer the cards of the original, collectible one because they are much more gamer oriented. I dislike the collectible aspect though, and clearly the licenser realized what a terrible idea this was when they picked it up. Unfortunately, the newer edition, while not being collectible, has much more generic cards, and isn't as much Geeky fun, so both editions have plusses and minuses.

I rate both a notch below average because I'd rather play RPS, but if you really like Alspach's art, or need a non-RPS, non-Shocking Roulette way to determine the start player, then it's perfectly serviceable.

The subtle complexity of this game mixed with it's perfect combination of theme and functionality make it one of my top games of all time. I have played this game literally thousands of times, but have yet to master it.Plays well up to 99 people as indicated on the box. It is playable solo, but does not much provide much challenge alone.(I think I have won like 90% of the time solo). 

joking aside this is a great little accessory to have around for samusement purposes.

For when you want to find out who is the start player, you can play Start Player! Very handy. Every gamer should have a set of these cards. Sure, they can be silly and a little unbalanced (I usualy "win"), but it's still great for when you can't figure out another way of picking who goes first (and don't want to just roll dice).

Kind of tough to rate this as its not really a game at all, but its part of the game database so I guess we rate it as such. 

A kind of interesting way to pick a start player if another doesn’t present itself or tickle someones fancy. 

Essentially flip over a card and follow the instructions to see who should go first.  Not a game but then that isn’t really a knock against it, as it doesn’t try to be.

As with the collectible version, it is what it is.  It's possible that some of my plays of this were logged to the collectible version.  They're basically the same, but when I saw the meeple I knew I had to log it here.  So now I have plays logged to both.  Isn't that exciting?

This is a tough one for me. It is a fun idea and I occasionally use it, but it isn't a game. My definition of a game involves choice, and here you draw a card and pick a start player by whatever method is stated. This is really more of a game "accessory" than a game. It's a good accessory, which is why I'm of mixed feelings about scoring this so low, but if I hold true to my ratings criteria, I can't score this anything other than a 2. (Since I gave Candyland a bit of credit for the theme, I'm giving this one a point of credit for the amusement.) But really, if it sounds like a fun idea to you, then you should get it.

Does what it says on the tin, and does it with a hefty dose of good humour. The problem, and it is a significant one, is the print quality of my Z-Man deck, which is dire and smudged. As this is one of the very few criteria I can judge the game on, it is almost entirely responsible for the low rating. Plays not logged!

This isn't really a game, so rating it is kind of weird. However, I think it is useful, especially when playing with large groups (5+).

Pretty much every time I log a play here with more than 3 people, I've used this deck to determine starting player. That would put this at my most played game. Ha.

How can anyone not give this "game" a 10/10? It's literally just a way to determine start player. There can really be nothing about it that you should find boring, as it's not a "real" game!

This is a great set of cards! Some of our game guests exclaim its the greatest game Ever! It's a joke...really but, everyone seems to really enjoy the start player cards! For us, we use the spin the finger or the start player cards to make the 1st player choice now and no one seems to disagree! I just wish there were more cards...been through the deck several times now! Needs an expansion or we need to make our own.

A game that was probably inevitable, and now that it exists, I wonder what took so long?  "Choose a start player" has to be the worst sentence in any rules booklet. This fills the niche in a fun, humorous way.  Hooray!

Now, if only something could be done for "What do you guys want to play next?"

There are a lot of card prompts that are stupid.  The first person to give someone else money? The first person to jump up and down on one foot?  Lame.  But there are some that are useful and I play to sort through the deck and use only the good ones.  Start Player is still an improvement over dropping a randomly selected player piece out of your hand.  

The giant Start Player meeple is cool looking, but wholly unnecessary.  It was probably necessary from a marketing stand point to put something in the box other than cards, but I will not ever use the start player meeple as intended because I've already got a very effective method of determining who goes first in the second game that gets played--the winner goes last.

While I'm always looking for games that play well with six players I feel this one is a little too short to really get into and therefore hard to rate. Plus, it only allows for tactical play unless players are willing to use the cards as a bucket list (things to do before you die), and change themselves into different beings - not all of these are necessarily improvements. Even then, a lot of the parameters they're looking for are beyond your control - it's not like I can ask my mother or father to provide me with any more siblings, or that I'll be allowed to knock off one or two of those I already have. And that's another thing - a winning card at one table might not be so at another table - there's too many variables that depend on your opponents. Players have an unfair advantage for being the tallest and shortest, having the longest belt, the biggest feet, the most and least siblings, have spent the most nights on a boat, can take a drink the fastest, drink chocolate milk and shower frequently, can quickly hop on one foot, have travelled extensively whilst living closest to their birthplace, has the most buttons and the most of these undone, is wearing a one piece white bathing suit with the most pockets... it's as if the designer has rigged the game so he can win every time. Besides all that the cartoons are rather clever and fun.

For the gamer who has everything (else) ... .  Not a game as such, but quite a fun way to determine the starting player when you've tired of 'youngest player starts ...' etc.  I bought it on a whim, and felt a bit silly, but now my wife and daughter actually want it brought out to determine the start player when we play games!  Go figure ...

RATING: 7
A much funnier way of determining who goes first. 
In many games the rules states that "The oldest player is the starting player." 
But this istn´t fun if you always play with the same people and that one player always get to go first! 
Rolling dice to see who goes first is also pretty lame. Two people rolls a 3, they go again, both rolls a 6, they go again......And the rest of the players around the table has fallen asleep! :)

This game sorts all of this and gives you a little game before you actual game!

RATING: 7
Pretty decent game. Definitely has an incredible amount of components and realistic scenarios, the whole GMT thing. But I don't really think it makes for that great of a game. It's that GMT detail obsession that sort of yes, perhaps creates a realistic simulation but the game itself is rather boring to play I have found. Only played it twice though - maybe I need to go through all of the scnenarios...

Just learning to play and have now played 4 scenarios multiple times each.  My initial impression is that the balance of some scenarios is off a little as my regular gaming bud and I both feel that way.

That said, I'm guessing we just haven't played enough yet to know that for sure.  As we've played the same scenario a couple of times the winner (German/Russian) changed and then seems to have "settled" no matter which of us plays which side.

I like this game.  I like the order matrix mechanic.  I like the speed of the action in the game (tanks, for example, may be able to cross the map in a single move).

A winner and a challenge now to solve the problem presented to each side in each scenario.

BIN: Not for sale or trade at present

Another winner from Chad Jenson. Tight play, interesting choices and decisions, a clever action-point mechanic whereby actions taken yield initiative to the other player, clever use of dice (d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20), and -- of course -- TANKS!

RATING: 8
Great game with lots of interesting choices. The initiative mechanic is a great innovation to platoon level tactical game which doesn't feel like you need to read a 300 pages manual to play. My only gripe is that due to the latter, some fine details are missing and especially using the guns don't feel much different than utilizing the armor (except for basic things like facing requirements and ammo type). Or as someone once said 'If there isn't a To-Hit roll it ain't real!'...?

Overall if you like CC:E/P, you will like this as well - great design from Chad...not the best though (I still prefer CC:E) - but it is only no.1 in the series.

RATING: 6.4
good value for the money, yet a bit lengthy to play and little variation in AFVs, considering the vehicles this division actually used, I would have expected some more & others represented. 
But again lots of components included considering the price it retails.
And no, it is not Combat Commander with tanks.

Update 
after such a long time waiting, seeing the small expansion for FF coming up on P500, I am disappointed , exp. taking to long for to little. Feels like they thought adding some Tiger counters but little more justifies an expansion. 
Oh, and I do not think the fan base was desperately waiting for Artillery men counters on half a counter sheet... Really a pity.

RATING: 6
A little disappointing.  As with CC I enjoy playing this but leave feeling unsatisfied.  It may reflect the real situation somewhat in that I feel that I set up the starting positions and then after that I have little control or difficult decisions to make.  The events take a course of their own, determined by the initial plan (setup and victory conditions) and the outcome of combats.  Whilst this was fine in Upfront, for example, here it takes a long time to come to resolution.

It is not [family=22797][/family] in terms of realism, but I don't care.  This game is just a lot of fun to play.  The orders matrix reminds me of some cool Martin Wallace-inspired wargame doohickey (think: command blocks in [thing=65825][/thing]).
The rules are easy to read, and the game is very original.  Big thumbs up to Chad Jensen.
Oh yeah, please don't think for a second that this is [thing=21050]Combat Commander[/thing] with vehicles, because that is absurd.  I do not like CC.  This game rocks.  Big difference.

RATING: 7
I really like how simple and elegant the rules are. Basically every rulebook I read makes me wish it was a Chad Jensen product. 

I love the scale, with platoons that break down into squads. Leaving vehicles out of CC was genius and getting enough vehicles into each scenario here so that losing one or two doesn't put you at a huge disadvantage is great. It shows a real understanding of the pitfalls of the tactical scale.

I don't like rolling so many damn dice! On of my favorite parts of Combat Commander is just flipping over a card and having everything you need right there. I'll probably try to find a functional dice-rolling app for my phone if I get this on the table again.

I'm not sure what to make of the orders system. I really like the initiative for actions to determine whose turn it is to do stuff but choosing actions is a little more cerebral than I was expecting. All in all it's good but I would be fine with something different as well. The leadership cycling gives incentives to focus the action on different parts of the board but it can feel a little artificial somehow. I hear it can get a bit clunky in the larger scenarios and I believe it.

Speaking of larger scenarios, boy am I probably never going to play some of them! I have hopes that the new game in the series comes through with the promised shorter scenarios so I might get it on the table more often. 

Honestly, and I know it's not fair to compare it to CC, but I would like it more if it had a broader scope like CC. I know that's hard to do without getting into ASL levels of counters but it would be cool to have some more varied options. I also miss the multiple victory conditions and the more interesting time advance system.

I would take this over any other combined arms game on the market but it's not going to be my go-to tactical game as long as CC exists. It'll be my go-to tank game, though.

Excellent game! The rulebook is clear with adequate cross references. The matrix board gives a variety of options which makes the game never boring. The map boards are well designed and the scenarios slowly introduce the new player to the core rules of the game. You must have familiarity with CC to appreciate the great novelties of this game that only apparently is like CC...but it takes a whole different path. I prefer this over CC since it is more detailed, slightly more tactical.

No he logrado que este juego me guste.

Particularmente la matriz de acciones no me desagrada y me parece hasta una mecánica divertida (aunque no es una buena simulación de un combate). El juego es bonito y está bien producido. Pero...

- Los escenarios son demasiado largos debido a las mecánicas y cuando llevas 5 horas tirando dados resulta extremadamente repetitivo. Todo te llega a parecer igual una y otra vez.

- Resulta eterno eliminar las unidades tamaño pelotón. La distinción entre escuadras y pelotones y el tener que estar cambiando fichas toda la partida no ayuda a la jugabilidad en absoluto.

- Podría ser de la Grossdeutschland o de cq. formación alemana en el frente ruso. Casi nada de chrome en ese sentido y en general falta tb. más sabor histórico en el juego. No es suficiente con meter el organigrama divisional en un libreto (para mi prescindible) hay que implementar detalles en el juego.

- Algunas mecánicas me chirrían. La melé se me hace rara y farragosa (laaaarga) y la melé entre tanques ya me parece anticlimática totalmente. 

- Demasiados dados. No me importan en general, pero este juego es extremo en ese sentido.

Initial Impression: I don't generally enjoy tactical level games too much. Of all the tactical level games I've played, this one seems the most interesting. The mechanisms are well thought out and integrate nicely with the theme. The command system is a novel system that works well, as is the mutiple die combat system. Although there are only 10 scenarios, they seem meaty enough to provide hours of play.

10 plays: This design has many subtleties. Each scenario emphasizes unique tactics and rules. Learning to play the initiative system is important to reach competency with the game. I'm enjoying the game more now than in my initial sessions and hope to experience all the scenarios.

Excellent game with innovative mechanisms, originality, tight rules. Fun to play, great production. Scenarios are not all interesting though and wristage can be tedious at times. Overall a great addition to the hobby at a scale somewhere between ASL and Panzerblitz (75m hexes and platoons).

It does suffer from a weak scenario roster and the same "end of the world" issue of other tactical games, a mad rush for VPs at the end of the game as if there was no tomorrow, including with AFVs entering objective hexes at all costs.

Also, I am somewhat put off by the damage rule which turns a platoon hit twice into 2 squads with only one carrying the current hit marker. It is in effect a bonus for the defender which suddenly gets a fresh squad for free due to enemy action. I think the cost for Deploying should be payed for immediately.

This is a very different gaming experience from Combat Commander.  At this scale the engagements are almost epic.  It seems to me that the tactics one employs must be very well thought out, and I am just not that good at it yet. There are not as many surprises as there are in CC but that is how it should be. I like this game but need to play it more before I can get comfortable with it.  Also the scenarios take more time to play than your typical CC scenario.

I'm liking this more and more as I PLAY TEST THE GAME. CC:E probably still is my preference at this point.  I think I just enjoy that scale.

This game delivers on the nail-biting, sweat-inducing, heart-pumping dynamic that CC first introduced me to.  This one is going to grow on me, I can tell.

GREAT, GREAT game!  Exciting, easy to learn.  The rules cover almost all situations and are easy to work with & find things in.  The scenarios are all fun and range from small to quite large.  It's a great game for a group, 1 on 1, or solitare. The cards & random rolls change the situations quite often.  It's the best game I've played in years & years.  I've tried all the scenarios & anxiously await a follow-up game.  

I've taught it to 10 others & almost overwhelmingly all positive!  When will the Tiger's appear in the game?

Only 1 small issue - the maps could be more substantial, as they are easily torn.  Be careful.

Great production, great rules writing and lots of research went into FF.  There's also a lot of modern wargame design ideas crammed into it.  Too many in fact.  Some are great (initiative track, asset cards, command markers) that really add something to the gameplay.  Others are ideas that should have been left out as they either add unnecessary chaos or excessive playtime (order cubes, opposed rolls).  In the end FF is a game I want to like more than I actually do but it just falls short.


*Edit* - After some more plays I've decided that FF just isn't good enough.  I'd rather play ASL if the subject is WW2.  Traded.

I'm not feeling the general vibe for this game and I had high expectations. 
Too much dicerolling for me, with op fire,opposed rolls, return fire and platoon reduction I felt I was in danger of wearing the dice out. Feels like a dice game rather than a wargame. 
The orders matrix is initially quite cool but I dont feel it represents Historical strategy or tactics...its too limiting (Though as a game its a fine mechanism)
I dont like the counters, colours are too similar for German/Russian, and i dont like the side view its makes the map look a mess since you do need to orientate them for facing. With no names or Historical designation they also feel very bland, very generic. I felt like i was fighting a battle based purely on numbers.
The Asset cards and main display have all warped, dissappointing given GMTS usually Stella standard.

Overall i put this alongside Conflict of Heroes, a strong game but not for me. Its in that no mans land between ASL and Memoir 44.

Hasnt changed my mind that Chad is a truly great designer, just this one isnt for me.

RATING: 3
Good game.  A little too long and heavy to get to the table very often right now but hopefully the play time will decrease with experience.  Sometimes it can get a little tedious as there are no fire groups for combining groups of units and occasionally there will be lots of low odds attacks to resolve.  Is drier and more analytical than the crazy, chaotic narrative of my favourite game: Combat Commander but that might be a plus for many other people. Density of counters can be annoying frequently. I can see why initiative mechanic might seem gamey to some people but I play games, not simulations and find it deliciously painful to decide what to do.  Rating might go up if we can learn to play faster.  Rule system is a marvel - after just a few games have almost NO need to refer to manual - amazing!

After a few more games:  There just isn't any "magic" in this system for me.  I respect the game and really want to like it but just don't have much fun playing it.  It feels dry and tedious and I don't have much enthusiasm for playing it.  

Way too much dice rolling!   I thought I liked dice but come on.  Traded away.

Played a couple times, enjoyed it more than Combat Commander. 'course, I wasn't a CC fan. But FF is still a bit fiddly, chaotic, and slow-paced for me. It borrows the combat resolution system from Conflict of Heroes almost wholesale, which isn't great because the apparent diversity of results is deceptive - combat resolution actually isn't that interesting. Some odd, fiddly rules revolving around breakdown and recombination, and some statistical oddities too - sometimes a platoon is better off breaking down and firing as squads, sometimes not, and it's not straightforward to figure out. The use of multiple dice sizes tends to further obfuscate probabilities in a way that I'm not sure is productive. And the rules are really horrendous.

Anyway, there is still good stuff here - I like the assets better than CC's cards, and the combat system does play faster and provides a reaonable level of lethality. Opportunity and defensive fire has found a decent set of compromises. The order system is nice if somewhat odd and gamey at times. At the end of the day, I think FF is a much more solid game than this design team's previous efforts, and if I had a friend who loved it I'd probably play. But it's just a bit clunky for my tates, and for me the pacing needed to be tighter. Crazy expensive too. Great that GMT can get people to pay more for games, but $85 list seems rather steep.

I'm hearing things I don't like from gamers I trust.  After reading the rules, I lost the desire to purchase or play the game.  I worry that it plays too slowly and is open to gamey tactics that have nothing to do with those employed historically.

RATING: 2
First in a new series of tactical games focused on a particular formations which fights on a WW2 fronts. Some CC design solution with new initiative and order matrix. All in all very clever, but in play game loses its shine and become very fiddly.
Order matrix is too abstract and reflects nothing real. In game we waste much time  on a switching with dice, without any kind of tactics. Initiative track and order matrix is countable and we decide when and where we give the initiative to our opponent. 
Very failed experiment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is well manufactured, rules are clear and elegant, the system is full of good ideas. Yet, maybe as I've played it only a few times (I've played the intro scenario 5 times, number 3 and number 9 once), I would not say I prefer it, say, to Combat Commander. The initiative system is very smart, but I do not like the fact it turns to be a game in the game. By comparison with the game mechanics of other tactical games, in my own tastes I find that:
- Rally is too costly (in terms of initiative you pay)
- Going in melee with infantry is even worse: you have to pay a high initiative to advance and you have to pay again later for firing (to actually have melee)
- You can advance from an enemy occupied hex to an adjacent enemy occupied hex (with infantry) and, as there is neither a concept of routing nor a disadvantage of being encircled, there's no way to hold a line (advancing infantry can get through).
- You can activate the same units repeatedly and this has led us to focus on narrow spots and to neglect other portions of the battlefield.
- We found that dividing Platoons in Squads is extremely effective for tanks and it's not so bad for infantry (as a common experience is often better to fire more times against the same target at lower odds than to fire only once albeit at higher odds). Honestly, it seems that keeping Platoons is not convenient at all (even in melee).
  
Anyway it's a good game with balanced scenarios (apart the very first plays, the other ones have always resolved at the very last activation).

RATING: 8
This game is a blast to play. It has some pretty clever mechanics and the rules are quite easy. I don't think it is as good a game as Chad's Masterpiece, Combat Commander, but still I think this is going to be a very interesting series. 

I do have a few quibbles. First, I hate that they chose silhouettes for guns and vehicles over a top down approach on the counters. I rather liked the sample counters from the playtest images and if you are going to have facing be a factor in a game then silhouettes just look silly.

Next, scenario 1 blows. I don't see how it is possible for the Soviets to win this battle. I don't have an issue with scenarios not being balanced because hey often are real battles balanced? However, in this case the victory points should be set to take this into account. While it is scenario does let you run around the board with tanks, but I just don't feel it was playtested much. Did none of the playtesters see how wacky the balancing is with this?

Finally, I find that the theme is rather pasted on. Really in no way was I drawn into the feel that this was a game about the Grossdeutschland Infantry Division. It did feel like an Eastern Front tactical game set from '41 through '43. I think they should have just stuck with a slightly more generic theme. By focusing solely on this division they are limiting the scenarios that can be created. This is more of an observation than a quibble though. I really did enjoy playing this and look forward to playing it a lot more.

Initial rating after playing Scenario #0 and #1: The game will invariably be compared to Combat Commander. Well, it is no CC, that's for sure. 

Pros: The order matrix and trading of initiative is probably the most interesting part of the game.

Cons: Vehicles, tanks and guns add fiddlyness to the game. I especially dislike paying attention to unit facing, firing arcs and different movement points for different units. Yes, yes, I realize that all this has to be included when adding armour to a tactical wargame, but it also slows the game down.
Scenario play time is considerably longer than in CC. I can see some of the scenarios being played in 2-3h. The larger ones, I assume, will probably clock more around 5-6h. Again, this naturally has to happen with a higher unit density, but it slows the game down when compared to CC.

IMHO - The BEST combined arms tactical WW2 game ever made.  Why?  Of all the games I own (and I own a BUNCH!), this is the one I keep glancing at when I walk by my game room.  Whattabout ASL?  FF has a similar "feel" for being in the fight, but without the constant rule lookups.  Whattabout Combat Commander?  CC games can sometimes be driven by the card draws, leading to an unbalanced outcome for an otherwise balanced scenario.  FF includes random elements, but they never seem to "take over" the game - they merely bump things in a certain general direction.  The decision choices that have to be made playing this game are unreal and something very engrossing and intriguing.  Reviewers providing a score having played the game only a couple of times might not see/appreciate the deep challenges presented by the game.

This game has IMMENSE re-playability.  The combination of multiple dice types with the "die up/die down" mechanism, the block draw for randomizing what can be done each turn, the event cards and the random event chit draws at the turn start.  In short, you could lay out one scenario from this game, play it 10 times, and the "story" of the game would play out differently each time - to a greater degree than just about any other system out there.   The scale perfectly fits the combined arms units, and unlike Combat Commander, doesn't feel like armor has been "forced" into the system.

If you are:
1)  Someone who like the depth of ASL - but laments the amount of rules required to play it;
2)  Likes the storytelling of Combat Commander, but doesn't like how the deck distribution can "take over" the game;
...then you have the game you've been always looking for right here.  Unbelievably well done!

This really is my sleeper game system of all time, and one of my most prized wargames (and I own most all of ASL) in my collection.  I wish Chad could turn this game into a game system like ASL has...I would buy every component!

SUMMARY - IMHO: Chad's magnus-opus (and yes, I play and love CC) and those that haven't taken time to study and admire the flow and variety of game events in system are really missing out.  Chad - looking forward to the next game in the series!  This game system is an absolute GEM!

The game I have waited for, ever since I started gaming, is here. I've played PanzerBlitz, Panzer / 88 / Armor, Eastern Front Tank Leader, Tobruck (old & new), Panzer Grenadier, and anything else I could find in this genre. 

But Chad Jensen has outdone himself, having come the closest to achieving the elusive 'perfect balance' of realism, challenging scenarios (based on real actions from unit diaries), player interaction, logical & smooth gameplay, ease of learning & understanding, replayability, expandability, superb graphics courtesy of Kibler, Brimmicombe-Wood and MacGowan (one generation of artists meeting the next), good display of different doctrines, units and capabilities, and overall fun! 

Add the helpful support from the designer & fans, and you'll see that Chad has done for the WW2 tank & infantry genre that his peerless Combat Commander series did for the WW2 infantry games.

Next step in the evolution of tactical mid-20th Century wargames. Very streamlined system without a lot of chrome (or chrome that is dealt with elegantly, such as the Melee/Barrage tables). Initial rating of 9 based on one play and my own analysis of how the Order/Initiative/Command system drives the game. I don't know how it will play out in the long term, but for now if the game can be played in 3 hours with brisk play this may become my tactical game of choice and Panzer Grenadier may be heading for the sell pile.

RATING: 6
Doesn't live up to the excessive hype.

The core mechanisme of actions selection feels just wrong. Although it add some tension, it doesn't reproduce the way a commander would think on the battlefield, it introduces gamey tricks and side effects.

The game uses a mix of different mechnisms, both inovative and seen before. Some are good by themselves. However seeing them together in the same game often feels gratuitous, the final result don't give a coherent whole, and looks like Dr Frankenstein creature.

The 'hit' markers borrowed from Conflict of Heroes seems out of place here, as in many cases the simple fact that your unit as any hit marker is more important that the exact nature of the marker.

The combat system with different types of dice feels just like an advertising trick, it doesn't add anything to a simpler system based on simple D10.

Dubious as a serie, as the game doesn't scale very well, really gamey and random whith a few units and few command counters. But the game really lag with the larger scenarios.

The 'long' counters are not practical, and even with the large hexs there's clutter issues as soon as markers are added. 

It is easy to confuse squad sized with platoon sized units, as the distinction isn't very apparent.

The opportunity fire RoF limitation is better than in combat Commander.

This is OK as a "game" there are decisons to take and tension. I found it fails as a "simulation". Moreover the portraying of a specific combat unit, here the GD, seems only a commercial catcher. Except from 2 pages of History and a 3 pages OoB. It makes a poor job of showing the specifity of this unit. For this I vastly prefer The Gamers (now MMP) GD games, from the Tactical Combat series.

Overall disapointing, especially considering all the buzz. I'd rather play the same designer Combat Commander games for fun, which delivers. Or ASL or TCS for a more detailled simulation.

RATING: 5
One play in, mixed feelings. On the one hand there are some clever mechanisms here, and the game looks great. Some people here seem to hate the action selection matrix because it gives you a euro feel that causes a bit of a herky-jerky narrative, but I also wonder how many of those people forgot that you can always select an action that's lower on the matrix. The asset cards are a nice touch, too.

However, there are a few things that hurt the game in my opinion. First, as some others have mentioned, is the playing time. There are 10 actions to resolve each turn, and there can be lots of mental anguish during movement, and lots of die rolling during combat. I'm really not a fan of "defensive dice" because it not only adds to the playing time, it always feels like a design gaff. You really ought to boil it down to a single roll by the attacker with adjustments. One gets the feeling it was a way to appease the miniatures crowd who tend to whine if they don't get to roll their own dice when being fired at because they want to be "in control" or some such thing.

To add to that, there's no dice differential effect so rolling 10 better than your opponent has no more effect than rolling 1 better than your opponent. The damage is reduced to a simplistic system where one hit wounds you, the second kills you. Any sort of rout or morale check is purely abstracted into the damage chit, but the chits don't affect the firepower or defensive value of the unit. The unit simply can't move or shoot (or both).

This brings me to my main beef with the game, which is the damage system when combined with the platoon breakdown rule. As any student of [i]Star Fleet Battles[/i] will know (or just about anyone with a decent grasp of probability and statistics), if your goal is to score X hits (in this case 2), it's better to fire more dice at lower odds than it is to fire less dice at higher odds. This is especially true here when you have incredibly high variance in a 2d10 system where you're just adding values. You don't just want to roll high, you want your opponent to roll low. The best way to hit that combo is to make as many rolls as possible.

The result is that it is always better to break down those platoons into squads as soon as you're anywhere near firing range. With a variance of 2-20 on 2d10 in a game with no modifiers, it doesn't matter if your individual squads are only 10 strength instead of your platoon's combined 13, because you're firing 3 times as often and just hoping for the high-low combo anyway. Plus, you actually have the potential to kill a unit with 2 hits, where a single high quality shot could not. All of this wouldn't be so terrible if not for the aforementioned problem with playing time caused by the huge amounts of die rolling that come after recalculating hinderance and cover values once for every squad, and there can potentially be a LOT of squads on the board.

So, at the end of the day, this is just not a game that's going to get to the table ahead of stuff like [i]Conflict of Heroes[/i] which, despite a system that looks simple on the surface, actually includes things like indirect fire and combined arms, something that's lacking here, with a playing time at about half of FF to boot.

RATING: 9
One of the best wargame (series? where's the next one!) that has come out in the last few years by one of the better designers out there.
The innovation of FF as a series is the way the initiative works; instead of igo-ugo or chit pull, the game revolves around the Order Matrix, a 10 row table. At the start of a turn, 10 d10 are rolled and a cube is place in each space whose number comes up. Each of these space corresponds to an order (same or different for each side) and when the player has initiative, he simply pulls a cube from the table and executes the order from that row or any that are lower. He then moves the initiative marker on the track that many space towards his opponent. Should the initiative marker still be on his side of the track, he goes again. if it's not, it goes to the opponent.
Pretty simple stuff which adds Command presence on the map, which have a command radius. Instead of activating units directly, the order is given to the Command presence, which can in turn activate any units in its radius for 0 or 1 extra initiative, depending on its state. Units that are out of this range can still be activated, but for an extra 2 initiative. This creates a tense dance, with the players carefully bidding their time for well place attacks instead of simply moving all units in one go. It does change drastically the flow of battle and for me makes the game.
Love it. Must play it more.

A innovating game with a fresh look on how wargames should be designed. Chad Jensen knows how to make an easy to play and engaging wargame.

This game is the only true contender, in my opinion, to Combat Commander when it comes to tactical combat.

It's a different flavor than Combat Commander. It has tanks but with less of the friction that I like in Combat Commander. The friction that so many wargames lack but is a defining factor i true wars.

Another thing that is missing for top score, is that the game lacks a scenario generator.

A fun and fast (compare to ASL) game with historical flavor and tactics. Unlike Combat Commander, which I consider as an adventrure game, this game has much more tactical elements. A true wargame.

Initial comment and rating based on solo play of scenarios 0, 8, and 9.

This is the best wargame I've played so far. After playing this game you realize how dull it is to have fixed turn sequences. The narrative is always interesting and unpredictable, yet you still feel like you are in control all the time. This, allied with the Order matrix, make for a nail-biting gaming experience.

I love the platoon/squad mix. Besides encompassing concepts such as group firing, it exponentially increases the possibilities for each activation.

The game has cards, but it never feels to me like "card play". They actually enhance the gaming experience, rather than detracting from it (I'm looking at you, No Retreat). 

All the scenarios I've played had a very different feel, and presented very interesting challenges. None of them seemed to have an obvious solution, or a single way to achieve victory. On the contrary, all the games were full of swings for both sides, with rapid and constant changes in the battlefield that required complete change of plans from time to time.

I noticed two features that can create some gamey situations. The first is the Spent unit. Although I understand we are dealing with sequential game events that kind of simulate simultaneous real-life ones, it feels awkward to see a squad being surrounded by enemies and not being able to fire a single shot. It would be nice to have something similar to the Final OP fire in BoB.

Another thing that I'm not totally convinced about is the Advance order. Last game I was able to move a Flak 88 outside of an Entrenchement, through a Wall, into a Building hex, and none of the 4 tanks that were surronding it (neither the MG squad in the back) could try to stop it. Although the designer already explained some of the reasons for this order, it still feels weird to have the ability to move with 0% chance of being stopped.

Of all the tactical games I've tried this has been by far the most interesting, and the only one I can't get enough of at the moment.

-------------

Update 03/13 - Played scenarios 4, 7, and 6 solo. 

This game offers a great balance between complexity and playability. Scenarios are large, with lots of room for manoeuvre, and several battles going on at the same time. Due to their size, you are virtually playing 3 smaller squad-game scenarios at once, moving units from one firefight to the other, which is awesome! Several games were decided on the last turn, and sometimes in the very last activation. Scenario 4 was the best so far, great game there!

However, because of the somewhat epic nature of the scenarios, gameplay feels a little long for a tactical game. Defense rolls can become tiresome, although I can see how they really help mitigating the luck factor during combat. Adding the dice results with firepower, cover and morale can also feel like work, but I don't see how a tactical game could have less math than this one. I still think there are areas that could be improved (lack of Final OP Fire, the invulnerable Advancing army).

I still haven't seen any game with enough potential to replace this one as my WW2 tactical game of choice.
----------
Update 10/22: Played scenario 3 solo. Since I'm running out of new scenarios, I decided to give LnL another chance, but it is absolutely not worth the investment. I also finally decided to learn Combat Commander and played one scenario solo. All this just made me admire FF even more.

Although CC is a fun, fast-paced game, FF really feels like CC 2.0 to me.

- Hindrance in CC works almost the same way as Cover (reducing firepower). In FF they are two very different things;
- Leaders in CC feel quite unrealistic to me. Why does a Leader increase the range of firing units?! Command markers in FF work way better.
- OP fire also feels weird in CC. Why is it that only a single leader and his units can fire during a single Move order? Also, there is no Return fire, a feature that I quite enjoy in FF.
- Let's not even get into the randomness of the cards here. Event chits and the order matrix from FF, although random, hit a sweet spot between uncertainty and control.

It's a pity that we only have a single game in this series so far. I personally don't care that much for historical realism, but rather for verisimilitude. I wouldn't mind having fictitious scenarios loosely based on reality, as long as they felt as realistic as the ones in FF:GD. This system is SO superior to the other WWII-tactical games out there that I can only see myself playing another tactical consim when I get tired of the scenarios in FF. No tactical game will ever be perfect, but among the ones I've tried (BoB, CoH, LnL, CC), this is the one that comes closer to it.

My hope is that a new installment in the series will bring more people to this game.

14/11/16 - After having played more wargames I don't see myself getting back to this one. Just too fiddly and long for what it does. Downgraded to a 7.

Another tight and solid package by the Jensens and John Foley. It's amazing how such simple rules can offer so many tactical options to both sides.

My only (big) concern is that the core of the system (the order/initiative matrix) does not model reality very well and forces the players into an abstract and unrealistic decision-making process with regards to command. Besides the players have almost perfect information and control of all units on the board, what adds to the overall "chess-like" feeling of the game.

All in all, it's kind of a contradiction that so much time and effort has been devoted to historical OoBs, maps, scenarios and unit capabilities when the whole C3i system does not represent very well at all how WWII commanders confronted their battles.

My main complaint, and the reason I only rate this game a 6, is that I just don't like the action selection system.  The mechanic pulls me out of the story and interrupts the flow.  It's like someone trying to talk to you while you watch a movie.

Hmm, tentative first impression and all that. Seems like a good game, but I have many prejudices to overcome from my ASL days: Why can't units form fire groups? Why is moving in the open not more lethal? How can weaker units inflict damage on stronger ones? Why is a hit just a hit, with no regard for how strong the attack was? Where's the rout phase?!

The game also features a lot of strictly mechanical moving counters back and forth, flipping units, and die rolling. So, mechanically a bit cumbersome for what it does.

I enjoyed my first game, but I am not blown away. Still, I would like to play more.

I'm no expert in wargames. This is my first 'proper' wargame after Memoir 44'. I've played combat commander once. I really enjoyed that but sometimes you're burning through cards waiting to get what you want so you can do what you want.

Fighting formations flows beautifully, even when it's not your order you are involved. Command markers, initiative and the order matrix combine to give the game a sublime ebb and flow.

Fighting Formations is a rich tactical wargame with plenty of meat on it bones. The action matrix and the command system give this game a unique feel. The tanks add quite a bit of complexity to the game and require a thorough understanding of the rules to use them effectively, but the investment of time is well worth it. The learning curve feels steep to me as a relatively new wargamer, but it isn't unmanageable. This is robust system, and I look forward to exploring its depths with future plays.

RATING: 6
Combat Commander: Europe is the logical benchmark for Fighting Formations. Gameplay of FF is much closer in feeling to CC:E than I expected which is mainly due to the introduction of fresh "Euro" elements into traditional tactical wargaming. It's not as much an exercise in hand management this time, rather it's action point management. Cards are again thrown into the mix, here as random assets, i.e. event cards. It's a bit more traditional with its dice-based combat resolution with some possibility to tweak the odds.
It's still a tactical wargame but on a larger scale. The addition of tanks leads to much more movement on the map. Hits are more common but this is compensated by the platoon sized counters that consist of three single units when separated. In effect, the introductory scenario already has the length of a medium CC:E scenario which is already a bit too long for my taste. I still prefer CC:E as I can see me being annoyed by powerful tanks tearing up my position in long scenarios.

To me, this is the perfect squad level wargame out there.  I love the order cubes and the minigame of prioritizing when to take certain actions and whether screwing your opponent out of low cost actions can benefit you the greatest.  I also like the command counters and how it is used to make certain units more apt to act, but not shutting down all units on the board.  Best part for me, however, was the opp fire/return fire mechanics, along with the rate of fire rules.  Sticking a German machine gun squad in a building can just cause all sorts of havoc and can be very difficult to silence.

Richard Pardoe kindly taught this to me at BGG.Con 2010, and I LOVED it.

Before I continue, this game is NOT Combat Commander. It's also not "just Combat Commander with tanks". It's a classic hex and counter wargame, but it has some very slick innovations. There's a set of order boxes numbered 1-10 on a track that are available for selection, and when you pick an order, you move the initiative that many points towards the opponent on a push-pull track. Initiative still on you side? Continue. On your opponents? They go. On 0? The player holding the fate card goes.

The more complex/involved orders have to be selected from on high, whereas simple things like playing an asset card, moving, and firing tends to be in the 1-3 range. The track differs depending on which side you're playing. After the first turn is complete, the order track gets refilled with 10 order markers, but they're assigned by die rolls, not a simple 1-10 ordering, so some order levels may not be available the next turn (I'll note for completeness that selecting a "5" order means you can execute the 5 order for your side, or any LOWER value order. If all that's available is a 5 order and you want to do a move, which is a 2 or 3 depending on which side you are, you can still do it, but it costs you 5 initiative)

The other thing I liked was the use of different dice types to resolve attacks. You typically roll 2d10 for shooting at another unit (say), but if you're in an adjacent hex, you roll 2d12. If you're too far away, you roll 2d8 or possibly 2d6. A nice way of making a KISS fire resolution system.

And lest anyone think that these mechanisms are a little too "gamey", let me reassure you that once the action got underway, everything save the fact I was trying desperately to advance my units along the road to capture objectives and the electric tension at the table as the melees unfolded in hexes completely eclipsed the mechanics of the game. In fact, the simple elegance of the system really made it transparent to the playing experience - I was focusing on what was happening on the board and not pausing to step out of my suspension of disbelief to figure out a CRT column shift.

I highly anticipated before BGG.Con, and do so even more now.

I think THIS is my tactical WWII game. Love it! Wonderful rules that are easily referenced, great looking counters, a ton of maps, cards that can add additional surprises (but nothing game-breaking) and theme, and quite a few scenarios.

I've got to agree with others that feel that Jensen should really be concentrating on this series of games rather than Combat Commander (a fun game in it's own right but FF:GD is just so much more superior as a gameplay experience, IMO). Get on it, son! I'm ready to line-up and play any expansions he brings out.

RATING: 4
An interesting angle on platoon level tactical gaming, spruced up with lots of different dice, different shaped counters, and even wooden pieces (ooh! are we really that shallow that that makes a difference in appreciation?  Well, I don't care).   It plays well enough, though the system is quite fiddly. A lot of counters, a lot of dierolling, and as you hit units the counters multiply due to the automatic squad breakdowns. (The term "vehicle squad" to refer to what is in most cases one vehicle or two must be one of the sillier creations I've seen in some time.) 

In play it's tense enough and moves at a good clip, and I when I played I had a good time. The main problem though is that you cannot allow yourself a second to think about what you are doing, and above all shouldn't think after the game about what your actions mean in real world terms. I did and it was the game's undoing as far as I'm concerned. The command control system which in many ways is the heart of the game.  This is where the wooden bits are concentrated and it certainly has a distinct Euro feel to it insofar as nothing you do there has any bearing to anything I recognise as being a factor in running a real battle.  That you fire shouldn't keep anyone else from firing. That someone's on the radio to division HQ shouldn't mean that your people can't shoot (or shoot two or three times).  That you have local superiority in some corner of the map shouldn't enable your people to shoot five times as fast as the other side. Having an airstrike gives the other side a boost in initiative??  That's about the weirdest thing I've ever seen in tactical game. Fortunately the boost is small.  Ultimately this game tries to convince us that the way a tactical WWII battle was run was by the Eye of Sauron, with Mordor's troops falling asleep as the Eye moves on to other parts of the battlefield. There have been other systems that have tried to convince us that warping time by focusing consciousness is the art of war. This one, with no limit on the number of activations for a unit is probably the most extreme one since Rob Markham's Sedan game for 3W.  Just silly.

I can see myself going through all the scenarios once, to recoup the investment.

My favorite wargame. Innovative yet not gimmicky. This will be my wargame of choice for awhile. This was the game I have been looking for since getting into wargames. I couldn't be more enthused or more impressed. Everything immediately clicked.

I can't wait to play this again. Very fun with tons of decisions to be made. This is exactly what I was hoping CoH, White Star Rising, and ASL would be. A complex system that was simple to learn.

Best wargame rule and play book I've ever read.

2 / 5 - Fair.

There's much to admire in the innovation of the command matrix, and the skillful blending of manoeuvre strategy with mechanical exploitation strategy that results. But ultimately I found the game too slow and plodding for my tastes, with a lot of procedural elements and counter fiddling to work through in order to get anything done. The result is a ton of interesting decisions that totally fail to mimic the intense fire-fight action the game is supposed to simulate, let alone the monstrous play time.

After playing the introductory scenario, I very much liked the game.  The ebb and flow of the initiative system was almost perfect and the tension throughout the entire scenario was just right.

There is an excellent balance between the order matrix and the decision you as a player need to make. Do I move, do I fire, do I pick up cards, it works wonderfully.

I approached this game with some caution given my hate of the Combat Commander system, but this game had just the right amount of balance between giving the player control and the fog of war.  Where Combat Commander is chaotic to the point of being ridiculous, this game gets it right.

I bit the bullet and bought this, despite the fact that this scale doesn't usually work for me. Have not played it enough to have a firm opinion on how well it plays competitively, but I do like a lot of the elements in the design. At this level, more chaos rather than control tends to work better for me, and it at least veers to the chaotic side. My favorite game at roughly this scale up to now is probably VG's Panzer Command, but that one is a little dry...I'd love to try this one a few times face to face.

I like the maps.

I'd like to compliment the designer and whoever may have helped with the rules. Loose rules are a pet peeve for me, and this game has an excellent rules set.

Edit: in the end, this didn't work for me. The orders matrix mechanism works as a game, no issues, but doesn't work for me as simulating anything, particularly. As others have said, there is a *lot* of dice rolling. And while I don't consider ASL the epitome of games, the loads of dice rolling in ASL seem more to the point -- i.e., I understand the purpose of all those dice rolls. In this one I mostly don't.

You get plenty of quality components for your money, so not much to complain in that area.

Played the intro scenario, and I am very impressed.  Different feel than CC:E, serves a different purpose, has a different feel, and love each for different reasons.  Love the initiative track, and the command markers really cool as well.

Jan '16: Played a solo of scenario 8 and had a whale of a time.  Lots of dice and the action selection mechanism superb.  I also like the chit draw for damage effects.  I am rubbish at the strategy, however, and the Russians got trounced when they probably should have won had I not been so inept.  Longer to play than CC:E, but this scenario not too bad.  I also did away with the hidden locations for purposes of solo action.  Have played a couple times with two, and really enjoyed it.  Hope it is not too awfully long before i get to play again.

July '17: It was a long time.  Played scenario 4 with Jeroen and despite totally screwing my defensive setup, I did ok in the end.  It is a great gae, but takes a longer time to play.

Another interesting game from the wonderfully productive Chad Jensen. FF is a tactical, armour based hex and counter wargame with an original order mechanic. This takes the form of a pawn that moves along a track from German 20 to Russian 20 initiative points. Each order uses a certain number of initiative points which moves the pawn towards your opponent. Only when your initiative is on your side of the track can you play an order. So, the game involves lots of decisions based on whether to take a number of consecutive small point orders or a large point order. There is also an abstracted command and control mechanic which means those units within the radius of the command counter can be activated cheaply and those at a distance more expensively. On first play this is a solid, enjoyable, if long,game. It will take a number of plays to work out the best strategy and, for me, the jury is out on whether the game mechanic and the historical simulation mesh together sufficiently well.

I love Combat Commander but I'm afraid Chad has lost me with this one. It seems way too fiddly with too many ideas grafted onto the system. I think Ockham's shaving device could definately have been applied here. Which is a shame as the subject is interesting and well researched, the scale innovative and the components superb. In particular, I adore the maps, and regret there not being a better game system, one more worthy of so much top quality art work.

It takes a long while to get used to this rather unique concept. But if you manage to unterstand most of it and play with the orders it becomes a really good game. The only minor critisim is that not all scenarios are well balanced.

Had to edit the rating down, some scenarios have major balancing issues, also how to setup your troops as the defender as far too time consuming (A minor mistake can cost you the game). It should be a little more forgiving, because the attacker doesn't have that problem so much (Especially if it's the German)

Fighting Formations is a great tactical level WW2 wargame. The order matrix is a bit abstract but it works very well and keeps the game going. Fighting Formations might not be a hardcore simulation, but to me it feels historical enough. Many of the scenarios are outstanding (especially the big ones) and session can be played in a day (scenario 2 takes two or three days to play, though). Players are constantly kept on their toes and forced to make very difficult decisions. The system is easy to learn, teach and play. However, it seems to me that it is a lot easier for the German player to get going because learning good Soviet defence strategies takes some time but the scenarios are not unbalanced by any means (I'm always the Soviet player and I have won several scenarios, including scenarios 2, 5 and 6). 

Here are some defence tips for new Soviet players: keep your rifle units in places where your enemy can’t shoot them, face your enemy in a short distance combat, prefer opportunity fire and return fire over fire orders (German return fire hurts!), don’t be afraid to shoot your own units when they are facing Germans in a melee, keep the victory conditions in mind (you’re not supposed to be saving lives).

I would very much like to see new games in the series.

Mechanics is quite innovative and there is a lot of strategy to think of. I love tactical game (I am an Asler and ASL is my fovourite WWII tac game) and this one has captured my interest. Only one thing I don't like very much and it is the damage assignments: too random for my taste, but, IHMO, only a little flaw for a very good game.

Amazing treatment of division tactics on a company/platoon scale. Highlight of the system is the orders vs. initiative where it becomes a cat and mouse type scenario where you are trying to not just overwhelm your opponent but outwit him. Unfortunately, the bigger the scenario the more die rolls have to be made for fire combat and can become monotonous at times. Waiting anxiously for second volume.

Great components
Unique mechanics-the initiative system certainly keeps things moving back and forth-very tough to make plans that actually can follow through
Rulebooks and player aids fairly tight and clear compared to most
gameplay-have not played enough
Don't know how well it will play solo.
Edited after playing a couple of scenarios and getting a better handle on the rules: This is a great game ! The rules are a model of clarity and the player aids contain most of the chrome rules. Have no idea how closely the game models reality, but it is lots of fun-note:I play solo only and the game is still lots of fun.
Edit: although I still agree with the above, the game has been sitting on my shelf a while. It is just not calling to me. Need to play again.

Tense, squad/platoon-level game with several innovative mechanics. Cannot say enough about the initiative system/order matrix--it gives FF a different feel from any other wargame I've played and earns the 10 rating on its own. Essentially, you spend initiative points to execute orders--the more complex, the more initiative that goes to your opponent. Also like the use of multiple die types and command tokens. Lots of decision points and plenty of tension. Only drawback here is that the scenarios are almost all large ones (outside of the training game). Can't wait for others games in the series--we need American units!

I tried, but I just can't get into this game. For one, it doesn't feel like a wargame...doesn't give me that tasty feel. I think the activation cube stuff IS the game, not moving your troops and getting good position. This game also feels extremely random, with far more dice rolls than I'm accustomed to, and I play ASL! For example, if I fire at you, I roll two dice, and you roll two dice, to see who gets the highest number. If I roll higher, I get a hit. But you can return fire, so we again both roll dice. At the same time, we're doing lots of mental math. (My base firepower minus your base defense and any cover you have...the total here is added to my firepower dice roll...the size of dice I roll (d10, d12, d8, etc) depends on factors like range). The game, then, is mostly messing around with wooden cubes and dice with T-34s a la carte. To be honest, if feels like clever mechanics with a pasted on wargame theme!

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after learning scenario and one other small scenario.

Plays cleanly and briskly. No rules lookups after first game. Lots of action and excitement. Unit differentiation works well.

Not sure about the order system, though. It seems as though typically, you'll just take turns choosing the lowest available initiative action. So initiative will swing from German 2 to Russian 2 to German 3 to Russian 4 to German 4, etc. 

Also, the tight command radius and short ranges means attacks take the shape of focused schwerpunkts (sp?), rather than enveloping fire or flanking. This may be a matter of the scenarios I've played, so I'm reserving judgement on this for now. But it is a concern.

This is [b]not[/b] "CC with tanks".  The first few games I had to unlearn several things that are key to CC.  Instead this is a more traditional game where the igo-ugo turn phase has been changed into an initiative mechanic allowing a large (high initiative cost) maneuver by one player to be countered either by a large maneuver by the other player or a series of smaller maneuvers.  But the initiative matrix doesn't just control turns.  Things like OpFire, Reactive Fire also cost initiative, so players find themselves engaged not only with the position on the battle field, but thinking how to most efficiently allocate initiative (orders) to achieve the desired goals.

Not a lot of rules overhead (rules aren't more complex than CC - it is the change in scale that allows the inclusion of armor) but an enjoyable game as I have been engaged and focused on the game as each one has played out.

Certainly my favorite of the "new wave" of WWII infantry games, but largely I'm lefting wondering what great problem the game solves that previous games didn't.  The dice mechanism is neat, but quickly became opaque as it was impossible for my math-addled brain to figure out which was a better shot -- 2d8 with a 1 hinder or 2d10 with a 2 hinder, etc.  I get that many things were combined in one roll, but I'm afraid there are some gamey artifacts.

Still, one I'd play again.

Superficially similar to Chad Jensen's earlier game Combat Commander - same WW2 theme, same designer, same SPI-style clean functional graphics, and an better cleaner rulebook than Combat Commander. Plus they're both good fun games. :)

But there are significant differences (and not just because FF has tanks). FF is less "cinematic"/chaotic and seemingly more strategic/thinky. The command/activation/order system is fundamentally different from CC, and it is quite clever and cool and interesting.

FF has a few similarities to Conflict of Heroes, e.g. unit facing (for vehicles), randomly drawn damage markers, asset cards.

The only real "negatives" for me so far:
* Many scenarios take longer than I'd like
* FF's lack of a random scenario generator. It comes with 11 scenarios, and that's what you get.

I really like the system: the orders matrix, while I don't know exactly what it represents, is very clever and the initiative scale regulates the activation very well. I like the combat with different types of dice and the way the system handles OPs and return fire. My regular opponent finds the sniper die roll too prominent, but I think the struggle to win the sniper adds another layer of interest; I mean, you can always use the fate card to offset the luck.

So far I've been less enthused by the scenarios I've played. The defender really has to think about set up and if you get it wrong at the beginning (which, as I lack experience in tactical games, happens a lot), then you will be walked over. I'm hoping this is less prominent in the other scenarios or that this is just a sign of my inexperience, not only with this particular game itself, but also the genre in general.

My initial impression is that there is a lot of cool stuff in here.  I like the way command is handled through the mission/tactical commands, the asset cards are nice, and it's a nice change of pace to be moving up and down a dice set rather than a CRT.  There are also some nice subtle touches in how the German and Soviet doctrines and abilities are handled, such as differing costs on the order matrix.  It's a ton more playable than something like TCS, and more interesting than Panzer Grenadier, the two primary platoon-scale games on the market.  


** UPDATE**

I'm downgrading my rating on this after more plays.  I don't think the order matrix maps to history in a terribly believable way, and it sets up false choices.  I also think it really creaks when the scenarios get big; definitely stick to the smaller scenarios.  I appreciate the research and the maps, and the general systems are fine as well,  but the order matrix is really what the series hangs its hat on, and I don't think that order system works as either game or history.  

**UPDATE**

And yet...I find myself still attracted to the simplicity and elegance of the systems.  I stand by my critique, particularly when it comes to the two-mappers, but I still find myself hankering to play.  I also love the aesthetics of the game, which interlock with the systems nicely.

The order matrix is a very interesting way to model battlefield uncertainty, I feel much more engaged when being the defending player in this game compared to other tactical war games.

My only nitpick: the very long play time. 5 to 12-hour scenarios for a tactical war game? C'mon.

I ultimately got rid of this because I think Combat Commander is the better game and the scenarios in Fighting Formations are just too long.

Having owned this for a while its gets better with time. Also there is plenty of additional scenarios you can design even with the current counter mix. The GD saw lots of action in the 9 odd months covered by the game. With a couple of home brew counters you can go to march 1943, third battle of kharkov.

Bought this when I got tired of the Conflict of Heroes series. Didn't quite make it as a replacement.

RATING: 7.5
The mechanics are highly innovative and they seem to recreate the vagaries of a battle surprisingly well. The system generates a much more intense back and forth exchange of fire than say Conflict of Heroes.   The component quality is excellent with great maps.  

My biggest complaint is the graphics differentiating squads and platoons, these are way too small, and even with reasonable eyesight can easily be overlooked.  I'm also not convinced about the deploying and mustering mechanics, I think these are unnecessarily fiddly and confusing.  

I like the rule and playbook and the included historical detail.  The length of the game however stops this from hitting the table as often as I would like coupled with the fact I prefer operational and strategic level ww2 games.

This is a wonderful gem. The activation system is a construct of elegance and the hit chit pull system adds the perfect amount of randomness. So many decisions for each action, on both sides and in my mind that's a mark of a good game.

Terrific system that offers multi-layered excitement along with captivating game play.

The Introductoy Scenario (0) is fantastic, and the Playbook is just outstanding.

The game really should have come in a larger box, however. Another potential downside is very long and drawn out gameplay, but that can be a matter of taste.

Unfortunately, I don't find myself playing this one as often as I should.

Absolute fun with one house rule...... 


"On the last order (the 10th), when/if the pawn crosses to the inactive players side of the initiative track, the remaining spaces to track are halved."

Example:
Russian has the fate Card.
Initiative pawn is on Russian side spot 3.
It is order 10, the Russian selects the last order which is an 8.
Init pawn is move to spot 0 for 3.
The 5 remaining spots are divided by 2 and rounded up for 3.
The pawn is moved to the German 3 spot.

Example (worst case):
Germans have the fate card.
Init pawn is on the 0 spot.
It is order 10, the German selects the last order which is a 10.
Since the first move of the pawn is on the Russian side the 10 is halved 5.
The pawn is moved to the Russian 5 spot.

Without this house rule the style of play changes, more like a Euro game.  In most scenarios if the Germans start a turn with 8 or more init can be game over.  So the Germans will need to deliberately leave some units out of command so they can manipulate the init track.  Russians will also want to manipulate the init track but usually have plenty of units out of command.  The last four orders can devolve to a game whereby the goal is to setup a 'worst case' or close enough.  The House rule does not prevent this 'gamesmanship' but does make it 'part of the game', instead of a 'separate game'

-----------

Otherwise, the game is about track manipulation. With the house rule, track manipulation is still there, and so is the Fun.

More depth than Conflict of Heroes and has armour unlike Combat Commander. Good Squad Leader substitute for me (CoH is 'SL Lite' and CC is 'SL with Up Front flavour, without tanks'). 

I personally like the command system, but it does encourage bunching up units. It's also weird, thematically, that by picking an order you deprive your opponent of it. But I still love this game!

The non geomorphic maps and the scale are a plus for me, and the combination of original ideas (the order system) and good ideas borrowed from elsewhere (notably Conflict of Heroes) works perfectly, with little need to refer to the rule book and most time spent making decisions. Can be long because it is highly interactive.

Great looking game with very nice components - counters, maps, rules, cards, etc.  I must say I would have preferred to see top down views on the tanks. I saw the initial ones and didn't like the chicken and chicks look but if you did a straight top down with the dots, like the current ones then it would be ok. I just don't like pointing the side of the tank forward... looks odd.

After a read of the rules I was non-plussed but then laying through the intro scenario it all started to come together. A VERY revolutionary system. Quite free form and flowing with with no set turn sequence as such, just choice of actions and initiative. The activation table is good, chit pull for damage is nice, order system fantastic. The rules complexity is not really high, just the approach is new so it takes some work to get your head around it. 

Things I'm still up in the air about are the amount of wristage involved as there is a lot of dice rolling for shots, results, morale, etc. CC:E uses cards whicha re much faster. Timewise length of play is medium to long but it never feels long. A good thing!

The system really shows the difference that tanks make, and how lethal they are. Pity the poor bloody infantry. As a friend said, there is a reason that they have " "THIS SIDE TOWARDS ENEMY" printed on the front of them!  Nasty nasty nasty!

I've read some reviews that say that there is nothing new in FF:GD. This is a load of cobblers. This is quite an innovative system and like no other tactical level WW2 system I've played before. It is quite a mind bender to start and the learning curve is pretty steep on the first game or two.

Have to play more to see.  :)

As far as tactical games go, this is a pretty good choice.  I'm not nuts about the scale, but the battle plans and the choices made feel realistic, and let me abstract away a lot of the intense number crunching that is the norm for this type of game.

The obvious comparison is to [gameid=21050], as this game has the same publisher, designer, artist, and even theme.  They are clearly sister games.  I've played CC:E only a handful of times, and FF only once, but I lean toward Fighting Formations at this point.  The addition of mechanized units is a great bonus, and the combat is abstracted just a bit more in this version, something that I crave in tactical games.

Fell for the hype and bought before reading the rules.

Very innovative, even if it justs recycles mechanisms known from euros. I don't like the dicefest though: I attack a hex with two broken platoons, that's 3 rolls. They break into 4 squads, so another attack is 5 rolls. Add return fire, that's 2 more rolls after each of the attacks. It doesn't break the game, but it's a squeaky wheel in an otherwise well-oiled machinery. I don't hate buckets of dice known from block games and such, but this is not regular buckets of dice. It's buckets of opposed die rolls!

Un buen juego, me gusta. Es digno sucesor de la línea de los venerables PanzerBlitz / PanzerLeader / ArabIsralei Wars, pero creo que las alabanzas que leo por ahi son un poco exageradas. La resolución del combate y los daños se inspiran bastante en la serie CoH, pero FF tiene detalles geniales como el "hindrance" o el "rate of fire". Aquí puede haber mucho más fuego de oportunidad (con coste, claro). Me trago sin problemas el combate casi sin tablas (es más, me parece ágil) y las fichas de mando. 

Me resulta un poco extraña la matriz de órdenes. No se, tengo un poco de recelo a que mis ordenes esten dictadas por los cubitos que quiera quitar al oponente más que por lo que quiera hacer en el tablero. Ya veremos cómo va resultando en la práctica. 

Las dos primeras partidas al Escenario 0 han resultado un poco lentas para mi gusto.

This is a brilliant game on the battalion level. They method of unit activation is really unique. I like how it shifts back and forth, Moreover, I like also how command radius plays a role.

A very tolerable tactical WW2 wargame.  I'd prepared myself for the ludic nature of the order matrix, but the gameyness of the Asset cards really bothered me; using this mechanic for arty and general battlefield events was fine, but for unit loadouts?  Units gaining mortars or antitank rifles for one round and then losing them is just awful game design.  An enormous blemish on an otherwise enjoyable light wargame.

Mechanically very straightforward.  Excellent player aids in the box.  Played our first game with almost no reference to the rule book.  Plays briskly with little to no down time.  Tactically interesting.  Players are engaged during the opponent's actions.  Mechanically different from Combat Commander, but still has the incredibly clear, playable, player-focussed style of play and presentation of that game.  Excellent game.

Has several unique mechanics (initiative cubes, adjust dice size vs dice roll modifiers) that play surprisingly well.  Unlike card games, the ability to choose activities with a lower cost helps reduce the frustration of wasted turns because you don't have the right card.  Despite length of game rules, it plays fast, requires very little rules lookups during game, and was exciting.

Innocuous platoon indicators and the use of profile views instead of plan views for vehicles trouble an otherwise beautiful graphic presentation. 2nd printing (upgraded box & counter cardboard) is better.

Platoon/squad break-down mechanic adds to play time exponentially. Contested die rolls can become tedious when multiple mission command markers are out and a single move order bogs down under the weight of multiple Op Fire shots. The order matrix is a mechanism that bears no relation to reality that I can discern, but at least it's right up in your face and not hiding in a deck of cards.  

However, I like the scale and the clean rules, the maps are wonderful, as is the research. I like the initiative system (I also liked it in the Horus Heresy remake...). It's a fun game that models combat at a scale that is a bit neglected, platoon-level, which is a shame because it's at this scale that one can really appreciate the tactical interaction of armor and infantry.

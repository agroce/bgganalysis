very high fun factor, very nice components. advanced + some optional rules recommended(check out alan emrich's living rules) otherwise - in my opinion - Confederacy has no chance. on the other hand tends to play a bit too long when adding too many rules. I'm not American, but I think the game is a classic. probably too simplistic for hardcore historical wargamers.

RATING: 5
One problem I have found with this system is if one player is able to string together several combat victories early in the game then this player acheives a troop quality superiority that is hard to overcome. If the Union manages to do this it's lights out for the Confederate player.

US Civil War campaign game, 1861 - 1865.

Great point to point, variable marches and unit promotions treatment of the ACW. 
Plays fast and fun supporting up to 4 players with some "diplomacy" required as each side has a limited # of marches per turn!

Lots of possible chrome to add for flavor and balance.
I have the GDW edition which has a very small footprint.
Excellent game to introduce people to strategy/adventure gaming!
As with all "hit on" systems wonky results are possible. This game has chrome to add that helps mitigate skewed battles.

A classic.  It's that rare wargame that is over 25 years old that ages gracefully.  It is quite simple, but wisely utilizes a basic/advanced/optional system of rules so as to increment the complexity level and allow the players to customize the level of chrome they want.

The basic rules are quite simple, yet provide an excellent gateway game.  It is not your detailed sim on the war, but it has lots of fun, assuming that buckets of dice are your thing.

RATING: 9
Its great for its optional rules to tweak the difficulty and increase or decrease realism of the game. Kinda light but not ridiculously simple either. Lots of replayability. Cant wait to explore it deeper with some of the advanced rules. A fantastic game! I can play this game anytime.

Simpler type war game, so probably not for a deep wargamer.  Rule variations (included in the game) allow for major tweaking which I like.  Excellent components.  Major complaint is campaign game is long - approx. 4 hours - playing any other way is ok, but not as good.

I own the Phalanx Games version (3rd edition) and it is very nice, in terms of production quality and play. The basic game is quick and reasonably enjoyable but you really need to play with some of the optional/advanced rules to make this one shine. The Union has a rough time early on and the CSA really doesn't have a chance later in the game without the extra rules. Be sure to check out the link to Alan Emrichs website for a few more interesting optional rules. My rating will most likey go up after deciding which optional/advanced rules to use (not a trivial task). 

Overall you have about 13 pages of rules broken down into basic, optional and advanced. The problem is that once you decide you want to play the game you have to still decide how you are going to play. Are you just going to use the basic rules? The basic and the advanced rules? The basic, advanced and optional rules? Which optional rules?  There is even a few additional rules/errata/FAQ available from the designer called the 3.1 rule set. You get the picture. I would say go with the the whole rule set and don't leave anything out. But by then you still end up with lots of rules in different rule books and you've lost some of the simplicity that the game promises.  A House Divided is still a great game but this type of piecemeal approach to game rules is not always what some people want in a game like this.

The American Civil War pared down to the barest essentials.  What's there - rail and river movement, cavalry raids and the value of experience - is done surprisingly well, with a real sense of the geography of the war.  Advanced and optional rules provide a menu from which to add detail.  For such a simple game there is also surprising depth to the tactics and strategy.  

Just a couple of criticisms.  A combat system that allows veterans to be mown down ahead of raw conscripts feels odd.  Playing the whole war takes a lo-o-ong time and might well get repetitive.  Happily, all of my games have been decided well before 1865.

RATING: 8.5
A House Divided - GDW version - is my first wargame. I exchanged it for [gameid=12629], but after many years I bought the Phalanx edition.

[u]Pros[/u]:
* Easy combat and clever movement system.
* Units can be promoted from Militia by Veteran to Crack status.
* Every turn a unit can be promoted so that your army quality grows over time.
* Multiple fronts.
* A simple game that reflects the American Civil War very well.

[u]Cons[/u]:
* Only the victors army of a battle got one unit promoted; a double punishment for the loser.
* If you only play with the basic rules, the South gonna have a very hard time to survive. Your only chance is to move cavalry behind enemy lines and win by gaining more cities than the North. An experienced Union player could easily counter this.
* If you play with the basic and advanced rules, it is still hard for the South. The game has far too many game turns. For the North there is plenty of time to build up and achieve victory.
* The player has to find out himself which optional rules to use for a balanced game. The publisher should have come with recommendations.
* Both the GDW and the Phalanx edition came with far too few entrenchment and flag markers.
* The Army limit force you to count the on board units over and over again, which is pretty annoying. Simplification is recommended.

[u]Thoughts[/u]:
* Play with both the basic and advanced rules for a more or less balanced game. There are still too many game turns though.
* The Containment rule is pretty useless since the South is always short on units. It is better to move armies to reconquer ports.

[u]Hints[/u]
* Entrench units as much as possible.
* If the Southern stack is too strong, try to outflank him to put him out of supply.
* Make sure you build enough cavalry before you reach your army limit. After that it can be difficult to build cavalry.

RATING: 5
Easy to play wargame with a half-decent excitement level, but I don't see how the South can win.  The North begins with a 50% troop advantage, which soon becomes impossible to overcome. Taking Washington, DC can't happen unless the Union player makes a terrible blunder.  So the only Southern strategy I see is to build cavalry quickly, make "jumps" and capture as many northern cities ASAP; you'll still need better "march" die rolls than your opponent, though. (Variant: South adds +1 to "march" die rolls 2 through 4 for first two years.) Point-to-point movement system is nice, components are very good. A bit too-wristy combat, however -- just try a battle between two lone militia units and you'll see what I mean. Wouldn't mind seeing an American Revolution version of this.

Nice wargame that can be completed before your kids graduate college.  Does a nice job of tackling several strategic aspects of the ACW.  Transportation & logistics, combat experience, and multiple 'fronts'.  It is a light enough wargame for Euro-gamers and a meaty enough wargame not to bore the socks off a grognard.  It likely won't shine for either though.  Solid and worth playing.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

Initial Impression: The component's of my Phalanx edition,although gorgeous, do have some functionality issues. In particular, when placing the 1" units on the board, all the important city info is obscured. Still, the game is playable and this is my preferred edition. While reading the rules, I was worried that the game might be too light to be interesting for me. Having played the game, I now understand why this is a classic game that's stood the test of time. A simple ruleset with thematic optional rules that don't add much complexity combined with a sandboxy feeling of the conflict and lots of interesting decisions. There's a lot to love with this great gateway wargame and it will have a permanent place in my collection. I just hope I can get it to the table again soon.

Initial thoughts (or, excuse me while I ramble a bit): 

Those who praise this as the best ACW game "ever" need to get out a bit, as in to a library that has a decent collection of history books covering the ACW.  This is not intended to sound snobish (and if you knew me, you would understand how snobish I am not), but if one wants to be "true" to the spirit and the complexities, etc., of the American Civil War, one can do better than this.  Yes, it might mean having to read a longer rule book, but why not?  

Superior components; all games should meet this standard.  The map's colour pattern or design is a bit awkward to the eye.  This is rather sad, given the high physical standard.    

The lack of any real effort at leadership rules is a major gafe in any game on the ACW that wants to be taken seriously.  Though both sides do not have to stick to the script, as written in the history texts, it still seems resonable to ask both sides to stick to what was historically possible, and in this game, you can get some ahistorical situations, e.g., stacking to the hilt in Richmond and letting the rest of the South die on the vine.

There is no CRT; combat is similar to RISK, and "this is not a good thing," to quote Martha as she went to prison for crimes against humanity.  

Is there "strategy" in this game.  Yes, but like any game, you have to learn its "secrets."  

Given the fact that naval superiority was one of the few areas where the North was, indeed, superior, it is lame beyond words to restrict naval invasions to the luck of the die; in this case, only a "six" will do the trick.  :arrrh:  And yet, there is a decent set of advanced/optional rules to allow the South to both defend its coastal cities and pen in those Yankees who want to see deep into the heart of Dixie.  :arrrh:

Is it fun?  Yes, with the right expectations of what's in store.  

Is it a good "game?"  Yes, if you allow for an almost total disconect from history.  This is not an American Civil War game.  This is a game that happens to use the ACW as a "vehicle" for getting to where it wants to be.

Is it a decent historical simulation of the American Civil War?  No, not by a country mile, whether it be measured in Indiana or Mississippi.

A lot of fun that allows you to set up and play the whole war with what feels like a lot of realism for the effort in learning it. There is a more chrome-filled game called For The People which may be more for the grognard that wants less of the generic feel and instead detail and flavor of events. I would like to use AHD as a campaign context for a miniature campaign that shows that every such mini-battle is not an isolated event.

RATING: 6
Great two-player game encompassing the whole of the American Civil War. Rules hit only the highlights of the war: rail movement, mass combat, cavalry raids, river movement, and the effect of driving leaders like Lee and Grant. The great reprint by Phalanx is a must-have for any ACW wargamer.

Update: These impressions primarily cover the original edition. The "chrome" added in the Phalanx reprint seriously hobbles the Union with the weird "command roll" table. (How many marches a player may have as well as the number units in battle they may command). The morale rolls and recovery roll...The more you add, the worse it gets.

This is not a bad game, simple, yet with interesting choices and some tactical details. Not much on euros for really engaging gameplay, but hey, it's on the American Civil War.

I think there are two issues that keep me from calling A House Divided anything other than mediocre:

a) The proliferation of optional rules. The basic game is unwinnable for the South (one could convincingly argue that the war was unwinnable for South, but this is supposed to be a game after all). So you'll need some of the optionals and whatnot. The problem is that all the optionals have various trade-offs in terms of game balance, excitement, etc., that it's going to take a while to figure out what mix you like and is best. The overall game smacks of "hey, we got this clever underlying system going, here is what we think might make the game really work, why don't you work out the details for us?". A House Divided is not a complete game. Only some combination of extras will make it a complete game. If you work out what that is, let me know.

b) It's just too freaking long. The game can get pretty repetitive, and chunks of it (especially the very early and very late war) are pretty uninteresting, but the system is random enough that it needs a while to play out or it's just a crap shoot. This problem, not so much of length specifically but of pacing, is ultimately a show-stopper. It takes too long for interesting things to happen.

So, A House Divided is a near-miss. The new Phalanx edition is gorgeous, and it's fun to play once, just to see that euro-like wargames were being made back in 1981. But even then, there were games a lot better than this being made. In 2004, this needed to be more seriously updated. Are you telling me that that this is a game that has been in circulation for 20 years, and they still couldn't do better than an unworkable basic game and a smorgasboard of optionals? Not good enough.

A very good light strategical Civil War game.  I actually prefer playing this solitaire over more realistic, in-depth games of the theme like The Civil War or For the People partly because of the ease of play and I just love the components of the Phalanx version more.   Game time can still be very long though.

RATING: 10
6 plays [Score= 5 CSA, 1 Union as follows: (i) Confed army size victory 1863 after taking Baltimore, 3.5 hrs, but played recruitment rules wrong; (ii) Union victory 1865, Federal stumbling early with both sides building WW1 style trenches across almost the entire front, then a slow Federal vise, with a last chance long odds Rebel assault on Washington in late 1864; both sides suffered from getting supply lines cut after invasions(iii) CSA plaguing Union by many cavalry assaults on northern towns and cities, slowing Union advance to end of '65 with only 2 objective cities taken - required constant recounting of recruitment cities, a 7 hour session; (iv) Union slow vise preventing most CSA infiltration, slowly cracking through kentucky/missouri, then invading and taking Charleston - just when CSA seemed doomed, Union oversight allowed CSA to throw everything at Washington and take it (3.5 hrs), otherwise prob would have been Union victory; (v) Union successful containment of CSA, very slowly pushing through the midwest and west thru 1862, naval assaults succeeding in New Orleans and Mobile, but after Union overreach in late 1863, CSA retook New Orleans; Union pressed down through Mississippi in 1864, weakening CSA economy lead to Virginia hole and fall of Richmond, more naval landings and marches leading to call of all CSA victory cities but Memphis in late 1865, where defense retreated to turtle as large Union forces marched east and west, but Union needing 1 more turn to attack, not quite reaching except for 1 cavalry to try to bring in Union forces via reinforcements, but slaughtered by the CSA defenses in 1 battle round...thus CSA squeaker game clock victory! (5.5 hrs) (vi) Union intrusions in the middle and west (Memphis fell early, Mississippi River half Union; lone Union unit took Atlanta) hampered by sizable CSA intrusions into Ohio (instead of retaking Atlanta); Union tried to contain the troublesome CSA invasion while pushing forward; CSA took Baltimore at one point when DC defense was weak, and recruited there, extreme threat, but Union quickly managed to retake Balt. in critical battle; Richmond and Charleston fell in 1864; a small Crack naval invasion took Mobile in late 1865; a huge Union force fought down the Mississippi River to the gates of New Orleans when time ran out - another CSA squeaker victory (6 hrs). I played the Union each time so far.] Wow, what a fun, gripping wargame.  I want to play again soon!  Bookkeeping suggestion: use player cubes to show current army size (current number of units), in addition to flag markers counting army size max (recruitment city points owned). Rules Set used so far = Supply, Crack promotion only from battlefield, Confed port garrisons, Union RR Advantage.   I'm thinking about the game a lot... A great one! I own 2 copies, GDW 1st edition & Phalanx 3rd edition.

Terrific wargame that accomodates pretty much any level of player thanks to modular rule "components".  There's tons of dice rolling but as a result there's some pretty dramatic battles, sweeping turns of fate, and a great fun factor that keeps the game from being too stodgy.  The promotion system is great and the overall ACW atmosphere adds to a solid, accessible system.  Phalanx edition, is of course, beautiful.

One of the best operational wargames. Very playable and enjoyable card-less [u]point-to-point[/u] movement game, great replay value and depth. Simple rules but tough strategic decisions. It has three manuals, one for basic rules, one for advanced rules (and some optional rules) and one with lots of optional rules (tens of ways to customize the game!) and scenarios. [i]I play the advanced rules (without Leaders & optional rules).[/i]
The third edition components are very high quality!
I always loved to play good point-to-point map games and AHD is the perfect game to fill this gap.

This is a super game in that it provides a very good ACW game with very simple rules. That said, one can and should use all the rules, especially the command & leaders. Lee is terrifying! I have found on a couple of occasions that the game start to drag when it gets to the stage where the South can't win except by lasting to the end of the game while the North can't lose unless he makes a silly mistake. This can make the game very cagey & attritional.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The basic game (with a handful of advanced rules added) is a fairly elegant depiction of the broad strokes of the Civil War. It was certainly good in its time, but unfortunately its time was 20 years ago. For my tastes today: it takes too long to play (there are a *lot* of turns if you play through 1865), it's too random (the activation die rolls can totally control the outcome), it's somewhat repetitive and colorless (nearly all the "chrome" comes only through increasing the complexity by adding optional rules), and it's hard to figure out what combination of advanced and optional rules are actually worth using.

This is the Phalanx edition, called North and South. There is no mention of the title "A House Divided". The map is larger and flatter, as it consists of only 4 pieces instead of 6. The cardboard chits are also more "luxurious" than the ones in the newer version. The latter has some extra chits though, which are quite handy, plus a special player guidance sheet for each of the two players. I believe a combination of the two editions to result in a really complete version of the game.

A relatively simple and quick-playing ACW game, though the overall playing time can be a bit too long. Definitely not a simulation but a decent enough game.

I highly recommend some of the optional rules, especially the supply rules, which I would probably refuse to play without. I think the command table is probably essential, too, but the rest you can mix and match depending on the skill level of the players involved. 

These days I prefer a little more depth in my ACW games. I also think the playing time is about 1/4 longer than the mechanics can really support if the game goes the distance. Still, it's not bad from time to time.

An unbelievably good game of Civil war strategy. Rather than focus on the generals or nit-picky special events, this one focuses on the geography and to a lesser degree on army experience.

This and an old hand me down copy of Tactics II back in my youth in the 90's got me into wargaming. I played A House Divided damned near religiously, and just seeing the 2nd Ed. artwork brings back so much nostalgia. Would love to get the third edition to relive my youth. 
Funny side note: since getting back into the hobby over the winter (after probably ten or so years away), I'm afraid to play ACW games because of my love for this game. I own VG's Civil War, but have yet to play it for fear I'll be disappointed. 
I think if I get a copy of this, I can overcome that weird hurdle.

Always an interesting experience.  I prefer the first edition rules, which some reject because of the possibility of a sudden Southern victory.  Cautious play by the Union will be enough to block that threat, but the benefit is that it usually takes other games a passle of artificial rules to force the Union to move slowly in 1861.  Here a scant 4 pages of rules suffice to produce a entertaining and, for the scale, believable game.

Its been a long time since I played this game. Wish I had the time to play now.  We used to play it at work when going through slow times, or after hours (I worked at a game publishing company).  The beauty of the game was that you could play the entire war fairly quickly and easily, whereas many of the other games on the market were too complex and grand to play quickly.  This was an office favourite with everyone except our boss (he didn't like playing games published published competing companies; he was odd that way because you can learn a lot from seeing hat others are doing).

Phalanx edition has very good components, thick counters, mounted map. Played with advanced rules, not the optional ones, which I think add unnecessary complexity and dice rolls.

Not a bad game, but repetitive; I saw lack of flow and variation, so that it becomes monotonous after several turns. Besides that, it's too lengthy for what it is, a light wargame with a short rulebook.

There is a certain dependence of luck in movements and recruitments, which could be discouraging and imbalanced at times. Recruitment is also weird because forces on recruitment pool depend on battle casualties and troop promotions. Sometimes the South player will need to suicide troops in hopeless combats to obtain forces to recruit in other parts of the map. The snowball effect is clear: battles provide the victor with promotions and also troops to recruit, loser only troops, if any. Strategy therefore is more focused on battles themselves than territorial gains.

RATING: 7
Interesting, and in the grand scheme on things, a well-designed game.  A no-nonsense base game rule-set and a whole bunch of optional and advanced rules to add in when you're familiar with the game. For my tastes however, I'm not sure I'm totally behind the dice-heavy combat resolution. It's a whole lot of dice-chucking and when it comes to recruitment, movement, and combat it's hard not to think that dice luck slightly supersedes skill.  But as long as you try to railroad through the luck and set up the best chances you have given the slightly unpredictable outcomes, I think this is a game for you. I'm a light wargamer and have a couple of the "block wargames" from Columbia games that are also dice-heavy but I enjoy them slightly more than this one.  (Maybe because of the hidden movement element?) I rate this a '7' because my lack of enthusiasm has to do more with me as a gamer and less with the game.  Still, it's hard not to think of combat as being a bit sloggish, especially when no side is getting the roles and nobody wants to retreat.

One game played as the Union.  Didn't quite finish it although I was well on my way to victory, I think.  Richmond would have been very tough to capture, however.  

My opponent and I both agreed that the dice rolling grew tedious, but I enjoyed the rest of the game.

I have the older 1980s GDW puzzle board version. Good game in its day. Need to upgrade to the newer updated game and graphics, though I hesitate to spend $50 to buy the same game for a nicer looking board and counters. I like Civil War games. I like Strategic level games. And I prefer to lean towards the lower complexity games. So I like this game.

Estupendo juego de estrategia sobre la Guerra de Secesion. Su mayor virtud reside en que logra reflejar las peculiaridades del conflicto con un reglamento sencillo.

Es divertido llevar cualquiera de los dos bandos, aunque son muy distintos. El Sur debe intentar aprovechar su superioridad cualitativa inicial para ganar la guerra con rapidez. Si el Norte resiste, debera llevar a cabo una larga guerra de desgaste para derrotar a los confederados.

Recomiendo aplicar TODAS las reglas avanzadas y opcionales, a excepcion quizas de las de suministro. Son sencillas y contribuyen a dar mucho mas sabor al juego.

RATING: 8
A relatively simple ACW game that is a bit abstract, but House Divided more than adequately scratches the itch whenever you desire to wage a strategic level simulation of America's bloodiest conflict.

Purists who want every aspect of the ACW represented (politics, every leader, more detailed naval representations, etc.) and enjoy mountains of layers of complexity and a legal scholar's worth of rules will not be satisfied. However, those of us who just want to enjoy a fun evening or afternoon of Civil War-themed gaming can do so, and you can even teach this game to non-wargamers who will enjoy the experience. 

Also, the optional and Advanced rules are presented in an a la carte fashion, which allows you to encumber the experience with additional layers of complexity and realism that won't overly bog down the experience. Easily one of my top 10 favorite wargames of all time, and my favorite ACW themed experience.

A nice balance between complexity and playability. Shares the historical but still problematic feature of most ACW strategic games in that if the South is to win, it will be by early knock-out, whereas if the North will win, it will come only at the end of a long, grinding game of attrition. After owning several versions of this game I find I like the clean presentation and minimal rules of the original GDW version the best.

A great game on the ACW, if you want simple rules, but deep strategy.  Sometimes has an almost checkers-like feel to it.  Can be lots of fun if you play correctly.  I've probably rated it too low because I have won twice within a year as the Confederates.

Played a partial game of the basic rules to learn the game. Seemed ok but often just came down to lots of repeated dice rolling in the battles. Maybe the advanced rules will add more but I think I would need to play the basic game a few more times first and I just don't know if I'd be willing to devote that much time to it.

Dice rolling decides this game.  Very few mechanics (in the basic game) make for a rather dull dicefest.  Some strategy, but what little there is seems quite obvious.  Confederates: stack Richmond 50 stories high with Crack troops, and watch the Union batter themselves to death on your walls.  Union: Don't let the confederates do the above!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A fairly interesting game that is let down by the heavy emphasis on dice rolls.  Combat is very unsatisfactory; a Confederate attack on Washington leads to round after round of dice throwing, as the two sides slowly wear each other down; there is very little skill required, just lots of dice rolls.  The rest of the game is interesting.  On each turn it is unlikely that you will be able to do everthing you want, leading to trade-offs and interesting decision making.  But again, the number of moves you can make each turn it dtermined by a dice roll.  Perhaps the optional Command rules will help?

Very accessible civil war game that still gives a decent feel of the conflict. There's plenty of ahistorical play possible, so if that's what you're after I'd keep away. Greatly improved by using the advanced rules which add supply, stops the giant Union stacks rolling through the Confederacy. Confederate strategy feels a bit dominated by cavalry sometimes. I like that the placement of spaces on the map creates some really key points, and a Union controlled Mississippi feels like it really does hamper the Confederacy a lot. The command/battle round advanced rules feel a bit superfluous, our fights rarely seem to be large enough to be hampered by a lack of command. Maybe we are playing wrong.

Okay: Strategic - Civil War - Easy 

Great in strategy but far too abstract for my tastes. 

My biggest gripes:
-Too abstract for my tastes
-Theme and the historic event are miles apart. 
-Main issue is the combat system which I think is a bit frustrating; many crucial roles whereyou only role 1,2 or 3 dice and it is very suspective of luck on each crucial role.
-Not evocative

On the positive side: it is a daunting task to make a civil wargame and the streamlined design Frank Chadwick made does work and is accessible and playable!

I picked up a new copy for 10 Euro's and am actually more positive than I thought I would be: it is simple yet agonizing decions have to be made. 

Not for the Civil War buff however it is a decent  introduction game to wargame newbees but luck plays a BIG role. Although the system plays fast, it takes a long time to play out the whole war and with the abstract system this long play is not rewarding. 

If I want a longer game I play The Civil War as this system is far more work yet very rewarding.

A true ground-breaking classic, now better than ever with the superb graphics of the Phalanx edition. Play the American Civil War after reading only a few pages of easy-to-understand rules.

Entire war can take some time to play, but short one-year scenarios allow for quick games.

A vintage wargame with such a variety of optional rules that you have to start by agreeing which rules you're going to play. Using Basic Rules only, the Confederacy isn't going to win. They start with a smaller army yet can only win by going on the offensive. Adding Command Table and Supply rules seems a sensible way to balance the game without a massive overhead. It can be an unexciting game as the Confederacy can only win on 'army max' or just by frustrating the Union. As this is no more complicated than a block wargame, my central complaint is that this is far too long for what's on offer. 2 hours per year is a sensible expectation, far too much for a fundamentally simple system.

In my opinion, the greatest wargame ever made.  The fastest playing and most realistic simulation of the American Civil War available.  Lots of fun, amazingly realistic for its level of detail, truly Frank Chadwick's classic.  A very innovative system for its time.  While this game's timeless popularity speaks for itself, it is surprising how few other games have used this system.  (And this is the only game which uses the system this successfully.)  The basic system is point-to-point map, roll-to-hit combat, two hits to destroy a unit (so it's less random than one-strike-and-you're-out games like Axis & Allies).  Each side gets a random number of maximum moves each turn, which forces players to make priorities and enhances solitaire play.  The supply rules, which don't quite work right, are the only blemish on an otherwise perfect game.

RATING: 6
First play of the GDW first edition. With relatively simple rules and sound underlying mechanics, I can see the potential in this system, though the game itself does not match that potential. The game rewards careful thought, but ultimately the outcome can depend more on luck. There are times of tension and drama but long periods where little happens. All in all, the game provides some challenge and some fun but it is too long for what if offers. A minor classic that needs a serious reboot in order to compete with more modern low-complexity wargames that deliver as much of a game in half the time.

RATING: 5
It’s an “intro level” type game on the whole war at the strategic level, so it’s pretty basic even with the “advanced” rules. Counters are fun (good quality, I have the phalanx version). A bit long however considering how basic the game-play is, and what it entails. Also, for me it lacked something in the way of historical connection.

RATING: 6.5
While I think that this is a good introductory wargame that is a good next step after Risk, it just doesn't seem to provide the same number of enjoyable options or decisions of the CDGs or most block games.  I would definitely recommend one of the shorter scenario setups in the book (at least they were in the GDW 2nd edition book) which play only a year or two of the whole war.  Playing the whole war, the game drags a bit and seems a bit long for what it is.  The combat system is simple but tedious using not bucket of dice or a CRT.  Instead you must make most numerous dice rolls separately because of the way each unit must target another specific unit.  (Having different color dice and a decent memory helps a bit here in order to roll multiple attackers/defenders at once).Traded for 10/05

RATING: 7.3
I'm not a big time wargamer but this was a very good game.  The box says 60 minutes but there's no way, it took about 3 hours or more as we went the full 40 turns. It seemed like an easy win for the North by the half-way point in my first game, I almost conceded. But then I realized the value of a 3(-1) veteran who's entrenched! They lasted though turn 40, 4 vets in Atlanta.

A simple introductory wargame. I feel like it would be a great gateway game to wargaming. With the advanced (and more historical) rules, it seems to follow the expected trajectory of the Civil War. In my opinion, I feel like this is a great feature.

I'm not sure that this would satisfy a diehard wargamer but for those of us who occasionally want to wargame, it's a good selection.

It runs long (even some of the scenarios) and it can be hard to keep track of everything that is going on (leading to slow play).

Haven't played it much, but have enjoyed it on those occasions when I have. Point-to-point strategic wargame system, so can be thought of as an indirect ancestor of WTP/Hannibal.

Quite old game now, but keeps being re-released.

To be fair, I'm not really a fan of strategic level Civil War games. They seem to encourage turtle-ing behavior. Also, many games at this level try to model the Union's early lack of initiative by providing them with fewer action points.  This seems historically accurate, but drives me crazy as a player. Also, dice, lot and lots of dice.  It felt like luck (or lack of it) had a disproportionate effect in "A House Divided".  If I want to deal with dice, I'd rather play "Titan".

The basic game is a lot of fun.  The Union player seems to have an advantage.  The advanced rules seem to swing the balance in favor of the Confederates.  Also seemed to make the game less fun and more work.  The command tables just make each turn a little more predictable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is just a bit too abstract for me.  A simple game for a kick-back afternoon, but not much of a historical simulation.  The combat system belongs in fantasy gaming.  The Union should win as long as he keeps Washington D.C. safe.

RATING: 7.5
[2006.Dec.14] The 3rd edition of this game, published by Phalanx Games, easily outclasses any of the previous editions of the game. With a not too complicated ruleset, this American Civil War-themed wargame is an excellent choice for first-time wargamers. That said, the simplicity of the system makes it equally attractive to veteran grognards who are looking to take a break from their other more complex games.

[2007.May.10] Note that Phalanx Games' solution to the 3rd edition's game board-related corrigenda is unique, simple, and easy-to-implement. (For those who do not know, Phalanx Games provided two board-matching stickers that can be applied directly to the game board in order to correct the misprinted cities: Atlanta and New Orleans.) I wish more game publishers made this kind of effort to keep their products error free. Kudos to Phalanx Games!

This game is one of my all-time favorites, and it's a great introductory game, the quintissential "easy to learn/hard to master" wargame. And as far as strategic-level ACW, this is the only game in town at its complexity level. I find it captures the flavor and spirit of the conflict wonderfully, and it rewards historically accurate grand strategy; the Confederates need to strike early and aggressively to win or, failing that, fight a smart, economical delaying campaign, while the Anaconda plan works for the Union player as he or she builds up overwhelming force and allows time for command and infrastructure to develop (modeled in the advanced rules' march table). The only downside for me is the potentially long playing time.

I don't really desire to play this game again even though I recognize gameplay would go much faster the next time around.  The battles are too static with little variation and it feels like too much lather, rinse, repeat...over and over again.  This may well represent the mode of battle in this timeperiod, but I did not find it to make for exciting or dynamic game play.  Quite a bit is left to the whim of chance in dice rolling with some opportunity to modify the dice rolling.  Or, perhaps most wargames just aren't my style.  Who knows?

A point-to-point movement on the strategic American Civil War.  This game has put the war history into the right focus and perspective, allowing both players to explore all the real options facing the two sides' commanders.

One of my all-time favorite wargames.  I've played this one many times over many years and always enjoy the tension and strategic options.  It has streamlined rules--even with advanced and optional rules--that allow the players to focus on strategy and maneuver, rather than the rules and exceptions to the rules.  There is enough detail to capture the essence of what was interesting about the US Civil War and yet allowing for plenty of "what-if's".  Every time I read a book on the Civil War, I want to break this out.

The early war is an incredible balancing act with the Confederates trying to break through the Union lines and take enough cities to score a sudden death.   The Union player has to play a careful balancing act for a good chunk of the game before being able to go on the offensive.  The end game often results in a turtle-situation with the remaining Confederate army bunkered in Richmond/Petersburg.  I've yet to see a Confederate player hold out until the end of the war, though, it's been close.

Haven't had a chance to try it yet. Really looking forward to this one...

EDIT: Played twice, lost both games early as the union. This game looks simple, but there's a lot to think about. I might even call it a bit of brain-burner.

I don't like that there are so many optional rules. I like games to have a definitive version; all the optional rules which can be added or subtracted at your leisure makes me feel like I have to play the tinkerer and fine tune the game myself. 

That said: I used the supply, leaders, and command  rules. This game is TOUGH on the union player, let me tell ya! Looking forward to trying it again.

Good game but they really should have sorted out the rules themselves instead of giving you a menu of basic, advanced and options rules which youre ment to combine to make your own game. I suspect the sweet spot for me would be using the basic rules and around half the advanced ones. The command chart and supply are good. Advanced combat is a tedious dicefest. Leaders are also tedious.

Interesting light-wargame with enough optional rules and scenarios implemented to ensure replayability. There remains a risk for scripted nature due to the (logical) standard setup for the basic game, but the random movement rolls make up for it, whilst this may be a too big luck factor - movement is everything in the game. Otherwise the game offers plenty of nice ideas woven into it, which are simple but work well both thematically and mechanically. Increased plays should unveil whether, (amongst experienced players) or not this game devolves into a contest of digging trenches (South) versus finding a way around this (North) which can be a drag.
The printing errors (Phalanx 3rd ed.) on the map are unforgivable, if easily fixed through the publisher.

A simple enough and reasonably entertaining wargame that can be learned quickly and enjoyed in an evening (basic game.)

I'm not a Civil War buff, and thus this game probably couldn't rise to the status of favorite, or even well-loved. But it's got a lot going for it, not the least of which that it appears to be both accessible and reasonably deep.

The Washington/Richmond area gets a little congested, and progress there appears to depend more on blunders by one opponent than especially great play by the other. But it seems like there are a lot of possible strategies to try. The game seems to mirror the basic Civil War situation fairly accurately in a big picture sense. So it "feels" like a Civil War game while you're playing. And I think that's a very good thing.

I probably wouldn't ask to play this, but I did enjoy playing it and would do it again on occasion.

Pretty tense game, with lots of back-and-forth.  Thought I was going to be decimated as the South, seeing my numerical inferiority, but North never able to bring all its forces to bear, and I harassed him enough to keep him on the back foot.  Some tense moments, with some real momentum sway.

Seems a bit... dry.

Tried the basic rules with a short solo play. Seemed more of an abstract to me than anything else. The strange way of limiting cavalry is... limited (and strange).

Would need many opposed plays to see if this is actually good. The abstract nature brings an importance of particular local moves that is a bit annoying for soloing, a least for me (hard to out-think myself).

Phalanx edition.  Very nicely produced, except for the towering leader units.  Wished they were simply produced as standard counters.  Otherwise, rules are identical  to the 2nd edition by GDW.

-------------------------------------------------------

Elegant strategic ACW game and one of my favourite wargames.  Own both the Phalanx and the GDW puzzle board edition.

Very playable, low complexity and for such a playable game (about as complex as some of the mid-level Columbia Games block games), captures the "feel" of the war surprisingly well.  

The one drawback for some may be the long playing time if the game goes the distance (2 sessions maybe 6+ hrs), but as in many wargames, the winner can often be determined much sooner.

I by no means are a specialist on the American Civil War. But as an exception this is one heck of an excellent game to learn & play & to keep in my personal collection. I love playing this game for many reasons.  The game comes with superb playing pieces, nice mapboard with good graphics & the general packaging of this game is excellent. I love this game, because I do not get bogged down with too much complexity from the rule book. This maybe a simple generalisation of the whole Civil War, but it is worth in many respects to play this. I can't see this game ever walking out of my personal gaming collection at all.  This is an excellent game also for the novice player at an introductory level & also a perfect gift for anybody into Civil War era.

There were a few things I didn't like about this game.  First, it seems kind of dicey.  Second, it seems somewhat restrictive in that you have to open play a certain way (ie, as the Confederates you pretty much have to build up your cavalry and then use them to raid the Union).  This may be historical, but I like games that give you a little more of a "what if?".  Of course I am not an expert on Civil War history so maybe there is no "what if?" here and that really was the only option open to the Confederates.

Anyway, on the plus side I can see this playing pretty quickly and being somewhat interesting to fans of the period, but it didn't convert me into a ACW fan. It's a clever design in any event.

I bought this when it first came out back in 1981 to play with a friend who was "wargame challenged". He liked it and I was surprised to find that I did also. I had expected to be turned off by the abstraction. But when my friend passed away I never played it again. Sold it in 1988.

When my wife recently began gaming I remembered it and picked up a 2nd ed. copy. We have played it several times and she has really enjoyed the game. 

A great introductory game and a lot of fun. No, it is not a history lesson but it does convey a 'feel' for the war and some of the problems the combatants faced.

I really wanted to like this game. The rules are simple and intuitive, the gameplay flows nicely,there are differing styles of play for both sides and I really like the unit progression and drafting system - all seems very good. However, the victory conditions are a bit of a let down, as it seems the game will either be a quick victory for the South or a long and very tiresome and boring slog for the North. The stacking limits are also a bit of a problem. I have only played the first edition basic rules straight out of the box, so subsquent editions and optional rules might make for a more dynamic experience.

How can you go wrong with a game that's been around this long? Fairly simple rules, easy battle resolution, logical game flow. I've gotten my wife to play this game...

RATING: 6
Can be over in 1 hour, or in 4. Can be repetitive if the game runs too long. If you are playing the South, long games are problematic because the balance of power seems to inexorably shift to the Union- which is pretty understandable, but limits the game. Short games tend to go to the Rebels, and can be equally unsatisfying.

RATING: 7.5
My rating of 7.5 (November 2012) for the then-new  Mayfair edition, which features a colorful mounted mapboard and thick, finished counters. 

In this edition, the full rulebook is 32 pages long, but it's a 6 1/2" x 9 1/2" format, plus the base rules sections cover only 11 pages and are amply illustrated. Optional and advanced/optional rules are covered between pages 17-28. There's also a 4-page base rules handout, and CSA and USA Display Sheets. 

It's a nice, simple design that offers lots of strategic and tactical choices, but one that doesn't get bogged down in charts and record-keeping. With a maximum of 40 turns to play a complete game, however, that can be somewhat off-putting, but each side has set victory conditions which it may reach well before 40 turns are played. 

Also, one quickly realizes that many of the first several turns (representing the first year or so of the war) reflect the fact that neither side was particularly well prepared or organized and had to take time to recruit and put troops into place in order to carry out strategies. Therefore, many of the early rounds should go fairly quickly as one realizes that even if one wins a battle, holding that ground plus one's starting location is going to be extremely tenuous. 

But at least with the base rules, this is one of those games in which you can quickly get into game play, have to think through all moves, and yet can concentrate on game play rather than rules details. Designer Frank Chadwick is very clever that way.

RATING: 6
while it is an entry war game, for me the (basic) rules were still a lot to digest and only after some reading of 2 hours or so my gaming buddy and me got into the flow of the game.

When playing this game, my opponent and me where kinda lost as to what strategies to deploy and it seems like this game wants you to play it several times in order to appreciate the design.

Problem is, I have other games I want to play and didn't try yet and a lot of games I allready played but will chose over this when deciding for a game to play with a friend because they are more or less guaranteed fun while this game feels more like work. It is not that this game wasn't fun, IT WAS! But I'm not sure if it's woth investing time to master it when there are so many other good deep games out there that accomplish the same with less rules headaches.

And if I wanted to into wargaming as a hobby, I might as well chose Advanced Squad Leader etc. in the first place.

RATING: 7
A caveat that I've only played the short game with the basic rules, but this came over as good gateway game into the point-to-point wargame world. With a roll to see how many moves you make, and a roll at the end of the turn to see how many recruits you can bring on, you're somewhat at the mercy of the dice gods, so the game can't be taken too seriously. But it can be taken as it is for a decent swash of fun, accepting the fates as they come and doing the best you can. Within those fate constraints there's many good and bad decisions to be made that can importantly help decide the game - when to push, where to aggregate, where to defend. I used it as an introduction to point-to-point for my son, and apart from some (unneeded?) wibbles with cavalry and jump moves, the rules are easy and the combat is pleasantly simple yet engaging, with cheer/groan factor as the combat rounds progress. The game shows off how important retreat options are and how dangerous it can be to push too far on what appears to be a relatively empty map - ie strategy - and to that end, it's served its purpose admirably.

Wonderfully elegant design, almost chess-like calculation involved for piece movement. Seems balanced, but not symmetrical. Downsides: big battles can be tedious and games can be anti-climactic.

En las tres partidas jugadas ha ganado la Confederación, esta parece tenerlo algo mas sencillo al principio, en ninguna de las tres partidas se ha llegado a Abril de 1962 momento en que se ve reforzada la Union y podria equilibrar algo mas el juego. Esta por ver....

Que equivocado estaba, las tres anteriores partidas las jugue como confederado y las gane las tres por eso me daba esa sensacion de ventaja sobre la Union pero la cuarta partida la he jugado como la Union y la victoria ha sido igual de clara, eso si hemos llegado a julio de 1863. por lo tanto retiro lo dicho anteriormente. El miedo que me da es que mi compañero de juegos le entre el desanimo con este juego y acabe no queriendo volver a jugar.

Quinta partida y primera ganada por mi compañero de juegos, yo he jugado con la union y el con los confederados y me ha ganado por llegar al final del track de tiempo, bueno me he rendido 4 o 5 turnos antes porque empezo a jugar al gato y el raton moviendose por el mapa y no me daba tiempo a pillarle.

Great classic game. Easy system to learn, not as easy to master. Try to use advanced rules to feel the whole flavour. Maybe not for die hard wargamers. Just a drawback, is too much die rolling, I recommend using several colored dices to save dice tosses. If you plan to buy this title and you are concerned about component quality then purchase Phalanx version, if you are budget limited and do not mind about quality, grab a GDW copy on Ebay for a few bucks. Finally, last rules version are online.

I've only played incomplete games, probably less than 20 turns. I've also only played with the basic rules. I'm interested in getting some more play time with this game.

"The supply rules are definitely a must-have. The other rules are mostly pretty good, in my opinion, but none are as important as supply.

Bought 3rd edition recently after finding and buying a 2nd ed at a yard sale without any pieces. That reminded how much I played this game in the previous century. Every gamer I know now used to play it and loves the quality of the new components* and the game itself. *But does anybody else get a weird optical illusion effect under certain flourescent lighting with the darker diagonal shading used on the map especially in the South? Also a minor beef, the artist put 18 stripe on the American Flag. I don't know why it pisses me off but it does.

 Axis and Allies might be the better rated game from 1981, but when it comes to accessible, operational level war games this is my game of choice. I love how incredibly accessible this game is. I like how this delivers the historical flavor of the war, but the rules are not so tight that it only produces an exact simulation of the actual event. Obviously, the battle of of Philadelphia did not happen but when war games allow for ahistorical events to occur I really like that. Of course, we only played with the base rules. I am sure the optional rules add extra historical chrome, and I would be fine with that as well. Giving the players the framework to craft the game to their liking is a huge strength for me.

RATING: 7
Bought at Essen 2008 (German version)

Edit 02 june 2009

I updated the rating from a 7 to an 8 today in order to reflect my drastically improved appreciation of this game as a SOLITAIRY playable game. After reading several encouragements in the forum about solitaire play I decided to try myself. And indeed, given certain restrictions, the game plays out wonderfully when played by just you alone. The key to this success is of course in large part because of the use of dice and the open nature of the game. Dice make up the number of moves one can play, dice make up the number of recruits you can have and of course dice decide on the outcome of battle. Therefore what would be a Strategic game, mixed with a large amount of Tactical play, is essentially turned around into an enjoyable Tactical game, with some Strategic elements. Playing it solitaire means no surprises are possible, unless you deliberately make one for ‘the other side’, but trying to optimize what is randomly given to you in it self is a challenge worth undertaking. Make sure you pick this one up if you’re looking for a good, playable, tactical solitaire wargame.

RATING: 10
[18 plays] 

What I like :

*Theme, I read as much about the Civil War as time allows.
*Beautiful artwork.
*Terrific mapboard to analyze and strategerize over.
*Solid, light level historical simulation.
*Streamlined and clear ruleset.
*Straightforward turn sequence.
*FUN, FUN, FUN.

Slight drawbacks: 
*Towards my upper limit of dice dependence.
*Counter stacks and map crowding (not terrible, but it is fairly easy to miss things if you aren't careful.)

Please note: This could be a very depressing game for the CSA player if they walk into it without full awareness of just how dire the first years can be. The CSA player needs to have a good attitude about the nature of the beast and realize that this is not a fair fight - hence the different victory conditions. Don't worry beyond reason about losing Fredricksburg or even Richmond. It is the USA player that needs to worry about DC. 

Please note: The USA player needs to be aware of how easily he can lose Washington if he gets too aggressive or momentarily inattentive to the potential situation in the East. Neither player is wise to launch all or nothing battles too early in the game - you could get lucky, but more often you will cripple yourself.

RATING: 7.5
2/2013: Updated rating from 6.5 to 7.5. In the midst of a full 3.1 game. Advanced rules for combat, routed units, and desertion really make the game much more satisfying. The advanced rules, in general, deliver. They are intuitive, historical, and add strategic depth -- all w/ very minimal chrome overhead.

I can see why this game has survived and is continually picked up by new publishers. I ultimately picked up the Phalanx version as it has the best components. I waited too long and paid the OOP mark-up. The current printing from Mayfair is fine, but a notch lower on components. 

I've always wanted to play out a historical grand-strategic game like this in real-time. I tried it once with Fire in the Sky, but the rules overhead made it impossible (ie, having to repeatedly re-read the rulebook). 

The rules-scalability of AHD, however, invites another try at real-time game turns.

I can't help play this game while narrating it as a Southern soldier writing a letter to his family back home (a la Ken Burns' Civil War).

7/2010: Early initial rating. Playing VASSAL module. Would like to have the 2nd edition version to avoid the slanted lines of the current map. Good rule-check-to-enjoyment ratio.

Simple and delightful large scale ACW game.  I play with all the bells and whistles but for the morale checks and the battle clock depicting the time and days.

There can be some problems with endless rolling where someone needs to roll a hit for the battle to end but can't.  Other than that, the game stands up to the test of time.

This game is grossly undervalued by the BGG community. A simple set of rules (which can be added on to with lots of extra chrome rules) allows for a fun replaying of the Civil War. Not exactly realistic, but playable in 2 hours, which is pretty good for a 4 year war.

RATING: 6
Shiny thick unit counters and markers, on par with Phalanx's Age of Napoleon. Basic rules are short and easy to comprehend, making getting started a breeze.
Lots of advanced and optional rules that can be phased in to play or ignored as you see fit.

Combat rules are simple, perhaps too much so for those used to heavier wargames.

Would rate the components a 9, downgrading because the mounted map is a bit hard too read, and could be a fair bit bigger to accomodate the units easier. Also, the map isn't all that geographically accurate, as several cities have been "moved" dozens of miles, seemingly to make the point-to-point movement less cramped in some places (?)

Will rate after playing more
Update:After 2 plays and 2 crushing Union wins, not really liking the system. Basic game is too simple and lasts too long to hold interest; adding advanced rules doesn't really change the outcome in my opinion.

I play virtually only euros, and this was the first genuine wargame I played. I can see the appeal of the genre if you're into the period of simulation. I doubt whether it's my type of game. Even in this relatively light wargame, the rules distracted too much from actual gameplay for me. I guess I should steer clear of Hannibal and the like.

RATING: 6.5
My rating probably reflects my ambivalence towards Civil War titles generally; I usually find games on other periods more interesting. Still, A House Divided makes a good entry point for learning wargames, particularly for those with a real interest in that period. For those with the time to absorb a large rulebook and play a longer game, I recommend The Civil War from Victory.

1 go at the full campaign game with the Phalanx games edition.  Rules are fairly straight forward and it didn't take long to get into the mechanics of it.

Holds up well for an older game system.

For a simple nodal strategic wargame, this provides me with the adequate overview of the ACW that I want to play out. And it's simple enough that if I want to adapt it to include any 'what if's' - it wouldn't break the basic games to do so. Lots of plays of this old-timer way back years ago.

Recently purchased Phalanx/3rd Edition.  Superb components.  Reasonably clearcut rules.  Brought my 12 year old up to speed with the Basic Rules for our first play through, next day added in Advanced Rules, and he wants to use all the optionals for our next play through.  Optional/Advanced do add to the wristage, but the game still plays well and fun with the basic rules sets.  Can be a reasonable history/ACW teacher.  My boy picked up on the Union Victory Conditions right away and went after them mercilessly, and gave a good account for a rookie gamer.

This game has opened me up to the world of war gaming, and led me on to trying some heavier war games. While I'm as of yet to say I like the heavier ones, A House Divided at least is amazing. The player interaction, the very different ways the Confederates and Union functions, the depth of strategy and the I particularly like the very thematic advanced combat system (even though still dice driven and somewhat random). Oh, and the recruiting. Not sure why, but I really like the recruitment system, as your pool of recruits slowly grows as other units die or are promoted, leading to a slowly evolving board of troops where some are more experienced than others. The victory track also reminds me of Twilight Struggle, with that 'back and forth' struggle that creates good tension as you need to keep your enemy from making too many advances. I love playing as the Union, but also look forward to eventually playing as the Confederates.

Actual game play is probably a &#039;7&#039;or &#039;8,&#039; but I&#039;m still hopeful that one day I&#039;ll find the perfect cocktail of advanced and optional rules that put this one over the top.

A clean, quick, fun, but very simplified, strategic take on the Civil War.

Unfortunately, the various editions over the years have muddied the waters with so many optional rules, basic and advanced versions, etc. that it's hard to agree on what rules to play, making it very hard to hit the table.

Too many designers, developers, and publishers have spoiled an otherwise fine game.

Mr. Chadwick's games, or at least those of which I am familiar, are almost Euro-y in their elegance, symmetries, and simplicity, and this is very true of this game, particularly the way promotions and recruitments work.

RATING: 9.5
Terrific game that captures the most important strategic considerations of the Civil War with very simple and playable rules. AHD doesn't strive for extreme historical accuracy, but it gets close enough IMO and includes a plethora of optional rules to cover any weaknesses deemed particularly offensive historically. Gameplay is delightfully tense throughout, as both sides struggle to address competing needs with limited resources. A variety of strategic options are plausible for each side, each with their own challenges and rewards.

My only reservation about the game is that the huge variety of basic, optional, and advanced rules is difficult to navigate. Without some experience, it's hard to predict which rulesets will create a balanced game - I understand this was addressed somewhat in 4th edition. Personally, I recommend using only Supply and the Command Table from the Advanced Rules and the Combat Experience optional - those three rules add almost no overhead, but do a lot to nudge the narrative towards a historically plausible result. 

The game also runs rather long (usually 4+ hours) unless the Confederates win a breakout victory early on. But it's hard to see how the game could be any shorter and still capture the epic grind of the war as it dragged on.

Very highly recommended for players of any experience level who are interested in the ACW.

RATING: 7.5
Not counting war-themed Euros like Shogun or fantastical multiplayer AT titles like Nexus Ops and Titan, AHD was my first honest-to-goodness wargame after the near-perfect chimera that is Twilight Struggle.  

By and large, it's a good game.  It's not nearly as awesome as TS is, due to being both blander and longer, and also because I just don't find the Civil War as interesting, but it still manages a good deal of dice-tempered strategic depth and strong asymmetric play (the two great advantages of this genre over the Euros I typically play).  And I suspect it might be better balanced.  I'm never going to get into it a fraction as much as TS, but at the very least I *must* play it again from the Confederates' side.

I am not a big Civil War fan but the mechanics are interesting. After a couple of short plays, we changed the turn sequence slightly for a full game attempt (North and South recruit simultaneously) to make it more fair to the South and this seemed to work. Game took longer to get through than advertised - newbies may expect to take 3-4 hours to finish. Clearly the advanced rules would make the game more interesting as well.

The component design is unfriendly to those new to the game.  The little cardboard army markers are stacked in a way as to cover important info on the gameboard (which is less of a problem if one knows the board really well).  The cardboard armies are also stacked on each other so that during the game the players keep having to rifle through the little stacks to evaluate them.  My rating of this game may improve with further play and greater familiarity with the map, but it is an extremely fiddly game.  Perhaps I'm just not used to traditional-style war games.

RATING: 6
A creaky, possibly arthritic wargame from a time long past.  But at $24 (Mayfair 4th ed) this was a shot in the dark that I couldn't pass up.

With a few games behind me, it appears that A House Divided traces its group activations and combat mechanics back to oldies/goodies such as Napoleon: 1815 (1974) and War at Sea (1976).  Its more appealing inventions (e.g., promotions) likely influenced designs as recent as Hearts & Minds (2010).

My major grumble is that the game will always run too long, regardless of the variant or optional rules selected.  Many options even add to the playtime, which is a terrible idea.  AHD wants to be 25 turns max, but can go as long as 40. There are many other games that I'd rather play with 4-5 spare hours, and the diehards who advocate "just play faster" are screaming into the wind. 

The base game is quite simple, though, and could be a decent grognardian intro for teens with too much free time.  Which, as far as I can tell, is all of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
We played using all the basic optional rules (except extended game and help for the novice Union player (although maybe I needed it)), all the advanced rules, and none of the advanced optional rules other than Confederate coastal defenses.  The game is very playable in that configuration and does a great job as a simulation.  The two sides play differently, and it looks like winning will take both more strategic thought and greater understanding of the situation than I've brought to the game so far. You really need to plan your campaigns, and the supply rules make careful deployment a necessity.  I think I'm going to need to be much more patient to play this game well and not get tempted into attacking before I'm ready. 

An excellent, playable, evocative game.

Based on one play using just the Basic Rules. A very playable, entry level wargame. Time flew by and we had a blast, except for a monumental slugfest at the end which determined the winner... But everything leading up to that was a lot of fun -- wonderful components, neat promotion system, tough choices and several different approaches to take. Can't wait to try again with some of the advanced rules to introduce supply attrition and leaders. I can see this getting a lot of play, and going more quickly, with familiarity. Probably has the potential to be 8.5/10 material.

Wargame sencillo sobre la guerra civil estadounidense. No está mal, pero se hace un poco monótono y se alarga a partir de mitad de la partida. Para mi gusto, el gran fallo es que no haya límites de apilamiento.

Better than expected from an older light wargame.  Plays fast.  Most of the optional and advanced rules enhance play although they slow combat down a bit.

Good introductory wargame, and an excellent wargame in general. The bewildering array of optional and advanced rules is a blessing and a curse. Plays VERY differently depending on the combination of optional/advanced rules used. I recommend using the "CSA victory delayed" rule, requiring the CSA win condition to be checked at the end of the USA turn, rather than being sudden death. This discourages the CSA cavalry raiding strategy that can be frustrating and doesn't feel very historical. Games tend to be very short, or very long...

Great strategic view of ACW but playable in an evening rather that multiple sessions.

I had the GDW version, which doesn't look great. Simple, strong system though. Very nice game.

Not played the advanced game. To much luck in the beginning game. Roll the dice for movement. Roll the dice for fighting. Roll the dice for reforcement.

having played 7-8 games of this i have to say it is a very rewarding,balanced experience, and for the price range and relatively simple concepts its a keeper, it is a very simple but deep game that i love.

Cool, but looooong for what it is. After the initial brutal head-ramming, came down to lots of little cat and mouse fiddling that take forever, and give little sense of how it'll turn out if you quit early.

Nice light wargame. Lots of rules to make it from ultra light to medium  weight wargame. Nice mechanics somehow convey the  ACW feel. I'm impressed.

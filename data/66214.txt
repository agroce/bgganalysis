For me, the similar feel with Chicago Express was a turnoff. It's not bad... it's just that it's not great -- nor is the game play inspiring to me, as is the case with so many other games.

This will see more table time, but these are the first impressions I have.

I can't see any redeeming value to this game whatsoever, so remain baffled at the occasional praise this game receives. The theme is actually somewhat interesting, but the watered down stock mechanic plus route building just doesn't feel smart nor interesting. I'm lost as to the strategies - with such obvious decisions, it felt far too easy to win. Not going to play this again.

An introduction to Winsome games for beginning gamers. A different kind of gateway, opening into a different direction.

[u]Provisional rating based on a solo-play rules shakedown[/u]: This game may be too much for what it tries to do. There are too many ways to score -- cash, cards, connections, goods -- and I think that's going to induce AP and hand-wringing. I suspect it will play better with more than two, although, having just played CE, I think that game provides a clearer, more direct path to victory -- end up with more cash (the only currency in play) than anyone else -- with no more rules complexity. Queen may have overreached with this one in attempting to make it more "family friendly" -- it seems like too many sharp edges were removed.  Makes me worry about the other Winsome adaptations, as well.

Pseudo-Eisenbahn-Spiel, welches sich schnell spielt und wirklich schönes Material hat. Ein wenig mehr Einflussnahme auf "Aktienpreise" (Heiratskosten) oder die "Aufträge" (Warenkarten) wäre schön.
Vielleicht mit der Erweiterung?

Samarkand has got incredibly simple rules that mish mash some light stock holding/investing and random destination card draws. I like the feel of the decision making--but I'm not sure how strategically meaningful your decisions really are. It's at least a good intro to route building/stock holding games.

RATING: 6.9
Re-skinned and slimmed down train game, specifically Chicago Express-like. Okay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Samarkand is a simplified network and share game.  It's most radical simplification is to dispense with share auctions; here each trading company has just two and you acquire one by paying a fixed price to the company. Monopoly ownership is banned, so you may wind up sharing the company with an opponent.  As a share owner you can extend the company's trading network and spend its treasury to do that faster.  

Cards representing commodities at specific locations on the board bring a fair chunk of luck. Sometimes you will draw cards that work well with your existing holdings and other times you won't.  While poor cards can be discarded,  you will be losing ground to those who draw better.  That would bother me more were there not other useful things to do in this game. In a way that is slightly reminiscent of Stephenson's Rocket, there are significant rewards in money and vps for joining networks.  Rather like TransAmerica, being left alone to develop a network in an isolated part of the board is not a good thing.  In more crowded parts of the board, the two camel limit in each area can put a real crimp on your network's capacity to connect with others.  Having said that, it does strike me as a less cut-throat game than Chicago Express.  

Production quality and artwork are up to Queen's usual standards.  The English rules are brief and clearly written.

Generally found it to be like an inoffensive, more family-friendly, and less sensitive Chicago Express.  The art and theme didn't do much for me, and I didn't feel like there was a lot of opportunity for clever play.  Could be a gem for train-type lovers whose games of choice aren't hitting the casual table as often as they would hope.  For me, just OK.

RATING: 7
A simpler, lighter adaptation of the winsome cube train games. Plays fast (although with a fiddly setup), has simple rules, attractive components, fairly decent theme integration and should be a good family game. It also has a certain dose of randomness in the deck card, but there's more depth to it than is first apparent from what looks like an easy game. A good choice to get non- and heavy gamers at the same table.

A dobozból való setup meglehetősen hosszú. Egy befejezett játék esetén viszont teljesen elfogadható( sok elem a helyén marad végig a játék folyamán.

A játék mechanizmusa érdekes, tetszik a döntési lehetőség, hogy befektetsz (győzelmi ponttal) egy családba, ezzel rövid távon pontot vesztesz, de hosszú távon nyerhetsz a kapcsolatokkal. Ugyanez igaz a lapeladásoknál is.  a káryaeldobási döntések általában elég egyértelműek.
Elsőre furcsa az, hogy egy-egy játékos nagyon tudja gyorsítani a játékot, ezért az ember meglepődik, hogy nem tudja véghez vinni a tervét. ezt szokni kell a stratégia kidolgozásánál, de alapvetően pozitív.

Egy köteg pontozólap még elfért volna a dobozban.

Played a three player game. I liked the mechanics, but there was no tension in the game. I was able to do anything I wanted to. Although I pulled off the victory, I didn't feel that I had to try very hard to get it. I just caught on a turn before my fellow players. I'm assuming that this game plays better with 4 or 5. I'll have to try it again with more players.

2010. stk hldg, route bldg.  This route-building game is trickier than it first appears, primarily because of the limitations on hand side and drawing cards.  Additional depth and complexity is imparted from deciding when to sacrifice one of your 7 possible end game cards to get cash during the game.  Usually there are many good things that you *could* do but there's not enough time so you need to focus on the things that net you the biggest payoff.  To this end, I think it helps to consciously avoid giving too many points to the persons you perceive to be the leaders and/our your closest competitors.

camels, caravans, etc.  Based on OOP Winsome game called Age of Scheme.

John Bohrer says: we have transformed a no-luck gamer's game [Age of Scheme] into a German family game [Samarkand:R-to-R]. It has luck, it is shorter in length of play, it is re-sized for the usual German 2-5 players (as opposed to the US 3-6 players) and it has gorgeous Queen artwork.

I wish the numbered regions were somehow easier to find and the decisions about which cards to discard were faster.  But this game has plenty of depth and various strategies for earning VP.  You can be a driver of one family and focus on its growth, or you can invest in well managed families and ride their coattails.  There is a ton of cash=VP to earn in making new family connections...  The cards for the center of the board are absolutely the best cards in the deck... it is unfortunate if one player obtains the exclusive majority of those cards.

Samarkand for 2 might not be ideal - I wouldn't know, since I've never played with more.  I also haven't played Age of Scheme, so I can't really comment on how this game differs.  What I can say is that the game is a nice, fast little connection/route building game.  It has luck, and the mechanisms aren't particularly deep - the tension comes from timing and managing your money to be able to buy into the families you need to, while trying to conserve all your cards for higher VPs at the end of the game.  With 2, you can probably wrangle what you need to, and most of your city cards should have two of your camels in them by game's end.  If the game were longer, I'd give it a pass, but for the amount of game here the length is just right.  I would be interested to play with more, as it seems like a good way to introduce casual gamers to the cutthroat world of Winsome.

If Chicago Express is Monopoly then this is Monopoly Junior - pretty much the same game but shorter and simpler with better graphics and perhaps more fun as a consequence.  Having said that, it's much harder to make excess profits than it is in CE, mostly as a result of the limited number of shares in the camel trains. DiceCon West 2010.

I liked this more than I expected to. It takes the basic ideas in Chicago Express and other Winsome (and Wallace) games and puts them into a more appealing package than usual. There is some hidden information, so AP isn't completely out of hand. There is interesting player interaction. The rules and system are reasonably straightforward but produce somewhat nuanced tactics.

There is one balance that I think is off, though: "mergers" are too powerful and worth too many points. It becomes a matter of never opening up the opportunity to merge unless you will benefit substantially yourself. Otherwise, the benefits for the merging player are just too high.

Like most Winsome games - the ones that work anyway - this has a good structure, but as a game it lacks the final polishing to put it "over the top" and make it more than a disposable curiosity, albeit a reasonably interesting one. I'd play again, but have no urge to add it to my collection.

While I suspect the majority of the people that will play this will never have played Age of Scheme (the game this is based on), this is basically Age of Scheme with the economic teeth taken out of it to make it into a game to play with your family.  They did a great job of making this a very beautiful and accessible game!

The goods and goods cards help give people some direction on where they might want to focus their energies, and the game maintains the interesting shareholder payouts for mergers.  The game pacing is also important, as you try to evaluate how long is left in the game to get certain things done.

However, I really missed the heavy financial aspect of the original, and the cutthroatness it created.  Money in the family treasuries was a crucial aspect of the original, but is hardly something to consider in this version.  When you buy into a family, odds are it will be enough money to do nearly anything you wanted to do, which was the one real let down in this game that keeps it from getting a higher score from me.  It really removed a lot of tension that made Age of Scheme so great.  I just never felt like there were any painful decisions to make here.  There are definitely still choices to make, but it's generally trying to decide which actions are a priority rather than a painful choice about whether your decision will pay off or not.

Never the less, this is a great game to break out with the family, which is still interesting for gamers.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

I can see how some people would leave some people cold. For anyone who really needs that narrative arc (not talking about theme here) - to feel like they are [i]doing[/i] or [i]building[/i] something, this is probably going to be a miss. The game is just a bit too short to get emotionally invested in.

But, if you're looking for a quick and interesting opener/closer for your experienced group, then look no further - Samarakand is a fast game full of great little choices, that all feed into higher overall strategies.

In my experience, a lot of games that boast being simple to learn but still full of interesting strategy often have pretty clear rulesets, but very opaque strategies (see: Chicago Express). Often with these sorts of games I find myself floundering through my first game or two, making decisions at semi-random to see what happens and just generally feeling lost.

With Samarkand, not only did I understand the rules straight away but I had a pretty good idea of a strategy to pursue, too. But by the end of the game, I could see why so many of my decisions were poor ones. I actually came in second place, but our first game ended with a 10 minute discussion among the group about the VERY different sorts of choices we'll be making in future games.

This is one of those great rare games where right after the rules explanation, you feel like you fully understand everything and have a strategy to pursue. Then after your first game, you spend 10 minutes talking with the other players about how you will make VERY different choices next time.

Having only played it once so far, I can't personally guarantee this game has great longevity, but I will say that my gut is telling me it will withstand repeated plays well.

I can also see this making a good "next step" game for players looking to bridge that gap between true gateway games and more complex titles.

[i]Received this after winning the Queen Lancaster Games contest.[/i]

Rated 8 after one play. Man oh man, I'm really enjoying some of these family-weight Queen game titles. And, Samarkand is another route building, light stock game. Between Paris Connection, Samarkand, and Chicago Express, you've got three games in slightly increasing complexity that involve train (or camel) routes and some means for investing in each color.

Paris Connection is the simplest, and Samarkand adds a bit more complexity because you get a payout whenever two colors first collide on the board. But the basic choice is simple: 1) invest in a family or 2) plop one or two camels on the board. That's it. Also interesting is that there's really only two "shares" in each family. At most two players will control a single color, but both will be able to make decisions regarding camel placement, and that adds some nice tension.

I'm surprised at the interesting choices regarding where to take routes. I can see where some serious gamers might balk at the randomness of the cards, but then again, this is a family game first and foremost, with enough "meat on the bones" for more serious gamers.

In short, I'm very impressed. This is a solid title for that "Gateway plus" type game.

Update: I traded this away, only because I ended up concluding that Paris Connection and Chicago Express are the lighter stock games that will likely get the most play. I think this is a good game, but it was a little too complex for light gamers and I'd rather play Chicago Express with "serious" gamers. I'd still gladly play this anytime.

RATING: 8
(4/2/10- from posted review)"You don't buy any *fun* games anymore." So goes my wife's lament since I discovered Winsome games. Christmas 2008 brought me Chicago Express. Since then, more than half my gaming budget has been spent on little plastic clamshell cases with wooden cubes and glossy 11"x17" graphic design atrocities. Most onlookers at the pub where we have game night mistakenly think we doing chemistry homework. I was addicted to the opaque exercises in valuation and evaluation of gamestate, the game-end timing, the emergent alliances, the parasitism, the wildly uncontrollable system dynamics. There have been a rash of reprints recently, but one that I eagerly awaited was Age of Scheme: Routes to Riches. I heard it had been licensed - probably to Queen, the folks who redid the spartan Wabash Cannonball as the lush Chicago Express. Excitement ensued. Said excitement was dashed when I learned that the game would no longer be the brainbending, no-luck analytical exercise in funlessness that I'd read about. But... a new excitement grew. This new, totally different game sounded like a very interesting beast indeed: Winsome Lite: The Family Game. Something 'fun', perhaps?

So, first things first, I got myself a used copy of Age of Scheme. Then I put Samarkand - the new title for the new game - on my want list and wish list.

When Samarkand arrived, my wife looked at the art, the little wooden camels, the gobs of pretty cardboard. "This looks fun. How long does it take?"

"Forty-five minutes."

"Really?"

"That is what it says on the box."

One hour later, after rules explanation and our first game: "That *was* fun. I really liked it." And we've played it several times since, all with great success.

In Samarkand players buy into trading families and build the trading routes of those families. On your turn, you can choose to marry into a trading family and draw destination cards, or you can extend the route of a family you own. Up to two players can be married into (and thus control) each family. Up to two families can exist in a space. Points are scored by connecting your families' routes to other families' routes, reaching destinations indicated by your hand cards, and picking up chits that litter the board along the way. The game ends when either one family has connected to five others or when all ten families have connected to at least one other. This takes about 20-45 minutes.


While the bits are lovely and plentiful, the game takes a while to set up (some of this can be alleviated by just replacing the goods chits with cubes since the numbers don't mean anything for chit collection), particularly in relation to playtime. In some ways this works because once it is set up, people tend to want to play again right away, what with all the sunk set-up time costs. Almost every time I've played, it has been a double or triple-header.

The game has a lot of the things I love about Winsome cube rails games - game end timing management, incentive management, unscripted gameplay - but it takes the bite out. Take out the auctions (and the grueling valuation), add some luck and hidden information (the hand cards, which make up about 50% of endgame scores), and the decisions remain interesting but much more forgiving. The timing issues become less about calculation and manipulation of incentives and more about estimation of relative position. There are fewer wrong moves, but good moves are not obvious. All this said, the tapestry of ownership leads to some pretty fun choices. But it is not about avoiding mistakes (a la most Winsomes) but rather maximizing your moves over several turns. One thing I've noticed is that everyone *thinks* they are doing just fine because points are coming at you every which way. It is a family game, after all.

While the game plays quite nicely with two, more is certainly merrier. It brings out more interesting opportunities for parasitic play. Four is likely the sweet spot. It leads to enough cross-ownership and hijacking options to make things spicy. Also, it makes collection of chits that are not your hand card a more meaningful option since you are giving away, per opponent, closer to what you are getting (but likely you are still giving away more). See, a chit is worth one VP to the active player, but it is worth something to the person who secretly holds the card with that number. First, if they want to, the card holder can 'sell' the card at that moment for $3, effectively 3 liquid VPs. But this gives up its endgame value. This high value alone should make most people wary of collecting chits on spaces for which they don't have cards. If, however, the holder of the card chooses not to sell, the card may be worth 1, 2, 4, 5, or 8 points at the end of the game depending on which families end up there and whether the player owns them. (4VPs for 'your' families, 1VP for 'other' families.)

Overall, though, I find that the incentive creation and destruction that one finds in a lot of Winsome games is just not in this game. Ownership is just not fractured enough and the active player just gets too much of the spoils. What do I mean? Take a game like Preußische Ostbahn. A player ahead in turn order has a very good reason to set up another owner to make a connection. The resulting double dividend benefits them both equally. However, in Samarkand, the active player gets 67% more VPs than the non-active family member, so there is little reason to set someone else up. And without variable turn order, this creates some significant right/left binding issues. However, it also sets up some interesting blocking patterns. Another area where incentive play is blunted is in 'inviting' a connection. Since the passive family only gets $1 vs. $3 for the active family (and an extra 2VP for the active player), inviting a setup is not as attractive as it could be - even if you are married to both. (That is, you set up yourself to get $3+$1, but you give $3+2VP to another player.) Of course, getting other people to use their precious turns to earn you VPs in this lightning fast game can be a very good thing, especially if you got a goodly number of VPs by getting into the setup position.

Okay, so it is not a 'gamer's game.' But it is billed as a family game, so how does it succeed on that front? Very well, in fact. The luck and hidden information keep it very light, but the choices are always interesting, the gameplay is very quick, the production is lovely. I would say that it has the feel of Ticket to Ride, with the connection of hand cards and the blocking. While it is actually a better, more interesting game that that classic, it doesn't have the simplicity that makes TTR quite lovely in its own right - not to mention more suitable for a younger age range. The rules burden is on par with Settlers of Catan, but with more interesting and open-ended game play. But it doesn't have the direct social interaction (i.e. negotiation) that makes that game very enjoyable in a family/non-gamer setting. It has shareholding aspects that make it comparable to Acquire - another hidden information-laden, relatively rules-light, auctionless shareholding game - but it plays in much less time.

Overall, it is a game that has its place in my collection as being a quick, fun game that can be played a) in mixed gamer/non-gamer company and everyone gets something out of it, b) as a super-filler by gamers when we've just fried our brains on Dutch InterCity, or as true gateway game to heavier games. By 'true gateway', I mean that it is really for folks at the 'gateway' of the hobby. It is fun enough for everyone, but may actually give an indication of which players might be ready to jump into the heavier stuff. And if not, they'll love Settlers.

(3/23/10) Very preliminary after one play (2P). It has a lot of the things I love about Winsome cube rails games - game end timing management, incentive management, unscripted gameplay - but takes the bite out. Take out the auctions (and the grueling valuation), add some luck and hidden information, and the decisions remain interesting but much more forgiving. The timing issues become less about calculation and manipulation of incentives and more about estimation. There are fewer wrong moves, but good moves are not obvious. The fact that Natalie said she *really* liked it was a very good sign. This game is likely to land up there with Manila, China, or Acquire as true gateway games. That is, games that you are happy to play (not just willing) because they have real meat on the bones and that introduce non-hardcore players to 'gamey' concepts in a fun, forgiving environment. If that gateway doesn't lead anywhere - Natalie will NEVER play Dutch Intercity - that is fine too. We can play together and both enjoy. And I won't have to play another damned game of TTR.

RATING: 7
:indigo: :( :) :D :D :D Quite possibly the best gateway game I've ever played. Occupies a point between Ticket To Ride (super-simple mechanics, lightweight strategic depth) and Chicago Express (easy mechanics, incredible depth). Interactive but less oriented towards putting the screws to your neighbors than most route-building/share-holding games. Like Chicago Express, the endgame conditions are a function of player actions, and the player who controls the tempo has the power. Also like Chicago Express, it takes less than an hour to finish, even with complete n00bs at the table. But unlike CE, a game played with a naive and simplistic approach is unlikely to have everyone scratching their heads and saying "you mean that's it?"

RATING: 4
I went in thinking that this is like Age of Scheme or Chicago Express, or any other Winsome title, and got quite disappointed, having figured out that this is a high-luck, hidden information, fiddly point salad of a game. The problem is that although there are some sharp edges to this design (merger space spacing, shared incentives), the game feels that it has no audience. If I want a similar, but better developed game for families, I'd play Ticket to Ride, if I want a gamer's game of this ilk, I'd play Wabash. Not impressed, not at all..

+ great components
+ easy to teach
+ short and packing some decisions
+ merger space watching, shared incentives, game end influencing et al clever mechanisms

= luck of the draw is high
= point salad, if that's your thing

- does not work well with 2 (and is a different game altogether), the board feels quite loose, same with 3
- very fiddly setup for what you get, and quite fiddly scoring
- a pain to figure out where your goods are from your cards (despite the helpful card illustrations

Wow - this one really went over well with my group.  The first half felt quite different from the second as we all started out buying into families and then transitioned to some really speedy route connections.  Toward the end there was some nice tension as we all tried to figure out how many moves we might have a chance of squeezing in as the handshake piles started to dwindle. Great fun!

This was extremely well received by my brother, which, frankly, is a bit surprising to me. The game seems ok, but not terribly striking. I haven't played Chicago Express yet, but it reminded me a little of Stephensons Rocket, with different "train" companies growing. Although here the routes grow in any way they like, not just at the two ends. Here, you must first buy into a company (family), and only then can you make it grow. And only two players may buy into each family. The basic idea is to make families' routes which you've bought into reach the marked spaces matches your cards. There is a big advantage to making two different routes touch each other. And given that each route can only grow by two spaces per turn, there is a big element of stand-off where different families' routes are three spaces apart, The game seems a bit overly tactical for me, with very little strategy (or at least choices in different strategies). But there is an interesting mix of cooperation and competition, as joining routes helps others in those families (especially the family whose route is expanding to cause the join).

Maybe we just played poorly and with an insufficient player number (?) but this game is felt too light. It has a lot of mechanics that parody other economic decision making games, but didn't really seem to carry them off.

Good family game with a fair amount of strategy options and decision making to do. Artwork and components are good (as you expect from Queen) except for the female family portraits which present a rather masculine set of damsels - I actually found the picture of the sheep on the goods cards a more attractive proposition than any of the ladies available for marriage. Still, a minor point.

Samarkand was a great disappointment. I went back and forth about whether I should make a blind buy of it, but I was always concerned it would be too light and shallow for me so I held back. This was the correct decision. Claudio introduced me to this as well, and after our game I was left deeply underwhelmed by the game's apparent shallowness. However, in hindsight my lack of enjoyment of the game can potentially be attributed to the fact that we played it two player. That being said, I doubt that playing it with a larger group would increase my opinion of the game enough for it to be worth my time to play again.

RATING: 9
Players represent traders, marrying into merchant families to be able to influence in what direction their trade routes meander.  Very simple game, mechanically, in which a player on their turn can either marry into a family (and increase their portfolio of trade goods), or expand a caravan route of a family they have already married into.  The rules take about 3 minutes to teach, but the game play is surprisingly subtle and opportunistic.  Victory points are awarded on a 1 to 1 basis with cash, trade agreements between families, recovering trade chips off the board, and by which of your secret portfolio stock is reached by a caravan.  Plays blindingly fast, too.  We like this one a lot.

Another successful implementation of a Winsome cube rail game into something with (loads) more visual polish.   The game play is a little simplified from "Age Of Scheme" and so is the map.  I didn't mind that, but it could be a turn off for the hardcore cube railers.  The card scoring makes it very desirable to force mergers in specific zones, which gives a nice wrinkle to the game.   Like Chicago Express (Wabash), the game can end very quickly and catch you unprepared.  In many ways, it is like Through The Desert with a light economic element added on.

I normally dislike area-control type games, but this one does it right! It is very easy to play, since you only take one of two actions each turn. I'm also a fan of how once you start going there are no phases, upkeep, scoring rounds, or the like. Something akin to Ticket to Ride where once you begin, it keeps moving like clockwork until someone meets an end condition.

That said, I wish the layering of scoring could be simpler. Scoring once for two families meeting (taking 2 handshake chits) and scoring for the ownership of the camels, while sensible in mechanic standpoint feels redundant. Same with the goods chits and the scoring at the end game with cards matching them

Regardless, it is a keeper which is a rarity for my with this game genre.

RATING: 7.5
Clever game, fast to play and some nice decisions to be made. Maybe some lucky card draws can have a big effect on the game, almost if someone gets much from the center of the board. But there's other ways to gather points as well, so I think cards are still not the most decisive factor.

The idea is to marry into powerful families in and around Persia to set up trade routes to particular goods.  If you have a trade route to a good, a card that matches that good and are married into the family owning the trade route you get points.

Good family game for older children and adults about developing camel trade routes by marrying and forming trade relationships between families.  Family friendly version of Age of Scheme, with fantastic components.  Impressed after more than half a dozen plays so far.  Interactive without being vicious. Scales well, ideal length (30-40 minutes), and yet offers a good challenge for gamers offering strategy and tactics that most fillers can't give.
See my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/515432

Suggestion from Mikko Saari: "Don’t bother to place the goods tokens on the board. It’s a waste of time. It’s easy to see which goods are available: there’s no camel on the space."

I like that there are many different options to follow on a given turn.

I was just so surprised how well this worked  The card draws can determine the game, but when views as a family game, I almost consider that a positive.  The idea of a lighter winsome game just didn't seem like it would work. I generally like Winsome games, but don't love them.  Mostly because it seems like you end up doing a lot of math each turn before you get to start playing the real game.  It's especially annoying in some games where you do a bunch of calculating in the last round to bid $34 so you can make $35.  Samarkand eliminates the auctions completely, greatly reducing the game time and number crunching at the cost of some control.  What results is a tense, can't-do-everything type of game that is over before you know it.  It's certainly lighter than it's older siblings, but many of the familiar elements that make those games good can be found here.  Given the play time, this thing almost feels like more bang for time spent.  Color me impressed.

I need to give this another play before I decide whether it is brilliantly simple or just simple.

It seems to me your game is more influenced by what others do than what you do;  buy into a family that might become connected, hang your hopes on a random selection of cards, and push a few camels around to try and achieve it.  It's about choosing the right bedfellows.

My one three-player game may not be anything to go on, but this game felt like it was over just as it was developing.

I have to give it another play or two; but for now my rating stands.

RATING: 7
Samarkand is essentially an ultra-light train game. Imagine Chicago Express with only two shares per company where you can buy a share instead of auctioning it off, and you're actually not too far off the mark.

The decisions to take each turn are reduced to investing in a new company (or, thematically, marrying into another family), or extending existing trade routes to establish trading partnerships with other companies or to increase the value of your trading posts. Payouts are very straight-forward, and you don't really have to worry too much about your money, either. Whether this missing tension is a plus or a minus for the game might depend on your individual point of view. For me, something is missing.

Still, all of this makes Samarkand an easy game to understand and play - for gamers at least.

OK game. Apart from a family running out of camels, and thus expansion possibilities, there are no real constraints for the players to worry about. My group felt that this detracted from the game, but it's probably because it's more a family game than a gamer's game that this was included.

There’s a hint of shareholding and an interesting hand and money management mechanism: your hand of cards is limited, and you get new cards only by investing (“marrying into a family”), but the money being converted into VP, making the right amount of investments is crucial. 

Easy and fast to explain, very fast to play –the endgame can be very abrupt!

The rules were easy to learn, and the game plays quite quickly (about 30 minutes seems right).  Not sure I know the strategy, or if it's too random due to the card draws.  If you get locations that are close to each other, you can pick up some big points with a single set of camels.  But then again, other players might connect to your "out of reach" card locations, and you can either take 3 points immediately or you can marry into those families to get 4 points at the end of the game.

This game is filled with lots of little tactical decisions.  Should I take the money now to allow me to marry into another family?  Do I have time to build towards another location, or will the game end too soon?  If I don't marry into this family, will someone else get it?  If someone already has married into a family, are they about to make a move that gives connections points, and should I marry into that family to gain some benefit from those connections?

In all, a mildly interesting game which is worth playing a few times to see if I like it better.

Samarkand is the republished, pimped out Queen version of the Winsome Age of Scheme game. With Queen game graphics and components its a colorful and pretty package, but doesn't stray far from the theme of the original.

Players are traders, marrying into various nations/clans across Eurasia and Africa. Because money=VP, Marriages  are expensive, but they open up camels (not trains) for use, and fund clan (not company) treasuries.

Clans try to claim historic goods, and guide their camel trains to where goods on their cards are found. They also try to actively intermingle, founding new trade relationships. These bring badly needed cash, and push the game along to it's conclusion.

The base Samarkand game is not bad- a heavy family weight game, perhaps- but perhaps not as challenging or interesting as some other Winsome games.

I'm starting this at a 6.75 aftre a couple of plays. It good, but not terrific as it stands.

(NOTE: With the Family Connections expansion this definitely improves- I rated the expanded game a 7 on a first play.)

This is an outstanding design, in terms of simplicity, speed, depth, and fun. It is very accessible and family friendly. Some call it a train game, sort of like Chicago Express (same designer) disguised as a camel game, but the theme is very immersive. It has been very popular at the meetups and game nights since Geekway to the West, as there are always people clamoring to play it. As a light-to-moderate weight filler for four or five players, it works well and feels just as satisfying as Oregon, one of my favorite quick games. Since it plays so quickly, and since it does take some time to set up, people always want to play it again in rapid succession. It helps to get all the bits of each family organized in plastic cups or bags, so that set up is a breeze.

Update (08/26/10) 15 plays: excellent gateway game. A touch fiddly for initial set-up, even with organization.

Update (12/26/10) 22 plays: continues to have staying power as an excellent gateway game, or as a quick mid-light game between heavy games. Also finds favor when introduced amongst veteran players who have never played the game.

Update (02/24/11) 31 plays: most of my gaming group are in agreement that this game has peaked. It is too chaotic and game end is too sudden with 5 players. Sweet spot may be 4. With 3 players, it may not have enough tension and feel more like multi-player solitaire.

Update (10/14/11): 36+ plays: It's not bad bringing this out once in awhile, for a light game to decompress after heavier fare. This is clearly a family-oriented game, and I believe the gaming veterans have played this to death. I'm getting the sense that Queen Games is like Days of Wonder: both tend to have games that have outstanding components, excellent rules, easy and fluid gameplay, delightful themes, and all around accessibility. However, because of this, they tend to get played repeatedly, and then the players burn out; it seems easy to "figure it out", so with the exception of newcomers, most don't want to play them after the initial hoopla.

Update (08/18/2014) 58 plays: this is a very good game with lots of staying power. Still a solid "8" after four years. Excellent gateway game for newbies. Kind of short for five-players, as it can end suddenly, but then so can three-player games. Played two-player for the first time. Somewhat enjoyable, but felt like we were playing solitaire against each other. Still, it is something to do for 40 minutes. Two-player is a "7".

A Samarkand egy gyönyörű kidolgozású, jó hangulatú, könnyed családi játék. Szabályai gyorsan tanulhatók, egyszerűek, hamar átláthatók, ezért kezdőknek is bátran ajánlható. Hat év feletti gyerekek már könnyedén tudnak vele játszani és a színes tevék lerakását biztosan jó mókának fogják találni. Én már az első játék során megszerettem és tudtam, hogy kell ez a játék otthonra. Be is szereztem, amit egyáltalán nem bántam meg. Nagy előnye, hogy kettőtől öt főig bármennyi játékos játszhatja.

Hátránya, hogy kifejezetten drága játék, hiszen az ára tízezer forint felett van. Persze a sok alkatrészt és a gyönyörű kidolgozást meg kell fizetni. A taktikai lehetőségek és a játék újrajátszhatósága a fix térkép miatt alacsony, ezért komoly játékosok nem ezzel fognak játszani. Viszont gyerekekkel való játékra tökéletes és némi bevezetést is adhat nekik a licitálós játékok világába, vagyis mikor érdemes beházasodni (licitálni) egy családba mikor nem.

A quick, light game with a decent chance for decision making.  A couple of bad plays can very quickly throw the game to someone, which can be frustrating if a new player makes you lose.  Related to this is that the game can end surpisingly quickly.  But if so you can try again.

After a few plays, I've learned to take this game on its own terms and my impression of it continues to improve.  Yes, it is a [i]very[/i] forgiving take on the stock holding train genre, but there is quite a bit lurking under the surface for those who choose to go looking for it.  In particular the end-game timing can take people by surprise and be a powerful weapon if your opponents happen to invest all their money at an inopportune time. The cards do add a large element of luck, but I find it's not generally a game-breaker - often the scores are impressively close.  The lack of opaque value determinations also means the game moves very quickly and provides great value for the time invested (if only it didn't take so damn long to set up and tear down).  I see this one sticking around for awhile.

RATING: 7
Pros: It's a train game (disguised as a camel game) that has tough decisions and plays quickly. Tough choices about how to best help yourself while also helping others.

Cons: It's difficult to determine who's winning from looking at the board. This does not go well together with the fact that when the game ends is very much in the players' hands. Spreadsheet scoring at the end, which I always find anticlimactic.

So, a fine game that just suffers in comparison to its peers. I'd always rather choose Paris Connection (for a quicker game) or German Railways, American Rails, or Chicago Express (for longer game with players who can stomach auctions).

It's actually quite enjoyable. However, I am totally spoiled by Queen Games' other offering, Chicago Express.

Sort of a cross between Chicago Express and Through the Desert, with a couple of elements reminiscent of Ticket to Ride and Race for the Galaxy.  Instead of trains like in Chicago Express, you have camels.  There's only two "shares" of each caravan, and having a share lets you share equally with the other owner, if any.  Up to two caravans can share a particular space, and the first time the lines merge, the caravan who cause the merger gets "marriage tokens" and a cash bonus (with a smaller bonus to the other caravan).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Feels a bit like a "Chicago Express-light'ish" game. Plays fast. Players buy influence in trading families/companies, expand their trade routes/track, grab goods tokens reached by a route and try to merge families. Points are awarded during the game for acquiring trade goods and doing mergers, and at the end of the game for those trade cards reached by families, and for money on hand.

Very light game, rules-wise. Plays very quickly too. Entertaining enough, but it's almost a bit too bland and abstract for its own good. Looks like a big box game but plays like a filler.

RATING: 7
The board is a map of the Middle East with 33 resources pretty evenly spaced out. There are 8 families with two marriage tiles and 12 camels each. There is also a deck of 33 cards, one for each resource on the board. Each player starts with 2 cards in hand and 10 cash. On a turn, a player can either marry into a family - the player pays into that family's coffers a set amount, takes one of the marriage tiles and draws 3 goods cards - or place camels on the board for families the player has already married into. In placing camels, players want to reach goods spaces for which they have cards and/or meet up with other families and form trade relationships. Players get paid for relationships based on which families they have "invested" in. Endgame bonuses are largest for families you control with camels on goods that you own. With a limit of 2 camels per space, and only 12 camels per family, there's plenty of opportunities to cut others off and control when and where families meet to maximize your bonuses, and minimize those for other players.

It's a very good game. I would describe it as a step up from the family game category, similar maybe to Power Grid in complexity. I could potentially see games getting a bit samey after a while.

UPDATE: This game is still solid, but the long set up for the simple premise is a bit much. Also, the game tends to end just when it feels like it is heating up. I do think I like this more than the similarly-weighted Paris Connection. Downgraded this a point.

The Winsome heritage is recognizable. This is announced as a family game and can be played as such. The lack of auctions and the introduction of a random factor with the cards make it more accessible. But an average family gamer will miss the point of this game. Not as much as in Chicago Express but concepts as controlling the end of the game as well as the openness of gameplay necessitating a development strategy for a meaningful game are key to getting the potential out of this game.

RATING: 7
A pleasant surprise, Samarkand puts Winsome-style train games through wind-tunnel testing to produce a streamlined train-style game in a typically lovely Queen Games presentation. There's a little bit of investing (through marriage) and route building (via camels rather than literal trains), but the whole operation has been cut down to the bare minimum. Thirty minutes may be a tad optimistic, but it'll certainly play in well under an hour. I'm not entirely sure what you've accomplished when you've finished, because it seems like it was just getting started, but it's a pretty fun and winsome ride.

RATING: 7
I like the idea of this game, and enjoyed playing it, but there are a couple things that prevent it from achieving greatness.

1. It is obviously intended for a family audience.  If that is the case, the setup is a huge pain.  If setup could be simplified it would be a lot more attractive to play.

2. The theming of the game is pretty boring and though I guess it kind of makes sense, it still seems pretty weird.

3. I think it takes some work to get into this game.  I feel like I'm a relatively seasoned game player, yet it took me a while to figure out how the game worked.  If I sprung this on people that aren't really used to playing games, I would need to be very careful in my explanation to avoid confusing them.

A railroad-/stock game that has got the looks and feel of a family game. You can't monopolize a company for yourself and the camels, how they're played and how there most often seems to be a need to use more of them than you can on your turn, also reminds of Through the Desert. For me the theme is more entertaining than trains and as the game play is really fast paced and straightforward the game time becomes a really pleasant half an hour.

I think I slightly prefer Chicago Express, but which I would choose to play would depend on the audience.

RATING: 8
An interesting low strategy but very high on tactics board game, of marrying into families and expanding/merging family routes.  I didn't think much of it on my first play but after further in-depth review, I think it has many subtle interesting choices.  It's fairly simple in rules but a good deal of hidden depth, and plenty of tactics.  However, I'm concerned that with future 5-player games, where I may have issue with the game allowing lagging players to prematurely end it from a losing position (where they are in a situation they believe they cannot attain a better score compared to the others).  I think 3 players is best for this hidden gem.

This is a quick and fun economic game with shared incentives among players. Despite only two major actions possible on each move, the game offers much to consider in the decision making process. There also seems to be different strategies, for instance a rush strategy where a central family gobbles up goods and merges to end the game quick. Or an investor with his hands in many families and saving . Or moneybags who collects goods tokens and always sells. My only complaint is that setup and post-game scoring are time consuming.

Playing is more fun, though.

I loved this game when it was not a beautifully constructed Queen game, and I love it even more now that it is.  The production is top notch, and the only thing I noticed in the rules that gave me any concern was a double period at the end of one sentence.  Good luck finding any rulebook out there today that I can't read and immediately spot six or more glaring errors.  Great work, rules writers!  Sure, sure, I read it when I was half asleep, but when am I not half asleep?  The optimists don't even bother saying I'm half awake, any more.  Damn them to hell, those miserable optimists.  Why I oughtta....  In any event, my wife and I played it three times the first night, and that is AMAZING for this household.  Solid 10, based solely on the 2-player game, but then, that's really the only version I'll ever need, it seems.

An improvement over [gameid=38637] as it plays much faster and leaves out the somewhat boring auction mechanic.  I'm quite impressed with the production.  Very interesting twist on a stock game.

An addictive little gem, a sort of "18Camel".  This would be an ideal gateway game for children as young as 9 (speaking from experience).  The components are, as usual from this source, beautiful and clever.  Even the 2-player rules work well.  I prefer the variant where each player receives 3 cards at the start and discards one.  The game seems to expire just before it becomes tedious, and the play time runs an hour or less.

Given how much I really enjoy Chicago Express, I had very high hopes for this, but in the end it was not at all my thing.

It was just... bland in every way.

Multiple reviewers compare this to other games by the publisher that are much heavier train + economic games. This supposedly is a family version to them.

You don't control one family, but rather try to score points by having your goods owned by families that you have influence in at the end of the game.

In order to expand trade routes, you have to be in the family.

Sounds ok.

Nem vártam sokat a játéktól, de pozitívan csalódtam! Kevés és egyszerű szabályok, gyors játékidő (tényleg 45perc 4-en elsőre), és végig leköti a figyelmet.
A házasodás/tevelerakás gyakorlatilag egy részvényvásárlás barátságosabb köntösbe öltöztetve, de én személy szerint megkajáltam. Sőt az egymással való össze-vissza-keresztbe házasulás sok nevetést és jó hangulatot adott a játékhoz.
Mindazonáltal bizony figyelni kellett, mit hogy érdemes, és bár a gondolkodásba nem szakad bele az ember, pont elegendő volt ahhoz, hogy lekössön. Az egyszerű szabályok, a nem nehéz döntések, és rövid körök nagyon pörgőssé tették a játékot, így holtidőről egyáltalán nem beszélhetünk. Annál is inkább, mert ügyes házasulással, csak dől a pénz saját körön kívül is!
A laphúzásnál figyelni kell a kézlimitre, sajnos végig dobálni kell húzás után (és csak akkor lehet!! miért?), mert ha kézlimitet elértük, nem lehet többé lapot húzni (és így dobni sem. Ez kicsit furcsa is, meg szemétség!:))

Almost surprised by how much I enjoy this game - far more depth in decision making here than I expected initially.

Complaints are primarily around game speed: it can be pushed to an end very quickly, so much that the time spent setting up the board can feel imbalanced. Some odd component choices exacerbate this: why use specific goods instead of generic VP markers?

Always keen to play this game, although haven't played it often enough to rate a 10... yet.

Samarkand: Routes To Riches is a quirky game. After a couple plays I'm still not sure what I think of it. The idea of royalty marrying into other royal families to get varying resources is a unique theme for a game. Despite its big box packaging it is a decidedly short play, almost filler in length.

It is not a bad game, but I didn't like the gameflow. In our 5-player game 3/4 of the game took place in the west and you are only invested in 3 (max 4) families during the whole game. I think the family meetings can hardly be controlled, so I tried to maximize my points without much enthusiasm.

RATING: 7
A pretty interesting game where you are marrying your family into other families to extend their reach of pathways.  Hopefully you are extending the paths that you acquire towards goods and valuable spaces.  

The scoring at the end of the game was a bit confusing.  I want to play this game again before finalizing my thoughts.

Meaty filler or fillery meat. There's 10 trains (aka camel colours) to invest in, 2 shares per train. Once you've invested in a colour by putting money into its treasury (one type of turn), then you can spend that colour's treasury money (the other type of turn) to add camels into adjacent spaces a la Durch die Wuste. There are 33 cities on the board and everytime you invest in a train you get some city cards to keep. If you can drive your colours to each of your cities, big points. If you can expand one colour into the space of another colour (a la Stephensons Rocket) that also gets big points (but they don't merge, just payout). Turns fly past as there are obvious things you want to drive for and the decisions aren't that hard. A lot of your result will depend on whether you get cards that are close together, allowing you to invest in 2 colours that get to them rather than having to invest in colours on different sides of the board. That's the fillery side. On the meatery side, there's lots of ways to earn VPs and it's all about doing them efficiently given the game's all over in 30 minutes. All in all, it's a nice game which fills a niche (light stock game) well without being demanding.

Based on one play: The board is very busy, with 10 different trains, I mean families, trying to connect their routes with camels. You buy into families and then can expand them getting money and points if they meet another family and collecting tokens on the board. The main way to get points is to have the matching card to a token that one of your families is on (on better yet, two of them are on). Keeping track of the tokens and colors is a little annoying, but the game is fun to play and there are a lot of decisions to make.

The odd thing is that this has none of the razor sharp Winsome play you'll find in Chicago Express or Preußische Ostbahn.  I think Queen milked all the venom out of the snake that was Age of Scheme. This is basically another Eurogame, multiple paths to victory, yawn.

nice art though.

RATING: 7
This is a connection game in which you "invest" in different families, and then try to connect those families' caravans to a secret hand of goods cards (essentially cities) on the map.  Your hand builds up as the game progresses, so you can't plan your entire strategy from the beginning.  Each family can have two investors, which can be problematic as the family can run out of caravan camels if they go in too many directions.  I found this game to be fairly pleasant, and it evoked feelings of Ticket to Ride, but without much of the suspense.

An interesting variant of the original & an excellent introduction to Winsome-style games. Everyone I introduce it to immediately wants to play it again. I like it much more than I thought I would & it continues to grow on me.
More incentive to build in this one & the card manipulation is very subtle (didn't get this at first).
Game ends very fast & it is easy to mistime things.  All in all, a solid 8 & I highly recommend for beginners.

Lighter than I would like for a game with "gamers", but it's proven very successful with more casual folks. This is the only game I know of that has a train-game/stocks system that I can play with my family without a single complaint. (nb. I haven't played Acquire). 

While many turns require choices between point-equivalent options, the positional considerations (trying not to set up good moves for other players) and shared interests make the game a bit more interesting. 

Similarly, the flexible game-end condition means different plays can have very different paces, either an extended hunt for goods, or a quick route-connection frenzy. Of course, trying to steer the game one way or another is part of the fun.

Cute, light, fun.  I enjoyed the routing and resource pickup, I enjoyed the family marriage and how to spend the family's money aspect.  I thought the slight tug of two family heads going in different directions was very interesting.  It might be a little too light for some crowds, but I really felt like this was a great family game and a great gateway route-building game.

Since I liked Paris Connection, I figured I would give this game a try. Essentially on your turn you invest in one of the two stock tokens belonging to one of the trading companies. If you are invested in a company, you can place camels for those companies. Each player has the opportunity to grab endgame scoring cards, and those cards essentially ask for you to get one or two companies you have stock in to put a camel in a specific spot on the board marked with a particular goods icon. There are mini points for being the first to place into a goods icon spot, and for getting two trading companies to meet each other for the first time, but overall this game was dull, and had little to no meaningful decision points for the players. Quite a bit of the game was simply looking to see what was 2 away, and then putting camels down in the direction of the goods your cards directed you towards.

Samarkand is an engaging and fun game.  Just looking at it one would think it is complicated, but it is actually pretty easy to teach and play, though it is just a bit fiddly.  The game is all about finding the right time to move into certain areas and trying to get the other players to play in ways that will also benefit you.  It is not super deep, but it is fun

I am all for games that don't overstay their welcome, but in Samarkand my one complaint is that often the ga
mes are to fast.  It often feels like just as the game is getting good it ends.  This can also amplify luck because if someone draws good resource cards they can race to a quick lead and then end the game as quick as possible.

Lastly, this game is usually compared to its big brother and bashed because it is not as deep.  I think it is a bit unfair to judge it on that axis because it was designed to be a simpler game, and that direct comparison shouldn't count against it

Excellent game. It appeals to players of all skill levels.

- plays extremely fast in about 30 minutes or so
- fits a comfortable 2-5 players
- easy to understand rules
- no player elimination
- strategy is fairly clear
- depth in player interaction
- beautiful game

It's really the perfect game.

It tops:

- Ticket to Ride (shorter, does not need expansion, plays well from 2-5, not just 4-5)
- Setters of Catan (fits 5 opposed to 4 players, can't get screwed by bad initial placement)
- Race for the Galaxy (easier rules to learn)
- Chicago Express (strategy is more clear than opaque, game isn't decided by one player messing up)

One issue I do have is that the setup for this game can be lengthy. If you have people helping you however, it can go fast. It's a good game, but I think I have to give this position to Splendor.

I feel like too much of the game comes down to the starting assets collectively held by the players. We've seen franticly fast games where the players in the center blitzed past everyone else. We've seen others go longer with fewer players and no player(s) having a starting advantage.

Overall it is enjoyable but not memorable

A light and quick economic game. Control the timing of when you "marry" into a family, expansion, and ultimately, when the game will end. The cards add an interesting decision point - do I sell that good now for the much needed capital, or do I save it for the VPs in the end? How do I maximize the VPs on any given card? Is it worth the effort?

The rules are simple and the game is accessible to many different people of all ages. Also quite good for 2 players, though luck of the draw is exacerbated.

While I prefer less luck and more strategy, my concerns are mitigated by the quick playtime. We can easily play a 2-player game in 30 minutes. Plenty of fun here!

RATING: 7.5
After the first 2p game, I was pleased but not wowed.  It was a slow accumulation of trading relationships and goods until finally I stopped the game by my Levant family acquiring five relationships.  My opponent didn't focus on the relationship aspect (unsurprising since it was a learning game for us both) and I won by a landslide.

The second game however played completely differently.  My wife saw that she had acquired all of the goods cards in her hand and that it would be difficult for her to develop on her end game scoring so manipulated a quick finish through her Tigris family.  Although, I'd set up myself for some big points, I needed a few more turns and  was ultimately powerless to stop the end game coming about.  She won by a good 20 points.

So not only do you have to think about the spatial relationship between all of the families for the purposes of building relationships and end game goods scoring, but also in respect of controlling the game end.

Despite the relatively long potential set-up time, it can be greatly reduced by organisation of the insert, and so is not a major put-off.  Very much looking forward to next game of this, especially to see how it plays with more than 2.

RATING: 6
Fast, very fast game.  Lots of ways to score VPs but the thrust will be for goods spaces where one owns both families - so establishing new connections will probably be the key which in turn will be driven by the cards one has which might dictate what families to marry into.  But it does have a nice feel to show a bit of what a winsome game will be like.  I can see why it is called Chicago Express without the auctions - which might make this a good intro to that sort of game.  I also have Age of Scheme and would like to try that also to see which feels more satisfying at the table.

I don't like Acquire, and Samarkand is a distant grand-nephew of that classic. But really, quite a clever disguise! I'm really not a fan of this kind of--basically--"stock market" game. I'm certainly willing to play it, and it is rather a quick play at all player counts. Downtime is greater at five, but the game length itself is about the same as with three.

Personal preference though--the decisions in these sorts of games (Acquire, Union Pacific/Airlines Europe, Chicago Express) are not that compelling to me. Perhaps my gaming tastes will evolve into this genre someday...I've seen examples of that in others.

RATING: 6
Eight is a very generous rating, but this just patches a nice divot in my gaming collection enough to deserve it. Easy rules to remember. Easy to teach. Plays in about 45 minutes. Enough to think about that it doesn't seem simplistic despite the simple gameplay.

It's got some clever quirks I appreciate amongst the smooth play. The two camel limit works as a nice blocking mechanic as you meet other families head on. The points bonus being given in marketplaces make you think about where you want to meet that'll either be optimal for you or no so for your opponents. Only two shares in each family keeps it simple. The hand limit and its drawing limitation makes you lock in that final marketplace. 

All nice and easy, but fun to think about at the same time. It never feels like it's dragging. Players seem to be able to make their decisions quickly despite there being quite a few valid choices each turn. There's some luck in the cards if your markets are bunched together or spread out, but you're not locked into one area or just getting points through the cards, so it doesn't really matter as much as you might think. The cards and particularly the early selling of goods for three money are however perhaps the only aspect of the game that felt a bit flat to me. Because selling a goods card counts towards your hand limit it seems players are reluctant to trade in cards for instant cash, but a potential loss of victory points. I wouldn't dream of changing the design, but the inner rules tweaker inside me does wonder if it'd be better if there were two of each marketplace in the deck and a sold good only got you two money, but didn't count towards your hand limit. (Only one market card could be sold for cash.)

I'm not sure the cash going into the family treasury really has much of an impact either beyond making the game more fiddly as you hunt around for one Dirham coins. (That and making families starting on the edges even less desirable if they only get one investor.) I'd prefer it if each player had to pay from their own treasury for a second camel if they want to place one. This'd make money a bit tighter and players would have to evaluate more whether placing a second camel would be worth it for them, and whether selling off market cards early for a bit of extra cash now would be worth doing.

From a graphic design standpoint I'd have liked to see a bolder representation of the marketplaces on the board. I do find it a bit tricky to spot numbers when they have two camels planted on top of them.

Good stuff.

A quick-playing, family-friendly game of stocks and route-building. Sort of like the route-building and stock-buying of Wabash Cannonball, but without auctions (fixed-price shares) and every company (family) has only 2 shares. But much lighter.

--- Summary ---
You invest in families ("marriages"; max 2 players per family), and use the invested money to build networks of caravans (cute cameleeples). These collect goods tokens on the board (worth 1VP each), and also create alliances with other families when they first meet (worth 2VP; max 1 alliance per pair; max 2 camels per space). Whenever you invest (marry) into a family, you draw 3 cards (matching the goods scattered on the board); must keep at least one of those; may discard 0-2 including previously held cards; max hand size 7. Whenever a camel first goes into a goods hex (and collects the token), the player with that card MAY play it immediately for $3. Game ends when any family has formed 5 alliances, or all families have formed at least 1 alliance. For final scoring, unplayed cards are worth additional points if camels are in those squares: 1/camel if you're not invested in the family, 4/camel if you are. Money is worth 1VP each. Most VP wins.

RATING: 5
Seems way too complicated for a family game. I played it about a month ago, then had to look at pictures of the game board to trigger my memory.  Not a good sign.  It's okay, but feels like just another dry, area control abstract.  Camels might not mind how dry it is, but it's not enough fun to push it over the hump for me.

RATING: N/A
Can't rate it yet because I've only played a two player game. It was not very fun to play but I have the expectation of improvement if played with more players - 4 at least. It seems that kind of the more the merrier game. 

I like some of the ideas of the game and I will consider to play it once more but with more players just to clear things up. The arabian ambience that the board provides it's kind of cool and it makes total sense. The railway kind of game but with camels also works pretty nice. Marrying or not and choosing the right timing for such a decision seems to be fundamental in Samarkand which is something that makes sense too. 

Played again with four players. Didn't dislike it by heart. In fact I think it can be a lot better with three players because the control is way better. Still a nice filler with some thinking in an extremely annoying setup!

This is pseudo-train game but with camels.  And instead of buying stock in companies, you are buying gifts for weddings "buying" into families.  The game seemed to end well before it was supposed to.  I think the ser-up took longer than the game.  It seemed like a simple exercis in maximizing points each turn without much need for future planning.  I probably won't try this again unless others at the table really want to try it.

RATING: 8
Solid game after first play.  For anyone who's played many Winsome train games, this feels unerringly like a train game, regardless of what the theme has become.  You're basically buying 1 of 2 shares available in a train company thereby feeding capital into the company for track building, rather than marrying into a family.  You're merging companies, not establishing trade routes.  The companies can spend capital to lay an extra piece of track.  And you're trying to establish particular routes for bonuses.

But whatever, the game is still fun.  I wish I could get a copy of the original to play since I'd probably like it even more.  But on the good side, this will easily see a lot of play since it is VERY fast and has great depth.  The luck is minimal in terms of being a game-changer, rather it is more about building to make use of what you get--closer to random starting locations in other games.  As a for-instance, the person who got the lucky goods card draw with all the goods in a corner of the map where he quickly bought into both "families" there, did not win.

Based on my previous experiences with laying camels (wait, that didn't sound right) - "Through the Desert" and "Timbuktu" - I had high hopes for Samarkand.  I was also anticipating a nice, simple introduction to the "shares"-style "train" games.  Well, it is quite simple and streamlined and the production value is gorgeous (with the exception of some of those fugly family members!) but I wasn't wowed.  Game play is tight and there are several ways to score points, but I would have liked to see a stronger aspect of having to co-operate with other players to acquire points while trying not to give them too many points.  I don't think this is a bad game by any means - it's well-designed, has multiple ways to acquire points, and even has over 100 cameeples in 10 colours! - rather, there was just a fun factor or even an element of tension that was lacking.  At this point in my gaming life, I'm leaning quite heavily toward fun (a very subjective word!!), well-themed games, and less toward games like Samarkand which feels somewhat like an efficiency optimization exercise.  I was convinced by my previous reading about this game that it would be a hit, but it goes to show, you don't know until you've actually played!  I guess for my "shares" fix I'll just have to check out the alternate rules provided with the "Railroad Tycoon" expansion "Railways of England and Wales".  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

Adequate little [-]train[/-]camel game where you [-]buy shares in railways[/-]marry into trading families. Fast and light, but marred by inelegant scoring and too much randomness in the goods cards. Suffers a little from the Paris Connection syndrome where play is so quick that setup seems excessive. Enjoyable but not interesting enough to keep.

Interesting setup that seems to end before it hits the middle game.  Terrible choice of name.  Evidently we're going to spend the rest of our lives referring to two games as "Samarkand -- the Sid Sackson one" and "Samarkand -- the other one, not the Sid Sackson one."

This is a brilliant little game that is basically a train game in disguise.  Instead of buying shares, you marry into families.  Consider this a family version of Chicago Express.  Really quite good and great for 2 players.

The Winsome titles have always intrigued me, but I'm not going to buy them as I have standards when it comes to components and stuff. And the good ones will be republished. Mostly by Queen Games it seems.
I enjoyed [thing=31730][/thing] and this game is clearly from the same family. But it is lighter, more family friendly. Extremely family friendly in fact. Very simple rules, short turns, short playing time and not too much depth. In fact, you could almost call this Chicago Express light. I kind of wonder in fact: if Winsome is a publisher that caters only to the die hard gamer crowd, why would they design a game this family friendly? I can only imagine it was designed specifically to be republished later by Queen Games.
Anyway, how did I like it? Well, it works fine, it plays very well and fast and lacks any depth that would give it any staying power. It's enjoyable while it lasts and is completely forgettable at the same time. If that's what you like, this is game you should check out. If you want a game with depth or staying power, steer clear!

Queen got what they wanted - a family game. This one has the makings of a good stock/rail game that has been lightened up by random luck from the goods cards.

This is a clever and fairly quick-playing game.  There are a lot of decisions to be made over a short time span, which always makes for a pretty good game.  There are advantages to being right in the thick of things in the center of the map, and in being alone and getting points just for yourself.

Given the short play length and buzz, I had high hopes for Samarkand: Routes to Riches. Some of my favorite games are ones that pack a lot of punch into a quick game (Yspahan and Web of Power are two examples of games that feel big and meaty but play in 45 minutes or so). Unfortunately, some games take on too much of a luck factor To achieve the short play time, and Samarkand falls into that category. The start of the game is pretty straightforward: buy into the families near the spots for which you have cards, and turn in the cards for money to buy into another family or two. From this point, it's all luck, pure and simple. If you are lucky enough to draw some of the cards you traded in a second time as cards get recycled, great. You win. If you instead draw all the cards in areas where nobody built, too bad. You lose. Well, that's merely my biggest quibble with the game. It also lacked tension and fun, which might have made the high luck factor more tolerable. Samarkand misses by a wide margin for me, but in the interest of full disclosue, I'm not a big fan of stock market games in general (Acquire and Shark also bore me), and Samarkand has quite a bit of that dynamic, as well, which doesn't help my rating.

The publisher has successfully built a stock market game that doesn't feel like one.  Players invest in families that expand across the board to obtain treasures.  When they meet, bonuses are scored for what feel like prearranged marriages.  This all works great, but the desert theme--and the camels specifically--feel far removed from the more interesting development of family dynasties.

Not a bad game. Has a similar feel to the more recent Via Nebula, where you have to partner with your opponents in order to succeed. Also, both are train games that don't use actual trains.

Only one play so far, but a couple of things could be potential issues. One is the start player advantage. The game ends immediately when a certain condition is met, so the start player could potentially take one more turn than everyone else if he ends the game. This could possibly be mitigated by the partnership aspect or something that I'm not seeing, but I'm not sure. Also the luck of the draw. It seems like you could get lucky and get a number of free points by the luck of the draw, where other players might have to do more work to get points based on their cards.

I did enjoy the game and want to play again to see how impactful those issues actually are.

I was a bit nervous about this acquisition -- could a nasty Winsome train game really be turned into a family Euro?  Fortunately, the answer is that yes indeed, it can.  It even maintains the soul of a Winsome game -- in the feel of the game and the system of alliances that are created.  And not having to run mental spreadsheets every  few minutes when an auction comes up is nice and relaxing for a change.  All that said, it won't ever replace its heavier cousins in my heart or on the the table with my economic game loving game group.  But it is a nice alternative with the family or end-of-the night relaxing wind-down with the game group.

First came Samarkand, the newest offering from “Harry Wu,” which is a reworking of the controversial Age of Scheme. Samarkand is a train game disguised as a game about camel caravans. It is remarkably like Queen’s previous train game Chicago Express. The principal differences are that: (a) Samarkand only takes about 30 minutes to play rather than 60 minutes; (b) there are no auctions because instead players buy “shares” in the train companies (i.e., families) for a set price; and (c) there is a significant amount of luck in the game due to the card draw whereas Chicago Express involved no luck. While the playing time is impressively short and the game remarkably dense in terms of packing decision-making into a small amount of time, the level of luck made this one unsatisfying to me. I played a four-player game of this on Thursday and a second four-player game of this two days later on Saturday, and came in first in one and second in the other, but didn’t feel like I’d done anything to deserve those results. Players draw resource cards corresponding to locations on the map when they purchase a share and if you happen to draw cards that are geographically close together then your actions can be much more efficient and effective. There are some interesting decisions to be made along the way and the game is short enough to make the luck tolerable, but I can’t really see ever choosing to play Samarkand over Chicago Express unless playing with people who really despise auctions.

I got this to be my first train game. I liked it but didn't feel I picked up a good grasp of the strategy. It seems in hindsight that it might be helpful to keep track of where everyone is sitting score-wise (which is not that obvious because it depends on cards in people's hands), by putting cubes or something on the map, but that would slow the game down.

I guess in general the strategy is to try to get cards for locations that are as close together as possible, and "invest" in families in the area so that they can all build track to those locations, and also connect with each other.

On paper it (like other train games I gather) is at heart a commodity speculation game. You can buy into a family you think might do well, perhaps piggybacking off other players' efforts.

...What seems to make this unusual for a stock game is that the value of a stock (a family) depends on the player (the overlap between the family's territory and the player's hand of cards).

...More play. I am using colored cubes to mark the territories of people's cards. It compromises hidden information but I don't see it as a big deal in this game. Really fun game; you want to do a number of things and can't be sure that you'll be able to do them all, and turns are so fast and simple that it's irresistable to keep playing through turns to see what will happen.

But, this doesn't feel like a stock game at all, since you're primarily just trying to wrestle out some agreement between your routes and your cards.

Also, while this game does ask interesting questions, if you have bad luck with your cards you can definitely lose with there being nothing you could've done to stop it.

...The standoffs are kind of annoying: Two families being three spaces away and neither can make progress towards a connection without letting the other family get the reward. The expansion actually aggravates this, though it does reduce the weight of the scoring from cards-to-board agreement.

A very good train game and with just two shares per family makes the decisions of what and when to buy very interesting.  It is fast, and can end far sooner than you expect.  A good introduction for families for this type of game (as the camels and families may distract them from it being train based !), but good for gamers to get a quick fix.
Ironically the added chrome of the goods tiles is more of a hassle to set up than just dumping a cube in each spot (which is how a winsome game would have done it !)

A really jam-packed game in under 45 minutes. Samarkand is a cross between Through the Desert and as I have been told, Chicago Express. The game itself is quite involved and contains many interesting decisions to be made within the short game play. Game play revolves around getting points through camel placements on good cards, especially camels that belong to families that you have ties with. I am intrigued by the requirements of buying into a family and then subsequently using the same pool of money to expand routes. Inevitably, you require other players to buy into the families that you have ties with such that money is available for further expansion. In other words, there is a constant push-pull between trying to gain a monopoly on routes and also forging temporary relationships with other players for mutual benefit. I find this interaction bewildering but highly tactical at the same time. One annoying flaw of the game is the somewhat random draw of cards/goods to your hand. With a maximum of seven cards per hand, a few poorly chosen good cards or bad luck can tank your chances of winning the game. This luck driven card selection ought to be mitigated with a more controlled selection process. However, this game likely requires a few more plays before the ratings truly reflect the depths, complexity and re playability of the game.

Feelings after the first play: a bit disappointed and mixed. I have to play again to know for sure, but it felt a bit unrewarding and there was plenty to setup and hasle. Not quite as elegant rule-wise as I was hoping. I was not convinced for some of the design choices (like how joining the families, double building, etc worked). But as said, I would like to to try it out again.

A game I've decided I don't really need to own.  Biggest reason is that it's not that great at 2p.  I love stocking holding combined with route building.  There are other games that do the same thing.  Airlines Europe, while not ideal at 2p, is just better.  So no reason for me to own both.  However, I'd still be willing to play this with 3p or more.  It is a good game.  I just don't need to own it.

A route-building/share "cube rail" game that uses camels instead of trains and disguises shares as marriage into families. Light and quick to play, but strategically interesting despite the potential for luck due to the card draws. Set-up is fiddly but due to short game length, there's opportunity to play a few games once everything is set-up. The game manages to be quite interactive for the short game time (for example, you must keep track of how you expand your routes to avoid giving others easy mergers and you must note who else may have married into your families). Components are fantastic, much as with the other Winsome remakes by Queen. An excellent family strategy game and a good introduction to share games as it's more forgiving than other titles in the genre.

A re-themed Age of Scheme, I like the board spaces over the former hexes.  It's a straight Euro with minimal luck and a train mechanism.  After a few more plays I'm upping my rating.  Other than the initial deal of two cards, there's minimal luck in the game.  I think I'm still going to play with a house rule that initially you're dealt 3 cards and discard one.  IMHO Starting with two cards on opposite corners is a tough position to recover from.  The game doesn't outlast its welcome and about the time it finishes you're wishing for another turn or two which is a good thing.  It has simple rules and plays very fast.  It scaled well with three and four players.  I'm looking forward to both a two and five player game.

I liked this one quite a bit.  A game with a similar "feel" to something like Steel Driver, but very different, and very much more engaging to the casual gamer.  Despite the fact that it has some reputation as a family game, I see it being attractive to my "gamer" group as well.

An "ultralight" stock game (as in the unsafe-at-any-altitude [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultralight_aviation]aircraft[/url]) where, after one play, everyone knows that the best strategy is to repeatedly merge two camel-trains together, both of which are owned by you.  Why?  Because (a) it's worth 8 points at the end of the game, and (b) it provides additional in-game points and a substantial money inflow for initiating the merger in the first place.

So hey, run some camels around, purchase colorful cardboard rectangles, cause sandy mergers, and pull out a win if you get the right cards.

If it sounds more a theme park than a game, you're right, but it's still fun for the 60-90 minutes that you stare at the pretty flashing lights before your mom drags you home and puts you to bed.

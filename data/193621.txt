A whimsical spin-off (of sorts) of [b]Cards Against Humanity[/b].  Pretty dirty, but still room for lots of humor.  I'm more visually-oriented, so throwing down a panel to complete a comic story scratches a nice itch.

None of these stupid "hand in your hilarious card" so-called games have any reason to keep score. Play until you get bored. They also tend to have too much damn downtime for a supposed party game. Burn them all.

RATING: 4
I was very excited for this one but I just haven't gotten the laughs out of this that I had expected. Many cards are extremely similar to one another and many combos feel like they were made with each other in mind not really leaving enough creativity to the players in my mind.

I'll play it if others want to, especially since others really seem to enjoy it, but I won't ask to play, myself.

Kickstarter copy with exclusive expansions. Might sell?

I am not huge on party games. I really like cyanide and happiness. We made some variations to the rules because the game doesn't always work in the intended format. So when we draw a card from the pile the judging player decides if it is the first or second panel. All other players still play the punchline. We find this makes the game much more enjoyable as jokes land more often. I like it more than cards against humanity, but I think it needs some expansions and tweaking.

This is sort of a comic strip building game that works well with 3 players who are looking for inappropriate content. It's similar to something like Cards Against Humanity, but also quite a bit tamer... still not something to play with just anyone though. It's pretty crass and there were moments of entertainment.

Backed on Kickstarter March 2016, estimated delivery Nov 2016, arrived in Oct. Same format as Cards Against Humanity, but you make comic strips. I find it a lot more fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a clever step beyond Cards Against Humanity. The nature of the card combinations also allows much more replayability for the game. The best moments in CAH are when cards line up to create a narrative understood at once by all the players, less so when you just have a laugh at a shockingly vulgar card. The latter situation might be good for a laugh once or twice. The former situation is new every time and allows for more creativity; this narrative combination is what Joking Hazard is all about. I would (and do) own this over CAH.

RATING: 5
Actually a pretty high rating for this type of game for me. Joking Hazard is basically just Apples to Apples, where players play a final frame to a comic strip, with the judge deciding whose punch line he likes best.

The cool part is that the judge gets to contribute to the strip as well. The first frame is a random flip, then the judge adds a second frame from his hand, so there's a chance of the strip making sense from frame 1 to 2.

Overall, good for a few laughs if it doesn't overstay its welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Quite a bit better than I thought it would be, and it seems like it is less likely to wear out it's welcome than Cards Against Humanity.  The rules can be messed around with a little, if necessary.  I like there is a mechanism for getting rid of some of the more useless cards in your hand, without just playing them to get rid of them.  Definitely crude humour, very irreverent, somewhat controversial, very funny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Pretty fun to play and mostly hilarious. Sometimes the comic doesn't make sense, but most of the time, they work well and end up with funny results. A good game, would recommend highly.

RATING: 4
Heyyyy look it's Cards Against Humanity: comic edition. There is something more interesting about the way you have to assemble a comic (and I especially like that the judge uses a mix of a random card + something from their hand to create the setup), but really this is the same largely creativity-free party game experience I don't like. This is still a game where Rando Cardrissian could easily win. That said, I'd rather play this than CAH for the reasons stated above.

I admit when the husband Kickstarted this game I rolled my eyes and thought, "Great, another Cards Against Humanity."

Which to be honest, it is. This is the cartoon/picture version of CAH. The good news is that having pictures adds some more subtlety to the humor, so it can be a bit of fun if you're burned out on CAH.

The downsides are that the first panel chosen won't always work well as an opener, so some rounds are a little sad trombone. And I completely expect this will become as dull for me as CAH is now. But for the time being, it's a perfectly fine party game time-waster.

Have played a couple times now, and already prefer it in almost every way compared to CAH (the game this is always inevitably compared to). While this game does have some of the "shock and awe" humor of CAH, it isn't the only thing that kept us playing. Also since the judge gets to contribute to the creation of the comic (usually), they can help set the tone for what they want to see other people play which has helped make sure there are less "dud" hands. I haven't tried any of the suggested variants, but so far this is one of my favorite games to bust out and casually play while drinking and chatting with friends/family.

Among Apples to Apples and Card Against Humanity style games, Joking Hazard is one of the best. The judge actually contributes to the humor, rather than sitting out the round to award points. We play without the rule where if a red card is drawn as the "first" panel, each player contributes two cards (because then the judge has to effectively sit out that round).

The first apples to apples like game that actually gives players more creativity/expression/choices and for once I found people actually laughing out loud compared to the chuckles that you rarely get in games like Cards Against Humanity.

"Someone on the Internet once told us that making stick figure comics is easy as hell, and that we were ugly and stupid.

They were right on all counts. So, after crying for a few hours, we created the Random Comic Generator which since its inception in 2014 has entertained millions with its computer-generated comedy.

After a few weeks of playing with the Random Comic Generator, we started to wonder if its hundreds of random panels might lend themselves to a card game, where you compete against your friends to finish a comic with a funny punchline. So we printed out all of the RCG panels and started playing with them."

I had high hopes for this game.  It has some very funny cards and combinations, but there are too many cards with no text and too many cards that do not fit.  It plays a lot like cards against humanities (nothing new there) but also gives you an option to trade in cards (which is very helpful when you have a hand full of cards with no text).

Pretty funny. I think the comic panels lend themselves to more replayability than, say, something like Cards Against Humanity because it's all about context. The funny cards in CAH are usually going to win just because of whatever card it is, less so than the card it gets played with. In Joking Hazard, you can make some pretty funny comics out of seemingly unrelated panels for some good laughs.

It's CAH with a comic strip. Or at least has the same humor and scoring base. What shines here is the game offers different versions on how to play, so while like any party game it will get stale eventually, the different modes will add for more replayability than your standard party game.

I don't much find this game funny. It's just full of sexual cards, and many of them feel old, fast. Just looking at the cards I swear my box had multiple of the same cards. While not actually the same, it sure felt like it.

I love the concept, and in big groups, CAH can be fun (and I have a good collection of the cards), I just don't find this one fun nor interesting.

I like it better than CAH, but it is still fresh and new... Having two characters with different color shirts makes choosing your card a slight bit more interesting because some of the cards have a single guy with one color shirt which may not make sense in context. Super light party activity, we had a good time. Like CAH I think this one will come out every now and again at someone else's request but will not be a staple.

Much better than CAH, in my opinion. The judge gets a say in what the joke will be, the cards are nice to look at, and it isn't stale (yet) like CAH. It's not a type of game I play often but I will always prefer this to any other type in this genre.

It is definitely along the same lines as CAH and other games that just don't require much thought, but in CAH even when just needing to get rid of cards there is usually some level of humor whereas with Joking Hazard if your cards didn't really match then it wasn't even partially funny.  I found I preferred one of the variations of the Neverending Comic more.

Awesome party game!  Bigger groups seem to work better and the laughs don't stop.  Sometime with smaller groups, the cards just don't work out well and it can drag a little.  Very crude and not for sensitive people but if you can stand a little dark humour, this one is a winner.
Not a game I would pull out on a regular basis but excellent in the right situation.

If any of these piqued your interest. Then this is a great game.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2018)

I don’t remember why I bought Joking Hazard but when I bought it, I didn’t know it was a game in the vein of Cards Against Humanity and Apples to Apples. I really dislike both games and I ended up disliking Joking Hazard as well.

The rules are uber easy, you can explain them under 1 minute. Playtime can take a long time for such a simple game. It depends a lot of the number of players. It is probably best as a 4-5 player game, with more players, the playtime becomes unacceptable for this kind of game.

The source material was utterly unknown to me, I have seen it occasionally on memes on the internet, but I don’t really know or recognize the cartoons. I confess they are funny and the theme doesn’t bother me in the least.

Gameplay is very boring, it is almost not a game. In each turn a player makes a story and you have to finish it, the big issue for me, is that there is a judge who subjectively chooses the best answer. I hate subjective games, I prefer to play games in which the answer is clearly and objectively defined (like Dixit). There is a ton of luck with the game, many times you don’t have any opportunity when a player plays a superior card for the situation. I get it is a party game and I enjoyed it while I played it, but as a game it utterly fails for me. The best card is obvious, that is, the game has almost no decisions and the few it has are glaringly obvious. 

I know I’m in the minority for disliking the game. Most friends really liked it and I know it had sold a lot of copies, so people must really like it.

Bottom line, Joking Hazard is the latest game in the line of CAH and Apples to Apples. I deeply dislike this kind of game, nor for the theme, but for its execution. It has lots of luck, subjective judging (which I hate) and I never want to play it again. I already sold it. The replayability factor is very low for me.

I could tell you the rules for Joking Hazard, but there is little point since the rules clearly state that if you don't like the ones published, stop being so anal and just make up your own! Each card is a comic panel. First the judge draws one panel from the deck, then adds a panel from their hand to place before or after the drawn panel, and then the other players suggest a final panel from one in their hands. The judge decides which card wins. So, yes, this is CAH with comic panels, with an equal degree of crass topicality.

Okay, so the design is pretty much non-existent. What about the humor? Well, some of the cards and combos can be really funny. Just like in CAH, some rounds will be humorless because of the available cards, sometimes it will be hilarious. You can bet on a fair amount of both kinds of rounds in each game. However, many times people look at their cards and say, "Are there duplicates? I've had these cards before." In reality, I don't think there are dupes, but the differences in some of the cards are so minor, they start to feel repetitive. There are too many cards where they just swapped the expressions of the two characters and left it at that. THIS, more than anything, is really unforgivable. If the main point of the game is to play with comic panels and you have thousands of previously produced panels to choose from, why add so many cards that can be barely told apart in the playing? This is the height of laziness and is truly unforgivable.

A CAH "choose the winner" style card game where players make a comic strip. It's fun from time to time, but the humor is all shock humor and as a cartoonist myself, I find it to be lazy. Even though it's really fun, I knocked it down a couple of points just because I don't love Cyanide and Happiness.

Not sure this is better, exactly, than Cards against Humanity, but it's at least different, and it's possible, though unproven, that hands are a bit more "open" and likely to be won on clever context and juxtaposition rather by obviously "dirty" cards, as can happen in CaH.

It's a good game if you like Cards Against Humanity. I think CAH is a slightly better game. I think JH could be improved by establishing starter panels. Similar to the black cards in CAH. Often we find the first two panels will not lead to an overly funny comic. It's usually fairly enjoyable. Use the Rando Cardrissian role from CAH. Rando is REALLY fun(ny) when used in JH.

Basically like CAH, except with comic panels. I appreciate it as a fun party game, but even then results are often mixed. More often than in CAH do card combinations just make zero sense. But when they do it produces a ton of laughs. So everyone's playing for that one golden moment that happens about once or twice a game.

A refreshing spin on the big group party game.  Everyone seemed to like it... but in the end, it is just an Cards Against Humanity clone (which itself is an Apples to Apples clone) with cartoons.  Bottom line is... its loads a fun and even more fun with Alcohol.

It's another Apples to Apples game, but with terrifyingly offensive jokes.  Probably more offensive than Cards Against Humanity.  Significantly funnier than those other games, though.

Juvenile humor that can illicit some fantastic results. There's something about the crass delivery of Cyanide & Happiness that translates really well into this game. It's similar to Cards Against Humanity and Apples to Apples but a fresh enough take on the concept that it's not tiring. Yet.

In my opinion a better game that CAH that it is often compared to. The card (in general) are less offensive than ones in CAH and so is accessible to a wider audience. Playing 3 cards means that each new comic strip is unique. Sometimes you have the same problem of "None of my cards work here" but I feel it happens less often.

I'm a big Cards Against Humanity fan, and Joking Hazard is the first game to come along that has given CAH some serious competition. It's basically the same idea, except you're making a short comic strip. The judge comes up with the setup, and everyone else competes to have the best punchline. It works really well, and I love the creativity that it inspires. I think there's room for both on my shelf, but Joking Hazard now feels like a good alternative for when I don't feel like playing CAH.

Party game.  Plain and simple.  You are given a hand of cards, you flip from the draw  pile, and then as the judge (czar in cards against of humanity) you play either the first panel in a three panel comic or the second.  Then the remaining players play the third panel. Cyanide and Happiness in all their lewd and gross comedy, leads you down a depraved road of fart jokes, comic bloodshed, and more.  It has been very hilarious, but totally NSFW or Kids.

This is probably a fairly high rating and once I've seen the cards, I'll probably drop it down a point or two, but for now it was my favorite of the "apples to apples" variants. I found this a lot more creative than CAH and more interesting than AtA. It still suffers from the "I have a hand of cards that don't match anything on the table", but it seemed like it happened a little less often.

Not one I'm dying to get back to the table, but if it comes out occasionally during Thanksgiving or Christmas, I will gladly play this over CAH.

It's a slightly novel take on party comparison games and the cartoon panels are surprisingly well executed for modularity...but not well enough to really hold interest.  After a few rounds, the non-sequiturs and dirty jokes get pretty tiresome.  So, I applaud the effort and the intriguing premise, but the final game is boring.

Latest in the "prompt, response and judge" adult-humor games (like Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity) but unlike in those games, I feel the players have more license to be creative because the humor isn't quite as "manufactured" here as it is in those.

Not bad, but not very good either.  If all you play is Cards Against Humanity it's a nice change, but if that type of game only makes it to the table from time to time, I'd rather play CAH.

RATING: 6
This game is fun like Cards Against Humanity is fun. The shock factor of some of the cards is great the first time you see them, but some of the novelty fades. A lot of the fun comes from introducing new people to the game and seeing their reactions. The game is worth playing if you're willing to wait for the few times per game the comics are side-splittingly hilarious. There are some dud rounds for sure, but the game has a mechanic that allows you to exchange all the cards you want when a red-border card is played from the draw pile, which keeps things refreshing.

RATING: 6
The idea of making comic strips is neat, but it is hard for it to always be funny.  Too often instead of a real punchline the most offensive card will win.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So much better than Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples because of the versatility of the cards (no Black vs. White or Red vs. Green), and ambiguity of interpreting comic artwork. Should be called 'Terrence & Philip: The Game". The 2-panel proposal is great, reminds me of The Pledge -> The Turn -> The Prestige. What works for a magic trick is also applicable to an excellent joke.

It's like a 7-8 for the type of game it is in theory, but like most of these, it is a 4-5 at best compared to board games in general, or like the internet. Lots of little laughs, some obscene "never should've existed" laughs, some big, and a lot of awkward "yea, I guess that's funny, kinda.." move along moments.

I feel about this the same way I feel about this whole category of party games pretty much.  I have fun with them for a while and occasionally a really funny moment will happen but for the most part they tend to just go on too long and don't really offer much substance.

This one is much in the same vein of Cards Against Humanity.  A vulgar game with the same scoring of Apples to Apples where the judge picks the point winner each round.  I will say that this one offers a little bit more creativity to the standard Cards Against Humanity formula.  Each round the judge turns over a card from the deck depicting a comic panel then adds to it from their own hand and each other player offers a card to finish the 3 panel strip and the judge picks the winner.

The art is also from the Cyanide and Happiness comic strip so fans of that will probably be even more intrigued than most.

I was a huge Cards Against Humanity fan when the original set first came out, but as the years have passed I find myself enjoying it less and less. When the Kickstarter for JH was announced and started picking up steam, I thought this would revitalize the "everyone throws in a funny card" genre. Unfortunately, it didn't. Playing with people who have previously laughed-till-they-cried during several CAH sessions, this thing went over like a lead balloon. Most likely won't play it again.

The rating is based on ym first play of the game.  The game is a fun (although somewhat raunchy game that reminds me of apples to apples, but can make for some funny combinations.  Definitely not a game for all crowds, which is what holds back the rating, but with the right crowd could be a great time, which keeps the rating fairly high.

The best take on Apples to Apples mechanics.
Comic style brings visual element to the game. It's just more thematic and fun.
Also the cards aren't entirely (mostly, but not entirely) base on shock value like Cards against humanity so it makes for more "profound" gameplay.

Played twice when I first got it, but it's sat on the shelf ever since. It's just not all that funny, and I'll pretty much laugh at anything. There is significantly less scope for imagination than CAH and so the already limited combinations get old much, much faster than that game. I really wanted to like this, but it's just a pretty poor CAH clone.

This game might no be for everyone as it's not very "PC". However, if you're like me and love offensively non-PC funny stuff, this is for you!

We played for hours without even keeping score and even when our friends had left we sat and went through the cards making up funny strips. 

If your not sure if it's for you, check out their website and sample some of their comic strip. If you laugh, then buy this game or find someone who has it!

Backed on kickstarter, as much as I enjoyed CAH it started getting boring.  This is a fresh take on it. Sometimes you just need it drawn out. With over 400 cards it will last but after a few plays it doesn't receive the same wow factor with the same group.  I still love the game and I can't wait for more.

It's funny, I'm not going to pretend we didn't laugh our butts off at some of the wacky card combinations.  But honestly, this just felt like a pale imitation of Cards Against Humanity.  It feels like the same game, only not quite as funny or twisted.  You get a lot of comics that make no sense, and nobody really "wins".  But every now and then you do slap together a gem that makes everyone laugh.

The better version of cards against humanity. Replayability is high, played it various of times and it feels new each time because most cards actually work with each other. Very rarely did I have any cards in my hand that couldn't fit inside the comic. The comics for the most part are brutally hilarious, can be offense, but are definitely funny. This game isn't for everyone, but for me, it's something I'll continue to play quite a lot. Also be warned, this game is not for kids.

Great take on card judging party games. Mint unlike Apples or CAH. I like the comic strip so being able to build my own is great. Sometimes suffers from the usual 'I don't have any good cards!' But most of the time you are able to make some good stuff and the occasional killer joke.

Takes the offensiveness of Cards against Humanity and adds visuals to it. I personally like this one better because in the couple of games I played, it created a couple of funny combinations each time. That's more than you can say from CAH, in which combinations too often don't make a lot of sense.

A party game in the same realm as Cards Against Humanity. This one I find to be more fun since you are putting together a story /comic and not just throwing out random phrases.

Avoid playing this one too often, just like with CAH and Apples to Apples (or games just like them) the fun can run thin quickly.

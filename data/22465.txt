I have the Gamewright version that comes in the way too large box. It's a nice metal tin but could have easily been half the size. I can't see this as being much of a head to head competitive game but it's a fun puzzle to work through and that's most likely how I'll usually play this one.

A very creative puzzle activity (less so a game).  There are some puzzles that are easy to spot and solve.  Then along comes another that will spit you out in a puddle of goo.  You can find yourself convinced that it is not possible.  You will find yourself convinced that there are more than 8 possible orientations for a single card.  Perhaps this is best seen as an activity - in which score really doesn't matter.  Working the puzzles is fun enough.  Not every game needs to be an actual game, right?

An OK puzzle-solving game.  It can get severely bogged down when all the players are straining to solve the same puzzle, and that decreases the fun-factor in my opinion.  It is alright as an occasional filler for puzzle-lovers, but not much of a game.

RATING: 7
A great visual puzzle game. You have to place 4 clear tiles with dots on top of each other so that when you look at them all stacked with dots overlapping each other, it matches the card shown. 

I would rate this higher but my students aren't over the top gun-ho about it. I like it a lot but it could be a bore to those who aren't very visual.

The first couple of plays this seems really difficult, but if you warm up with a few of the easier cards, the manipulation of the transparencies makes much more sense.  Good puzzle game at a good price - also works as a "beat your time" solitaire puzzler.  Not something I'm going to pull out frequently, but a good one when I'm in the mood for a puzzle.  Very compact - another decent game to have around in waiting rooms or restaurants.

RATING: N/A
The box said it contains 16 transparent squares, and that you use 4 to make a pattern. What it doesn't say is that the 16 are actually the same 4 cards repeated 4 times (for multiplayer). So we'll see if this is enough for a challenging solitaire game, or not. UPDATE: So far it's challenging enough that no one wants to play but me -- good thing it's basically solitaire. You must believe it can be done and then stick with it.

The first couple of times you try this out it seems (at least to me) quite difficult to make the patterns on the cards.  However, with a little practice and examination of the four transparent cards it gets much easier.  Like with any speed/pattern recognition game, you have to play with people of the same skill level, otherwise it ends up being a blowout.  With this type of game, I would probably rather play Ubongo, as it's more frantic, and a little more involved.  Still, this is much more portable.  That is, in fact, one of my complaints - why isn't this game in the regular Cocktail Games type box?  There is really no need for the cube - I assume they did so in order to charge more.  The other minor gripe I have is with the transparent cards.  I suppose it's impossible, but from the moment you begin using them they are obscured with fingerprints.

A puzzle game in which the players are in a race to create the dot based puzzle drawn each round by overlapping and rotating 4 transparent cards of their own. Each card only holds certain dots so the players must combine them to get the correct combination and sometimes hide unwanted dots behind other dots on other cards. 

The game definitely begins to click after 10 or so plays and it is fun to see people evolve and adapt to the challenge.

It's no Set, but it's good.  And you do get some adrenaline rush when trying to get the alignment in the nick of time.  On the other hand, the round often goes to the player who just happened to align a couple of cards randomly and quickly and they happened to mesh.

I'll give this game a 6 for originality but I don't enjoy speed games.  It seems that once you get used to thinking as the game requires it will get tedious and will be just a matter of who throws their cards in the right order fast enough.  It's not unlike Set in that regard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Amazing concept, brilliantly executed. Very unique idea that is simple to explain to anyone, although will not be everyone's cup of tea. Do you like SET? There's a certain commonality of feel, but in Vitrail the manipulation of your own "cards" add to the tension (and rounds move faster). It's certainly more noisy too.

Meh...  This kinda reminds me of set.  As much as I like abstract strategy games and race games this game didn't do much for my family.  Perhaps we were distracted.  Perhaps the planets were not properly aligned.  I like the concept and I am impressed by the amount of work that went into creating the game-  but it just didn't go all that well.  Maybe it is just us.  

The quality of the game is top notch.

1 play, Gathering

Each player has the same set of 4 plastic squares with colored dots scattered on them. The deck of cards shows various combinations of visible dots. Players race to put their 4 squares together to recreate the picture on the card, turning and flipping their cards and arranging them in the right sequence such that only the correct dots are visible. The player to solve it first takes the card, worth 1-3 points.

We didn't actually play with points, though -- William was too good! But it was fun. Also nice to know that this is a skill that can be learned -- the rest of us did improve as we played.

Nice filler for the puzzle-lovers!

[Asmodee 'Vitrail' 2006 edition] {Filler; puzzle, real-time; optimal 4p} Vitrails is a nice puzzle game. Players have to master the 4 plastic cards (2 card of each pattern) so that they all overlap and create an image that shall match a target pattern. The tricky part is that you have to 'hide' some dots in order to complete the target pattern. This game is especially good for students to training their logical spatial thinking because it's more cute and stylish than other reaction games. Besides, it's easier to 'realize' the progress in Vitrail. Although it's somewhat solitaire, it's hectic and fun for all players!

Nevertheless, the replayability is low due to the low player interaction and practice effect. IMO, after enough practices, players can have no problem in create target pattern of 3 points.

Like other real-time perception games, it's easy to have a sure winner. However, with players of similar, it is very funny and exciting. I wish that the game was more 'tricky' - players have to choose 4 out 6 of their plastic cards to match the target pattern and the plastic cards are made more asymmetric.

The illustration of the cards is clear and sharp. However, the tin is easy to crush and I am afraid the plastic cards will wear fast.

This is a good try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

[Inspired house rule]
Separate and shuffle the 1, 2, 3 point deck. Each round, turn-over the top card from 1, 2 and 3 deck. Players then compete to build one of the 3 patterns. When any player shouts 'Vitrail', the round halts. Whoever shouts 'Vitrail' first is the winner of the round and takes the corresponding card. Replace the captured card from the corresponding deck. Other 2 cards remain.  Players can leave their transparent cards 'as is'.  Then the winner of the last round shouts 'start' and the next round begins.  Whoever first having at least 10 points and cards from each of 1, 2 and 3 deck is the winner.

[Another house rule]
Turn over 2 targets. Players then compete to build one of the 2 patterns. When any player shouts 'Vitrail', he takes the completed target and replace one from the draw deck. Whoever first gets 9 points is the winner.

*Owned for school - single copy* Wow, this one is pretty polarizing for kids.  I have some students that enjoy the puzzle aspect of layering the cards and some that find it so frustrating that they won't play.  For that reason, I think it's great that this one can be played solitaire.

Some folks have a gift for spatial reasoning or have solved tons of logic puzzles that develop that skill (ahem), and they typically smoke everyone else at [i]On the Dot[/i]. Even if Player A is only 10% better then Player B, Player A has a huge edge since there’s only one card to claim and no prize for second.

The solitaire rules do provide a nice challenge to fans of logic puzzles, but you'll only be increasing your dominance over others. For more details, read [url=http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/game_review_on_the_dot_vitrail/]my review[/url] on Boardgame News.

A party game really - but let down by the fact that only possible for 4 to play.  It plays like First Hand/Hands Up or Set - a thinking cap needed to complete the pattern first.  If more could play, as a party game I would have given it a 10.

RATING: 5
Don't bother corralling a group of "serious" players unless everyone is evenly matched.  Unless you like to win a lot or lose a lot - then by all means, please do.

The family-friendly alternative: Bag the head-to-head competition and continue playing until everyone finishes.

In terms of developing mad dot skillz, there are clear-cut strategies for completing the challenge cards relatively quickly - strategies that everyone should be able to identify after a few plays.  So don't be surprised if you only find a few minutes worth of meat in this cheap appetizer.

Played 10+ times. I enjoy most games of that kind (observation and quickness), so it is no wonder I like this one too. I am not too sure how the points values of the cards have been decided (the most valuable are the ones I find the most easily), but I don't care much for the scoring rules anyway, and play until we are tired of it.

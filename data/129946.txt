Hard to rate because there is so little to it. But taken for what it is, a short, mindless, entirely abstract, dexterity-game, it does provide some thrills. Players flick magnets across the table hoping to attract other magnets and form a chain. If they fail, their flicked magnet is left on the table until incorporated into a chain later. Play continues until all magnets have been removed. And that's it. But the magnets are strong, and nicely shaped, and there is real satisfaction watching your magnet drag other magnets slowly, almost reluctantly, into a chain, netting you a few extra points.

 Tossing hematite magnets about on a table doesn't seem like it would be a great amount of fun. But you are wrong if you think so.

I played this with my son. I beat him by a lot for our first game. But on the second game, there was just nothing I could do but cry as he completely slaughtered me. He watched my strategy of going for the far away magnets first in the initial game, and he did it better than I did for the second game.

You are flicking magnets across a table in the hopes that they pull each other together to acquire them for points... I guess this could be entertaining for very small kids or for breaking the ice with non-gamers. Other than that, it is a repetitive, non strategical game that gets boring after a few plays. 

The only redeeming feature is that the qualities of the magnets are great.

People will be drawn to this (get it?) when it's on your table.  Addictive entertainment.  A strong set of odd-shaped magnets.  Flick one into the crowd and see how many more you can lock on to.  But they also repel each other, depending on orientation, so good luck with that.  So much fun.  When it comes out, it stays out all night, as different groups sit down to play around with these wonderful toys!  They've done a heart-shaped set, too, which are equally fun.

Bought 36 super magnets and now have this game as a homemade version. I just can`t resist the pull of magnets or games containing magnets. Excuse me a second while I have to keep my head away from pointing north all the time. There that`s better i feel polarized already.

Basically marbles, except they'll stay on your table, you don't need perfect precision to hit, and you can try for some slightly esoteric shots using the magnetism. Perhaps the best 2-minute dexterity filler I've seen, though that category isn't large.

I love flicking games, and who doesn't love magnets?  The marriage should have produced a beautiful baby.  Unfortunately, this is another fantastic idea that doesn't quite work as well in reality as I'd hope.  It's not bad, and I still had fun.  But I can't see getting the game and springing it on everyone who will sit still for five minutes (which is where my hopes were).  The problem is the polarity of a given magnet didn't seem to be obviously known by looking at it, so flicking a stone toward another will lead to semi-chaotic results.  In the end, the overall results were then somewhat random, and it didn't leave me satisfied.  Perhaps I could paint polarity indicators onto a set to fix it...

This game likely resulted from seeing those magnet stones and thought about how they could make a game out of them.  Use a shooter marble style and get more to stick together than your opponent.  Having said that, for younger kids, it could be okay -- and at about $10 R&R priced it right.  The stones are flat on opposite sides and nicely rather than randomly shaped so the price is good for the magnetic stones on their own.

This is barely a game and more "fun with magnets."  But it *is* a lot of fun sliding magnets across the table to try and collect other magnets.  Every session has lots of exclamations as magnets interact with hidden metal table elements or simply don't react as you would expect.

Couldn't be simpler to teach, plays in like 3 minutes, then you want to play again. Great for kids as long as they're old enough to not eat the pieces. Scoring system does not even require counting, just stacking and comparing heights. Oh-so-satisfying clacks. Best magnet game ever.

Not sure there's much of a game here but the components are marvelous for only 10-15 bucks you get a quality bag full of really nice, polished powerful little magnets.  I have enjoyed playing with these just as magnets and would pick up another set if I see this game for sale again.

Allready lost the rules. Why didn't they come on a metal plate...

Anyway does exatly what you think it would do.

Lost a 2 player game because opponent was leaving magnets to his site of the table and missing. In the second part he took over. And won by one (13-12). Next time I won't shoot for these anymore...

Great ice-breaker, beer and pretzel game, with a slight dexterity aspect. We played with a couple of sets. Plays quick and is a great little filler or game to break out to introduce new gamers to each other. Not a whole lot of strategy, but fun enough to watch the magnets and laugh with each other.

We played this game with 4 people and it was fun for 2-3 minutes.  The game was never ending.  

You flick magnets into other magnets.  If you attract other magnets to the one you flicked, you acquire them into your points pot.  Problem is sometimes the polar opposites are pushed together and throw them every which way.  When one falls off the table you give up one of your points, I think.

Game was cool, but lasted forever and skill was really not all that important.  Rather play Crokinole!

This is an easy 9 in my collection. We don't always play it, but it's become the go to filler game when we have larger game parties. Quite simply, it's marbles with magnets. It's fun, simple, and frustratingly hilarious at times. At the low price I found it, it's definitely worth a buy. Obviously though, it's a very light, simple game, so if you're looking for depth and long games, look elsewhere.

This is about a 5 minute game. Each set has 25 of those magnetic stones that feel so great to hold (we played with 2 sets). Scatter the pieces. Each player takes one. On your turn, toss/flick/throw your piece from the edge of the table. If any clusters form, take the biggest one and add it to your hand. When others are tossing/flicking, if a piece goes off the table and you catch it with your magnets, keep it! Play until all the pieces have been collected. The player with the largest collection wins!

Fun little game, and I LOVE the magnets!

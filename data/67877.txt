It's a decent game where you need to think up words faster than other players. I'm generally bad at word games, so speed word games just means I'm bad. Also, for some categories, I know nothing (like... Opera or Blues musician... yeah). Also, I think it'll get boring fast, just because some categories don't have that many answers (Oceans, for example). Still, I think people who like fast word games would like this. Just not for me.

Our game nights usually start with a game that I have set up when people arrive. It's usually the longest game we will play. After that we order dinner and sit around trying to decide what to play that is quick enough to not be in the way when dinner arrives. The past couple of weeks Anomia has filled that spot and is well received. I'm actually keeping an eye out for the party edition to get some more variety in the decks in the future.

Anomia is a great party game for when you have at least 4 or 5 people. Im sure there are people who dont like these sort of fast thinking games, but ive never played when every single person laughed their heads off. Im serious every time i play i laugh so hard my jaw hurts. I love that feeling of trying to quickly out think people on the spot. This game is VERY stressful in the best possible way. The only reason i cant give it a 10 is because it ends up being a loud game to play often and as such we cant always play it in my group for respect of the other game store patrons.

Fun little Jungle Speed-esque game. Funny how looking at symbols makes it harder to actually think of the right word for a topic.

This is a hard game to get multiple plays out of in a a day even though it's pretty short - even with two decks of cards, by the time you go to play your third game the first words that come to mind are always the ones that were already used in previous games, so it gets pretty dull in that respect.

Great party game with 4 people.  A simple concept that is hard to deliver under the time pressure.  Who knew it would be so difficult to come up with a random name of an athlete or celebrity on the spot?

Funny note - I had to think of an athlete last night and the first name that popped into my head was Magic Johnson.  Really?  He hasn't played sports in at least a decade and why couldn't I think of any of the hundreds of hockey players I know :)  When faced with the "Celebrity" card, my friend thought of George Burns.  Again...he's been dead for a really long time and that's the celebrity he thinks of first.  LOL it's a funny game!

Fun party game, but loses it's appeal once you start memorizing the categories. Still good to break out once in awhile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty good. After a few plays, having an answer for most of the categories kind of kills any replayability. I prefer the streamlined Set quite a bit better than this, but its still fun. I think the game has some issues like when people run out of cards, draw the same symbol, or draw double symbol cards. The person drawing is always at a disadvantage since all players are focusing on that one players cards, and they need to focus on everyone elses. That said, my brain takes to this kind of thing so I do like it.

:corn: Still not crazy about Anomia but I see its purpose in  a party context. Like all party games, it's as fun as the people around you.

Fantastic party game that feels like an improvement on "Snorta".  The wild cards in the center add another dimension to the game as it's all too easy to forget about their presence right up to the point that your opponent makes you pay for that omission.  Small box, big fun!
Warning:  multiple episodes of brain freeze likely to occur.  Embarrassing example:  needing to name a sculptor, I had a picture of the statue of David in my head, but the only name that came to my lips at that moment was "Mussolini".  ACK!

A really fun group card game.  This game is based around patterns.  When a card is played with a similar pattern as the person sitting opposite you, you get to claim the card by yelling out the opposite shape/color (or something like this...its been a while since I've played and have forgotten some of the particular rules).  It can be a very funny game due to the brain farts people go through trying to think of the opposite thing to say.

This is a category game similar to Quick Wit (or any of the other category games like Scattergories), but with an added pattern recognition element similar to Jungle Speed.

The combination works well together because it having more than two people yell out answers means someone will inevitably not be heard.  Some of the categories seemed poorly chosen, and I did not like the wild cards.  Other than that, the game was pretty solid.

I'm not a fan of party games, and word games fall in the same category for me.
For me, this game was not about winning or losing, more about the interactions which arise when two people are struggling (especially when tired mentally) to find an answer before the other.
Where party games are concerned, there is one question I ask myself:  Did I like it more than [thing=19237][/thing]?
The answer for [thing=67877][/thing] is no.

It's okay, but can be intensely frustrating. The player turning the card is at a big disadvantage, so it's hard to get a card down if you don't have one. This could be fixed by making sure every player has a card down at all times, or by having every player flipping a card at once, maybe by reworking it as a shedding game.

Though it seems to be designed for (and by?) non-gamers, in my experience it's a big hit with gamers (laughter! brain failures! actually quick to play!) and lukewarm for non-gamers (how do wild cards work? wait, why is it my turn?).  And frustratingly, once you've played with the same cards a few times, it becomes way too familiar. Possibly I just need to let more time go between plays.

Super fun and quick looking for and remembering the symbols in front of each player then scrambling to read cards and come up with a viable answer before the other player. Sounds easier than it is. Manic fun, wild cards are a nice twist as well.

RATING: 6.5
One of my favorite party games which can be fun and same time enjoy yelling and talk fast to win!

Players each reveal a card from the deck from the middle of the table away from themselves in front of them. If there were cards with similar symbols players will need to yell out something which relate to the word of the other player's matching card. FOR EXAMPLE if Alex and Michelle each revealed a card with similar symbol and Alex's card says Tropical Fruit, Michelle would need to say something related to tropical fruit, like say Pineapple or Banana. Meanwhile Michelle's card says Celebrity and Alex would need to say something like Michael Jackson or Hugh Jackman or Adele, etc. If one of them yelled out a correct word relating to the person with the matching card, he or she keeps the card and that scores them 1 point. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins!

Very interesting party game. However, be warned and get ready for lots of laughter, screaming and yelling as players will eventually get excited and sometimes it be funny to see your mates get a brain drain from not saying a word hahahahhaha!

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit. Great for finding the Rain Man in your social group.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2014)

What a surprising party/reaction game. Very reminiscent of Snorta and Tarantel Tango but with words! I really liked it. VERY easy to teach and it has a short playtime so I think I will play it a lot in the future. In every duel, the answers are generally easy, but as it a race, it is very fun when a player blurts out wrong answers due to time pressure (for example I was trying to say Golden Gate and said Watergate instead). Lots of laughs.

Really like how the wild cards work making it harder to find if you have to duel or not.

I don’t have anything bad to say about Anomia. The language barrier is an issue with some of my friends, we can only play it when all the players know English, if not the game can be very unfair. I would love to have an Spanish version of the game.

Bottom line, a fun party game and a keeper in my game collection.

One of 2010´s favorites.

Fun game that almost always brings about laughs! Really amazing how the game gives you the feeling of having a word on the tip of your tongue without being able to spit it out!  Doesn't have a ton of replayability once you've learned the cards, but there are suggestions on how to improve that.

It's alright... don't like the randomness of it (someone may have less "conflicts" happening so less chances to win cards)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
After playing a couple times we found we would just revert to our last answer for the same card. Not a ton of replayability (although there are 2 different decks), but the chance to be quick and witty. You could play that you can't use a previous answer from current day. This makes it MUCH better and MORE replayable, although you will tend to use the same responses time and again.

It's not complicated, but this is just fun. Although after a few plays some of the cards become familiar. So you need to play it with different people or I imagine it will become repetitive.

RATING: 9
I was pleased to see that the game works as well in play as it looks on paper.  If you like speed/observation games like Jungle Speed and Snorta like I do, then you definitely need to play this as well.

This solves the main problem with Snorta.  In Snorta you can memorize people's noises and kind of rehearse them in your head as you go around, which puts the person whose turn it is at a disadvantage, since they have to search for the match that everyone else has been waiting for.

In Anomia, I think that all players are on equal footing, since you're not really holding potential answers to people's cards in your mind, ready to pounce.  You try to recognize the symbol matches, then switch to their category, and then your brain often freezes.  The wild cards in the middle add to the fun.  The cascading matches caused by revealed cards (like in Fast Food) are a lot of fun too.

Update: July 2013 - Time to revise my rating. This is always a hit whenever we play it. It's definitely the best game of its type. Up to a 9.

To play, draw and reveal a card from the center pile. Does the symbol on your card match one on another player's card? If so, you must quickly face-off with the other player by giving an example of the person, place, or thing on his card before he can do the same for yours.

The biggest problem with this one is the lack of variety. I've played it enough that I recognize all of the cards so the same answers are often given from game to game. And there are some cards for which players tend to only have one answer period.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Dead simple, instant party game success!

The game is nothing but a deck of cards with subjects and symbols. Players reveal cards from the deck one at a time to reveal a symbol/colour and a subject (e.g. Baseball team, cartoon character, vegetable). When two players have a matching symbol they must quickly name an example of the subject written on their opponent's card. It would be exceptionally easy to list dozens of examples for most of the subjects given the leisure of time, but under the pressure of a "face-off", naming even a single cartoon character can sometimes prove difficult. Upon winning a "face-off" the winner takes the loser's top card as a point, uncovering the subject underneath it. At times, this can lead to what the game calls a "cascade" as a match might appear as the cards from players' stacks become uncovered.

The groups I've played it with and the groups I've seen playing it have all enjoyed it immensely. It also conveniently comes in a small box, so it's highly portable.

Very fun party game or filler. I only played with four, but I can see how this could get really crazy with five or six.

Unfortunately, it's not the sort of thing you want to play over and over, because you will memorize set answers to the categories (i.e. "Rock Opera" will always be "Tommy").

The price is a bit high for two decks of cards and limited replay value.

For me, it is a definite 6 as this is right on the definition of an "OK game. Some fun or challenge at least. Enjoyable in the right circumstances." I can imagine playing this with non-gamer friends and have a good laughs, but the game is really nothing more than a very casual, time-killing filler with board gamers. Good for parties but not a top notch party game design either.

Jungle Speed meets...some kind of trivia.

Everyone flips over cards in front of them.  On the cards are one shape, and one word (insect, animal, show, book, president).  When on the table to shapes match exactly, the people with the matching shapes look at the OTHER persons' card and screams an example of whatever the card is.  Whoever wins the duel, gets the card.  Sometimes this leads to cascades, where the card that is newly revealed (under the winning card) now matches a different card!

A fun drinking game where everyone kind of needs to pay attention for awhile.  Lots of fun all around.

This is a good quick clever party game for 3 to 6 players.

This game isn't about knowing trivia, or about being creative. This game is about being fast and flexible with each card flip at being ready to challenge players one-on-one (when 2 card symbols match) for you to name something within the new category before that person names something in your card's category. There is tension. There is humor.  

Better than Apples to Apples IMO.

A quick little game that tests "observation reflexes" as opposed to physical ones or any sort of knowledge.  Kind of cute, and much more of a warm up.

I just bought this game, what, a couple of weeks ago. There are only 3 of us here and we played it multiple times in a row, we liked it so much. But, we made up our own rule: if in a previous game you've already used that word/name as an answer, you'll have to find something different to say! This way, it keeps others from using the same answer every time it's their turn to shout out the answer.

There's a speed element which I'm bad at, but it's a quick fun game. The game lacks replay value as you develop stock answers, and once you do, there are better speed games available. But it's fun to play from time to time.

While not wildly exciting, this game fits a niche for fast-paced word games for larger groups. The one issue I can see with this is having the same answers for the same categories coming up after a few plays. It becomes more a game of memory than creativity.

*Sold as a little bit limited for me.

A surprisingly fun game.  Everyone I played with enjoyed it, from the casuals to the seriousm gamers.  Even my 10 year-old son couldn't stop talking about it after watching the end of our game.  I love game designs like this that are brilliant in their simplicity, taking an easy to understand idea and giving it a clever twist or two.  I guess you can say we all came down with a serious case of Anomia.

This game favors the quick, and the experienced players will almost always win by a substantial amount. Probably best suited for a group that regularly plays not mixed groups of experienced and new. (maybe a handicap would fix my issues with the game)

RATING: N/A
the game is well conceived, it would rate higher if I really liked this kind of thinking but as it is I would still be happy to play it. the main challenge is coming up with the right words under time pressure much like 10,000 pyramid or password. However the wild card symbols will throw you off as well as the rapid fire follow up that happens when a match reveals another card. It's fun, its difficult, it's kind of different. It feeds a niche, I dont love it, but I like it.

Just alright.  The gameplay is fast perception based card drawing much like in Jungle Speed.  Which some players get frustrated with as its a skill some have and others do not, that combined with the wild cards makes perception speed even more necessary.  The verbal element adds a fair twist to the game, but rather than being trivial or knowledge based its considerably more speed based.  Speed of eyes and speed of tongue are required to win.

Anomia is a fun party game that our neighbors keep borrowing. But once you're familiar with the categories on the cards, you can have your answers ready.

One rare party game where everyone is always involved from start to finish, creating tension, fun and laughter.  The simple word-challenge system creates some entertaining chain reactions, and is understood within seconds.  Elegant, intuitive, straight-forward design.

Must take drink-breaks between rounds or your sweat glands will explode.

Weird gaming experience. Easily the most and hardest I've ever laughed during a gaming session I didn't enjoy. You would be forgiven for mistaking my behavior for pleasure. There were so many funny mistakes, but, for all that, I found the game so anxiety induced that I was couldn't really enjoy myself. I hate being on a hair trigger for long periods of time in games. I can occasionally stomach a game of jungle speed, but even that gets old quick for me.

The gameplay in this reminded me quite a bit of Snorta, but I was hoping it would be a bit more "grown-up" since you were working with categories instead of animals.  It was fun, but there were times when people wouldn't have any cards left in front of them (as opposed to Snorta where you always have your animal) and so weren't always participating. Once this happened, it was actually kind of hard to get back into the game since you had to be watching everyone else's cards when you turned over your card, and the rest of the group was just watching you for a match.

I know a lot of people like this as a party game but I don't think in the way this game moves. I'm not saying its a bad game but I cannot think about shapes and categories and topics all at the same time. If you are a good multi tasker you might enjoy this game just don't ask me to play it with you.

RATING: 8.5
Similar to Scattegories in that you have to think quick on your feet and name something - but you only have to name one, there's no listing involved. I really enjoy the cascading effect, that is how I got most of my points. Should be played with people of similar age and expertise (I felt bad for the 12 year old having to "name 90s boy band") but generally the variety of categories makes it an even - and fun!- playing field for all. Really loved it. Fast, easy to explain, easy to play, light, a great starter game for a session or filler between games/when waiting for players.

Eigentlich eine nette Idee, aber leider funktioniert es nicht gut, weil ständig alle gleichzeitig rufen und es dann schwer ist, einen Gewinner festzustellen. Pures Chaos. Außerdem ist es schwer, alle Karten zu überblicken. Vielleicht ein Spiel, dass online besser funktionieren würde, weil man dann einen besseren Überblick hätte? Aber dann würde der Lag stören, also auch nicht das wahre...

Less outrageously funny than other Munchkin sets, but at the same time it's also fairly thematic and you can tell they did their research on R.E. Howard's universe. As for the gameplay, it doesn't deviate much from core fantasy Munchkin.

Most gamers know the Munchkin drill - love it or loathe it - and this set is re-skinned with Robert E. Howard's world. Nothing major added to the gameplay, but when the theme matches the spirit of the game so concisely, coupled with a well-rounded set of cards, I think it counts as a 'win'!

I like the humour (everyone has to speak in an Arnie accent with my game) but this, like many of the recent munchkin seems to have too much +4 items. Everything is +4. And all the races and special abilities appear to allow everyone to use everything!? The original muchkin was more balanced! 

But didn't have Conan...

The rulebook for this is terrible. The game makes no sense and you definitely have to read a few FAQs to get the overall picture. Mechanically....face it, there are no mechanics here! ;P 
It can still be fun with younger people or if you just want to be silly with friends who don't mind adding a ton of numbers every round.
Overall, I would say it's 'meh.'

At first I kind of liked Munchkin. It was fun and whimsical. I now see the error of my ways. Munchkin is a game where you draw cards and see what happens. That's okay sometimes, but what usually happens in Munchkin is that the game devolves into infinity as no one ever quite reaches level 10 without someone stopping you. Realizing that, one usually resorts to king-making.

Munchkin is simply a game that you cannot get better at. Stuff happens - too bad for you.

Still the Conan theme is fun and some friends like it so I'll keep it around.

Card art is very good. You either embrace the madness of munchkin or shun it. There is no middle ground.

Charming illustrations by Kovalik and amusing tongue-in-cheek humor, but the game ceased to be enjoyable once I discovered Euro games which made me more critical of how I spent my leisure time.

Zdecydowanie gorsza edycja niż podstawowy Munchkin, karty straciły charakterystyczny klimat i humor poprzednika. Mechanicznie jednak to wciąż ta sama, świetna gra.

RATING: 2.5
very random. No meaningful decisions. Also very long for what it is. If it would play in 15 minutes it would be bearable. but this way I really do not like it.

Theme alone is not able to overcome these issues.

Quite possibly the least balanced of the munchkin expansions. The only saving grace is the art which is among the best of the entire series. However, there are so many bonuses in this set that players will often find themselves essentially untouchable after character creation. I have seen several rounds wherein freshly-drawn characters have fighting ability in the high teens. It's a race to 10th level but there's little you can do to impede your adversaries.

Good old Munchkin! Maybe sticks a little too close to the original flavour since both the original setting and this one are fantasy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Captures the flavor of sorcerers and summoning versus barbarian might pretty well.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Parsival

Why we culled it: I'm a sucker for Conan stuff, but not enough to collect it arbitrarily. Munchkin is a game that has its place, and it is a fine fit for particular groups. My group is not such a group, and we find that the game is a classic example of something that is fun for 15 minutes built into a structure that takes way too long to resolve. By the time we've chewed the flavor out of a game, we've only just started the phase where we need to start ganging up on the leader for another hour or two. This found a happy new home with a group that loves it, so my work here was finished.

As an avid Conan fan i am a bit biased, and the only mechanically new thing in this game are the birthrights, but all in all it's excellent.

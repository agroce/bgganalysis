1st play: This game is a lot better than I expected.  There were some weird rules questions that we have to work out, but the game is very thematic.  I really got a feel for how hard it must be to get ships off the surface of Earth and how much planning goes into place to work out logistics for space travel.  I enjoyed it, and I even learned the name of the Russian space dog "Laika"

2nd play: I really enjoyed my second play of this.  It took a ton of figuring out and optimizing.  Everything came down to the wire and we ultimately got our spacecraft to land on Venus and return, which was an awesome sense of satisfaction.  The problem was, our astronaut died of radiation poisoning while in flight (Meaning we rolled a 1 on a d8).  Very anti-climatic.  I'm not sure how many replays of this game I'm up for though, because each play will end up being about the same other than random card draws and things which I won't have control over.  I would rate the quality of this game as an 8 or a high 7, but in terms of eagerness to play again, I feel like I've mostly explored the system.

RATING: 8
Only played solo so far.

Beautiful and simple game mechanics that give rise to an intense and interesting game.  The core of the game is risk management and logistics planning. 

You research technologies, and for each technology you acquire gives you three random outcome cards. When you use the technology you reveal one random card that tells you if you succeed or not. For each revealed card you have the option to pay to remove it. Lets just say that removing all possibilities for failure for you larger expensive and oh so explosive rockets will be one of your top priorities.

To score victory points you complete missions, like putting a man on the moon or sending a probe to mars. To complete a mission you need to buy components like capsules, landers, and rockets. Then you need to get things to where you're going and even getting things into orbit takes a rather large rocket and the longer journey you're planning for the bigger rockets you'll need. And the bigger rockets you have for later parts of the journey the bigger rockets you will need to lift everything into space, resulting in an extremely intricate logistics puzzle.

So far I love everything about this game, from the anxiety of lifting expensive spaceships into orbit using untried and possibly  dangerous rockets (don't even mention the risk to the astronauts) to the planning and execution of the journeys. I have only played sole yet so my observations are mostly about solo play.

Don't play this game with people who have analysis paralysis. There are so many ways to plan your journeys and so many different combinations of tried and untried components and decisions along the way that you'll risk considerable downtime.

Bring at least one calculator to the table, it speeds things up, at least for me. The planning sheets include in the expansion will probably help as well.

Try a few solo games before you introduce new players to the game, the rules really falls into place when you have run through a few plays.

The game takes a bigger table than what it looks like, specially when people start adding up more and more technologies.

When planing longer journeys thank goodness for ion engines. You'll understand why when you will have played the game.

There's an expansion adding the outer planets to the mix, my head hurts even thinking about aiming farther than venus of mars.

I'll probably write a proper review when I have a few more games under my belt, games with real people that is and not solo plays.

OK, so this game can occasionally devolve into twenty minutes of people doing basic arithmatic before coming out of a zombie-like trance, lookign up, and saying "wait... whose turn is it?" but I still really like it.

Yes, it takes too long for what it is, and yes, it's got all sorts of silly little inconsistencies (who would EVER recreate Apollo when you can do it all at a fraction of the cost with just one astranaut, a Vostok and an Eagle), and yes, even though it's basically glorified solitaire, solo play is markedly harder and less fun than multiplayer play... but I still really like it.

It's Kerbal Space Program: the board game, with a great reserch system and really, realy pretty cards. What's not to like (apart from all the stuff above)?

RATING: 8.5
This is a really unique and fun game. I have only played it solo, but on the Very Hard difficulty it can provide quite a challenge. You need to use your budget to plan missions, try to improve technologies, and complete objectives before time runs out. There is a wonderful push your luck element with the way technologies work, and some fun planning/calculations to execute missions. This can range from fairly easy for a 1 way trip with a probe, to extremely complex with a return journey involving docking/separating equipment along the way. Very unique and fun with wonderful art and a fantastic theme. Highly recommended!

Great theme, cool art. Still, it sometimes does feel less like a board game and more like some big mathematic puzzle. Probably 80% of the game is simply calculating the mass and thrust combinations. The rest is some risk managment. If you are in the theme, that´s fine, for other people it´s probably awful. In addition, I´m not sure about the replayability of the game...after a few games, you´ll probably simply know at least the main missions. 
I love the theme, so I definitely can recommand it!

Really impressed with my first play.

The unpredictability of the Outcome cards adds a lot of realism to the game - new technologies/advancements are more likely to fail early in their development, but as more resources are poured into that advancement, they are more likely to succeed later on when the kinks have been worked out. But that's not to say that a fluke won't happen and the new technology succeeds the very first time it is tested only to fail later on, which turns out to be the more likely outcome until more funds are spent on that advancement.

I also enjoyed the room for creativity while planning missions. For example, my initial plan was to complete all the objectives I would need to win all in one flight with a massive spacecraft with tons of rockets but then realized later on that it would be more efficient to use two separate crafts aimed at different missions. Right out of the gate my first spacecraft exploded as it attempted to go into Earth orbit. That was humbling and made me realize how important it was to "test" the advancements and "work out the kinks" before putting tons of resources in a craft in which none of its advancements had even been tested.

But as dumb luck would have it, I forgot to put the supplies on my second craft which lowered its mass enough that I could actually accomplish my original plan with what would have been inadequate thrust had I remembered to load the supplies on board. And despite how risky it was to go to an extra location with a manned spacecraft made of largely untested technology, the Outcome cards came up successes when I needed them to!

Yes, just really impressed how realistic a lot of the game elements became as the game progressed - many things that I didn't realize from simply reading the game instructions. It also gives me an appreciation for how many years it actually takes scientists and engineers to develop, test, and ultimately successfully implement new technologies on a more advanced level.

I highly recommend for anybody that has any interest in space travel and doesn't mind doing a bit of math. =]

UPDATE: Just finished my third play, and I love this game! Looking forward to trying out the expansion. =]

This is like a math-exam.
No it actually is even more calculating that that.

But, boy, did I enjoy Leaving Earth.
It is beautiful. It is a pretty smooth design. It is thematic as it could be.

Everything is well designed. You do research?
Ok cool, but you still don't know your stuff so there might be a good chance that your rocket will blow up. But with every use you will clear that mistakes and become safer in using it. Cool? Cool.

My only negative is the component quality.
Not the markers, they are custom cut wooden bits. Pretty cool.
Not the artwork, which is stellar.
But the cards: way to flimsy. The cardstock is pretty bad.
And my biggest complaint is the box.

The game box is designed like a shoe box. So the lid doesn't close tightly.
The next thing is the label which is some sticker bandarole. So to open the game you have to cut through the box art. Pretty bad designed.
Lumenaris, please, design a proper box for this game. It deserves it.

Not bad! For High Frontier fans, this is more than just a remix of that game, although there are obvious similarities. But Leaving Earth has its own district angle, with testing and risk management decisions that High Frontier doesn't really address. Missions actually aren't that much less difficult to plan, with some missions actually be more complex than their High Frontier counterparts. Not as scientifically curious or deep as HF, but it does what it does well. Stick to 1-3 players, start on Normal difficulty, then move on to Hard right away. Some missions, especially the Life ones, are a little sketchy.

Rules are decent but not great. It takes some mucking about with the game to figure it out.

Anyway, I enjoyed my game, but I don't know if it has a ton of replayability. Still, good impressions, and the physical design is excellent.

Smart, card-based game of space agency risk management. Plays smoothly, looks fantastic, quality components.

The mass times difficulty equals required thrust calculations give it a suitably satisfying planning core. 

Then the gamble, and tension, around whether your rocket survives burns, docking, landing and re-entry manoeuvres keeps play vibrant and interesting.

This one hooked me immediately, but it was quite a few games in that I realized how to  play well. The amazing thing about this game is that it manages, through a few cards and one (exceptional) mechanism, to create a vivid narrative and palpable tension. If you don't enjoy mental arithmetic, not your cup your tea. Otherwise, this one needs to be picked up by a major publisher and distributed more widely. Exceptional.

+ superb narrative building
+ exceptional and unique risk management mechanism
+ elegant and highly thematic
+ works very well as both solo and multiplayer
+ easy to learn and explain
+ high educational value
+ well-balanced

= makes you practise your mental arithmetic (or resort to pen and paper)

- the components have charm but could use some overhauling

This is the game that I would have lost my childhood too, had it been around when I was growing up around the time of the moon landings. It recreates the thrills and setbacks of the space race, with simple game mechanisms for achieving the game goals. Requires some elementary maths (multiplication) to calculate the payloads that can be carried on your rocket(s) based on the rocket's thrust. A genuine 'boutique'-style game with a retro 50s/60s/70s feel (the font type used in the manual is typical of government manuals/blueprints of the time depicted). Highly recommended if you want to go into space! (or just enjoy an intelligent game).

I have such mixed feelings about this game.  First, it's absolutely beautiful - the art and design are amazing.  Second, it's quite cleverly designed, as I've noticed that the math often works out just right, so clearly a lot of thought has gone into balancing the numbers for rockets and manoeuvres.  

But...

It's kinda tedious.  First, most of the game is doing calculations: you look at the missions, design a space program, math it all out and figure out what you need to buy and research.

Then there's the testing, which is also tedious (and yes, you can skip testing altogether if you want to be risky, which I'll come back to in a moment).  The $25/turn also affects the tedium, especially for testing Saturn rockets that cost $15 each.  A turn becomes "buy rocket, test it, pay $10 to remove success."  Great, it moves quick, but it's boring.

Actually executing a mission is satisfying, but in a way that just proves that your math is correct (and that your suspicion that your outcome deck is full of successes is correct).  You've already done the hard work in designing the program.

Where it becomes a game, and where I think I bail out, is in the optimization.  You want to do this faster than other players (or, in solo, fast enough to do other missions).  I really don't like this kind of exercises (e.g. Russian Railroads) as it doesn't change the feel of the gameplay, it just makes you think up a more optimal path.  

Are you clever enough to pre-plan a rendezvous or two?  Or do you want to be risky and fly without testing?  I don't really find these questions that interesting, though.

(Maybe it's my background as a mathematician, not an engineer.  If I already have a solution, I don't care about finding a better one)

One bit that really surprised me, though, was the conditions on the planets themselves.  I had an initial plan of landing a man on the moon and bringing him back, but an earlier probe mission found the moon to be a sea of dust that I could not land on.  So I had to change to a different plan, which was interesting... but it also made me throw out and re-do all of my homework :(

The more advanced missions to Venus and beyond require LOTS of calculations, as you need to do staged missions, rendezvousing with previous missions to collect rockets and ion thrusters.

I just don't see how all of these calculations make for a game.

I don't think I would inflict this game on any other human, especially not any I know, and I think as a solo game I am comfortable saying "neat," and moving on.  Mage Knight's puzzles of how to use your hand the best are far more interesting than this piece of beautiful math homework.

Overall, this is a solid game on space exploration with excellent presentation and nice streamlining.

However, as one player has pointed out, there's definitely some gamey stuff that can happen as a result of all this streamlining. Things like overly reusable components, the ability to change mission goals and/or develop tech mid stream, and the ability to send astronauts on one-way missions all add up to some wtf moments. That, combined with the disparity in VP of the missions and the automatic successes that are possible, and I think I will always prefer [i]Liftoff![/i] to this.

That said, I think you could easily house rule some of the issues with this game. I would definitely play with a $5/$10/$15 payout for easy/medium/hard missions in the future, otherwise no one will attempt the easy missions early. We may also play with every mission face up and just let players choose what they want to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My idea of an epic space game.  Leaving Earth is mechanically and thematically unique, and strikes the right balance between thematic realism and simplification for the sake of gameplay.  Most board games reward good planning, but in Leaving Earth good planning is not optional, it is required.  This is the only game with which paper and pen are used to be sure that all planning is accurate.  Simply working out how to accomplish each mission is a fun mini-puzzle on its own, but the risk management involved creates real tension in the game.  At the same time, even when missions fail due to random bad luck, you still get satisfaction from knowing you theoretically solved the puzzle.

I disagree with the BGG recommended player count that indicates solo is ideal.  This game really shines when multiple players are racing for the different objectives.  Without the race element, generally all risk can be avoided and the game becomes mostly calculable.  That being said, Leaving Earth is so compelling of a puzzle that it was the first game I craved enough to play solo.  Downtime can be an issue with more players depending on how quickly people are able to do their calculations, though players can work on calculations for future missions while waiting on others.

The artwork is gorgeous.  The components are mostly comprised of various sized cards, all of good quality, and the game occupies as much table space as Mechs Vs Minions despite coming in a box less than 1/10th the size.  The only component complaint is of course the paper money.

Simulated space program, played cooperatively or competitively, racing to achieve specific goals laid out at the start of the game. Players spend a yearly budget to research missle and systems tech (rendezvous, life support, etc), before testing those techs and eventually completing the intended missions. Pretty neat simulation without being too complicated, although some of the harder missions do require multi-stage planning to get all materials into orbit and assembled.

One solo play, missing the winning condition by two points.  It's pretty crushing to get everything ready just to have the spacecraft blow up, destroying all of your work.  I think you clearly need to start off with the minor missions just to get through the failure cards before you invest in the huge missions.

Leaving Earth isn't a stellar design but it is a very pleasant game. The graphic design is really strong and helps the whole package come together. A lot of the game is about planning your rocket launches which involves doing pen and paper calculations. These are a little tedious but fit in the grand scheme of things thematically. My favorite bit is planning strategically to try and complete the objectives which are randomly selected. There is also a bit of light exploration for an interesting twist to make each play different

This game is such awesome fun.  It abstracts the space race into an accessible package.  You still need to do some long calculations and mission plans, but it's not so complicated as to be un-playable.  The art style is great as well.  The wooden ship markers are based on real-world space craft and look nice on the cards map of the solar objects.

Each game has turned into a tense affair as multiple agencies bear down on the remaining objective after repeated failures and aborted launches.  I can't recommend this game enough for space-enthusiasts.

RATING: 6.5
Liked: very evocative of the theme and looks great on the table. Simple mechanisms with lots of flexibility allows players to experiment with different approaches. Can be some good competitive tension as multiple agencies go after the same mission.

Did not like: lots of mental arithmetic required. Lots. Not my forte. You could use a planning sheet if you prefer to do your homework on paper. End game could be quite underwhelming, there aren't many points on offer and if it's clear that you aren't in the running for one of the big missions there's basically no point continuing. The testing of spaceship parts is quite gamey, you can send a spacecraft off to Mars with untested gear,safe in the knowledge that you'll be able to perfect it by testing different copies of the technology before it gets there. 

Current thinking: glad to have played it, but a bit too much like hard work to be honest. If someone created a mission planning app that helped you tinker with options without doing and redoing the maths, that would be great, but I'm also not sure how much game would be left.

Very enjoyable solo as a planning focus game. You get to work out the missions at your pace and focus on success. It is still a challenge. The multiplayer game though feels like a real space race. We were taking risks before perfecting the technologies to try and beat the other players. Lots of laughs. Lots of stranded probes and damaged landers all over the inner planets. It is not nearly mathy as some say when you use the charts. It did take failing several missions my first game to get a good hold of the concept.

Reminds me a lot of Kerbal Space Program (PC Game), in that you plan missions and build ships stage by stage.

This game has potential failure though which KSP doesn't, it is thematical and is done in a good way, eg. when first learning a new technology, it is unwknown whether the first few uses of the tech will by a succcess or failure, if it fails you can spend money to stop that failure card from being reshuffled back into the (~3 card) deck. As a result it is advisable to test newly aquired tech on cheap launches before building massive ships and sending them on missions.

As a card game implementation this game does a fantastic job in a small box, and for what it is is an excellent solo game, possibly fun as a 2player too? but there is a lot of mission planning time so the downtime between turns is potentially horrendous!

KSP however does everything that this game does and more, you get to design the ships down to a lot more detail, launch and then fly them, and thus is much more satisfying. One caveat with KSP though is that building very large ships and flying fuel efficient ships around the solar system can take many hours!

I don't like the box setup [i]at all[/i]. I don't terribly mind the shoebox styling, but I don't like the label being used to keep the lid on, and me having to cut the label (poorly) on my own. But I imagine it was done this way to keep production costs down. Instead of printing a whole box, you print a label. And instead of shrink-wrapping the box in horrible plastic, you use the label. Ok, I get it and I agree with it, but I still don't like it.

The cards in the box are shipped in re-usable ziplock bags, not in shrink wrap. Thumbs up for that.

And [i]HOLY COW[/i] this is a good game!

Excellent game. Full of long term planning and press your luck with outcome based card play.  I'm not sure if this is a game for more than one player, because it will bring out the worst AP in players.  I've only played it solo so far and have enjoyed it. Takes up lots of table space. Math is not that bad.

Very good brain burning game. Components are of nice quality and design. Artwork is beautiful and thematic. Rulebook concise and well written. There is a opportunity for expansion, and I hope Luminaris develops one. There are a few things that need clarifying, but I think a player aid could hash it out. One thing that confused me while developing a plan to reach a destination was the fact that rockets can be payload and not active rockets (rendezvous attempts). Also samples can return to earth without probe or capsule. I think a payload card could help.

One solitaire play, and I am seriously considering playing again right now. Very cool game! The planning required seems like it will be intense when going for manned Mars missions, etc....in fact, I did end up playing it again immediately. I could see this becoming a staple in my solitaire game plays very soon. Absolutely amazing 2nd play - the harder difficulty makes it much more challenging (all the better for solo games). Very compelling game (solo at least)!

RATING: N/A
Absolutely stunning presentation; feels like the boutique version of an indie game. Card stock is a bit flimsy, and laser cut masonite pieces aren't quite as substantial as I'd want from a meeple-like solution, but everything is of excellent quality nonetheless.

The theme is fascinating, and really integrates well with the gameplay. While trying to accomplish the missions at hand, there is a feeling that you are progressing year after year, testing and upgrading your technologies and finding their faults. Or conversely, you can rush into space and take your chances that elements of your ship will become damaged - or worse yet destroyed entirely.

Having said all that, and I really am enamoured with this game, I have my doubts that I will be playing this in any fashion but solitaire. There is a tremendous amount of math necessary on the turns that you perform maneuvers. Figuring out a solid plan that allows you enough thrust to complete your multi-part mission requires a substantial amount of "what ifs". It's entirely possible that there would be enough time to figure out your own equations during the downtime of other players' turns - but I can foresee it dragging out uncomfortably while everyone explores all of their options prior to launching their crafts. Hopefully, over the course of further solo plays, I can figure out some kind of shorthand to help alleviate some of the math. For myself the theme and presentation would be enough to look past it, but I don't know that my group has the same passion.

Above all, [i]Leaving Earth[/i] has given me reason to look deeper into the Luminaris catalogue as it's a substantial and well crafted game.

RATING: 7
Pen-and-paper calculations meet risk management. An interesting solitaire experience. Which missions do I aim for? Which advances to purchase? Do I test my components to make sure that they don't fail or do I risk failure and start missions immediately? I wonder how this translates into a competitive game. The focus will shift from an optimization exercise to a luck-driven race of taking calculated chances. I can't imagine playing this with a full complement of four or five players. Explaining the planning to other players sounds like a serious chore.

The artwork is outstanding. Possibly the best-looking game in my collection.

RATING: 4
I’m looking at this game from the perspective of a solo player, because I don’t think that the nature of the game lends itself to playing in a group. And, although I really, really, really wanted to like this game, I’ve not found anyone I’d want to suggest this game to.

The game includes a sizeable element of chance, both in that the missions you are assigned are drawn at random, and also in that at many points there’s a good possibility that something will break. The missions you draw may fit together well, or they may be diverse, and a great deal hinges on that draw - and it’s easy to see that this would be particularly true if you are playing against others.

Like the game, the rule book is idiosyncratic. It starts with a lesson on rocketry, introduces the player to a few of the cards in the game, starts by encouraging the reader to place out a few cards, and uses that to demonstrate that to get a payload somewhere, you also need to lift the rocket out of a gravity well, or accelerate it, and that in itself takes thrust. But then the text wanders off, leaving you alone with your few cards, feeling like a bit of an idiot. You can tell that the designer is earnest, and really wants to teach you stuff, but is a bit too caught up in his own game to know how. 

The rule book follows this lesson with a chapter on setup, followed by a chapter on missions, and a chapter on how the game cycles through years. It is not until the end of this fourth chapter, on page 16, that we find out how the game ends. And that description is disappointingly underwhelming:

“Years continue,” it tells us, until one of these happens: you reach the end of 1976, a player cannot be beaten, or there are no more missions. “At the end of the game,” it says, “the winner is the agency with the most points.” 

This lack of anything particular to accomplish makes the game feel like an character-building but aimless and laborious trudge through a plowed field to somewhere in the middle. Bit like the space race itself, then.

The game play is dry, focused mainly on planning and calculation. 

The first calculation involves the selection of missions. Out of the random set I’ve drawn, how can I effectively and efficiently achieve at more than half the available victory points? 

Having selected the missions, much of the rest of the game is spent working out how much thrust I need to accomplish a given mission, and then working out how to put that thrust together in the most effective way, given that each rocket provides thrust but also adds mass. To get that thrust I need the technology (called “advancement” for some reason) to build a given rocket. If it’s not developed yet, I’ll need to have enough money to pay to develop it, and that may mean waiting for my allocation of money at the start of next year.

There’s no tension in the game, really, except that at each step you are confronted by the possibility that your plan may be thwarted by an accident. If the accident causes a mission to fail, it’ll quite probably remove any possibility of success, but in other cases it might just be yet another hiccough.

Some aspects of the simulation are just odd. For example, why does it take several rockets, possibly of different kinds, to put a payload where you want it? That doesn’t correspond to reality, and if the game isn’t much of a game, doing this makes it less of a simulation, too. There must be better ways to abstract the delivery of thrust than by adding diverse and sundry rockets together. Stages, perhaps?

Some of the mechanics of the game are counter-intuitive. As an example, it costs more to discard a “success” outcome than a partial or major “failure”. I don’t understand how that contributes to the game, since the player has to get rid of all three outcome cards sooner or later anyway, and I haven’t been able to work out any parallel in the real world.

I don’t really understand the need for players to take turns, rather than to play simultaneously. Hours spent watching someone humming and hah-ing about what to do, and adding numbers and multiplying things, is not really high on my list of experiences that I want a game to provide.

Played this with one opponent and can definitely see how your better off just playing this by yourself. Love the theme, and I enjoy High Frontier--well sometimes. But this felt sort of stale. I can't imagine playing with more than three players, especially trying to teach new players. It's quite mathy and puzzly but unfortunately suffers from too much luck in the cards. Ending is anti-climatic. Just as you're about to send off your first rocket on it's first mission, an opponent snags a high victory point objective right beneath you and there's no coming back from that. The game would benefit to block, attack opponents. So great theme, poor gameplay.

This game is simply great. Even though I just played against the time (rounds), I felt like I was part of the race into space. And I learned a lot. Multiplayer will only work if playing with people not suffering from AP though.
The rules are astonishingly simple, but you have to calculate a lot.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

While the game/math isn't as complex as High Frontier, I still found myself getting tired of trying to math out all the force vs mass ratios and making sure I could do everything I wanted. The aspect of testing your developments was quite interesting but there is a fair bit of luck of the draw there although if you save money you can remove those failure cards for future tests. There is likely a fair bit of replay value in the box due to the variable number of goals/setups in the game. Getting off earth is a pain but it isn't too bad once you are up in space (imagine that! ;-) ). My thoughts are that eventually it will become pretty clear what the best setups are for getting off the ground and moving around space so there is less math and just following set patterns if you play enough. 

I am beginning to think there really won't be a space flight game that will interest me that is based on science and math.

A stunningly beautiful game on exploration of the solar system in the 1950'ies and 60'ies, with graphics that could have been cut out of period magazines and NASA brochures

Makes the math very managable, and adds a very nice reliability mechanism, which I really like - your rocket might just have flown perfectly, but until you have tested it thoroughly, a failure might crop up at any time. - On the other hand, your rocket just might not have any flaws - but you don't know. 

Another nice detail is variable conditions (for example the moon might be the lunar equivalent of quicksand or bare rock, but this is unknown until a recon mission has been flown)

I've not played a full game of this yet. These are just some initial first impressions; It looks amazing and really evokes the period and the subject matter. I want to really like it, but somehow it feels as though it would come to life more with other players and the added tension of trying to grab missions before somebody else, therefore perhaps not testing rockets etc as thoroughly as you would normally and consequently making mistakes, plans falling apart, stuff blowing up... As a solo experience it feels a bit dry. But as I said, I haven't played a full game yet so my opinion might change considerably.

A fun game, with the meat of the decisions being manoeuvres.  I think that these are solvable for each mission and optimum path (although involving some AP).  What is left is a game of risk management, and with 2+ players, a race to the finish, with adaption possible for those using ion drives.

Surprisingly everyone I've introduced this to likes it.  It is basically just a long arithmetic problem, but there is an element of risk management in testing your rockets.

Well, start off by saying I like the game, and what it is trying to do.  The artwork is awesome and the failure mechanism is really excellent, an evolution of the failure mechanisms seen in Liftoff.  The calculations do slow the game though, and to a crawl if one of the players not really into it.  The inevitable comparison is to High Frontier.  I prefer Eklund's game for its breadth, as Leaving Earth is more funneled into specific pathways and ship configurations.  Still, would certainly play and interested in longer scenarios but not sure I need to own it as I know there is no way a casual group would everconsider this.

Very fun, thematic game. But what do you do once you've "solved" a mission? There is no variability other than "this time it takes longer". Maybe that's thematic, but part of the fun was figuring out how to get to Venus, or Mars, and once you figure that out, you can use the same rockets in every game; there's little incentive to try something different.

The theme is right up my alley in that as a child of the 70's, this brings to mind the last few Apollo moon missions, Voyager I and II and Cosmos on PBS!

The game is fun despite the math and it feels SO GOOD when your attempt at a mission goes just as you planned it in your head. I think (IMO) it is ALSO fun when you plan so hard to get that probe to Ceres for a sample return and start it on the way back to Earth when you realize [b]you forgot that the sample has mass![/b]

Wow, this game made my brain work... but I really enjoyed investing in technologies, buying and testing equipment and planning missions. I don't think the maths involved is overly difficult once the concepts are understood. Good planning and risk management are required to be successful. This game is not for everybody but it's excellent for me.

RATING: 5.5
I won, but I think there were rules I was messing up. I forgot that Ion Thrusters are a research/have outcome cards and wasn't tracking years so well. Be more methodical during turns and I'll be fine. Starting with Saturns early felt like a slow slow start as I built inventory and tested rockets. Might be smart to use Juno or Atlas rockets early and make use of those to test critical systems research before breaking out Saturn Rockets and Ion Thrusters.

RATING: 2
I'm sorry to report that I REALLY don't like this game. It looks great, everything having to do with the artwork from the cards to the really cool rules manual is just spot on and after 3 months of waiting for my game to reach me I was really thrilled to play it.

It turns out that there is no game here, just maths. The maths are not just a necessary evil, they ARE the whole game. Once you've calculated the thrust you need, bought your rockets and all, there is quite literally nothing else to it. It's perfectly dry and I really wonder what replayability there is because once you know what you need to get to Mars, you're going to do the same thing every single time you play this game and the Mars mission comes up. As a matter of fact I wonder why the game didn't ship with charts telling you what you need for each mission, that would spare you the all the boring calculations. But I think that in the designer's mind, you're supposed to enjoy those calculations. It's not even interesting maths, just additions and multiplications so I fail to see the point: if you're not into maths you're going to hate the whole process and if you are you're not even going to be challenged by it.

It's when you reach the hard missions with tons of steps that the amount of calculation gets really insane (try for instance going to Mercury, collecting a sample there and then going back to Earth and see how many rockets you need to buy). 

The fact that lots of people seem to enjoy this game is just mind-boggling to me. Usually with games that I dislike I can more or less see how it could appeal to some people. With Leaving Earth on the other hand, I'm struggling to even consider it a game.

As a side note, the rules, while not overly problematic, are far too verbose and full of impressionistic language that's really not rigorous enough for a game of this type. Numbered paragraphs, cross-referencing and an index wouldn't hurt.

RATING: 7
This is only vaguely about getting into space; it is mostly about managing risks and your limited time as you race to outdo your opponent. Space is there, but only as a goal and a setting. It is a shame that it uses a brute-force, math-heavy method to accomplish players reaching the heavens, because if it had used something more elegant it might have been a truly great game.

This game is amazing!  I bought it for the solo play, and that's all I've done so far.  The mechanisms do an amazing job of simulating the perils of space exploration and the balance of risk with the race to complete objectives.  When you land an astronaut on the moon and get them back, it is a TREMENDOUS feeling of accomplishment.  Still no idea how to get a sample return from Ceres.  Seems to take like 20 years.  I usually set the game up (which is stunningly beautiful), and then sit there for about 30 minutes and analyze and start planning major missions.  Then I hit the ground running building and testing technologies.  I LOVE this game, but it does take about 2 hours for me to do a solo game.

I liked a lot of what this game did although I worry with subsequent plays that it will downgrade for me. I feel like there might be an optimal path at the beginning as some rockets were clearly better to research than others. The math wasn't hard nor was there too much of it, but it was more that it was a chore at times.

Edit: After an actual reading of the rules and playing a second game with just me and the missus, I have to say I enjoyed it a lot more. I actually understood what I was doing (actually advancing towards victory) and wanted to play it again immediately after. I'd love to try a solo version, but I think I liked it best with 2 so far. 4-5 might be a bit much unless you do simultaneous turns. I do worry some things might become a more optimal move at the beginning (researching atlas/soyuz for example), but I like the variability of the planets. An excellent game that fills in my space niche until I can actually sit down and play High Frontier.

Writing down this formula, because I've had a hell of a time figuring out the god damn charts math:

Amount of payload it can move = (Thrust / difficultly) - rockets mass

So for example, a Soyuz rocket can move a payload mass of 31 at a difficulty of 2. I.E.  (80 / 2) - 9 = 31 payload mass. Dear fucking god! it all makes sense now. Ion thrusters away! (Apparently on the backside of the player aid is the ion thruster chart. /facepalm)

Update 2: After a 3rd game of it, I'm freaking enamored with it. I love the uncertainty of the planets, the variety of missions and the ways about doing it. I love the thrill of the race to doing something and knowing that you're 1 turn ahead of someone else. It's not a 10, but it's creeping up from a 7 to a 9. It may also rise to a 10 with the expansion.

Includes the Mercury Expansion.

I was utterly fascinated by this at first. The mechanics, the topic. It isn't a simulation (Japan can put a man on Mars by the mid-1970s), but it's a better game for that. The rules are very literal. I suspect there are some loopholes due to the ability to trade everything (it would be very easy for two players to conspire). Mission planning is a blast, but also tends to exhaust itself. E.g., once you've figured out how to put a man on the moon, it isn't quite so interesting any more. A force of good, but not for everyone.

RATING: 8
An excellent simulation of the golden years of space exploration. It is at its core a game about planning space missions. It doesn't feel quite as epic as High Frontier, but it brings a welcoming exploration/alternative reality element which will give that "one more turn" feeling to the game - as you may find microbes in the Moon or that Venus is habitable after all . I love how the objectives - say Man in Mars or Mercury Survey - structure the whole game, giving you a focus for your entire game. Highly recommended!

It's a math game and I love it.  The art and theme are awesome and you feel like you're mission control planning out missions and taking risks due to the tight funding.  I've only played it as a solo game but that's fine with me.  Multi-player might be fun but it's not the most approachable game for people without a similar mind due to all the math.  It's worth noting also that the math isn't complex.  I also really like the extremely small publisher feel to the whole package.

Wow!  For solo play I rate this a 10.  Right now I can't get it out of my head.  For group play, I still want to play, but I despair at getting a group to play it.  It is essentially a race game.  Player interaction is limited to trade and deal making.  What makes it tricky is that it requires long range planning, pretty much with a pencil and paper and a love for arithmetic.  It makes Powergrid  seem like Dixit in comparison.  However, if you are into the planning and so on, the whole effect creates such a strong theme-- you are running missions into space. After all, it is rocket science.

Weirdly I'm rating this eight despite the fact I'm not sure I'll play it again. It looks lovely, it's dripping with theme, it all makes sense. Almost too much sense - the challenge here is mathematical rather than anything else; though there are elements of chance too. If you like the space-race theme, and the logistical struggle more than the exploratory one, but found High Frontier too long, this could be your bag.

RATING: 8.6
As I play this more, it does get a bit repetitive and has lost some of its glamour.
Adding the expansions may help in this regard.

This is a "Calculation" game that requires a lot of thinking, even though the maths is simple.
However the calculation component is very thematic and works exceedingly well with the artwork and other activities to immerse you into the game.
It generates a strong narrative by maintaining an element of luck, both good and bad. :D

I am surprised it is so popular, as it is definitely a niche genre and will not hold everyone's attention. 
I have yet to try the LE:Outer Planets expansion and haven't decided whether to purchase LE:Stations.

An 8 after my first solo game. Upped to a 9 immediately following my second play even after I lost two astronauts on the moon and one more during re-entry.

It scales beautifully between solo, competetive and cooperative mode. I do think the solo game has a "limited" lifespan, even with the expansions,  but I think the competitive game will be endlessly fascinating.

It's funny though, the production value is great and the board depicting the Solar System is gorgeous, yet you spend most of your time staring at charts and equations.

Fascinating game - this a true race for space.

Rules are good (a few clarifications needed), and the artwork is excellent (very evocative of the 1956-1976 time period).

There is a heavy math element when planning your missions (charts are provided to assist yet it's still a brain-burner), but the associated tension and (hopeful) satisfaction in getting the job done is more than worth it. 

Expect to have some mission or component failures along the way, just as in real life (your decisions and funds expenditures can help mitigate risk, but you can't do it all).

The design is very flexible - play solo, co-op, or competitively.

I'm really lovin' this game so far, players are part Budget Administrator, part Mission Control, and part Astronaut. 

Lots of potential for expansions.

Leaving Earth has my mind constantly churning - this design has the right stuff!

It's so full of [-]stars[/-] counting.

There is a lot to like in Leaving Earth, not limited to the well calculated relative mass and lift of the rockets, the glorious artwork and the seemingly pretty clean rule set.

Additional plays may well confirm my concerns about the game length (4 players was too many), the randomness in the scoring (finding ET is 40 points and could occur on Mars?!) and the potentially imbalancing effect of having 3 successes on a Saturn rocket which will cost you (3*$25m + 3* $10m) $105m to completely test vs. 3 minor failures (1* $25m + 3* $5m).

That said, there is a lot to like and a lot to explore here.

RATING: 8
Let's get the worst thing about this out of the way first. This is one non-stop math problem. Usually, it will require not just one solution, but rather multiple solutions as you try and figure out the most efficient way to get your mission critical payloads into space. After that is accomplished, you will more than likely end up recalculating everything when unexpected funding rolls in or a deal is made with another player that offers access to even better technology.

Although this is a "rocket science" game, thankfully all that math is not rocket calculus. The designer has done an incredible job of abstracting that all down to simple mass, thrust and difficulty numbers and the individual calculations are simple addition and multiplication a fourth-grader could do. Still, even with the simplification, the puzzle of how to get a man to the moon and back requires a whole lot of complicated stage planning.

If you can find the fun in all that, you will be endlessly entertained by everything else you find in the game.  Exploration is exactly that. There are multiple cards for each planetary destination, all based on 1950's theoretical observations as well as the real situations on those planets as we know them now. You grab one randomly for each game, so you never know what you will find when you put your first lander on Mars.

The system testing mechanic is ingenious as well. When you research a new technology, you take three result cards with it. These sit face down on the tech card and every time you use that system, you have to draw one of those cards to see if it fails. The catch is that fail or not, you have to shuffle that card back into the pile of three. So you never really know how many fails or successes are on that tech card, unless you pay a research fee to figure out what went wrong and discard that result permanently from your tech card. Of course, no one pays much attention to things that are working, so in another little slice of cleverness, it costs 5 million of your precious R&D budget to discard a failure, but a whopping 10 million to throw out a success. The space agencies receive only 25 million a turn, so voluntarily spending almost half that budget on investigating something that seems to be working fine is an expenditure almost no one wants to make. Of course not doing so means you have no way of knowing if you have three success cards in the deck,  or if you've just seen the same success card three times. That little bit of uncertainty ratchets up the tension, no matter how unlikely a failure seems to be.

Scoring is a matter of claiming objectives that are randomly revealed at the beginning of the game. They can be anything from simple unmanned fly-bys to establishing full martian or lunar colonies. You can attack them in any order, although there is usually a path where one mission will lead to another. Of course, this was called a space race for a reason. No matter what path you decide to take, you have to do it fast because only one player can claim each mission. This, of course, dovetails nicely with the testing mechanic, tempting everyone to push their luck with shaky technology.

Let's be frank. This is probably a better fit for a couple of space geeks, who need a shared sandbox for their astronaut fantasies than as a game for your typical game night. Regardless, I absolutely recommend Leaving Earth to anyone even slightly interested in exploring the solar system. There's nothing like it.

I am going to give this game its lowest rating to date and I HATE to do this because part of it are truly fantastic.
The theme is wonderful and throughly rendered... probably too much. The accuracy by scientific standard, the use of proper words (as much as possible), the feeling of really living that amazing time of our history when we tried to conquer the space... all these are absolutely wonderful aspects of the game. Beside, art and part of the components are quite good too (the cards forming the shape of planets is such a smart touch!). 
And yet... and yet this game, after just one play, seems so long, repetitive and devoided of real fun! It takes sooo long to get things done! Maybe we got part of the rules wrong, but it seems you have to launch so many rockets just to clean your little three cards decks from any failure. And then... you have to take paper and pencil to scribble a lot of calculation! I am a huge math fan, believe me, my very first game was "too mathy"... but this is really too much to be fun, i am sorry. Maybe I'll try this again with some clarification of the rules and the rating will improve.

Kerbal Space Program the board game. Traded away because I'd only ever play it solo (like the computer game). Additionally, the simplification of the rules (it's the Delta-V calculations that make this a heavy game) allowed for unintended consequences like launching a long-term mission and then ground testing all the components before arrival, ensuring success.

The game reminds me a lot of the DVG Leader Series games, and Warfighter, in that a lot of the gameplay is centered around a strategic planning phase. At least in solitaire, and on Hard (and presumably lower difficulties), you start by planning a path through the objectives which will grant you victory. Then you calculate your best odds of achieving it, and set about researching the necessary components. This part is a bit of bookkeeping, but still enjoyable. It's not until the timer is about to run out that you finally launch your one, or two big missions to win the space race.

The game is quite a brain-burner, and was a bit difficult at first to wrap my head around, but it is lovely after grokking it. I am a bit surprised that cautious play is rewarded, as in solitaire play you can simply test everything to guarantee automatic success prior to launching any actual missions. Playing with more players will definitely reward risk taking, given that if you're too slow you'll miss out.

You can run into strange situations, such as completely ignoring exploring the Moon, due to the random nature of the missions in each game. However, this also ups the replay value, and makes it more fun to play.

Unusual math puzzle that is ultimately much more playable than High Frontier and scratches the same itch. A little bit fiddly with all the cards, but app is a wonderful solution for success/failure card flipping. The only real negatives are connected turns in which you do nothing but preparing the mission and potentially terrible downtime - oh, just wait till I calculate my maned mission to Venus (which is of course outright impossible :-D)

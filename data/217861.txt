RATING: 7.3
Fast, easy to understand.
my only concern is like in any draft games, once you have done 3-4 games you understand some of the strategy and because the deck of card is not changing often...you will end up doing the same thing over and over.
Still i think it was good ratio of time spent/amusement.
Would probably do few more games if i am asked

Like 7 Wonders, Paper Tales is a card drafter in which you go to war with the neighbours on either side.  As in 7 Wonders you need to decide to what extent you will rely on warfare or development to bring home the victory points.  Development comes in the form of buildings that generate resources and points.  The novelty here is that your tableau never exceeds four cards.  Ageing and death continually create vacancies in this bijou set.  Despite that four card limitation, it is possible to create some really fun and lucrative combos.  The game zips along and doesn't outstay its welcome.  

Production quality is good and the card art is nicely done in a naive children's book style.

RATING: 7
Quick drafting game that's simpler and faster than 7 Wonders, more complex and gamer-oriented than Sushi Go. Nice cheerful art. Very combo-oriented so a heavy dose of luck is always going to be involved, but I can see this being quite strategic once everyone is familiar with the cards.

I printed the game (French pnp version) and after a few games I can say I really appreciate it.
I just played the two player version (9 cards to draft instead of 5) and there are two really important points to highlight :
- Rules are easy to understand
- Even if you are lost selecting cards during the first game, you can quickly imagine all the combos and you just want to play again !

The game uses a lot of 7 Wonders mechanics (draft selection, buildings that produce ressources or win points) or ideas (wars against your neighbors, combos to grow) but it is clearly different and better in my opinion. 
Main differences are :
- All the cards are part of one pile (there are no Age 1, 2 and 3 decks like in 7 Wonders).
- All your units get old and die after one or two turns so you cannot rely on a long term strategy.
- There is a little part of bluff when you organize your battlefield because you put new cards face down so your opponent does not know what is coming next... 

I also felt that war is the main key to victory. I will edit that after more runs if I find a way to win without focusing on war.

[Edit after more that 10 plays] War is one of the main key to victory, yes. But you can win without beating your neighbors every turn. There are some combos with cards and buildings that can give you the win instead of focusing on war !

I tested the game during the "Bretzels and Games 2017 in Strasbourg (France) with Mr Clement if I do not say nonsense. And I quickly fell under the spell of the game. This one mixes the draft, the card game, the management of kingdom and all with a warrior side !!

The rules are simples to explain, so much so that in the second part (proof that the game is a success for me, considering that at the end of the first part I was ready for a second one !! :) ) I could explain them to new testers :)

On the other hand the game is very rich in possibility and replayability, since a card aging system forces us to turn the cards making up our kingdom. We are being able to "eliminate" ourselves from the cards that we consider obsolete to replace them by some obtained during the draft.

The race in points of victory can take several forms: economic, wars, constructions ... and it can also change face according to the draft :)

To finish the material: the cards have been reviewed since the Japanese version and have graphics that I enjoyed. The visibility of the characteristics of the cards is very good and clear. A system of easily identifiable symbols sparing a lot of superfluous text. This opens the door for many of us;)

So strongly the end of the year !! :)

Rating na 1 keer spelen in Essen.  Slechts 4 rondes, en daarbinnen kan je echt geen strategie opbouwen.  Veel te afhankelijk ook van welke kaarten je kan draften.  Geen van ons 4 vond dit spel fijn.

RATING: 7
This is a cool card drafting / engine building game.  I really think the 2 x 2 (or 3 x 2 grid) of having to deploy your units is interesting, as well as having your units age (and die) throughout the game.  Kind of reminds me a bit of age of assassins and 7 wonders, but is different enough to be its own game.  The 2 player seems like it would be bad, but feels like it would scale well 3 -5 players.  This is one I would like to check out more for sure as a nice game to close out a game day.  The box is way too big for what its the game, and if they had made the board foldable, the box could of been half the size, which is very disappointing.

INITIAL IMPRESSION
Feels like a spin off of Age of Assassins with Drafting cards and placing them down in the front/back row. Combat seems to be the main way to score points and there isn't much engine building in regards to your kingdom because of the short round counter and characters dying. Enjoyable light filler

Fast game (30min). Like 7W but not really. More tense, more decisions. Because your untits will die... it's up to you to adapt your strategy to find the best combo in the right time. Really smart.
Nice artwork too, with parity between men/women characters without usual cliches (same word in french, clichés, just to say it)... in Paper Tales women are blacksmith, strategist, adventurer, rogue or archer... no princess or cooker.

Rien à rajouter aux commentaires existants. Vorpals était (et reste) un jeu exceptionnel dont le seul défaut était de ne plus être disponible. Ses illustrations originales, compliquées à apprécier, ont été remplacées par un habillage remarquable à l'identité visuelle forte. Paper tales mérite de rencontrer le succès que Vorpals n'a injustement pas eu. 

TL, DR, DON'T SPEAK FRENCH : This game is awesome and beautiful. Do yourself a favor : buy it. I mean, buy it NOW.

I have been playing and loving the Japanese version of this game (Vorpals) for a long long time and am really happy to see it is going to have a wider release!

Very polished variant on 7 wonders, with the potential for bigger card combos. 
The game is also quite short, and defies traditional "empire" building strategies, since there might not be enough time to score points if you focus too much on income generation.

Un bon jeu de draft et de combo, avec de la construction de bâtiments.
J'aime beaucoup la mécanisme de vieillissement qui, à l'instar de Twelve Heroes du même auteur, rend le jeu très mouvant le long de la partie.

Pas mal du tout, même à 2 joueurs.
Mais malgré ses qualités ludiques, le jeu souffre de 2 défauts :
 - une boîte bien trop grande pour le peu de matériel à l'intérieur (ce qui gonfle bien évidemment le prix) ;
 - une qualité médiocre des cartes : ce ne sont pas du tout des cartes à jouer comme savent les faire les cartiers (il s'agit juste de papier un peu épais, sans aucune élasticité - les cartes risquent donc de vite s'abimer).

Autre défaut : il est un peu trop calqué sur 7 Wonders, lui même un peu trop calqué sur Fairy Tales.

A fast playing filler game where your tableau of cards has a limited lifespan and you need to develop an engine to get the VPs rolling in. Ignore military strength at your peril as there are a LOT of VPs to be had.

The rules in this drafting game around timing are quite poorly laid out and the card draw seems to introduce rather a lot of luck. Which is a pity because I liked a lot of the basic mechanics and simplicity more than I did with its obvious inspiration 7 Wonders.

Paper Tales is a blend of the popular 7 Wonders and the more obscure Age of Assassins. Like 7 Wonders, players engage in an arms race to boost their combat strength. There's also an element of resource management as well. The Age of Assassins influence is felt in the way drafted cards are arranged into two rows, with cards in front serving a slightly different purpose from the ones at the back. To top it off, Paper Tales adds its own twist in the form of aging, whereby cards gradually die off the tableau.

This is actually quite fun, with the game's own twist of aging making for the most agonising decisions while drafting. The scope for scoring is quite narrow though, and falling behind in warfare is pretty much a guaranteed loss.

Think 7 Wonders style drafting carried out with a very concise and fun village building and battling system. Manage very limited resources over a short 4 turns. This could become a go-to filler.

RATING: 8
The first time I played it, the game felt like a quick playing 7 Wonders clone. However, the second time I played it, I realised that the decisions that you make in this game feel different because of the aging mechanic, and the short playing time means that every single one of them counts. Some cards feel very different than others, making me feel confident that the limited number of cards belies the variability of the game, and that the game will certainly improve with experience. It gets better if you know which cards exist, and are sufficiently comfortable with the game mechanics to really keep an eye on what the other players are planning. Certainly one of the best cardgames to come out this year, with gorgeous artwork as a big bonus.

My gaming experience with Paper Tales is a 3 or a 4. I never got into the game. It's the same as 7 Wonders (that I love) but here, you get something and it goes away immediately. It's frustrating and confusing. i really didnt like it. I am giving a 5 just because maybe it's my fault I didnt understand the game. Others seemed to like it a bit more.
The board graphics is horrible beyond imagination. Illustrations on cards arent bad.

Fantasy card drafting tableau builder.  Simultaneous turn steps keep players engaged. After drafting soldiers, workers, artisans, creatures and relics from passed hands, pay for and place these cards into your expandable 2x2 front and back lines. Next, resolve winning combat with opponents on either side, earn income, build from resources, age cards and repeat. Aging of tableau cards, where most die in later rounds, is a big part of valuing cards and strategy.  I like that many steps are simultaneous, the card paper art is unique.  I also like the thoughtful use of symbols on cards for rules reminders.

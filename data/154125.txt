Better than the other Pocket Battle I played because the War to Prevent Southern Independence is a conflict to which I can relate. 

Setup is half the game, and combat is a bloody affair. I recommend random selection of units: 60 or 70 points per side; you can chuck and replace two or three you don't want. Watch out for the artillery pieces that can fire from the second rank. Add an officer to yours and blast away!

For such a small game, there's actually a lot to think about. How should you group your units? Should you shoot or charge (close combat)? Do you put a wound chit (and lose an action) on a two-wound unit or simply lose a one-wound unit in your group? Put cavalry on your first rank or keep it in reserve to surprise the enemy's vulnerable rear later on?

Unfortunately, the game's a bit "wristy," and luck plays a major role (the game's only downside).

These are fantastic games--I really wish they would make more armies.

Extremely well produced.

Good game to take on vacation.  Small, easy to play, and the action is fierce.

I liked this, but I tend to get less play from games that require my opponent to build an arm, decks or soforth.

Same rules apply to these units as in previous pocket battle editions. Artillery is more lethal than other type of units and adding an officer to it can improve your chances for a hit. There are a lot of decisions to be taken so much for choosing the right troops and forming units as well as issuing an order at the proper time during the conflict. Luck is also a fact when trying to score a hit but can be balanced by a well thought planning of tactics. It is a nice designed mini wargame. It plays fast and one can derive fun out of it.

American Civil War version of the Ancients system. Actually plays out just as well and still has a sense of fighting a C19th battle. Like the artwork on the whole and it is just as fun as the Ancients version.

Press your luck on a foreseen probability of the result from  unit battles and choose between the action of melee fight or long shooting ,those are exciting experience that I have got from this fast pace board war game. Addictive to the tactical part of playing , also Highly recommend because the replay value from diff sets with diff. army building .
I also enjoy with the army building time for setup very much as this is already an imaginary part before the battle begins.

A great war game, that fits in your pocket! It uses tiles as troops, and the position of the tiles, and use of the special powers is key to victory.

I love this series. These are not serious war games to be used for the better understanding of historic (or fantastical) tactics. They are light games, with TONS of replay ability since you can change the game size and how you build your army each game. I found that for each set I add to my collection my enjoyment of the overall series moves up exponentially. Also...... it fits in your pocket.

I knocked off a point due to the unfortunate misspellings on some of the units. "Whithworth"??

The fact that nearly all the units have ranged attacks hurts the game a bit. The system works better for pre-gunpowder (as is the case with the other games in the series).

This is a fun very light war game to fill about 1/2 hour.  The game is more fun if you play a 100 point battle.

a really solid war game that is fast to play but has real depth in both preparation and play.  Maybe a tad random with certain factions/builds but still very skill focused.

With two similar forces, both with a lot of shooting dice, it looks like this would become a random dice fest.  However, the units are well matched with special powers that give you ways to work around the deadly range attacks, making the game still quite tactical and interesting.

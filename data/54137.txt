I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Even if I'm not at all a fan of abstract games, I enjoyed this one. The beautiful components, the artwork and the crazy theme for sure help a lot, but also the game-play is pretty good. It's challenging and interesting enough to make it stand out and it also plays really really quickly.

Battle Sheep for sure is nothing I'll go out of my way to play, but it's an entertaining game and works perfectly as a filler. Good enough!

Really simlar to Hey That's My Fish and Sugar Gliders, but has one key advantage over them, the setup is waaay faster and even though the footprint is little bit bigger it is not an inconvenience. Components of the highest quality.

I would play this one again. Cute sheep that try to trap each other by blocking them and getting caught themselves by other players. I do suggest playing with three players. I would only play this one though if someone else suggested it. Not my first, second, or even my seventh pick. But still cute.

Surprisingly very fun. I usually have steered clear of Blue Orange Games just because they haven't put out anything that I've really liked for a while, so I wasn't expecting much when I picked up this game. I found it surprisingly fun and simple to learn, yet offers enough tension for strategy. One of the games on my to buy list since I have played it a lot and am always willing to play it if someone offers,

Sort of a simplified set up "Hey That's My Fish" (HTMF) kind of game, which makes this a pretty good game that plays nice and quick.  On the other hand, the "stack allocation" mechanic just doesn't quite feel as fun as HTMF.  Still, this is definitely a good, essentially abstract, filler.

RATING: 7.9
Interesting abstract game of position and blocking for control of most spaces on the pasture. You move stacks of sheep around in straight paths along the hexagonal grid, splitting up an initial 16-tile stack. The sheep tokens are excellent quality, and it's a pretty thinky head to head game, though I do enjoy another, similar Blue Orange title called Crab Stack slightly more than this.

I like how the game is tight enough that it jumps into the meat right away. From the beginning of the game you can already feel that the end is nigh. And as the game continues it gets tighter and tighter until someone loses.

However, I would like the game more if it came with suggested board configurations as opposed to having the set up be part of play. 

For one, because we don't know what board configurations make for a good game (we had one game with a narrow choke point and the winner was decided upon initial sheep placement, not very fun). 

And for two, the decisions are way too opaque to be able to draw a connection between where I placed that second tile and whether or not that helps me or hurts in my efforts to win. And if I can't draw that connection, then how do I make decisions during this phase if my decisions are meant to be made in the context of trying to win the game?

**Comments based on the 2 player game only**

Our first few games of this were [i]really[/i] rough - it's pretty easy to setup the board and place your initial stack in such a way that you just screw yourself from the get go. Seriously we called like 3 games after [i]two turns[/i] because someone had already been boxed into a corner. You can avoid this with smarter placement, but it means that anyone new to the game might be in for some pain at first - in other words this game can completely suck in the first impressions department.

Once you learn to avoid those trappings you're in for a quick abstract with some pleasant decisions. The trouble for me though is that it's all too easy for [i]one[/i] bad move to screw you, thus ending the game anticlimactically prematurely. I'm all for games where every move counts, but not ones where I feel like all I'm ever doing is trying to avoid dumb mistakes for fear of driving the game to an early, boring end.

This game gets compared to Hey, That's My Fish! a lot and they do feel fairly similar. Though HTMF avoids all of these problems... plus it's cheaper and more portable. The only downside is the setup but honestly I'd take that over this any day.

Also - you might look at this game as compared to HTMF and think - hey! you can have different board configurations for different strategies - more variety! That's what I thought at first too, but honestly the board setups in this game largely just fall into "good setups" and "bad setups" - where it's too easy to cut someone off at the start. HTMF is a consistently good experience, whereas this game gives you some pitfalls you have to avoid.

Looking forward to trying this with more people, though I suspect it will be too easy for at least one person to get knocked out super early.

I think the retheme to 'Battle Sheep' does the game more harm than good... but hey, I'm not the publisher so what do I know. If funky sheep sell a game, go for it.

I rather like the idea of moving about stacks of discs, splitting them up as you see fit, in order to box in an opponent. It resembles in some way the breadcrumb mechanism found in many games bu Rüdiger Dorn, but is at the same time rather different. If you keep on moving with a big stack, you limit your options and set yourself up for capture. If you split up too much, you're not allowing yourself sufficient breathing space to kill off the opponent. Nice little touches through and through. I'm just not sure whether the game is worth it to be played with more than 2 players, though: there are no balancing mechanisms in place, meaning that if two gang up on a third, that unlucky sod is completely out of the game in no time flat. Thus the only 'social' way of playing the game is if everybody hits on each other in turn order, but that prevents trap tactics from flourishing. I'm going to look for future comments, see if the game is worth its purchase price.

"Bah-ram-you, you jerkface! You just blocked my sheep off!"

I think this is an excellent abstract game. It's quick and simple, but strategic and requires a little bit of forethought and prioritized planning. The components are extremely high-quality. The player tokens are thick, solid discs each with a sheep of the player's colour with a different and amusing art. Recommend!

Battle Sheep is the game "Hey, That's My Fish!" wanted to be, as the game is more focused on closing in your opponents rather than quartering off territory. This is admittedly a subtle difference, but turns the game into a more confrontational and interactive affair, which better suits the mechanics. As with most full-information games, it can play a tad slow as players are encouraged to predict their opponent's moves, and plan for the future, but its hard to parse all of the possible options so surprising moves are aplenty. Its limited scope will only warrant so many plays, but those plays will be both quick and enjoyable.

Reasonable abstract for 2 players.  A game marketed successfully on the coattails of Hey, That's My Fish (a great game).  However, Battle Sheep's cartoony theme and nice bits can't overcome 2 major problems-- playing with more than 2 players causes a serious 'gang up' problem, and the variable game board all too often creates starting positions with too unevenly powered starting positions.

Battle Sheep is an abstract game somewhat reminiscent of "Hey, that's my fish" or "Fjords." Compared to the former, it gets rid of the fiddly setup which is a big plus, but with more than two players there is still roughly the same potential for king-making and/or ganging up on someone else. Therefore, it is probably most compelling in its original incarnation for two players only.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm certain people hate playing this with me, because I know the strategy to always win. Don't bother with it if you're only going to have 2 players, and during setup try to avoid creating a field with segments that are only 1 hexagon wide, as those are far too easy to guard.

Battle Sheep is a pretty nice game!  People have said it's sort of like Hey, That's My Fish! but I find it quite different. The blocking is there, but it feels a little more brutal in this game. You can really get cut off if you are not careful!  It might be a little hard for the kids to see a few turns ahead in order to plan successfully, but they may still like it anyway. It's a cute game, easy to set up and has some genuine strategy behind it. Options can feel limited at times (usually it's rather easy to see what your best move is) but no biggie considering this game is good for all ages. It is a little bit too deterministic for my tastes to keep around.

The version I played at Essen 2014 had very good and chunky components. Felt almost a bit over-the-top, but the price point seems still okay.

I'm not too much into abstracts. But if you are, this is definitely worth a try. Good one!

This is a great game, especially since it works for almost all ages.  It's a very simple game to learn but definitely requires tactical planning to win this short game.  You might think that because my youngest daughter used to beat a table of adults that this might be a kids game, but the power of underestimation was strong in her...  Plus, sometimes adults just plain and simple, overthink things.  We break this game out alot when in groups of adults only, as well as mixed ages.  The games are short, often as quick as 5 minutes, but can run 20.  The bits are really nice, being made of heavy ceramic(?) tiles, decorated with different sheep faces.  Teh game board hex tiles are heavy and kinda plain since they are grass, but still nice.  I was really surprised at the quality for a relatively low-cost game.

Quick filler game.  After 3 successive plays, will definitely need to incorporate the original Splits rule for additional ties is that the last player able to move wins.  Love that it is quick to set up, quick to explain, and quick to play.  Also really like that the sheep aren't cardboard discs, but rather a solid heavy plastic (hefty like a decent quality poker chip).

This is a great game for a wide age group -- enough strategy to entertain adults but simple for young kids to play. My 7 year old beat me (legitimately) on our first play through, but while my 4 year old understood the movement she didn't quite understand the stack splitting strategy.

The tile placement board ensures that no two plays will ever be the same. It also makes playing with fewer than the maximum players elegant, as you just use fewer tiles for the board.

I am extremely impressed by the quality of the tokens. I was expecting punch-out cardboard sheep, but instead got nice, heavy-duty plastic sheep tokens that feel a lot like casino-quality poker chips.

RATING: 7.1
Can't have too much love for Battle Sheep!  In this game you take turns spreading your flock around the pasture.  The one who occupies the most hexes at the end wins.  A key feature to this game is the variable board.  Each player takes turns playing their four pasture tiles (each with four hexes) at the beginning of the game.  This makes for some interesting pastures!  Works well with 2, 3, or 4.

I love the pieces in this first and foremost. The plastic chips for the sheep are just fantastic along with the board tiles. The game plays in an extremely short amount of time so it's definitely a filler game. Deceptive level of strategy but definitely an extremely light game. Played it with my kids and a person who has a hard time learning board games so it went well with all but my teenager who is a little old for the theme. Great for kids or just a quick game.

Nice territorial game.  Reminds me a little of Amazons.  My main concern at the moment is that the whole thing is a little to constrained, and games are over too soon.  I may have to buy a second set to address the issue :)

This is a great little abstract game. It replaces hey that's my fish! since it sets up so much faster and has a similar feel. The limited movement (go as far as you can in one direction) also makes it play faster. The component quality is top notch. The sheep discs have a very nice weight to them. I brought it as a lunch game to work and we played 4 games in a row. Being able to vary the board set up is a nice touch too.

A deceptively simple game with interesting decisions and a fun, whimsical theme. It's essentially an abstract game with great art and components to make it a bit more enticing.

I like that you build the board together out of hex tiles before you get started, which both makes each game unique and gives you interesting strategic decisions and a sense of ownership of the game before it even starts. The rules are easy to teach and pick up, and allow for tough decisions. There's a good amount of interaction and you can screw opponents over with big plays, but it doesn't feel terribly mean because of the cute theme and short playtime.

Note: It's not great with two players, because without the chaos of extra players it takes on a chess like feel where you can and should map out your moves far in advance to win.

A cross between TZAAR and Hey, That's My Fish. Move stacks of sheep on a board in an attempt to claim territory and cut your opponent(s) off from doing the same. When no moves are left, count the hexes each player controls and the higher number wins. Dead simple. 

What I like about this one is that it has a "cold open," sort of like when you as a viewer are expecting to see the opening credits and theme song of a show, but instead you get dropped into a chase scene with no warning and the action starts immediately. Same thing here. The game is short, and that's because, like TZAAR, the early ramp-up has been dispensed with, You get an immediate sense that you're in trouble and you've only moved one piece. That's awesome. 

My only complaint is a minor component gripe, but these pieces are supposed to be stacked and stackable, and they don't nest together well since they are smooth discs.

Quite clever game which feels a little like Hey That's My Fish, Amazons, Fjords, and the like, where you're essentially trying to cut off more territory than the opponent... but it's got a really interesting twist that you also have to commit a certain number of disks to different spaces, with each move, so you could end up with a big space all your own but not enough disks to fill it up, thus costing yourself.

The rules are dead-simple, and the strategy is cool and non-obvious. It plays quickly. Well worth trying out.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 2er

This is a pretty dry abstract game, with really cute art and awesome production! The sheep tiles are like those bakelite things -- heavy, feel good to play with; the tiles are nice and thick; and even the insert is nice, fitting everything snugly. 

The game itself is simple: to set up, take turns constructing a play area by placing 4 tiles (each with 4 hexes), one at a time, on the table. Then each player places their stack of 16 sheep on an edge hex. On your turn, take up to n-1 tiles off the top of any of your stacks, and move in a straight line until you hit something (another stack, or board edge). The game ends when no player can move any more; the player controlling more hexes (tiebreaker = largest contiguous area) wins!

It's sort of like Hey! That's My Fish! in that you want to cordon off large areas for yourself, ideally locking other players off into tiny little areas of the board. Except here:
- every tile is the same value 
- the form of the play area varies every game (which you can do in Hey! as well, of course, as a variant)
- you must move as far as possible

As an abstract, it's unlikely to rate highly for me. But fans of the genre may like it more, and it does get a +0.5 for production!

I like the name and the sheep, it plays super fast and is sure deeper than it looks. The placing at the start of the game and the first 2 moves are so important, sadly then the game can take over and play it for you since those choices are often consequences from the start position, but since it plays so quickly that is okay.

Components: :star::star::star::star::nostar: While the tokens are sturdy they could be made of something nicer, perhaps a bit more like traditional poker chips. The modular boards are thick enough to last a while. The box is too big and could be half the size.

Art: :star::star::star::star::nostar: Its a simple game, with simple but well done art. If I was being picky I would ask for a little more detail on the pasture tiles but the art serves the game well.

Rules: :star::star::star::star::star: Rules are simple and well written. Scoring is obvious and simple. 

Gameplay: :star::star::star::star::nostar: Gameplay is quick and simple, easy enough for young children to pick up but with enough strategy to keep adults engaged. 

Player Interaction: :star::star::halfstar::nostar::nostar: It can get a little bit "take-that" like at times with blocking off the other players, but can also very easily be played in complete silence.

General Comment: An enjoyable filler game when the need to compete against someone sets in. Great introduction to strategy for young gamers.

Would I buy again if lost/damaged beyond playability: 
:thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup: Absolutely! It gets frequent table time in our home and in the classroom and would be replaced fairly quickly.

Each player starts with a single stack of tokens. A move is to take any number of tokens off the top (i.e., split a stack) and move them as far as possible in any direction. The winner is the last able to move.

It's a clever, simple, mean abstract. In play it feels essentially similar to Hey, That's My Fish (walling off areas for exclusive use etc.), but slower.

The Battle Sheep edition has frustratingly unusable components: green discs with different coloured pictures, rather than different coloured discs, makes stacks hard to distinguish.

A very simple area control game, Battle Sheep can be taught in 5 minutes and played in 20, and is an excellent gateway game. The components are top-notch - thick boards, very solid chips, everything is very high quality and just looks and feels good in-hand. The gameplay is like a stripped down version of Go - you are trying to cover the board with more of your sheep than your opponent's, and strategy emerges out of trying to pin down opposing sheep or cordoning off unclaimed areas. It's not complicated at all but it is surprisingly engaging and interactive. Battle Sheep is no joke - don't play this game with care bears as it can get downright cutthroat.

RATING: 6
I can see the comparisons to Hey! That's My Fish! but this one feels different.  The fact that you HAVE to move all the way creates a lot of different options.  It's not as easy to block since you can't always choose where you want to stop.

That said, if you own one, you don't need the other.

RATING: 6.5
This is an abstract strategy game where players are moving their stacks of sheep around the board trying to claim the most pastures.  It can be a bit cutthroat and leaving yourself plenty of options can be a good thing.  The game seems to play equally well with 2, 3, or 4 players.

tl;dr: [thing=8203][/thing] but different

Why do people keep on designing variants of games that do well, but without adding anything new to the genre? It's like deck building. You can just take Dominion, name the cards and the actions a bit differently and switch a couple things up and boom, new game. Or you can take that mechanism and use it to make something new. Boom, A Few Acres of Snow.
OK, so there's no way of taking [thing=8203][/thing] and turning it into A Few Acres of Snow, but taking a game, making it slightly different without making it feel much different doesn't add anything at all. So why would I spend my money on a game that does the same as an other game? That's right, I wouldn't. So I won't spend money on this game either. There's nothing wrong with it though, it works.

Fun little game - great components.  We enjoy pulling this out when you have 5 minutes to fill.  This will probably be a game introduced to the kids around 5 (says ages 7 and up).

Cute, approachable, cuddly. The box cover says it all. The game play however, is anything but.

Battle sheep's closest relative is Hey That's My Fish. Game play is almost similar with the difference being the absence of different value fish tiles and penguins. Starting with a stack of 16 sheep, players move around a randomly put-together field to try and grab as many pastures as possible. A maximum score of 16 should win or tie the game, but in a cut throat race to grab pastures, not every sheep in your flock will have their own playground. 

So, race around and collude, back stab. Cut off other players flock, all in the name of fun and games. At least each game should last no more than 10 minutes. Whew....

Just played this twice and then bought it, a four-player game, and it was a really clever, simple filler game, and probably would be wonderful to play with young kids, 4 or 5 and up, though it was also fun with just adult experienced gamers, being an abstract game you can put some serious tactical thought into it (which makes it great for teaching young kids how to calculate ahead and develop cognitive skills). It's simple, short, easy to set up and put away, only takes maybe at the most 10 minutes to play, and it's really fun. Check out the review at http://youtu.be/fTPmQQMj87E

Represents many of the things I hate in games. Area control/majority and kingmaking. Left me mildly pissed after the game as some games with these features have some "fun" features to balance up the harsh nature of the rest of the game, this game has only the harsh parts. However, it is very fast to play and teach which is what saves it on some level.

Very fast and simple game, but there is a strategy to it. Players take turns creating the board and then placing there sheep out on the board. The goal of the game is to expand your flock as far as you can, and trying to split up  and isolate the other players sheep. 1-11-16

RATING: 8
A fun and simple game, but once you start playing the strategy comes in to play. Your trying to decide how many sheep to move and try and block your opponents. But then they move their sheep in a place you did not expect. Fast game but makes you think. Really funny art work of sheep on the chips. Give it a try.

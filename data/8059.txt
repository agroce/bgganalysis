Competent, but pretty boring.  "Rich get richer" was not a problem in our 5-player games, but I can see how it could be under certain circumstances if players do not stay on top of the leader.  All in all a mediocre effort.

RATING: 9
In my opinion is a very nice game, easy to learn and deep to play. 
At the end of a 4-players game the winner was at 12 points, the other players at 9-8-8, so I think is a balanced game too.

RATING: 4
Another Andrew Parks game. I should know better. It's a 'fine' game that has no real powerful draw. The generic nature of the ideologies means they really aren't that terribly different, and the abstract "conquer this card" nature of it is similar to Camelot Legends, another game I really wanted to like but couldn't.

RATING: 4
Rating based on a single play. I suppose if you like diplomacy and role playing your position it would be more fun. Felt the opening was random (with rich get richer) and the endgame people have to sacrifice too much to take on the leader ... if you hit the leader the next place player wins. I could easily be wrong, but since I didn't enjoy the experience much I doubt I'll give it another chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I was very intrigued by the theme of the game, and when I finally played it I had contrasting feelings. The theme fits the game quite well, with the majority mechanism used in a clever way. Nevertheless, there's some awkward design choices that prevent the game to be great: the randomness of the region drawn, the (too) many phases in which cards can be played and, most important of all, the way cards are drawn (if you're last you draw less cards, so you will not catch up)... there's a lot a things that could have been better...

I really enjoyed my first play of Ideology, and I don't normally enjoy games with too much diplomacy or the ability to gang up on the leader. It seems to have the right combination of diplomacy and conflict for my tastes, and it also feels thematic.  Looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 7
An intriguing game about world politics and major powers.  Certainly more interesting than typical "global conquest" games, since there's not just a military component, but also economic and cultural components, involved in wrestling for control of a country.  The special text is not so much on the cards themselves but inherent in the upgrades and in the major powers themselves; Commuism will have different advantages and disadvantages from Captilism, Fundamentalism, etc.  There's a little bit of diplomacy involved, since you can be either at war, peace, or neutral to other powers, which affects what you can do to them---and what they can do to you.

Components are not of good quality and the game is too abstract, dry and in the end not so fun. Another problem is the kingmaker factor. If somebody takes an advantage, all the others will gang on him. Anyway there are some bright ideas. Not my cup of tea.

This rating is primarly based on component quality, that's very very low (paper map, thin cardboard markers with printing on only one side). About the game itself: when I'll be able to improve the markers (glue them on rigid cardboard, cut them etc...) perhaps I'll  return on this rating.

Interesting twist on the area-influence style of game but is a bit dry in execution and has a few elements that do not appeal to me.    There is a "strong get stronger" aspect to the game that forces players to collude to take down the leader or lose the game.  The random draw of what territories come up can be dissatisfying if too many are adjacent to one player but not the others.  The decisions around how to use your limited resources are excellent, though!

Kind of a surprise, I didn't expect like this game as much. It has some clever card play and some area control. There are lots of options on how to play your cards by being more aggressive. There may be some players who are not as keen on conflicts, and some may have an advantage if other opposing players are dueling. I won without causing any conflicts and staying neutral, while others interacted and attacked each other losing more of there cards. I wouldn't mind playing this again and I am curios how other games might go.

This game is relatively simple but has some strategy and depth to it, especially later on in the game.  I wouldn't mind playing this multiple times with a variety of ideologies, as that really changes how one should play (due to the special powers of different ideologies).  It reminds me somewhat of the Illuminati card game in some respects.  It's definitely not a game to play with people who take political doctrine too seriously or have a poor sense of humor.

If it were released 20 years ago, it would have been revolutionary.  Today it just seems really bloated, boring, and tedious.  Clearly borrows majority mechanics from the German games but also has elements of American-style conquest games.  I found that the resources were too limited to really make solid, defensible decisions and I also thought that there were some silly rules that didn't make sense (discarding advances to gain a different advance, then havin g to re-buy the old one?).  That being said, it's fairly interesting (if not exactly fun) and it is good to see this type of game simplified and brought down to a managable playing time.  AWFUL components- paper map with tiny spaces, ugly clip-art style art...don't you guys hire graphic designers?

Despite the asymmetric players this is more a game than a simulation of the "War of ideas". Don't look for any historical content in spite of the picture on the box. The game is card driven. You need combinations of cards to acquire other cards which allow you to perform certain actions, or the combination of which allows you to acquire yet other cards, which...exactly.

Theme seems intereting at first view with cool ideas. Each player represents a country. Not very interesting to look at. You play cards to capture properties. There are special powers in Ideology. There is some randomness in the game. Also, it takes a lot of space on the table. Rules need some improvement. Not balance.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

I don't plan to play Ideology: The War of Ideas any time soon.

Traded Ideology in a three way deal.

RATING: 7
The rules of this quasi-wargame are elegant and simple, and there are some nice "Euro"-mechanics at work here. The only negative factor is the fact that players definitely have to gang up on leaders (the rulebook even recommends it), which is never a good trait, because then kingmaking reigns supreme. But a lot of thought has gone into representing the different factions, and there is a definite "feel" for the theme.

Even with the suggested starting ideologies, a 2 player game is still not very well balanced, and in fact, I really don't like it with only 2.  3 or more though, and this set collecting game with plenty of back stabbing goodness is strategic and very fun to play.  I would probably rate this higher if the 2 player version wasn't so ... meh.

Played 1 time. This game had a lot of promise for me because I'd heard good reviews on it from the Westbank gamers. Now I only wonder what on earth were they thinking? Of course the production is ridiculously bad, but it's the game that bothered me. It is a twist on an influence game where players play cards beside properties in order to capture them. There are special abilities in the game, but most of them are painfully symmetrical. In fact, that phrase summed up the whole game for me: painfully symmetrical, all the text and powers from the carsd were perfectly worded amongst each otehr meaning there was no real strategic tension for me. In that respect, it reminds me of Industrial Waste. Why have lots of different qualities or resources if they all do the same thing?

Totally luck based game, with little room for player decisions once everyone gets the basics, i.e. after one or two games.

I'm strongly attracted to the theme, and the core gameplay mechanisms relate well to that theme.  But unless my game group is missing a rule, there also seems to be a serious runaway leader problem.

Another "throwback" - had this game been released 15 years ago, I'd have owned a copy and played the snot out of it. (It would have been a star in the old AH firmament.) As it is, I enjoyed the game I played (as the Communists, our five year plans helped us triumph over the Facists & the Islamic Fundamentalists) but I don't have any real desire to play it again.

However, if you're a fan of this style of game, I can not recommend it highly enough. The rules are crystal-clear, the game runs smoothly and actually heads toward a conclusion, and the graphics are (for the most part) easy to follow. (Which is important in a game that spread itself COMPLETELY across a six-foot table in less than 2 hours.)

Game suffers from the "snowball" effect.   Once a player has gained momentum, stoping him/her alone is not possible.

Once someone has gained control of a neutral, it's way too easy for them to develop it.

Bash-The-Leader appears to be the best method to use to slow him/her down.  If you're in the lead, screwing up your move is the best thing you can do, in order to drop a spot or two...

Best strategy is to let other players take care of the leader while you attempt to go for the win by sailing in from 2nd or 3rd place.

Each power has a special ability and a disability.  Some of them make little sense, like Capitalism not being allowed to declare war.

Each player's deck is limited to 45 cards, which is an attempt to reduce the snowball effect, IMHO.  Once you are at 10 points, you need to discard most if not all of your influence in other countries in order to concentrate on the 2-3 you control.

The rulebook is built around the turn order, which means you need to read the rules twice, as the first pass will provide you with info which should have been explained before the Turn Order Sequence.

The game is too pricey for the quality of the components, which are almost as thin as paper.  As the 1 thru 6 counters were too difficult to pick up, we swapped them out for dice...

Essentially, this is a card game which could have done without the counters and paper map.

The Peace/Neutral/War diagram is cool, but would have been easier to read as an X-Y table (someone has uploaded one here!)

On the positive side, the turn order is well thought out.

Very much a game that's dominated by mechanism. Rigid turn structure and paper chits recall the Avalon Hill games of the 80's, implemented in some of the flimsiest components I've seen since SPI's wargames of the 70's. Thought has clearly gone into the turn structure creating a nice dilemma over how best to 'spend' your cards, but it's far too easy to develop countries you already control rather than having to battle to acquire extra ones, making the game a rather passive experience.

I have played only with the first edition rules, furthermore I was the Islam, the weakest of the ideologies (they changed this on the second edition rules). The game can be a tad long, but I really like the theme and the mechanics. It has little luck (which is a must for me in a long game) as there are only 3 kind of cards, Overall I enjoy the game and I want to play it again soon.

It’s been years since I last played Ideology: The War of Ideas. The truth is I no longer want to pay it again so I will rate the game accordingly. I have changed a lot during these years. The game is too light for my current tastes

Decent game.  I can see that there could be a catch the leader problem, however this game is short enough (almost filler like) that it doesn't bother me so much - and if you make good plays there won't be a run away leader.

Better than the other "big" Parks game Parthenon but still not really good. It's a multiplayer conflict card game with the usual hosage and kingmaking potential. But at least its complexity and duration fit a game with these characteristics (not like Struggle of Empires for instance). The game gets a minus point because it's not as thematic as it wishes to be. The advances are symmetric and don't open opportunities for strongly differing strategies.

i played it once. the quality of the components is very poor, making me wonder why they didn't just shove the whole thing in a ziploc bag and sell it like a cheapass game. that being said, i quite enjoyed this game and look forward to getting in a second game in the near future

2nd ed. "Messy" might be the best word to describe "Ideology." Well, maybe "tedious" would be better still, but let's stick with "messy." The game is divided into too many too-similar phases (eight), and while none takes particularly long to execute, the overlap among them and the varying rules for how each is to be performed (simultaneously; in turn order and all at once for each player; in turn order and in one-action rounds till all players pass in succession) create some confusion. It's probably unfair after what's likely my one and only one play to say there's a runaway leader problem, but getting a jump in Global Influence means getting more cards, which means having more options (especially on defense), which probably means more Global Influence. I'd have to say that the rulebook is actually pretty well done; it's the basic game flow that doesn't work well for me.

RATING: 6
This is a decent, rather abstract, card game about building an empire through playing influence cards to acquire, attack or develop territories throughout the globe.  Despite the abstract mechanics, the game gains a bit in theme by having the different ideologies each begin with different advantages and disadvantages.  On fatal flaw for me with this game is the potential for players to "bash the leader" and use all their resources to bring down an opponent.  Although I haven't seen this happen in my limited play, it has the potential to make a fairly long game (for what it is) even longer. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Interesting game and topic.  How is it different from Avalon Hill's "Kremlin"? No swastika for the Fascism...I noted there is a politically correct issue here. Islamic Fundamentalism?  Why not just Islamic?  On the other hand, not all Communists are bad guys which deserves killing. Looking for the 2nd edition for much improved graphics.

A game value for money.  It can be played by 5 people, each representing a major influencing power in the modern world.  Each has its own unique ability and weakness.  A lot of talking and fun in this game.  As a leader of the power, how do you direct the course of its development to the ultimate goal of controlling the world?  

The game ends when a power gather 12 Global Influence points, while all powers begin at 3 in their home nation.  Germany has the military might but plauged at spreading her Fascism idea all over the world due to intolerance of other ideas.  Soviet Russia has the iron curtain effect over its subjects to have economic ties with the rest of the world, thus slow to control any region at the economic front.  Its totalitarian regime  grips tight over the controlled region with matching influence if there is other trying to attack its nation subjects.  Islam in Iran can spread his religious revolutionary ideas rather quick with military threat (if not countered for) but slack in industrial advancemt.  Great Britain the Imperialist can spread her influences easily on all fronts far reaching with global colonization as long as the region is a low level one but they slack at industry advancement due to limited economic manpower.  United States is the last batison of the free world due to isolationism - she never declare war on anyone unless attacked.  She is good at defending culutral influence in the attractive name of freedom.

An exciting and well-designed strategy game. It's intensely competitive  - a small error early on can lead to subtle disadvantages later that it's very hard to recoup from. It's pretty abstract, but played with a bit of imagination it can start to feel like a genuine struggle for world domination. My main complaint is that there's very little in the game to distinguish the five "ideologies" - just geographical position and a few rules exceptions that really don't come into play all that much.

Quite nice novel mechanics to represent a cold war . . or perhaps not so novel:  once you play Milton Bradley's [I]Summit[/I] (1961), the mechanics don't seem so novel.  

This game is a definite improvement over [I]Summit[/I]:  there are more countries, [I]Summit[/I] didn't portray ideologies at all, and the components are nicer.

Area control card game with variable player powers. The theme is fun and the different ideologies are hilariously truthful.

A lot of take that and beat the leader going on. The rich get richer, but suddenly everyone is bashing the leader with everything they got and a new leader emerges. Our first game was a bit too much of back and forth attack. Almost everyone had a chance to win in the last 5 rounds, but people kept nuking them (somehow we missed the nuke's adjancy rule).

As a playtester of this game, I was initially struck by it's strategy elements, and how they must be shifted due to the distance penalty. But my appreciation for that has been dwarfed by the thematic brilliance of the game. It seems that the game often becomes a real-world model, and I believe that that has mostly to do with the choices Andy made for each ideology's strengths and weaknesses. Play this game.

I wish I had written this earlier when fresher in my mind, but we didn't enjoy this at all.  We found the rules dense and difficult to interpet and the various ideologies seemed pasted on.  Great concept, love the idea.. but no one in the 5 player game enjoyed it.  The only game for us that bombed.

The one positive I will say that as the first game we struggled greatly to find the fun in, as well as understand the rules it was also a uniting game in a way not even any of the co-ops have been.  As a group we felt united in our attempt to make it through.  Thank you Ideology!

A somewhat unique theme, with some truly unique mechanics make this game an innovative design at present. While a nuisance to explain, the game is in fact quite simple once you get the hang of it, and there are numerous possibilities to explore different strategies. One should definately keep a long-term plan in mind.
My only real gripe is the endgame, and it's also the reason I don't play it as much as I used to. Because of the end-of-game trigger (a certain amount of VP) people will cooperate to stop the leader from winning, whereafter another player goes away with it, only to be stopped subsequently. This can go on and on, dragging the game to an unsatisfying end where one card decides the game - pretty much negating all the previous plans and plays that were the actual "game".
I sincerely hope the upcoming 2nd edition will fix this, because I personally haven't found a variant which truly adresses this problem.

Not quite certain what I think of this game...the one I played, I was thrashed so maybe that colored my view.  Nobody close to getting many of the 'advancement' cards, and I don't see how it would happen unless it is a very pacifist group (which we don't have).  Interesting game, though.

RATING: 1
Pros: Everybody enjoyed the theme quite a bit and thought that what the game was trying to accomplish was intruiguing and new in concept.
Cons: This game bites. The rules as written make the strong grow stronger and make it very difficult for laggards to catch up. You know it's bad when the strategy tips  in the rulebook encourage the players to gang-up against whoever is in the lead to prevent him from running away with victory!! 
As it stands I would have given the game a '3', but the totally horrendous components make it underserving of anything but the lowest score possible.

We usually play this game twice in an evening - the first game takes 10 minutes, and the second game is 2-3 hours long.

It is so easy to win this game - so you need to stop people ahead of time.  Taken to its logical conclusion, this means that you need to keep all players at essentially zero Victory Points at all time.  When all 5 players understand and play in this fashion, the game is a fantastic battle of wills.

It's basically an overly complicated card game with an layered auction mechanism.

A thematically interesting game with a serious rich-get-richer problem.

I liked the game, but I don't think anyone else did. I think this is a game that will take several plays to get the nuances of when to take your influence and win to place it.

RATING: 5
The epitome of a rich-get-richer game which relies on the losers communicating and allying together to leader bash enough to give them a chance to get back into the hunt. You get cards equal to your VPs. These can be spent efficiently investing in home territories to boost your VP's (ie get more cards), or inefficiently to invade neutrals or other players (you have to pay a "distance" cost with your cards). Or you can spend the cards on tech advances that either boost your defence (other players have to pay more to whack you) or on offense to eliminate the "distance" inefficiency cost. So the question each turn, with your limited cards, is whether to invest for more cards next turn (setting yourself up as a target though) or invest in techs to boost your defence / offense or go out whacking to obtain the neutrals you need to win. While this provides a semi-interesting decision, the game devolves to who whacks who and who doesn't get whacked. The techs might help in that decision, but if everyone's investing at roughly the same pace (as they should, otherwise they're setting themselves up as targets by going ahead in VPs but without defence), the result should be a pretty random fallout of the whack-fest. It's not a genre I get a lot of joy from.

Easy to learn, and provides a lot of strategic options.  Some claim there are some balance issues with the factions, but I haven't had a problem with that.  Which countries come out (and their order) is a big source of strategy and game-to-game variation, but this random element may benefit some players more than others.  Components are poor.  The game is a lot of fun, though.

I enjoy the short playing time... what I don't enjoy is the harshness of the cardsystem. If someone falls behind in the beginning it is impossible for him to catch up.

If this is just an occurrance with 3 players than I don't advise playing with that number.

I hope that in a 4 or 5 player game the beginning of the game is slower and more balanced - and hope to get to test that in the near future.

Edit: In a four player game the beginning is slower and definitely more balanced. But to increase my rating, I yet have to play a couple of more times

(1 play) Finally played this one.  A 5-player game that took about 2 hours.  The learning curve was steep.  Actually, it turned out that if we read the rules carefully enough, everything was explained satisfactorily.  No rules holes, but there are a number of "obvious" things that I wish were stated more directly.  We solved all the rules riddles to consensus agreement by the end of the game.  Really, you have to play the game to understand what some of the rules even talk about.  4 players agreed that this game has serious possibilities for an intense ideological battle.  Player 5 may play again, but I won't be placing any bets.  After years on the shelf - I just don't see breaking this one out again.

It doesn't really have a board, just tiles for different countries, but there's a map because they're defined as "near" each other or not. Basically the game is about managing three card resources - culture, economics and military. They are used to influence the countries, or to upgrade into developments that improve the ability to influence. Seems like the game comes down to whoever tips the balance of power with the right draw at the end.

Played it for the first time at my FLG in a free demo by Z-Man who the donated the game as a store copy.  What is not to love about that.  It had some interesting mechanics but overall fell flat.  There didn't seem to be enough to retard the leader and the alliance track was awkward.

Fun game.  Good deal.  Played at Prezcon 04.  Simple game play but it really comes down strategy.  I snuck up while the Imperialists and Fascists fought each other and won as the Islamic Fundamentalists, while the Communists were stuck with no way to go abroad and the Capitalists were on my side, haha.  Made my friend buy a copy so I can play it often.  Each game is different.

Game bogs down as players cycle through their turns out of seating order. If players are on the ball and know the rules well then it should play fairly smoothly, but not smoothly enough. It's tricky for new players to keep track of the individual powers of the ideologies and their advancement cards. The mechanism is simple. It's up to the players to create balance and fun. Much like with the game War on Terror, I think with the right group this could be a really good game, providing fun, laughs, threats and general light entertainment. It'll depend on your group's gaming tastes. For me it's hard to see this being played over other games on my shelf as there's no dearth of five player 90 minute games. Oh, and Tasmania is NOT part of New Zealand.

I like it a lot so far, but suspect it will pale with multiple plays.  I'd love to try with all five players.  Every game I've played so far has been very close.  I'm not sure if this is because we were all playing equally well, or because it doesn't really matter how you play.

1st play at Origins with the designer giving the demo in '04. Another play in 2008 confirmed initial impression: Neat idea, but goes on way too long. Also, some problems with randomness (luck of the card draw in terms of location close to starting country) and pace (slow!). Plus: components are not that great, and the game takes up a lot of space!

In the 2nd game, we'd only gone through a few of the region cards ... is that how it's supposed to be? I like the idea of the game, but it seems to need some tweaking. Once you're behind it seems you can't really catch up. And getting ahead is largely random, depending on which cards come up for colonization. A quick scan of the 2nd edition rules showed that there are a bunch of variants there that might make the game better. Unfortunately, I'm not sure it's worth the time investment. Trade anyone?

RATING: 6
Difficult to catch the leader unless everyone else colludes to gang up on him.  I'm also not enthralled with the idea of only one new country entering play each round.  Still, I somewhat enjoyed it as a newcomer to wargames, and I'd play it again, but my rating would be more likely to fall than rise.

RATING: 4
Based on one play, I think my rating is quite likely unfair. Only afterwards did it strike me that we must have been playing it wrong. The owner suggested we play without diplomacy to make it easier, because in his earlier games everyone inevitably ended up at war anyway. This carried over to a lack of diplomacy in general -- it was every man for himself. The problem is that conflict is required to arrest runaway leaders, but conflict is less efficient than other types of card use: it's a prisoner's dilemma requiring players to co-operate. It seems like, to play this game right, table talk and alliances are not only encouraged but required.

I still don't like it mechanically, since it's clunky and manages the feat of seeming both over-abstracted (war is boring!) and over-complicated (keeping track of 8 special ideology characteristics) at the same time. It would be better with if it used a board rather than tiles and something other than cards for influence, so the spatial relationships between territories were visible.

I believe than an objective of 12 is purely a marketing decision.  They want the most people buying the game so this imply short-span games.

I strongly suggest a minimum objective of 15.  You'll get to play with more cards, regions, more fun !

Sincerely one of the greatest games designed, just for its simplicity still it reflects very nicely complex geopolitical situations (you need a little imagination).

One of the worst written rulebooks I've EVER seen (1st edition), but the game itself appears solid. Just be prepared to go through the rulebook at least twice before understanding.  I'd suggest trying a turn or two as practice as well.

Sold through a local game store's flea market in an attempt to get some space back in our house.

RATING: 3
Solid game.  Simple set of rules construct a framework with a wide variety of meaningful decisions.  LOTS of player interaction, diplomacy, and conflict.

The only downside to the game is you have perfect information available.  As one player nears the finish line, all players conspire to drag that person back as the pack moves toward victory.  This results in a very tense last couples of turns as all the players are close and attempt to get over the top.

For you wargamers out there, the progression to victory is much like Here I Stand

Played 2nd edition.  Nice idea but doesn't seem very well executed.  A bit too complex rules-wise for what is a simple concept at its heart. Entire game is about creating a runaway leader and I could foresee it getting very nasty, especially with more players (we played with 3 and it was relatively sedate).

\13\\13\
Each Ideology will use economic, cultural, and military influence to bring countries under control. If a player has influence in a country in which you have influence, you can both engage in economic, cultural, and military conflict (depending on your diplomatic stance toward each other) to knock out your opponent's influence. You can also purchase Advancements like Propaganda, Tactics, etc. to make it harder for an opponent to conflict you or to make it easier for you to influence a country.

The goal is to posses a Global Influence of 12 or more.

This appears to be a game where more plays would increase the fun factor.  The first game played was fun; however, everyone seemed to only be out for themself not really paying attention to what was going on in the rest of the world.  Nearly everyone was at peace during the entire game; an early leader came out and no one wanted to gang up on her until it was too late.  After the game the comments were that there needed to be more aggressive play.

Relatively dull mechanics that relate only tangentially to the theme. It also has a run-away leader problem and depends on rote strategy to some degree. I don't hate this game, but it leaves me cold.

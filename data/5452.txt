Big. Detailed. Somewhat fiddly special rules. But OCS works pretty well in North Africa. Granted, it’s big enough that few gamers will ever spread the whole thing out for a campaign – but that’s what digital gaming aids like ADC2 and Cyberboard are for, right?

just an Awesome game! The mobility of the german Panzer, the unlimited Supply for the commonwealth force the two camp to adapt their strategy each other. I almost feel the sun on my skin and the dust in my throat when I play!

Got the old version.  Easy to upgrade.  Just as enjoyable as DAK II.  Got a buddy hooked on OCS with this one.  Even though he was the Italians in Operation Compass!
Simply, a great game.  Go with 2 if you can get it, but 1st version is fine.

If I could get this on the table in 2017 I'd be very happy (using the downloadable DAK2 rules with the DAK1 components). 2018 is more likely.

5 maps in a row.  Just too big.  I think there was a way to abstract one of them away, but that still left 4 maps in a row, way too big for normal human living spaces.

RATING: 9
A good operational wargame with streamlined rules and quite a few medium sized scenarios, the grand campaign will take a very long time to play though and will take up a lot of space.

Best OCS game... not many counters so you can manage the whole things without getting crazy

RATING: 9
Very good OCS title, probably the only BIG ONE manageable enough for the average wargamers in order to play 1 vs 1. I tried various  campaign scenarios and they were all entrateining. The campaign is simply a blast. Try it if you can. Highly recomended. DAK 2 put some things in order but you can have the same fun with the old one (if you find a copy).

I have played this game a few times, and although it is huge it is very managable, because all those counters included are actually never at the same time in play.

A relatively manageable "mini-monster" OCS game.  Counter density is fairly light, so 2 players can move it along reasonably quickly.  I sat for a turn or two with two people who were playing it in open gaming at WBC.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While improved by DAK 2, this is perhaps the best game to showcase the logistical aspects of the Operational Combat Series.  Because of the low counter density, this is a very accessible game in the series and very popular.

My first OCS game! I just snagged a copy on eBay and while I wanted the second edition the original was cheaper by a good few hundred dollars so there wasn't much of a contest. Can't wait to try it out even if it does mean adding another lengthy rulebook to my table.

The OCS system is perfection here! If you are the Allies in the campaign game, make sure you wipe out the Italian arty right away! Not that I found out what happens if you don't ;-)

Got to walk through a small scenario of the OCS system and I like it... the focus is all on supply. The first edition has poor color differentiation for the Germans who look brown/tan as do the Brits.

RATING: N/A
One of the few OCS series game that I wanted but I didn't, because of the limited print run by The Gamers/ MMP.  DAK portrays the Desert War focusing on Rommel operations in Libya and Egypt.  Given the popularity of OCS and Rommel, the game is sure an item mostly sought after.  DAK II has been released and I own a copy of that.  Check my comments there.

The Battle that OCS could correctly simulate. The rest of the series just don't seem to work (the scale is very wrong). Alas, this game takes too much time to play. But still, if you are interested in the OCS system, this is the one (and only) you should buy.

The campaign game is huge but very playable (and by one player a side).  The random events and the ebb and flow of the strategic situation really give a very strong impression of what it must have been like at the time.

Numerous shorter scenarios for those who don't have the time or the space for the entire campaign.

Just got the game...brand new! I give this a 7 just from looking through the rules quickly. Maps &amp; counters are magnificent. I&#039;ll update once I start playing the game. Have started learning to play the game...a few game turns into it. Having a hard time getting a grip on the supply rules so if anyway can enlighten me I would be forever in your debt.

I don't like OCS, by any measure. Too long, too belaboured, too many silly bits.

But, boy oh boy, did Essig get it right with DAK. I have played several small scenarios and each was a joy to play, going down to the last phase, or even the last dice roll.

A masterpiece.

A really playable monster wargame.  This would look awesome fully set up if I only had the space.  small counter density means turns move quicker than most OCS games.

OCS Best thing since sliced bread. The detail is incredible. The biggest problem I have is I can't pitch it to my monster game group. The narrow front means there aren't enough toys to go around. Yet the monster game overhead is pretty steep for just two. Maybe four?

Only played once (problem of space in my flat) from the beginning to december 41. Definitely a GREAT game. What a challenge : more than 2 years of campaign   forcing any player to change his way of managing a wargame (long term planning).

A playable monster game?  Well, it&#039;s not as quick as Rommel in the Desert, but it&#039;s more playable than most other monster games (if you&#039;ve got the space - 3x8 table at least).  DAK is part of the "Operational Combat Series", which emphasizes supply management and mobilty.  It&#039;s a bit unorthodox, which may give some hardcore wargamers pause, but I&#039;d say it&#039;s the best operational combat game system out there, and DAK is one of the best games in the series.

An awesome game of the OCS-system that incorporates everything you can think of about the desert campaign. OCS is very well suited to simulate desert warfare. The only gripe I have with the game is the british historical withdrawal rules which complicates and bogs down the game. Luckily there is a random withdrawal system that solves this problem. This game is one of my favorite WWII games and is highly recommended

Unpunched but not quite mint.  Very good condition.  Box is slightly scuffed and Volume III of the rules has footprint on it.  First edition (DAK not DAK 2).

RATING: 7
Sure it's got all the trivia, the chrome, the giant map, the insignificant details, etc, etc, but the OCS overall system doesn't seem well suited for this theater.  It seems like every time I play it against a competent opponent, who doesn't care about following historical events and tactics, it ends in stalemate with two large entrenched armies facing each other somewhere between Tobruk and El Alamein and unable to breakthrough the other.  The tendency seems to be to conduct a safe slow buildup and a safe solid wall push/defense, as opposed to the historically characteristic high risk, high maneuver thrusts that seemingly teetered between victory and defeat.  It may not be as flawed as CNA, but neither is it the last word and ultimate wargame of the north Africa theater.  Not as good as several other OCS titles.

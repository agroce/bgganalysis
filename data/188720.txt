This really didn't click with us which was a shame as we love escape rooms and games and have done all in this genre. Puzzles didn't make much sense (even with solutions), flow of story a bit confused. I wouldn't recommend.

Kickstarted 1st edition.  Overall pretty fun and some nice surprises.  The quality of the puzzles was a pedestrian and would have preferred a bit more thematic integration.

Amazingly fun game, and can be reset to be played again.  The one drawback is that it suffers from the usual problem with room escape games, you can only play it once, and until you forget all the puzzles you won't be able to play it again.  However, I am having fun moderating the game as well for other groups so this one will continue to bring me fun even though I am not technically playing it.

Outstanding escape room game.  Mostly simple puzzles but there are a couple (I'm looking at you werewolf picture) that are tough.  Had a great time playing through it.

UV light was dead, which ruined the experience. Obviously, you can only play through once yourself, but it's not really likely you'll be able to reset and share the experience with someone else.  There were some good puzzles, but some disappointing ones as well (a word search?). Didn't like how there was no payoff for finishing a puzzle - it was more of a checkmark.  Compare that to some of the EXIT games where finishing one puzzle unlocks others.

Out of the escape room board games, not the best one for sure. The hype was there, the price was hefty, and it just doesn't deliver. Some of the puzzles are mediocre at best, some parts are cool though.

A fun escape room in a box, all werewolf themed and decked out with real locks and something that needs water.....We solved it in an hour and 10 min with 1 clue (20 min remaining), and that was also with the extra time awarded for solving a certain puzzle. This was the kickstarter version I was lucky enough to play!

Of course, my rating here is not really "excellent game, always want to play it," because it is an escape room in a box, and has no replay value.  That said, it was an excellent escape room experience with great components far beyond decks of cards that I am very glad I played, and my favorite of all the escape room box games I have played to date.

RATING: 6
As a Danish speaker (with good English; working in a highly international academic environment), I found many of the puzzles too dependent on English and/or English/American lingual and cultural finesses. In short, the game was so hard for us that I thought it took away from the experience. I also didn't enjoy the fact that we were almost forced to solve several of the puzzles in separate mini-teams; it made it difficult to get an overview of what needed to be done and it detracted from the team spirit of things. (We were a team of 5, and this was our first escape-room-in-a-box experience.)
I am hesitant to forward this game to friends and family, as I am not sure they will enjoy it, purely based on difficulty (for Danish speakers). I will definitely recommend ditching the timer and playing with no more than 4 players.

The writing in this game is really bizarre and all over the place.  The physical nature of the locks and puzzles is fascinating vs the card based systems and this is one of the few escape rooms I've played that can keep a large group occupied.  A particular tool available near the start of it is also a brilliant addition to any escape room.

I was ready to hate this after the looooong Kickstarter delivery delay and my general feeling that some of these escape room games are a bit overrated.(Yes, I'm looking at you, Unlock).

This box wouldn't let me hate it, though. Really clever, varied components -- a hugely satisfying ride. We beat it with four minutes to spare. Now we can't wait to watch our friends play it!

Pure co-op escape room. Kickstarter version ($45) released 2017-08, but it has been picked up by Mattel, with release expected late 2017 for $29.

Do not get me wrong - this is not a bad game per se, and I did have a TON of fun playing it, but that is more due to the crowd and the experience.  I know this is a polarizing opinion, and it is my own and I fully accept I may be in the minority, but it is a personal thing.  In my opinion, it is less a game and more of an interactive puzzle experience.  I know, I know - that could easily be the definition of a game, but it just is not what I look for in a game.  Was fun, would do it again on occasion, but just not my cup of tea.  As much as I love coops you would think I would love it, but I want brain teaser puzzles at particular times, and it is not what I go to game nights for.

It's always tough to rate these sort of things, since it is, by its very nature, a one-shot deal.  Sure, it can be reset and passed on or used in another context, but the individual can't really do it again.
But it's much closer to replicating a "real" Escape Room than many of its competitors and for that it deserves considerable credit.  
The actual content was fine, but I'm not the typical target audience for this sort of thing (let me put it this way - I did it solo inside the hour...)  
So I've giving it a 9 because it is in the top rank of this genre.  But the BGG scale is entirely inappropriate for it.

RATING: 5
It was fair, but disappointing after all of the hype.   The puzzles were uninspired...   a search a word, dot to dot, and a crossword???   I much prefer the Stargazer's manor for a professional escape room game or escape the Crate for a subscription.   Those are much closer to real escape rooms.   Overall, it wasn't a bad game for puzzles, but if you are in the mood for an escape room, go elsewhere.

Perfect activity for a small group of people.

It is in English, which makes it easier for those whose mother tongue is that language.

The puzzles themselves are on the easy side, but they are not simple.

Played this with a total of 5 players. We all solved different parts of the puzzles that others could not get. Don't think we could have done it with any 4 of us. Looking forward to reset it and watch another group play it.

Some clever use of components allow this to be more of an escape room experience. I also like the refill pack option.

Our playing time was roughly 45 minutes with two hints used. There was especially one puzzle we struggled with.

Coop party game with a theme and puzzle solving. A return of the old dinner murder mystery game nights updated with the Legacy style board gaming excitement. Even if this was a one-off, this concept could be a smash hit craze.

RATING: 4.3
Good production values (real locks, etc) but many of the puzzles were lacklustre. Also, one of the components was faulty (and likely irreparable for many groups). Anyone looking for an escape room experience would be better advised to buy the Exit games, which provide a better experience at a fraction of the cost. My copy came with a reset kit, which I thought would justify the cost but I'm unsure of whether it's worth the effort.

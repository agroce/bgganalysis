A good-ish game with BEAUTIFUL collectible components. I am selling off my 40k stuff, but I will hang on to the small army of minis I collected for this game simply because they are so stinking pretty. I knocked Elrond out of the park, and he's something that I am proud of. 

If you like painting and LOTR, you might enjoy the game - might. The game itself is pretty clunky.

Great, quick skirmish game if you're a LOTRs fan. Love the thematic, story-driven scenarios as I can't stand army vs army minis games.

RATING: 7
I looked into this game because I found Warhammer Fantasy Battle far far too complicated. LotR is perfect for small skirmishes and larger battles, as it uses a nice basic system without a lot of thrills. It fits of the movies and the books reasonably well. If you want to play a fantasy wargame but not get too bogged down, then is is the one for you.

RATING: 6
My few plays of this were more fun than I had playing 40k with about 1/20th the time investment required to learn. I was REALLY into LotR when this was released and had friends who bought a ton of the miniatures so I could play using their sets.

RATING: 7
Loved the highly detailed minis & the whole gaming system.. Although, price of components and having to paint the minis, were definitely cons for me..

RATING: 6
Pros :
High quality miniatures
Decent rules
One of the best themes in gaming in general

Cons :
Games Workshop....money grabbing company intent on hooking you in for high priced expansions & overpriced miniatures
You can counter an opponent by simply buying a better army....what's the point in that? so people spend more money and the rich always win & Games Workshop profits which let's face it has always been their main concern, rarely listening to it's fanbase

Suggested Max Worth : Â£50

I have painted so many miniatures for this its not even funny. I should really start taking some pictures of them all and putting them on the Geek. Its a fun game and the models look great. When playing it some times turns into a dice rolling afair as everyone is locked into combat.

Super simple mechs that deliver a challenging tactical game. This aint no bring and battle though you gotta respect the fluff. The figs are a 10++. If wasn't for the paintin' and terrain parts this game would be a ten.

PS - since discovering the VOTR vassal module for this game I'm changing my rating to a ten. Right now, at this moment its possible that i am the most satisfied gamer on the planet.

RATING: 8
Latest version solidifies a system that had a few growing pains.  One of my favourite skirmish games.  Rules breakdown if forces get too large (many dice rolls to get to the point of a grunt living or dying).  Rules are really good for sieges.  Wide variety of scenarios available through supplements.  Miniatures are some of the best I've seen even though the metals are very pricy.  Miniatures have served well for DnD.

RATING: 8
Nice minis and a good introductory game to wargaming. Nice that it plays as skirmish so you don't have to collect and paint a ton of minis. Might seem a bit too simple for experienced wargamers though, with not a lot of options for equiping your characters. Also minus one point for the dreaded GW prices of the minis.

RATING: N/A
The battle system in this is kind of light (highest dice roll wins) and the appeal for me really is the LotR theme. I have quite a few painted figures, even some terrain, but my experience with this has shown me that i'm really not a miniature wargamer in the sense of the GW styled games.

I will finish my Army someday, and I want to build some more terrain, but at the moment this is on hold. 

I'd probably play this if I had opponents who also had their own armies. I just can't afford to build two armies so that my friend(s) will also have one to play with.

Initially I just bought a bunch of units I liked (Uruk Hai, Orcs, etc) based on my love for Tolkien. But with the release of the "Legions of Middle Earth" supplement i found out i was really boned so far as making a correctly "themed army." 

So for now i'll have to field my hybrid Sauron/Isengard/Moria army (they're all evil, doesn't matter to me).

I'm an unabashed super-fan of this game.  The theme is wonderful, the tight rules system allows for limitless possibilities when designing and playing scenarios.  The miniatures are getting more expensive, but it is still the most reasonably priced miniatures game in the Games Workshop stable.  

I can honestly say that I have never played a bad game of LotR: SBG.

RATING: 7
Miniature based war game, similar to Warhammer but adapted to the Lord of the Rings universe. I quite enjoyed it during its release, it had streamlined rules, easy to understand, highly strategic and balanced. Was very thematic in relation to the books and movies, having some very interesting character abilities and stats. Miniatures were excellent, of which I collected for a little while, however eventually didn't want to commit to the game any more 2007 onwards. Took too much time and financial investment, also finding other players became more difficult.

I own only Mines of Moria starter set and that's enough for me. As I write this, War of the Ring has already come out and now that I have everything I need with this game, let's move on to that.

The MoM-set is simple but provides excellent tools for some miniature goodness. It was fun to paint those minis!

Simple rules for a miniatures game. Plays quick and simple, but has good strategy. I love the theme and relatively cheap prices. 

Armies are a bit to similar to each other to make it an stand-out game.

RATING: 6
One of the best miniaturs games to play with your kids. Rules are easy to learn, and not many games have big budget movies to put some life into the theme. Simple rules and random enough that even bit less experienced gamer can win. Maybe not best for true miniwargamer's tastes though.

Games Workshop. Two Towers and Return of the King starters. Rohan heroes and a handful of evil characters, plus the Fellowship.

My miniatures system of choice. Simple rules, smaller armies, and a great theme. Unlike the other Games Workshop miniatures systems, this one uses many less units, which means a lot less money spent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Simple, but with some more to it that at first glance. The ability to modify into other fantastical, historical, and even sci-fi settings improve the ratings of the game. While the rules are still very good, when the manufacturer of the game stopped producing metal miniatures, there was no incentive to continue collecting figures for play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game was interesting, and had some good asymmetrical tactical gameplay.  There were a few rules which, while simplistic enough to be understandable the first time you play, were really quite difficult to implement in practice.  For instance, to determine whether your figure has line of sight to another figure, you need to crouch down and look from behind your figure to the figure in question-- if you can see the figure's body (arms, legs, head, and torso), then you have line of sight.  That's fine, but often terrain blocks the place you need to put your head in, preventing you from actually making this determination.

Great skirmish game. Really captures the feel of heroic characters wading through armies of minions. (Although that sort of thing is generally used as a criticism of games, i.e. "HeroHammer" I feel it is quite appropriate for this material.)

I grew up playing, collecting, painting, customizing and even tweaking the rules for this game (ok, so the latter was mostly done by a mate of mine, but they were damn good and helped speed up the gameplay). I have fond memories of the battles we recreated such as Minas Tirith and Helms Deep, full with hand sculpted castles and painted miniatures. Yes, the game was slow, and often unbalanced because we modded the rules and instead of going for points based battles (which were still tense and fun) wanted the biiig sweeping epics, but this really was 'Lord of the Rings: The Game' for me. Back when I used to play games for the thematic experience (and had my butt whooped because I was playing 'thematically') this was the game that brought a beloved theme to life. And I will always cherish my experience of  it.

I have played the Balin's Tomb scenario couple of times in the past, when the One Rulebook was released.

Rated and updated after the most recent play, about 7-8 years after the last plays. Rather good game, we used the War band rules and generic scenario from one of the expansion books. I hope to play this more in the future. Second play quite recently, still feels good.

Updated after third War band rules games, I like really much. The rules are rather simple and difference between forces and models are mostly made by variation in the stat line rather than by large amount of special rules.

Fifth play behind, still very nice. I need to try different forces next time.

Same old forces again, but now three plays with historic scenarios. They are not symmetric and may be not so balanced, but may be more interesting and fun.

And then one point match with new opponent. Very nice game.

Much sentimental value to me after years spent collecting and frequenting tournaments. I recognize there being superior titles among SBGs, but will never have the time and energy required to delve into another one, while I would gladly play a few rounds of LOTR at some point.

I actually really liked this tabletop skirmishing game at the time I played Warhammer 40K a lot. It was a nice breath of fresh air. Not having to move a lot of miniatures and that you could move each figure individually if you really wanted. I can still see me getting that game to the table as it's easier to cope for newer people than running a small Warhammer 40K game.

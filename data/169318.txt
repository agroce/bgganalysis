Lots of fun and I like the mix of hand management, semi blind bidding and card powers.  Played one 2 and two 4 player games.  Wish the memory element was slightly less but its not there so much to be a problem.  I do think some people (particularly non gamers) will struggle to absorb all the rules and get enough of a sense of how all the concepts mesh together to fully enjoy their first game but even a poor showing in the first round wont completely scupper your chances as it can with some games and I dont think it will take that much playing for people to make sense of it.

A surprisingly "deep" game as there are a lot of combos to think through. 
Wow, this went totally unnoticed by me until a buddy introduced it to me. 

For something so simple and short, that only takes 15 minutes to explain, the game is a brain burner. A huge return on investment of explanation time & rule set TO its gameplay.
To top it off, it is quite thematic to boot. 

I feel the tension in every move, and I'm invested in the gameplay. 

The four player game seems to be slightly more cutthroat than the three player because you're fighting over six spies. In a three player game, it is natural to settle for 2 spies per player, while in a four player game, you cannot split six spies evenly. 
We play with a house rule that in a 3 player game, we only play 3 rounds. We feel that every player should have equal turns at having the hammer.

Zero BGG buzz about this awesome title, which is an injustice. 
This is THE sleeper under-the-radar Game of the Year for 2016. Textbook definition of a hidden gem.

Very solid implementation of theme, it truly captures the essence of tactical espionage. Lots to think about and each rounds end presents a great opportunity for advanced planning. Could be a brain burn for some. Well done. Can't wait to play with four!

**Update lowered score. Not a 4 player game at all. Best with 2 and no more.

This one really surprised me, I was not expecting to like all of the double guessing involved in it but the decisions are so good. Between the combination of where to place your spies, the special actions of the location tiles and the spies, the variability of the locations changing from round to round, and having decide which 6 spies to keep not only for the next round but knowing those are the only 6 spies that score more than 1 point  led to some great game moments. While I played with 3, I could also see this working with 2 fairly well, which I did not think would work well after reading the rules. I was really expecting Covert to be the spy game I'd really like and while I haven't played that one yet this was highly enjoyable.

RATING: 3
An exceptionally disappointing set of mechanics applied to some incredible production quality & artwork.

Simply put playing this with 2/3 ended up with each and every person being able to read the best cards for each tile, and the best bluffs at what point, and...it  was too simple for what it was? Other games in the same ballpark possess much more depth without the irritating clean-up inbetween turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting action sequencing and bluffing game, with special abilities, majority scorings etc. I really am not very fond of point-salad games and multiple majorities usually give me a headache if not cleanly done. Here however, there is some real design quality and innovation, which a fun end result. Still, there is a strong memory element in terms of acquired cards and their abilities, which can make or break an individual strategy and which makes me less happy to play the game again. In addition, the cards may or may not be well-balanced, one can only hope they are.

One of the best games designed by Portuguese designers. It's a very tough, cutthroat game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Really very difficult to play to win, this game. There are far too many unknowns to deal with when placing the spies, at least in the 4 player-game, thus ruining any I think that you think that I think-ponderings and giving the subsequent evaluation all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Small differences in influence can exacerbate into large influence and VP differences, at which point playing the game is no longer fun nor appealing for the lagging-behind players. The game does not allow for catching up in any way. Adding insult to injury there is also a ton of multiplexing going on: spies have many special abilities, and the locations where they are placed too... and trying to keep track of who does what under those circumstances is simply futile. I am reminded here of the horrible game Justinian by Leo Colovini which suffered from a rather similar issue. (If you've never heard of Justinian: keep it that way.)

The game gets a meager bonus for possibly handling a bit better at the lower player counts; but even here I have my doubts as to the longevity of it all. Speaking for myself I don't mind not ever playing this again. There are games with cleaner blind bidding systems available.

The theme and the artwork are great and very amusing.

Although some nice ideias, the core mechanics of the game lie in almost abolute "shots in the dark". Futhermore, the several powers/habilities of the characters present in the game (which, by the way, are based on real persons) forces the players to always pursuit "elusive shadows", never beeing sure about what they are doing.
I would like to be much more found of this game but i`m afraid that is not the case.

Interesting game of bidding with spies instead of money. Depending on where you place your spy, you might get to see more of the information involved in the auction. Explaining the game and how the various spies work takes longer than actually playing a round of the game. How you manipulate turn order and the board to leverage the spies you have is interesting. I would play the game again but it's not a must have. Took around 45 minutes for our 3 player game.

For us, I think this game is best at two players.  It's two players controlling more board state and being able to chain together various abilities (or not, because someone anticipated a move!) to achieve a result.  You have far less control the more players you add and it becomes more randomish rather than two players matching wits.

At two it can be very fun and satisfying.  At 4 it can far more activity than game.

Interesting 'worker placement' area control game where your workers are the cards in hand, and the areas you control gain you cards to hand, before the board resets each round.

I like the hand management aspect however there is a win more mechanic in that the more cards you win the more powerful your deck therefore the more cards you can win. 

The end goals also seem very very powerful as 8 points is a large swing, since most cards give you 1-3 VP. In the game we played we had a massive range of scores and a runaway leader from turn two. 

Game is short and fairly quick and I do like the 'top secret' aspect whereby some cards are played face down and others face up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
To and fro tussle.  Simplistic and chaos at one level but a number of hidden strategies come through with experience so there is far more going on than suspected. Just like actually recruiting a spy network in fact - no place for amateurs

RATING: 7
City of Spies is an ultimately very simple cross of area control and set collection. What sets it apart from many other games using these mechanisms is that it is recklessly interactive, and not only with regards to the area control aspects per se which is par for the course for this kind of game. Instead, the board locations interlock with the spy abilities which interact with both your own and other players' spies (and not always in ways that you like).
Combine all these interaction points with some blind bidding, and you (unsurprisingly) get quite a bit of chaos. If that's something you can handle, the game is a refreshingly light-hearted romp through the world of espionage and international intrigue.

Lange her, dass das Wort Geheimtipp so gut gepasst hat wie hier: Unscheinbar im Schatten der Jahrgangsneuheiten 2016 und thematisch stimmig im Dunkelreich der Spionage des Zweiten Weltkrieges, hat sich ESTORIL 1942 in meiner Sammlung in die Abteilung "Originell" geschlichen. Als profanes Area Control Game getarnt, weckt ESTORIL eine vergessene Art ein Spiel zu denken, welches das Thema Agenten organisch transportiert und sich dabei sehr dynamisch um ein paar eigene Achsen dreht: Auf Schauplatztafeln im mondänen portugiesischen Städtchen Estoril mit speziellen Skills, befinden sich drei Einsatzfelder mit speziellen Skills, auf die man seine Spione einsetzt, die spezielle Skills haben - dass alles bezieht sich sehr angenehm aufeinander mit bisschen Deduktion und viel Interaktion. Was sich kompliziert getextet anhört, spielt sich schnell in einer satten halben Stunde und auf eine eloquente Zockerweise fordernder als man zunächst vermutet. Die Spannung im Spiel spiegelt sich auch visuell wieder: farbentsättigte, real trashige Originalschaulätze kontern mit den funny Faces der Spione auf den Charaktertafeln und geben dem Spiel die passende Optik. Der Designer kommt logischerweise aus dem Ostblock. KGB, bitte an den Spieltisch!

Pure fun.  A fairly simple game where tiles are placed either face up or down onto the board. Love the theme about espionage during WWII in Portugal- and despite the game's simplicity, it is well felt. There's a lot of second-guessing as to what opponents have played- a lot of bluffing. Each area on the board provides a special ability to the characters placed there. So between the characters special abilities, and those granted by areas (on the board), there's actually some real thinking to do. Great fun and quite underrated, as many games are on BGG. I would expect this to be in the top 600 or so, at least.

A very AP-prone game. Lots of hidden information--maybe too much--which leads a great amount of uncertainty and the general inability to execute a plan predictably. Given that, it's not clear what the best strategies are, but high strength seems key, and seduction seems quite strong in the later game (if you can guarantee empty spots on a location). The game hit me a bit negatively because of this, but I'm willing to try again. We played with 4, and it might be a bit better at 2 or 3.

Ultra-underrated game on bgg.

--

One quibble - the graphics on the sectors is not distinctive enough.  You cannot say at first glance what a specific sector is, not to mention his ability.  The icons aimed at reminding it are small and easily covered by placed agents.  The readability of the board should be much better in this aspect.

EDIT: Amazing.  Better and better with every play...  Rating up.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (December 2016)

My desire to play City of Spies: Estoril 1942 was low but not for any particular reason. The name didn’t call for me but I’m glad I played it, it is a great family game and an ok gamer´s game.

The rules aren’t complex, you can explain the game under 12 minutes. The art is very cool and the game components are ok, although they are easily damaged.

City of Spies: Estoril 1942 is a cool game with very interesting decisions, namely, where to play your cards, which card to play and which cards to keep in your hand. The game in not obvious in any way and you need to constantly analyze your opponents moves. I really like it!

Replayability seems high because in each round the board will be changed, so there are many combos available.

Bottom line, I will perhaps buy it, City of Spies: Estoril 1942 is very close to being a good game for me. The decisions aren’t trivial and I like it! Perhaps it is an underrated game because I haven’t heard much bout it.

One play only. After explaining it and playing the first round, the looks around the table said 'unconvinced' - at first glance it doesn't sound like much of a game.

However, once you've seen a few more rounds you start to understand how the spatial, timing and scoring elements come together to create a simple but intriguing game that is a lot better than the bare bones might suggest.

In City Of Spies: Estoril 1942, players are competing against each other to form the most powerful and influential secret organization of spies. Based on historical facts, the game takes place on famous locations in Estoril.

Six locations are randomly selected to be used for the first round, such as casinos, hotels, beaches, etc. Control of these will be fought over in each of the four rounds of the game. Special Agents are then placed on each location as the reward for who have the most influence on that location.

Das Spiel ist eigentlich ganz gut. Die Symbolik selbst habe ich nicht auf die Reihe bekommen (welches Symbol heisst was darf ich anschauen???). Das Bluffelement (Ein Element das ich sehr liebe) hält sich durch die anschauerrei auch in Grenzen. Wird dann schon fasst zum Memoryelement (Eines das ich nicht gut kann).
Das Spiel hat mich beim ersten Mal nicht überzeugt, aber vielleicht wird es beim zweiten/dritten Mal besser.
Der Verwaltungsaufwand, jedes Mal das Brett neu auszulegen ist auch hoch, muss aber sein, damit sich andere Konstellationen ergeben.
Naja......... die Haptik der Teile ist toll. Es sind nicht einfach nur Spionkarten, sondern schön dicke Plättchen und den Siegpunktmechanismus finde ich toll. Das was auf der Hand ist bringt gut Punkte... Die Rentner eben nur noch Beiwerk. Das finde ich super gelöst. Jetzt muss mir nur noch das Spielen selbst Spaß machen ;)

An intriguing puzzle/area-control game for 2-4 players about spies taking over and recruiting more spies in the city of Estoril, Spain in 1942.

Although the rules are streamlined and refined, the game is surprisingly fiddly and relies primarily on hidden information. With few ways of gaining meaningful information, the whole game feels very luck-based instead of deceitful or clever.

I honestly never heared of this game before until a costumer of mine asked me to order this for him. Gladly I could play with his copy, because this is a fun game, short, enough strategy involved and tense as most of the spies you put down are face down. By far the best designed game from Gil d'Orey

As i was playing this game I thought it was okay.  But when I thought about it and the way it could be played my enjoyment icreaed.  I would love to play this game again. I think there should be a few more location tiles as there are only 8 and 6 are used.  I think an additional 4 would have made this game a little better.  More variety
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really clever bluffing game to try and take majorities in regions to gain agents. There are goals to try and meet for final agent counts and it is super fun to try and make it all work by conspiracy and lure and maybe a few assassinations. I really enjoy this title and look forward to a lot more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not a fan of area majority because it is an accounting experience but thankfully Estoril seems like single digits affair, but interesting here is that the mechanism is used as a recruitment drive to increase your influence. 

The resolution of the majorities isn't El Grande dry, the spy effects can mess up planning and lead to (I suspect) fun situations.

But my biggest concern is the amount of memory work involved as to what spies are held or possibly placed, as well as the detail abilities of the spies; this might make it a disengaging wear on the brain.

The visuals and mechanisms seem to add intrigue/turn of events to the spy theme, based on an historical location.

Good, tense and fun game of second-guessing. There is a lot of hidden info (very thematic!), but there are also a lot of ways to mitigate that depending on the where the player chooses to  place agents. Only real downside is its somewhat unbalanced scoring system. And, as usual with most multiplayer games, players should try to be very aware of who is in the lead in the final one or two rounds as to try to counter some of that player's moves (which, in City of Spies, is harder to assess than in most other multiplayer games).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even though the game is filled with assassins shooting eachother's faces off, it's really not a mean game at all. Turns out getting your face shot off just sends you home without collecting your free espionagerie of gift bags. Recruiting new spies and constantly swapping out your crew is like a super tight and effective deck-builder. Great surprise! A surpise of spies! A surspries!

RATING: 7
Fascinated by this game, but can't clearly describe what I like about it. It's different enough to be unlike any other game I've played, short enough to work as filler and the simple rules work together to bring a challenging level of complexity.

O mais versátil jogo da MesaBoardgames até à data, numa produção surpreendente, sem perder a identidade do produto português, que encaixa no familiar, mas também pisca o olho aos aficionados, sem desiludir quer um, quer outro género! Se há muito suspeitava que os jogos de Gil D'Orey podiam ir além do "andas 1, 2 ou 3, apanhas aqui - entregas ali", 1942 mostra que há Gil depois de Panamax, num modular area control\deck builder, com características de area enclosure e uma enorme pitada de bluff!

I really like this game because it has a lot of moving parts for something so simple mechanically, however it relies really heavily on luck and a real "gotcha" mentality that can seem fairly mean spirited and possibly be off-putting to some players. It's easy to see how someone could be very frustrated by being the victim of setbacks caused by other players multiple times, especially when it leads to someone being unable to obtain new spies for consecutive rounds. That said, as someone who enjoys a good "gotcha" style game every now and again, this is one of the most unique and enjoyable I've played.

Worked very well with three players. High replayability factor due to the random modular board. Cool artwork, nice spy names (some real existing persons). All in all a solid area control set collection hybrid with a pleasantly short duration.

I really enjoy this game. I am very engaged by the intrigue of trying to outmaneuver players to win the spies. I love the way the theme is captured. The game has a wonderful historical theme, and I feel like I am building my team of spies. It is like the scenes from the Mission: Impossible movies where they are going of dossier of operatives to assemble their perfect team. This game offers fantastic choices and a perfect mixture of strategy and tactics. Each turn players have to evaluate what the best move is, but they have to also keep the end game in mind at all times.

RATING: 8.2
Clever guessing game with enough flavor to make it feel like a film noir spy movie set in WW2. You have to be thinking on multiple levels as you place your spies. City location matters, placement within a location matters, and which spy you use matters a lot. The guessing game nature of the game, combined with a little die rolling, make this a game that pure Euro types might not like. Sometimes you will be defeated by the stupid decisions of your enemies. If that bugs you, this isn't your game.

The interaction of spy and location traits can be very cool. Got a kick out of luring my opponent's assassin to a location where I could push her off a cliff; a classic noir moment. 

A downcheck for some people is that it's a bit fiddly. Not in pieces, there are really just spies and the board, but each spy can have special abilities, each board can have special characteristics, and each space can often give you the ability to look at hidden cards. This makes for lots of things that are easy to forget. Multiple game plays should solve this. I'd think by your third game play everything could start to become automatic, leaving your brain free for guessing. 

Not a game for AP types who might overthink their moves.

After one play of this game, Im not really sure if I want to keep it around... I think I expected it to be lighter than it was, but it ended up being so thinking and I really wasn't sure what I was doing the whole game, rather than it clicking half way through... I may try for one more play before putting it in the trade pile though.

[url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/230229/item/5643155#item5643155]1 play, 3er[/url]

The game is clever but maybe a little too chaotic for me to play very often. It's sort of like having multiple simultaneous auctions, with your bidding constrained by some geographical/spatial elements (the paths you must build in order to place your spies at the inner locations), plus special powers, plus set collection. To do well, you need to get in other people's heads and figure out what they might be going for, how they might "bid", etc. I'm generally no good at that sort of thing. Still, it's a pretty fun time (and I won!).

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each round, you construct a random configuration of tiles representing different locations. Each tile has a unique rule modification and gets a random spy card placed on it. Players start with a hand of spy cards, each with a different strength number. Each round, they'll place spies one at a time onto the tiles (creating a path of your spies, from outer edge inward). Some go face up, others go face down. After everyone has placed all their spies, resolve location tiles in numerical order: flip all spy tiles on the tile face up and then resolve the spies in order based on their spaces on the tile. Spies have a variety of powers (e.g., kill other spies, summon spies to the current tile, gain strength based on neighboring tiles, protect a spy from assassination). The player with the most strength on the tile claims the spy there. After all locations have been resolved, players discard down to the hand limit and place the discards into their personal display. 

At the end of the game (4 rounds?), score VP based on:
- public VP cards drawn at the start of the game, rewarding having specific combinations of spies in HAND
- sets of spies in personal displays
Most VP wins!

Under 1h playtime, but it feels fresh every time, thanks to the variable board and up-for-grabs spies that pop up every turn (4 total)
Very tactical, you need to try and cover as many possibilities as you can, specially with 4 players, since when it is your turn to play again everything can change

RATING: 9.5
We really enjoy playing this game.  On our first few games we accidentally overlooked some features and abilities, but we're now aware of the many possibilities.  And yes, one can come from behind by using a little forethought.  For instance, I sacrificed some heavy hitters in one round in order to acquire an Assassin  with the ability of two kills to be used on the next turn.  My rating might change in the future ... most likely it'll go up.  And if there's ever an expansion, we'll get it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
These ratings are for a TWO PLAYER game (I have not tried higher player counts).

Ratings (1 to 5):

Simplicity: 5
--> Simple, straightforward mechanisms and easy to remember rules.  After 15 minutes absorbing the rules, you probably will rarely consult the rulebook again, even after a long layoff.

Depth: 4  (5 if using Double Agent Expansion)
--> Excellent depth as you are constantly analyzing what your opponent is doing, how you can react to his move and how he can react to yours.  Some moves may seem “obvious”, but often they are ways for your opponent to thwart your plans by using powers from multiple spies together.  To play best, one should strive to think at least 2-3 moves ahead.  The use of small amounts of bluffing (with cards that you know will remain hidden) also positively increases the complexity.  

Player Interactivity: 5 
--> Nearly everything you do matters to your opponent and effects him, and vice versa.  Extremely interactive as you constantly react to and anticipate your opponent's moves.

Theme: 3
--> The artwork and actions that are somewhat specific to spies (assassination, seduction, diplomacy, etc.) give some thematic feeling (the Double Agent expansion also helps), but at its core it is a game of numbers and special ability symbols so it might be considered slightly dry to some that choose not to use their imagination a little.

Fast-Moving: 5  (4 if using Double Agent expansion)
--> Some AP is to be expected for newcomers, so that can slow things down in the first few games, but as you gain experience with certain spy combinations and strategies the turns move faster.  Compared to most other games I play, moves go relatively quickly.

Replayability: 4
--> This game can have a somewhat predictable runaway leader issue, but I feel this is mostly resolved with my Reserve variant (see Forum->Variant section).  Also, to enhance replayability, I'd recommended getting the Double Agent expansion (mainly for the two more boards, but the double agent cards also add variety) and the five card promo expansion (currently available at the BGG Geek Store).

This is a solid, enjoyable, and HIGHLY underrated game IMO.

Really good game. Lots of fun with the "spy fights", and trying to find out which cards our opponents have played! The points system is not the best, and the fact that you have to change map tiles every round makes it a little bit boring.

I'd like to get this out a few more times because I do like the idea of the game.  But so far it has had a luke warm reception from players.

It might be the kind of light game that is a little too hard to fully grasp at first glance.  The you're way behind before the game gets rolling and by the time it's over you are ready to write it off.

That said it's got some creative ideas and I'd like to see it with some more experienced players before passing final judgements.

If you have a good round and win a few spies, you're faced with the often excruciating decision of who to retire. Those spies are no longer going to help you recruit others or count towards the end goals. Because of that deciding who to keep can be a difficult exercise, which is part of what makes this game so much fun! The theme and real places add to experience.  I like the thick tiles instead of cards.

In a 4p game, you get at most 12 actions. And it's entirely possible that several of those won't matter (either assassinated or just ending up being meaningless). It's a game where there are so many pieces of hidden information that you have very little strategy on which to base your decisions.

International spies card game on a modular tiles city board. The spy cards are more like tile-cards. It has a deck builder quality as you recruit and convert enemy agents to your deck (or stack) each having unique abilities. But you must discard down to six thereby forcing some starter spies into early retirement. Each spy card has different characteristics like nationality, gender, and speciality. You must decide which spies to keep based on your scoring objectives and based on the fluid dynamic of the enemy spies. Spy initiative is determined by the city tiles and further divided by the sectors on each tile. A critical part of the game is observing and anticipating turn order where your plans are lost and won.

This was clearly the surprise of GenCon 2016 for me. I'll admit I had a friend pick it up more on recommendation from reviewers I trust. I think a couple of video reviews in particular pushed me over the edge to give it a try. To me this is game is even more than what it appears at first. For such relatively simple rules there is so much to think about. It seems that the 4 player game is much more chaotic than the two player. I'm not sure what player count will be the sweet spot for the game. It certainly is "thinky" but in short enough amount of time that it is acceptable.

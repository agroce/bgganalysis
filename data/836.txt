A good, low-complexity train game. Pity about the drab production from Eagle. Does suffer from runaway leader issues.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating (one play).  A precursor to Age of Steam, and you can see how AoS evolved with more luck being taken out of the game as it developed.

The rolling dice to reduce share price can really throw people who are not used to it.

Debt management is important and can be very unforgiving.  In our game the people who operated with the least debt were the leaders.

This is in fact a study for age of steam. I've played Australian Railways some years ago and this is the same game. I can't say it is bad, but because Wallace made age of steam later, this game had no reason to be republished in 2011.

Initial rating:

We played incorrectly (3-player), only having one commodity card/turn instead of 2, due to a mis-read by me.  The game seemed more luck-based than is possibly true by playing correctly.  We called it about 3/4 of the way through.  Would like to play it again, but am somewhat concerned about randomness of both rail links and cubes appearances.

RATING: 3.5
The game has a very slow and random start.  The middle of the game feels better, but the late game drags with everyone over-analyzing cube movement.  From the rules it sounds interesting, but the randomness of the available loads and goods cubes results in a game of tactics and speculation.  Games with these elements can be fun but while playing N.E.R. (especially early in the game) one or more players might have little or nothing to do for several turns, which is incredibly boring.

Trimmed down AoS. I like this, but am finding that
these Winsome designs all sorta run together in a
way that the richer 'xx games do not (usually - things
like 18AL seem like knock-offs of '30).

Yeah, the gameplay's different between them, but the concept of 
abstracting train games this much is feeling a bit
too dry for me.

A very nice addition to the Early Railways system. Similar enough to Lancashire to be basically the same game. I'm looking forward to more games to suss out the optimal player counts for each and better understand the particular 'character' of each.

NER is the second game in a series that eventually morphed into Age of Steam. Many things are familiar here: issue shares, run railroads. But some things are mightily changed: links are bought via the auction, and money really matters. The single goods shipment unless you decline to buy a link (in which case you get 2) also changes the system up significantly.

The key to these titles seems to be buying the right link at the right time. Because of the limited control over what links come out, and how goods growth goes, players are often best served by simply trying to get a bunch of links that are in the middle of the action, so that other people will continually hand them 1 or 2 extra income.

In specific terms, NER is identical to Lancashire in its rules, the only difference is the physical layout of the map. The initial links setup is fairly similar to Lancashire in that the players who purchase the first turn contiguous links leading to Boston are in the driver's seat in terms of winning or losing, but awareness of that also tends to inflate the starting auction. I honestly see no notable difference between this and Lancashire in game terms, and I'm kerflummexed as to why this has a reputation as being the better of the two. For my money, Australian is the clear winner in the series because of its goods growth system, but that's just me I s'pose.

The bottom line is that these ER games are an interesting change of pace for AoS fans. The system is still similar enough to be recognizable, but it's different enough to require different strategies and approaches, which suits me fine. You definitely have to like auctions and nickel and dime style money appraisal to enjoy these games though, as the winning condition is money held at the end of the game, which makes them more calculational than AoS. I dig them in general though, and I enjoy all 3 games in the series, and am more than willing to pull them out a couple of times a year in place of AoS.

(Note: I play using several AoS components to ease play: player track markers, goods cubes, and coinage...this completely removes the need for the annoying cardboard chits and the paper money, and I believe it increases my enjoyment of the game)

New England Railways is an entry in the Early Railways Series, the games that eventually led to Age of Steam (and Steam, and Railways of the World). Rules are virtually identical to Lancashire Railways so all my comments from that game apply here as well (including the note about loans in a hole and my first play setting a nice example...).

While Age of Steam is one of my favourite games, and I believe the Early Railways games get an interest bonus due to that lineage alone, I'm not too keen on the very restricted route-building system used here. Route card draws and goods growth can screw you over quite badly, and the game is a rather long one to sit out in case that happens.

I will also note that the Eagle Games reprint is a gruesome example of a Photoshop experiment gone horribly wrong. I'm usually not a Winsome purist but in this case I vastly prefer the original materials.

RATING: 8
Fairly interesting pick-up-and-deliver game sullied by whims of the dice and card flips. Any further plays of this will find me altering the game to remove the random effects.

Update: Incorporating the contiguous organic track growth from Australian Railways makes this a better game. Next time, we'll try the good's growth as well. For now, not as good as AR, but still good.

This Age of Steam predecessor is a decent enough game, but it suffers from one overriding problem: it isn't half the game Age of Steam is.

Note that this is basically the same game as Lancashire Railways.

As noted, part of the Age of Steam family. Much more of an auction game than a cube mover. I personally do not like it as much as Steam or Railroad Tycoon because of the emphasis on the auction but certainly to each his own. Not a bad game but one that no longer hits the table at all.

RATING: 5
Earlier rough draft of what would evolve into Age of Steam. Here you take loans to build track to deliver goods to get income to build track. Every link is auctioned off from randomly drawn cards. This puts too much of your growth pattern out of your control. You might start in a certain area, but then connecting cards may not come up until late, essentially knocking you out of the game. Links are worth from 5-10 cash at the end of the game, which is where the bulk of your end game money lies, making this much more about building than delivering.  The cube distro is lopsided as well. If you don't have a connection to Boston or Providence, forget about it! 

Not a terrible game, but any number of later generation games are better. This one is strictly for the game historians!

RATING: 8
The only difference to its predecessor Lancashire Railways is a different map and the availability of a reprint by Eagle Games who managed to equip the reprint with a graphical design much uglier than the Winsome original. Queen at least improves on the quality of the graphics and the material while not necessarily on the functionality. As to the game itself, it's a fun diversion from Age of Steam.

If Wallace went back to this design and worked out some of its problems (for example the game starts too slowly with players having pretty much nothing to do until things get going) he'd have a hit in his hands. Even in this shape New England Railways is a nice train game.

Interesting train game that obviously bears a close relationship to its more famous offspring -- Age of Steam.  The auctions for routes form the centerpiece of this game while Age of Steam has more interesting track laying and role-taking portions.  This is a clever game in its own right but I find that the system really shines in its later incarnation.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Comments refer to the "ready to play"/boxed version...probably the same as the "cut it out yourself" version.

Biggest complaint:  cluttered and confused board...too cramped with counters and link ownership markers.

Other than that this is a surprisingly GOOD game, and I would say a must play for any die hard age of steam fan! (myself included)  This is of course from the "early railway series" of train games which are clearly the predecessors to the Wallace hit "Age of Steam".  It is fun to play as an inkling to AoS, but also succeeds well on its own.

For myself, New England Railways at times contains much of the feel of AoS but with different (yet nearly as elegant) mechanics...for example: income reduction is handled with a neat yet effective roll of [Current Income divided by (2d6+1)] rather than reduction brackets as in AoS.  Feels and functions in NEARLY the same way as it does in AoS (slightly more random of course).  Or, NER use of random card pull to instigate commodities production vs. AoS's "place goods phase"/production action.

Some differences that exist are nice...i.e. being able to pay off debt.  This is crucial, as NER's debt mechanism can be quite menacing!

Very good.  Also, seems to play quite fast.

A very solid 6. (some deductions made for cluttered board and a slightly less elegant design that AoS...hey, its hard to NOT compare the two)

If you can find this try it!

Very nice! Has a lot in common with Age of Steam, but there are several major differences. You can actually pay off your debts! I like this game, and will definitely play it every now and then instead of AoS.

RATING: 7
First impression (5 players): I like the debt-based economy of NER. It's nasty in a just the right way. 

The game overall is a mix between Volldampf and Age of Steam. It doesn't have action cards like Volldampf but has quite many other strong random elements. Your route can be delayed by one turn if your roll of die fails, the goods are randomly drawn and as the biggest the routes come to game in a random order. I kind of like the last part as this forces you to use other players routes too. Something you hardly ever see in Age of Steam. It's harder to get nicely connecting routes of just your own track. 

Mechanics of the game don't work too well with 5 players. There are too few turns and buying any route that doesn't 100% surely connect in this round or one after that is a bit too big gamble. The game definitely works better with less players and might be at its best with just three players. My rating for 5 players would be 6 but as I can see (and guys told me too) that game is clearly better with 3 players, I'm giving it a 7.

*New England, Lancashire and Australian Railways, Pampas Railroads, American Rails and Texas Pacific all stored in my custom Early Railways box*

N.E. plays a lot like Lancashire and has maybe a more forgiving board.  But the board is so hard to read in this one and there was confusion regarding shipping on certain links due to board design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Base on one play: Each turn there are four new cubes added to the board based on a draw deck and two connections put up for sale also based on a draw deck. You purchase connections and then move cubes to get income. The goal is to have the most money at the end of the game. The auction of track was a big decider and the order in which cubes get drawn and which links come for auction can really be frustrating to some and great to others. An ok train game, but there are much better.

Excellent pick-up-and-deliver train game. It is in the same family tree as Age of Steam, but better actually, because the game is steamlined and simpler in structure. Still a good head workout, but without the hassle. Don't be fooled by the simple looking map. The game consists of a usurious bank, a cut throat auction, an an intensely competitive pick-up-and-deliver mechanic.

This is worth contacting Winsome and getting on Bohrer's re-print list. At least you'll get it sooner than a Deep Thought 18XX game.

It's an OK game at best, with badly written rules in places and the worst board and cards that I've ever seen in a game that got past playtest stage.  The production values and choices are just appalling, and actually distract from gameplay.

Age of Steam developed the concept of this game far better, and avoided the painful flaws.

An excellent railway game. Bidding on the links as they come available, allows for the players to jockey for position to force some scoring in opponents rounds. Actually prefer it to Age of Steam. Prefer Lancaster Rails opening which seems to be a bit more balanced.

It sounds snarky, but this is a B-level train game. Clearly a relative of Age of Steam, but not nearly as deep. You're fighting against a few fronts of randomness in this one, which is not in and of itself a reason to dismiss it. But even with the market reduction die roll (which is designed to hurt the highest-income player disproportionately more than the rest of the players), it is very hard to catch a leader once someone starts to pull away. Your only real player-controlled weapon is to bid up the tastier links, but if the leader's income is higher than yours, you need to take out loans to get the money to do that, and a debt spiral is a very real possibility in this game. I've played games of this where the final scores are 60 to 50 to -85.

MS Paint gradients, completely unreadable "black text on dark blue" cards, blank card backs, cheesy clip art on the map.  This game has it all. Kudos to Eagle for hiring the handicapped.  I can only assume the graphic designer and everyone who approved his work are all blind.  The game itself is good enough to muscle through all these problems and delivers amazing game play
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is part of a system that eventually spawned the masterpiece that is Age of Steam. In a way, it is simpler and focuses more on positioning yourself in such a way that others make use of your links. More links isn't always better and it's easy to get sucked into a debt spiral. There is a bit of luck in the cards and the dice used for market changes (income reduction). I'm also not very fond of the play continues in clockwise order from player with highest income.

Certainly you can see the early beginnings of Age of Steam here -- route building, cube delivery, loans/interest -- but the random order in which routes come up for auction is kind of annoying, as is the fact that at least one player goes without a route every turn. The latter is not such a problem since you get an extra delivery ... except for the first turn. Not bad for a change once in a while, I suppose, but I'd much rather play something else.

Meh. It shares a lot of mechanisms with Age of Steam and Steam, but with more luck and less strategical freedom. That would be OK if the game were fairly short, say an hour or so. But you can play AoS or Steam in the same time, with much more gaming oomph. I see no reason to play this instead.

Like AoS except: 1. all possible routes between cities are defined and to be claimed, rather than hammered out with all the AoS track tiles (I do prefer to avoid them). 2. The routes come out, mostly randomly, for auction, and you can only buy one per turn. 3. Goods production is totally random and feels pretty stingy.

My first game ended with only a single player in the black (net worth). Seriously overestimated how many goods would be appearing on the board to be shipped. But because the game is so stingy with goods cubes it feels kind of random who gets an opportunity to transport something and who doesn't.

It's clear that the best rail networks will end up with the most income, but it was quite clear that it wasn't worth going into massive debt to construct such a network.

I want to play again with the "organic growth" system of Australian Railways.

...Ok, I tried that. It's not all that different I don't think.

Overall I don't really like how tracks come out for auction randomly, vs. in AoS where you just build whatever is most important to you. It feels tedious to try to come up with bids for track that really may not be worth anything.

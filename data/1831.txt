I really enjoyed the building my railroads with crayons. Was good fun. Not sure if it will hit the table ever again.

This expands the Empire Builder map to include Canada and Mexico.  The number of mileposts between U.S. cities are fewer than in EB.  I prefer playing EB but I am more than willing to play this version if someone has a strong desire to pull this out.  I own the tube version.

Probably my favroite of the crayon rail games. Not sure why Mayfair has this AND Empire Builder, since both take place in North America. I think this one adds more of Canada and Mexico to the map.

Good game.  I enjoy the crayon rails when played with the public locking variant.

I like the addition of Mexico.  One can start there and do just fine. Helps to balance the east/west problem of Empire Builder.  Some nice loads in Mexico.

Needs a better distribution of contracts.  Otherwise fine.

I really liked this game in my pre-BGG days, but sweet Jaysus did it ever lead to some long games. Picture this: it's 8 p.m., and my family has just finished eating dinner:"Hey guys, let's play Railroads". "Oh yeah, fun. I'll go grab it". 

...(Eight hours elapse)...

"Fucking hell, is that the Sun? Is the Sun coming up?"

It is not a bad game, but I will never play it again with slow-ass players.

Comment from Iron Dragon:

I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!

Love this game, but the system is like a solitare game you play as others play.  Who manages the load cards best wins.

Mayfair Games.  Good, fun involved railroad game. This can be characterized as a heavy euro style game.  Players must plan carefully and execute building out their line to deliver goods.

Extremely enjoyable, if dry, logistics game.  The non-competitive elements make it a pleasure for my wife..plays long with more than four. (see Empire Builder for rating)

The best of all the Mayfair crayon RR games. I have played many, many times and I love this one.

This represents the old "North America with Mexico" map, which allows you to pick up Sugar in Culiacan.  The newer "Empire Builder with Mexico" game has a very similar map, but Sugar is only available in San Francisco.

All of my crayon rail games are gone now - victims of my complete lack of interest in drawing lines on a map for 3  hours and yet be totally subject to the roll of the dice & the turn of a friendly card.

One of the best railroad games ever created.  The simple business model in the game does not detract from the rail-building emphasis.  A great game for any railfan.

This is a lot like Empire Builder, but a little more difficult...  Only played Empire Builder with Canada and Mexico, but this was a little harder than that because of the different loads...

Don't bother with this game; play Empire Builder instead.  Adding Mexico and Canada does little to improve the game.  Also, the roll up map is very awkward while playing.  It is not nearly as convenient as the Empire Builder and Eurorails boards.

Very long, especially with a full boat. The longest of the crayon train games in my experience.

I much prefer this over [GameID=168], but play the latter when I need a quicker game.

Seattle wants coffee, sweet!  I do think the crayon games are fun, but I am not a big fan of the tube or the length of time these games take.

Love it.  Nicely done.  Great game for more than 2 players.  It's also the last of the train games that I own (I used to have 5 of them).

I like this one almost as much as British Rails. 

Order of ranking for me: Euro, British, North American, Iron Dragon, Martian, Russian, China, Australian,  Nippon, India, and Lunar.

RATING: 7
Text on map is a bit indistinct but the rest of the game is a winner. The payoffs are smaller than with the other 'crayon' rail games but the terrain is overall easier to navigate. I like the laminated maps of this game and Australian Rails better than the mounted maps of EuroRails, India Rails, and Iron Dragon; washable markers work better and the maps are probably going to last longer without the staining and edge damage where the 'puzzle' pieces fit together.

Empire Builder with Mexico (1st edition).  Adds Mexico to standard Empire Builder.

Pretty much a standard variant. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Ahh, the fabled transition from old style Empire Builder (without Mexico) to new style Empire Builder (with Mexico).  Given that I do not particularly like the addition of Mexico to the original game, it probably comes as no surprise that I am not particularly enamored with this edition.  As a transitional game, it doesn't really offer anything, unless, like me, you do not own the newer editions of Empire Builder.  The biggest problem I have is that the original map of EB is still my favorite of the series.  When I want to play in North America, it is really hard to give that up.  Still, with the redrawn map, there are some interesting changes to routes.  This combined with a seemingly different payout schedule make the game an interesting change of pace every now and again -- like once a year.  [08/10/2007]

I was a little disappointed to see this superseded by a new edition of Empire Builder in the Mayfair line, rather confusing the name issues.  But NARails is a good game in its own right.

Lots of fun creating your own rail network with crayon, combined with efficient running of the contracts. Amongst experienced players, the outcome is ultimately driven by the draw of the cards though.

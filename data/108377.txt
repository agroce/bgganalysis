Nice card game. A lot of different modules to build your space station and a lot of event cards.

RATING: 8
Clever meatier filler. Plays quickly for a game with some depth. Driven by lucky card draws to a large extent since you will play every card you can (since to redraw to 5). But this is mitigated somewhat by the "draw 10 keep 5" start up. There is also some strategy in selecting which modules to build/repair when your money gets low.

Good game, satisfied with rules which are easy and clear. Playing two weeks amd still thinking about strategies for next game. Is not too much based on the lucky. Kgb vs Cia is more based on the lucky. We are three for playing games await when we meet to try in the three.

I'm the game designer for Space Station, so I'm biased. Always want to play it = 9.

Space Station is easy to learn, nice to look at and provides variety as well as a lot of tactical and strategical thinking. Even more so with the new Core Module promos.

When is the best timing to play this card? What can I do to be able to afford another module? Should I go for long-term economy or grab that victory point? Should I go for this color even though I'm 2 modules behind? Should I spend money to repair that temporary damage? What needs to be done ASAP and what can wait a bit? Do I need more crew or more modules where they can work? Should I keep this card for the next year?...

Lots of fun interaction and chatting during the games. Since Space Station is around 60 minutes, there is almost always time for it and sometimes for several runs.

RATING: 7
The game was rather expensive, but I invested the money anyway because I liked the idea of building my own space station and it plays fairly well. 
I am rather frustrated that the second edition this year was less than half of what I paid while the components and box became better. :-(

expected a light filler, but got a real nice game that really works with two players. enough randomness to keep it interesting, enough possibilities to control what you are doing.

I had my doubts about this game when I read the rules (it just didn't seem very fun then), but I was surprised over how fun it was when you actually played the game :)

RATING: 4
Too much randomness, and distasteful "drag the leader to everyone else's level" gameplay. Would probably be better if you removed half the event cards.

Space Station is a beautiful game with simple rules. Each round of play is unique and there is always a way to catch up to the other players. The card effects are balanced, but still powerful. It is challenging, which is why I keep playing it, even if I usually lose...

Great little Game. The design of the cards is functional but a litte bland compared to the much better known space station game Among the Stars but that's fine by me. The counters are a shame though. I use crew from Galaxy Trucker, Credits from Netrunner for VPs and temp. Damage and Damage Counters from X-Wing. Works awesome and looks great

This is essentially a prequel to Terraforming Mars. Clearly the designer was more raw in 2011. The event cards are probably a little too powerful (as they're free to play) and mean for some. But it's a satisfying engine builder and you get to layout a pretty Space Station each :)

RATING: 7.6
A clever card game of building up your space-station, where the cards played give you various benefits, but money to place cards is extremely hard to come by.  And being attacked or attacking other players' space stations can be challenging!

Great fun game.

I've only played the game a few times, but some things are obvious: 

1. It's always bad to have a good start when it comes to scoring as it's a very aggressive game where the leader will be stabbed by all. If you instead build a lot without scoring much and don't attack others you will have more momentum at the end of the game, and that's when you win. 

2. Lot's of randomness mostly due to very powerful and evil event cards. 

This is a game which I'm always quite reluctant to play, for some unknown reason, but I always have fun playing. 

The best quality of the game is the intrigue, backstabbing and whining which is kept on a decent level by the game: you cannot take it personal when everyone is backstabbing everyone. The best whiner is often the winner. 

One card should be banned from the deck: the one that shifts all available workers to the player next to you, it's too random and powerful. 

There are also some concerns with "bookkeeping": when the designer himself still needs to read the steps in the clenaup phase every time to get it right you know it's tricky. Also some modules that yilds a bonus in the cleanup phase if you had placed a worker there and the bonus is payed after removing workers: easy to miss the bonus. (The designer have since explained to me the reason he did this was for educational reasons, but it's still a lot to keep track of)

One good thing with the game is that it's between filler and full game in length, so perfect for ending the evening. Very quick setup (and putting back in the box). Six players with rules explanation in less than 90 mins. It's also more or less proportional to the number of players in time consumption and every game takes about the same time.

Purchased for solo play as there seems to be two solo variants "Bot" & "Peace". Both seem to be fun and I will probably try to get it to the table for multi-player games too.
My rating of 8 is based only on solo play which is Great!

RATING: 3
Very light, take that style game of hand management, with the theme of building a space station that is diverse and better to handle elements than your neighbors.

It's okay, but I really don't see much here to make this worth playing over a million other games in this same time and thought space.

RATING: 6
A rather clever little game. Build a space station and balance money vs. VP's. There is also some interaction between players. The rating might very well go up once we play this with more players.

(after 1 3p game)   Being a pioneer, playing Essen releases can be a double edged sword.  I like the idea of building a space station and with more familiarity with the cards this one should improve.

Player space station building (heh! city/borough/village/space station).
Card drawing.
Money management.
Worker placement (I know right? How awesome is that?)
Light-medium weight.
Medium player interaction.
Medium theme application.
[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/theme_sci-fi/user/Vroenis]Sci-fi theme[/url].

Played over six years (rounds), this ends up being crunchier than it initially feels, as money is the only consumable and quite difficult to get. I did change [i]resource management[/i] to [i]money management[/i] and added [i]worker placement[/i] because you do actually use them as workers in your space station, and once an action is taken it can't be taken again.

You'll draw module cards, pay to add them to your station, allocate workers to carry out actions and play events. VP scoring is pretty cool with majority colours giving points so everyone can potentially score from different types of modules to keep it tight.

I really do love small games, and it's nice to have another sci-fi theme. Often the flavour text on a card is quite funny too!

Classic Knizia auction game, that also involves set collection, where your points are your money, and you use them wisely to generate more points.

Each round, you auction tiles of goods that are to be acquired and put onto boats, which are space-limited.  The set you auction is up to that player's discretion, and this is where alot of the strategy is, in the set offerings.  The highest bid takes the set, and all players continue until everyone has five total tiles.  The highest tile total(s) score points.  Then the goods are loaded onto the ships- the highest(s) in each ship also score points, then you can also score extra points for moving exceptionally high within a boat.  3 rounds and the game is over.

I've heard that this game is only good for 6 (which makes it valuable for that sake alone, not many good 6-player games), but definitely enjoyed my 4-player games of this, so I think it probably scales well, plus it's relatively short and easy to learn/play.

Medici just doesn't do it for me. I find auctions interesting, but as a part of a game rather than a whole. Medici is all auction. I found it very dry, think the downtime players can experience is pretty bad, and just don't feel any tension. The amazing thing is, some I know say that they find this game to be one of the most intense games they play! Clearly, I just don't like straight auction games. I need to give this one a few more trys before I give up on it, but the initial play was not enjoyable for me.

2 plays / 4 players

LIKE: Such an excellent design. I really enjoy the subtle constraints with the boat size, the 10 gold card, the goods track, and deciding how many cards come out. The once-around auction works very well here.

DISLIKE: Difficult for beginners to know the value of cards and when to bid to block someone. Dry theme-- I think it could have been a pet store theme to attract a more diverse audience. Points can be somewhat predicted after a few plays, but the random cards work to diffuse this.

OVERALL: Solid game, plays quickly, easy to explain. Lighter than Ra, but more accessible. 

Comparable to Stockpile.

One of the classic bidding games, I have the updated illustrated version which is lovely. The rules are so simple, the entire game truly hinges on your ability to maneuver your opponents into poor bids or slink in to gain a set of cards for a low price - or even free if played right. I love that it extends from 2 to 6 players as well. However, it is a fairly sterile experience unless you really enjoy a pure bidding conflict.

RATING: 9
A gem of a game that I'm just starting to get to know.  The most recent version of the game by Rio Grande has decent artwork and the box looks quite opulent.  I know some of the previous incarnations have been dreadful, but this one is fine.  The board could do with being 10% bigger though as the ppieces don't go on very well - or as a friend of mine said - pegs and a hole board would be a good way of scoring the markets.

The game itself could be viewed (if you were so inclined) as rather mathematical, yet I didn't find myself attempting to calculate every single nuance as I might have done in Modern Art.  I think that the maths is obscured by the fact that you're hardly ever sure what is left in the bag or how your position within the various scoring components is going to come out each round. Thus the overall feeling is of a rough calculation rather than a precise one...and this is greatly to the game's benefit.  So, it's a much simpler game than Modern Art, yet loses nothing for it.  It's also really elegant, plays in 40-50 mins and is a lot of fun. I didn't find it dry at all.  I think it will get a lot of play when there is 50-60 mins left in a session.

We always have loads of repartee and joking playing the game.  This is aided by calling the skins "hedgehogs," the spices "ganja" (you can imagine the crop of comments there) and the cloth "flying carpets."

Auction + Set Collection = Fun!  (At least in this case.)

A rather fun game where cards are purchased with VPs via an auction mechanism.  There are 3 rounds with scoring at the end of each round based on the total value of the cards (the numbers, 0-5 and 1x 10) and leaders and/or higher placements in sets of the cards (the 5 colors).

The theme is pretty thin, at least in the version with cards, but don't let that deter you.  This is a fun auction game that provides many interesting choices – valuation of the cards, whether to bid or pass, how many cards to auction when you lead, which cards to collect, denying others certain cards, and so on.

Now I'm not a huge fan of auction games in general, but I gave Medici an 8 because if I'm going to play an auction game it might as well be a good one like this.

Medieval Merchants buy produce at an auction. Produce has varying values and points are scored for the highest value full boats(5 produce). Points are also scored for having bought the highest number of each individual produce. Simple game but a lot of thought needed to decide the best purchases. Good game.

RATING: 5
The problems in this game is that its very difficult to determine the value of things, especially for new players, and you can bid in very small increments.  Should you bid 4, or 5, or 6?  Who knows? 

Additionally, the auction is once around, so you have to guess what other people will bid, you cant just arrive at a price by determining who wants it more, and having them pay the price just above the other's max pain.

Other auction games are much better, like Ra and Traumfabrik.

Bidding, bidding and only bidding.  If you don't like that mechanic, stay away.  A three round auction game.  It can easily be taught in 5 minutes or so.

Going for the best boat seems to be a pretty strong strategy.

If you like this mechanic this may be one of the best 6 player games out there.  Adding more players does not significantly slow down the game.  This is one of our standard "Go To" games for 6 players.  Plays great with 6.

For whatever reason I seem to do quite well at this, either winning or coming in second. The others I play with seem to question my buying decisions more than that of the others though.
It's not a game I would have expected to enjoy, mainly because it's largely auctioning, but I'll gladly play when given the chance.

2011-10 After a couple of years, and hearing an All About show from Board Games to Go, I no longer do so well. I may be paying too much, not buying the right lots, or just missing something that I intuitively got early on. But I've failed to compete in any recent game.

RATING: 7
A simple, streamlined, and intuitive auction game that holds up decades later. In this game, players are bidding on "lots" of goods with 2 end-of-round scoring mechanisms in mind. The first end-of round scoring simply rewards players with the most valuable cargo, irregardless of the goods. The second end-of-round scoring rewards players who have accumulated more goods, of a certain type, than their opponents. And because the second end-of-round scoring carries into future rounds, players quickly become invested in certain goods. Thus, the valuation of a lot is variable depending on the players and where they are in turn-order. Furthermore, the game has a spatial element (boats can only carry so many goods) and gives the auctioneer control over how large the lots area, which adds another interesting dimension to the game. 

Medici is often compared to Ra, another auction game by Knizia. And while Ra is often seen as more of a gamer's game because of the numerous ways to score... I actually prefer the simpler Medici because its less chaotic. For instance, both games have variable round lengths... but that is dictated by player decisions in Medici whereas its dictated by randomly drawing certain tiles in Ra. And as you can imagine, knowing the length of a round can have a profound effect on the valuation during the game.

Furthermore, Medici is known for some horrible editions. Somehow, this game has been printed by numerous publishers and they've largely have done a poor job with the production quality. And while the Latest edition by Grail Games is one of the best editions, it still falls short for being ideal; most notably, the money/vp track is difficult to read and the colorization of the goods/player-pieces isn't as distinctive as it should be. Who knows, maybe one day this game will be printed to a high standard. 

My only strong criticism of the game comes with lower player counts. With less players, cards are randomly removed from the game. And with some player counts (2/3-players) you may face a situation where 1/2 the cards aren't in play. Thing is, the known-distribution really adds richness to the decisions and having so many cards randomly removed adds a huge luck factor. So if you do play with less players, use one of the variants that keeps the distribution relatively-known.

Fairly intuitive which is somewhat rare for auction games. Better with more players. Some interesting tactics develop based on how the boats get filled. 

In any case, buy the German or French edition (for now, new RG edition might finally be nice) if you have the option. Otherwise, place cards up for bid in front of each commodity pyramid to make things easier during gameplay.

Egy jól sikerült licitálós játéknak tartom (5 áruféleségért folyik a licit), ahol szokás szerint több szempont alapján kapjuk a pontokat a végelszámolásnál. Játék közben még az is felmerült bennem, hogy jobb, mint a Ra, de összességében kevésbé kidolgozott és összetett.
Ha valaki az elején nagy hátrányba kerül, esélytelen végig, mivel kevesebb pénze lesz a következő körök licitjeire (pénz = pontszám). Hibaként rótták fel az asztalnál, hogy aki hamar bevásárol áruból, az tétlenül üldögél, és amíg a többiek feltöltik a hajóikat, addig ők nem vesznek részt a játékban. Elég látványosan unatkoztak néhányan:))) Ezzel együtt én élveztem (többnyire csak a végén töltöttem fel a hajómat, így nem maradtam ki a licitekből). A győztes stratégia ebben a partiban elég egyszerű volt: 2 termékből a lehető legtöbbet megszerezni, a másik 3 termékből semmit...

Medici is one of the purest auction games form the auctions wizard: the doctor Reiner Knizia.

It has a very simple rule set, and the result of the game depends only on the (strainghtforward but not simple at all) bidding decisions of the players.
The once a round bidding forces players to evaluate lots immediately, but each lot has different value to each player...

It is a filler, but a very thinky one. And it works with 6.

Tentative rating is a very respectable 7.5.

Two playings in and during the second, this game started to really show its stuff.  A very good pure bidding game where the items being bid on is determined by the players.  Scoring is done in two manners during three stages of the game.  A highly mathematical adventure that actually plays quite quickly.

Recommended for groups looking for a bidding game of five plus players.

Easy to teach, easy to learn, loads of depth.  Medici, in my opinion, is probably the best example of Euro-style board game design ever.  I will be playing this game for as long as I play games.

2005 French edition by "luimeme".  I really like the way this game plays, though I dont like the little ships trying to fit them on that odd scoring track and the chits are all pretty small, but other than that the game plays great.  Especially the mechanic of bidding with your victory points and then trying to ballance buying the 5 goods or having cards with the highest count was chanenging and fun.

RATING: 9
A game with Jekyll and Hyde exteriors for housing the same brilliant mind. Be careful which Medici you add to your own games gallery!

p: We first played this on a convention in the Amigo version, and would happily have played that game alone for the remainder of the day. A simple and elegant mechanic transformed into an utterly brilliant bidding game allowing for a wealth of interesting strategies, all viable. The element I enjoy most is letting people win a large amount of cards so you can force them out of the bidding of subsequent card sets by revealing one more than they have left room for.

One of the top 2 or 3 Knizia's and we were delighted when someone brought the US remake along to our weekly meet-up, so we could indulge once again, and to my surprise it became a very frustrating experience.

I seriously feel that this could well be the only game to deserve 2 entries, one for the original German Amigo one, and one for the Rio Grande version. How else to record that the likelihood of me playing this game again has an Atlantic 6 point rating gap between versions? Amigo 9, Rio Grande 3. It is the same game!
 
As I understood it, when Rio Grande licensed the game, they forgot to license the artwork. So they got a graphic designer to do that for them, who no doubt took one look at the theme and grabbed the pastels, feeling all DaVinci. And probably dreamt of matching the master when the boring coloured-bar pyramids disappeared in favour of superimposed artwork from the cards. Fantastic! Right up until the point you put dobbers on them and you realize that identifying areas are either cropped out or simply covered up. And suddenly it all becomes clear as mud. The first two pyramids alone might as well have had the same artwork, causing most of the confusion, but there seemed to be disorientation around the table whichever cards were revealed. Confusingly the cards have very distinctive coloured borders. Which correspond to absolute nothing on the board. Why?

Problem is, a clear overview of people's relative positions on the pyramids is vital to the game. If you can't take stock with a simple glance you add another layer of dilemmas that even the good Herr Knizia wouldn't welcome.

And like all warm relationships, once what was the main attraction becomes an irritant, everything gets dragged up, and suddenly the perfect match feels like one catastrophic mismatch. An anti-clockwise scoring track has to be dreamt up by a non-gamer. And I have seen players quite innocently skip the corner squares when moving their score-marker forwards (and backwards). Since only the odd numbers are visible, those beacon squares like 10,20,30,etc are ever so hard to zoom into. A few other points came up, and it was generally agreed that Rio Grande couldn't have made the presentation worse if they had tried it. Until someone pointed out that there was still the option to replace the playing pieces with round marbles.

Great graphic design usually is at its best when you are not aware of it, something that the German publishers quietly are very good at. One shot at the Rio Grande edition made me re-appreciate this often ignored skill.

Be sure to pick your right bedfellow if you want to have fun playing...

A heavy auction game. A little too mathematical for some but still a great game. The ability to value the auctions only comes with time, and games wont be won against good opponents until you start talking ball park. Medici has fallen a little in my esteem having discovered [GameID=118]. The difficulty with Medici is the black box that is the scoring system.

A straightforward, once-around auction where money is used for bidding, scoring and winning the game.  I like this a lot with 5 or 6 players and it's good with 4 too.

I've had a few experiences with this game recently where somebody gained a big advantage, fairly randomly, by filling up their boat for free at the end of a round.  At first, I lowered my rating for the game... after further review, I think it'd be fairly easy for experienced players to stop this from happening by bidding fewer tiles at once and throwing some out and not bidding too high for tiles.

I generally do like auction games and this one is solid. Like many of Knizia's games, there are many subtle strategies to watch out for when playing it.  (Not that I get any of them, but I know they are there to look for because the same players win most of the time. :))

I really like the new Rio Grande version, but they should have used cubes instead of the spice bags from [i][gameid=9216][/i] to mark the score and progress along each good. The bags are too big and are hard to see where they are on the board. I replaced mine with some plastic cubes from a teacher supply store.

Falls short of Modern Art and Ra in the Knizia auction trilogy.  The auctions aren't nearly as compelling and luck plays a much larger role.  Yet, what kills it is how much policing needs to go on among the players for any semblance of an interesting ang tight game to emerge.  I don't consider myself nearly as sensitive to such issues as many on BGG, but Medici almost builds it into the game.  I guess there is something to be said for placing a "perfect" bid that will send your opponent into paroxysms of agonizing analyzation, but too often it degrades into someone having to take it upon themselves to bid up a particular lot to make a player pay a "fair" price.  The difference between Ra and Medici is that while both make the items auctioned of different worth to each player, Ra provides more constraints on what is auctioned and the bidding.

A great set collecting Euro that teaches hard lessons about specialization and the "value" of sets that include bad stuff along with the good stuff.

Didn't get to play this game until recently and was surprised how fun it was being 22 years old. Bidding games are not my forte, but this one I like to play more.

It reminded me somewhat to Ra, another bidding game of Knizia, that I actually played a lot and I like Medici way better. The set collection is cleaner and the press-your-luck element isn't as prevalent as it is in Ra. Ra could get really swingy, this game has more of a gradual buildup.

What's also nice is that you can play a six player game in under an hour and still have a bit of a challenge. I would say this game works better with higher player counts, because of the distribution of resources.

I think this one deserves to be labeled as a classic by now. It's held its own.

An auction game with all of the wonderful crabs-in-a-bucket meta-play.  There are 3 rounds.  Each round there's cumulative 5 area majority scoring as well as single biggest value scoring.  The biggest value scoring is great er than any area majority but runs counter to focusing on a single (or two) areas.  Also, there are lovely opportunities to encourage others to fall on their swords.  

Brilliant play and made it into my permanent collection after a single play.

Juego puro de apuestas. Se apuesta por losetas, a una sola ronda, por lotes de una, dos o tres losetas de hasta cinco mercancías distintas, con el objeto de incorporar el lote en el barco de cada jugador. El barco tiene capacidad para cinco losetas. Una vez que se llena quedas fuera de las pujas.

Cuando todos los barcos estan llenos, se evalua primero el valor total de las mercancías (las losetas vienen con valores del 0 al 5) y se reparten 30,20,10 y 5 puntos según la posición.

Después en el tablero cada uno incrementa su nivel de cada mercancía (según el número de losetas) y también, en cada categoría se reparten puntos. En determinados niveles además se reciben puntos adicionales.

Es un juego sencillo de jugar y explicar.. aunque tiene pujas. Se le puede equiparar al Ra, aunque en éste se controla la duración del juego estupendamente.

Recomendable y accesible para no jugones.

This was to my mind a typical Knizia game, with what initially seemed like a simple and obvious gameplay revealing hidden depths of subtly and strategy.

The game is rated for being, 1) Easy to teach/play; 2) fun with even 6 players; 3) a tense auction game.

I love Ra with 3 players and Medici will probably become a favorite of mine in the 5-6 player range. Really simple rules, yet hard to play well, both trademarks of Knizia's genius. Luck of the draw might be a bigger factor here, but so far I find the fun-length ratio excellent. Design-wise, the Grail Games edition has some issues, but Vincent Dutrait's art is candy to my eyes.

Rating has moved up after 3 plays. An auction game with no theme but doesn't take away from the fun. Prefer a 6 player game where there is more control and strategy than with less players when random cards are removed.

Pure classic bidding goodness.  I used to think that open bidding would have been better, but it appears now that the once-around bidding works great, and adds another level of tension to the game.  Good ole Knizia!   

Update:  after several years of playing this game I've upped it to a 10.  It's simply one of the best bidding games in existence and one of my favorite games.

For what its worth, my copy is from the relatively recent Kickstarter. Additionally, my only play through of this game is with 3 players... I don't know how much of an effect this had on the game, but overall it was really liked by anyone in my game group. 

Not a whole lot to say about this one other then it was really uninteresting.

Satisfying for the amount of time it takes, great little auction game where you look for the best deals.  Worst board ever on the first Rio Grande edition.  It's seriously awful..

The new (2008) edition is pretty nice, I like the nice, larger, readable chits and the bag better than the deck of cards, and the circular scoring board for ranks is nice. I own the new edition as a part of my Reiner collection, but I'm still not wholly enamored of the game.

OK game, but it seems to lack the edge of Modern Art. It's more calculational and less psychological, so there is more "doing the math" on the value of the commodities and less other stuff. A good game, but definately less fun than Modern Art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another interesting auction game from the auction-master himself.  As in the Knizia auction games I've played (Ra, Modern Art) there are some interesting gives and takes to consider.  The items up for bid are worth different things to different players and one must keep that in mind when deciding what to bid for them.  The components in my version are butt-ugly and totally disfunctional, but if you can get past that it's a really good game.

Good auction game, quite well designed. 
I'm not fan enough of auction to have it last that long though. It feels a bit "cold"

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Medici finds itself - at least as far as I'm concerned - in an uncomfortable position among auction games. It does not offer the sheer fun and chaos of Kuhhandel, nor is it as strategic as Ra. Further, given it has no theme to speak of, it cannot compare to the wonderfully themed Traumfabrik (haven't yet played Modern Art, so can't compare it to that acclaimed title). 

I don't see what the repeat draw of Medici is compared to those three auction games. Dry themewise and calculational. Not bad, but there are simply better games out there these days.    

In short I consider Medici superceded by later Knizia designs. He - as the whole German boardgame scene - has come a long way since this release.

A brilliant straight-forward (meaning easy to grasp the rules of) multiple variable auction game.

However, like many rules light games with great depth, if you don't see the depth, you risk giving the game away to those who do as you play at the most obvious level (letting people get lots for cheap, letting someone fill up their boat for free in the first round, letting someone corner a market in the first round and max out in the second).

I feel the game works best at six players due to the pigeonhole principle forcing competition and the absolute knowledge of what is available .

This game is very much like Ra.  However, without the constraints to the bidding system like in Ra, the game seems to favor 4-5 players rather than the 3 player sweetspot of Ra.  This is more of a calculation game, and more approachable than Ra.  The tension though is derived from drawing luck in this game, not really on the bidding, whereas Ra is the opposite.  That is why I rank Ra higher.  Still a great game though, and I hope RGGs reprint uses the French (?) version, which is much more beautiful than the old English version.

The once-around auctions are very tense due to the varying worth of the lots to each player. Nothing better than sticking a player who was trying to bid you up with a lot they don't want. Assigning values to each lot is therefore a tricky business, and that makes for an awesome game. Knizia does it again. 

Like many Knizia games it can fail with risk-averse, unimaginative players.

Great Auction Game that really gave me the "Wow" factor.  I really enjoyed how you can drop people from auctions automatically by drawing more cards than they can hold.  I also enjoy the set collecting vs. point collecting ways in which you can go with each auction, especially because set collecting is done over all three rounds, but point collecting is this round only.  I would have to say I enjoy Modern Art more because this one feels like it has a little less luck management.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Have only played a few times but seems to have all the things I like:  simple rules, tension, interesting tactical situations, replayability, some psyching out, and a lot of numbers. So far it's ahead of Modern Art in the "8 rated Knizia games" category.  I feel more a sense of control in this game, less that I'm at the mercy of uncontrollable events.  Also, strangely, feels somewhat less repetitive to me, though it certainly is as well.  If only the graphics were easier to decipher.

RATING: 6
Still a little unsure about this one.  Hasn't made it off the shelf much at all.  I'm a bit leary of playing it in "mixed" company due to the number crunching required.

Dropped it to a 6.  DOn't like the way it boxes players into a "no good choices" situation.  Game invariably comes down to a couple of card flips, if you get good ones you win, you don't the player who played best does.

So Medici is a game I owned at one point, and traded away. Only to re-acquire after the appearance of the latest and much more attractive reprint of the game.

I kept seeing this game pop up on lists for "great games for work" or similar topics. I'm gaming with my coworkers with increasing regularity, and I loved the idea of a game that played well with six within an hour.

This went over surprisingly well... and my crew even requested an immediate 2nd play... pushing our lunch hour back a bit :) I think my original hesitation with the game was "wrong audience." I expect this to be a regular keeper in my office.

RATING: 7
Another relatively short and simple auction game; in this one, you bid your score for sets of items, and in each round, you stop bidding when you fill up your ship with five goods.  However, not only do the types of goods you buy matter (having the most of a type of good rakes in points), but the point values on the cards matter each round.  A few different strategies--or combinations of strategies--can be employed to collect points and try to win.

Update (after a lot of iPad play): Really not that interesting at all. Keep your head down, focus on your stuff. Try to make sure that no one is seriously competing for it. Otherwise, luck of the draw.

Original comment: This is a good quick auction game with a nice arc. As values become more asymmetric, the bids and load choices become nastier and more interesting. The three rounds are a perfect length for this mid-weight. In my game, I played the first round awfully, spreading myself way too thin. This perhaps colored my first impression since the true interest of the auctions and the lot size seem to only become interesting after the first round. But I still liked it reasonably well. I can say for sure that it beats Ra with an electrified whooping stick, though.

Very clean nearly pure auction game.  The random aspects of the card draws are minorly disappointing.  Rating may rise slightly on futher plays.

Update (2013): These days I tend to think of [thing=46][/thing] as an introductory game teaching basic conditional probabilities and player incentives.  It does what it does well, with no distractions or fuss, but ultimately presents an almost exclusively numerical puzzle -- a very contextual and elegant numerical puzzle -- rather than the more personally responsive systems I look for now.

(about 30 plays)... Excellent game! Feels like a classic. Highly recommended. Yes, go buy it! I enjoy it quite a bit. Seems quite different between numbers of players, since you remove cards with less than 6 people. A couple friends complained about the too-small components, the cubes that fit narrowly on the board's pyramid levels, and that the stylized little cards are hard to read across the gaming table. I think the common criticisms of the visuals are justified. Also, some of my gaming-newby friends, who learned the game at the same time as me, had trouble understanding how to play competitively, and liked the game less for that reason. I'm not lowering the score, however, since the rest of us loved it. I can't wait for the new version to come out (I pre-purchased). The new design (radial board, with tiles) looks promising. This game doesn't seem to mix well with tequila (madness), but I have played successfully at a beer pub.  Update: Speaking as a fan and advocate of Medici, the new board's radial design is easier to comprehend, a real achievement.  I might like the previous version's cards a little better; the tiles are OK though, they work.  The new commodity pictures are more recognizable, but not perfectly so.  And the previous scoring track is easier to manage than this one, but here you can stack the player tokens.  As scores separate, it isn't a big problem. I've also played on the French version and thought it quite beautiful but again, commodity board spaces are too small, and it suffers a little from no player mat ship cards, but the cards are superlative and clear. I have mixed feelings about the special power cards.

Great auction game. The auction format is similar to Ra, but different enough to be interesting. This is a much purer example of the genre, I think, since you have much more control over your bid, so your strategy is strictly about how much things are worth to you, not about how what suns you want to have next round. (Don't get me wrong, I love Ra. This just seems less...fiddly maybe? Less about turn order and tactics and more strategic, I think. That may hurt it though - it's more game theory and less game.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
There are so many competing forces at work in such a tight package with this game. Its easy to overlook the tremendous power at being the one who designates which lot(s) are up for auction. 

Having the most valuable boat is the most obvious and indeed a powerful way to get a lot of points. However, if a few lots go unclaimed, suddenly the prospect of getting stuck with empty holds in your boat becomes a real gamble...especially if you're trying to maximize your shipment's points. Nabbing some cheap cards to bump your commodities up the chart can be another viable way to score fairly big. 

Its tough to correctly value each card for yourself, let alone figure out the relative value to other players. Throw in the increasing stress of not filling your boat (which has a Ra-like push-your-luck element) and this game becomes VERY cut-throat. I LOVE it!

I just wish my older Rio Grande version wasn't so freaking UGLY. The scoring track is ludicrous. I dont' particularly like how the commodity towers are visually represented, but I can at least deal with that. I really would like to get one of the pretty new copies sometime. Its just hard to bring myself to spend/trade for a game I already have.

RATING: 7
Short, yet interesting auction game by Knizia that is often overlooked. I like the decisions involved in choosing between high number domination vs. given suit domination, and the agonizingly low number of items that one can win during the game. I also like the auction mechanic wherein one can make a seemingly good lot rather wretched by adding another card to it, or set oneself up for a real bargain. The main knock I have on this the whole 'bidding with your victory points' thing again. I think it takes something away from the game and makes it more dryly mathematical than it needs to be. Also a little less variable than I would like in an auction game; but still worthy of several plays and very fun. Another Knizia auction game winner.

Pure bidding game but still a lot of fun. Modern Art is more interesting but a bad player in Modern Art can throw the game to someone. That doesn&#039;t happen here. If you enjoy bidding games at all this is a must have. If you can only get one then I&#039;d lean to Ra first then Modern Art but this one should be in consideration. I&#039;m deducting points for only having one element I love.

One play.  My rating is probably skewed because I do not take well to auction games.  But in this particular game the curve seemed even worse than usual.  I was completely out of it by the end of the first turn and spent the rest of the time watching as other players debated on whether or not to turn another card or whether or not to bid.  Sometimes a game like this can still be fun and exciting through theme or interaction but these game has little of either.  I also do not find the game aesthetically pleasing.  I wouldn't ask to play this again, however would be willing to play again if others wanted to.  I acknowledge that with repeated play and increased understanding of the dynamics of the game I might enjoy it more.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español** El juego mas matemático de Knizia junto con el MvsS y el Amun-Re.

Siempre he tenido muchas dudas sobre que juego era el mejor de subasta pura hechos por Knizia pero nunca lo había tenido claro. Con la aparición del Medici vs. Strozzi las dudas se me aclararon, insuperable ¿o no?

Al igual que mí comentario del Medici vs. Strozzi me complace el pensar que este juego es como una especie de Battle Line para gamers pudiendo jugar hasta 6 personas.

Las reglas francesas en la subasta es contínua, en las reglas de Rio Grande la subasta es a una sola vuelta. Otra diferencia es que cuando haces el lote de hasta 3 cartas no puedes sacar más de los huecos que te queden en el barco, con las de Rio Grande sí puedes; yo recomiendo las reglas de Rio Grande.

Si te gusta este juego también es conveniente que le eches un ojo a los siguientes: Schotten Totten, Battle Line, Lost Cities, Medici, Marco Polo Expedition y la serie de 10 days.[/COLOR]

Everyone seems to like this one.  Not me--there are so many good Knizia auction games that I just don't have much interest in this incredibly dry brain-burner.  There is nothing particularly wrong with the game outside of the fact that I don't enjoy it very much.  I'd play it if I had to, but not gladly.

Fun, fast, for a varying number of players.  Simple rules, with pretty deep play.   Miserable art. The cards look too similar to each other, and this carries thru to the scoring pyramids. 

We make the high and low scorers switch chairs for each game.

Very clever bidding game from the Doctor's golden age. It certainly takes a couple of plays to begin to understand what sort of bids to make. Bidding victory points to try to make victory points makes for excruciating decisions. Plays reasonably quickly, even with 6 players.

RATING: 10
Components: Nice boat mats and commodity markers, but my English version has cards with difficult-to-read numbers, lack of color coordination between the cards and their corresponding score tracks on the board, and the most awful score track I've seen, with every other number skipped. One of the few productions that interfere with game play.

The 2006 Rio Grande edition is prettier, and I like drawing the tiles from the bag, but the score track is too small, the markers too oddly-shaped, and the pyramids confusing.

Experience: Game play is great, with three tense rounds of bidding and acquiring my goods. The two ways of scoring give each card a different value to each player, which keeps the bidding unpredictable. This gets better with each play. Works well with 3-6 players.

The only reason I rate the game a 9 is because noone (in my opinion) has really designed a good game board for Medici.  Great game for 5 or 6; I actually like the "perfect information" found in a 6 player game. as a 4 player, I'd probably give it an 8, and I wouldn't play with less than 4.

RATING: 6.7
This game is a lighter game that feels about the same weight as Ticket To Ride. The auction mechanic action is good and spending your points to purchase items makes the game more interesting. I also like that there are a few things to consider when purchasing cards like do you buy that a zero card to help move you up in scoring and item but might not win you points in the round. There's some randomness in the game when flipping cards.

A personal favorite, and the new Grail Games edition with Vincent Dutrait art is a big improvement over earlier editions, although still not perfect(not sure why it's so hard to use colors that are different from each other!). Simple to teach but with some depth, although a little experience is needed to make sure no one wins multiple ships or gets to fill their ships for free each round. Not as good as Ra in the pantheon of Knizia auction games, but still very good.

RATING: 8
Great game. Bidding aspect affecting your end of game points is cool. It's fun to see someone behind the whole game and then, through bonuses, win the game. We played one game where the winner had 127 points, the loser has 117 points and two other players in between. Very simple mechanics. Solid Game.

RATING: 9
A simple game of brain-stunning depth.  This game melts away all the flash leaving the meat of any game at its core -- the assessment of a move's value to yourself and to others.  If it were less dry, it'd get a ten, but as it is, it's still an excellent nine.

One of my favourite auction games. The rules are simple and easy to grasp, yet the game can be difficult to master. The trick is that the game really does depend on the meta of the group, and that the best way to play has to be altered to the people you are playing with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a bad game but the auction is an exercise in math and the more people to track the more you could track. Two decision points are how much to bet relative to what was flopped and who is left of you remaining to bid and how many of the max three cards to flop on your turn. Small amount of card counting and a single auction per turn keeps it to a simple almost filler auction game. Completely themeless.

It is unusual for me not to like one of the Knizia masterpieces, but somehow Medici seemed to be rather boring.  Ra and Modern Art are tense and exciting games, Medici somehow just seemed like work.  Maybe it didn't help that the board was truly hideous.

RATING: 5.75
Very elegant with lots of interesting aspects to it.  The only problem is that I found it to get a bit dry after a while and I'm not really sure why this is the case.  I think it has to do with the fact that there are too many options when considering what to bid so the game takes a little longer than it should.  It also makes the game a bit of a brain burner and grinds to a halt woth people prone to AP.

(I just lowered my rating.  Why, I'm not sure.  I used to think this was one of the most ingenious games.  I guess the reason is it does not have a high "fun" factor, whatever that means.)

This is an excellent game with lots of tension and agonizing decisions. Money is the VPs, but you must spend money to win the goods at auctions. If you pay too much, then you can lose the game. If you're not willing to pay enough for the right goods, then you can lose the game.

Wonderful, pure, Knizia auction game where players bid their victory points for limited auction lots. Players earn victory points for building up sets of purchased goods, and for large sums of purchased goods. The idea, obviously, is to earn the most victory points via cunning purchases. This game is so simple, yet hits the table time and time again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The only one of Knizia's "auction trilogy" that I don't hate.  But my opinion goes down every time I play...  There's never enough competition in the auction, because everyone's going for different colors, so it goes to whoever gets luckiest in the draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent auction game. It is short yet very thoughtful and strategic for a short game. You get one shot to name your bid, that's it. Too low, you don't get another shot and someone else walks away with the goods. Too high means you fill up your hand and you burn away your VP's. One of the few HEAVY fillers I know of. Highly recommended. Very much in common with poker, the more you play the game the more evident this fact becomes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game with interesting decisions. Easy to teach and easy to learn. Good pacing. It seems that players will sit out, inactive, for longer periods of time than most auction games, which is probably the biggest downfall for this game in my eyes. 9 times out of 10 I'd rather play Ra.

Great game - one of my favorite Knizia auction games, second only to Ra.  Medici has the advantage of being easier to explain than Ra.  However, Medici feels somewhat lucky with only 3 players, making Ra especially preferred with that number.  Medici is overall an excellent game, but the Rio Grande edition is U-G-L-Y and it's hard to correlate the goods pyramids with the cards.

UPDATE on the new Rio Grande 2006 edition:  Thank goodness.  Finally, a version of Medici that doesn't make me want to gouge my eyes out.  I also like the change to tiles instead of cards.  If only the little sacks actually fit on the pyramid steps, I would finally be satisfied with the production.

This one has some tense moments and can be pretty fun. But Knizia has much better auction games in Modern Art and Ra.

The pieces just barely fit into the spaces and the slightest accidental bump of a piece can have serious consequences on the scoring.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Medici is a great bidding game.  Because there are two ways of piling up victory points, there's a real trick to balancing your strategies between which method you'll be concentrating on.  The method of using your victory points as your bidding currency was brilliantly conceived.

RATING: 10
In this game you must evaluate the likelihood of getting majorities in competing sets. And you must guess how others will evaluate those same likelihoods. I love both activities, so I adore this game. Bids are tense, rounds are varied, player information is visible, but upcoming information isn't. One downside is the learning curve, which may cause new players to incorrectly value lots and fail to reign in their opponents. But when all players are good at evaluating lots, the game is wonderfully tense.

I dunno if I liked this one.  It is really difficult to understand the value of what you're bidding on and how much you ought to be bidding in the first place.  If you're not good at mental math, steer clear of this one.

At any rate, I found it somewhat unsettling that I was able to shoot from last to second on a single round simply by gambling on 5 random tiles, a tactic that also worked in the first round for another player.  Either everyone else was playing wrong or this is simply just what happens in the game.  Either way, with such huge scoring swings, I find it hard to recommend this one.

That being said, I'd play it again, so it's not like I didn't have a good time.  I just find it hard to say this game is good.

Medici is an excellent game with 6 players. I recently played Medici twice in one evening. Both games were fun and tense.

Traded a copy.

In a recent 6 player game, we were having a blast in the 2nd and 3rd round. It was an extremely intense game.

The fact that you bet only once for the lot of cards is a real thrill. It makes  Medici a lot more interesting than having multiple bids and always over bidding the players like some other auction/bidding games.

In Medici, trying to judge the worth of the lot of cards is great. Is it worth more to you or your oppenents? How much the worth in both cases ? Giving a lot almost for free or paying too much can be a turning point in the game.

I played Medici once with 3 players. I found Medici equally interesting as in a 5 or 6 player game. I was surprise how a 3 player game could be as fun as a 5 or 6 player game. Very enjoyable game overall even though not all the card are been used. The fact that with fewer players, do you take the lot on the table or skip it and hope the card(s) that you want comes out? Hard choice sometimes.

Own two copies. The old one and new one. Traded newer version.

Medici is a Knizian auction game with a once a round bidding mechanism with 3 scoring rounds, similar to Ra. There is even a little push-your-luck aspect to the game as well, but not nearly as much as in Ra. In fact, I would almost call Medici the gamer's version of Ra since lots are tougher to evaluate than Ra and you're bidding with your victory points. That said, one doesn't really replace the other. Even discounting Medici probably being more of a gamer's game, Ra works best with 3 - 4 and Medici with 5 - 6. I've liked the look of all versions of Ra, but Medici's graphic design over various iterations hasn't been the best. This is so true that I decided to make my own board for my copy of the game. If you like auctions, tough decisions, and games that accommodate higher number of players, you owe it to yourself to give Medici a try.

Special note on the French Lui-Meme edition: My board was the worst warped game board I've ever received. Tried to contact them via e-mail for a replacement and it was returned to me as it didn't work.

A very good auction game, if a little abstract. I particularly like the tactile feel of the new tiles and draw bag, even if it does make the round preparation a little more difficult than the deck of cards.

This after one play is probably my favorite of the 'pure' auction games. I feels to me like a better version of Ra, or at least a less lucky version. You may or may not like that. 

More plays have shown me how interesting and good this game is. It's a masterpiece of streamlined design. 

After about 30 months between my last two plays of Medici and literally hundreds new games played in that same time frame, I have found a new zeal for Medici. Medici is the best pure auction game. Period. It's most likely also my favorite game for 5 to six players.

A really fun game. Plays quickly but just the few simple elements give the game nuance and variability. Not as rich as Modern Art or Ra but seriously, that's like saying Mona Lisa isn't as good as The Last Supper. That it does play with 6 could be an advantage, although I've not tried it with 6. Now having a lot of fun with the IPad version.

[1 play] I think the greater interaction and uncertainty with more players made this less awful than Medici vs. Strozzi.  However, it was a great reminder of why I don't like the auction genre much.  This game is just pure auctioniness, in much the same way that Quo Vadis is pure negotiation.  I like auctions OK when they're in a context that gives them some meaning.  Like in Scepter of Zavandor--when there's an auction, I know what I want to buy, and why I want it, and how much I'd pay for it, and what I'm going to do with it when I get it, because all that relates to the other 90% of the game.  Scepter of Zavandor is like a beautiful piece of music, and Medici is like playing scales.  There's no point to it; it's just all about valuing stuff and manipulating the auctions.  I know there are people who find that delightful, but I am not among them.

Regardless of one's feelings about auctions, though, the art design of this game deserves to have some time and space given to denouncing it.  Visually, this game is really poorly done.  There are five commodities that are shown on cards and in five pyramid-shaped pictures on the board.  On the board, they aren't clearly labeled with their names; you have to pick them out by comparing the picture, which you can only see part of, because it's a pyramid-shaped piece of a rectangular picture.  The cards are color-coded, with each commodity having a different color background--but those colors aren't used on the board, so they don't help a bit to match things up.  The names are written on the cards, but in a scrawly decorative script that's not at all easy to read.  The number values on the cards are also in a hard-to-read font and superimposed on top of other stuff.  Given that you're going to spend the game looking around at other people's cards to see what they have and what's been played, and adding up the values of the cards on their ships, it is really annoying to have them not be easier to see/read.  I'd also approve of the score track more if it were numbered on every space instead of every other space.  All in all, the visual design of the game isn't unattractive, but it's definitely not very functional.

One convention of play that we did not use, but that I think would make the game better, is to score stuff as you put it on your ship.  Once you have a card on your ship, it's inevitable that at the end of the round, you'll move up on the pyramid for that commodity.  So you might as well go ahead and do it.  That way, during the round, you're not constantly thinking, "If I buy this lot, it will put me two up in wheat.  That would put me ahead of Alice, but she's also got a wheat on her ship, so we'd be tied.  And Bob has bought two wheat, which will put him one ahead of me.  Etc."  You can just look at the board and see the up-to-the-minute standings and do your calculations from there.  It removes a whole layer of thought and delay, not to mention squinting at cards trying to figure out what they are.

This may be the quintisential 8.0 game, the thing is I don't know if I can just hand it out.  You'll notice from the other things that I've rated that I'm pretty harsh so don't think a 7.9 isn't worth buying.  This is a very solid game, a bunch of fun when you don't feel like the more thinking, more complex games.  One word of advice Don't buy the English version, it's ugly and a little hard to figure out (poor color coordination).

RATING: 6
A great pure auction game for when you want that type of experience. The three round limit is perfect for a game of this type as any longer would make the game too long relative to the depth of decisions you can make. At first the decisions seem plentiful. Should I put up another item for auction? Should I diversify or pursue just a couple items exclusively? Should I overbid/underbid/not bid and try to get the free stuff? However, it seems the best strategy is to hang back, not bid and see what you can get for free. It seems as viable a strategy as fighting other people for known lots. 

I like an auction mechanism in games, but I've determined that I don’t like games that are only about an auction as they get stale. Ostensibly, the auction keeps the experience fresh, but without an action system to tether it to, it simply doesn't hold my interest. Moved this one on after a handful of plays.

Now I have finally played this enough to figure out properly what is going on, the rating has risen from 7 to 8; this is a subtle game of evaluation.  Bid too much you pay the penalty, bid too little you lose the profit.  I still wonder if victory can be achieved by not bidding at all?

With the right group this is very fun. We had each player in the group upset, frustrated, and out bid often. The top three players were within one point of each other. The usual Knizia game elements of competing point scoring options with players dividing their attention for the best victory position among the players. There was also a second track for players to score points on and bid for goods. The points scored here were based on the value of each players cargo, and the points they earned for controlling goods more than others.

Szuper jó licitálós játék, jó sok kombinálgatási lehetőséggel. Két hátrányt éreztem az első játék után:
1. A termékek színe nem eléggé különül el. A tábla amúgy is nehezen átlátható, de ez még ront a helyzeten.
2. Feszültséget tud szűlni a játékosok között az, hogy lehet a játékot viszonylag kevés gondolkodással intuitíve játszani, illetve lehet minden lépésen akár 5 perceket is gondolkdni. Persze ez a probléma csak megfelelő társaság kérdése.


Játszottam vele még kettőt, és sajnos sokat vesztett varázsából. Most nagyon az volt az érzésem, hogy ez a játék 80%-ban szerencse kérdése. Mindegy, hogy hogy kalkulálsz, ha rossz ütemben, vagy rossz setben jönnek fel az áhított lapok, akkor nem tudsz semmit se tenni.

Yet another set collection bidding game by Knizia, and yet again different enough to be worth it. With very little in the way of bells and whistles this pure auction game is about as lean as they come. Players bid on lots of goods that they (hopefully) turn into profits. As the value of a certain good depends on how heavily you are already invested in that good and there are at least two different value dimensions what is a load of junk to one player may be a godsend for another. The auctions are only once-around so figuring out the values of the lots for the other players is quite important, too.

Medici is one of the more freewheeling auction games I've played.  It's quite difficult on your first play to know how much one should be bidding, so you end up bidding quite disparate amounts of money/points in order to win the goods. In the end, there are quite a few other bidding games that I like (I'm not a huge fan of once-around bids anyway) but Medici is different at least and doesn't have any serious faults (except poor graphic design) so I'd play it if anyone asked.

January 2012 -- I've played this game three times. The first two times, I was 4th out of 5 players; the third game I won by a good margin. That does not mean I have mastered the game by any means.

Other than my dislike of the actual game, the graphics could not be less functional unless you tried.  It seems like most of the game is spent craning your neck around the table, counting up other people's cards and points.  Not fun.

Finally logged plays of all three Knizia auction games and I think I would rank them thus:
1. Ra

Which is not to say Medici is bad but it seems like there is perhaps a little less going on in terms of scheming and messing with other players. Over all, quick, enjoyable auction game and still worth adding to the collection.

This game is OK as a pure auction game, where you really must calculate all effects, when you bid. But that makes it a bit too complicated and I think this is drawback. Also board looks terrible, cards are not well designed as well. But the idea and game itself is quite cool, especially when playing it in relaxed environment without calculating every single bid on player's turn.

Medici is more straightforward and more analytical than Knizia's very best auction games (Ra, Modern Art, Taj Mahal, Traumfabrik).  But it's also probably Knizia's most versatile auction game, both in terms of the number of players and in terms of the breadth of its appeal to different groups.  I think I like the five-player game best, although Medici scales well for any number from three to six.

Avoid the early Rio Grande edition with its horrible graphic design, and seek out either the Amigo edition or the newer French edition (which I think will also be carried by Rio Grande).

It's a pretty fun, moderately-light game of optimization, auctioning, and pressing your luck, but I have to deduct at least a point or two for some of the absolute worst components I've ever seen.

I am terrible at this game. I have never won. But I love it. The very simple bidding and easy to understand valuing of items is wonderful. I suppose it could be a bit math-heavy, but I tend not to think about that too much (which I'm sure is why I lose). **UPDATE** I WON, I WON!! (7/15/05) UPDATE - Lost miserably (worse than usual), but the real update is HOLY COW how terrible is the design for the American edition? I'd never played with that one before. Yuck!

Another fun Knizia auction game. Similar to Ra in that it uses a once around auction and that it scores over three rounds but it feels quite different because you are bidding with money rather than with tiles. Very enjoyable.

RATING: 7.99999
The best thing about this little bidding game for me is the way each player hangs on the edge of his or her seat while every other player calculates how much to bid. Most multi-player games have significant lapses of non-active player required attention, this one has every player riveted on every other's bid. Not a lot else going for it though and certainly no relevance to the historic period it references, but always a good in-between game for up to six. Great taste, less filling. Good entry level or introductory game.

I think this, while serviceable and reasonably enjoyable, pales badly next to other Euro auctions games--many of them by Knizia himself. It's fast and good with lots, which is some compensation.
I primarily dislike how swingy the card draw can be. A single card can mean a 30+ point swing, and seating order (or having already won an auction) can mean you're seriously hampered in getting it.

A very good bidding game (and I don't even like bidding games). 

Fast moving game that holds up to 6 players and can be played in an hour.

The rules are easy but the tactics are surprisingly complex.

I find it hard to place a value on my bids and that's half the fun. The value of each auction is different for each player. 

It doesn't really convey the theme - it feels a bit abstract. 

The board is not very attractive - the artwork could have been better, board could have been bigger.

La version de Medici de 1995 est vraiment drabe avec des couleurs ternes. Le thème n'est pas attrayant. La mécanique de miser sur des lots et d'avoir des majorités sur des lots est intéressant.

Enjoyable auction game that is very pure mechanically. Plays 6 pretty well, which is rare for a game like this. Unfortunate problem with people who just want to get random tile draws getting lucky if things come out favorably for them, and it's no fun to lose to someone who just passes constantly but gets a great random draw - in our group this rarely happens but be aware that it's possible.

It's a mighty dry and mathy auction game. It's highly number-crunchy without the exciting twists of something like Modern Art or Container, other mathy games that I enjoy. I could change my mind about it though, it should be noted that I was not that excited about Ra or Modern Art the first time I played them either, but now I love both games. With only 2 plays, this rating is still pretty provisional. Still, I can think of a lot of other auction games I'd rather play. Can you tell I'm a little ambivalent about this game?

The years have been pretty good to Medici, and my opinion of it has firmed up. It's not up there with my favorites, but I do usually enjoy it.

It has one mechanics weakness. The math is simple, but it slows the game down a bit more than most auction games. That said with the right group it's a lot of fun, and well thought out.

 * replace dyes with apples.
 * replace boats with horse drawn carts.

This is an interesting little auction game, where you compete to be the leader in various commodities.  I liked the player interaction.

Downside: I found the game theme uninspiring, and felt like there was little theme and not a lot of depth.  This could be directly related to having a variety of player levels.  It also felt overpriced for the components.

A supposedly 'quick' game that took a while to play with 6 players. The usual trademark Knizia confusing "the cards don't have any value other than the value you give it" bidding mechanic. Theme is thin, but seems to work.  Ra and Modern Art are preferable, as they've got more theme, but the math here to come up with the 'perfect' bid is engrossing. Wouldn't mind playing it again, and I can see that it would play quicker with successive plays.

I do enjoy games where you have to evaluate the future value of items, and Medici is no exception.  I also enjoy the way in which you have to adapt your strategy depending on the apparent mind-set of your opponents - new players and their apparently wild bids can throw a strategy designed to beat experienced players.

I traded this game away despite liking it because I prefer the two player implementation: Medici vs Strozzi.  For multiplayer auction/evaluation games, Modern Art clinches it for me when you have an hour or two, and For Sale when you have fifteen minutes.

It plays six people in under an hour! What a deal.

An auction game where money is points. Each round you can obtain five tiles via auction. The active player draws 1-3 tiles from the bag and decides when to start the auction. It is a one-time around auction.

The main things to consider is the color of the tiles--collecting a lot of the same color and/or having the majority in a color will lead to bonus payouts. Also the value of the tile--the most "expensive" collection of tiles will receive bonuses in descending order.

A fairly early increment of the Knizia auction game, and if you follow the path Modern Art-Medici-Ra-Taj Mahal you soon see that the trend is one of increasing complexity. This is more critically dependent than most games on the number of players. With smaller numbers the game becomes increasingly luck based as more cards are randomly removed from the deck, with 6 you know exactly what's left. With precisely 5 playing this is more fun than most auction games, but Modern Art remains my favourite.

Not a bad game but I need to play more to understand what things are worth (which I have no great desire to do). Worst theme ever, in fact I played most of the game without even knowing the theme.

RATING: 8
Interesting! Ra without the training wheels.  As a heavy but short auction game for up to six players, this does a great job of filling a niche that is important to me. Being able to make money from either the majorities or the values (or both) means that there are several valid ways to go about the game,  some players may be doing better than they initially appear to be, and that, as the game develops, different players may value tiles differently.  I appreciate all these traits in an auction and everything that Medici gives me to think about. I like it better than Modern Art because the values are less calculable--though paying the bank instead of other players makes it a little less.. swingy. (8 plays)

Played my 2nd and 3rd game of this on 7/25/07 which was a good experience. It's a quick teach (~5min) and less than an hour to play for 5 people, around 30 min for 3. I felt very engaged in the game and found myself saying "it's over now?" at the end wanting a bit more. My first experience (1st printing) was not good. The board was busy and hard to read. The cards didn't match the board. Fast forward several years and the cards are replaced with tiles. Personally the card idea was better being easier to shuffle and extract some cards. Making the cards match would have been a better alternative. The square boxes were replaced with spices and roll around too easy enough on the board. One dropped and scattered a few without touching anything. If you could lay the pieces flat, that would fix the issue. The board layout much better in the 2nd printing. The game itself is very enjoyable. There is a good mix of luck and strategy. Not one set strategy that works either, which is a plus. I'd recommend giving this a game play, especially if you know someone who has it. It's worth consideration playing on a regular basis if you like bidding games. All bets are off, if it's the first printing. I'd like to see a 3rd with new board, old squares, and old cards matching more closely.

This game is the poster child for dry, boring Euros with totally pasted on themes.  The game reminds me of doing all that easy, redundant algebra from 6th and 7th grade...except I think I would prefer to do that instead.  The components are laughable and the artwork is absolutely terrible.  -Stupid, bad game.

Apr09: My first play seemed pretty smooth.  It went fast with new players and had a lot of good parts.

I just wasn't expecting the huge role of luck in this game.  When one player got to fill their boat for free, they managed to draw the 10 and the two fives in the color they needed.  That just blew them out of the water in the final scoring.  Left a rather sour taste in our mouth.

I really need to try it with family though since that is what I bought it for.

There is great tension between trying to get similar colored goods and big value goods.  You can't do both and the balance act is tough and enjoyable.

Update:  Tried it with 6.  Very awesome.  Luck was pretty minimal actually.  Just enough of it to add spice to life.  I realized that the bids also involve jockeying to get the "free" flips.

RATING: 6
Generally, I'll avoid any game with a hint of pushing your luck, but Medici fills a hole in my collection for a short game that accommodates 2-6 players, with enough mental stimulation to keep me awake, but not too much to scare away muggles.

I'll only recommend this game towards the end of the night after the main event, if we're short on time, or if everyone in a group of 5-6 insists on playing together. Games with more players are generally more chaotic and less strategic, and therefore less interesting to me, but at 6 players Medici uses the full deck of goods-cards which allows for more concrete evaluations and card counting. Strozzi may be a better "gamers" version of Medici, but it's also more complex, and less accessible for casuals due to the complexity.

:thumbsdown: tactical at the expense strategy(liberal/conservative dealing and bidding and prioritizing what goods to bid on relative to your rightmost opponents.)
:thumbsdown: lack of non-transitive/counter strategies

Another stellar, brilliant and elegant auction game from the "doc" that is an absolute hoot with the right group and right amount of 'friendly tabletalk'. 5 or 6 best I'm sure but I could see ways to "make" it playable with less. Forget about theme, there isn't one and it isn't needed anyway. 

Really a great middle-weight pure auction game with some set collection and some "push your luck" element as well. Some other similarities to "RA" besides those in previous sentence: Slightly subtle strategy, fast pace, once around bidding and can be hard to judge values making for very tough choices but it plays fast and keeps everyone involved. Scoring is as usual very nicely done with a few ways to get points and lots of competition to get them. A dose of luck as in most of his games but also manageable like most as well. Having the option of flipping 1 - 3 cards adds a nice strategic and push your luck element. This is a simple game to learn and play but a challenge to play well. 

I see the rating rising with more plays... 

Strange that such a simple game can't be made with good components, I don't recommend the new french version either but the German version is good. One of the best games I know for 6 players.

Another classic Knizia auction game. Very tight tug of war game between vying for controlling of the 5 resources while at the same time try to win the highest trade value at the end of the round. Card draw has a little push your luck element and could either help you or even help your opponents. As with most Knizia games, this one can be pretty themeless and dry. The art in the new Grail Games edition is gorgeous (that's to be expected from a Vincent Dutrait art :) )

How much to pay? The ultimate question! There is a learning curve to knowing how much is too much, when to bid and when to pass, and when to drop out of a race for a good and go for something else. However once you begin to understand that it becomes a great game. This has joined my lunchtime game groups regular lineup, our heaviest game to date! Though completely abstract I prefer the Amigo version over the Rio Grande and look forward to the new version.

A great auction game from Knizia!  The art is atrocious and actually hinders gameplay as it's often hard to tell which card belongs to which resource (is that a spice or a fabric?)  That's not enough to not recommend it of course as that's forgotten after a couple rounds.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
6 player auction game that works fairly well, that alone excuses any faults that the game may have, although they do somewhat affect my enjoyment of the game

faults:
1) it is possible to win by getting lucky on what cards come out after everyone else has filled their boats, just doing this once during the game and making sensible decisions the rest of the time can be the difference between winning and loosing.

2) later in a round when only 2-3 players are left needing cards, the competition for one type might be limited, potentially giving it to 1 player for close to nothing (the other plays that could make that player pay properly for it, my be sacrificing their chances of winning if they do so)

Very streamlined.  Also, I suck at it.  I respect this game for the decisions it offers, but like a lot of pure auction games it's inaccessible on first play.  For me it's proven mostly inaccessible on fifth play as well.  For an auction game to work for me I need some sort of fixed referent to aid my valuation, and Medici has first- and second-place bonuses, which are fluid.

RATING: 6.5
Finally got to play this. I won by 3-5 points at the end of my very first game. Very close game. Pure bidding and a bit of set collecting are necessary. Evaluation is driven by other player's needs. You spend your victory points in the bidding rounds to get goods.

The redesigned board is nice, much easier on the eyes, but it could still use some tweaking to make the goods columns stand out more from each other (note: look at the symbols of the items, not the colors).

How did I like it though?...hmmm...not sure how to rate it yet; it played smoothly, went fairly quick, not bad at all, but it didn't grab me on whole or light me up for another go right off. I'll start it off with a 6.5, but that's provisional. 

I'll need to play it a bit more to rest on a rating. It's good, it's OK fun, it's got some good player vs. player bidding...it IS a pure auction game at heart though and you WILL have to be able to evaluate your retun on investment vs. needs of the other players; sometimes you will need to stop another player, because no one else has; at those times it's kind of like in multiplayer Attika vs. two player Attika...sometimes no one wants to be the one to have to stop the other guy from connecting.

One of the few games I actually like to play with 5 or 6; also works fine with 4 and not too bad with 3.  Good length, keeps everyone involved, interesting bidding tradeoffs between getting "quantity" or "quality" (more or less).  I also like how you spend your victory points as currency.  A little too similar to my other favorite bidding games (especially Knizia ones) for me to rank it as always-play though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good auction game where your victory points are what you use to buy the commodities that you want. The way the commodities get put up for auction is what really makes this game great. When the auctioneer it is important to know what your opponents are looking for since you don't want to put something up for auction that is only of value to one other player, unless that player is you.

Medici is pure simplicity and excellence in design. There is a deck of 5 commodity types with values of 0,1,2,3,4,5,5. Each turn a player turns over 1-3 cards and they are distributed as a set in a once-around auction. This continues until all players' ship holds are filled or the cards run out. Players can hold exactly 5 cards in a round, so if the set is larger than they can take, they cannot bid that turn. Money is awarded in decending order from the highest valued hold and also commodity types collected are tracked throughout the game, with the most and second most in each commodity getting points each round. That's it. There is no additional end game scoring.

As with all successful pure auction games, this is about manipulating the auction set and influencing the other players to take substandard lots or to frame players out of an auction entirely. Since every lot differs in size and composition, value judgements are required every turn and that leads to some great and fun table talk. These are my favorite kind of medium-weight games - high interaction coupled with crafty decisions.

The production on the KS is very good. I have just a few criticisms, for those interested (this has been an ongoing saga with Medici since first publication):
- Peach and yellow player colors are WAY too close of a match. I mean, Peach??
- The numbers on the score track are hard to see. They are not differentiated enough from the background color.
- The tokens in the middle - which may have been stretch goals - seem to serve hardly any useful function. I know what they do, but what they do is not needed.

As is the case in most of Dr. Knizia's games, the way points are scored creates a great deal of tension as players are constantly doing mental gymnastics with value. I like it a lot.

I've only played the iPod/iPhone version so far. I like how the dynamics change between a 3 player and a 5 player game. There is less control with more players.

I look forward to playing with human beings at some point in the future.

Finally played a game with 3 other human beings. Other than counting issues using the scoring track, game was really good.

The classic once-around auction mechanic. The combination of bidding for values as well as commodity types creates lots that have ever-changing values. You have to weigh what a given lot is worth to you, and what it is worth to your opponents. If something is worth 10 to you but 20 to your opponent, what do you bid? Bid 10 and he'll quickly snatch it for 11. Bid 20 and watch him stick you with an overpriced lot on your ship. And valueing lots is hardly precise; you have to use gut feel to work towards those 10 and 20 numbers. Scales well from 3 to 6, but 6 creates a "perfect information" dynamic because all 36 cards are left in the commodity deck. This game can be an incredible multi-participant battle of wits. One of my all-time favorites! This would be a '10' except that valuation of lots is so difficult that final scores are often not very close.

I really like the auctions, and deciding on the lot you'll auction (something like Ra).  Scoring housekeeping breaks the game's rhythm slightly, but that's fine.

RATING: 8
Based on 10+ plays.  A beautiful, elegant auction game, perhaps my favorite in the genre.  A pity about the shabby Rio Grande components, but they don't really detract from the gameplay.  Playing with novices can skew the game a bit (if they don't overbid when they're "supposed" to), but this feature is not nearly as bad as in, say, Modern Art.

Medici is a simple auction game by Reiner Knizia.  It is incredibly enjoyable though.  I like it best with 5 players (not 6).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
2017-09-28 - 5 - I can play it again but I was disappointed by this game and I prefer Ra and Modern Art much, much more. This one seems just less exciting than the other two and less engaging. It misses some spark that was added in Ra, which clearly bases on ideas from Medici. I don't know if I really need a game for 6 players, but for 5 I can choose something better - two mentioned Knizia games, or Traumfabrik.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Just okay. The colors are hard to see and it's kind of hard to visually track who (which player) is in what position on the level pyramid thing. The fact that determining this will help you win means people take longer on their turns than they otherwise would. It's like a bloated version of [thing=5782][/thing]. I wouldn't refuse to play it, but I don't seek to own it and wouldn't request it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A rare game that plays 6 players really well but still offers a good amount of decision making. I enjoy the mix of auction with a bit of push-your-luck element, the fact that you bid with your victory points is great, it really increases the tension to realize you are paying directly with your end game score. Plays very quickly at a full player count, rarely lasting over 60 minutes even at 6 players.

RATING: 7.5
Each player has a ship that can store 5 cards.  The cards are of 5 different commodities types. The cards also have a value from 0 to 5.  There is one special "Gold" card; it is not a commodity, but has a value of 10.

In turn, each player reveals 1 to 3 cards off the stack (note: if you already have 3 cards in your ship, you can only draw 2, since that is your ship's maximum capacity). Bidding begins with the player clockwise of the dealer and ends with the dealer.  You cannot bid if your ship doesn't have room for the cards and you can pass.  If everyone passes, the cards are discarded...but this can only happen a few times as the deck size is limited.

At the end of the round (when everyone has filled their ships with 5 cards), for each card of a commidity you have, you move your color up that specific commodity pyramid.  You also check to see who has the largest ship by adding up the numbers.  Points are awarded to the highest ranking winners of each of the five commodity pyramids and the largest ship (ties being split).

A very elegant bidding mechanic with short and long term goals.  Do you try for the largest ship this round, or build one of your stronger commodity rankings (as there is a bonus to getting to the pyramid top)?  Do you pass on bidding for now, waiting for others to fill up their holds, removing them from being able to bid on later draws? But how many cards have been discarded at this point?  Would I be pressing my blind luck to discard a few more and risk running out of cards to put in my hold?  Those are questions running through my head.

The early part of the game is easy to max/min.  Towards the end of the game, you'll be examining player's commoditiy pyramid rankings, guessing what they'll be willing to pay for, and hoping to up the bid to make them pay for it, even if you don't want it.

Rating would be higher if everyone has experienced the game and are of equal skill, otherwise this game has huge runaway leader problems.

Reiner Knizia's Medici is the best bidding game I've played. What's best, its easy to learn and one game doesn't take a long (only 30 minutes if everyone knows how the game works). Medici offers many incovenient auctions: you have only one chance to make your offer, so you have to think carefully how much you are ready to pay. This gem offers a lot of bidding and some tactical maneuvers AND what's the best, there is some luck and risktaking elements too. Just terrific!

This is barely a board game and feels more like playing poker or some other "social"/gambling/bluffing game.  Very interesting auction/bidding/gambling mechanic which pretty much never gets old since the fun isn't in the game itself but in how the players play and interact.  Hard to rate compared to games that are actual "boardgames".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This game is so bad and boring. One of the problem is that it is a game for mathematecians. You must be able to calculate the value of a hand in order to bid correctly. But that is way more too complicated to do. At least in RA, you have 3 tokens with a printed value on it to use for bidding. You might not know the exact value of a hand but you can know aproximately what it is worth. So using predetermined values is easier.

May2009 update:  The newest Rio Grande edition with tiles and cardboard ship layouts if a fabulous edition.  I think I like the thick tiles rather than the cards version.  

There seems to be two different scoring systems.  The Amigo, german edition and the Rio Grande, english edition have different bonuses at the top of the  pyramids  (most gamers I play with prefer to only use the top 2 levels of bonuses - German edition).

Probably one of my least favorite of the Knizia auction series but still a solid game, particularly since it can play with 6.  Put lots up for auction, then buy different lots until your 5 hold ship is full.  One can score by having the highest value total in cargo each round as well as scoring points for shipping the most of each individual good over the course of the game.

I hope Reiner Knizia designs could be someday ported to computers.  His design is very well suitable for computerized AI to work on.  This game about trade and power reminds me of the computer Merchants of Venice. Of course, this is only a bidding game, much smaller in scope than the computer game. Haven't found another game with so many session reports...

The above was written in 2009 September.  Since then , with the impolsion of iPhone and iPhone technology, the game was ported to iPhone applications store.  Perhaps I should buy this game app some day in 2011.  Got the iPhone version in 2012.....but it can't be played solitaire.

I'm not usually into push your luck games, but I love the auction + set collection mechanics in this game. Do you grab a decent offering early, or wait it out to get a great deal later? Since the goods vary each round, you could be waiting for an item that never surfaces...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Horrible, fundamentally broken. It looks like you have lots of decisions, but in reality if the cards don&#039;t come up, you lose. Bidding defensively (if a perfect set for another player is flipped) guarantees you&#039;ll lose the game.

I'm generally not a huge fan of pure auction games and this doesn't do a whole lot to change my mind, but within that genre, it's pretty good. Not as arcane or tedious as Ra, at least. It's not something I'd seek out and play, but if it's suggested, I don't have too much of a problem with it.

RATING: 6
Arguably one of Knizia's best. Medici is undoubtedly a very solid game but it doesn't really tick for me and the worst part is that I can't explain precisely why. Maybe it's the artifical theme. Maybe it's the very mechanical feel. I couldn't say.

Another great intro game -- the theme/mechanics are so stripped down and basic that the hook is unavoidable. The concept - bidding the points you'll win with - is so foreign to people not used to these games, that their reaction is normally astonishment.

Delightful! Simple rules, fast, yet with highly nuanced gameplay. At 30 minutes this is an excellent filler, but it is also a great game in its own right, more than worthy of repeated plays. I would rate it even higher if it weren't for the HORRENDOUS, terribly CONFUSING game board and art, at least in the version I have. How could anyone think that eliminating all expected visual clues (such as color coding) would be a good idea I cannot imagine.

This is one of my favorite auction games. I love bidding in victory points, and balancing between the value win and maximizing good types is fantastic. The third round is definitely the most critical though, so if you're going to zone at during the game at any point, do it early. You can recover from a bad first OR second round, but a bad third round will lose you the game.

One of Reiner's better auction games.  You have a virtual ship with five spaces and collect trade goods with values that range from 0 to 5.  You obtain the goods through an auction of 1 to 3 goods which you add to your ship.  If you have the highest value goods on a ship, you get a bonus, second place gets a lower bonus, etc.  Each good is scored as well with the player shipping the most goods of that type getting 10 points and second place getting 5.  If you advance far enough you get more bonuses.

I like the auctions in this game as it is once around and the "auctioneer" rotates each round.

Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Knizia_auction_trilogy

Seems to be a game worth evaluating on its own merits rather than in comparison to Medici vs. Strozi. 

On its own merits, the games seems to employ certain subtleties that make it shine in the same way that Ra, Modern Art, and Hollywood Blockbuster shine in their own right. 

Plays quickly and scales well with increasing number of players.

Exists in different versions. See the following article which discusses pros and cons: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/337237/help-distinguishing-between-the-2-older-card-style

There seems to be a lot of complaints regarding design. Many have suggested using kilgore's design (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/36337/medici-homebrew-remake) which would cost $12 for the canvas board and $10 for the cards. Tokens would be extra.

I like that you get one shot at your bid. If you don't bid high enough, too bad so sad. Some very interesting interactions and depth of strategy to go with this one. Great game, I love it, and highly recommend it!

This game was fun.  I have the Rio Grande version.  One thing that would have been nice is for Rio Grande to have listed the commodity above each pyramid on the game board.  Interesting mechanics and difficult to know who the real leader is till the last round.  There can be a little analysis paralysis in the game though... play it with people who don't over analyze everything!  :)

Glad I finally got around to playing this, and even with the full complement of six players. Which it handled very well; I'd consider buying it just for that. While it is a barely concealed abstract, I feel it has aged very well - add some cheat sheets for scoring and an additional cube set to show who's playing which colour, and it could very well stand up to recently published games.
Played twice.

This game is particularly prone to the auction game problem of not knowing how much things are worth the first time through.

However, I didn't find the game interesting enough to request a second play.  Sure, it might be an ideal distilling of the auction mechanic.  But I don't find auctions for the sake of auctions fun.

3-6p, 60m.  Highly rated (rank 99, lots of 10's) bidding game by Reiner Knizia.
I liked it, but found it drier than other auction/bidding games.  For instance you never sell the commodities you've been bidding on, you only get a bonus based on your rank for value or number accumulated.

The once-around auction is a killer.  Pretty fast and simple.  There's either a lot of downtime if you play badly or none at all if you're engaged in what other players are doing, which isn't a value judgment as the game lets you play both ways.

It seems very interesting, like modern art, but the production is not great.

One of the more difficult auction games I have played. It takes a couple of plays to learn how to adapt to the flow of the auction each game. I like auction games and this is an ok game. However, the board is a nightmare. I played on the round board with auction tiles. I do have to say, I HATE that board. Overproduced, hard to see the scores, the components don't fit on the scoring track... Everything about it is awful, truly awful. If I ever put this in my collection, I would need the older version.

09/29/99 Received. I have the 1999 RGG version. I added labels to the base of the scoring pyramids to better tell the commodities apart. Otherwise there's much confusion between spice, cloth and dye, due to the artwork using the same bright colors for each. 
As of 06/28/17 I've won 29 of 57 games played; 50.8%. A pretty good rate for a game that plays up to six. 

09/11/07 Played using the 2006 edition. It was nice to try the new version of Medici with the tiles, but I still prefer my 1999 version with the cards. Even though I've never been a fan of the hard to read fonts used on the cards in my set, overall I think it trumps the 2006 edition. I can't really think of anything I preferred about the 2006 version. Things I didn't like were: 1) tiles and a draw bag instead of easier to handle/shuffle cards, 2) the tiles are now "non-language specific" and therefore only have a commodity icon and number on them, 3) the wooden "spice bag" tokens are too large for the score track and commodity pyramids, 4) the score track only has numbers every five spaces, as opposed to every two, 5) because of the draw bag its hard to tell how many tiles are left, 5) the background color of the tiles, especially the green & blue, are so muted they tend to meld together at a distance, 6) and I've never seen a dock in a star pattern - quite bizarre. Still, even this version looks better than the 2005 French edition. That thing is butt ugly.

Yes, it's another Knizia auction game. The go-around-come-around style of the auctions is one step up from blind bidding, and the decisions regarding how many cards to lay down versus how many you can still fit in your ship's hold are tough. Also current hold values weighed against the average across the four rounds makes for some agonising. And yet, it's oddly ascetic and uninvolving. Unlike the tension of Ra or the anticipation generated by Amun-Re, this is rather a sterile experience, but not a bad one. I like it. I'm far from loving it, though. Mathematical balance can be beautiful. It can also be sterile.

Another game with a truly terrible board, though.

Nice game! easy to learn, not much to teach. It's a decision game, a fun one, playable by almost anyone. You try to get as much points as possible by buying 5 different goods. You get points for having the most impact in a market and having the most valuable merchandise on your boat. To get points, your wager the ones you have! Nice concept, intersting, but nothing to go crazy about!

Game in a Nutshell: Buy tiles in an Auction to fill the limited space on your ship. Tiles score you points in a couple different ways.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Not an overly complicated game but one that is not easily mastered. Most likely a finely balanced game for players dedicated to plowing through the learning curve.

Cons: The biggest problem with the game is how hard it can be for players to wrap their heads around the abstract values of the tiles they're bidding on. There's nothing to simplify it in players minds like in RA (is it worth one of the few optional bids I have?) or Vegas Showdown (it's going at a bargain of its established starting bid) leaving new players to fuddle through each auction. I'm sure over time players could mathematically get a feel for it, but why? There's plenty of other fine auction games out there to fill the void.

Other: I played the game once and knowingly with the least optimum number of players. Still, the major problems that I recognized didn't feel like they would change no matter how many players are present. I originally had interest in this game after playing RA and was convinced I must like auction games after some initial doubt. Well I was wrong, this is an example of how not to do an auction games. Either give players a reference of value or limit their options to simplify the decision making.

Best Use: For pure, unrestrained auction fans.

Excellent auction game. Reminds me of Santiago with high turn angst, anguising bidding decisions, and omnipresent screwage factor. There is a fine line to walk between keeping your options open but not being stuck with crap. A bit of a luck factor could turn off some players (not me); at the end of each round the last player with empty spots on his ship gets free random cards. I have seen this go both ways to the extreme. Would love to play with 6; not sure about 3 player game.

Played once with four people.  A Knizia-special wherein players are bidding for items (5 types) that have different values (6 values in each of the types).  Players can get up to 5 items each round, and at the end of each round get points for having the highest total value of items as well as for having the most items of each type.  There are two big twists: 1) the currency used for bidding is victory points, and 2) players only get to place one bid on each lot (thus bidding order plays a large factor in the game).  There are very few extra cards, so someone is guaranteed to end up with low value cards.  A good mix of luck with strategy/tactics that requires thought yet isn't too long; I definitely want to play this more.

The theme is irrelevant but the mechanics are so finely balanced that you agonise over whether to turn over another goods card from virtually your first turn.

This one just keeps rising with every play.  Clearly one of Knizia's best auction games.  Clearly one of the most underrated among his most famous auction games (Modern Art, Ra, Traumfabrik,and Medici).

I need to play these games more in order to determine which one I prefer of which one I think is the deeper game.  But I find them all good and all different enough to warrant owning.

After quite a few plays of Medici it slowly becomes apperant that almost nothing that the players attempt to do has much of a true effect on the game. True fact of the matter is that Medici's winner is almost entirely and completely dictated by luck of the draw. Even the greatest efforts that one makes cause you to only be successful as the cards that you pull when you have the power to say the final vote.

Honestly I originally enjoyed this game and thought it was good but over time you realize that your ability to affect and influence the end result is perpetually undermined by the luck of what you draw and what others draw on their turns. So really, what's the point in playing a game that you can't even win by your own effort? Might as well just sit around drawing lots; oh wait, that is what you are doing...

I usually like Reiner Knizia games quite a bit, but this one feels too mathamatical to me.  I think that it's a nice, elegant system, but it didn't seem that fun.  I'd like to try it again, though.

The artwork of the (older) Rio Grande version is so horrible that it detracts from the game.

Recently upped the rating a fair bit after a replay; this is really quite a nice game, actually.

Of Knizia's "simple" auction games (High Society, Ra, Modern Art, etc), this seems the clear winner.

Seems like it's obviously only worth playing with a large cadre of players, but that's true of most auction titles.

Just 1 play so far.  Well, lets address the elephant in the room.  Ra is Knizia's best auction/bidding game, period!  I believe Ra is my favorite auction/bidding game.  However, I don't believe that removes much of the shine from Medici.  Where Medici is superior to Ra (IMHO), is that it is less clunky, plays quicker, and still has the great push your luck and tense bidding decisions.  Also it plays better with 5 or 6 players.  Unless you are playing with less than 4, I believe you will enjoy this game.

A very solid auction game. I can see why some people consider this one of Knizia's best. The rules overhead is very simple, and while I think that the board is a bit superfluous, the decision space is vast. There's majority scoring, which I normally don't like, though it works well here. You also can't overlook how much money you'll get from having the most valuable ship. I really like that the points spread is dependent on the players, so this game caters to newbies and experienced players alike. There is no "right" way to play this, and the game can evolve with the players. This is something most auction games fail to do, but Medici does it with flying colors. This is the ultimate gateway game to auctions, though I still prefer Ra.

An old Knizia game where one is trying to fill their boat with valuable commodities. Each turn, 1 to 3 cards are flipped up which people bid to load on their boat. The cards represent six different commodities and range in value from 1 to 5. There is also a commodity neutral card with a vaule of 10. Players can load a maximum of 5 cards onto their boats. Points awarded for largest value boats and the same type of commodities. There are some tactics, such as being the only one being able to hold 3 cards, flipping 3 cards, and only paying $1 for it. I know a lot of people like this Knizia classic (along with Modern Art), but I prefer Ra and Taj Mahal. Perhaps I'm trying to compare this game to those ones, but I prefer his games where there are multiple paths to victory. A bit dry to me.

PROs: This is a fantastic auction game! In fact, if I'm introducing new players to the auction game genre, this is likely the game I'll pull out. The tension in bidding just the right amount to cause someone to face palm is so much fun! I love the push your luck element when choosing what tiles to put up for auction based on your gut instincts on what the the other players want.

CONs: Depending on the edition of the game you have, the score track is not very easy to read due to poor formatting. As a result, it can be confusing when moving your token up and down the track.

Lui-Meme edition. Kudos to Reiner Knizia who has designed so many auction games with different twists. I'm not usually a fan of auction game (especially when it's the sole mechanism of the game, a la Modern Art), but some of the auction games I enjoy do always seem to come from Knizia. It can be extremely tough to evaluate things properly, but nonetheless an enjoyable experience.

I do wish I had the German edition, though - the Rio Grande version's board is not as well designed. *UPDATE* Acquired the German version... woohoo! Another 6-player game moves this to a 9. The German version is mcuh superior, though we do use the 5-point bonus rule that was added to the English version. I seem to have a knack for this game, too - my last game was a 50-point win over the nearest competitior! **UPDATE 6/4/04** Another near-50-point win in a 6-player game :-)

RATING: 8
Rating after one play.  Simple, deep, and addictive.  The Rio Grande board is hideous, though.  As bad as can be.  The fact that the game still shines despite that shortcoming is a great testament.

----update---
After a few plays this is a solid 8.  A touch too dry to break into the top tier, but definitely good enough to be an easy recommendation.  Needs all players to be of equal level (or at the very least trying to play well) else some players can pull ahead based on the weak play of others while others sit helpless on the sidelines.  That (and the art) are the only bad things I can think of to say about Medici.

Ultimately, Medici didn't stand out in the crowded field of auction game and was traded.

An interesting twist on an auction game, as your ship scores in two ways, both of which you need to balance.  I prefer Modern Art for its diversity of auction styles, and its nuances.  For a lighter game, I'd lean toward RA.  This one's somewhere inbetween.

This is still a good game, and one that I'd gladly play again.

I've played this dozens of times on iPad but haven't touched it since a very lame live 3er. But I did enjoy the virtual 6-player games I played and think the experience will translate well.
---------
Yeah, it was OK with 6. Seating matters a lot, and of course luck of the draw plays a factor, too. But definitely the most experienced players should not sit next to one another; it hurts the one(s) to the right, unless they are very good at consistently bidding to the exact number without going over. The game itself is diverting, though not super compelling.

[size=9][b][c]OVERALL REVIEW:     :star::star::star::star::star:[/c][/b][/size]
[size=8]A great auction game with some take-that forcing of the hand. The double scoring method for the cargo values and separately, the cargo goods, plus the bonuses at the top of each warehouse track, are all brilliantly simple game design. Every player attempts to strategize their bids with the potential dominant scoring opportunities. All the while, every auction is random, and clever players can force you into purchasing something beyond its value or urge you to press your luck with the next auction.

We use the ships as player markers in front of each player and use real coins as a more tangible currency and perhaps easier to count, Also the warehouse markers have been replaced with colored cubes instead of cardboard chits, and are a little easier to see on the warehouse tracks.

Auction game. Unless you like auction games, and want to learn them it's not worth playing. You need to play several times to get a feeling for what anything is worth, and I just don't like to suffer that much. I'm very tempted to drop my rating for this game, I don't find it interesting or enjoyable at all. It's less interesting than trying to pick stocks. You never know what order things are going to come in, the last player can get a lucky draw. I'm sure there is a decent game for people who like this kind of thing, but for me it's excruciating.

(I own a new edition from Amigo with cards instead of tiles)

A good auction game with very simple rules. I like how you should try to maintain balance between collecting (right) sets and getting high valued cards also. Bidding isn't forbidding as it is once-around and you get one chance per load. Probably best when played with 5 players as then there is enough action in auction but still (just a bit) of randomness from cards as few aren't used per round.

only have done a test game so far, and it was really enjoyable... i get the feeling that this game could have a much more strategic (less lighthearted) feel about it if the players were more familiar with the game. This game could also get a nice bump in the ratings with a few more plays.

I'd really like to play this again especially with a group of 6... this is a Great Quick (1hr) 6 person game

[2010/01/09]

okay played again, and it was really fun again.... i get really goofy  when playing this, and i think it's because people are forced to make bets that are difficult to calculate... it's so enjoyable to poke fun at someone (who made a resonable bid) just to get them second guessing themselves.

This is an auction game, and each person gets 1 bid per item... I cant believe i like auction games this much,.. but i really do... my wife kicks my but (and everyone elses in this) but you don't need to win, it's fun just to play

- A really fun auction game with extremely simple rules and difficult decisions. Your success in this game comes down to how well you bid/manage your money.
- Tension: this game is packed with it, I really can't believe how much fun this game is. You really have to play it; Medici is not as dry as it seems. There is plenty of take that and jockeying for position throughout the game.
- I love any game where you are constantly reading people and past behaviors influence the decisions you make.

I was finally able to play this great game from one of my favorite designers! As competing merchants, players bid against each other to load up their ships with goods and spices to sell across the sea. So it's bidding, set collection and push-your-luck; some of my favorite game mechanics. If you're willing to stay in longer than anyone else, you might get a huge payout (I did) but you also might end up with nothing! It plays pretty quickly and I love the fast turns of an auction game.

We picked up a copy when it was first released. It has been a favourite ever since. A good, tight multiplayer game - always competitive. Very good game mechanics.

Games last about 45 minutes. It tends to be the first choice for a short game if the main game of the evening finishes a little early.

My daughters have now started playing (aged 11 and 8) so it is getting an extra workout.

Great with 4-6 hardcore gamers, or around the table with the family.

Not my favorite auction game, but good.  It feels like I should like this with the limited number of bids won, as in Ra.  Without the random round end, and instead allowing everyone to fill their boats with something, it loses a little of the push your luck feel.

RATING: 6
I've never really warmed to this one. It's a series of once around auctions after the active player turns over 1, 2 or 3 cards (valued 0 to 5 in 5 suits) and puts them up for auction. The game has 3 rounds, and nearly all the cards come out each round. The aim is to get the highest valued collection, plus to get first or second in the number of cards collected in each suit. Each player can only collect 5 cards in a round.

The problem is that if a great set of cards come out that suits one player but no one else, it's easy for everyone to decide not to risk falling on their own sword and allow that player to get it cheaply. If only one or two players are implementing the 'upping' skill, they risk damage to themselves and others gain at no risk. Especially as its a one shot bid. Therefore the winner can be the result of who is luckiest in getting the cheapest auctions because no one else is interested in that colour or whatever.

The plus is that there's lots of opportunity for ribbing, bagging and egging on.

Few games play 6 this well. I've now played every version of this game. Prefer the French edition.

Nice that there is no real downtime as everyone always involved.

I think the extra cards in the French version are definitely a good twist, too. You can play with or without them.

Often compared to Ra and the gameplay does feel a bit similar. Bidding in Medici requires more precision due to the absence of discrete bidding markers. Money=points so you are bidding with VP's. Both games have their advantages.  Ra is more clever, but Medici is more pure, as cheesy as that sounds.

A game I first played about a year before purchasing, and really enjoyed. Have tried it now with several different groups, from my parents (who are in their 70's) who took to it surprisingly easily, to serious gamers who also liked the cut throat elements to it. I can't get enough of it at the moment.

Well I was only so-so on Medici, but I unexpectedly played it again and thought it a fine little euro, on a par with Tower Of Babel.  An abstract game with tricky decisions all the way, scales well across player counts, and doesn't take too long.  Nice.

I am not crazy about Rio Grande's re-design, with uncharacteristically poor graphics by Franz Volwinkle.  Graphically, this game is cursed.

RATING: 6
Of Knizia's well-known auction games, I like this one the least.  Once-around auctions give people who aren't the last person very little power, and I find tile evaluation very difficult in this game.  After your boat is full, sitting around watching isn't very fun either.  However, the fact that it scales to six is certainly a plus.

5-13-13: rating of 9 based on one play.

Oct 2014: The graphic treatment on the version I have is hideous. The fact that this game is so great has nothing to do with graphics, and everything to do with the mechanism.

I never hesitate to pull this out when I have the right mix of players. Generally it plays well with non-hardcore gamers, and they frequently do well at it.

I liked the different ways to score points, by boats or by leading in the five resources.  I liked how the auctioneer chose how many cards to bid.  The bidding was competitive and streamlined for a once-around-the-table.  The game played quickly and was easy to learn.  It was interactive with watching your opponents as well.

The game only had three rounds, so not equal for each player having a start.  The board had poor color choices between wheat&spice and indigo&cloth, not to mention not always having matching symbols, led to frustration of which resource was which.  Game can be difficult at first determining appropriate bid values.

REALLY didn't like this one.  This made me think I wouldn't like economic/bidding  games, but I liked Modern Art.  I got behind with no way to catch up on the game I played with very experienced players.  Very boring to me. July 2012 update:  Gave this one a second chance, and I think I see some potential. It just sucks to be a new player. The idea seems to be to try to make an educated guess about what the set would be worth to your opponents.

Easy to learn, quick and elegant bidding game.  Since there are different ways to attain profits (and you can only achieve a couple of them per round), it makes for a very tactical game.  Plays best with 5 or 6.  Although I love how easy this game plays (and the Madison Board Gamers do), my other group doesn't, and they always reject it when I choose it.  I'm still not sure why.  It's much more balanced and less luck-driven than Ra (perhaps that's the problem?)  American version is not only ugly, but confusing. (spices and cloth, in particular confuse people.)  This is one of my faves.

Although you won't find me wandering a post-apocalyptic world with a battered copy of Medici, it certainly is a fun, short game.  With experienced players this game can be completed by a fivesome in a half-hour.  In games with a lot of players and in games with any remarkably poor or inexperienced players, there are unfortunately many opportunities (both inadvertant and otherwise) for kingmaking in this game so it will never be a classic to me. All the same, it is quick, quick, quick and it is the purest auction game in my collection.

RATING: 6
It would be a much better game if the board and cards weren't so artistically stylized that even people with good vision and absolutely no color-blindness at all can't tell what the cards are or the game status is at a glance.

The board itself has a clever design, but is too dark and the images so similar that it is difficult to tell the difference between the cloth and the dyes.  The scoring track is atrocious (whose idea was it to put a symbol for the even numbers?).

Update 09 Aug 2007: reduced my rating from 7 to 6. Luck of the draw is so dominant that one can come back from way behind and win the game on the very last draw.

------------------------------------------------

I played this game with high expectations and was somewhat disappointed. A hallmark of an overtly luck based game is when you hear players saying things like, "Only if one of those two cards was a red", or "I would have scored 20 points more if instead of a '4' card, a '5' card had turned up." This is a frustrating game that makes you feel you have little control over your set of cards and thus your score. Of course planning and strategizing do matter but the right cards coming up at the right time go a long way towards helping you do well. 

The production of the board and the cards have some monor problems too. Some of the numbers on the cards are hard to read from accross the table without extra effort. But overall the game has good redeeming values, including: creating a sense of suspence and keeping you on your toes most of the time; very good player interaction; the satisfaction one gets from winning a 'bargin' auction, and pretty good replayability value. I enjoy playing the game periodically.

10 parties - Graphiquement, ce jeu (l'édition française) est peut-être le plus beau de ma ludothèque (avec mon jeu de Go). Le style moyenâgeux des cartes, apporte un cachet de "Classique" à ce jeu, comme s'il avait traversé les siècles pour venir jusqu'à nous. Les cartes sont si belles qu'elles me donnent envie de les réutiliser pour d'autres jeux chaque fois que cela est possible. J'aimerais posséder un jeu de 52 cartes du même genre. Félicitations M. Ehrhard !

Concernant le jeu lui-même, je suis toujours surpris quand je lis que certains le trouvent fun et rapide. Je ne sais pas y jouer sans me lancer à chaque enchère dans un calcul d'espérance de gain pour moi... et pour mes adversaires. Le jeu devient ainsi particulièrement long, calculatoire, aride, et même épuisant ! Je précise que je préfère les enchères à un tour, et vu le temps que j'y passe, ça vaut mieux.

Mon problème est que si ces calculs m'évitent de faire de grosses erreurs (et placent mes adversaires face à des alternatives indécidables), ils ne me permettent pas pour autant de gagner à coup sûr. Je comprends bien que je calcule une "espérance" de gain et que celle-ci n'est réalisée qu'en moyenne, toutefois tout ces bons calculs sont balayés dès que certaines situations incontrôlables surgissent telles qu'un dernier joueur qui acquièrent pour rien un lot de 3 cartes qui complète idéalement son chargement (s'il tirait 3 cartes sans intérêt, le résultat serait tout différent).

Un jeu à la fois très calculatoire et gouverné par le hasard ne me paraît pas une bonne combinaison, et ce jeu me laisse toujours perplexe même si j'aime bien y jouer de temps en temps, mais surtout pour avoir une bonne raison de manipuler ces cartes magnifiques. Le plus souvent, je préfère jouer à Modern Art, un jeu avec un vrai thème, vraiment fun, qui se contrôle mieux, et qui n'est pas plombé par des calculs savants.

Medici is a good bidding game for those who want to analyze everything.  There is no hidden information. Though it is far better than Ra, it lacks the special scoring twist that seems to mark a Knizia game.  I like Modern Art better but if you have players that play quickly then this game is great. Slow players can kill this game as they over analyze everything.That said, this is one of the few games that I had to purchase a second copy because we actually wore it out.

Exploitable auction game: if one player just waits to be last with three slots (and everybody lets him), then it's fairly pointless. Other than that, decent auction game that feels more like a set collection game.

RATING: 7
The game is fairly fun, but the board leaves a lot to be desired. The player pieces are bigger than the spaces, which leads to a lot of "Uh, was I on this space or that one?" The color coding also can be a little confusing when you first start.

All in all, it was enjoyable, but there were a number of little gameplay tweaks I think would have made it more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Medici suffers in my estimation in comparison to Ra. Like Ra, it has player-generated lots up for auction, the valuation of which varies widely between players. But what makes Ra brilliant is the discrete bidding tokens, which reduce the amount of calculation needed while making the decisions more interesting. Medici also has something of the push-your-luck element of Ra, for the person who stays in a round longest. But the risk (running out of goods because some have been jettisoned) seems to affect play much less than it does in Ra (all the Ra tiles being drawn before you get to bid). 

I've recently played several more games of Medici on my iPhone. I was enjoying it at first, though it does make it obvious how few decisions there actually are in a game. But I've now discovered that the AI opponents systematically over-value lots. I've won several times in a row by a wide margin, by simply refraining from bidding on almost everything. Filling your boat up for free is very powerful, combined with occasionally paying more for a lot that's just what you need. I guess the balance that comes in with real opponents is that if everyone tries to do this, lots of goods get jettisoned, which means you have to start bidding higher again to avoid getting locked out completely. 

But hey, it's still pretty good :)

A very streamlined and easy-to-learn pure auction game. There's a fun push your luck element to this game.

The artwork in the third edition is more beautiful, although some of the colors are difficult to distinguish.

Sept 2017: Downgrade from 5 to 3.

A bit torturous to play. It's possible to win two auctions early in one round and have nothing to do until the end of the round.

A prime example of an issue I have with so many Euros: the best strategy is to focus on something no one else is focusing on.

Also, I'm awful at auction games. 

Jan 2008: Pros: Plays up to six, and plays reasonably fast.

Cons: There isn't really much to do in this game. Most of the time is spent passing. For instance, if you fill your boat with three cards early in the round, you'll end up getting locked out of many auctions. The tension in the game is mostly from hoping that what card gets flipped over will be good for you, which to me is disappointing.

This is a very enjoyable game to play.  There are three rounds.  Each player has a ship card with five open holds for cargo.  Players take turns to randomly draw out 1 to 3 cargo cards from a bag  The cargo is then put up for bid.  Each cargo card has a value of 1 to 5 and one gold card worth 10.  You want to fill all the holds on your ship with cargo.  The round ends when all the cargo cards have either been purchased or discarded.  Scoring a round:  The ship with the highest value receives 30 points and depending on the number of players others may score.  After scoring the ships, the cargo is scored.  This is done by each player calling out the number of each product they have.  Your counter is moved up the ladder by one for each card.  The player at the top of the ladder scores 10, the second highest player scores 5.  Ties are split rounded down.

A decent artist must have been desperate for paper, since he painted all over this purely abstract mathematical puzzle, and I can't think of any other reason he would have.

I want to like this game.  Using VPs to bid with multiple areas of focus to score is appealing.  However, having played this with 6 players, I was left highly disappointed by numerous aspects of this game.  First, the once-around bidding makes the game highly dependent on seating order.  Second, there just weren't enough rounds to overcome someone who obtained an early concentration with bonuses (especially if they obtained them cheaply with luck).  I'd like to try it again with fewer players to see how limited tiles alters the game, but this game feels far more luck-based than skill-based.  5 Players was better, but the once around bidding still feels like a negative.

Nice and simple auction game, though it seems the option to not bid early and get goods for free later can be a bit powerful, and if all players attempt this strategy it can really mess with the game. Theoretically, this should balance out as players evolve their strategies around this flaw, but I haven't played enough times to see it work.

UPDATE: Increased rating. After more plays, the no bid strategy seems too chancey. Keeping valuable cards out of other players hands is essential. The auction is wondefully tense, especially in the final round when so much is on line. Really loving this game,

One of the least successful of Reiner's auction games.  Too much hangs on the turn of a card.  Unlike Ra where each set has some, often different, value to every player; Medici can have sets with no value to anyone, or worse, sets of immense value to one player with negative utility for the person who "takes one for the team".  Edition I've played most had almost unreadable graphics.

Probably my favourite game. A very clever auction system, with clean and elegant rules. Brutually cruel decisions each turn, as you want to bid for numbers and colours. 

I spent ages tracking down a copy of the Amigo (i.e. German) edition, as the Rio Grande version is ugly and nigh-unplayable due to poor graphic design.

RATING: N/A
Knizia classic.

Calculate the odds, make the right bids and you will win the game.

This rewards slow-playing rather than bidding aggressively to win a good round.

This game rewards multiple plays.

Highly recommended.

Too much luck for me.  If the game lasted more rounds, the luck would ballance out more I think.  Also we usually play it with 3 players, which I don't think is the sweet spot for this game.  I have the Rio Grande version and the graphic design is pretty poor.

Played it a few more times with 4 players and it is working better.  Feel rating (for 4) is 5.5 to 6.  It definitely plays better with 4 or 5 people.

This game of merchants acquiring goods is full of spectacularly difficult decisions and is engaging throughout the entire course of the game.  Using victory points as a currency is a great mechanic that I usually like a lot; Medici is no exception.  The only downside is that letting one player get too many cards for free at the end of the round can create a runaway leader quickly, but only if they get lucky and have a good draw.  Nevertheless, the simple rules but difficult decisions make for a great game.  This is one game though where I don't feel like I play particularly well, but am always in the running for the laurels - I wonder what that means.

Brilliantly simple game of auctioning. Balance ship capacity, goods majority bonuses, and cargo scores bonuses to earn the most money, all while trying to deny your opponents what they need. Choose wisely as you can only bid once per lot and ship space is at a premium. Overpay and you will lose, wait too long to make your move and you will lose, waste space on the wrong lot and you will lose. Plays very differently for 3 vs. 6. A great game from Knizia.

Tenho a edição da Rio Grande e creio que é um jogo bestial, com uma jogabilidade complexa, dentro de uma simplicidade muito grande, pois o jogo explica-se em minutos e garante enorme replayability. Não gosto dos componentes, nem do tabuleiro; creio que um colosso como este merecia melhor atenção nesses detalhes.

QUITE GOOD BUT MIDDLE-GRADE KNIZIA
I seem to have an affinity for Knizia games and I did enjoy this one.  I only rated this a 6 because I'd much rather be playing one of his other titles such as Ra, Samurai, or Modern Art which to me are superior ways to spend your gaming dollars and gaming minutes.  Perfectly nice game though.

ELEGANT. One of the best Euro games ever. The graceful auction element coupled with the limited resources cultivate a very competitive atmosphere. There are times to try to get the most valuable boat, but was it a smart move if you paid through the nose for it? The goals are more tangible (less abstract) than most German games and mesh well with the flavor. You want to dominate whatever commodities you can and strive for valuable boat values, and get them at a cheaper price than your opponents. Best when maxed out at 6, but plays great with as few as 4. Knizia's masterpiece! (see my article for this game for more details)

Medici is one of those rare auction games that doesn't need a few dozen plays to get the hang of, valuation of lots is quite straightforward and it's as much about opportunity denial than it is about bagging the perfect lot.

As such, the beauty of the game lies in balancing going out early with something good for you or staying in long enough to make sure your opponents have to work hard for theirs.

... so yes, it's very very good, though I haven't really worked out the sweet spot in term of player count yet.

I find it difficult to define my bid. The fact that there's only one opportunity to place a bid makes it even more difficult. I guess it takes several games before I can judge about a suitable bid. On the other hand it's clear to see how I can earn money (=victory points). The rules are not complicated and after my first game I wanted to play another one right away.

I liked my first play of this. It boils down auctions to just the numbers, with a sprinkle of push-your-luck. Though this is auctioning distilled, I can't help but think I'd rather be playing For Sale. There seems to be more "gaming of other players" in that one, than is here. Certainly more opportunities to do so in Ra, and in more subtle ways, in Modern Art.

I just bumped this from an 8 to a 9 after playing it again, and re-experiencing the weird crystalline perfection of this design. Kramer loves Go, and Knizia loves poker.

I own the RG edition so that probably explains the low rating.

RATING: 8
A top-notch Knizia auction game. It's up there with Ra for near-perfect fillers. A game of efficiency with plenty of painful choices. Precision is required, as you will be bidding your victory points as currency.

Played the RGG first edition that is truly ugly. The current RGG edition pumps up the graphics and production values at the sake of functionality. There is a French version which looks great, but I hear that one is also less than functional. It's unfortunate that the elusive German first edition is the best of the bunch.

That balancing act is a ton of fun, and the game plays pretty quick even with six players.

Medici is surely one of the most important Knizia designs, but for me it remains second tier, possibly because I have less experience with it.

One of the three games in Knizia's auction trilogy. I have yet to play Modern Art, but I think this is probably the worst one of the three. Not saying its a bad game, but relative to the other two, this game is on the bottom. I think maybe the artwork in this game threw me off a little. Its just so bad.

RATING: 7
For a pure auction game, a lot of what makes it interesting is ensuring that the lots up for auction have dynamic values. Medici has mechanics to include these changes, but compared to modern art, they tend to be simplistic and fairly dry.

As a result, this creates a clean auction game. But, the trade-off is that the mechanics are a bit dry.

I was looking forward to this game for sometime. The rules are simple, and the game is quick. I've yet to grasp all the strategy, but auction games in general are not my forte. You definately need to win largest ship at least once to be in the running. I was a little disappointed in the components, not really their quality, but the artistic aspects. The board is extremely busy, the cards are small and hard to read, and the artwork is confusing. I much prefer the simpler and more restrained German version.

This is a great filler/warm up game for anywhere from 3 to 6 players.

RATING: 7
Medici -- German edition preferred -- I'm a big fan of Rio Grande games, and the artwork in their first edition is quite nice, but because each trade account depicts its "ware" in multi-hued art, it can be difficult to differentiate the wares. The AMIGO edition uses art as a background, while each ware has a different color trade account, thereby making it easier to differentiate.

[i]Update 25 March 2006:[/i] Played a four-player game using the French edition. It has a beautiful board, and it depicts the wares on the scoring tokens -- smart, that. But the scoring track is half as long as the original, and since score is used for bidding, a longer scoring track is more desirable.

[i]Update 27 May 2007:[/i] The 2007 Rio Grande edition is quite beautiful.  Yes, the tiles make it more difficult to remove some tiles from play without seeing their faces, but their sturdiness makes up for that shortcoming.  The player tokens represent sacks (à la Goa) and while I prefer the custom ware tokens in the French edition, the sacks are still theme-appropriate.  However, the size of the tokens reduces their utility -- If they were half as thick and had a slightly smaller footprint, this would not be an issue.  I think the board layout is attractive, but one player complained that current standings were not as visually intuitive in this edition's concentric rings as in the original edition's horizontal alignment -- I have to agree.  The ware symbols on the board are too easily covered by tokens, making it difficult to distinguish which track represents which ware.  This would not be an issue if the ware colors were distinct from one another.  However, that is not the case.  It is far too difficult to distinguish the colors of the wares both on the ware tiles and on the board.  This edition comes so close to what it should be, but the color distinction issue is a deal-breaker.  The original AMIGO edition is still my favorite.

Played one 3P and one 5P game. Medici is a streamlined series of auctions, and the easiest to learn among Knizia's auction trilogy. In this game of majorities, players purchase 5 goods for their ship every round. At the end of every round, players score if they have the highest total ship values, as well as if they have the most of a certain good. 

As the optimum prices to bid on goods are more sharply defined as the round goes on, it creates a situation ripe for AP to occur. Thankfully, this burdensome analysis is somewhat reduced by the push-your-luck factor when revealing goods, which also adds some strategic considerations on when to flip over more cards. 

There is no denying that Medici is a fine pure auction game, but it involves more number-crunching than I would like. There's a reason why I enjoy Ra, as it hands you 3 discrete values to bid with during a round, while Medici requires you to fine-tune those values to do well.

2015: 8. Comments based on several games against the AI in the iOS version.  I investigated Knizia's auction trilogy (at least Ra and Medici) via iOS rather than trying to hunt down old copies of the game. I quite like both, despite the fact that both apps are in need of an update.

With Medici, you need more careful and canny bidding, as you can easily put yourself in the hole if you're not careful.  Sometimes you need to know when to call another player's bluff and force them to buy something they didn't really want!  I really like the dual objectives of trying to get the high boat, which is nearly mechanically disconnected from trying to maintain your first/second position in the goods, or pushing hard in one or two categories.

Of the two, I *think* I prefer Medici, but I need to play both games against humans to know for sure.  Looking forward to what the 2016 new edition looks like!

2016: UPDATE: 8. With the right group of people, this is a very strong game. Easy to explain, plays fast, beautiful to look at and is full of great moments of staring down your friends and trying to name their price juuuuust right.  Excellent game!

2017: UPDATE: 8.5. Have played now with a couple different groups of non-gamers/gamers, many who were unfamiliar with Knizia's designs. With one exception, everybody has really loved Medici and most said "let's play again!" immediately after!  Great addition to my collection, glad I got it!

Probably the most thought-provoking auction game that I've played so far. Players only get one bid per lot, so there is a lot of tension. Bid too high and you limit your ability to outbid your opponents later on. Bid too low and you might miss out on the most valuable "cargo load" or bonus points for the most of a particular commodity. One wrong move in any of the three rounds and you can spoil your chances for victory. Unforgiving, but a fast game that is lots of fun...especially for an auction game.

Auction. Initial rating after two 3p plays. It seemed a little weak with 3 players, I'm guessing it gets much better with more players. Rating will likely go up if that turns out to be the case.

EDIT: just found that I played a major rule wrong. Need to try this again soon.

Update: played 4p once with correct rules. Much better. I'd like to get more plays, and try with 5-6p.

Last Update: I liked it well enough but the rest of my group didn't, so away it went.

RATING: 6
I'm not a fan of the once-around auction in this game.  There's too much luck in the cards to justify this type of auction.  You really need good luck with card draws when it's your turn as "auctioneer" or else the benefit of going last in the auction is worthless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my all-time favorites.  Easy to explain (despite poorly written rules) and yet very deep play, and scales very well for any number of players (we find 3 players to be fun and fast as long as you are less random of which cards are weeded out of the deck).  The US version has a scoring track that's awkward to use and problems differentiating the various commodities.  The new French edition fixes those problems but tries to print colors on cardboard that fade badly, making it hard to tell whose stuff is whose, but adds some interesting new cards (it appears that some of these are still being debugged here on the Geek).

It's okay.  However, I think the two-player Medici vs Strozzi version is much, much better.  Sometimes that happens when you learn the second version of a game first.  The second game of Medici that I played was a six-player game in which I won.

Bought this and Puerto Rico on the same day.  Took this out at the end of a gaming session, around 10:00 p.m. to try with the group.  Did not go over very well, whether because of the time or the original difficulties with the bidding vs. value concept.  Finally got in another couple of games months later, but again, the game just didn&#039;t excite us much.  Bidding seemed kind of arbitrary and rather boring.  Seems like there are better games to take up our time.  Finally sold the game on BGGM.

Fun for newbies, but strategy comes in when you have played this game a few more times. If you want to win, you have to make accurate calculations. Better to play with 4 or more players. My first impression of this game when i first played it was awesome!

On first hearing what this game was I didn't fancy it at all. On having played it once, despite doing pretty badly, I actually really liked it and would certainly play it more in the future.
It stems around bidding for goods and is all about good bidding and money management.

I will go to the wall saying that this is undoubtedly THE most elegant auction game.  As usual, Knizia shines with simplistic designs.  There are only a few decisions in each round, but the permutations make every choice a tough challenge.  For a pure auction game they don't come any better. It is a shame that the Rio Grande version is so ugly that it'll make your eyes bleed.  If you can find it get the Amigo version (still ugly, but playable).

This one gets an extra point for playing six, easily, inside of an hour. This is yet another Knizia game where the system is set up in such a way that it's almost impossible to discern a decent strategy, and extremes of luck can really make or break someone's score. A good game, like all of his stuff, but not one that I like well enough to play often.

The best strategy is often just to do nothing. Save your money and let Lady Luck fill your boat for you. You'll beat the ones who spend every penny on the perfect boat every time.

For this reason, the two-player variant, Medici vs. Strozzi, is by far the superior game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good, short game, but the graphic design of the (original) Rio Grande edition is appalling -- a scoring track with every second space unnumbered and decorated with an irrelevant and confusing symbol; commodity pyramids identifiable only by busy underlying graphics (is that spices or dyes in those bowls?); and cards numbered in a fussy script that is impossible to make out at a distance of more than two feet. Whatever were they thinking?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Raised my rating from 8.0 to 8.5 - not my favorite game, but it is growing on me. The increasing need to get specific card types coupled with the need to claim high number cards to maximize bonus amounts makes the game feel more deliciously tight and tense, especially so with 6-player games.

Positives:  Plays extremely well with 6 players, a number that only a few games will even play and offers a very full gaming experience in a very short playing time without much complexity.  Ranks right up there with Web of Power in my book.

Caveat:  Try to get a new addition of this game if possible, since some of the older editions' game board graphics are fairly difficult to read and can lead to some player aggravation and errors in placement of markers.

I was let down a bit here.  The quality and design of the board was poor, and the meeples could have been cubes and worked better.  The game itself was a fun bidding game that used victory points as the bid, very intriguing.  Things went a bit slow for my liking.  Then again, we did play with six, so perhaps a lower number is it's best bet.

Really a very solid auction game and I understand why it is still ranked so highly after 15 years.  I like Modern Art more and think it has more interesting elements as a pure auction game given its closed economy and variety of auctions.  Nevertheless, Medici brings double objectives of ship value and commodity types to the table.  It also has the interesting challenge of creating the size of the auction presents also interesting challenges.  

UPDATE: Dropping the rating somewhat, as while I do think it's a good auction game, there are better ones out there.  I just don't think I would seek out table time for this one, except that it does play 6.

Played for the first time again six years after my first play. Played with six now, opposed to with three then. Liked it a lot more with six, and I can see how this is even better with five. Of all Knizia auction games, this one definitely is the most mathy one. Players could go out at lengths to calculate the exact value of each offer to each player, and bid accordingly, bringing the game to a grinding halt.
But if you just leave the maths aside and bid from the gut, Medici is a pleasurable experience. Ra remains my favourite with 3 or 4, but with 5 or six players, Medici may end up becoming my favourite auction game.

I have both RA and Medici on iOS.  Medici was more intuitive, so I picked up this hardcopy. The Grail games version is beautiful!

I like auction/bidding games; so this will probably stay in my collection as a quintessential game.

I like Medici's simplicity, as well as the balancing mechanics.  Reveal, bid, buy, add the numbers, score for area control.  Repeat.  I do wish that there was one more element in the game for complexity, and as a result, this game is not likely to hit the table as often, because it requires the right group to play.  However, it is very approachable for non-gamers, which makes it ideal for family game nights.

Given that we have other games that use an auction mechanism with a larger context, having a game that is purely auction was not in our best interest.

[many plays] It takes a decent amount plays to get a real good feel for this game.  Any auction game like this takes a few plays to really learn the values of things.  What I like about this game though, it plays in about an hour.  It supports 4-6 players well.  It is an intense game where the luck balances out well.  It is kind a rare game that is able to play 6 players and finish within an hour and provide an intense exciting finish.  The con of this game is that that auction is the only thing.  That is all there is it is just a big auction.  Which can be fun and exciting yes, but does seem to hurt the replay value of the game a little bit.

Fun auction game. It's heavy enough to get the old grey matter going, but light and quick enough to fill an end of night slot. Every turn is tense, which is great.

One criticism is that the components, while pretty, aren't the most well designed for in-game readability. It's the only board I've seen which causes people to have a mysterious inability to count in 5's and 10's.

Set collection auction game set in Renaissance Italy. The game follows a number of auction where the active player reveals between one to three tiles, each depicting a type of good and a numeric value. Players then bid victory points to acquire the tiles (they begin the game with thirty). Once all the tiles have been auctioned scoring takes place, points awarded for having the highest numeric totals from the tiles and how far the goods have progressed the player along the corresponding goods' tracks. This is a simple game with the clever mechanism of having to sacrifice points in order to acquire them, and success depends on how efficiently this can be achieved. The theme however is completely tagged on giving the impression that the gameplay could have been applied to virtually any subject designer Reiner Knizia decided to choose (Renaissance period Italy always seems to do well in this regard).

A once-around lot-bidding system of a fast paced game.  Allows up to 6 people to play, another plus.  Acquiring the most goods of the same type overall and the boat with the highest amount of quality goods are the two best ways to win, keeping an eye on getting goods to your boat cheaply which rounds out the strategy of this game.  Easy to set up, easy and fast to play (only 3 turns, each about 10-15 minutes in length), and accomodation for half a dozen people to play makes this a good alternative if you are short on time or have brain overload for the evening.

tl;dr: solid classic style auction game

Yes, believe it or not, I had never played this game before!
I know it's hard, but try to remember that time when there was a designer called [person=2][/person], and he was putting out classic after classic. Every new game with his name on it that was announced instantly went on any Euro gamer's radar. Man, that time is long gone, and sometimes I long for it. Just goes to show: I'm getting old.
So Medici was first put out at the height of his career. And it shows. This has everything a classic Reiner has: simple rules, well oiled play, nice depth of choices to make. Today he does the same except he develops his games to death so all fun is gone. I did find this game a bit long with 6, but the competition is very tight, and the auctions pretty tense. It made me remember why we used to love Reiner's designs.

I struggle a little to rate this as I did so badly in my one play it's hard to not let that cloud my opinion of the game.

It seemed to be a pretty simple auction game with a couple of decent decisions to be made. Unfortunately as the game progresses, different goods have very different relative values to each player and so it becomes all too easy with a few lucky tile draws to get a perfect set of tiles for 3 or fewer coins.

So; moderately luck heavy, but pretty fast to play with some difficult decisions and a few very straight forward decisions means that this is a decent, but far from spectacular game.

Only comes out with 6 players around looking for an auction game and we don't have time for Powergrid, so sorta limited play time I guess.  Moved this down to a 6, just isn't something I bring out often at all.

I like Medici just fine.  Great game, and I'd rather play this than Modern Art.  But it is eclipsed by Ra and Traumfabrik in my opinion.  I wish I had the newer RGG edition just to get rid of the bad art/cards.  That would probably make my rating go up, simply because the game would be more playable, and easier to teach, and for others to catch on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Most of the auction games I've played are hard to play at first because you don't know the value of what you're buying. Medici is very easy to pick up and play for first-timers and still has some depth for seasoned veterans. This is a game sometimes more about playing the players rather than playing the game. I highly recommend it at 5-6 players. This is probably my go-to at that count.

One of the few games I actively hate.  Too often, a bundle of goods will be drawn that is great for one player (eg worth 20-30 points) and mediocre for the rest (eg worth 5-15 points);  no one is willing or able to outbid the player for whom it is great.  If you don't wind up getting one of these bundles, you will not be compensated in future rounds.

RATING: 8
The open-ended valuation of each auction reminds me of Modern Art. This is both a feature and a bug. It's not as dramatic as in Modern Art, but players in Medici can still bid themselves into oblivion unless they understand how to properly evaluate each batch. Do not expect to play this game well on your first go; in fact, assume you'll play poorly, especially in the first round. By the end of the game, you'll realize where you went wrong, and hopefully understand why you failed to bid high (or low) enough throughout the game.

Otherwise, I find this an intriguing game. The once-around auctions will be a love or hate type of feature. I love them, as they add tension and strategy based on player position. The freedom to bid as much as you like adds fragility, which will make repeat plays all the more enjoyable as players gain skill. I hope it lives up to my expectation after one play, and I look forward to playing again. This may be my favorite of the major Knizia auction games, as a perfect blend somewhere between Modern Art and Ra.*

As a final note, the graphic design and user interface are absolutely horrendous. Did the designer actually play the game?! Someone must have a better PnP option.


* I enjoy Modern Art and Ra, just not as much as Medici. I did not care for Dream Factory, and I have yet to play High Society.

RATING: 6
Medici is a very solid bidding game.  Although it's quite mathematical, it's still a lot of fun.  Every lot has a different value to different players, and once-around bidding of victory points leads to quite a bit of heavy thinking.  It's also good with six, which is a bonus.

RATING: 10
Great game for six players.  Clean mechanics make this a favorite among people in my game group.  I have both editions of the game and we all agree that the board of original Amigo version is easier to read.  Also the Amigo version has "normal" size cards which are easier to shuffle.  The only thing about the Rio Grande version I prefer is the scoring track.  But if your only option is the Rio Grande version, get it anyway.  It's still a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
No frills, no bells, no whistles. A stripped-down game engine that is about as elegant, playable and challenging as it gets. This was an all-time favorite for many years, but of late has been somewhat eclipsed by Strozzi, which shares the same basic mechanics but give players a tad more to consider and weigh. I still enjoy Medici and will play from time to time, but Strozzi has replaced it in my pantheon of elite games.

New Rio Grande version. Some people just find it too difficult to assign values to each lot or card, so there is definitely a ramp-up period for this. I think this is one of Knizia's best auction games due to its simplicity, but I dock my rating a couple of points due to its non-accessibility to first timers, which is often what I have at a game night.

RATING: 7
Medici is a clean auction puzzler that avoids the resouce-conversion antics that have contaminated the genre since.  Money = points and you use the same money to bid with, that you win in the auctions.  There are only a few set collection kickers to complicate things.  Medici is very straightforward and very pleasing.

I love Knizia and I love auction games, but this just fell flat with me.  It seemed like the players had far too little control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game offers a lot of juicy choices: how many cards to add to the auction lot, whether to concentrate on ship value or goods control, whether to risk a bid on a lot you don&#039;t want or to risk letting the opponent to your left get it cheap, whether to hold off on bidding in hopes of getting a real steal at the end. The only reason I don&#039;t rate this an 8 is because the theme is a little dry; the board a little hard to read; and because as the once around bidding makes table position crucial,  if bad cards keep coming up when you have position advantage, you might not get the bargains other players get. The last is not really a flaw, but  a mechanic that can lead to frustration. Also, there is a small element of card counting, but you just need to make sure you look around the table to see what cards have been bought already.

Another Knizia auction game.  Like Ra this one is more of a 'pure auction' game with little to no board play outside of the auctions [unlike say Amun-Re where board placement and player interaction have consequences].  I feel you have less control than in Ra so it feels more random to me.

Fun auction game that used to come out frequently when we needed a game for six.  A bit of push your luck as you try to decide whether to auction one, two or three tiles.

RATING: 6
Nifty auction game.  It just pales in comparison to Ra and Modern Art.  In Ra, the variable(sometimes wildly) number of tiles in a round, and the manipulation of Modern Art make them special.  Medici just seems to be lacking that unique flavor that the others have.  Its a fine game, its just the same designer has outdone himself in a few other pure auction games.

(1 play) My gaming group loves it, so I'm surprised it's taken this long for me to play it. Very nice auction system for 2 independent dimensions of points. Like Evo, bidding with the victory points means you'd better have a good assessment of cost/benefit ratios. Likely to be better with more players, or luck gets more important.

It just didn't grab me.  I did alright in the game - I went for a couple of pillars and led them but never won the boat comparison (actually, I don't think I ever got any points there).  Those 30 points I wasn't getting killed me.  I think next time I'd just go for a high boat total and let the goods fall where they may, and that doesn't really strike me as interesting.

I consider this game to be brilliant.  The mechanism for adding goods to boats and then bidding on them is elegant and involved more thought than is first apparent.  The battle for good majority throws in an element that forces a re-evaluation of goods true worth, which will vary from player to player.  This is an auction game in the truest sense.  Which is why I do so poorly at it.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46/medici]Medici[/url] is an auction game where the players represent merchants vying for the best goods in the market to fill his ship.

The auction happen for lot of 1, 2 or 3 goods. The goods came in five different types: grains, dyes, fur, spices and cloth) and have number from 0 to 5.

The numbers in the goods serve to see, after the day (full round), which merchant has the most value ship. This is worth money (that varies accordingly to the number of players). The type of good shows in which category the player will rise: for each good of the type, the player climbs one spot in that good row. The player(s) in the top position in each type of good receive 10 money, the second, gets 5. Also, if the player reaches one of the top three spots of each row, he will get bonus: 5, 10 or 20 money - higher = bigger bonus. You can see this is a Knizia's game!

The objetic, of course, is to be the merchant with the most money in the end. Since the game doesn't use tokens for money, the sense of "no, I'm losing points in each bid!" is present and is part of the fun.

The player in turn can take, from the bag, one, two or three goods - one at a time. He can start the auction with one or two, but if he take out the third good, an auction [u]must[/u] happen. The players bid in clockwise order. The winner takes all the goods auctioned and put in his ship. The ship has space for 5 goods - the player cannot bid in a lot that has more goods than the spaces still empty in the ship. The rounds ends when there is only one player with room in the ship for goods - if there is still goods in the bag, this last player can take out up to three goods (depending on how much empty spaces there are in the ship) and can take them for free.

After the end of the round, the players compare the goods in the ships to see the most valuable ones. Then the players climb in the row of the goods they purchase and take the points if in first or second in the row.

Repeat this for two more rounds and the game is done!

All in all, a great auction game - at first we didn't know the value of things, but by the second day (round) the bids became more fierce and the type of good and the position of the players in the rows, start to matter a lot. That 20 bonus money for reaching the topmost position in a row of one of the goods is huge! The game normally lasts around the announced 45 minutes, as the clever single bid for each player takes away the long auctions, with players  over-analysing an increasing the bid by $1 several times.

Is [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46/medici]Medici[/url] better than [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12/ra]Ra[/url] or [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118/modern-art]Modern Art[/url]? Yes and no. No for [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12/ra]Ra[/url], as the auction in [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12/ra]Ra[/url] is a thing of beauty. And yes for [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118/modern-art]Modern Art[/url], because in spite of the many types of auctions in [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118/modern-art]Modern Art[/url], which make the plays always feel fresh, [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46/medici]Medici[/url] is better, being faster, tenser and more balanced, as the money go to no other player, meaning an overbid isn't twice bad.

Yet, while I [b]love[/b] [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12/ra]Ra[/url], I just [b]like[/b] [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46/medici]Medici[/url], but it is a good deal of like - and with each play, it grows in my preferences.

Interesting auction game that balances immediate value against long term planning.  Auctioning is really restrictive and leads to tense moments.  Playing "world police" in this game is dangerous, but necessary.  Everyone will avoid the "world police" role and leave it to the last one that is able to fulfill that role.  I think that is the games biggest drawback.

Medici ist relativ kurzweilig, man kann es locker innerhalb von einer Stunde spielen. Am Anfang kann man ziemlich leicht einschätzen, was die Versteigerung gerade für einen selbst wert ist, in späteren runden kann man es dann sehr leicht berechnen, gegen Ende des Spiels gehört schon etwas mehr Rechnerei hinzu. Gerade die Tatsache, dass man mit Siegpunkten bezahlt, führt dazu, dass man schon sehr genau rechnen sollte. Aus dem Bauch heraus - Spieler werden sicherlich ihren Spass an dem Spiel, aber wenig siegchancen haben. Ein paar Mitspieler haben sich sehr an Modern Art erinnert gefühlt, dieses Spiel habe ich leider noch nicht gespielt. Schade finde ich, dass es keine wirkliche Versteigerung ist, sondern jeder nur ein Gebot hat. Aber gerade dies bringt dennoch einen gewissen Reiz hinein, da man abschätzen muss, was eine Auktion einem selbst wert ist, was sie anderen Wert sein könnte, und wenn man nur versucht den Preis in die Höhe zu treiben, kann man sich sehr schnell selbst in Bredouille bringen. Mir hat es gefallen, für einen netten geselligen Spieleabend mit Wenigspielern würde ich es jedoch eher nicht empfehlen, sondern eher Leuten, die Knizia Spiele kennen und mögen. Der ganz besondere Reiz fehlt mir bei Medici. Es ist einfach ein Versteigerungsspiel. Aber ein gutes.

Another Knizia gem. Light and fun auction game with enough twists to make it competitive. Plays decent with three but probably better with more.

9/20/08 This game is simply but the auction mechanic is really one of Knizia's best. After playing numerous auction-based games, this is still one of my favorites. Played with 5 and I love it. A little chaotic, but still able to plot some strategies.

Love the mechanism that you auction your victory points.  And each "container" has two values- one for the point total, one for the product total.  My only beef is that sometimes the "cheapskate strategy" of not bidding on anything and taking what is left over dirt cheap can win the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think this has the potential to be a really interesting bidding game, but each group that I've taught it to has been lukewarm about it.

UPDATE: Wow, I haven't updated that comment in a while, because Medici has become one of my favorite games, possibly ever. It's a perfect blend of strategy to luck, and plays up to 6p with alacrity. The only draw-back is that it's much more nakedly arithmetical than Knizia's other two auction games, but for all that I like it a ton.

RATING: 8
I just played my first game of this, and I definitely liked it.  There are subtleties to this game that are not immediately obvious.  The first one I noticed is that buying a lot of three cards really limits your options and similarly, there are alot of ways to take advantage of other players with nearly full cargo holds.  I'm glad we were all new to the game, since an experienced player would have wiped the floor with us.  Clearly there are additional aspects to the game that 5 newbies didn't pick up on, and I am betting that these will only make the game better.

Part of the "Knizia Auction Trilogy". Bid points for lots of valuable goods, collect sets, and attempt to corner the market in some of those goods to gain bonuses. Solid and simple auction game that provides interesting decisions. I'll however echo other complaints about the components: lot tiles and board towers are difficult to distinguish - bolder colors would have added a lot of ease to game play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very clever bidding game, demonstrated by the fact that there are no hidden cards or counters - absolutely everything is out in the open for all to see.  Somehow it still doesn't grab me as much as Modern Art or Ra, despite being cleverer and more elegant than either, but the more I play it the more I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Very simple mechanics, great interactive style.  My one gripe would be the components, as the money-bag-eeples are too big for where they must be played, making their location easy to mistake.  The tiles and boat cards look good, though.  The auction mechanic and the great playability with 6 mean this one would fill a gap in my collection.

This was fun, the way a big bowl of candy corn is fun. You'll enjoy it, but when it is over you feel a little sick. It is not the game mechanics that turns your stomach. The game is nice enough. Rather, the churn is from the graphics. This thing must have been made by an art school dropout on meth. You can get dizzy lookig at the alternating color scoring track and the cards require scrutiny to determine rank. I am torn-- if the game were beautiful I'd give it a 6 or 7. As it is I don't even think I'll buy it.

Surprising amount of teeth, particularly for such a short game.  This one can get pretty nasty.  It's one of the best extremely simple Euros that were in vogue in the 90s, though.  Rules can be explained in 5 minutes, and game plays as quickly as 30 minutes.  Slightly better with higher player counts, even though game time gets longer.  More people keep the competition for resources a little stronger, and de-emphasize the bonus for card value., making the game a bit more intuitive and less swingy.

(Feb '09) After 2 4p games, I like it so far and as with most auction games it will grow on me as I play more.  I usually like Knizia games and was surprised I didn't like this one more after hearing so much good stuff about it.  As a result I would like to try it with 5 and 6 when fewer tiles are removed (or none) to give it a fair shot.  I will greatly prefer to play it with people who play at a quicker pace and I might not play if I know the player will make every calculation for every player on every auction at a slow pace while staring into space.  I guess I like games played quicker.  Overcome a calculation that you missed.

RATING: 8
The textbook definition of elegance- as usual Reiner makes an interesting, tense and fun game out of very simple rules. Comparing this to RA, they both have a push-your-luck element where you have to decide how much you're willing to pay for what's available now, in light of the fact that something (better? worse?) might come up later. In Medici you can bid any amount, as opposed to RA where your sun tiles determine the bids available to you. I think this constraint in RA makes it more accessible, but I personally like the open-ended bidding of Medici more. That being said, RA is much better with 3 players and Medici rules with 5. Only at 4 is there really competition between these games. I recommend owning both, personally.

RATING: 7
I HATE THIS GAME.  No matter how often I play it, I can never figure out how to valuate a given set of cards.  It's worth x to me, y to you, z to that person over there, q to her, d to him ... GRARGH.  Every time I think I've made the perfect bid on something, I either hear cries of "THAT much??", or the next person jumps on it for a seeming bargain.

I LOVE THIS GAME.  I think it's cool how the ruleset is just a ruleset, and that the game itself lies in the decisions that players make during the course of the game.  The once-around bid is awesome, and forces players to decide immediately how valuable a particular set of cards is to everyone, and based on what other players have chosen, the value maybe vastly different to everyone.  It's very Sackson-esque, both in its simplicity of rules and complexity of scoring.

Really interesting and fun game that combines auctions with push-your-luck card draws. I would far rather play this than Modern Art, and would likely hold it up as the best "entry level" auction game I've ever played.

I've heard this described as an archetypal auction game, and I can certainly see that. I didn't like the specialization, because it seems that by the end of the game there were lots that were only good for a player or maybe 2, and in a multiplayer game, there's only so much you're willing to spend to take one for the team to prevent someone from having something. Compared to, say, Ra, there weren't enough times where lots were good for everyone but great for one person; rather, it seemed often that lots were great for one person, OK for one other and either awful or unavailable for the other 4. It's a good game, but I can't see myself wanting to play it over things like Ra or For Sale.

Usual Knizia pasted on theme can't disguise this as just moving coloured number cards around.

This game took about 20 iterations to lose it's luster!
The 9 star rating is based on the first 10 matches, which is plenty of play for a game purchase to be worth it.

This is THE bidding game.  It is pure and simple and fantastic.  

Even now, I have much fondness for the game, though I'm not pulling it out much anymore.  After 20+ games, I'd still give it a "if i'm in the mood" (6).  

The new art was a HUGE upgrade as well.  
If you are color blind, the game might be challenging, since color is a huge part of the game.

One of Knizia's auction games, but I feel Ra is definitely better.  I played the 2006 Rio Grande Second Edition and had troubles distinguishing a few of the colors since they looked pretty faded.  There ARE icons on the board, but it's possible for them to be covered with player pieces.  Speaking of the player pieces, they are just a little too big for the tracks on the board.  Really, the tracks on the board, and thus the board overall, should be a bit bigger.  Bidding with victory points makes it an interesting decision every time there's a good "hand" of tiles available, but also means if someone gets far behind, there's no way for them to really catch up as the leader has a lot more currency to work with.

A nice game. The bidding mechanic is much more controlled than Medici vs Strozzi (i.e. you cannot take loans and end up below 0 points). Feels a little too random though and if one person gains an early lead it can be hard to stop them. May be I need to approach it with a more strategic mind though.

Auction game mechanic is simple and easy to teach, but creates much tension. There is therefore very high player interaction with little downtime. Even if a player is already out of a day's remaining auctions (hold completely filled), that player will remain interested in observing the rest of the auctions. There is a small but not insignificant amount of luck for the player who starts filling up his/her hold last, which can be rather irritating.

The game does not work well with smaller player counts. With fewer players, one does not get as much opportunity to wait for a particular type of commodity to turn up. With a number of commodity cards removed, the game is also more random. The importance of turn order and how it affects the auctions is also downplayed with fewer players. Scalability is therefore on the low side and it really needs a greater number of players to be fun.

Game board design of the older editions leaves much to be desired, though the game components are quite nice. The latest edition resolves most of these issues.

An interesting push your luck/bidding/investment game from RK. The game fosters disagreements about the best use of turns, actions and bidding strength, which I think was a healthy discussion and showed that the game actions were not as obvious as I first thought they were. Overall, I wasn't that impressed, but I think the dynamic with more people would be more interesting -- so I'd try it again with 4 or 5.

There's a good amount of luck in the draws in this one, but it plays fast and has some nice tactical play.

My one complaint is that I have the Rio Grande version that has the *worst* graphic redesign that I've ever witnessed.  There is no color coordination to tie the goods pyramids to the related goods cards.  You have to identify the pyramid by the pictures, which is not as easy as it sounds.  Also the writing on the cards is surprisingly hard to read. Finally, they skip every other number along the scoring track in a way that makes it very awkward to keep score.

By comparison, the original Amigo version has a clearer scoring track and easy to match-up goods pyramids.  Sigh...

A classic Knizia auction game where you need to balance the immediate income of collecting the highest value cards with the long term income of collecting many of the same suit of cards.  Interestingly this had a very Coloretto-like feel to me, particularly in the later parts of a round where few people have room on their boats and its possible to push your luck a bit cheaply with the deck to find what you're looking for.  I'm looking forward to playing more to see what sort of bidding strategies develop!

This is often our "warm up game" before we break into a game that is a little more in depth.  It's fun and easy to learn, but because you bid against other players and use your points to do so it makes the game very fun to play!

Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a big fan of auctions, so for Medici to not completely turn me off definitely speaks volume of its quality.  The once around bidding is brilliant by reducing the downtime and keeping the game from dragging.  It is true that the ability to count cards to get an idea of what's left in the deck does take some of the tension away, but not excessively so to rob you of the difficult choice between setting someone up to take him out of the auction or grabbing the set for yourself.

A very good experience for six players and I definitely would not mind exploring this further.  I look forward to revisiting Medici again.

This little gem really surprised me.  So simple, yet so engrossing.  I like the fact that you have control over how many lots you're putting up for auction, giving it a "press your luck" kind of feel (do you turn over one more card in hopes for some gold?).  Plus, there's some sly tactical stuff going on that doesn't exist in auction games (example: turning over three lots to auction off to close others out of bidding, etc.)

Great bidding game.  I like playing with 6 as I don't like the game with cards missing from the deck.  I like the bidding mechanic and the card drawing system.  This is a great game to use to introduce new gamers to the world of boardgaming.  German version has better graphics.

Interesting auction game which I'd like to play again and see if I can get better at it.

Interesting competition between the players, and against themselves as they swill their currency to get more.  Good challenge!  The lack of clear labeling on the board looks cool to a passerby, but is rubbish for play, however.  The budgeting choices as you bid on the one-time-around auctions carry some interesting subtleties with them, which lend a lot to this game.

Gaming purity.  Start with victory points... to wager bid using victory points... for the chance to make more victory points... lather, rinse, repeat.

The best and most streamlined auction game I've ever played.  The only problem is for it to work right you really need six players.  Also, you can win simply by getting ridiculously lucky which is not a good trait for a Euro.  If that flaw didn't exist, this game would probably be up at a 9.5 or even a 10.

Meh, another knizia auction.... medici, modern art, amun-re, hollywood blockbuster... do we really need all of them?? I have the feeling I am playing the exact same game on every single one of them... I don't dislike auctions provided they are PART of the game (like in power grid), and not the GAME ITSELF (in all of the above)

Sajnos alapvetően nem jönnek be a csak licitálást használó játékok, így talán nem meglepő módon ez sem lett a szívem csücske.

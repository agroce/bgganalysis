Superfast bluffing/evil game.  Only question is whether there is anything actually to it.

Latest play and I really didn't think much to it.

Played 3 more games tonight. If you can call them games. 
I think I'd rather play almost anything else.

RATING: 6
Fun but there's this uncomfortable, dry side to it: too many games are resolved by doing the math and deciding whether to call out a person... the problem being the math always confirms your chance of winning/losing at about 50-50. Which is suspiciously close to one other activity... flipping a coin.

An excellent, quick bluffing game for groups too small, or with a dislike for, the Resistance. Although it can suffer from a slight problem with kingmaking, it is still a worthy addition to any collection.

I want more. And I am most certain that the more games I get to play, the higher the score will go. 

first update: 10 games so far, taught it to 4 people now. It is so accessible and easy to grasp. Not sure the last person I taught it got a hold of the strategy, but we had 4 fun games. Love it.

Do not recommend 2 player, not fun.

This to me is one of the BEST social deduction and bluffing games out there.  I think what makes it work is that you can call someone out on their lies, but there are penalties if you're wrong.  It makes the distrust tense and wonderful.

Sweet game that feels like reverse Love Letter meets Poker.  The brevity and banter allows this game to hit the table a lot.  Only problem is if you have a group that doesn't lie.  The game isn't interesting when players are just racing to get money in order to coup.

Pain to teach as the interaction of the rules can be a little hard to understand conceptually.

The accusation/bluffing elements of The Resistance/Avalon combined with the quick-playing, elimination aspects of Love Letter. This would be a good game for the right group, but it really needs a group of people familiar enough with each other to lie, betray, and throw wild accusations around without worrying about bullying, hurting feelings etc. It's a neat little design.

RATING: 6
Bluffing and outguessing your opponents is just fun. Coup also has inbuilt mechanisms that inevitably force the game to the end quite quickly which is good for games of this category. Player elimination is not a problem either, since that's sole purpose of the game and hence everyone's fine with it. I would gladly play Coup again to fill that 10-15min slot you have.

If I am to give some criticism, would that go for the cheesy and unimaginative art. Furthermore, I am a bit concerned about the longevity of the game. On the other hand it is a good thing to have a very limiten number of characters. On the other hand, a few extra ones could have added to the life span. In additioin, Coup is not a game you would go raving about. It is fun but a bit unrewarding in the long run.

A nice fast little game that we played multiple times at lunch.  Seven games in a row.  All quick.  All cutthroat.  I like the back-stabbery that goes on.

Sadly, I did not win.  But I was quite good at countering any challenges against me.  And I challenged or blocked a few others.  My downfall was usually trying to use my assassination or steal abilities - because even though I had them, the other players always had the abilities to counter them.

Haha!  Played three games in a row and won two of them!  My persistence has paid off!  This time I paid close attention to who could block abilities.  And the last game I was at one card the entire game (lost it in the first round) but still managed to pull through to a win!  Take that!

Now, among my group of friends at lunch, I'm considered quite a threat in this game, and they usually attempt to knock me out early - not that they succeed, but it's cute how they try.

It's an okay game. It's a bluffing game, but I find that you need the right mix of players (mainly those that are willing to take chances and don't play very conservatively). I also find the coup thing so unbalanced. I know it's there to force the game along, but it really emphasizes the leader-bashing because you need to either stop the coup or take down the leader when you get the coup. Of course, I'm not that good at the game, so maybe my rating is a reflection of that.

Ace game, that I've played with a number of people not usually into card games and has always been enjoyed. Rather than getting stale quickly, multiple plays with people ends up with double-bluffs, then triple, then quadruple... Knowing your enemy opens up the game more rather than closing it down!

2-player can get a bit dull, but a number of online variants can add a bit of spice

The strengths of this game are why I don't like it.  The first half is kind of interesting - trying to figure out if someone is bluffing, trying to weed out the pack.  The second half is awful - it boils down to a degenerate affair of who has the right card(s) and who's got initiative.  It's quick and ends fast, but why should I play it?  Not entirely without merit, but far enough gone that I'm not going to play it.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

It's a small box with no game inside. I understand it's supposed to be a filler bluffing game, but I'm sure there're much better games in this genre.  The artwork is good, I'll give it that, but the game is really non existing. It feels pointless and flimsy.

Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, but I really hated this game.

A party game that is much weaker in gameplay than werewolf.

The 'power' of these cards are interesting and in a way drives the game, where players do their guess work and take that chance.

It's really only a matter of time that you will make the 'attack' accusation, as the cards are running out. In the end, it's usually the one that outlast everyone, not because he was good, but it was the others that was bad. It could just be pure luck that by the time it was your turn, the obvious was already at hand. With such minimal cards left,is there really a joy in making that guess?

Much like playing a guessing game that eventually comes down to a 50-50 chance. Might as well begin with that. It would have been a faster game then.

All is not lost, if your group of friends are new gamers and felt there was a strategy in hiding their card's identity, as being fun.

Can't share the joy from a old timer wargamer.

You get hidden character powers and try to eliminate other characters via coup, assassination, or calling other players' bluffs (about what character powers they have). Both bluffing and player elimination need to be done particularly well for me to like either mechanic. In this instance, I'm fairly ambivalent towards it--but it has been growing on me some over time.

- Bluffing is hilarious along with telling the truth and getting called out

I adore the idea behind Coup, but somehow it fails to come alive for me.

I think the problem is that even when you win, you still only get like 4-5 moves in the whole game. You're liable to get no more than 1 or 2. I feel like the game is built to be fast, to deal with the problem of player elimination. But that means that it's too fast, overall, to really have time to build the tension and caliber of bluffing.

I want a bigger, better Coup. I'm not sure what game that is.

A simple card game with a great bluffing mechanic. I really like that it can be played with fewer players (as opposed to "The Resistance" which really shines with 7+ and is also made by Indie). 

Downsides would be that the rule book (pamphlet) could be better written in places for more clarity. I have yet to try out the Reformation expansion but I enjoy the base game enough that I can't wait to try it.

RATING: 6
Coup is a very quick game of bluff with a dusting of deduction.  My reservation is that the endgame, when just two players are left, can be a deterministic anti-climax.

Coup's artwork is quite jolly and production quality is decent.  The rules seem complete.

My issue with Coup is that our large group tends to want to play it. You end up with folks out of the game earlyish waiting around with nothing to do. However, I think this is a fantastic gateway game. Cruicially, I think the expansion for this game is going to be balls-to-the-wall awesome.

A very good example of minimalist game design, let down only very slightly by the lack of variety in the cards - it draws the teeth a little from the truth / lie mechanic and could do with a mild rebalancing.

I do not get the fuss about this game. IMHO it falls into the same category as "Taboo" which means that it is a game for people not able to enjoy other games. One of the worse choices to bring new players to the hobby.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game assuredly breaks the rule against player elimination, but it does so within the context of a very brief game, and an otherwise very enjoyable experiment in human interaction.

  The social aspect of the game, and the possible alliance building possibilities in a 5 or 6 player game give this game the definite ability to please a lot of people and non-gamer partygoers who are willing to sit down and play a short game for the heck of it.  

Once they grasp the card interactions, chances are just about everyone will find something to like in "the experience" of playing at least three hands of this game.

Reminds me a little bit of Nanuk in that this game manages to create a party game out of very little...though this game is MUCH better than Nanuk.

One of my favorite bluffing games. One of the best games in the genre, easy to learn and a great filler game. Appeals widely to the masses yet has a great amount of depth to it. I wouldn't play it more than 4 or 5 rounds; after that it gets a LITTLE bit repetitive, but still an exceptional game, and also very cheap. One of my must haves

RATING: 6.75
Coup is a good example of a game with an elimination mechanic, that is still totally acceptable (cf Bang). The short playtime of each round allows non-harsh elimination. At the same time, King/Queenmakers really kind of ruin this game, and the small amount of cards makes this game somewhat too simplistic for my liking.

Short, compact, easy to learn, and only as hard to master as your cohorts' poker faces are to crack. It's such an easy to travel box and a quick game to explain and play that I find it one of the best 'social game' investments outside of an actual deck of cards. The game is all about bluffing and that fine line between hiding your bluff and convincing someone you are bluffing when you are not.

This is one of my favorite games to play with five or six people. The rounds are quick, and when people really get into it, it's an absolute blast.

I've lost count of the times I've heard friends - and new strangers at conventions - say things like "As the Duke of Duke-ington, I will collect my taxes from you poor fools," only to be countered by someone saying "Ah ha, good sir, but, you see, I am the Duke of Duke-ington, and I do not believe you hold that title!"

It's fun. You should play it. The rules take some explaining, but any questions are usually cleared up by the end of the first round.

RATING: 10
A great hidden role, bluffing game that works well in any size group with both gamers and non-gamers. While in most hidden role games, you are forced to play as the character you are dealt whether you like it or not, in this game, it doesn't even matter what you are dealt because you can play as whatever you want. The game is as interesting as you choose to make it. You choose how risky you want to play and you create the tension.

Easy to teach with simple rules; has player elimination but plays fast.

Very casual role deduction game that is a lot of fun.  Do you bluff and try to take the action of a different role card and risk getting caught or do you stick with your role and hope someone calls a bluff on you making them lose one of their roles?  This is a last person standing game and very fun.

part of my love of this game stems from the fact that you have a bit of control over every other players turn. you don't just wait for your own turn; you also have chances to bluff in response, or call other players out on their bluffs. one of my very favorite games! like five way rock-paper-scissors BS...super well balances and elegantly streamlined game that you can intro to new players and enjoy with seasoned veterans alike

Excellent quick game to break out and play between bigger games. Can usually go from the start of rules explanation to the end of game 1 in 20 minutesish.

+Very social Bluffing/Deduction game, the mechanic that gives everyone access to all special powers regardless of actual identity is great. 
+Very tense decisions whether you are the one bluffing or debating whether to call someone else out (since false accusations are so punished)
- Player elimination which can turn people off (like the roommate)
- Can sometimes feel inevitable and unexciting when you are down to two players and someone is boxed in with no true way to win

Interesting bluffing game. There's a little too much luck, made worse by a hand size of only 2. The variant where you need 10 coins for a coup, and you hold 3 cards in your hand, seems like it would make it more likely for the better player to win (which is better than the worse player winning). It's very hard to get the information you need to make informed decisions on whether your opponent is bluffing. I'm not sure, that may increase the luck factor.

Personally I'm more of a fan of The Resistance, which is set in this same world, but Coup is a fast, tight bluffing game variant where you are dealt a number of roles and try to remove influence from the other players by bluffing, challenging or denying actions. Scratches a similar itch but there's honestly not a lot to it.

Great for all kinds of players, loaded with intrigue, back stabbing, vicious cut throat play but over in moments so no bad blood.

Fast, super portable, easy to each, set up, great art/universe creation, fun bluffing game with the expansion supports up to 10 players.

Social/bluffing game that engages even non social players as cards detailing the roles/actions (or claimed roles/actions) allows for gameplay to run smoothly and support social interaction.

Really removes a lot of the barriers or pitfalls for other social games like werewolf and needs less table management, making it way more fun in my opinion.

Little card game, just 15 cards.
Each player has a influence of 2 cards. Through actions, bluffing, challenges and blocking other players you try to be the last player remaining with influence.

The possible actions:

1 - receive 1 coin - no blocking possible.
2 - receive 2 coins - can be blocked by any player that has (or claims to have) a Duke.
3 - coup - pay 7 coins and make a player discard face up a influence card. If that player now has 2 cards face up they are out of the game. - no blocking possible.

Character actions (all can be challenged, some can be blocked) -

The challenge comes before blocking, but blocking can also be challenged. 

1 Duke - receive 3 coins - anyone can challenge this player to prevent him taking the action (if they think that that player is bluffing).
2 Assassin - pay 3 coins to make a player lose (discard face up) a card. Can be challenged, after a possible challenge the defending player can block claiming they have the Contessa - this can also be challenged.
3 Captain - steals 2 coins from any player - plays like the Assassin but this time can be blocked by a Captain or Embassador.
4 Embassador - draws 2 cards and adds them to his 2 or 1 (if already lost a influence) and chooses 2 to discard. This can be challenged but not blocked.
5 - Contessa - doesn't do anything, her only purpose is to defend against the Assassin - blocking him. A defending player that claims to have the Contessa can also be challenged.

A challenge goes like this:

The challenged player proves (reveal the card) he has the card he claims to have, if he does have then the challenger loses a influence, and you carry out your action (and shuffle the challenged card back in the deck and draw a new one), if the challenged player doesn't have the card he loses an influence (reveal one of your 2 cards), and the action associated with that character is canceled.

Good card game, it needs at least 4 players and everyone needs to be on board with taking it seriously (which seems to be rare amongst my friends lol) but then again relentlessly playing honest cards and never challenging can be a legitimate strategy.. i guess, just not as fun.

Complots is a 5-10 minutes filler about bluffing.
It's a simple, fun, barebone bluffing game, with no chrome added.

Each players starts with two cards, hidden, which also are its two life points.
On its turn, the player can perform one of eight actions. Three are basic, the others are associated with one of the five characters. One can claim to have any character (cards are hidden) and therefore perform any action. But if the bluff is called and the player doesn't have the character, he must lose one life (discarding one card); if it has the character, the other player loses the life.

It's a clever design, a game made of just a few cards and some tokens, and I definitely look forward to play it again!

Fantastically fun game, the group can make or make this one, its tough for them to break it! and that is saying something! It is possible of course, but nominally speaking you will have fun with this one, more so if you are willing to lie to each other and use each other to further your own agenda, once newbs really get that this is what has to happen, it opens up an entirely new era of gaming before you! Try this one on for size before you buy if none of this seems like fun, but by all means try it, it is an excellent way to spend some time between games or even as an finale or feature depending on the crowd.

Fascinating, raucous fun and probably the best game for the dollar in my collection.

This is the game that made me realise that social deduction games aren't for me. And here's my other beef with Coup: the revolutionary theme appealed to me initially, but then I realised that you're not actually fighting against dictators, but rather fighting to become one. F#%* that. Such an insult to all the brave activists out there, putting it all on the line for freedom against their asshole oppressors. I don't play colonial-themed games for the same reason - it doesn't square with my ethics.

Everyone likes coup, don't they?  Abstract dishonesty; I love it.  Either you are lying, or you are telling the truth while attempting to make it seem like you are lying, or you are lying but trying to make it look so obvious that you are lying, that people assume you must actually be telling the truth and pretending to lie.  When really, that's exactly what you were lying about all along.  Ultimate fun.

I've found Coup usually takes a few games for people to really click on to the tactics required to do well, and because of this I think it's not as good a bluffing game as Skull and Roses, which anyone can pick up after one or two rounds. But it's short and sweet, and it's still a good time and a fun exercise in lying to your friends.

This game has a great concept.  It reminds me of playing B.S. where you can freely lie all you want, and it's not until someone challenges you that you have to prove if you're telling the truth.  The different roles all have their advantages, however I still think there are a couple that are a little weaker.  Of course the brilliance of the game is that it doesn't matter if you have the weaker roles because you can lie and pretend you have the stronger roles.  As you can see your aptitude at this game will directly correlate with your ability to lie convincingly, although a well-placed truth can be just as effective.  It's a quick game, and uses a very limited number of components to create a decent amount of fun.  The only reason I don't love it is that the gameplay requires a group of players that I don't have in my family.  People that enjoy lying as a game mechanism will have the most fun with Coup.

This game gets a 2 score from me for a couple of reasons:
- I really don't seem to like games where you have to be good at bluffing, I get extremely uncomfortable, red in the face and nervous. 
- The theme doesn't grab my attention so I kind of drift off daydreaming instead of immersing myself with the idea of the game, of being in a certain situation for example or playing a roll where bluffing or politics would be exciting, I do for example like The Werewolves of Millers hollow.

My group likes playing this for some light-hearted deception. For whatever reason, it tends to bring out an extremely goofy delight in us all as we become these over-the-top characters exuberantly proclaiming the exploits of "Oooooh, the Double Duke!", flamboyantly blocking a Captain's stealing as... THE CAPTAIN, cooly thwarting assassination attempts with Contessa, and more! Or are those all blatant lies?!?! I generally don't prefer the game to other things since I find it pretty shallow, but it's great fun for turning us into wacky characters. And I do love introducing this to non-gamers and those very new to the hobby. It's always solid fun for a little while. I think my ideal player counts are 4 and 5. Any more and I'd rather be playing Resistance: Avalon or One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

It's a great game involving some elements of skill and some of social deceit. Works best with 4 or more players.

Decent quick party game.

A purely bluffing strategy game.  There are several types of characters.  You have two of them.  Each can take certain actions.  Each player takes turns making actions that they may be able, or not able to do, and it is up to other players to call them out if they think they are bluffing.  There's some other mechanics involved, but that's the primary thrust of the game.

Those times where someone does make a great lie, I love it. I just feel like those moments happen too infrequently. Might depend on the group you play with but thought it was just ok.

RATING: 10
Will forever be one of my go to games. Play is simple, games are fast, gives a wonderful mix of strategy, luck, and social play. 

You can perform a number of actions depending on the role cards you have, but role cards are hidden so you can lie and pretend to be any and all roles. People can call your bluff and then you lose a life, but if you're telling the truth they die instead. 

Coup Reformation is an expansion that I always play with. 

For completely new roles but the same gameplay look at Coup Rebellion G54

2012. A simple, secret roles, deduction and bluffing game.  The goal of the game is to be the last one standing so it has lots of player elimination, which ends up being okay because the game lasts only 10 min.  This game involves more bluffing and less deduction than other games in the same genre--Love Letter, Avalon, The Resistance.  I don't care for the social deduction game genre since I dislike games where bluffing and deceit are primary mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great filler/micro style game, plays quick and with the right group who is willing to lie becomes an interesting adventure and a bundle of fun.  Expandable to play 10+, but haven't tried in a very large group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
Deductiony bluffing game, take actions which can only be done by a particular type of card, mostly to gain or steal money to afford a coup. Cards are face down and you have only 2 cards in your hand out of 5 types in total. Somehow seemed a bit limited. Don't lie and you'll do well, challenging is the fun of the game, but that's how you can lose.

A fast (~20 min) bluffing game that was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Players are assigned two role cards faced down, but can claim they have any role when taking an action associated with a role. The other players can call the bluff. If you lied you loose one of your roles, if you were telling the truth they accuser loses one. Last person standing wins.

RATING: 7
A cross between Love Letter and The Resistance. This is a fun little game. It's very light and airy, but so easy to play and so quick (five minutes for a hand even) that the return on investment is very satisfying. There's a pretty good chance each hand that you'll have some laugh worthy moments mixed in with a few moments in which you have to attack someone without a good reason as to whom. Like Cosmic Encounter, your group has to add a little social energy into the game to get it to sing. For the price and investment, you really can't go wrong if you want to squeeze a diverting social game into a small amount of time; I recommend Coup for that reason. I have played with three and four and now won't play with fewer than four. I have yet to play with The Reformation expansion but I anticipate the very small tweak it offers to give the game that little bit more richness that I feel it needs.

With >4 players the buildup play is nonsense. You get killed or you don't rather randomly. Your starting position in the 3-4 players endgame is also quite random, if you're somehow one of the survivors. You can get some information via ambassador or correct guessing, but the game often ends in a kingmaking 3 player outcome, where a player is forced to make a Coup and killed directly afterwards.

I hope with 2-4 players the game is better, but 5-6 is really bad.

RATING: 7
I can see how this would be a good, perhaps great, game in the right company.  I did not play with those people.  

Fundamentally, the game is uninteresting if everyone tells the truth.  The real game is in determining who is lying.  However, the stakes are a little too high for the person calling the bluff - if you call someone and are wrong, then you lose 1 of 2 cards.  This means that the people I played with were very hesitant to call someone unless it was obvious they were lying.  Everyone was also hesitant to lie, so the game kind of played itself.  And it was boring.

Now, I admit up front that this is more about the players than the game.  However, I do not think these were atypical players.  That is, I think being hesitant to lie and hesitant to call others will be typical, especially for first time players, unless you're talking about a poker group, or a group that is used to bluffing being part of the game.  It is therefore critical for the person teaching the game to stress that this is a game about bluffing.

Fun opener or filler to play while you're waiting for another table to finish up. Once everyone knows how to play it goes super quick.

My only complaint about Coup is that it has a lot of upfront rules explanation. I like my filler games to be more 'teach as you go' than Coup.

The amazing Cockroach Poker does bluffing so well that I struggle to want to play any other short bluffing game.

Also 2 player Coup is pretty terrible and anticlimactic.

I'm going to need to play this one more before laying down a verdict, but I do think it is a solid deception game for a larger group. I didn't have nearly as much fun with this game as I did Avalon or One Night Werewolf, but I was also trapped in a few frustrating, no-win situations. I think this is probably tainting my view of the game. Regardless, it has gotten too much praise for me to not give it more chances. Besides, it does seem right up my alley, as a Werewolf and Avalon lover.

A well-designed, cutthroat bluffing game. It's most interesting with more players, but players can be knocked out early and forced to wait out the rest of the game. Fortunately games go by quickly, so being out early is less of an issue with Coup than with some games.

Excellent filler game; it reminds me of Love Letter with hidden information and bluffing. The interplay between the different powers is well-balanced, and the flow of the game is well-done. It remains to be seen how it plays with a larger group.

My only curiosity is if the game becomes a bit stale, meta-wise, over extended play, but the randomness should help with that.

Ugh, our first couple of plays of this have been a total disaster. You really have to have each role memorized if you want to bluff with them, and none of us seemed to get the hang of it.

I have the absolutely beautiful French "Complots" version, which I love the look of, but I haven't been able to make this work in our play group. We won't give up yet!

Still, this is one of my favorite bluffing games. It's fallen out of favor recently, because newer players have a distinct disadvantage when compared to seasoned players (new players get caught checking the reference cards).

Still, it's easy enough to play, and some of my friends' kids got the game because they liked playing it.

Schrödinger's quick and brutal card game of lying and face stabbery.

Unfortunately, after a while, the same patterns develop and the game starts to feel pretty samey and winning or losing feels out of my control. Win or lose, I don't feel my decisions really mattered all that much.

The Reformation expansion adds few rules, but makes the game a lot thinkier and less arbitrarily cruel.

I think maybe it just occupies too weird of a niche for me. It lacks the nail-biting tension of a full-fledged bluffing game, and also lacks the sheer lighthearted fun factor of a good filler/microgame. There's no real laughs here.

This game just feels... flawed. It's short enough that I enjoy it well enough well playing, I just don't know that I would really suggest it. Firstly, bluffing only really seems viable early game. I like the feel of the risk when you challenge someone early game, but the penalty if you're wrong is just SO harsh. Once you're down to one card, your plays just feel incredibly limited.

The real problem I have with this game, though, is the endgame always feels incredibly anticlimactic. Every game we've played things becomes increasingly deterministic, and the end just boils down to mathing out enough money to win. I'm used to bluffing games like Liar's Dice, or hell, even poker, where the final play is when tensions are at their highest. This feels like the opposite, and that's coming from a group that LOVES bluffing games!

I suspect 4 is the ideal number here. With more hidden information, there's more room to bluff, and it's less likely that one person will spend half the game with only one card while everyone else sits around with both of theirs.

While it’s not a particularly good game per se, I’m not sure about its merits as a filler – it might actually be okay. At least that is my first impression.

Yes, there is a lot of bluffing involved and almost no deduction imo, and yes it’s quite random, but considering it takes 5-10 minutes max to play the game is actually not that bad. Admitted, there isn’t really much to the game – it’s all about the bluffing! And I guess that can be fun sometimes, but it’s not like you feel you played much better or worse than the other players if you win or lose… Though I have to say that there is still room for some clever play/bluffing. 

Coup is almost always compared to Love Letter, and for what it’s worth I think it’s slightly better than Love Letter. In LL you're restricted to your two cards, so the luck of the draw plays a slightly bigger role; yes, you also draw 2 random cards in Coup, but you can lie about which cards you have! This makes Coup a little less random (I think) and more fun because of the bluffing. 

As Coup only takes 5-10 minutes to play I won’t refuse to play it, and I would gladly play it a few times, but I would rather play a filler like No Thanks or For Sale.

Game of bluffing with interacting cards. Very quick. I'm not so keen on having to choose someone to eliminate (and elimination in general) due to a coup with no way for them to counter it. In the games I played, players amassed 7+ coins very quickly which led to mass coups, the winner being the person who was picked on least. More plays needed and perhaps better use of captains.

[b]Includes Coup: Reformation kickstarter edition.[/b]

Coup is a rapid-quick, 15 card game of lying and bluff. The closest example to it that I have is Liar's Dice. But instead of dice values hidden in a cup, you can choose from five different character powers, brazenly taking one of six options whether you have the card or not. You've got two cards. If someone catches you in the act, you have to flip a card up. Lose both, and you're out. It's very fast and efficient.

As far as card fillers go, there are more "thinky" or challenging options. But if you want a game that really distills out the feeling of poker and shameless lying and bluff, then this is a pretty solid option.

Bluffing and social deduction games can be fun, but they aren't my first choice in games since I am horrible at them. This one was pretty easy to pick up as you have 2 roles and 7 options to choose from on your turn. On your turn you take one of the actions and you can potentially call someone's bluff when they take an action. Last one standing wins. I'm happy it plays in 15 minutes because that's about as much fun as I can get out of it before I'm either ready to move on to something else or call it a night. Playing both this and Sheriff of Nottingham in the same week I would rather play this simply due to the playtime but again only if we had a random 15-20 minutes at the start or end of a game night.

Meh... As far as deduction Micro-Games this one is just sort of so, so. You have almost as much fun playing a game of Bullshit with a standard deck. There is very little strategy unless you have six people and then it is so hard to keep track of who had what it becomes silly. Masquerade is a better role/bluffing and Avalon is a better large group deduction game.

This is a bad game. This is a "I choose you to lose" game. That really really sucks. But for some reason or another I don't often turn it down. Its bluffing is interesting, and produces a lot of "oh man, does he have it? Are you going to call that? Oh I dunno I think he's got it," kind of moments. Played it a lot, because it's just so easy to get people into playing it and get them excited to play it more. So it serves that purpose, no matter how terrible it really is.

Really fun bluffing game that is quick to learn and short to play. The theme is thin but it doesn't hinder the fun factor. It is a good game for gamers and non-gamers as it is short and easy to understand. There are five possible roles (cards) while each player has only two....but can claim and perform the action of any of the five roles. Players choose to call their bluff, or not as it may mean losing one of their own cards if the opponent is not bluffing. Full of laughs.

Coup hits most of the sweet spots that I look for in a game of bluff, the most obvious ones being opportunities for bluff-counter bluff plays and build in mechanisms to keep the game from dragging out too much.

Basically you start the game with 2 special powers and a small menu of basic actions that are much worse. On your turn you can take one of the basic actions, or play one of your 2 cards face down, declare what card it is, and take a special action associated with the declared card, of which there are 5. The rub is that you do not have to reveal until someone challenges you, saying that either you are lying, or that they have a particular card that counters yours so you can hypothetically be taking actions for cards you don't have as long as no one calls you out on it. Cards are revealed in challenges, and the lying player who is called out gets punished by losing one of their cards, this applies both to the active player, or the player who challenges (if they are challenging by stating they have one of the cards that counters the one that the active player used). 

This challenge mechanism is central to the game, as losing both cards is how you lose the game. To further push the speed of the game it also has a timer mechanism where you can slowly tick up your money at the rate of at least 1 coin a round, with 7 coins being usable to take 1 card away from a player of your choice. Alternatively, there is also a role that allows you to speed that up considerably, as it only costs 3 coins to do the same thing, but again, is reliant upon having the card or successfully bluffing that you have the card.

This is a bit gamey, as the description might make apparent, but the game actually flows pretty well once you get into it and see how it functions. I would be more than willing to play this readily with an experienced group as filler between games. It is pretty stripped down, but still has some fun room for play within its system.

Briliant. Pure bluff and hesitation. The fact that you shuffle and draw again if you've been accused means no one can ever be quite sure (well, rarely) who you have, so a lot of it is hunches with a nervous eye to the player stockpiling for a Coup...

The game itself I wouldn't rate that high, 6-7 probably. It found that as hidden identity games go in this one it pays to not lie. You usually get some benefit out of who you are, and you should just roll with it, it saves you a chance of being killed of if you're caught with a wrong character.
However it always makes for a time well spend. People always laugh, it's good while waiting for other before starting something bigger, or when you still have time

Nice little filler, which I put in the same category as love letter. Same idea, just implemented a bit differently. Possibly there is more depth to Coup than Love Letter in terms of the various combinations and strategies (and the bluffing element is quite cool) however it can all be over very quickly. 

The expansion adds a lot to the game - and makes it significantly better.

Surprise of all surprises is that the 7yo plays this game really really well. Won his first two games of it! Has played a couple of similar games previously (Avalon, Werewolf) but he absolutely nailed this. An interesting game and it will be interesting to see how long a run it has.

Rájöttem, hogy szeretem az olyan játékokat amikben időnként kifejezetten hazudni kell a többieknek, illetve fel kell tudni ismerni amikor mások épp blöffölnek. A Coup lényege is pont ez. 15 lap, ebből mindenkinél van kettő. Különböző kártyákkal különböző akciókat tudsz végrehajtani (az egyikkel felhúzhatsz és visszatehetsz két kártyát, a másikkal 1-2 pénz helyet 3-at vehetsz fel, a harmadikkal 7 pénz helyett 3-mal tudsz kártyát dobatni, a negyedik blokkolja az ilyen 3-as eldobató akciót, az ötödikkel pedig lopni tudsz 2 pénzt ha a másiknál nincs ugyanilyen lopó vagy kártyacserélő kártya). Egy akcióhoz nem kell a kezedben lenni a kártyának - blöffölheted is, hogy ott van. De ha hazudsz és lebuksz, eldobsz egy kártyát. Ha lebuktatnál mást de kiderül, hogy nem blöffölt, eldobsz egy kártyát. Ha befizetsz 7 pénzt, valakivel eldobatsz egy kártyát.

Aki utoljára marad kártyával a kezében az nyer.

My kids love this game. For me, I much prefer Love Letter as a micro game. Targeting other players seems too wide open. When you have enough money, you can just kill someone. No fanfare. Each player has two "lives", which means that players always target those who have two lives first, then those with one. I want to live it more than I actually do.

Rating falling fast with additional plays. My only future plays will be at the request of my kids. But I'll try to sell them on something like Koryo instead, if possible.

RATING: 8.5
Coup is a quick bluffing card game.  I have only played with 4 and 6 players so far.  Liked it a little better with 4 - with 6 it takes a while to get back to your turn again, and I'd rather play the Resistance :).

Games play in about 20 minutes, so even if you are eliminated, it's not for too long.  Lot's of fun opportunities to bluff, and it's always a good time when someone gets called out, whether they were bluffing or not!  

Also, all of my friends seem to like it better than the Resistance - it is nice to be able to choose whether or not you bluff (as opposed to the Resistance where it is assigned), and there are more options in general in Coup - should I bluff the Duke from the start of the game?  Should I bluff contessa if I am assassinated, or should I call out the other person, or should I just lose a card?  Surprising depth for such a quick (and quick-to-teach) game!

The game get's tired and predictable pretty quickly and if played casually it is particularly frustrating, as an inexperienced player will take out a player who has the potential to kill somebody (motivated by solipsistic fear) rather than attempt to whittle down the people on two lives (which is the correct way to use kill attempts). The game theory is in theory interesting, but quickly falls flat.

Coup feels like another in a long line of recent microgames which have become popular.  It's most reminiscent of Love Letter, but also carries forward the theme of The Resistance.

Coup is essentially a bluffing game where you're trying to outwit your opponent, but it lacks substance.  It makes up for this in a short playtime (or very short if you're doing 2-player).

Thumbs up for good art, portability, and that it's fast.  I just didn't feel like there is much to it beyond that.  Happy to play it if offered, but one I need to own.

At first I had great expectation for this game. In theory all sounded good, even great. Don't know is it my group or game, but I just don't get it. You sometimes lie sometimes you don't. You get caught or not. And that is it. Meh. Too boooring for me and to much like One Night Werewolf.

Changed my rating ffrom 5 to 7. Played it with more than 4 players and the game was just perfect. Much more fun and laughter. Play it with 5 or more, less than that just don't do right to the game.

Quite a fun light bluffing game. The synergy of the five roles is what makes this game interesting: they're all useful, and players will usually feel a need to have access to all of them throughout the game. The near-indispensability of all roles and the quickly changing game state means players' cannot change their roles fast enough to keep up with the needs of the moment, creating a pressure to bluff, which makes the game tense.

Someone once told me, "The Resistance is a deduction game with some bluffing; Coup is a bluffing game with some deduction." This seemed more or less spot-on after a play or two. I'm decent at bluffing inside of systems I'm familiar with, or when lying is basically mandatory due to role-draw or whatnot, but tend to have an honest streak when it's my choice whether to deceive. This makes this game difficult for me - but also really good practice. :)

If it were any longer I'd find the player elimination annoying, but if players don't get too hung up on things it plays quite quickly.

ETA: After a dozen plays or so, I'm finding that games of this are rarely as interesting / dynamic as I'd hope that they would be. There's rarely enough information in the system for deduction to be relevant, and the game seems to reward honesty nearly as much as bluffing. (Or best of all, being honest while seeming like you're bluffing.) Some friends tell me that [gameid=139] is a similar sort of game which has much better dynamics; I'll have to give that a try sometime.

One play, thought it was too random.

Three plays, started to appreciate the various options.  Let's play more!

Ten plays, it rarely comes out any more.  Everyone pretends to be the Duke for the first couple of rounds, and there's not enough information to accuse anyone of bluffing.  Since claiming to be the Duke gives you three coins and it only takes seven to assassinate somebody, the game quickly ends in a hail of knife-blades.

A fun game. I think I am a medium weight or more game player as these lighter games, while clever and engaging, don't have the "oomf" that would get them much past a 7 rating in my books. The conflict in the game was about right for my family who got worked up and angry but clapped and laughed too.

After all the hype this felt like a bit of a let down.
Potentially very dependent on the group you play with. We've had much more fun with Resistance, One night ultimate Werewolf and even Love Letter.
Too often "bluffing, which would have been the most fun thing to do, felt like it wasn't the "best" thing to do.
You can "play it safe" and simply have no fun. Not sure if it's the player's fault or the game's fault when that happens...

Coup is an excellent bluffing game.  I've overplayed this in the past, but whenever I break it out again after a long time I always enjoy it.  The end of each round is a little predictable, but there are some interesting house rules that might rectify this after 35 plays.

The replay value is somewhat limited in the same group, but a game or three of Coup is a great way to get a game night started. It's easy to teach, the strategies are simple to grasp while still having some depth to discover, and each game is fast enough to dull the pain of an early elimination. That said, there's a lot of luck and "gang up on the leader" is the order of the day, so it's welcome will wear out pretty quick with the same group.

Buffing game that is a blast for everyone very quick and easy to learn. Lying is not (always) required although it does take its part in the game therefore if someone is uncomfortable with some random lying, this game could fall short for them.
On the negative side, the base game allows some player consistent targeting (attacking always and only the same player) and with more and more plays there are almost "safe lies" and the game starts to feel flat

RATING: 10
Players represent Italian families during the Renaissance, wielding power and influence.  There are 15 cards in the game, 3 each of the Duke, Captain, Contessa, Assassin and Ambassador.  These five types of cards each grant a special power in the game.  Two of these cards are dealt to each player, face down, and are ideally kept hidden throughout the game.  On a turn, a player chooses an action from a choice of eight, the five special powers above or three common powers.  The trick here is you can bluff - you may be holding the Duke, allowing you to take 3 coins, or you may not - but you can still claim you are taking the Duke's action and take 3 coins.  Any player can challenge your action, and if you're not holding the card allowing that action, you flip the card up - otherwise you reveal and replace it, and the challenger flips one of their cards face up.  If you have both cards flipped up, you're out of the round.  Last one standing wins.  

This is a fun game of bluff and deduction, very similar in pace, size and fun as the recent Love Letter.  Players have to carefully monitor the cash flowing around the table, as a player who reaches 7 coins can call a Coup - an unblockable attack that forces a player to reveal a card.  Games only take 10 minutes, and are a lot of fun.  A little gem.

After a year and hundreds of games, of course it's a 10.  Perfection.

Neat game. It's definitely a lesson in reading people's tells, but not one that comes natural to me. The game probably takes several plays to shine because it takes a while for players to understand the roles well enough to bluff convincingly. Until that point, the gameplay feels a little random/pointless. And sadly, I'm not playing it consistently enough to really do it justice.

Coup is weird. You have a strong negative feedback loop; if you get hit first, you have less stuff to work with. This would seem to make you treat the game as a light take-that affair; who cares if you get knocked out?

On the other hand, the endgame can be super mathy and interesting and complex. The game doesn't seem to hang together for me.

I gather that the skill is coming out of the early part of the game with good stuff to win the math at the end, but the multiplayer chaos seems to make that difficult to impossible. And looking in the forums for the game, a lot of high-level strategy seems to be hanging back so that people don't pick on you, which is super boring in a game this simple. I don't get it.

I find Coup plays faster than Resistance, but I much prefer the gameplay of Resistance. Coup is a little like a glorified Cheat, which is good if you like Cheat, but I never have.

A game of role deduction and bluffing that definitely surpasses Werewolf, The Resistance, and the like.  It's carefully designed and super short.  Reminds me a little of Love Letter minus the card play, sort of.   Fits that same niche.   Benefits from experienced tables that know how and when to lie about their roles.

Bit of fun, but most rounds are pretty simple, depending on how much thought you put in.

If you just take it at face-value, it's a bit of a random game. You'll find yourself suddenly being unable to act without being taken out, or unable to make any actions without being countered.

Gets substantially better if you go in with a plan - what you're going to bluff, and when. Pick a story and stick to it from the start, and you'll tend to do fairly well. The fun then comes in from making your strategy work when things go wrong. Even then, games are a little too short to do too much with it.

RATING: 8
Poker for the 21st Century.  This game is a work of genius. Only five characters, all created to equally counterweight each other.  It can be played strictly based on strategy or you can ‘bluff.’  I’m usually not a fan of bluffing games, but this one seems perfect as you actually don’t have to bluff to win.  There is strategy here, especially when played with the “Reformation” expansion.  For new players, I recommend one round of the base game to understand each of the characters’ abilities, and then jump right into the expansion “Reformation.”  
Regarding downsides: You really need four or five players; any more or less can cause issues, although six is good when working in ‘teams’ with the “Reformation” expansion (because when players start out they are only focused on the three players on the ‘opposing’ team).  Player elimination is here, but made up for by the short game play (just like Poker).   
In a similar marketing tactic as “Love Letter”, I really wish they offered this game in more of a variety of re-themed sets to the general market (and not just limited-edition convention exclusives).  This game is great for non-gamers, but if we had more themes to choose from, we could tailor the set to the particular audience we are introducing it to.  Also, at this point, Coup and its expansion “Coup: Reformation” really should be packaged together as it only adds a few more cards to an already scant deck, but I suspect the publisher gets more returns on profit by selling them separately.

Quick & simple hidden role card game. Strong bluffing element.

Elegant is the word here - the game cards are Duke, Captain, Ambassador, Assassin, Contessa and that's it. Keep your cards alive by keeping them face down, lie about what they are and try not to get caught out.

This game is stupid popular. Most people I've played it with love it.

There is one small issue we've encountered with the game. There's a mechanism where any player, not just the one you're interacting with, can call you out on a bluff. Calling a bluff is risky - if they can satisfy it, you lose a life instantly. So no one ever calls a bluff if it's not their turn.

Maybe there's a house rule that can fix it? Otherwise this is a pretty decent game, only made worse because Coup G54 is available and better in almost every way.

The bluffer's game. Way more fun than BS (the playing card game) because it doesn't create frustrating stalemates where you get punished with picking up that pile of cards. Coup also ends quickly so everyone can get back in for another round. Great filler game when waiting for something with your friends.

 'boring' thou art a four letter word :: .. 'c o  u  p' ... so you can be two characters and coup someone with seven coins and for sure at ten coins .. I can see where this could be considered a real 'party game' .. but with lots of people included (maybe 15)..as it stands, it just does not hold water .. why not have people play more than two characters (at least three and better yet four) .. one can be eliminated so quickly either by guessing wrong; being challenged; being coup-ed; or being assassinated ... this holds little appeal, there is no strategy; no tension; no plan ... just guessing .. and no defense against a 7 or 10 coin coup ... very little for me to recommend ... nearly every other filler//party game would be my choice to act as a bridge to a more meaty strategic session ... this one just annoys me so much .. even though I have been roped in many times .. I still come out feeling yucky ..

Fun game, I like that when a player wins a challenge their character card goes back in the deck. When explaining this game, it's best to play a practice game with all players cards face up, this way you can talk through the potential options new players have with their cards. After a game or so, new players quickly understand each character's actions.

Coup is a bluffing/social-deduction game that is fairly easy to learn and plays very quickly.  There is player elimination but the games are usually under 10 minutes so it's not a big problem.  If you enjoy bluffing games, this is a good filler.

Coup is a surprising little game, with just 15 cards, that can be great fun with the right crowd of 3 or more players.  Players who are good at bluffing do best with this one.

A neat little game of bluffing and elimination. Reminds me of Love Letter with the ability to lie your way out of trouble. Takes a few games for players to really get it, but by then I want to play something else.

Coup builds a fulfilling experience out of the bluff and call. Coup demands players lie to, doubt, and accuse each other to win. As the rulebook says, “there is no second place”. If your favorite part of playing Battlestar Galactica is yelling “CYLON!” at everyone, you’ll love Coup.

Coup plays lightning-quick. Games take only 5–10 minutes on average. The cards are quite nice. The art is distinct and very cool. My personal favorite touch is the cards’ stretched, portrait aspect ratio. The box is adorably tiny. With just the core components, Coup is downright pocketable. Perfect travel game.

RATING: 5
This is a really quick and simply card game composed of only 15 cards.  There are 5 cards with 3 copies of each.  The game is played with each player taking a turn until only one person has survived.  Each player will be dealt 2 cards which will be placed facedown after being looked at by their respective player.  Your facedown cards are your hit points.  

On your turn, you can choose to do a non-character action: which is acquiring money or spending 7 money to make an opponent lose 1 HP by having them flip a card of their choice.  Non-character actions are safe (ie can't lose HP) to the players that are performing the action.  You can perform any one of the 4 different character actions you want.  If you do, someone can accuse you of not-having that character among your two cards.  If they are right you lose an HP by flipping a character of your choice.  If they are wrong, you prove it by showing them the character and they flip one of their characters instead.  After proving you have the character, you shuffle it into the deck and draw a new card.

Some non-character and character actions can be blocked by saying that you have a particular character card.  Again, people can challenge you if people think you're lying.  Characters abilities focus on acquiring money, getting new character cards, making people lose HP (cheaper than the non-character action), and blocking the loss of HP from character actions.  The game is pretty quick and has really easy rules.  It should be a good filler for groups that like bluffing and interaction. Better than Love Letter.

I no longer own any games that have player elimination, so that's affected my enjoyment of this game.

RATING: 8
Coup is a game that depends greatly on the people you are playing with. This is one of the few filler games where a good poker face actually matters, since the bluffing aspect is what can swing a game in your favor. Memorizing the effects of the cards is important, and knowing when to push your luck is the foundation of the game. On its own, I'd give the base game a solid 8/10 because of the potential it holds. In reality the level of fun depends on how much you enjoy bluffing your opponents and keeping them wondering.

One of the greatest micro games available. It plays incredibly fast, and always has players begging for another go. Some cards are obviously better than others, but that plays to Coup's strengths, as players can bluff their way out of a bad hand. The short nature of the game opens the door for players to seek revenge from previous games, without it feeling mean. A great game to throw in your pocket before leaving for a party.

Coup
Pros
--Lying, deception, and deduction in a very pure form.
--Entirely different strategies can lead to dominance
--Fits in almost any available time slot, including teaching the rules
Cons
--Too short, to the point of being able to take any amount of risk with little consequence, as the “next round” is less than 5 minutes away
--Not a satisfying 2 player game; needs at least 3
--Getting any of the cards marked or damaged can drastically diminish the experience, moreso than most other games

Coup is great.  It's a short but sweet bluffing and deduction game... with knives.  Figuratively, of course. 
 Seriously though, the quickness of the rounds should allow all but the most sensitive to the "take that" nature of the game to enjoy themselves.

Oddly, at family get togethers, it's the kids (a gaggle of them, ages ~6 to ~13) that are the ones who play this game into oblivion.  So much so that we've had to buy several copies as they are, to put it nicely, rough on the cards.

Coup is one of those few games that I would describe as the perfect micro-game.

Amusingly, this game hinges on one concept, is this person full of **** when it comes to their hand?  Or are they telling the truth?  Because ultimately players are either holding the card they say, or they don't, but how much are you willing to be on it?  Granted, there are elements of deduction and currency to stop the game from hitting a stand-still but this isn't a game that overstays its welcome, it is just long enough and people are always keen to play it.

Let the finger pointing and accusations begin!

This is a fun light social deduction game.  The other game people play in this genre is Love Letter.  I much prefer Coup to Love Letter for the following reasons:

1).  Love Letter is a bait and switch.  They tell you "You'll get to guess what people have!" but the game is too short to narrow what you think opponents may have beyond 2 or 3 roles.

2).  Coup has a bluffing mechanic.  You can leave false trails and traps for people.  People will fall for them because they have an actual reason to; there is proper deduction here.

3).  Rather than taking 3 minutes, it takes a proper 15.  15 minutes per game allows for genuine gotcha moments.  Love Letter ultimately *feels* like filler, and I cannot remember what happened after the fact.

So, why does this only get a 6?  After repeat play, it gets rather stale.  There are few deep strategies here.  The winner is almost entirely random.  While there are good moments, the game itself is lackluster.

Para empezar compré Coup porque es del universo de Resistance pero para dos jugadores. Ese fue realmente el pretexto. Ahora bien, de dos jugadores este juego es pésimo. No sé con más, la verdad es que no llegué a jugarlo con nadie más después de la decepción que me dejó.

Lo que sí sé es que cuando juegas con más jugadores eventualmente durante el transcurso del juego llegas al punto donde solo dos jugadores quedan vivos y por lo tanto la mecánica es la misma que ya experimenté, así que quiero evitarme la pena.

El problema es que todo es muy predecible cuando quedan dos personas y por lo tanto no es nada divertido.

What a fun game to play! This is one that depends on your table getting into the metagame, playing the other players at the table, pushing how much they can lie, and in my opinion, the biggest hyjinks will only come if the players are willing to play the table. I've had some tremendously fun times bluffing a single card in my hand into 3 different cards, winning the game ... and then the whole table turns to you with the most glorious face of malice. :devil:

[2016 February 26; 23 plays; 6/10]
I still enjoy this game, but it's a bit light and bluffing games have started to stress me out more than high-stakes strategy games.

RATING: 9
I used this game to introduce non board game players to the board game world. The cards wore out so quickly because people kept playing them.

Pros:
1. Very fast and easy to explain especially with the game's player's reference card, and give it a whirl whilst explaining.
2. It only takes < 10 mins.
3. Deceptively simple, but very enjoyable when it goes down to bluffing and calling bluffs.
4. Beautiful art and cast of characters.

Cons:
1. May seem unfair and broken if everyone abuses the duke powers -->
2. Because of this, house rules may or may not be required for a better game play in your specific gaming group.(But we enjoy doing this so maybe it's a good thing?)

Very recommended for gaming groups that are:
1. New to gaming
2. More of a tactical person rather than strategical(Strategy works better in Avalon)
3. Wants a quick game that can be repeated over and over again.

Not recommended for:
1. People who dislike direct competition ("I am going to assassinate you, right now :D")
2. People who prefer more long-term strategy games
3. People who hate lying/bluffing (It is very required to do so to have fun and or win)

Not so much a hidden identity deduction game as a 'have a wild guess as to who I am game', as the hidden identities change constantly and are shuffled into and out of the deck, regardless of whether you guess correctly or not.

There is absolutely no reason for you to ever bluff as you will lose your card and the card abilities aren't good enough to warrant the risk.

Only played a single game but it seemed the player that won was the player who did not participate, i.e. never accused anyone, never trying to block any one etc, etc. 

I like the idea of having two 'lives' as it were however this game is about as much fun as guessing whether the next card in a standard deck is red or black.

A light filler with quite a bit of bite due to the bluffing required to win.

It's a toss up between this and Love Letter for this particular niche...but I think Coup just edges it for me. It does require a little more explanation for new players than Love Letter, but not that much extra and it's only ever been a problem with the inebriated.

If there's a game that can get in the ring with Love Letter to fight for the "King of the Fillers" title, it's Coup.

The rules are simple, the choices/bluffs are exhilarating, and the counter choices/bluffs are risky.  Absolutely fantastic mix of risk/reward.

Like Love Letter, even if you're knocked out quickly, each game only last 10-15 minutes, so you won't be waiting long.

I highly recommend getting the Reformation expansion and using the inquisitors and allegiance cards as soon as you can.  The replacement role and extra layer of allegiances is perfect.

It has some serious charm when you have a good game going. Unfortunately, other times it ends with unsatisfactory correct guessing that doesn't feel much like a game at all.

Treachery and backstabbing that moves almost too fast (for me) to follow. 15 cards and a handful of coins hide a surprisingly complex game that can be played in minutes.

The bluffing is quite targeted and cutthroat here. A lot of bluffs boil down to what is absolutely necessary to claim. Player agency does not feel very high here.
The nature of the game causes all those with 1 influence to gang up on those with 2 influence, generally keeping players in the game until it is just about to end.

I think this is a well designed game, but for it to be great to me it would require a group I just don't have. One who can play the game without letting emotions get involved, because sadly (for me) this is one of those games where you can just pick a person to lose and make it happen. Perhaps at the expense of your own victory, sure, but nonetheless the game is over for the other player. Just not my cup of tea with my main game group, but I imagine with the right group this is a riot!

Interesting bluffing game. I enjoy this a lot more than Love Letter. There are still some elements were a player becomes unbeatable (due to the right combination of cards and a bit of a last-man-standing problem) but with a game as light as this, it's no biggie. In fact, being unstoppable is sort of part of the game.  Best play is players working together to stop one player from getting to this point. Then let the other players eat each other alive.  Amusing stuff for the 10 minutes this is.

Rock/Paper/Scissors only you get to lie to each other about what you're throwing? I rate this slightly better than the Resistance games because at least there's some currency to use as the faintest semblance of a mechanic, but still, I will never play this again. 90% of the game is just lying to other players or guessing whether or not they are lying to you. As with Resistance, I can sort of understand why some people might find this fun, but it is absolutely not for me.

Coup is the perfect player-elimination game. It's over in about 5 minutes, so eliminated players never have to wait around long for the next round to start. And the game is fun enough that you'll rarely play just one round.

Picked this up to play while camping after the huge success we had with "The Resistance".  Have only played one or two learning games.  We tend to just play the Resistance if we want to play a social deduction game.

Great, quick bluffing game set in the "Resistance"-unviserse. This one feels a bit game-ier than its big brother, which I think is awesome. It's so fast and crazy fun that everyone in the group will be begging for "just one more round!" over and over again. A few more characters would've been nice for added variety.

11/17/15: Good use of the bluffing mechanic. 6p doable, but it's harder to bluff as there are fewer cards in the court. 5p better: more uncertainty, more opportunities to push your opponents' boundaries.

RATING: 7
Fun game. Sweet spot is 5-6, 6 is ideal. All about bluffing and deduction. Good one to play when you are in the mood for something like the resistance but don't have enough players for a good game of that.

Rated 8 because although it is a lot fun it's also a very quick and easy game to play. Basically a game of bluff. After your first game, games should take 5 - 10 minutes if playing with 4 players. Really enjoyable as a quick party game, or between 2 bigger games, a great way to end Games Night.

This is another one of those simple, portable games, but it has a fair amount of depth for what it is. Great game to start off a game night with. Introduces concepts to new players that translate well to more complex games. Great artwork on the cards. My only complaint is that it isn't as fun with only 2 players, but it's still a good time.

Tons of fun to play with friends. Best with 3 or more players.

Definit Filler game, but recommend to all.

Probably falls into the gamers game trap. Super fun but maybe not for the random intros - prob can only get good if you spend the mental energy to learn all the characters as opposed to one night.

Edit after many plays: I've had ~10 sessions of this game with multiple plays each. People range from very quickly grasping to taking awhile.

Reactions have run from ravenous fandom to lukewarm. I think the reason for this is that the game is very focused on strategic bluffing (different than the bluffing in skulls for example but I'm having trouble articulating why - I guess because the bluffing here has a bit of "engine building" elements where skulls is just pure people reading). If you like that you'll like this game. If you don't you won't. 

Decisive, but is so quick and "efficient" (meaning everything a player does is important to be paying attention to and nothing is fiddly) that it's way more likely than not to be a hit with a group of gamers, even if one person isn't quite vibing it.

The high player count makes this a great game to have available at game nights. I stink at it pretty miserably, but it's fun to play!

Played once. Light weight bluffing game. A party game for gamers. Not a category of games I really care for but the rules are quick to learn and it is over very quickly so I have no complaints if playing it keeps the group happy. June 2013

*UPDATE* Played anouther few times. I don't dislike the game as much as I do The Resistance but only because it is over quicker. Only of interest to me because it adds veriety to the games I usually play making me a more rounded gamer. August 2013

Beautiful, streamlined game mechanics.  

It's a simple, elegant bluff-and-counterbluff that actually makes for a fast and frenetic two-player experience.  

Most games of this type don't come off well with only two players, but this one does - and with flying colors.

It would have been nice to have seen varying art for the different cards, but I understand the expansion addresses this.

A bit trickier than Love Letter, but with more depth. The bluffing aspect makes each game unique and means that long sessions of Coup stay fresh. 

The Inquisitor expansion is useful for increasing the card count to allow for bigger games. I find the Inquisitor unbalances the late game and prefer playing with the Ambassador. Team rules add a fun and interesting dynamic to the game, an overall very well-received modification.

I've tried, I've really tried. I've played this game many times, trying to understand why I don't like it. Maybe I just don't get it? The bluffing element should appeal to me, but (to my mind) it's just too convoluted. "Pretend (or not) that you have any one of these three powers. Then pretend (or not) that you can block it. Or call someone's bluff on any of the previous." I prefer the simplicity of Kakerlaken Poker. 

I don't mind being the one person who doesn't like a game (7 Wonders?), but I'm doubly amazed that this game has become such a hit. It just seems unnecessarily complicated to take off like it has.

Coup is a bluffing game. Each player has two cards with unique abilities. They then take actions convincing others they actually have the appropriate cards to take that action. Slightly more involved than Skull, Coup is enjoyable and deserves a few rounds back to back for each play session. It works well as a pallet cleanser. There is some depth and strategy here, but it is mainly light an fun. There is some information to base your calls and bluffs upon, but for the most part, Coup goes by your gut. It has never been the most memorable game of the night, but it has always been a good couple rounds to play.

A bluffing game that is fun depending on the group of people you are playing with.

Light games consisting of a small deck of cards and hidden roles are in right now.

Coup is the best one.

Equal parts deduction, calculation, and deception, Coup forces you try and survive five tense minutes in which players use the powers of face down character cards to accumulate resources and eliminate other players.  You usually have to lie about what you have in order to get an edge.  That means you have to catch other players 

When you consider the price, the accessibility, and the quality of this game, there is no reason for you not buy a copy of it RIGHT NOW!

I like this game, but it's proving to be a tough sell to get it to the table.  A lot of people I play with seem to get confused by it, either because they feel there are too many available choices or they don't get what they can/should do.

I like this OK, but I think I would almost always rather play Love Letter, scratches the same itches but better for me. The actions you take feel like you're playing a game, but there aren't really any mechanics other than choosing to lie or not lie. The game feels really lacking.

I dunno. I can't compare it favourably to Mascarade or Love Letter. We also played as a group of beginners and one who knew how to play, leading to a confused mix of learners vs someone who knew what they were doing. I'd play it again but I think it would need numerous plays for the real depth to come out - something I can't be bothered to give time to.

RATING: 8
While set in the same universe as The Resistance, and containing deduction and hidden roles, Coup is much closer to a game of BS than a game of Werewolf. Players each receive two hidden roles (out of a possible five). Each role provides a specific powerful action to the player. A player's turn simply consists of taking one of these actions. 

The catch is that a player can take any action they choose, regardless of what roles they actually possess. It then becomes incumbent on the other players to decide whether or not to call the bluff. If a bluff is called, either the caller or the call-ee will lose one of their roles. It stays face up on the table for all to see. If a player loses both his roles, he is eliminated from the game. 

Games take under 15 minutes to play and provide some wonderful group dynamics. I like the moment that happens when someone takes the perfect action for the situation and no one at the table believes it but no one wants to call them on it either, so they just get to do it while everyone else looks at each other disgustedly. It almost has to be played multiple times in a row as players learn both the interactions of the cards themselves as well as their interactions with each other. This is a great example of a game that plays much "bigger" than the rules or components would suggest; the game is really all about the people playing it.

I'll be honest - social deduction games are not my favorite form of interaction (I lean towards military-political negotiation, and even moreso economic haggling and bartering). Also, don't get me wrong, I *love* games with high levels of interaction (I'm not talking about the subtle kind of interaction that occurs when someone "drafts" you action before you in working placement games). With that said, Coup is nonetheless a rich and intricate micro-game that plays out quickly and continuously moves towards a game-end scenario.

On par with The Resistance but playable with fewer players which makes it a great partner to have on hand for the more social gaming crowd.  

I love how the game really benefits from the well timed lie rather than bluffing being the main point of the game.  Better players live by the rule "tell the truth 99% of the time and that 1% you lie will be glorious".

First couple of plays I hated it... then I came to think it's ok

Now I bought it and I'm kinda not liking it so much any more.

It's a light game, easy enough for non gamers, small enough to bring it to the pub and fast enough that you can get plenty of games.

Mark hit the nail on the head with what I dislike about it being the player elimination aspect - even if you go down to one card early you're basically also eliminated on the rationale that you can't really come back from there and your choices are limited because of it.

I guess the flip point to that is that at least the rounds are fast enough that player elimination isn't an issue and it also does depend on the crowd you're playing with - like for instance if it's a pub/social thing

Hm. I didn't hate this, but after all the hype, I had expected more. Another game in the vein of "Hoax", much reduced (which I like), but with a very limited amount of possibilities and often too little possibility to stop others. The risk of challenging is very large, considering there is not the slightest bit of information on the table. All in all, the game feels a bit unrefined to me. The other players liked it more, and I didn't mind playing it four times in a row, but I won't suggest it in the future, I guess.

Preliminary rating after two sessions (10ish games?)—as it's tiny, plays up to 6, and quickly, too.  Oh, yeah—and it's pretty nifty.  You instantaneously recognize fatal errors as soon as they leave your mouth, with no chance to bite them back...  But what the hell—reset and get your revenge in the next round!

A great filler that should be standard equipment in every game night go-bag.

(I'll be recording each session—multiple games—as a single play.)

I don't know what I am missing but neither I not any of the people I have played it with liked this game at all.  The best comments were "at least it is short".  

Unlike other bluffing games where there is some solid information you can use to try and determine if someone is bluffing Coup just seems to purely be about whether you can lie well, or conversely are good at telling when someone is lying.

People seem to really like this but for me, every single bluffing game where your bluff has to be consistent with other information that is known or can be learned (ie: One Night Ultimate Werewolf) is a better game.

Coup is a game all about knowing when to lie and what lie is the most compelling lie. Evidently I’m not good at either of these things. I appear not to have the skill set required to be an everduking bastard, which is why Jesse usually wins this. The asshole then has the gall to claim he practically never lies. Never lies my ass. He lies like a Swedish rug, but I can never catch him at it. I bought the Reformation expansion just so I can be immune to him.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

Really just Citadels crossed with the children's card game 'Cheat', this is a light-hearted party game with more players being better.

Kurzweiliges Bluffinggame

RATING: 3.5
I can see this game being fun for some people, but it's not for me.  The bluffing is not particularly engaging or entertaining.  I'm usually bored, which says something as Coup plays fast.  Mascarade feels similar, but is better.

It's fun, it's light and it's fast. A little harder to teach than your average gateway but not so hard that it's daunting. Coup is the perfect on the go, need to kill a 15 minutes filler game. It's a decent palette cleanser. Having said that, I wouldn't play this for 2 hours or you won't want to play in like a month.

Maybe bluffing games just aren't really my bag, but this was only so-so for me.  I feel like there's probably strategy to this game, but I don't feel compelled to figure it out (the extremely short length might contribute to this).  Like Resistance, if you don't commit 100% to Coup the game will be pointless random guessing for 5 minutes; alternatively, you could spend a lot of time working the game out and make it an interesting 5 minutes.  We'll see if the game improves with repeated plays, and given that you can actually play the game in less than 10 minutes (I'm looking at you Love Letter) I imagine it will be played again for lack of a better super-short game.

...or not.  Given away to a good home.

RATING: N/A
3p, 4p, 5p or 6p? A card game with hidden roles, deduction, bluffing, take that and player elimination. Similar to Mascarade and Love Letter. I played Coup with two groups, and it wasn't a hit with either group. For us, the gameplay was fairly slow, awkward and unexciting. Similarly, Mascarade and Love Letter lacked excitement and weren't hits. Though, Coup was more fun than Love Letter. I'll keep Coup because it takes up little space and there's a chance it could be fast and exciting if we got good at it -- but I doubt we'll play it enough for that to happen.

RATING: 9.5
It can be described as a combination of Love Letter and Skull & Roses (or Liar's Dice).  Basically you have two cards and can choose an action that is either one of 3 universal actions or one associated with 4 of the 5 different cards in the deck (3 copies each of 5 different cards = 15 cards in the deck).  The trick is you might be bluffing and using an ability from a card you don't possess... and anybody can call you out on it if they don't believe you have the goods.  If you were bluffing, you permanently lose a card.  If not, the person who called you out permanently loses one.  Or everyone can take your word for it and move on.  Some cards also have counter-effects, and those can be challenged as well. Very quick and intense game.  Best of all, Coup (best with 4-6 players) fits in nicely between Love Letter (2-4 players) and The Resistance (best with 7-10 players).

This game really took me by surprise.  I resisted being persuaded to play, but I am glad that I relented.  This is a very fast game and it lends itself well to being played repeatedly.  It has a very elegant, well balanced, and simple design.  The game truly shines in the player interaction department.  Players interact with each other intensively.  Players are rewarded for both lying effectively as well as catching others in lies.  While I loathe the games that assign players on teams and they must figure out who is lying like Bang and its ugly kin, I don't mind all the titillating mendacity in this particular game because everyone is for themselves and everyone is lying.  Or are they?  I know this is a good game because I am looking forward to playing again and I am confident it will be fun.

Coup is a game that rewards you for not playing it. There's no incentive to take risks within the game itself, variance is too high, and player elimination means that this one is better off on the shelf in my book.

Bluff and counter-bluff!
Fast and simple.
Not for everybody, but great if you like lots of interaction, bluffing, gambling, elimination and a bit of deduction.

The original La Mame edition still looks best to me but I might have to pick up the French edition (Complots) too!

Social deduction game along the lines of resistance, but with improved shelf life due to the roles.

These roles provide you a little more substance to go on rather than just whether someone is lying or not and introduce more tactics for you to ponder over.

Sometimes games that are 2-6 players are better with the "right" amount of players, but Coup is great with 2, and stronger with each added player. Totally a filler game, but being around $10 for accommodating 6 people is such a great utility. Also,the setup/put away time is perfect for a filler. For what this game is, it's a perfect one.

RATING: 9
I love the artwork and aesthetics. It doesn't do anything to kick itself in the foot. The little box and the money and the cards - it's all very dashing.

I enjoy this game. It's fun. It's good. It's not the best thing ever, and you really have to get out in front of it with the lying. A lot comes down to luck of the draw and 50/50 shots, with a bit of deduction and strategy hopefully helping you out. I'm not super great at this game, but what I like about it is that it can create very amusing and interesting scenarios. And because of the shortness of the game, you never feel robbed if it doesn't go your way. It's also a great game for a versatile amount of people and it's a good go-between.

Only one quick game on the GenCon floor so far, but even that was quite fun.  There was information to go on and lots of bluffing even among strangers.  I look forward to receiving my copy and playing with people I know (or think I know).

Still gets sporadic play, but I've decided there isn't that much there unless you have a group dedicated to it, and I'd rather dedicate group time to something else.

RATING: 6
It's a very fast bluffing game that leads to a lot of cross-table interaction, and it supports a lot of players, so it's a good party game. Rules are simple and tight, and while it has an elimination mechanic, games are fast enough that players eliminated don't stay out very long. That said, it very much comes down to how fond you and your group are of bluffing games; if you are, this is an excellent rendition of the genre, and if you're not, this is an excellent rendition of a game you should walk away from.

Coup is a bluffing role playing game. The game shows last man standing politics. Coup combines various game mechanics together, for example, bluffing, role playing, various player powers, deduction and etc. For this reason, before playing game, players need to be skilled to practice characters first. After couple of plays, I still feel like the game tends to be playing Truth or Dare. According to the comparison between Coup with Mascarade by many boardgamers, for me, I prefer Mascarade more. In my opinion, Mascarade needs a little easier role playing skill to players. Moreover, Mascarade provides bigger accommodation from 2 to 13 players. Mascarade is more suitable for party size game. Anyway, Coup is also a nice bluffing game. The game provides short and fast pace progression.

Fantastic lying/bluffing game, in the same vein as Kakerlakenpoker, which I love, but this offers a few more angles (though also very slightly harder to teach/grasp). Really packs a punch for a game that consists of 15 cards and plays in 5 minutes!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An alright game, though I have a sneaking suspicion it's not going to hold up to multiple plays. When you get right down to it, it's essentially the card game "bulls**t" but with fancy clothing. 

Yeah, there are roles. Yeah, there are coins (which really are just a secondary end-game trigger). But ultimately the game comes down to one thing: calling people out for lying. 

It was pretty good fun, and it was thankfully a good length for what the game offers. However, I feel that there is no possibility for any actual deduction to take place in this game. It's all being able to read people and/or get lucky guessing. And if I'm playing that kind of a game, it would seem like normal bulls**t is a much more elegant and fun game to play, without any player elimination.

I own a homemade print and play that utilizes the French Complots art, but I'm interested in acquiring the Brazilian first edition since it has the best interface design due to the language independent iconography, on top of the uniquely quirky illustrations by Luis Francisco, and because the generic cyberpunk illustrations of the English edition are not intriguing.

Similar to Love Letter in what it does (biggest difference might be that you are allowed to lie here); playing in about 15 minutes or less, fast turns, very minimal rules, and should be fun, usually.  I say usually as I wonder if a couple small things are just a tad off (like endgame) and player # will likely effect fun where more is better, but note only played once so far.  

Tidbit - possible houserule for additional action: pay 2 to draw a card and discard another

Update - Played again and it seemed the Assassin was overpowered and basically a VERY cheap coup at only 3 bucks, we all agreed it should likely be 4 or 5 but we've only played twice at this point.

It's not great but also not bad, and seems to mostly come down to luck of the draw (you can play well early but once it's down to the last two or three people it's easy enough to think through everything and so just comes down to which cards you have left). But it's quick and good for a few laughs. It strikes me as just strictly better than Love Letter, it takes about the same amount of time and feels about the same in play except there are decisions to be made. Fun for a quick casual experience.

Personally not that big a fan of social deduction games. Another one of these games where you have secret identities and are trying to deduce who everyone else is so you can eliminate them from the game by using the Coup action (or the assassin). Overall the game just felt very samey as there's plenty of these games out there and if you're unlucky enough to be eliminated first sometimes the wait can be a bit long between games.

Almost an essential purchase at this point. The direct conflict will put some people off but if you have the right group this game shines. Just SO much good game with so little components.

RATING: 9
What an excellent game for so few cards and counters!  Every combination of two cards offers unique opportunities, strengths, weaknesses, and lines of play.  Toss in the facts that the game comes down to negotiation and  that you can always bluff creates a whole new level of intrigue.  Some of these things will put off gamers looking for a sterile victory point exercise, but I enjoy this title more the more I play it.

I'm not sure what it means when I've played this simple game 9 times and still wouldn't be able to teach it to a group of new players. I think it means that it doesn't really grab me. Not like Avalon or Mascarade did at the very least.

What a great simple game. I really like Love Letter but Coup is in another category altogether, way better :thumbsup:. 

The game can be explained under 5 minutes and it takes around 12 minutes to complete a play so I don’t mind the player elimination and/or the blind guesses. It only has 15 cards.

In general, the game is pretty similar in mechanics to Love Letter, however I like the bluffing needed (much more prevalent in this game as you can lie, this is why I prefer it over Love Letter) and hidden roles is my favorite mechanic.

The production values are very well done, the game offers a very clear aid to each player and I dig the art.

I don’t have anything bad to say about Coup, in fact it has the potential to go up in my ratings. If you like bluffing buy this ASAP. Coup is a must have for me.

I still love Coup, but I have played it many times now so I have cooled a bit toward the game. Also there is a new version available that improves over vanilla Coup.

I no longer believe that  Coup: Guatemala 1954 (or   Coup: Rebellion G54) is a better edition of the game. They are just different games (with the same core rules) but sometimes I crave playing the original Coup over the others. Coup: Guatemala 1954 adds complexity to a very simple game and sometimes I´m in the mood for that as well. I like both games and I have both in my game collection.

Coup is a great game! I’m glad I backed it on KickStarter. Love the new art and the new character (Inquisitor). I have played a lot of Coup lately and I’m not sure I want to play it with 10 players. I feel it is best with 6, but it is a nice feature to be able to play it with 10 players.

The chips that came with the KS edition peel off easily.

All other comments remain the same; please refer to my Coup comments on the other entry (La Mame Edition).

What a simple game but I love it.  It's just plain nasty.  One of the games ended in a death cycle as it become very clear what everyone had and it was a grind to finish.  In the end, a full table (5 or 6) is a must but it's a fun game that doesn't overstay its welcome.

In general I don't like fillers.  I don't even care for most games less than an hour, so a 5-minute game isn't normally going to get considered.

Coup, however, is simple and beautiful.  It's Liar's Dice with no math harder than counting to 10, a straightforward bluffing game which plays incredibly well assuming the players have a good sense of humor.  I played 9 hands at BGG.CON and had a blast.

I'll be P&Ping this one now, and buying an official copy whenever they get wide distribution in the USA.

A bluffing game where players can win by not bluffing. Or bluffing all the time. Or bluffing some of the time.

Its a bluffing game set in the world of the Resistance. Has nice artwork and components. 

Theme is kinda somewhat politics (i.e. scandals, lying through your teeth, smiling for the cameras, assassinations, courtesans, diplomacy, kissing babies)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very fun, very light, very quick (but brutal) bluffing game with a lot of 'gotcha' plays and tantalising decisions on both your own and everyone else's turns - right up my street.

While payers get knocked out, the internal bash-the-leader balance of the game means this generally happens in the end game so even if you have been knocked out you won't be sitting out for long - and it's almost as fun to watch as it is to play.

Except for the fact that it's a quick playing filler, why does this game have such a high rating?!?  After two plays I was done... 

Maybe it's the simplistic rules, or the bluffing element (I can't bluff... I have no poker face at all), or the fact that it's an elimination game (a mechanism that good games should avoid), but I just can't see myself ever playing again.

RATING: 8
My rating here reflects my impression after only two plays. I suspect it will take more for my opinion to really solidify, and I even think this rating will probably go up. The game is a bit like Mascarade, but the chaos is slightly more controlled. The strategy is not immediately obvious, but even after two plays, I am beginning to see some depths worth exploring.

Update: I have more than 20 plays under my belt now and this game is definitely better than my initial impression. It may take a few plays for the group to get into the bluffing and challenging mindset, but once they do, this game is a blast. It plays fast, so the player elimination isn't a horrible thing. My group loves it.

It's Moderately ok. It's a fun game inbetween other games, but really it's a bluffing game that doesn't require you to bluff... If this game ended in the 15-30 min range and didn't have such a clear path to obtaining the "Coup" it would be more fun... Typically the first 5 mins are fun and interactive, but then the guy that has coin just says "coup" and is so hard to catch up to there really isn't ever an opportunity for upset... so really, I like it... but in an attempt to make it quick, I feel like the devs tried to make the coup too accessible.

* Kickstarted! *

Bluff your way to victory, but be careful about challenges because they could either cost you powers… or the game. Forget The Resistance: this newer game plays faster, is more intense, and really requires you read the other players.

MINUS: goes a bit fast

ESSENTIAL for those who want a fast, fun and intense starter/closing game in their collection for under $20.

RATING: 8.2
It's not often that I enjoy games of bluff or games of elimination, but Coup makes both mechanics very enjoyable.  Limiting players to only a handful of decisions per turn makes it easy to remember what to do so, after a couple plays, bluffing is easier since you don't have to constantly check your reference card.  Also, making each of those turns start and end quickly, even if you are out immediately, you're never out very long.  This is a very interesting and enjoyable game that plays in 5 or 10 minutes and can be played multiple times without exhausting the game itself.

"Meh: the Game", as far as I am concerned. My biggest issue with it is that it's just straight up lying with very little contextual clues, and at this point we might as well be talking about our sex-lives instead.

However, seems to work as a fast filler for new and not-yet-gamers, and the art is cool, so I'm keeping it.

First games are cool and you can't stop also because it plays very quickly. But after this initial burst you'll realize that it's repetitive and that bluffing and luck are separated by a thin line. However it's a cheap filler game that comes in a nice small box with nice cards so it's worth to buy. [***Ultra-Pro sleeve size: 65x100 - Orange (82660, 50/pack) - (65 x 100mm)***]

Pretty interesting game. I like that the strategy changes depending on the playstyle of the other players (ie. if they're more bluffing or conservative).

A short filler game that involves some deduction and lots of bluffing. Players are all attempting to rid competitors of their influence in court, (their lifes), by taking actions such as stealing money, taxing, and assainating. Each players begins the game with 2 characters (Duke, Captain, Assasin, Ambassador and Contessa), and play continues until only player still has "influence" in court. You may take the actions indicated by the cards you possess, or you may claim to play an action reserved to a character you do not have in your hand (bluffing). In either case, you may take that action unless someone calls your bluff. If you indeed were bluffing, then you will lose a life, but if you weren't bluffing, then the challenger will lose a life.

Great game. Only takes about 15 mins to play which is great, but it is still jam-packed with strategy and action.

Free-for-all hidden role card game with bluffing and chaos. More decisions than Love Letter, less chaos than Mascarade, both of which are good things. There seemed to be more freedom in the early game, though, and endgames can drag out when bluffing and challenging are no longer viable options. The best way to win is to never have to bluff.

This game made a great first impression on me but has not held up in more plays.  Mostly because telling the truth seems to be overpowered, in my experience lying is rarely worth the risk.  I have not played this with the expansion, hopefully it refreshes it for me.

Update:  I still haven't played with the expansion but I like it more now than I did a few months ago, I think player count is a huge factor.

RATING: 8.5
Fun, fast, sometimes epic, generates lots of great moments, sometimes frustrating but you know from the get go that this is not a fair playing field. The game evolved as we learned counter and counter-bluffing, and how to use each role fully.

This is probably our favorite party/filler game in my collection, an instant classic. Usually play from 5 to 8 (w/ expansion), the base game is still very good, but the Inquisitor addition in the extension makes for a much better game overall, as the Ambassador does adds has much bluffing potential - it's rare to contest an Ambassador call.

Only caveat is that the last few turns with 2 (sometimes 3) remaining players can be a bit predictable if roles are known (it,s hard to bluff at this stage unless you have an ambassador/just drew some new cards). Does not diminish the rest of the game for us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In the debate over which microgame is better, Coup or Love Letter, I'm firmly in the Coup camp. I don't dislike Love Letter, but Coup is the game I want to play again.

I have introduced this to at least 25 people. Almost everyone has liked it and preferred it to Love Letter and even, for a surprising number of people, The Resistance. Given the range of people I've introduced this to, their enthusiastic response, and high demand for the new Resistance-themed version, this could become a modern classic and a staple of many collections.

For me, Coup rates an 8 and is trending up. Because it's a bluffing game the experience depends a great deal on the people at the table. With people who get this game this is a great game.

One downside is that with five roles, after enough plays with the same group, certain patterns will emerge. This is where Coup: Guatemala 1954 comes in. It has the same structure as Coup but comes with 25 different roles. You choose five roles for the game and go from there. Excellent!

RATING: 8
I have the original City State edition as well as this one, the Resistance themed edition with new artwork. 

This new edition should make Coup the hit it deserves to be. I've been playing it regularly for over a year and have introduced it to several dozen people. Most people have liked it a great deal, and many have wanted their own copy. Now they can finally get one.

See my notes on the original edition for additional comments.

A fun filler that constantly astounds me at how terrible I am at it.  As bluffing is the central mechanic, essentially the meta game IS the game.  But this gives it more legs than a similar game like Love Letter.

RATING: 8
Good bluffing game that is not entirely made out of bluffing. This game grew on me fast. Fast play, tense moments and interesting game dynamic. But then something happened and we started not playing it. Maybe we wanted to play Resistance or Secret Hitler more for social deduction. But I came back to it after a while and enjoyed it even more. I guess small games have phases for people. Good vibrant art also helps with this. I recommend this game since you can get it for 10 Bucks and it is very fun.

For me this is a love/hate relationship with this game. I like it, but I simply suck at it. My 8 years old kicks me out. I probably don;t put much effort as I should. Enjoyable game, especially for those who are experts with bluffing and poker face.

A nice fast hidden role game with tons of bluffing.  Reminds me a bit of Love Letter, but I think I like this a hair more.  This game probably needs more people to be good, though.  The Inquisitor role in the Kickstarter version add a nice little variant that replaces the Ambassador, if you want to give that a try.

This game is quick, short, cheap, and usually a lot of fun. This is another deduction game, but the penalties can be so severe for incorrectly guessing or being caught in a lie that often (in our experiences anyway) people will just always be honest and be too scared to accuse others of lying. For this we docked a few points but it's still a great game.

This is not a game that I care to ever play again even when considering its short play time.  Though I wouldn't say the game is stressful, I just don't like the sort of "take-that" nature of the game.  The artwork on the Indie Boards and Cards version is simply awful.  I think that even if I enjoyed the game there's no way I would ever pay for such ugly artwork.

One of the best "filler" games on the market. Extremely quick games filled with treachery, lying and back-stabbing, much like real life politics. You don't feel bad when you're eliminated because a new game will likely be starting in mere moments. Totally enjoyable for master bluffers and honest do-gooders alike. Always a blast when it hits the table, and it hits the table often.

Fun social deduction game that plays in less than 10 min per round.  Everyone has a role that allows them to do an action against or in defense of anyone else. But you can also just lie and say that you have a role, that is until someone calls you out on it! Mix between the older card game "BS" and games like resistance/werewolf. Dead simple to learn, play setup is easy, and the game is cheap. Always a good ice breaker or time killer.

Coup is basically dystopian sci-fi poker, in a number of ways. The games are quite short, usually, and the entire play of the game is about bluffing. This game is best enjoyed casually among friends, preferably with alcohol involved. It's a fairly simple game that takes very little time to explain, and the opportunities the game allows for one-on-one stare-downs about particular moves (is he/she bluffing, or not?) can be a great laugh for everyone at the table. Highly, highly recommended.

This quick filler is easy to teach, easy to play, and a ton of fun. It's all about bluffing (using special actions to which you may or may not be entitled) and calling bluffs in order to get ahead and bring others down. It is a 'last man standing' sort of game which normally I'd hesitate to recommend but it is super fast so no-one has to be left out for long.

I will add that this may not be for your group, but it works outstandingly with my group and that is just about the only reason a gave it a 10. It's a great game and I feel it deserves some love, but in my opinion it's nothing too special. It plays well, has a great player range, and is really quick and even has a little strategy.

Awesome bluffing game that needs to hit the table more but doesn't as it's been played many, many times. It plays quickly, though, so I shouldn't have excuses. It does play well at around 4 players, so that those who are eliminated aren't sitting around for too long.

RATING: 5
Have via the Kickstarter version of Reformation.

Coup's art is just brilliant, portraying a blend of fantastical sci-fi like Coruscant in Phantom Menace or The Capital in Hunger Games.

The theme is ultimately pasted on to a tidy little game of bluffing and intrigue, where you can do anything you'd like whenever you'd like unless someone challenges you and it turns out your lying. In that event, you lose an influence as well as flip a card face up. When you run out of influence or face down cards, you're out. You only start with two cards face down, and there's no way to get more (although there are several methods of exchanging).

The upside of this is the downside - it encourages you to play fast and loose with both your bluffs and your challenges, because each time you're caught or wrong you're 50% out of the game on card flips even if you have tons of influence.

If that plays too fast for you or dis-incents your crowd from doing any lying, for smaller games you could say it's two influence to cause a flip and just drop an influence coin on a card to track its status. This would encourage both more bluffing and and more challenging and would actually add a second layer of bluffing, since people could lie about losing a challenge to confuse people but still take the influence hit. I'll try it next time I get past a few rounds.

This is another one of those simple, portable games, but it has a fair amount of depth for what it is. Great game to start off a game night with. Introduces concepts to new players that translate well to more complex games.  Great artwork on the cards.  My only complaint is that it isn't as fun with only 2 players, but it's still a good time.

Tons of fun to play with friends. Best with 3 or more players.

Lying, bluffing, stealing, assassinating each other - this sounds like a lot of fun, but it falls flat and does not give the laughs and excitement of games like Resistance and Kakerlakenpoker. When I win I don't feel I've accomplished anything, when I lose I don't feel I've done anything wrong.

A nice little filler with interesting bluffs and deduction.
The only issue I had with the game is the player elimination. It is short enough to justify it but still it feels boring to see players around the board just watching for 10 minutes or whatever.

For me personally I prefer to play Love Letter with 3-4 players and then I would rather play The Resistance with 5-6 players.

RATING: N/A
In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.

Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence – i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:
• Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.
• Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.
• Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.
• Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.
• Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.

Select your fellow players carefully. They must be capable of telling a lie every once in awhile, allow other players to get away with a lie to improve play and be able to vary their strategy. 
I once played with against this girl with only one strategy, claim she had the duke, claim tax and go for a coup. It worked for her the first two games but after that nobody believed her anymore. That was still fine but she kept using the same strategy.

RATING: 4
I know making those kind of games is pretty hard. I liked the idea behind, but did not really like much the results. Most actions are similar, I would have preferred that each role had a totally different aspect.

The addition of coins could have added a new dimension to the game but it has been limited to assasinate for 3 or for 7. So it is merely a tim delayed action.

Another problem is that if people do not bluff enough, you end up in a situation where the game is boring. One way to increase bluffing would be that guessing out your opponent's role could kill him. This would prevent players from using the same role all the time. If there are no basic actions, that would force players to bluff even more.

Another thing that would give player more options once they lost a life is to use the ability of the revealed card. So that at least they still have the option to play 2 actions.

So great ideas, but I think I would prefer something with more meat or more depth. Maybe a combination of love letter, coup and resistance would be nice.

RATING: 7
A nice roles selection and bluffing game in under 15 minutes.  Takes a few plays to get the hang of the different roles and choices to bluff.  Plays quickly and allows a few good choices. 

[Update] I think it plays well with 4 or 5 players.  With 6, there are not enough cards to allow for sufficient room to bluff or acquire certain roles.  I think that with 6 players, there needs to be four cards of each role/character.  This game should scale for the number of players.  

[Update]  Also, with three players, I would suggest thinning the standard deck by one less card of each character.

RATING: 8
Quite enjoyable although this one is likely quite group dependent.  Quite a bit of bluffing, table talk, diversionary talks, and theft along with assassination to see who is the last person standing.  Plays in only 10-15 minutes.

Out of the new crop of social experiement games (i.e. Werewolf/Mafia/etc) this was probably the most interesting of games. Although we played the game wrong I could see what that what was there in the game has a lot more teeth than its cousins. It's sister game Resistence shares much with the paradigm Werewolf developed, but took it a step further. With Coup the designer has stepped out of the hidden team element of the game, turning sneaky and blind play into a game that would seem worthy of the title as "ground breaking" for the genre. I handily enjoyed my 3 plays of the game, again even though we played the rules incorrectly. I went back and saw that error in the gameplay I was taught and now I am even more excited to give this one a go as having to discard a successful challenged character, and draw a new one, totally kicks the game up another notch. 

[u]Updated Comments:[/u]
Yup, as I expected when playing with the correct rules the game gets even better. That is a lot of game in a little package, and at some point I will definitely be picking up a copy of this as it is essential to any gamer's collection.

Perfect game for most people I play with from the hardcore to the more casual gamer. Fast play with enough strategy that you can weasel out a victory, but also built so that anyone can win. One of my favorite social deception games that doesn't feel as bogged down as The Resistance or Avalon can get, or as potentially boring like Ultimate werewolf if you get one of the inactive roles.

I've purchased at least 5 copies of this game so far, primarily as gifts for others who like it.

This has a TON of game in the box for the price--one of the, if not the top game for that metric.  The rules are simple, there are multiple strategies, and it REALLY depends on who you play with how the game will go.  You really have to pay attention to other people and have situational awareness.  There's bluffing and strategy and reading people.

But what's the point in calling someone else out, and risking your hide?  If you call them out successfully then you did something to benefit everyone, not really yourself.  And if you're wrong then you lose a lot.  So that's lame.

Some of the roles seem imbalanced.  Especially the Contessa seems pretty weak--it's only useful at the beginning, for blocking against the Assassin, which itself is the other weakest role.  Once people know you have it, they pin you down.

It does start to get repetitive however; and if you are or aren't good at bluffing then you tend to keep repeating the same strategies.

A bluffing game where players try and push one another out of the central government with deception, assassins, and coups.

Way too luck based. While not a bad game for its length, I do not understand the huge hype for this game.

EDIT: After 18 plays, my opinions have been unchanged, but let me flesh them out a bit more. While there definitely is thought on how each power interacts with each other and certain powers seem better early/late game, all in all the punishment for calling someone out is extremely high, which while facilitating the bluffing aspect of the game makes it a crapshoot of trying to actually deduce who is until near end game if people play cleverly enough, at which point several players might have already been eliminated. For example, let's say the first 4 players all claim Duke. While impossible, the odds of the last person being a Duke is no lower than any of the previous people.

I never imagined I'd find another hidden role game that would fit a niche in my collection, but Coup manages to do just that.

I enjoy this game, which seems somewhat at odds with the "6" I've given it. The rating is low because I'm still skeptical of how much skill factors in; luck of the draw or inter-player dynamics can sink you in a hurry no matter what. So, played as a competitive endeavor -- not so good. Played as filler entertainment with great opportunities to yell and/or talk smack with your group -- solid.

I skipped the Kickstarter the first time around because I worried that needing to be familiar with and credibly bluff all 5 roles would be a major speedbump for the AP-prone or casual gamers in my group, but experience shows that this is not at all an issue. It's really simple to teach and play. I'm using the expansion Kickstarter as an excuse to fix that mistake and get a shiny copy.

I only don't give Coup a 10 because I have played a lot, and someone with a god-hand who isn't enjoying the game can just tell the truth all the way to victory and then everyone feels disappointed. It is sometimes way too obvious when this is happening.

If somebody does something awful to you and you aren't on your toes with pretending to have the counter, there may be nothing you can do because everybody knows you don't have it. This is part of the game.

Once it gets down to 2 players, it isn't much of a game any more, and usually a foregone conclusion as both hands are known. Nevertheless, I adore the 3 player game with my best friends.

Enough people don't enjoy the theme or style of game-play that it doesn't come out very often. It doesn't have as universal appeal as plain old Skull and Roses.

Game was a lot of fun, until it became apparant that dutchessing on the first turn or two was to strong, as nobody knows enough about the cards yet to call you, and this quickly accelerates the game to the point where almost everybody has 10 coins.

Social deduction game where you are trying to eliminate the other players.

Backed the KS at the level to get this and both Resistances with the promo cards to add Merlin and Assassin to the original.  Seemed at first to be Mascarade with player elimination, but after reading the instructions I believe it'll probably be a bit different.  There's 3 copies of each role, for example, more with more players.

Sold at silent auction at CotC'14 for about $9.  Just didn't sink in with me, especially with the other hidden role games I have.

Nicer art than the original, Indie's, and the Brazilian editions, but the lack of role-specific colouring makes it difficult to quickly identify the different cards. Still an amazing bluffing game.

The Polish edition of Coup, Światowy Konflikt, adds a Political flavour to the already awesome game. Russia and Putin is the Duke, the Europeen Uinion and Merkel is the Contessa, the current political tension with Russia and Ukraine fits perfectly for Coup.

One of my favorite bluffing games.  The only downside is the progressive elimination of players who are then left to watch, but the matches are fast and exciting so it does not matter as much.  Another possible flaw is the ability of some players to win the end game simply by card counting, which is fine but gives the game a different flavor than the bluffing aspect.  I have noticed that some players are turned off by the last man standing mechanic, which is a drawback, otherwise I would give it a 10.

Fun group game - more plays will make it better. Too many of us have been trying not to bluff so that we don't get caught, which has made the game relatively boring. As groups get used to playing, the lying will get more common and the game will get more fun. 

Reformation gives this way more play time and value than I could have imagined. We don't play it as much any more, but I still think it's great. 

Good for small groups and as a filler.

Bluffing game. You start with 2 hidden characters, but they can change during the game. With a number of actions that your characters can do, you try to eliminate your opponents. But you don't necessarily have to tell the truth of which characters you have. 

This game is built on some nice ideas, but i had the feeling that i had very little control over what happened in the game. Good bluffing and lying skills are required. Since i'm not really good at that...

I really enjoy the ideas presented in this game, and the fact that it's a double-hidden identity game only makes the bluffing and social deduction that much more fun. That being said, I find that the end game can sometimes get very mechanical. You might know 3 turns from the end who will win because they can coup first, and there's nothing you can do except just play out the rest of the game. 

I still enjoy it overall, but I think I prefer Mascarade over Coup, which has similar ideas and mechanics arranged in a slightly different way.

Coup is an mediocre bluffing game that is easy to teach and plays in a short time frame.  The game will get stale because there are certain elements of the game that tends to repeat themselves (e.g. everyone declaring Duke in the beginning, etc)

I was introduced to this game last summer when my mate purchased it as a bundle of short games from Ebay. This is a straight up blagging game which takes minutes to teach and pick up but a little longer to master. You certainly need a poker face and vary your style of play or you will be quickly rumbled.
This is a game we play as a warm up to a long gaming day/evening or in between longer style games. Great fun and I have recently purchased the reformation expansion but yet to play.

Always been intimidated by bluffing games, but this is so simple and elegant. Best of all, it can be played in any mindset; it's only as stressing as you want it to be (unlike The Resistance which is often very stressful albeit good!). The game is super short, easy to explain and appeals to any skill level. You'll never play only one game, because it's so short and everyone wants revenge upon their killer. It's like a dirty love-child between Love Letter and The Resistance.

A rather fun bluffing/hidden identity game. I find that the game works best with smaller groups, since there are less copies of the same characters around, which seems to bring more bluffing to the game than when playing with more people. With more people I've found that telling the truth is often a winning strategy, at which point the game becomes "who can get the luckiest draw"...

After 5 plays, I really like this game. I don't love it. To be honest, I thought it would be a little more thinky, but all in all, Coup is pretty light. To be sure, there is strategy, and that strategy is often subtle. Nevertheless, there are only so many decisions you can make turn to turn, and those decisions are halved if you've already revealed a card. It's a little bit heavier than Love Letter, but not as pure, cute or fast. It's still a great microgame though.

By far my group's favorite party game. But there is some barrier to entry to this game. I think at this point i favor Cockroach Poker more, as it is a more pure bluffing game, without the barrier to entry. But i sure have gotten my money's worth out of this game.

This is probably the fastest game I've ever 'dimed.'

Coup is a clever little game, but I wouldn't vote it for Game of the Year.  If you enjoy micro games like Love Letter, but want a bit more bluffing involve, then I'd take a look at this.  It'll likely sit in my bag of games I always bring (just because of its size), but is not something I will be pushing on people to play every week.

Coup is easily the best 'short' game I own. It's simple enough that everyone can learn it, fast enough that if they don't get it right away they get it a second time, and it's short enough that it's easy to just play ONE more game. It's also a fairly cheap game and I recommend it to everyone who likes board games.

Nice small bluffing/deduction game. Better than Love Letter if you want a good microgame. Nothing groundbreaking but it's nice game to have if you can't get enough players for Mascarade, Resistance or One Night Werewolf. Player elimination, blahh, outdated mechanic that's only ok for Werewolf and should've went away after Bang, but if you keep the player count low it's not too bad since the game isn't too long. (3-4p is best anyway) Glad they re-themed the game.

Reinforcing the adage that sometimes the simplest designs are the best, Coup manages to take just a handful of cards and create a deep bluffing game that is easy to pick up and understand. It comes into it's own when you play with people you know well as it can take on a whole new meta quality.

RATING: 6
Quick little card game of hidden roles,variable player powers and TONS OF BLUFFING. The bluffing aspect made it hard for our group because some us are born liars and others got no "poker face" and we're at a HUGE disadvantage. Additionally, because of the different abilities of each role, we had to keep checking our cards, which did not help our bluffs. Finally, one in our group decided he would play better by not even looking at his cards... and he won... and broke the game. If your group played this enough to become familiar with the various roles and their abilities you could enjoy this game a lot as you would be able to embrace the crucial bluffing aspect. Our group likes variety and this game would not get played enough for us to get familiar with the roles (especially after our first game night where we witnessed the game get "broken").

10/24/17 Played five games. Coup is a party game; a type I loathe. You know the type. Where being sober is actually a hindrance. And its core is all about bluffing. A mechanism I don't care for when its the majority of a game. Yes, there is some slight strategy to it, but not enough to offset its minuses in my book. I vow to never play it again. Coup is the worst game I've played this year.

Bluffs and double-bluffs. Coup is a very fun game to play with a bunch of liars (which is everyone, ten seconds into the first round of the game. Yes first round, it's the kind of game you don't play just once and done)!

It's a small compact game where everyone is dealt two cards (lives) from a deck of 18. Six roles, three of each, and everyone has a special action, counteraction. Then on your turn you can do either a role action or one of the generic actions (take money, or coup - which means to pay a whole bunch of money to remove one life from a player of your choice, yes, you can be eliminated). However, you don't have to take the role action of a card in your hand, you can take any role action you'd like - but if someone calls your bluff? If you didn't lie, they lose a life (and a role), and if you did well then you do. Also, if you lied, your action, well that's wasted. Then the next player goes. Repeat until there is only one.

When you play a few rounds, patterns emerge. Everyone (say all six players) claim duke in the first round, and nobody calls anyone out on it and so on. Someone hangs back, so they won't be the target of the first wave of assassinations, someone is mercilessly picked off first (last rounds winner maybe) in a collective assassination effort. It's very chaotic, but also very fun. The tension between hanging back, afraid to call someone out and risk one of your own lives, but if noone else is calling them out, can you really afford to let them have it? And slowly people start losing lives, and are eliminated. Maybe a person goes from top to dead by calling bluff against an assassination, that's two lives and out (one for calling a non-bluff and one for the assassination itself). Then suddenly, around the three or perhaps four player point the game becomes a lot more calculatory. You can see the logical outcome if the players are the roles they claimed. A duke can't beat a captain, so you can't be a duke if he's really a captain, which sucks when you have the duke in hand. He also can't let you be something that blocks the captain, so he has no reason not to call your bluff. So what can you do? Well, nothing most likely .

This whole calculatory end game is something I find very fascinating - because it's a tricky puzzle, very deterministic, but with just enough leeway for you to find that one chain of actions that can lead you to victory. The "loud" and chaotic portion of the game becomes the silence of a high level poker table.

So you have a very fun game in a small package, why is it a 6? Well... it has fallen a bit out of favour - for it's time slot I'm reaching for One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or just pass on it altogether and play a longer game. I have a thing against the shorter games, I don't find myself caring that much about the outcome - so the tension they present doesn't grip me as a much - therefore I need them to be fun, very fun, and the calculatory nature of Coups endgame isn't that fun. Plus, if we're playing it four five times, we have time for Cosmic Encounter instead so why not just?

A good game, just not one I reach for enough to rate higher. Better with the expansion, as the "teams" (they aren't teams, it's just adds another layer of interaction, it brings down the chaos and allows for more "gamey" play) are to my liking.

Played this a ton over the weekend with family and my daughter (12.) She LOVES Love Letter and I thought she'd like this. 1 game in, she was lukewarm. After the next 2-5 rounds -- she declared it her favorite game. Unseating Love Letter. And she was good at it -- winning a LOT. She created a new word which summed up her strategy. She would "ambassinate" you. Abusing the ambassador power every turn to get the card she wanted -- but she seemed to have an Ambassador every time you'd challenge her. Super funny to watch her develop the strategy and use it effectively against the rest of us.

Most of the times it's like that, but I've had a few decent runs. First few games may be hard for people to adjust to the games mechanics, but it'll hit off once they get into the groove of bluffing. 

Great filler.

A nice quick-playing deduction game that I feel is a bit boring due to the player elimination aspect in the game, and the whole balance being completely determined by whoever players want to kill off first.

A reduction in rating for the completely stupid game box, not even fitting the original components in the game, and then shipping the expansion without a box so nothing fits at all. Yes this is an issue that comes from mixing the Kickstarter edition of the first game with the retail edition of the second game, but it's still really bad.

Really great bluffing game. It's similar to Skulls, but a little more complex by replacing the balls risk-taking mechanic with a sort of rock-paper-scissors bluffing mechanic.

Too much relies on your ability to bluff. Lying to my friends isn't my idea of fun. And while I treasure short games, this one was too short. most of our games averaged around 2-3 minutes. Only thing I enjoyed was the artwork. I will not play this again.

Needs at least 4 players, methinks. Simple bluffing game that is really fun. Like eating Lays potato chips- you can't play just one game. Addictive, and you can play a session of 5 games in an hour with a decent sized group. Sharp and smart without hurting your brain.

Love the idea of this. Quick playing, deduction + bluffing, etc. The stakes are a little high, which is fine if it stays quick, but playing with slower players raises the consequences of being wrong which lowers the bluffing and bluff calling which makes the game longer, so it can easily spiral into stalemates. When this happens, it all comes down to who has the money-making roles (Duke or Captain). The Contessa is especially useless in the end-game when you're down to one role and awaiting a death by coup.

Deserves more plays to see if it comes out in the averages, but individual boring plays do happen and I suspect are quite common.

Played with friends aged 25+ and with children aged 9+. It works really well for both. The rules are pretty simple and the social aspect makes this game shine, perhaps not quite as well as ONUW, but still. It feels more like a game and less like a deduction soiré. I like it.

(22052015) Recently taught the big three of deduction at a work-event (ONUW, Resistance and Coup). Coup was easily the hardest to teach and and for people to get into. It also caused the least amount of discussion and the player elimination was a major negative point. I'll drop my score for this down a single point for now, since the game is good, but not as good as ONUW for me.

Fun game. Recommend when time is limited. Can be fun and refreshing when people are willing to bluff/challenge. Biggest issue is that some players don't remember they can block actions and end up stealing from one another without blocking. Recommend slowly going through each action/block as the game is deceptively simple and may lead to shallow plays.

RATING: 5
Bluff and use card powers to be the last player standing.

Plays: 3
Type: Deduction game = a game where you attempt to deduce something through elimination.
Complexity: Light.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: 15 mins.
Player interaction: Misdirection, conflict and targeting of other players.
Randomness: Low – initial cards, which don't matter all that much.

Replayability: High, it’s quick so why not go again? Plays very fast and every decision matters.
Fun: Quite fun. Bluffing your card powers is exciting! 
Memorability: Decent for such a quick game. You're playing your opponents more than the board, which makes for a memorable experience. It's over very quickly though, there won't be any stories told.

Thematic integration: Weak. It's an abstract deduction game.
Components: Nothing special.

Who will like this: Gamers that want a filler alternative to The Resistance, without the political discussion.

This game is one of my absolute favourites. The gameplay is simple, but the strategy is deep. After The Resistance, Coup was my big introduction to bluffing games.

There are other bluffing games that have simpler rules (Skull, Cockroach Poker, for example), but Coup is still an excellent introduction to the genre. It plays quick, and the stakes are high, though these aspects are what make a bluffing game great.

Pure Ameritrash.  Can't end the game unless everyone else has to sit there waiting.  Played it again and I don't like the eliminating players aspect.  Bluffing is fine but you have to have enough extra cards that players cannot count cards.  My rating still stands at 5.  The early elimination like Risk just creates animosity in players in our group.

Good bluffing filler game.  Extremely tight and intense. I enjoy playing it thoroughly, however it is very dependent on the people and the group (which can you really fault a game for) and can fall flat into people always being honest and playing the rolls they have.  This will lead people into complaining about imbalance in the rolls (yes, the Duke and Captain are very powerful) rather than bluffing and either 'playing' the better rolls or trying to actually obtain them.  When the game is good, it's very good...when it is bad, it's horrible.

Citadella/Mascarade jellegű szerepválasztós-karakteres-blöffölős játék. Mivel ezek már itt csücsülnek a polcon, a Coupot úgy döntöttem, hogy inkább csak applikációban vásárolom meg.

Kipróbáltam AI és real userek ellen is, utóbbi nyilván élvezetesebb. A játék oké, de semmi olyan újdonságot nem nyújt, ami miatt remegnék az izgalomtól, hogy újra játszhassak vele.

Partijátéknak kiváló, ha már mindenki unja a Citadellát. A blöffölés miatt kifejezetten szórakoztató tud lenni.

Picked this up a as kickstarter (another ACT group order) and it does the job of a good filler game in that it plays quickly and is easy to learn, but does involve a bit of interesting decision making. The components are all quite good, and the artwork is excellent, and even comes with extra cards for games I don’t (yet) own. Not sure what the smaller thick cardboard token with the illustration of an alternative inquisitor is for though.

As you’d expect with this sort of game, it plays quick and deadly. One mistake can eliminate you from the game but that’s the nature of it. As such, even though there is a two player variant I’d say that this game is a ‘more players the better’ sort of experience.

Overall, good value and another worthwhile addition to the stable of fillers. It has also seen a bit of use in my lunchtime games group.

RATING: 4
Fun at first, but the more I play it, the more it starts to feel like an Elvis impersonators convention, except instead of Elvis, everyone's pretending to be the Duke. 

There's just too big of an incentive to bluff being the Duke. Then when it looks like the jig is up, you bluff Ambassador and go rifling through the deck for something more believable, like maybe Captain. It ends up just feeling really scripted after multiple plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
If Masquerade and Love Letter had a baby, this would be it. And I think Coup improves on both. There's the memory and claimed ability aspects of Masquerade, and the bluffing micro-game feel of Love Letter. It definitely has the flavor of poker as well, with the obvious bluffing parallel, but also in the calculated risks and outright forced plays. Really tense, really quick, lots of fun.

Each game is about 10 minutes long & fun for the first 6-7 minutes.  It is less stressful than, say, Werewolf or The Resistance - but otherwise similar in feeling.  The game is basically over when only 2 players remain because you can math-out who will win at that point.

We recently realised we have very few games for visiting newbies and hastily remedied the situation with Coup, Citadels, and Guillotine. Of the three, Coup is my favourite. It's apparent after a play or two (and you can't just play it once) that there is definitely a strategy to this game - it isn't just about who can lie the best (though that certainly helps). It's a really *fun* game that is so short there's no reason not to play it every single game day.

An extremely fast, player elimination card game. I have only played with 3 players but once you get into the spirit of the game this is pure entertainment, which leaves you wanting to play it again.....

After playing with 5..... this game and my rating have gone  through the roof. You amy well ask how anyone can rate a game which consists of only 15 cards so highly? Well, my rating are purely based on my personal experience of a game and how much enjoyment I have had playing it. This game delivers..... fun, fast & highly interactive! Even when you are eliminated it is nearly as much fun to watch as to play!

During a month-long dry spell at work (don't ask) this game simply took my crew by storm. Fortunately I had the reformation expansion and some extra promos from Rebellion G54.

A decidedly great bluffing game.  Received as a Christmas gift, played a few times since, and intending to purchase expansions in the near future.  However, not a great "party" game for non-regular gamers - it is mechanically a little dense.  Most problems can be fixed with the addition of new roles/cards, especially with 5+ players (another reason why I will be buying an expansion soon).

Bluffing game where you take turns to take a character action (which you may be bluffing about). Interesting concept but the game left me with two concerns. First, I felt there was too little information to call a bluff (and never did). Second, when all have hoarded gold to the unstoppable coup, kingmaking determines the game (where I was lucky). May need the right setting to play well.

RATING: 6.5
A fun game that's easy to get to the table and leads to plenty of shouting (a good thing). Player elimination kind of sucks, but it's so quick it's not that big of an issue. Never played this one just once. Although, players need to be kinda bold with the bluffing or the games turn out kinda lame.

RATING: 9
A cool filler-type game focused on bluffing. You get two cards that give you abilities, but you can pretend you are holding different cards and use abilities as if you had those cards. If you call someone on their bluff and it turns out they lied about their cards then they lose one of their two cards, which is quite deadly. You can also assassinate other players or launch "coups" against them if you have enough gold, which lets you remove their cards from play. If someone loses both their cards they're out of the game. This game ends very quickly but people get excited about it and want to play it again, usually we play at least three times in a row.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite bluffing & deception style games. I've played well over 70 games and I haven't found a person who disliked it in all the groups. After the first game, everyone seems to want to play again. Very highly recommended for a short game. Games can go by in a flash or turn into an intense duel between all the players figuring out just what cards their opponents have. 10/10

Of all the games that I liked the most from the start this game definitely was pretty good.

Easy, light, fast, and replayable made it an instant add to my collection at first, and while willing to keep playing with new cards, they didn't really add much while making the game a lot more complex.

Like this more than G54 for sure, and need to bring it out more.

Coup is a nice little game to have around for the right moment. It's a fun game to show people because they will enjoy it and think it's cool. Somehow though, once people have played it many times, enjoyment declines significantly and no one wants to play anymore. It's good as a breezy opener for another game. Great game to play at a bar. More enjoyable when intoxicated because it will be easier and more fun to lie.

(After 7 plays) 10/21/16: Coup is a perfect game to throw in your bag incase someone wants to play a light game. Its portable and plays quickly. It fills a similar need as Love Letter. It seems like a blend of Resistance Avalon and Love Letter which are big hits in my group so this was a sure fit. The only downside is some games you can draw a bad hand and be out fairly quickly but that doesn't matter too much as the games are over quick anyway.

The natural evolution of the whole "secret-roles" fad. Manages to plug every hole left by the legion of Mafia clones that have risen in the later years and should still be considered the golden standard for these types of games.

I'm very impressed with this game. It feels fast and brutal. It's a micro game, not THAT Much longer than love letter. I included a bunch of decorative small stones in the game (similar to the hearts in love letter) that keep track of how many wins each player has had and that way you can keep replaying until one player has gotten 3 stones or so. Might be a good idea for everyone.

This game is interesting, brutal, plays FAIRLY well with just two players (better than love letter scales to only 2 for example) but it much better with more. You really feel like a conning manipulative government operative. There's a real sense of corruption, house of cards style and fits into the Resistance universe while still maintaining bluffing and secret identities. A great win.

Eh, it doesn't have many legs (replay value) in my opinion since its really the meta that makes the game. I actually liked Hoax more but thats not nearly as refined...but it is more wacky. Then again, a lot just depends on your group, since the meta is what makes this game. And for my group, this just fell flat on its face.

My other group likes it, but I'm just not crazy about the elimination. Same issue with Bang! The Dice Game sadly.

Coup is a simple game whose mechanics are wildly different from, and yet achieve seemingly the exact same player dynamics as, the old card game Cheat (also called Bullshit and I Doubt it). The crux is the ability to identify when other players are lying, but the game itself offers little or no factual evidence on which to make such evaluations.

11/15 - I think there are better social deduction games out there but this one is OK.  Part of the challenge with these games is getting a group that is comfortable with bluffing.  Still, it is fun when someone pulls off a nice bluff.

RATING: 8
Works great as a filler (playing a couple of rounds if needed); I often have used this when having an evening with multiple players where we decide to split up into two different groups, each playing a different game. When the first group is done, they can play Coup while waiting for the other group to finish, so we can form different groups for a next round of games. Or play it at the start of an evening, while waiting for some people to arrive.

Everyone starts out with two identities in front of them in secret.  When its their turn they can take 1 coin, take 2 coins (this may be blocked by one of the characters), stage a coup (for 7 coins, remove one persons' card from game), or use a character power.  The character power will ALWAYS go off UNLESS someone calls BS on you.  If they are right you lose a card, if they are wrong you switch your card and THEY lose a card.  Whomever has a card in front of them at the end wins.

I really am enjoying these quick interesting deduction card games like this and Love Letter.  Have to play more of this.

Coup, with the right crowd, is a really good filler game. Easy to play game in a small box, it's great to bring on the road. Yet the game has some downsides. When two players are left, there are moments (more often than you might think) where one player can't simply do anything. Also if you play with very competitive friends, the game isn't that fun in general. I usually don't like bluffing games and this is one of them. It's just me but what can you do?

Note: This game has been played several times before I started logging plays.

Once only 2 or 3 players remain, Coup becomes an interesting chess-like game with a healthy dose of politicking. But until that point it is far too random and chaotic. The trouble is that a social deduction game  like this needs to offer players some substantial information about the hidden roles of their opponents. But when it comes time to dole out information, Coup is as stingy as Oliver Twist's Mr. Bumble.

Eccellente filler basato sul bluff. Un risicato mazzo di carte, un pugno di monete e si crea un gioco divertentissimo, ideale per pokeristi. E' un gioco di ruolo: ogni giocatore riceve 2 carte con rappresentato in ognuna un personaggio. Ogni personaggio ha un potere speciale (ad esempio l'assassino può ammazzare un altro giocatore); i personaggi non vanno rivelati. A turno ogni giocatore svolge un'azione, non necessariamente abbinata ad un proprio personaggio, questa avrà esito positivo se nessuno dubita della reale identità del personaggio. In caso di 'dubito' se il sospetto è fondato il giocatore scoperto dovrà eliminare un personaggio, ma attenzione, se il sospetto è infondato sarà l'accusatore a perdere una carta personaggio. Vince il giocatore che rimane con almeno una carta. Vi faccio un esempio pratico di una fase di gioco: "Sono il Duca e incasso 3 soldi, io solo il Capitano e te lo impedisco; io solo l'Assassino e ti uccido, io sono la Contessa e sfuggo la morte..." se nessuno dubita potrebbero tutti aver inventanto il personaggio ma aver ottenuto il beneficio ed averla fatta franca...  Geniale, vero?

Pulled this out for the first time tonight and never put it back. Fantastic bluffing game, so simple too. 2/4/2013

Verdict:

What I Like: Continuous boldfaced lying to your friends. A good amount of game in this box. For a filler, it's something I don't mind pulling out every now and again between games or to kill some time. It's easy to teach and quick to play (~5 min). It's inexpensive, but the components are quite good.

What I Don't Like: Lots of impossible situations can arise for particular players in a game. Kingmaking is here in spades.

I appreciate the short play time and elegant ruleset, but I'm really just not a big fan of "guess what card I have" type games, particularly when that's the whole mechanic.  It was still a fun time as we learned the ropes though (I'd still play again if offered if only because it takes 10 minutes).

Went ahead and pre-ordered on KS since it's a small box, very short play time, and includes the Resistance promos. And gave away shortly after, another play confirmed that it is not my kind of game.

I don't know why I keep going back for more Coup punishment. It gets worse with each play.

[b]Coup[/b] was traded away in a math trade 9/21/14. (Received For Sale)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Coup got Jones Theoried in favor of the much more elegant Cockroach Poker. I have talked about this comparison a lot so I will be brief. Cockroach Poker has very simple rules that allow the players to develop their own play style and meta game which makes Cockroach Poker instantly accessible to everyone. There is nothing tacked on or convoluted. 

As much as I have enjoyed Coup there is still a slight barrier to entry with people who don't game much. In fact even in one of my groups a few people really don't like the "heavier" bluffing games but love Cockroach Poker. Another major gripe I have with this game is that it can be over before it starts which isn't very exciting (and can't happen in Cockroach Poker).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Great bluffing game were the meta game develops very quickly. It doesn't take long before you start figuring out how you think other people are playing and then the accusations start flying. I really want the original version, I much prefer that art over the Resistance themed cards.[/i]

There are lots of these little bluffing games about. For me this sits in the same space as Love Letter but with more bluff and less deduction. For how light it is it seems fairly fiddly and just less elegant. I can't really see where I would choose this if Love Letter was an option.

Snagged during the Amazon Kickstarter controversy.  Glad I did.  Loved the fun, quick gameplay and bluffing.  5-player was great.  I anticipate 4 and 6-player will also be fun.  Seems like it won't be great with 3.

Fun, time-filling card game for large groups. If everyone is exhausted with Avalon, this is another bluffing/acting game that wears out quickly. I've seen this game used as "the winner of this game picks out a better game for us to play." On the plus side, I think the artwork and concept of the game are stellar.

Terrific bluffing game and I like the Renaissance setting.

On the downside the card stock is poor quality and slightly translucent so you can see the character's silhouette if there is a light source behind the player plus the reverse of the box shows detailed silvery metal coins but the game comes with plain grey plastic ones.

You can have two of the 5 characters, but because they're hidden you can say you're using the power of any one of the 5 characters. If people believe you've got that character, you get to use the power. If they don't they call you, bluff style. If you did have the character, they lose one of their characters. If they called correctly and you didn't have the character, you lose a character. If you lose your 2 characters you lose. Which means the game goes pretty correctly. The powers are mainly around taking money, as once you get to 7 money you can spend it to attempt a kill (which can be blocked by only 1 of the 5 characters). So stopping someone getting to 7 seems to be the driver for making bluff calls. So the game works, but there doesn't seem to be enough information to call someone and the game seemed to devolve more to guessing than to bluffing. Which seemed disappointing.

The game is very random and quick.  For bluffing and politics the Resistance is much better.  For quick role deduction, Love letter is better - as it feels less aggressive.

Pros:
Super quick filler for up to 6p.
Was a lot of fun initially, around 10-15 plays.

Cons:
Novelty wears off after the various strategies/bluffs have been explored.
The players decide (through choice of player elimination) who are the final 2 to fight for victory.
Oftentimes in the final face off, one player is in a lose-lose situation. Lose if playing it straight, and lose if trying to start a lie.

I've played Coup just a handful of times, but have thoroughly enjoyed it each time. It is fast-paced and easy to learn, with an impressive capacity for strategic and deceptive gameplay. Easily played in a casual or a more intense setting.

It only got 8 stars from me entirely out of personal preference. I see no flaw in the game itself, I simply prefer to be able to feel I can accumulate things within a game (ie claiming land and resources in Catan or setting myself up with a nice gun and horse in Bang), and the nature of the game just doesn't accommodate for that. It's brevity and lack of cards "in play" prevents such.

That being said, it is an extremely fun and addicting game, and although I do not own it, I would very much enjoy if I did.

4 Plays - The bluffing unfortunately wasn't as interesting as I thought it might be. When it comes down to 2 players there's not much depth to the choices open to you. It's also very much a 'king-making' game where it's common for a third party to determine the winner just prior to being eliminated themselves.

RATING: 5.5
Very simple and quick game, although unlike one of their other games, The Resistance, there is very little discussion and it almost plays too quickly where you have very little to do. Simply take an action and if it does not correspond to one of the cards you have others can call your bluff. Whoever is wrong loses a character. Characters can also get assassinated or killed by coup. Whoever is last to stand wins. It is short and sometimes conversational, but overall just a quick filler of which there are much better ones.

RATING: 7
I've actually played this a lot (just not logged all the plays on BGG) and I've come to really like the meta game that it builds up. It can be brutal for new players and it is quite a change from most games since you can be eliminated very quickly if you're unlucky, or make a bad call.

It is a great thrill to win a round by calling people correctly while bluffing yourself and so short that if you do get eliminated its not long before you get another game in.

Despite being in The Resistance's universe, this plays completely differently.  The active bluffing mechanism is fun and tends to lead to pretty raucous tables.  It's a bit too random, but the game goes fast, and there's almost always an interesting choice to be made.  I definitely prefer it to The Resistance for small player counts.

This is a hidden role card game with a very small deck, a lot like Love Letter.  This one is all about lying, though.  You announce that you are one of the roles in the game, and then perform its ability.  Someone can accuse you of lying, at which point you can reveal that one of your two cards is that role, or be eliminated.  There's also a small economic component to the game that allows you to eliminate someone who doesn't lie--this prevents the game from stalling out.  I'd feel better about this game if the Duke role wasn't so powerful--it seems like obviously the best role, so it really helps if you can use it without lying.

RATING: 6.5
So Duke, Duke, Duke and Duke we met again...

While the Duke is probably overpowered it doesnt really matter in this game because the gameplay more about the metagame then the game mechanics in this short fun filler. 

With that said, I wonder if there should have been a role which prevents the Duke "claim coins" action. Also once a player is down to just one role card it is hard to recover. I wonder if there should be a rule to help in this situation which would allow a player to pay a coin to swap out his/her one remaining role card. Perhaps players with 2 remaining cards must be targeted for a coup before elimating a player with just one.

Played with its Reformation expansion.

Fun bluffing game similar to Shadow Hunters, Resistance, etc.

The game boiled down to seeing whether people were lying.  Too many people, having two cards each, and too many actions/card exchanges caused the game to be a little chaotic in the trying to figure out who was whom.  It seemed more of a race to get seven coins to coup someone.

Overall, an okay game, however I'd pick The Resistance or Shadow Hunters every time due to the less chaotic nature of role changing.

This is a quick filler game about bluffing your way to victory.  Each player starts out with 2 cards with secret identities.  On your turn, you announce your character and take its action.  Be careful....if you are caught lying, you will have to discard that card.  The last person with a card wins.  Quick, light fun for those who like to bluff.

Excited by the Kickstarter buzz and enjoying The Resistance game, I decided to kick start my Kickstarter career. Pleased with my Kickstarter experience, I will focus the review on the game. So who doesn't love The Resistance? I always add a bit of plot behind The Resistance and in my world Mini Coopers have become the car of choice making BMW the must powerful company in the world. Now everyone has at least two Minis and the market is saturated. The anti-mini resistance have discovered that due to this saturation of the market, BMW would like to start again from ground zero and plan to destroy the mini utopia, to sell more cars. What has got this to do with the game nothing, but it is more fun to write this yarn then play Coup the game.

Didn't make the cut- as it is not a very interesting game, just an interesting idea jumping on the bandwagon of bluff games.

Such a wonderful game. whole group loves it! Some character combinations are better than others, however you can lie. So if you're stuck with awful cards in the beginning, just lie and say your the ambassador. It's hard to call someone on that, because the punishment for being wrong is pretty harsh. Still have to figure this game out a little bit, but so far I found every single game that got published by Indie Boards and games amazing, big thumbs up for them.

Yet another over rated game... It is nice and entertaining at first - with the lying and the guessing. But when you analyze the odds, its really just a guessing game: does your opponent have the card he claims to have or not? Sooner or later you will have to blindly guess. I mean -guess- since there are 3 copies of each card and you will most likely never end up in a situation where you could truly deduce the cards your opponents have (unlike Love letter for example). And if you do, it will probably won't change much of the outcome: since everyone has 2 influence cards (lives), you will be out of the game before you know it.

The second play brought into focus the importance of watching the money, as a coup with 7 coins is unavoidable and quite an aggressive move. Also I feel that the game benefits from a regular group/play so that the role effects are ingrained and so less likely to slip up with seemingly tell tale lying. 

I can see newbies floundering among veterans because the former needs to grasp not only the game mechanics but also the metagame involved with the roles and how to best play or convincingly lie your way forward. So unless new players are willing to get over the hurdle of being easy targets and sitting out, then it is an interesting social game. Not a fan of the sci-fi branding, more interested in the political setting of G54. However as an introduction to hidden roles, I suspect Samurai Sword will be more accessible or if bluffing is more the groups thing then Cockroach Poker will be best suitable.

-This game is fun to play with 4-6, when you get into the lower numbers 2&3 you start to deal with just guessing hoping you hit. Still is a fun game though

Minimalistic mini-game.  The mechanic of the game is interesting and despite the minimalistic set of rules, it is still possible to have a "strategy".  That said, there are so few moving parts that the game feels a bit "limiting" and somehow repetitive.

Still kudos to the designers for having achieved a good result with a ridiculously small amount of rules and characters.

This was the London on Board gang's surprise hit of Essen 2012, and it's another minimalist gem, outdoing Love Letter with just 15 cards! The basic schtick is that it's a secret role game where you don't actually have to have the role to use it, you can just lie!

There are three cards for each of five roles, and every player is dealt two cards. On your turn you take one of the actions associated with one of the roles, whether or not you actually have the matching card. Certain roles can also be used to counter someone else's action. So for example, I might say "I use my Captain to extort two of your money" and then my opponent says "Aha, but I use my Ambassador to block your Captain".

At any time, anyone can call bullshit on any role claim. The called player has to show the role if they have it (and they then shuffle it into the deck and draw a new one). The loser of the call loses one of their cards and has to play on with a hand size of one. If you lose another life, you're eliminated. Last man standing wins - the whole thing lasts under 15 minutes. It's also amazingly well produced for a first-time self-publisher. Good card stock, nice art, very clear rules.

Very fast once everyone knows what the five roles do. Pretty easy to teach, but it may take a few quick rounds before new players get comfortable. It has that "one more play" feel and you can go through enough rounds that several people get to win and the player elimination is no big deal.
I like it better than other bluffing games I've played (like The Resistance) because there's a bit more to the mechanics. For instance, there are general strategies to learn and use, like: if you have one card left and someone tries to assassinate you, you should always call their bluff because you have nothing to lose if it turns out that they aren't bluffing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast integrated bluffing game. Good light-hearted fun as we bluff our way around the table. The tension builds quickly as players gather enough coins for a sure thing coup. Eventually a chain reaction of player eliminations occur and the game comes to a swift conclusion. Perfect for a light filler or as a game night ender (leave as your last character is eliminated).

7 - The game, like resistance, feels too short.  Otherwise it's good.  It's a serious bluffing game and requires a lot of deduction, but by the time you have figured out what someone has either you've been executed or they have swapped cards due to someone else guessing incorrectly and they have new cards.  I'd like to see a variants with kill counts instead of ditching influence cards to keep the game moving longer.

Nothing I am ever going to play again. Yuck! Was initially a 3 but on reflection there is nothing here but guessing, and not even fun guessing. Twice (in 4 tries, can't really call them games), I had duplicates of the 3 cards in the deck. Each time another player (3-player games) said he had THAT character. Of course I challenged.. and lost both times. Probability was about 4:1 on my side but I lost anyway; guessing is just guessing.

Gawd!! Forced to play 2 more times. What utter crap!

One of my favourite card games, but I think the need for a lot of players limits is play. I would never knock back a game regardless of player count, but I definitely think four players is the absolute minimum. Personally if I have 5+ players I would play Coup. Less than 5 I would rather play Love Letter. For some reason my 8 year old daughter likes it even with 2 players, but I think she would be in the minority. I also think she should be in the minority for 8 years actually requesting to play this game (she has played a LOT of love letter before she tried Coup).

Perfectly OK social deduction game that came out a few years ago. I prefer The Resistance if we're getting deeply into that genre, but Coup isn't that bad. I never owned it because it was already accounted for in my group at least once, and who else was I going to play with? Even after a few plays, we did have the standard "three Duke" opener that people have since complained about, but it takes like ten minutes to play this, so it's not a terrible blemish or anything.

Quite an interesting "Alternative" to The Resistance or other "hidden identity" games in the same vain. Yet, I found this to be quite hard to get into. Maybe because it takes quite a few plays to learn all the roles by heart, but remembering who claimed to be what and when the players swapped their (alleged) roles through the ambassador is not as easy at it sounds. Still, I am curious to see how the experience might change once I play it a few more times, but for now, I would prefer The Resistance or Werewolf. Also, I found that more than once, there was only one choice left ( and one possible winner left) in the game, something I dont really like in games.

Aaah Coup. I used to love this game, but I'm afraid it got played to utter death. There was a time I went to SoCal to visit my cousins/aunts/uncles/etc. and the cousin I was rooming with wanted to play this whenever we had free time (which we had a lot of). I played a ton of this 1v1 (which is super intense oh my freaking god), and a lot with my friends over the summer. People got really darn good at bluffing, I feel like I was really focused, but overall the game didn't have enough depth. I just played this way too many times. Props to Indie Boarda and Cards for bringing out yet another game that has a ton of replay value though :) 

I'd still gladly play this again (preferably with a different group), but it just doesn't have nearly the same appeal as before.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game! Great for gamers and non-gamers alike. Plays through much like poker, with each hand taking only a few minutes. 4-5 players is perfect, but have had loads of fun with 3 up to 9 players. It's quick to learn, quick to explain to new players, and quick to play. The only problem I have is that my friends want to play it and The Resistance as the only games they play all night. I'd rather it be a filler, but they'd rather it be the meal. So I'm almost hesitant to bring it out because I know it'll be on the table for 2-3 hours, and while I love it, I don't want to play it for that long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Feels very similar to Love Letter. The big difference here is that there's actually a learning curve! Players have to understand how all the roles interact with each other to play competently. So players need several games before the game becomes entertaining. Although Coup games are short, these initial games are often not appealing enough to lure players to try it multiple times.

If you are good at this game you will be a target to everyone. The result of this is going to be long waiting periods in between games which is no fun. Enjoy this as a late night drinking game with 5+ players

A simple game of limited bluffing that works as a light opener to something else.  
The gameplay here isn't particularly deep or thoughtful, and once you've played a couple rounds the game grows quite stale.  
If you want more than a breezy twenty minute social game, you may want to look elsewhere.

That said, the expansion Coup: Reformation, makes this game MUCH more interesting.

Like this game, but it is a bit cumbersome to teach to folks as it takes a while to start taking actions naturally.

Bullshit meets character actions. The game is relatively quick and forces you to keep your head in the game in order to better bluff your opponents. The game is more enjoyable if the players inherently understand how the different character roles interact and play off each other.

For me, an unexpected gem. I'm not a huge fan of party/bluffing games, but this one hit the sweet spot. It's simple and fast, but allows for some clever play. You need to know all the characters and their abilities to do well (which means the game starts to shine after several plays), but there aren't many, so that's not a huge problem. With a bunch of experienced players, it really is a crazy ride with lots of tension and many hilarious moments. An amazing filler, each game is about 10 minutes well spent. And when you're done, you want to try again!

Always happy to play quick fire bluffing games. This is a good one, even though after five rapid games in a row I didn't feel a desperate urge to play again. It seems like if you're unlucky enough to be the first to lose a character, you're in big trouble. And there's not as much bluffing as I'd like. But it's clever, especially as it only has a handful of cards.

A nice addition to the micro-card game genre. It's like Love Letter and Mascarade had a baby. Definitely best played with players who are willing to bluff and take chances, or at least form temporary alliances. Coup will quickly grow boring if everyone plays it safe. One other complaint- it seems the final few turns each game usually play themselves out. Unless there is an assassin in play, it usually comes down to whoever had the most money before the showdown began.

Fun bluffing game.  You don't assume a role in this game (like The Resistance), you have two cards in front of you which give you two 'special powers.'

Your cards are not known to the other players, so you can claim 'special powers' that you don't actually have.  If someone challenges you and you are bluffing, you have to turn one if your cards face up (if you weren't bluffing, then the challenger needs to turn a card face up).  If both your cards are face up, you lose that round....so don't bluff too much!

Recommended.  Only downside is there is a little bit of a barrier to entry.  It'll take a game or two to get a feel for how to effectively play the game.  But I suppose that is par for an hidden role game.

It works good as a filler, it's very easy to learn, and it's fairly accessible. People who have a hard time bluffing might be turned off though.

EDIT: I take back what I said about no strategy. There is actually a decent bit of strategy. The same way Texas Hold'm has strategy.

A comment was made about this game that resonated with me.  Something along the lines of "I feel like I'm just about to do something meaningful in this game and it's already over."

It's too easy to find yourself in an situation that is a guaranteed loss (assuming your opponent isn't a retard).  Even though the game is quick it's still a broken mechanic, imo.

Initially loved this game, but slowly realized that for a game that has bluffing as its main mechanism, it is way too punishing when you catch people in their lies. So a lot of the game, especially towards the end, becomes just trying to do the best you can with the cards you are dealt. 

Mascarade and One Night Ultimate Werewolf have kinda dethroned this one for me. Let's see what happens with the expansion, I love team games.

(08/13/2014) - I had read a little bit about Coup previously, but had never had a chance to play with. I picked it up for the wedding weekend as a light title that accommodates a variety of player counts.

(09/21/2014) - [7] - All things considered, Coup is a decent game. It really needs a relatively high number of players to shine. Less than four players, this game is a 4 out of 10. More than that and I would put it closer to an 8 or 9.

(09/11/2015) - [8.5] - I find my enjoyment of Coup to be very dependent on both group size and group chemistry. A small number of players diminishes the experience, but a larger group without much chemistry is equally detrimental. With at least four to five friends playing together, you're easily looking at a 9 ranking. Otherwise things sag to a 7 or so.

There's a lot to like about this game. It's simple to play, plays quickly, and has a lot of depth of decision making. The social deduction and attempts to get away with lying in order to perform better actions works great. They can  call your bluff. More interesting to me is claiming to have the character that will block your action and put the decision back on you to decide if you should believe them or not! I like how there's some information about who people could have and by using the architect and drawing cards you can know even more about what cards can't be in people's hands. As people lose influence, more and more information is known and bluffing becomes riskier. This is a Love Letter killer for me.

Coup is a clever little bluffing game. It has a self-regulating mechanic which stops anyone getting into a runaway lead - other players will just gang up on anyone doing "too well".

Games are quick enough that the player elimination element isn't too annoying. 

I find it's only worth playing in larger groups though. Smaller games lose a lot of the intricacy and strategy. 

Something I'd play between better games, rather than being a go-to game, really.

Coup is a rather fun, light, filler bluffing game. A strange combination to be sure, but it works very well. Suffers from the same "problem" as its predecessor (The Resistance) - too much mechanics designed around bluffing.

not as good a party game as some of my friends think. you really need a table to hold coins and such out where people can see. it's less random and silly than One Night Ultimate Werewolf and even more strongly depends on a balance of players who can bluff and don't hold a grudge. player elimination and grudges don't mix if the game drags on. luck of the draw will itch anyone who thought they would be able to perpetrate some serious, devious strategies. might be fun to play in lieu of poker, but i don't much care for poker. i'll play this again if someone insists, but i won't buy or recommend it.

Everyone's favourite bluffing game that comes with many problems.
First: it tends to stall with 3 player endings when every player can elliminate any other player but then will be elliminated themselves on next turn by third player. There are rules that prevent stalling forever so it ends with unsatisfactory kingmake-ish finish when one player eventually is forced to chose winner among others.
Second: punishment for called bluff or wrongly accusing someone in bluffing is severe and the gain is usually not that big, so you actually better off not bluffing for the most part, which kinda defeats premise of a bluffing game.
Third: calling out bluffs for non-targetted actions is not motivated at all. In best case scenario you hurt one player, which helps your other opponents. In worst case you hurt yourself. Vigilance isn't rewarded, which also feels off to me.
Fourth: player ellimination. Yeah, it's a quick filler and all that, but you are still going to miss on actually playing the game occasionally.
Nevertheless it's still a fun game and I'll still play it. But if choice is mine to make, I'd pick Mascarade instead.

14-03-2014. I owned Coup for a while now ( at least 6 months) and played it quite a bit as a filler. It's a nice elimination game, in which you can lie and steal from other players and pretend you have a role that you really don't. If someone calls you out, you lose one card. Lose two cards and you're out of the game. Quick and fun bluffing game.

Our group really enjoyed this game!  You can get by in this game without bluffing at all (for those people who don't like it or are not good at it) and if you want to bluff, there is plenty of opportunities.  It is much more light-hearted than The Resistance so I think it is less likely to create frienemies even after the game ends**. It requires few people to play and the games are pretty quick.  

The thing I did not like was playing it too many times in a row.  We played 4 or 5 games in a row (since it was so quick) and I was pretty bored by the last one.  Perhaps the expansion adds more interest?

**The difference between The Resistance and Coup:  In The Resistance, you have to lie/convince people to their face using words and tactics.  When something goes bad, there is no way to tell who it was.  It creates a high amount of distrust and backstabbing.  In Coup you carry out an action that everyone sees.  These actions can imply that you are a particular character(you don't have to say anything) and others make inferences based on your actions and the statistics of what is in play to decide whether or not you are bluffing.  In other words, in The Resistance you tell lies and in Coup you bluff (like poker).  Coup is a lot less confrontational but it can cause more revenge plays (because you know who did what).

This game is a fast card game that last only 15 minutes at the most.  you have 2 cards which represent your roles however you can lie about which roles you have to get an advantage in the game. If you are caught lying or you accuse another player of lying when they are telling the truth you lose one of your roles. the last player with a role is the winner.

My first few months with Coup were revelatory, the first short game I had really enjoyed in years. After several years my enthusiasm has waned significantly. There are a lot of really fun considerations to be made here, but I feel like there are two big problems with the design. First of all, I feel like it is altogether too rewarding for people who don't bluff at all. Secondly, the game really loses steam in the final turns, as play becomes more analytical and less ambiguous. That feels like the opposite of what the arc should be.

I sometimes wonder if Coup's success  is owing to it playing a little like a game of hidden information for people who don't like hidden information in the first place. For me it was a fun honeymoon, but I don't feel like I need to play again.

Bluffing party game.  Plays best with 3 to 5.  if you have more play resistance.

A fairly simple and insanely quick bluffing game in a similar vein as Love Letter. The poker-like bluffing is pretty cool if you can pull it off, but I think the game needs more players for it to really work well. It's perfect for a filler as it's much shorter than Love Letter, due to the fact that you only play one round to declare a winner. Good game.

Settled in the world of "The Resistance" this game rocks! The advantage compared to "The Resistance" or "Avalon" is that you can play it with less than 5 people ... a gladly seen alternative. A lot of bluffing and laughing happens through the game. Very nice short jewel!

A couple hundred games of this, and it's gotten a little stale. Rebellion/Guatemala 1954 fixes this by having a ton more role variety.

When there's five or six players, well, that's too many for Love Letter, so Coup is a great little game to bring to the table if you have ten minutes to spare. Lots of bluffing and goading, this one really shines with parents, grandparents, infrequent gamers and seasoned gamers alike.

Once you've got a few plays under the belt you'll find you can read so much information by the actions or counteractions (or lack thereof), that players take. Inevitably as players reel off abilities, an Ambassador swap or two reveals a bit more information and money becomes stockpiled, players break one by one and the challenges come thick and fast as more and more information is revealed. Character reveals can be a hoot as you find out what some players have been up to.

Good fun and it's over in less than ten minutes. It's always tempting to play just one more round. Plays best with five or six, partly because more cards out results in a little more finesse in the deduction department.

This one fell incredibly flat for our first 5 plays.  I'll try it again with another group, but I was extremely disappointed.  In no way will this replace Love letter as my quick game of choice, nor will it replace The Resistance as my bluffing game of choice.  Love letter is much more streamlined, and the resistance is a much more exciting and fun game.  

Don't believe the hype.

Not for me. The best strategy is probably just to keep as low a profile as possible and hope that no one notices you. Add in the player elimination and all I can say is please leave me out of it. One of very few games I ever played where I cared more for it to be over than actually trying to win.

A nice little filler game, but almost too short. It feels like as soon as you set the game up, it's almost over. Definitely likely to be better with larger groups.

UPDATE: I have to admit that after playing this with larger groups (4+) I'm enjoying it much more. I might even add the new expansion to my wishlist. Upgraded from a 6.5 to a 7 (which is a huge difference for me)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The initial play in the game is fine but the outcome often comes down to both players knowing who's going to win because one can't call the other's bluff without self destructing for the loss anyway.

Interesting for a bit but that lacklustre finish of some plays disappoints.

Coup fits a rare niche: the quick 5- or 6-player game. Though turns go so quickly that I wish I had more time to think (but hesitation can be a giveaway). The essence of the BS or Liar's Dice game in a very pure, quick-playing form.

End-game with 2-3 people feels clunky compared to the rest of the game. Seems like with 3, first to make a move loses, while with 2, there's a set menu of end-game options to take, and both involve foresight and preparation beforehand.

Cool wow factor on first play, but I don't generally have patience for ultra-quick 'mini-games' (Poker, Werewolf, The Resistance etc) that are more interesting over several rounds where you get a better feel for player tendency (and track wins / winnings).

Challenging seems underpowered since if I Challenge, that gives a really strong signal that I have that role (and more information) but I can't bluff a Challenge either since the penalty is prohibitive. But then if everybody thinks this way, Challenging becomes less predictable/risky... I suppose the game milks its replayability here. Challenge is helped by Ambassador, but is still too weak on the first round. Some foreknowledge would help but difficult to implement that without knowing too much (challenge needs to be a little weaker than bluffing), with how discrete knowledge is in the game.

This is fun. 

Some similarities to Love Letter, but also to the whole Werewolf family of games, maybe it's a bit in between. Surely far more creativity, openness than in LL. And more lying through your teeth. The trick however is that it takes a creative mind to be able to lie within realm of believability. And here's where it's at. One must understand the game system, the logic behind it and the players. Probably a grower.

Played one 6P game. Coup has some interesting ideas, like having roles having attached to the 'lives' you have. There's not really much to work with at the start, so the first part of the game feels like it boils down to lucky stabs in the dark. It does get more interesting as the game progresses though, although ultimately it isn't as streamlined as other bluffing games out there.

Lying, guessing, and getting lucky all within 10 minutes.  The game has great player interaction and is quick and fast paced.  

The downside would be if you can't handle randomness, luck, and potentially getting ganged up on.  What you draw initially will determine a lot of the game.  Still, for how short it is I think it is fine.  This is just not a game that I want to play too much at once because I think it could overstay its welcome.

There are some games that are long and complicated. And glorious. You play them a few times, trying out a few strategies, eventually internalising the rules, then you move on to the next one.

Then there is Coup. Minimal rules, can be played a half dozen times in a session. And it is glorious.

We play Coup lots. I don't know much about your Coup. I know more than I should ever know about my Coup. We have played so often we are in each others heads.

Terminology and catch phrases fly freely "lay low", "filthy lay low", "Lincoln is a filthy lay low", "sleeper duke", "double contessa", "duke captain", " foreign aid", "me? You are assassinating me??? Why??...contessa", "checks out", "he's consistent", "too big a threat", "best player", "table balance", "too much information", "ruined my deck" etc etc and etc.

This game is like Survivor but in tight little iterations so you can tweak and retweak your strategy multiple times a day. It is everything a short game should be. A masterpiece.

Az általam próbált partijátékok közül ezt éreztem egyértelműen a leggyengébbnek. Nálam sem az Avalont, sem a Mascaradét meg sem közelíti. Simán elveszek két pénzt és utána ölök. Nem éri meg blöffölni, mert úgy is lebukik az ember. Ha valaki 2 perc alatt kiesik várhatja a játék végét. Ivós társaságban talán működhet, de szerintem máshol nem igazán. Nagyon nem jött be.

Too many (read: all) games come down to multiplayer Kingmaker situations for my tastes. And what's worse, in these end game scenarios all bluffing usually goes out the window -- there's usually a set of roles you MUST claim to win, and by extension your opponent MUST challenge.

Great idea, but not a good design.

Lighter than Resistance, fits a better range of people, but much more quick and aggressive and harder to get on top and stay there. Harder to bluff as well, but very dangerous to call someone's bluff.

RATING: 7
This is the first modern board game I bought and I have played it with many different groups. This game is quick and very fun if the players in the group are willing to bluff.

Since each player only have 2 Influences, calling a bluff is very risky. As soon as you know some players will never lie, there's no incentive to challenge anyone because 99% of time, you'll lose the challenge. Then the game dwindles into whoever has the best cards win, which is very boring. This is the major design flaw of Coup - Not enough incentive to lie to gain an advantage.

If played with the right group though, it's extremely fun. I have had very fun time playing this game.

Similar to Love Letter but with less deduction and more lying. Because you don't need the card you claim to have in order to use its ability, much lying and calling out friends for lying results. Unfortunately, more often than not the end game devolves into a transparent king-making scenario. One Night Ultimate Werewolf is better.

Kind of a combination of Poker/Liar's Dice and Love Letter. It's pretty fun for a bluffing game, which I don't typically enjoy all that much. But this is REALLY quick! I kinda want to play it again!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The deck (15 cards?) has multiple (3?) copies of each card. Cards are various roles, each associated with a unique power (take money from bank, from another player, kill another person or cancel their power, etc.). Players are dealt 2 at start of game. On your turn, claim to be ANY role and take it's action OR take money from the bank. Anyone can claim you're not actually the role you claimed: if you reveal that you are, they lose a card (and you draw a replacement); otherwise you do. OR, you may spend 7 money to kill one of a player's cards. If anyone loses both their cards, they're out for the rest of the game -- last remaining player wins!

[b]--- Game of Thrones version ---[/b]
You are the head of a great House. You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other Houses, forcing them into exile. Only one House will survive...

In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.

Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence – i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:

Master of Coin: Take 3 coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking the Royal Grant.
Assassin: Pay 3 coins and try to assassinate another player's character.
Red Priestess: Block an assassination attempt against you.
Smuggler: Take 2 coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.
Tactician: Draw 2 character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return 2. Block someone from stealing coins from you.

On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of 3 other actions:

Income: Take one coin from the treasury.
Royal Grant: Take two coins from the treasury.
Coup: Pay 7 coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have 10+ coins, you must take this action.)

When you take one of the character actions – whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action – that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.

If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.

The last player to still have influence – that is, a face-down character – wins the game!

RATING: 4
I like hidden role games when the hidden role mechanic is supplementary to the rest of a good game.  I think when the game IS just hidden roles it often falls flat for me.  Hence I'm not a fan of The Resistance or almost any flavor of Werewolf and this game also falls in that camp.

Each player starts with two hidden roles that have special abilities and each turn players take actions with those characters.  The catch is that a player can claim and take an action with a character they don't have.  The further catch is if you are called out and caught lying you lose one of your characters.  When you lose two you're out and last man standing wins.

There are a couple big problems with this game that I noticed in my first play.  First of all, this game is supposed to be interesting by bluffing and taking advantage of abilities you don't have BUT in my game the players who didn't lie made it to the end since other pleyers would challenge them and knock themselves out.  Also, not challenging and playing it safe also rules out making it even less interesting.  Why risk a character when you have no real way of knowing whether a player is lying or not.  And that's another big problem with this game, there's no way to actually know if someone is lying or not.  Finally, the game is often determined well before the end of the game when everyone does know what each other has and one player has a better hand than another.

It is small, easy to teach, and plays pretty quickly so it has some small value as a filler but there are better fillers and these kinds of games simply aren't for me.

Because of the speed of this game, I think I've played more Coup than any other game on this list.  Coup is part of the Dystopian Universe, in which The Resistance is also set.  A lot of fun can come from these 15 cards with 5 types of "influences" (the vanilla version without the Reformation expansion, that is).  You start each game with two cards which can be any of five types (Dukes, Captains, Ambassadors, Contessas, or Assassins) and two coins.  The game is all about knowing when to bluff and when to challenge.  Warning:  there is an app for the game, but it cannot capture the face-to-face bluffing spirit that is central to the game (also the app doesn't allow you to draw Foreign Aid).  Get the hard copy of this one, and you won't be disappointed.

I would give this a 6.5. Not sure why people like this so much, but I really don't enjoy the random killing. This game can easily become political and you can get into fights with friends/family you are playing with if people take it offensively. Also it's had to win even if you have good strategy. Basically, if you are playing in a large group, if you stay quiet, usually you are safe until the end. So even if you are smart, it doesn't mean you could win...

I have played probably twenty or more games so farthis weekend alone with kids of all ages, nongamers, and casual gamers. the kids played a dozen or more games before I got to the lodge and more between sets of plays with me. Thursday at GameScape North several games were played with this copy after i left to play another game. After a week and a half, this copy has seen over half a hundred plays, and the sixteen cards are starting to come apart. :) THAT is a testament to what a great game this is. I will sleeve these until a new printing becomes available, but i will have no problem buying a another copy of this game.

As the rating says, I'm usually in the mood to play this.  I think if I played it too much though, my rating would go down, as the gameplay grows a bit stale with too many plays.  Veteran players are quick to pick up on dominant strategies, and being caught with the wrong personality cards at the start could cost you the game.  Still, this game is fantastic with the right crowd, and each round is so quick - so who can complain?

I don't mind bluffing in games, but with some structure or context. In this game, it's a little too wild and open for my taste. 
You make your decision with little information so this can only be enjoyable to play with people you know well (to bring out the "social experiment" part of the game). Otherwise, very little appeal outside a subset of specific people (extrovert?).

This is an okay addition to the rapidly expanding family of "hidden role" games.  In its favour, it's very easy to learn and plays very quickly.  To its detriment, the art and production values are slightly below average.  Though the theme hardly matters in a game like this, it seems clear from the names of the roles and their associated abilities that this game was designed to be in a medieval or Renaissance setting, yet a weird, futuristic sci-fi setting with slightly bizarre artwork was chosen instead.  To be fair, hardly any time is spent actually looking at the cards, but to me that just means that something not dreadfully boring could have been done with the back of the cards.  But what does that have to do with the actual game?  Not much.  As with most games of this type, my biggest concern is that too much time is spent making "educated guesses" rather than cleverly deducing solid information.  I'd rather play poker.  Game design: 2.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 4.5/10

Coup + Reformation Expansion in 1 box. All from Kickstarter. (1 play).

Probably a lot of fun for those that take the time to learn all the card abilities well enough to bluff properly. But my playgroup doesn't really want to play this kind of game enough to make it good. So sadly, it's not for me.

I also like the idea behind the Reformation expansion, but it playing it with inexperienced players just seemed to muddy the water for everyone.

Each player has two face down cards, each of which is both a hit-point and provides a special power. The trick: you are allowed to lie, but you take a hit if someone calls your bluff.

Hoax, although some 30 years older, is the better game, though.

Quick playing bluffer with too much guesswork. Players are given two role cards, each with their own powers e.g. the Duke allows you to obtain money, the Assassin allows you to kill one of your opponents' roles, the Contessa allows you to block the Assassin etc, and they all interact with one of the other roles in some way. Each player then attempts to carry out an action by claiming to have one of the role cards. If they go unchallenged, then they are successful (whether they possess the role card or not). If they are challenged and do not posses the card then they lose one of their other cards. If they are challenged and they reveal that they are in possession of the role, then the challenged loses one of their cards. Whoever is the last person with cards remaining wins. This can prove to be a fun game but overall you can't escape the feeling that you are just guessing whether your opponents are bluffing or not, although for a game that generally lasts no more than 10 minutes it's difficult to judge it too harshly.

I'm not entirely a fan of The Resistence, I'm more of a board/pieces/cards/victory points type of person.  Bluffing games are fun, but when playing a game of that caliber, unless you REALLY know the other players, there is little chance that the spies won't win.

So I figured I'd try Coup.  I'd heard it was similar, but with somewhat more structure, akin to Love Letter.  It's a fun game, but gameplay is somewhat limited.  If a player gets a 2 good characters and is honest through the whole game, never calls anyone out, it can be pretty easy to win.  All in all, a good one to pull out now and then, but not an "everyday" game.

A tightly composed competition. The hidden role game in one of it's more precise incarnations.

It's fun, quick and elegant. I haven't played it enough to speak to long-term balance but the bluffing element makes it a very social game and thus quite changeable form one group to another.

Much like Tokaido it is a game that very quickly becomes one of math rather than theme, but also like Tokaido the lightness of that theme prevents this from being a conflict of interest. The game embraces calculation and is a fantastic way to spend time.

Oh, my, goodness. This game is so great. And you and your friends are going to lose all the trust you previously had in each other. This is the ultimate backstabbing game. And it's so horribly fun! And it takes less than 120 seconds to explain it, which ain't a secondary thing when you want to suggest to play it to your friends. Just avoid suggesting it to people whose trust and friendship can be fickle.

A very quick and fun hidden role/bluffing game. The first few plays suffer from an unfamiliarity with the roles, but subsequent plays increase the level of enjoyment quite a bit. I've seen some groups play this quite seriously and others treat it as a light filler. I'm in the camp that thinks this game is not interesting enough to last 10-15 minutes a game, and I also find other fillers more enjoyable (so I sold it).

I've played this several times now, I don't get it. So you can bluff different actions and you may or may not get called out on them, and in the end it comes down to counting what's left, and making a calculated risk on whether or not to call someone's bluff or rebluff a different role on your own.

Much better with 5 or 6, I wouldn't play it with less, too many cards stuck in the middle.

I'd play it, but only cuz it's super fast, I'm not going to ask for this to be played.

Wydawca mówi nam, że można zagrać już we dwie osoby ale to chyba żart, 3 osoby to absolutne minimum. „Światowy konflikt” to dobra, szybka, gra imprezowa na 1-3 rozdania. Polecam 6/10.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is considered a micro-game due to its size and playtime.  A round can reasonably be played by a group of 6 people in 15-20 minutes.  Man this game is good!  Coup is a bluffing game where you are trying to knock out the other players.  The game allows you to bluff and counterbluff to other players in a seamless and straightforward way.  The cards allow for plenty of complexity into how you play your bluff, which may intimidate people who don't play games on their first play.  The game mitigates this very nicely by including player helper cards which detail plainly what each card can do.  I love this game!  Every non-gamer I have played this with has been able to pick up the game quickly, while every gamer I have played with love the interactions and depth.  I'd also say that most non-gamers I have played with acclimate to bluffing games more naturally than most other styles of games.  I highly recommend this little game!

For such a short game, this one packs in a lot. Of all the "micro" bluffing games, this one is my favorite. From such a simple set of rules, and over the course of a very short play-time, there develops a persistent sense of paranoia and urgency. If the game were any longer, I'd either feel bored, or I'd have to quit playing lest all the tension drive me bonkers.

To start the game, everyone gets two cards (just two!) from a short deck. You also take two coins. From there, you can choose an action. The trick is that the action you choose can be based on one of the two cards you are holding -- or not. You can lie, and you'll probably have to if you want to win. No on else can see what you're holding, but if they think you're up to something sneaking, they can call you out on your bluff (or is it?!). Once challenged, you must flip a card over. If you were telling the truth, then the other player is out of luck and must discard a card of his own -- playing the rest of the game a card down. If you were lying, then it's you who lose a card. Play continues around the table like this until everyone but one has lost both of their cards. Last person standing wins the game.

Simple enough, but from that simple premise, along with a working knowledge of what all the cards do, a rich play experience emerges. No game last more than 10-15 minutes, so it's impossible to get a sense of long-term strategy -- there is none. Likewise, the game demands repeat plays, and not just because it's fun (it is), but rather you'll want to give everyone a chance to memorize the various special abilities of each card. Nothing gives away the lie more than an overly long pause as you reference the card in front of you. For all that, however, when the game gets humming, there exists a sense of ominous paranoia. My win rate is terrible, but so is everyone else's. The fact of the matter is that Coup creates a feeling of always being on the brink of loss. Your position can fall apart so quickly, that those fears are justified. And yet, when you win, probably because of all the tension, it feels like an accomplishment each and every time. For such a small and short game, that's something worth experiencing.

The game can devolve as players drop out, and an early elimination can feel arbitrary. However, both of these issues can be accounted for with experience. As with any game that involve lying, losing can feel like a personal affront, but that's where the fun is!

I think the bluffing in Coup is among the best of the hidden role games.  But, the overall mechanism of saving up money and attacking a single person doesn't work well.  It's just an arms race full of king making.  I might like it better with 2 or 3.  Only played with 5 or 6 so far.

Like the game, never get to play it. Social deduction games just don't quite do it for me. That said, it is a fun, decent game especially for how fast it can play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
Coup is best with probably four experienced players who are all just on fire with the bluffing. Quick bluffs and quick games don't offer the depth that larger social deduction games do, but it fits it's niche well. Reminiscent in ways of Poker, but faster and more fun and doesn't require you to bet your life savings to get a bit of a kick from it. There is more skill in this than people might initially realise, and while some roles may seem more powerful than others, not always - and essentially, you have all roles available to you; it's just knowing when, where, and most importantly, how to play them.

Lie, cheat, and steal to eliminate your opponents and be the last man standing. You can take any action, but if you don't have the proper card in front of you and someone calls your bluff, half of your power evaporates...

Coup G54 has completely replaced this for me. I would only play this if someone else put it on the table.

RATING: 10
Under the guise of simplicity this game reigns supreme. Playstyles are granted to you in the form of 2 Influence (character) cards however play the game you want to by bluffing and manipulating your opponents. The game times are short and  don't normally last longer then 15 minutes. I have spent countless hours playing this game with friends and  we haven't gotten bored  with it yet. the only reason this game didn't get a 10 is because it does require a certain amount of bluffing or "acting" at times which in a more conservative playgroup may not come as natural thus, watering down the game experience. This game is a great way to start an RPG adventure or slide into a good game night!

I loved Coup at first, but then went through a period of boredom with it. I've recently began enjoying it again. Maybe it's because I've been playing more longer and complex games, but I enjoy the speed of the game. And it's still complex enough to scratch that deductive itch.

Recently this game has been getting SLIGHTLY stale for me. Maybe because the people I play with typically are not taking too many risks and the turns can become fairly predictable. I am interested to see how the inquisitor (from Kickstarter) and the "factions" mechanics change things. I still look forward to playing, but I have dropped the rating accordingly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lots of good strategy in when to bluff, how to bluff, and how to fake a bluff. Its a fun game until it gets down to two people. The game is usually over before it gets down to two players, its merely a matter of realization and finding a solution to your predicament.

The Duke and Ambassador are the two best cards most of the time and its hard to beat someone who has these. The expansion changes this up a lot, I think for the better.

Exceptional game, still play it. While it doesn't quite create the tension and atmosphere of a resistance or werewolf it gets to table a lot more often because you only need 3 plus players, though it also works with 2.

Two cards, lose both and you're dead, play a basic role, or one granted by a card you have, or perhaps a card you only claim you have, in which case, claim it and hope nobody challenges you.

Midway between game and party game, there's bluffing and deduction and card counting. With 6 pllayers (much less with 5, not at all with 4) there's exhaustion of the pool and the slow reveal of who is where, but there is still a distressing amount of groupthink in who will win.

A fine bluffing game, I suppose, but way too swing-y and too easy to get eliminated. Play with 2 players remaining is a bit trivial and deterministic.

Poor man's Avalon. It's a pretty fun game, but I would always play avalon over this if I have enough players (which I don't always and that is where this thing comes in). 

The lying and deception is really fun, but sometimes it feels like it doesn't matter that much what you do during the run cause it's mainly decided by who decides to coup who. Lately Spyfall has replaced this for me when I have 4-5 players. This is still the best though when you are only three players.

Update: I actually prefer this to Avalon now, and it gets more plays. It's best with 4 players, and ditch the team element. Stick with the Inquisitor cards though.

Coup is a very simple game.  You have two cards.  On your turn you either take one of a couple of basic actions, or you claim that you jave a certain role card and take the associated action (whether you have it or not).  Most of the actions involve getting/stealing money.  There's an action that lets you force people to throw away one of their two cards.  There are other roles that let you block things that are done to you.  

So one person will claim that he can steal two gold from you.  It goes around the table giving everyone a chance to claim to be the guy who can stop that from happening, or giving them a chance to challenge that you are the guy who can steal gold in the first place.  And if someone says they're the guy who can stop you, everyone else has a chance to challenge that too.  

If you're challenged, you reveal a card.  If it is the correct role, you win and the other guy has to discard one of his cards.  If not, you do.  When you lose a challenge the discarded card goes to the table (where everyone can see it and count how many of the three cards of each type are visible) and you don't get a replacement.  When you win a challenge you discard the card you revealed (which gets shuffled into the leftover card deck) and you draw a replacement.  

When you are out of cards, you're out of the game... last man standing wins.There's a lot of bluffing and trying to figure out who really has what. It's a fairly neat, short game.

RATING: 5
Not an enjoyable first play - I had high hopes for [thing=131357][/thing], but the player elimination took out (at least for this play) the bluff, since no one really wanted to be out, so they (and I) used the character we had. So, when a challenge came, it was dead in the water, since the person always had what they said they had.

I thought [thing=131357][/thing] could be a more focused option of game than [thing=139030][/thing], a game I liked, but when I played with more players and not really gamers, the game went nowhere, since very few were paying attention to what was going on. But no - all [thing=131357][/thing] came to be was a way less fun [thing=139030][/thing], and with player elimination, which though it wasn't really a big issue (as the game is fast), it was the reason why everyone was mostly playing safe. The end game was bad: two players were face to ace, one had an Assassin and the other the Contessa, none would let go of them, and the game turned into a simple and deterministic grab-money-to-kill, sine both knew the other do not had the Embassador to stop them from taking 2 money, and the player with the Contessa could do nothing to slow the pace of the other in taking money. So he was killed and it was over. The game at the start and by the middle, was OK, but the end was and anti-climactic. :shake: A bad experience.

The luck for [thing=131357][/thing] is that my group has many copies of it (we bought together 6 copies) and, since it is easy to teach and to play, and a game is fast (around 20 minutes), it will surely have more opportunities to make a good impression - so far, it didn't.

Lastly, it needs to be said that the production value of the brazilian edition of the game is superb: the box is sturdy, the cards are of a good stock, the colors are crisp. Really top notch.

***

After 4 more plays, three with 4 players, and 1 with 5 players, the ending in all of them were still pretty deterministic and without any shred of fun. From the start up until the last rounds - good fun, but the end is killing the game for everyone in my group.

Coup is about convincing your opponents you're holding a card you actually aren't and calling them out when you think they're doing the same to you. Of course, each other player has a little bit of information hinting at your truthfulness, and as the game goes on, each player learns more. By the time all but two are eliminated, perceptive players can deduce which roles are in play, and the game might as well just end at that point. Fortunately, each game is very short, and chaining games back-to-back introduces bluffing on the meta-game level.

There is a lot of game in a small package here.  It is a lot of fun to bluff, do some special power, and not get caught.

Coup is one of these short bluffing/guessing games that I've been really enjoying lately. Sure, people get lucky guessing all the time. Since the game is short, though, you can tolerate the luck  until you get to the really hilarious moments. Maybe someone makes just the right move, or maybe someone makes a hilarious error. It's these moments that the game sets up wonderfully. Get the expansion though.

It's a bit like love letter but with lying allowed. It's still a very quick game but there a lot more bluffing involved. I think it's a bit slower and requires more players than love letter to work but is still something I'm always keen to play more of.

I still need to try this at the right moment. Namely, later at night and with beer close by. I like the spirit of it and it's to be pulled out to empty everyone of their exuberant bullshit. Needs to be played with a certain suspension of disbelief and a bit of drama and antics.

Definitely a 'what you would make of it' game.

To me this feels a little bit like liars dice. To be successful you need to lie. The game length is very short. The box says 15 minutes. We found with 5 players we were finishing games in 10 minutes or less. The decisions and game play during that short amount of time was excellent. Short games also lead to playing more. This is an excellent value for how much this game costs.

RATING: 7.2
This is a good little game for the right people.  It is a type of 'how good are you at deceiving people' type game as you try to knock out the other players.  As you do this, you are playing two characters that are hidden from everyone else and sometimes you need to lie about who you have to win.  It is a great, fast, little game.  Not as good as the resistance, but somewhat solid.

Not impressed. Losing a character early puts you at a huge disadvantage. Admittedly, it's a short game, so that doesn't last long, but there's just not enough interesting to do, and the bluffing aspect is not great. 

I'd much rather play Love Letter, which (in the American version) has the advantage of multiple shorter rounds - you can easily get hosed in a given round of Love Letter, but you have multiple chances.

Good:
-Bluffing & double bluffing
-Calling bluffs
-Easy to count the deck
-A meta-game quickly develops in a group
-Not as skill based as people pretend

Bad:
-Not as skill based as people pretend
-Some people feel uncomfortable lying
-Cards are not balanced
-Everyone says they're the Baron
-Chart makes game appear more confusing
-Often an anti-climatic ending

Overall:
A whole lot is packed into this 15 minute game.  It can give you some of your proudest moments in gaming or it can feel like you died before you could really do anything.  You're brain will be turning the entire time but it never feels stressed or overworked.  The highs make this game worth it as you will be eager to call someone's bluff and try not to give a hint that you were lying through your teeth.  This is on the short list of best fillers on the market.

Played only once, so hard to make a long term judgement on replayability and longevity of this game. I find this game somewhat similar to Love Letter, but certainly more complexity and more bluffing involved. Players try to call each other's bluff over character selection. As more characters are revealed over time and players are eliminated, the ability to bluff gets tougher until only one player is left standing. If playing with a new group of people you hardly know, it is extremely tough to figure out if someone is bluffing. With more plays, you may start to see patterns emerge for specific types of players. This will make educated guesses more likely to hit the mark. However, given that this game is short and there aren't a whole lot of decisions to be made, it hard to play multiple rounds over long periods of time. As it stands, I rate this game higher than I think I will over the long run.

05/2014: Indeed, with a few more plays, Coup has slowly grown stale. While the bluffing and poker faces is occasionally intriguing, the game play has not changed that much. Resistance remains a much better social/deduction game.

Update from 5 to 9 (2/10/16):  Not sure if I was taught the wrong rules, but the additional Foreign Aid action seems to give this game a bit more. The fact that the Duke now has to interject all the time means people might get frustrated enough to at least call them out and force them to change roles at the cost of 1 influence. The Brazilian art version is beautiful!

Old comment: 
This game seemingly revolves around the gain 3 coins ability.

When the player's realise that, it's not exactly all that fun. Calling out a player who's lying at the beginning is fraught with danger and games where everyone is gaining 3 coins is stupid.

RATING: 7
This is my group's favorite filler game. It's simple and light, and the bluffing element is nice, however, with the game group and number of players, the end game typically ends up being a case of forced mathematics and/or random gambits by calling people out on their bluffs. Nevertheless, receives the lion's share of filler time with my group.

I love bluffing and lying games. This one is a real gem. You get two hidden cards (only you know them) and you can claim that one of them is the person which' action you want to use and the other players can decide to call your bluff at the cost of losing one character if they're wrong... that said the gameplay is very short what's perfect for this game.

Cons: I'm not a big fan of Player elimination, take-that (in a non-2-player game), or King-making.
It's just not fun for me, simple as that.

Perhaps part of the reason for me low review is that my expectation was high after all of the hype this game gets. On reddit people are constantly recommending it. I find it to be boring and mean. For bluffing I'd much rather play a game like For Sale, for social deduction (which people seem to think this game is), Resistance Avalon is vastly superior.

There is the potential for a great game in here but it falls short.  Choosing a player to kill can be 100% arbitrary at times and this drops the game down at least a couple of points for me.  It sucks when it happens to you and it's just as unfun having to make the choice yourself.

The expansions added just the right amount of complication to the game.

RATING: 7
The beauty int his game really is in how quickly is plays. Takes 5 minutes to explain, 10 minutes to play, and then you're cruising through multiple games.  

I never thought I'd like a bluffing game, but this one goes so fast it just doesn't feel like that big of a deal.  The Resistance can be exhausting having to argue your point so much, in Coup you're really just staring someone down briefly, "What you don't think I'm that person? Go ahead and call me on it."

The down side is that the game can definitely run it's course and it can happen sooner than you'd expect because of how quick the game plays.  You'll quickly reach a point where you just run into a formula of how you're going to play each turn.  This s where the Reformation expansion helps out in adding another thin layer of strategy.  There can be some great moments where you're trying to think ahead 5 moves and trick people into setting themselves up to lose.

Leaving the rating at ten after a first play with the guys it was a big hit!

I've only played once, and with eight players, which was probably too many players, but I was very underwhelmed.  There was not nearly enough control or deduction possible to make the game interesting.  It became a random crapshoot until the end, at which point the players who had been picked on the least were left to duel it out, and the one who had more resources won easily.  This information may be more interesting and trackable with fewer players, but it felt like all the bad parts of [gameid=925], without the brutal simplicity that makes that game work.

Nice little distraction while in-between games or when you need something for a big group that's easy and fun. Bought the expansion (haven't played) so that may change the rating later, but after 12 plays (1/15/14) I give the game a 8.4.

It's cheap, easy to play/learn, but can provide some very fun moments with a nice group of friends.

I played this a bunch of times, because it is/was a popular filler game in my group. It plays very fast, which is the biggest strength of the game. If you like bluffing it's fine. And I have had my share of fun with the game, but I wouldn't mind if I never played this again.

A bit more "there" there than Love Letter, but really I think there's more interesting fillers out there that are equally accessible, e.g. For Sale, High Society, Riff Raff. I'll play Coup if asked, but see no need for it in my collection.

Great deduction game.  Can be mean so this game may not be for everyone. Also player elimination will be a turn off for some. Light and plays quick. Easy to learn and teach. I wouldn't play with less than 4. Solid fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Coup is a bluffing game and almost nothing else, so if you're not into bluffing, don't waste your time with the game.  If you are into bluffing, though, there's an interesting design here.  You can claim any of eight different actions, five of which are associated with character cards, of which you only ever have two.  Bluffing only ever seems to be a valid tactic early in the game, and then the game has the potential to devolve into situations where you have to be honest, and by then, you might be in a position where it's impossible to beat another player.  Anyone in a good position can just hold on to it and wait it out, and he'll win by attrition.  I also wonder if six is the ideal number of players for the game, since the reserve cards are more limited, which makes it more difficult to bluff as players are eliminated and their cards remain face-up before them.  It's a little annoying, but not terribly so.  It's a lot of fun just watching the game play out after you've been eliminated.

2 plays: 4 players
5 plays: 5 players
13 plays: 6 players

RATING: 7
It's the same game as the La Mame game, but the look and feel of it really makes a difference.  I dislike the artwork and setting in this version, and playing with more than six players seems to make the game less interesting.  Oh, and don't get me started on the Inquisitor role.  If I'm rating the entire game based on that one card, make it a 5.

Played several times in groups ranging from 3-6 people. Not sure if it was the game or the groups, but it wasn't a great experience at any time. Everyone played very conservatively and only made accusations when necessary. It became a waiting game where people just tried to quickly accumulate money. Willing to try it some more but generally pales in comparison to the Resistance.

A microgame that is all about bluffing. In comparison with "Love Letter" (a similar game in that it is composed of only a few cards), this is less accessible but also playable with 5 or 6 players (one of the common complaints with "Love Letter").

RATING: 8
How much you will enjoy a game is entirely subjective.  But, I can say this objectively about the game; I payed $11 dollars for it (it is currently out of stock, but is having a re-print around July-September, 2014, when the expansion is released), and the game has been very easy to teach and get to the table.  It is a short game, so you can play many rounds, and it is not hard to convince people to play a game, as opposed to say Eclipse which is a large time commitment.  

I personally am terrible at lying, bluffing, or telling when others are bluffing, so I enjoy the ability to get better at it!

I love the overall artwork on the cards and the way the Kickstarter version came with alternate art for all the characters.  It's fun, too, although I continue to be terrible at games requiring even the tiniest bit of deception.  There was a similar feel to The Resistance with the bluffing aspect, but I think Coup will be more accessible because of the shorter play time and easier rule set. I'm expecting it will be best on the high end for player count; it was pretty easy to knock someone out in our 3P game.  

UPDATE:  Played this 5P, and it had a very similar feel to our 3P game.  Pretty easy to knock people out and losing both of your cards with the assassin/contessa bluff/counterchallenge seems fairly harsh.

Very entertaining game of bluffing and backstabbing.  Games feel like a knife fight in a phone booth, and are often as short.  My criticisms: end game can often feature influence and/or seating order match-ups wherein one side, ore more, has no realistic chance at winning.  As a result, the end can feel scripted or anti-climatic.  But, at 10 to 20 minutes a game, it hardly matters.

Bluffing.
More bluffing.
Some foregone conclusions but...
Quick wrap-ups often leading to...
Beginning again with bluffing.

Coup is a funny beast. The final result is to differing degrees less interesting than the turn by turn bluffing, as well as the meta-game. Often the conclusion maths-out and isn't interesting, but it resolves so quickly that folks often want to start another game.

That's when Coup truly enters its own, not after a single play, but just playing it again and again with the same group of people. A huge meta-game emerges and folks begin gaming one-another in a big way, and at that point, hilarity often ensues.

In Coup, player gets two secret character cards each. Characters have special abilities, that can be used each turn. The goal is to eliminate all other players cards, by assasignation or coup. The twist is that you can predent to have any character, and perform that special ability. Other players can challenge your honesty, if you lied about your card you loose a card, if you spoke the truth they loose a card.

Bluffing game; you are dealt cards that tell you what actions you can perform... but they're secret.  You have a list of all actions in the game and you can use any of them... but if you use an action that you don't have a card for and someone calls you out, then you lose one of your cards.  If you call someone out and the do have the card, you lose a card.  Lose both cards and your out of the game! Logical deduction alone won't get you through this game, you will need to have a good sense for when your friends are lying.

Very good and very quick-playing game of bluffing and double-guessing.   The rules are fairly simple and the roles are all pretty much straightforward, although it can take a couple plays to get a good feel for all of their interactions and when you should or shouldn't "reveal" their abilities.

It's a really great option when you want to play this sort of game, but don't have time for BSG, you want a bit more structure than Werewolf, and you don't want the tedium of The Resistance.

Probably the best bluffing card game I know! You can basically lie every single turn and confuse the hell out of your opponents. An incredible mind game!

I think Coup was probably designed as a filler, but usually people want to play it for hours!

A quick card game where you can claim that one of your two cards allows you to take an action - like take somebody's money, or kill another player's card. 
But whenever you claim to have a card, other players can challenge your claim. Or claim to have the card that defends them. 
Nice game, and plays up to six. But in my games, bluffing didn't seem to happen very often.

A fun, quick game. Player elimination is not too much of an issue as each round takes only about 15 minutes or so. Incredibly accessible and easy for games and non-gamers to get in to. And can easily be carried around and played almost everywhere that doesn't require silence by the players. Game does feel a bit like a Russian Roulette sometimes, when some people have been eliminated from the round and people are nearing the money threshold to do a Coup.

Played with 5 players and everyone was extremely positive about this game. Screw poker, his is most definitely the bluffing game to go. It's short, simple, tense and has moments of laughter when people reveal their cards and silent moments of satisfaction when no one calls you on your lies. Good game, although it does become a 'money race' when only 2 or 3 players are left, making the end not as exciting as the midgame.

A short 2-6 player bluffing game. Players have two role cards, but can claim to be any role they like. Calling a person our risks one of your cards, but being correct nullifies their action and costs them a card.

Artwork is not very appealing, thought the component quality is fine. 

Player elimination can be a little annoying, particularly if the player is the first to be eliminated. The bluffing element is direct and not subtle, which reduces the game's enjoyment. It is also quite tough for a player to hang on with only one character, which forces players to all play more prudently, thereby further reducing the fun factor.

I am a huge fan of bluffing game, and minimalistic games, so this is right up my alley. I need to play it some more before settling on a rating.

Coup offers an interesting twist on basic bluffing games. My one complaint is that veteran players--those who know the roles and their abilities--tend to demolish inexperienced players. It's the type of game I'd like to play as a filler, but people actually need experience before becoming skilled at Coup. Regardless, it's always a hit with gamers and with non-gamers.

Very light filler/bluffing game. I'm not super high on this, as the strategy seems to be lacking...somewhat. I mean, if someone coups you...well...then you lose. So I have seen several games where it is almost like most popular will win this time around. Interesting game..and it still works for a filler, but I'm not sold on it at the moment.

It's easy to fit this quick bluffing game into a game night!

Each player has hidden influence on two benefactors. On each of their turns, they must take an action from a set of common actions or a set of actions related to each benefactor, invoking their power. You do not need to have influence on the benefactor to take that benefactor's action, but beware, as another character can call you out on a use of a benefactor. If you cannot reveal a truthful influence on the benefactor, you lose one of your two hidden influences!

I probably ought to work on this blurb. Or just note my own thoughts rather than trying to overview the game.

The game is definitely an awesome Take That mechanic. Though problem arises when there are less players playing the game(look up 3 players). That said there isn't much to say about the game after you've played it a lot of times. The replay value wears off overtime.

Me and my friends played so many games of Coup that there's no way to count them all. We would play 6 to 10 hands of Coup whenever we met up for game night and it was the perfect way to get the night started or end on a good note. The bluffing is superb and leads to great laughs when the game is over, which usually only takes about 10 or 15 minutes at the most. After playing a LOT of games, the luster starts to wear a little as some endgames play out the exact same way, due to the math of collecting coins to coup and who has what cards left. However, you'll get so many good games out of this little package, and for the price, it's well worth it.

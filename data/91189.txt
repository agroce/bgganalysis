This is a favorite of mine.  There is nothing groundbreaking about the game, it is just fun.  The mechanics work really well, the game is fun, and it feels very thematic.

It's shame that it is so hard to track down right now because this one is a lot of fun to play.  If you get the chance don't hesitate to pick this one up.

A könnyed grafika egész komoly játékot takar, pedig csak a családi változatot próbáltuk. Szerintem ez csak gémer családokkal játszható! A játék nagy szabadságot ad, ez adja a nehézségét, maga a szabály elég egyszerű. A játék végül is csak annyi, hogy a menünkre kerülnek fel folyamatosan ételek, amikhez nyersanyagokat kell beszerezni a piacról. Bizonyos időközönként pénz, majd a végén pont is jár a menünkön lévő ételek után. A kihívást az adja, hogy egymással is versenyzünk (ki mennyi új ételt tett a menüjére adott körben, illetve a végén kié a legjobb menü több szempont szerint is), és egymástól függetlenül is díjaz minket a játék a minél stílusosabb menüért (az összetartozó ételkártyákon különféle jeleknek stimmelni kell), és a megfelelő borválasztásért. A körök végén egy ember (a licit győztese) pontra válthatja a pénzét, ha valamitől, hát ettől családi a játék, mert ez kicsit komolytalan egy egyébként soktényezős játékban. És bár a végén is pontot érhet a pénz (annak, akinek a legtöbb van), ennek ellenére kicsit súlytalanak érzem a szerepét, talán csak akkor lehet pénzszűke a játékban, ha valaki az első körben semmit se tesz a menüjére. A csillagok megszerzésekor kicsit túlbonyolították a lapkákat, simán elég lett volna, ha csak csillag lapkák vannak (hacsak a haladó változatban nincs szerepe a többi lapkának).
Bár a kártyahúzásoknál mindig 5-ből választunk, és a piacon is könnyen változtatható a kínálat, mégis elég komoly szerencsefaktor van a játékban. Aki az első kört elrontja, nem nagyon tudja szerintem visszahozni a játékot, mert folyamatosan kevesebb pénzt kap, kevésbé jó kajákat tehet az étlapjára stb. Ami még érdekes, hogy a 3 sapkás ételeket nagy eséllyel senki sem tudja kifejleszteni a játékban.

Összességében nem lenne ez rossz családinak, ha kicsit egyszerűbb lenne. A komoly változatát nem próbáltuk, nincs kizárva, hogy ami a családiban nem tetszett, abban korrigálva van, és akkor akár komolyabb játéknak is megteszi.

1 játék alapján azt mondom, hogy a legegyszerűbb kajákra kell gyúrni, kerülni kell a kockázatos, 3-4 nyersanyagra épülő ételeket.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I had fun playing the game, and would play again for sure, however the down time caused by the card drawing mechanism in this game is killer.  It is very tough to plan your turn out in this one, and if someone does AP, it can really slow this one down to a crawl.  I did feel like the theme came through really well.  I also wasn't a huge fan of the bidding mechanism where you lose half your money if you don't win the auction.  Money also seemed WAY to easier to get, even with the variant we played where you could not buy a wine card until season 2 (of 4).

I wanted to like this game, but I think it has some problems.  For one, there is an over abundance of money.  It is very easy to get an income of $70 yo $80 per turn.  When the ingredients you have to buy for a recipe cost $1 to $3 or $4 each, there is no tension involving money.  It seemed like an overly simple game, partly because of that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I really wanted to like this one. The theme is great. But after the first round you have far too much money. There is no angst in what you can buy, only if it will be available in the market. The auction for VIP seems a little tacked on, and since money is so abundant, there's no reason not to throw a ton of money at it. I think a good developer could make a nice game out of this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Strategies abound! So much so that it feels as though a player can do nothing wrong. Until the end of the game arrive, somebody else wins by 30 points, you realize some of your choices weren't optimal, and you don't know where you went wrong. I may be bothered more by this if the gameplay weren't so delightfully pleasant.

It really helps when players get into the spirit of the theme, presenting their menus in snobby accents with appropriate moustache-twirling bravado.

A lot more tight and deeper than the theme and simple rules make it out to be. Fans of Dungeon Petz, Vinhos, Pret-A-Porter, Drum Roll which are games that has you setting up to present something at the end of a round. The theme is high in this, everything makes sense and is very fun.

Picked up on a whim, and what a good choice that was - very fun title, with lots of bits and a good range of management, all of which must be balanced in order to earn high scores. I do think the stock replacement mechanics could be tweaked to allow for a little more strategic discarding, and lower the highly likely nature of what is required hitting the shelves (an increase in tension and risk is always a good choice), and so that option used to only remove one row of three items seems to provide a nice balance. A lot of game is contained in this title, and the quality, style, and components are all top notch.

I rather like the Italian cuisine, and know how to make quite a number of good recipes. So I was rather hopeful to be able to find a similar level of appreciation in this game. Regrettably, this did not turn out to be the case, at least for the basic version.

While reading the rules, as well as playing, I felt a little bit like playing Shipyard but then without all the rondels. The idea is to puzzle together a good menu rather than be a competitive bastard about it. That is okay and fine and even fun (despite all the cooking reality shows, cooking to me is still a challenge to myself, and not to others), but the basic game features too few actions to attempt anything interesting and/or audacious. It also enhances the luck of the draw to an uncomfortable and perhaps even game-breaking degree. In Shipyard, you have [i]many[/i] actions to prepare yourself for the various point-delivering occurrences. Despite leafing through the Ristorante Italia’s rulebook on numerous occasions I could not find anything wrong with the fact that at the end of the game, I had three times as much money as my partner just because the overlap between her recipes and the open ingredients sucked (to put it mildly). Such a situation is simply not fun. My current rating is based on this game, and I’m being generous here.

The question then is: would the more advanced rules remedy this imbalance? Perhaps. Personally I feel the most important change is in the bonus cards which can really help you in tight spots... But the fact that these come out at random too doesn’t sit very well with me either. In fact I'd much rather play with the super-advanced rules which prohibit the purchase of wine in the first season, and introduce of an ‘apprentice’ action which allows direct purchase of an ingredient at the cost of both allotted turn actions. Perhaps then the game would begin to resemble something interesting. But I would need extra play sessions to find out, and without a copy at hand that is going to be difficult.

All in all, I’m disappointed in that Ristorante Italia turned out to be something I wasn’t at all expecting. Had it been a puzzle of Shipyard-proportions, I’d have purchased a copy gladly, and drooled over the various genuine recipes I would have had access to... But right now it feels too much like the discount cookbooks you find in bookstores. You know, the ones with recipes you don't find particularly appetitising, despite the pretty pictures.

[b]Update[/b] I was in the opportunity of playing another game, this time with the 'normal' advanced rules, so without the wine restriction and the apprentice. The game is definitely better then: despite the bonus cards coming out at random the game offers more control over what you want to do; and it is not really possible anymore to get stuck in a position without sufficient cash unless you work at it. I think the game will improve yet again somewhat if you include the final two rules, though. So in that the design team is vindicated. The game is in setting a challenge to yourself, not the other players, and if you like that sort of thing then perhaps Ristorante Italia is worth a go.

Howeverrrrr... I found I didn't really like the obscurity of the scoring. During the game it is hard to see how well you (or someone else for that matter) is doing, so the counting at the end comes as a bit of a surprise to all involved. There's also a Die Macher-like problem: points arriving from different things which seem not to be related all that much, making estimation of trade-offs difficult. The result is that although I increased the rate, I cannot increase it more than I would like to have seen.

This is dripping with theme while having a reasonable amount of strategy.  It's not the heaviest strategy game, but it's a lot of fun.  I enjoy cooking and baking, so this theme is fun for me.  Unlike Fish Cook, I feel like this game knows what it is and who it is for.  I feel like it does scale well for the amount of players and offers 2 difficulty settings.  I enjoy bringing it to the table.

Initial impression after 1 game of the base version (5-players). The game is very pretty and colorful (maybe too much, for someone) and plays smoothly. Interaction is quite limited but when it occurs in the form of the auction to bribe the VIPs it is pretty fun. Tension mounts in the last rounds, when you have to prepare your menus and your restaurant for the final contests.

This is a good game that is hard to get on the table.  I've concluded that people have prejudice for games contained within boxes that have fun cartoon style art.  I'm thinking of printing a cooking scene from the Middle ages where everyone looks angry, as this type of art, for some reason gives a game credibility.  Anyway, in this game you assemble meals for points and get bonuses if you can acquire wines that match the meals.  A set collecting game without very much player interaction is a very brief explanation.  You need to always have a Plan B as another player may take what you want.

Based off of the basic game. The mechanics are simple, and there's not a whole lot of options. It took us a game to figure it out, but it's basically a set collection game where the scoring combinations are where the strategy comes in. After the first game we had a lot better understanding of things and started to see it's potential.

Entertaining game with a fun theme that works well. With four players, it was decidedly too long for my taste (even in the basic version), but we had a thoroughly good time (although I was rather certain I wouldn't win after a certain time). How does anyone ever reach three hats with four players? Never, right?
Oh, and get a big table for this. 
Update: With two players and all rules, it's an appropriate 90 minutes and definitely better.
One big drawback is the tiebreaker system - it's way too powerful. Points should be shared instead of an all or nothing, I'd say.

Könnyed családi játék. Egyelőre csak az alapjátékot játszottuk. Nem meglepő módon egy étteremben kell ételeket összeállítani a rendelkezésre álló nyersanyagokból. A teljes menü előételből, első-, második fogásból és desszertből áll. Illetve ezekhez választunk bort. 4 forduló van, minden fordulóban 3 akciókör és 3 pontozó kör. Az akció körben 2 akciónk lehet tetszőlegesen. Alapvetően kártyát húzunk valamelyik pakliból vagy/és hozzávalókat veszünk a 6 piacról. A pontozás során a frissen készített ételeink után kapunk pontokat, amellyel nő majd a szakácsunk tapasztalata. Így majd összetettebb ételeket is elkészíthetünk. Ezt követően licitálunk hogy egy VIP vendégünk legyen az éttermünkben, majd az elkészült ételek és borok alapján bevételt kapunk. A játék végén a teljes menüt is értékeljük.

A játék nagyon hangulatos, igazi családi játék. Ennek megfelelően nagy benne a szerencse szerepe (milyen ételeket kapunk, ahhoz vannak-e hozzávalók a piacon). Szép kivitelezésű játék, családi körben még ki fogom próbálni.

To everybody who reads here, and has already played something else than bingo and tic-tac-toe, I strongly suggest to disregard the infos on the box, the advanced game is anyway a medium light game to be blayed in 60-90 minutes from a gamer's point of view.
As such it flows sweetly and almost flowlessly for some good fun.
Only issue I have are the chef hats that are lovely from for theme but terrible for keeping scores (or at least the cook-o-meter should had been at least twice as big.
Anyway really a good job guys!!!

One of those games that I know isn't great, but I like it anyway.

The basic idea is fun, the available actions are few and straightforward every time it's your turn. The theme is well implemented and there is a decent luck element that keeps it relatively balanced and family friendly.

The main problems for me are: 
- There isn't enough of a money-management aspect to it - the ingredients you buy for the recipes are too cheap and there is almost no way you can be short on cash at any point.
- The "advanced" game just adds a handful of extra actions that are very shoe-horned in and don't add to the game much at all, other than to punish players who miss a particularly powerful bonus card.

Still, a fun game that will probably stay in my collection.

A prototypical light-medium euro - but the design feels pretty tight, and the theme is integrated really well.  

Play with the advanced rules if you're not playing with young kids.  They aren't cumbersome or hard to manage at all, and they add all the zest to the game.  I'd give the base game a 5.5.  I give the "advanced" game (which is about as complicated as Attika or Thurn and Taxis) an 8.

I'm a lover of fine Italian food, and I go to Italian restaurants only less frequent compared with Chinese restaurants. However, I could only give this game a 6 as I would like to tell the truth to my fellow gamers who're not Italian food lovers.
Mechanism-wise, this game plays like a multi-player solitaire and the only real interaction that I could think of is during the auctions for VIPs. During other times you may want to interrupt other players, but as you can't see the 'future menus' of the other players you can hardly do that intentionally. Same is also true for the bonus cards.
Personally, I appreciate this game very much as there is none other game which sticks to the theme so well. 1 of my gamemates mentioned that this game works as an 'educational game' to all those who's never enjoyed Italian food. Can't agree more.
In summary, if you just want to play a game, stay away. You can find many other games better than this one. However, if you want something that's not that gamey but at the same time, educational about Italian food, do get this game.

RATING: 5
This game is just too fluffy, even with the "advanced" variant.  There is a distinct lack of confrontation, though perhaps that is intentional.  You can't determine what recipes your opponents are building towards since those cards are face down until played.  Hence, you can't strategically clear ingredients or take specific cards to thwart their plans.  That being said, the game is not completely devoid of strategy.  Bidding on VIPs is a big part of the game as is properly selecting recipes in order to maximize endgame rewards.

Edit - After three plays, I am starting to think the game has a runaway leader problem.  If you are fortunate enough to draw three recipes in the first year that only need one ingredient each, you will be set on income for the rest of the game making it easier to win stars.  Additionally you will have an easy time making it to the top of the chef track, which will allow you to win the golden spoons at the end of the game.  I really believe that recipes should always be face up as this would allow for strategically blocking.

For once, I wish a game were just a bit heavier to better mesh with its theme. Worth a try, at least.

Update: The theme doesn't come through quite enough for me anymore to offset the pedestrian game play. Draw a card, buy or "fish" for ingredients unit it's ready. Try another recipe, and repeat with scoring rounds every three turns. Some advanced actions including bonus cards do a little to break up the basic resource gathering, but not much. Still enjoy the artwork and theme, though. Long setup and heavy rules overhead for a simple game makes me hesitate to pull it out.

This is a really cute game about running an Italian restaurant, but sadly the only mechanism here is luck on card and token flips, without much else to do or think about. One of the strange things about this game is it seems like they put a lot of rules in to help the randomness, like being able to discard the array of faceup tokens and replenish before you buy, and drawing 5 cards and picking one, but despite this, luck of the flip is still the progression barrier you run into while playing. I could see this being a good gateway game for younger kids maybe, but it's not a keeper for me.

A játék tipikus hibába esett. Nagy szerencsefaktor, ugyanakkor nem könnyű játék. 2 órás és szinte mindent a szerencse határoz meg azonos képességű játékosok között. Éttermet menedzselünk, ahol előételt, első és második fogást, illetve desszerteket csinálunk, maximum fajtánként kettőt. Ehhez alapanyagokat szerzünk, illetve bort választunk. Célunk a 4 fordulón keresztül mindig minél erősebb újításokat bevezetni az étlapunkra, pénzzel VIP vendégeket meggyőzni, hogy nálunk egyenek, illetve a játék végén minél jobban stimmelő menüsort összeállítani. Aranyos játék, ami inkább családi, de annál azért nehezebb döntések is vannak benne, hogy egy gyerek is teljes mértékben élvezze a játékot. Gémernek pedig a mindenhol jelentkező szerencsefaktora miatt egyáltalán nem nevezhető. Vannak benne érdekes dolgok is. A VIP vendég megszerzésénél nem látom át miért ne lenne mindig egyértelmű, hogy az összes pénzünket feltegyük, hisz utána a bevétel fázisban jóval több pénzt kapunk, mint ami az alapanyagok megvásárlásra szükséges. Ha valaki peches, semmi esélye nincs a játékban, így nehéz jó pontot adnom a játéknak.

Very thematic and really nice artworks.
The economics of the game needs to be revised.  When you have 80$, 1-5$ ingredient aren't much of problem.  The VIP bribe at the end of the round seems phoned in to ride you of money.

Fun restaurant game that can get competitive, or play with the kids in the main version of the game and have fun preparing meals.

Sleeved.
Much better with 3 or more. With 2, it can be a bit tedious trying to get the ingredients you need.

Nice design and theming, fun to play. The level of randomness in the recipe decks and in the market bins, and the well worn mechanisms keeps the rating from being higher for me.

Rated 6 with full advanced version. 


Basic game would make a great gateway game.

I have even played a simplified version (adapted by my self ;)) with my 4 years old boy, He was sticked all the game :D trying to find ingredients to prepare his restaurant menu. It helped hime even to learn basic principles as money, make simple mathematical aditions with money, cost of things. Etc.

 It's a good game. The theme is really well thought out. Money is too abundant, which is a downfall. Lot's of pieces and things to keep track of. Best with 3 players, but plays well with 2. 4 is a bit messier and can be quite long, but still enjoyable. Needs a lot of table space to play, especially with more than 2 players or when playing the advanced version.

Simpatico il tema il gioco un po' meno. Troppo semplice per gli adulti troppo elaborato per i giovani.

Solid game - not sure why you need so much money , nothing stunning in here, but it fits the theme - a bit difficult to work out who is likely to be winning until you get to the end - but some will see that as a positive.

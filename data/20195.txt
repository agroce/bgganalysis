A good take on Tic-Tac-Toe concept. This is basically the same game we used to play through primary school and junior high, exceot for that we used pen and paper, square grid and we aiming at five in a row. So, Six felt quite nostalgic even on the first play.

I like how the hexagonal lattice allows for other shapes besides a traditional row. However, the game is an abstract and I cannot honestly call it particularly exciting. It's decent but that is all.

A good fast abstract game that is super easy to learn.  You have to think in several different directions at once, which differentiates it from your typical X-in-a-row game.  Very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Purely an abstract and good one at that.  Game play centers on creating 1 of 3 distinct arrangements of 6 player pieces.  The shapes are not difficult to make in general except your opponent's pieces keep getting in the way.  inexperienced players will often win or lose before all pieces are on the 'board'.  Experienced players actually see an entirely different second half of the game.  In the second half, players must remove one of their pieces and place it in a new location.  This can cause pieces to become separated from the board and these are lost.  Thus while play in the second half has the same goal, the means to get get there changes.  A truly solid abstract game.

Simple little 2 player abstract purchased on the cheap from Barnes and Noble. Lay down your hexagonal pieces until you form one of 3 shapes; a ring of 6 pieces, a line of 6 pieces, or a 6 piece pyramid. Now you know why it is called Six.

An interesting little abstract - rather reminiscent of Connect 4 but with hexagons (Connect 6?). Only played once, I took the first turn and it all seemed rather one-sided. Was it just because I rock, because there is an inherent first player advantage or just one of those things? Only time and further plays will tell.

At first, it looks to be a simple exercise in tedious hexagon placement again and again until a simple shape is created. A ho-hum affair with little to provide in the way of entertainment or challenge. A hexagon here, a hexagon there, and you are suddenly very aware that you are close to loosing! How did this happen? Without even a hint of change, the game turns into a battle of wits as you attempt to out maneuver and out play your opponent in an ever shifting game where you are ahead one moment and then greatly behind the next!

My initial reaction is that it kinda looks like "[gameid=2655] for Dummies" . . . however, it actually does take some good brain activity to play.

My other initial take is that once you have two good players, very few (if any) games will be won in the initial placement of the stones.  Many games would seem to come down to the "moving of the stones" phase, where "trapping" your opponent's stones will be key.  [Note: Based on my results, I don't qualify as a "good player" yet.]

Initial Rating: 6.0 (March 2011)

Six is an ok abstract game. 

The rules are very easy to learn, but gameplay is, somewhat, interesting. Sometimes you lose without noticing you were going to lose, and I like that.

Playtime is around 15 minutes.

Reading from the entry on BGG, I didn´t know you could play the game as a 4 player game. I don’t know how the rules work that way but for me, Six is a 2 player game.	

Bottom line, Six is an ok game. My desire to play it isn’t very high, but I would play if requested. I prefer a lot of better abstract games.

RATING: 4
Online play at yucata.de - Six is an abstract with the potential to annoy players. While it's not so difficult to hinder the opponent to get six tiles in one of the three winning figure in the first half of building up, the game can easily be decided against inexperienced players at this point in time. From there, it's a dragging war of attrition if played to the end with one player having no alternative to reactive moves until there's no chance to block anymore. Although I could easily play it on yucata to gain experience, I have only very limited desire to do so.

Imagine chess if someone just taught you the rules but none of the strategy.  That's the problem with a lot of people who only ran across six on yucata.  There are multiple types of forks to be had, there is an endgame that most experienced players will always get to similar to chess.  Likewise aggression will likely give you a better position for this endgame such that you can preset up some sweet plays.  Like chess one mistake does often loose you the game but in that same way repeat plays should continue to enhance your skill when played against a better opponent.  Played against novice opponents only you can get a sort of back and forth where neither player really understands how to win again not unlike the chess endgame.  There was a time when I almost never lost.  I haven't played as much in the last few years as I try to play in person now but obviously it's hard to find a challenging enough opponent without going online.

Despite my comparisons to Chess that work to explain the concepts above, the game itself is far different.  Its one of trying to make 1 of 3 possible patterns of six tiles before your opponent does. Once all tiles are played you remove and replay a tile though in doing so you often divide the board such that all pieces in the smaller half are removed from play entirely.

A very elegant, lightweight abstract. Simple rules, plays relatively quickly (about 15-20 mins/game), good depth of strategy. 3 different victory conditions gives high flexibility and requires early recognition of developing patterns.

6 seems an appropriate rating.  Initially I thought it would be too difficult to create a 6-piece pattern.  However, once the game gets going one can see that the three victory condition patterns seem to work well together.  It also seems like both players need to be trying to win during the first phase in order to make the game work -- after all pieces have been played to the board if no player has won then a second phase of taking pieces off the board begins.  I found the game a bit tense solely because I was constantly afraid of missing my opponent's winning move (i.e. not seeing the shapes in front of me).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Feels somewhat like [gameid=748] (and therefore [gameid=38462]), in that success depends on recognition of certain patterns that can be used to create sequences of forced moves. But I like the others better. I'm interested in learning those patterns, for sure, but there's nothing here that stands out. (If you like this, you might want to check the others out.) The second phase turns about to be a war of attrition more than anything else, which is not really my idea of fun.

Also, the first-player advantage here seems excessively strong. Only thing that keeps my rating above that of [gameid=11930] is the use of the one-hive rule.

RATING: 6
It’s a simple abstract hex placement game, trying to get 6 in a row, 6 in a triangle or 6 in a loop. But of course anytime you get near, it's easy to block. It means you need to set up a multiple threat situation (Connect 4 style) which can't be countered. Or play until the 22 tiles are all gone where it moves into tile removal and re-place mode, where you can Zertz-like eliminate isolated groups of hexes. I imagine this can be pretty potent if you've been playing for it. I’ve no idea how much depth and look-ahead there is - probably pretty decent - but I found it difficult to tell from the initial game. It's neat and can be enjoyable with another abstract lover, but it has no real hook and  ... it's a pure abstract, which don't often see the table hereabouts.

This is a nice little abstract. As you get a little better at it, the first part of the game becomes a delicate balance of blocking your opponent while setting yourself up for the second phase.

Played several games of this, the last game seemed like it would have gone on forever so we quit.  I think it would be more fun if victory was quick and hard to defend against, but it may be a long, slow, painful affair.

Quick abstract with more depth than there first appears. Upon closer examination, good play requires planning far ahead in advance, and setting up traps. A hidden gem.

"Hive Lite" describes the game fairly well, but it's also a little misleading, since it doesn't have the same sort of depth as one would expect from even a proclaimed "Hive Lite."  In the advanced game, there's too much of an opportunity to just keep doing and undoing the same kind of move once the game enters into the "play a piece from anywhere on the board" stage, and it's a little annoying.  Sure, the best argument against entering that stage is "Don't get into a position where your opponent can do it," but it seems like an inelegant condition of the game.  The basic game, oddly enough, has more tension and elegance, though it's still not as good or as satisfying a game as Hive, which is what it feels like it wants to be.  Like most abstract games, Six has a nice tension and is satisfying enough for what it is, but it won't unseat other, more satisfying abstract games.  It's like it needs to simmer on the stove a little while longer or something.

5 plays: 2 players (basic)
3 plays: 2 players (advanced)

My wife loves abstract games with a high component quality, so I got this one and it does not disappoint. It is easy to learn but hard to master and the game looks elegant on the table. For me it is lighter than Abalone (which is more a chess-like brain burner) and could be compared to Backgammon - in that we can have a great time playing ten games in a row and talk about different things at the same time. In essence: This is a great coffee table game.

Okay abstract, but nothing more.
I don't see why I would ever play this over Exxit, for instance.

simple and fast but, after just one game, it seems a bit shallow and repetitive, with chains of forced moves. i am sorry, i am not caught by this

Sometime in 2012:
Good game, good mechanics... Easy to understand. On 4 games played yet... won the 4 of them. So not really the type of game I want to keep. :)

Basically a variation on something like gomoku, but with a greater number of patterns you can form to win... the trouble is that, at least for beginners, the game is generally won by someone overlooking the opponent's immediately winning move, rather than by one person out-thinking the other. I think it should have a "check" rule for this reason; i.e. you must announce when you've created a shape one hex away from a win.

Deceptively easy.  Great short game for rain days or evenings while camping.  Usually set up for one game and then get tournaments going since we don't want to stop.

Reminds me of Hive more than anything else.  Just another abstract that really doesn't have anything unique to call its own.  I don't see any convincing reason to play this over games like Quinamid and the GIPF series with similar concept.

Nice abstract, but like so many elemental abstracts, the game is won or lost by one less-than-perfect move, perhaps 10 turns earlier.

This was my first ever board game purchase.  It holds a special place in my heart, and on my shelf (the box is odd shaped, worn, and doesn't really fit).

It's a good game, a solid abstract.

RATING: 7
Fun game, but requires a lot of patience to really feel how your actions effect the game state.  Physically pushing the game pieces is a big part of the charm of this game.

Abalone was pretty cool. It's a very simple abstract that offers a lot of depth. I would like to play this one a few more times before I would track down a copy of it. I also need to learn how to play it faster.

I love the look and feel of the game. I like moving those marbles on the board. Nevertheless, I never managed to "get the game" and to understand how to play it properly. Now, the game is not as "trendy" as it used to be and I don't really feel like working on improving myself upon it.

This is a fun game, akin to sumo wrestling.  It's 2p by default, but you can get other colored balls for it that let you play with 3 or 4 people.  I got this *years* before I got bitten by the board game bug, but it was a good choice and I still enjoy it.  A nice abstract.

RATING: 4
I remember my best friend regularly beating me when we played as kids.  Perhaps that's why I don't like it, but I think it has more to do with preferring more dynamic abstracts.  This is a very slow game that is all about improving your position incrementally (I could be wrong here...as mentioned, I usually lost this game!).

I find this just an okay strategy game.  
The game is very easy to learn and I find the object of the game to be quite unique.

You would want to get the different starting layouts to avoid the drawish behaviour.

I find this does not get any play time these days.

RATING: 2
Fundamentally broken as an abstract game.  This is like Sumo - with the wrong rules, that the wrestlers can freely touch the ground with any parts of their bodies.  Thus, unless the opponent is so overwhelmingly strong enough that he can just lift you up and toss you out of the ring, any person who can sit or lie down becomes unbeatable.  It's an exciting sport if the wrestlers stand and fight, but charging against a sitting opponent will always bring defeat, so why bother.  A "2" instead of "1" (or "0") only for the components.

Good Abstract Area Control game.  You can push 1, 2, or 3 of your pieces at a time, and can push back the opponents pieces if they are less than the number of your pieces that you are pushing to a location.  There is quite a bit of tactics in this game, and a little strategy thrown in as well.

Once you know how to play you can play for a draw every game. There is also a way to break the game. the first person to attack always looses if you know how to play. Concepts is great, game fails to implement it and enough opening move variations.

When this game came out in the late 80s it had a few rules attached.

If you organize a game convention in French-speaking territory, you have to plug it and give it at least a prize "d'or". If your convention was taking place in another language zone, but you liked to be associated with the word "Mensa" than you still had to give it the top price. And if you ran an electrical store and knew sod all about games than you had to stock piles of it.

Oh, and don't try to make an attacking move.. it doesn't work.

The box claims it's "the game of the decade."  I guess the 80's sucked.

The beginning of the game is good, but the endgame is profoundly wearisome.  Since the objective is to roll each other's stones out of play, you have fewer and fewer stones at your disposal as the game nears completion.  There's too much space to run around in, and the losing player can stave off defeat for a rather long time even if he has no chance of winning.

If I'm going to play a two-player game with no luck and no theme, I might as well bust out my chess set or Go board.  There is little compelling reason to play a game so thoroughly mediocre.

A fine abstract, shining for the ever-changing strategies it requires: one turn you feel success is in your grasp, the next one you have to do something about it quickly since your opponent reversed the situation by shifting just one ball.

Excellent components -- I haven't seen the shoving-the-bits mechanic before, and the board is a great implementation of it.  The game itself rates in the middle for me, based on one play.

RATING: N/A
The "travel" version has pieces that are just too small and light and get pushed too easily in directions other than what the player intends.  And the plastic cover that should keep the pieces in place when traveling will pop right off the board without something like a rubber band to keep it on.  I replaced this with the current regular sized edition.

Thrifted.  I enjoyed this game more than I thought I would, but suspect that it doesn't have a lot of staying power.  Beautiful pieces, board works very nicely.  Tendency to have to play defensively really lengthens the game and makes it less interesting than it could have been.  Still fun in the early stages, though, and definitely worth the $3 thrifted price.
Edit:  Alternate starting positions (as pictured in the Abalone gallery) definitely add some variety and interest.  My kids and I have really enjoyed playing some of these.

The game, while having gorgeous components and a pleasant clic-clac mechanism to lock the marbels in place, is not fun to play if you set it up in its standard position: it becomes a matter of keeping your group of marbles together longer than the other player. This extremely defensive style dulls the game to a nearly unplayable degree. I always meant to try and play this game with a variant of sorts, but I never had the heart to do so. At some point, I simply gave it away. and I regret to say it shall not be missed.

Zakupiłam wersję travel ze względu na niższą cenę za taką samą grę tylko w mniejszych rozmiarach i nie spodziewałam się niczego nadzwyczajnego. Jednak jestem pozytywnie zaskoczoną grą i zdecydowanie przerosła moje oczekiwania. Jest ładnie i solidnie wykonana, kulki już kilka razy poleciały na kafelki, ale nie ucierpiały. Sama rozgrywka trzyma w napięciu, a proste zasady sprawiają, że można nauczyć w nią grać każdego. Przywodzi na myśl trochę szachy ze względu na kolory i tematykę logiczną.

Well, I own this but it has been ages since I've played it. The reason isn't that I don't like it but that you really need to find an opponent who plays at "your strength". For me it's the same as with chess: Either you play it against someone who plays this game far better or worse than you. Then it isn't that much fun as you'll most likely crush your opponent or will be crushed by her/him. Or you have to find someone whose playing ability matches yours. Since I couldn't find someone who plays this game as worse as I do and I'm not really willing to put the needed effort into the game to become as good as the other Abalone-players I know (not with all the other great games out there). It probably won't hit the table in the near future again.

+ Nice abstract with a good looking board and components.
+ Rules are clear and easy to grasp.

- Fun depends heavily on matching abilities of the players.

RATING: 3
An abstract that looks pretty, but the game is basically broken, as no experienced player will ever want to attack. One should always sit tight and keep the marbles together, since attacking surely brings defeat. Unless playing against me, I usually lose regardless of the opponent's moves. But I'm not really prepared to put the effort into getting good at a faulty game.

This has become my go-to 2-player abstract to play with my oldest daughter.  I can see where games might linger with evenly matched, observant opponents.  That being said, it hasn't become dull for us yet!  I feel like it is a pretty good game for teaching kids about tactics and strategy.  The components are awesome, too. 

UPDATE: We've been playing with the Belgian Daisy opening set up, which has kept things fresh.

I am not into Abstract Strategy game. It's not my favorite mechanic/theme. I find it to be not to my liking compared to other game mechanics. There are better Abstract Strategy games out there than Abalone. Yinsh is a whole lot more to my liking than Abalone for example.

I wouldn't say no to trying other Abstract Strategy games.

It wasn't really interesting for a 2 player abstract. Wasn't fun either. It's not my kind of game. It didn`t really impress me.

It's very doubt full that I would replay this game any time soon to see my opinion changes.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

I'm not a fan of abstract piece-moving games, so my rating is inherently biased.  My biggest problem with Abalone specifically, is that the game feels like a staredown contest.  It takes far too much effort to put together a successful attack, so both players just spend most of their time maintaining a defensive position.  I like the components and the concept, but the game is boring.

Aburrido: largo y repetitivo para lo que es. Todo se basa en aprovechar un error del rival, que puede tardar mucho en producirse, entre jugadas similares cuando no repetidas, para acabar ganando una partida a costa de un desliz más provocado por la indiferencia del tedio que por no saber jugar. No resulta tan interesante como para que las distintas fases del juego creen tensión, como en el Ajedrez, por ejemplo.

SOLD for free in a larger sale; my copy was a thift copy I got for a few bucks.

JAN 2018 - It's funny to read my older comment on this game: it must have been a very brief flirtation with abstracts, because I haven't liked them before or since! Abalone is a great game for what it is though: gorgeous to look at, simple ruleset, and interested cat-and-mouse gameplay. I just don't care for abstracts, or shorter, simpler games for that matter.

2006? Played 4 times. First Einfach Genial, and now Abalone...I am starting to not hate abstracts. Something about the process fo this game makes me enjoy it so much. Win or lose, I just find the game memerising. Something about the way the masses of the rows build up, and the trapping aspect. Very good game.

I love this game.  Love it.  It is so strategic, much like the Gipf series, and it is SO tactile.  Playing the game is very satisfying.  It's funny, I have the travel version and HATE IT, because the balls don't have the weight of the full sized one.

Minha versão é a [i]travel[/i]. Ultra portátil. Jogo fantástico de movimentação. Cada jogador controla uma série de esferas e movimentas essas esferas no tabuleiro tentando empurrar as esferas adversárias para fora do tabuleiro. Quem empurrar 6 esferas do adversário para fora vence. Fantástico. Parece leve mas altamente estratégico.

RATING: 6
This game seems to reward passivity a lot, and I don't particularly enjoy that in an abstract. Also, when you start to lose stone the game gets harder and harder, so it's constantly downhill. For these reasons I'm not too eager to try and master this game. I'd rather play the simple, quick and beautiful Siam. (Update. Rating went up 1 point. I'm not good at it, but I enjoyed it more than before.)

This was a childhood favourite and a semi-classic in modern abstract gaming.  I'm afraid that two equal players could turtle for awhile before a winner is determined.

Nice game. Fantastic quality of the elements. Nice thing's that most of the attacks'll make you weaker.
The bad thing is that you can easily get stuck in some kind of pat with your opponent ;/

This game is a "9" with a minor rule change.  Instead of clumping the marbles for an initial set-up. Split each players forces into two equal groups.  One player places groups North / South.  The other player places East / West.  As a mathematician I am 80% sure that the game instructions as written are fatally flawed and that good players will always draw.

Had to comment on this one as it is the first in my collection.  Abalone has very tactile and satisfying components.  The game play pushing balls around to knock off opposing balls is adequate to keep my interest for a while.

Hasn't seen play in years due to my wife's hatred for symetric battle games that don't involve luck (Sorry, Hive...)

RATING: 6.5
An interesting game. Fun to click and clack the marbles about. Triangles are powerful formations.

In some ways, this is an older school style of abstract game compared to Blokus or Hive or any given GIPF game. Many of those games play fast but Abalone is more likely to be a slow, thoughtful game.

Until you start making mistakes, at least.

I have the travel edition. The full-sized version would be better but a storage issue.

Great abstract with lots of support and variants.

This game has the feel of the more classic games of Chess and Go. Neither of which I really care for.

Q: Why do you like this game better than Chess?

A: Chess feels very scripted to me, where Abalone, in my opinion, offers more freedom in strategic conception and execution.

Q: Why do you like this game better than Go?

A: Go would require copious amounts of time for me to become "good", and I have no desire to live a Go lifestyle to become a "good" player. Abalone seems to come naturally to me and has a bit more of a casual feel.

RATING: 6
This game was my re-introduction to abstract gaming, and, I'll admit, the component design is of superior quality.  Pushing the marbles can be quite a lot of fun.  However, it can be far too easy to turtle in the game, which hurts it.  I have seen alternate starting positions which alleviate this problem, so it may not be an insurmountable issue.  In any case, this game has largely been replaced by the GIPF series in my affections.

I have enjoyed playing this game many times.  You can even play it in the wind!  I love the way the balls go 'chunk' when you push a long row of them.

It is too easy, however, to slip into a stagnant dance with your opponent (2 player) while each simply waits for the other to make a mistake.  I have not played 3 player enough to judge but it seems the board is too cramped.

I played this game a lot when I was a kid. I'd loose more often than not, but that didn't stop me. I loved the game and still do. It is a perfect example of a beautifully designed abstract game that is fun to play.

I bought it in a fit of nostalgia few years ago. My wife and I played it constantly for some time, but as our game chest has grown we don't bring it to the table that much any more. My daughter has been showing interest in it lately so it might see some action in the coming years as she develops the skill for more complex games.

The base game, as described, is a 5/10. Very draw-ish, and you keep running in circles until one of you makes a mistake. Too long, not interesting.

RATING: 2
Abstract version of Chinese Checkers where you try to push off opponent pieces.  House rule needed to win game after pushing off 5-6 pieces (otherwise the game runs on and on as you pursue individual marbles that you've broken away from the main group).  Three player variant may make this more interesting (but I doubt that). 4&5 player variant is simply playing teams (sharing marbles which is a stupid design idea).  Box is heavily worn and corners damaged but game is in good condition.

This is a very good game for what it is: an accessible abstract that kids and adults can both enjoy.  It's easy to teach and you can play several games in a row.  My seven year old daughter enjoys this though she's not that great.  It's very tactile.

This game is ok, but I think of it as the best Sumo wrestling game I've ever played...to me the different rows of color are like rolls of fat vying for postion and leverage. :)

Actually, this game has a downfall...you will probably discover the stalemate issue. It depends on how aggressive you are in playing really. If you tend to be a defensive player or cautious--and your partner has similar traits--you will end up in a stalemate fairly quickly as you will both be waiting for the other to make a mistake.

That sucks the fun out of it.

If you're both somewhat aggressive and play to win and not to lose (which you should be in any game) you'll not run into it.

The tactile aspects of the game are not only addictive but brilliantly designed as far as the physics of the game go. Big chunky marbles that slide around through little grooves, in linked chains, "clinking" you to your destination. I haven't enjoyed the tactile nature of an abstract like this probably since I first discovered Hive in all its Bakelite glory.

The game design is pretty cool too. People usually describe it as "sumo wrestling with marbles," which is an apt description. You're pushing each other around with groups of your marbles, trying to knock each other off the "mat".

RATING: 3
You push, push and push, and although the pushing in itself is not unpleasant, it's also not very exciting. In attacking you make yourself vulnerable, so there may be some action as one or a few marbles get isolated and their fate is uncertain, but apparently this doesn't happen a lot with good play.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent game of tactics. 

The board is moulded plastic, but with a rather elaborate space-age feel to the little wedges that guide the balls into the sockets. The marbles are glass and have a good satisfying heft to them, and they make a rattling click as they clink against one another.

Black starts. A move consists of picking a row of 1,2 or 3 marbles and displacing the row axially or transversely one space . In a broadside or transverse move all the holes into which the marbles move must be unoccupied at the start of the move. An axial move may push marbles belonging to the opponent if there are fewer of them than there are of the pushing colour. The pushed marbles may either land up in a previously unoccupied space or in the gutter off the board. Balls in the gutter count towards the 6 you need to win.

A defensive player who circles the wagons and never attacks can force a stalemate. The Belgian daisy initial position makes this kind of play more difficult. A 2-3-2 hexagon of black marbles in the left hand corner in front of each player is aligned with an identical hexagon to its right. This arrangement means that the row of holes closest to each player, reading from left to right, goes b,b,empty,w,w. The next row is b,b,b,w,w,w, and the third row is e,b,b,e,w,w,e.

Another way to prevent stolid defensive play is to agree that if neither player has pushed a marble into the gutter by turn 15, the winner is the player with the most marbles on the centre line and the two adjacent lines.

Positional play helps to ensure a winning strategy. The main aim is to keep one’s marbles in a close, preferably hexagonal, group in the middle and leave the edges to the opponent. While one only wins by pushing the opponent off the board, it should hot be at the expense of geometry.

I don't think there is much to say about this game - about anyone knows this one already. I like the simplicity of the game that still allows for quite some depth. It  is also my only 'modern' abstract. However the game tends to stall when players are too equal in skill level.

RATING: 6
Like many abstracts, it has only a small set of rules to remember, and it's easy to pick up and teach. But once you have mastered it, and your opponent has as well, a draw is all too easy to achieve. You either must wait for the opponent to make a mistake, or make a mistake yourself intentionally in order to end the game.

Have not tried yet the variations with three or four players, but there, I can see that the draw potential will be much lower.

Well. This I find the most difficult game to rate.
I have only played it a couple of times. And I cannot say i'm impressed with it.
Center and defensive player will win too many games. If both are manouvering for center and playing defensive this is easy one of the most boring games ever.
However victory can be sweet.
Not my cup of tea because you have to play patiently and counter attack. While I am an agressive player (that's why i like poker)
the agressive player imo has to be rewarded. It is he (she) who makes the game and calls the plays. and comes up with new strategies. It is he (she) who wants to win. Not just plays for a draw. 
Ok sometimes this calls for counterstrategies by their opponent. In a game like abalone where the center is such a strong position. He who's happy to wait and do nothing will win.

Damit es nicht schnell langweilig wird, muss man nicht unbedingt in gerader Richtung anschieben. Es ist auch erlaubt, Reihen parallel zu schieben!

Abalone is a good abstract; simple, unforgiving, and completely devoid of chance. It has a Chess- or Go-like quality, in that the principles underlying movement and so forth are easy to learn, but playing well requires some skill.

Unlike a lot of other abstracts I've played, the way my brain works seems to line up well with Abalone. Unfortunately, it gets stale after a while (especially compared to recent acquisitions like YINSH), and it's been many years since I played it. Got rid of it.

Abalone is a full information game with interesting mechanics. Unfortunately the game opening tends to be completely locked where both players sit in the center and don't want to spread out.

Maybe the last one of the abstract "classics". It came out after othello and it seems to have staying power, because it  is still sold in scores after almost 20 years.

However the jury is still out on it. The defensive play bias seems hard to overcome, even with the tournament setup and I am not aware of a big "organized" group of players. Is there any federation or a serious tournament scene ?

To fully enjoy the game I strongly recommend to play with the alternate starting position (http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/proprietary/abalonerules.html). The standard starting position too often is used to achieve a forced draw.

Abstract Strategy game in which balls are pushed around the board while you are trying to push off the other players color. Newer versions come with a football varient in which both players are trying to push off a single green ball. Takes a minute to learn but not quite a lifetime to master. An alright strategy game. The kids seem to enjoy this more than I do, the rules are simple enough for them to understand and if you are not playing completely cut-throat they will enjoy themselves.

Not great, not broken either.  The mecanism of the game is quite simple and can lead to a stalemate that will be broken by the first player.  Then, it's a matter of who will control the center of the board.

A joy to behold and even more fun to play.  Sure, there are some clinkers in terms of strategy (once you know some of the tricks, you can abuse them), but it is easy to teach someone to play and even easier to get them HOOKED.  I DARE you to play this (or Terrace and Icehouse, for that matter) in a coffee shop and not draw a small crowd or a line of folks waiting to play next.

Nice abstract -- the first couple of moves are crucical, and it seems as though the game can be over well before the last piece is taken -- the loosing player can't do anything about it but wait and hope for the agony to be over. Still, it plays fast and has some definite strategy, and it's fun.

I wanted to like this one, since the idea of "pushing" pieces of of the board seemed like a novel way of implementing "capturing" pieces. In the end, there seemed to have no real lasting power to this - not enough richness, depth or conflict to make me want to play past the 10 or so times I got it to the table before trading it away.

Clever mechanisms and elegant components but between equal players, the games have a tendency to end in stalemates where no player can break through without compromising his or her own position.

However, me and my friend did invent the alternative variant of "Abalone Soccer" (described in the forums), where a neutral marble (a football) is added. Basically, the football is pushed as a normal marble but carries no weight (e.g. three marbles can move together with the football against up to two opponent marbles) and the objective is to push it out on the opponent side. This variant made the games more open and is worth a try!

RATING: 7
The marbles were gorgeous and felt very nice so I initially wanted a set, but I can't see this having THAT much replayability, even with variable marble setup shapes. I could see this devolving to basic push and pull battles. I also think I just get tired of abstract games quickly once the novelty wears off.

Still, I think this could be great for a family or non-gamer friends/kids. It works your mind and its not as difficult as chess/go/etc.

You know, this game seems appealing, especially with those beautiful marbles, the easy rules and stuff, but there is one really significant bad side to Abalone: The game rewards passive play. Also, it suffers the same problem all other non-luck games do: you need to play on roughly the same level, otherwise it's not going to be fun for either player. And if you do play on the same level, it's going to be dragging. Expect up to an hour of play time. Not kidding!

Among abstract games, this is one of the most strategic ones. This makes it a real beauty for abstract games lovers.

I have grown a little tired of this game. With two experienced players analysis paralysis seems to settle, with defensive/conservative move more rewarded than risk-taking/agressive ones. Now I know that official variant of the game available on the website (in the form of different starting position) may be solving this problem. I am simply no longer motivated to try them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game has a great tactile feel -- it's just enjoyable to push the marbles around and off the board.  The gameplay itself is a little too cautious, in that aggression is generally a bad idea, leading to a lot of posturing by both players until someone risks acting (and is usually hurt for doing so).  There are also enough ways to reverse almost any given thrust and "absorb" an action that it's hard for me to plan ahead a lot -- just too much to wrap my head around, I guess.

Abalone feels like a beautiful, tactical wresting match.

I find it nearly impossible to think several moves ahead in this game, so instead I focus on creating strong formations, making this a more tactical and very visual game, which I love.

Also, the clacking of the marbles is so satisfying! 

I also find it aesthetically pleasing, and it's the only game I have on display outside of its box.

We don't play many abstracts lately, but I still have great fondness for this game, and it can take a game or two to really get into it, which is why we've added it to our 10x10 challenge for 2017.

The poor man's chess, this game is actually a lot of fun. That is however, until both you and your opponent become experts and this game turns into a stalemate that can only be won by the player who had the first move. It looks great though and really is a must have.

Edit: Forget the negative point from above if you have more than two players.

Abstract game. More fun when you don't think too much, though, and take some risks. Otherwise it can lead to a situation where both players realize that the best move is to wait for the other to move first...

A fun abstract strategy game for two. Deep and tactical, yet it doesn't feel dry as some of the puzzle-like abstract games. On par with some of the GIPF project games, while predating them by a decade.

Abstract game: Polaris - Abalone

Entretaining game where you push pieces around trying to knock them out of the board. A classic, board sports kind of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent strategy game for all since the rules are quickly learned/taught and even players that do not enjoy strategy games (like my wife) usually enjoy pushing the marbles. Although the two player game has potential to last awhile between habitual defenders or seasoned veterans, the 3 player cutthroat and 4/6 player partner games are usually a half hour or less. We would typically play 1 or 2 games during the half hour lunch break at my old workplace. It is also fun for coffee shop entertainment or even taking to TGIF's or Friday's which we would do all the time in college. Highly recommended!!

Parece simples mas é um jogo muito complexo, onde uma jogada em falso pode sacrificar um longo trabalho.

Abalone is a game with nice components both visually and aurally (the clacking when a large move is made is pleasing.)  It's the only reason it isn't a 1.

The only problem is the game completely drawish.  To those who say this a great strategy game--here's a hint.  Form a compact group with your pieces and try to force your way to the center.  And NEVER EVER EVER get foolish and actually try to attack.

The only way to lose is to try to win.  And if you never try to win, you can never lose.

Tournament setup only change it to a race for the center.  Still not a great game.

Suffers from the problem that rational play seems to dictate cautious defensiveness, so the game can draw out forever.  I have read that there are various proposals to mend this, but the game according to its rules that I've played is not very exciting for me, even ignoring that issue.  I wanted to like it more than I did.  It's playable, but there are so many more enjoyable abstract strategy games.

RATING: 9
Actually, a great game. Much like chess - simple rules which create tremendous tactical battles. It also teaches the truth of battle: massed forces win over scattered forces, but success with a massed force often leads to your force over extending and becoming scattered as a result! The other truths it teaches is have a battle plan - and realize no plan survives first contact with the enemy!

I played this a lot with my buddies when I was in high school. I bought it on clearance in a game store in Costa Mesa.

It's a nice abstract that has been overshadowed by the brilliant Gipf series of games. I'm no mathematician or genius of any sort but it seems to lack the depth of Gipf games.

It does have the trick board going for it though.

An abstract strategy game that is very confrontational ala [b]Chess[/b]. Analysis paralysis can set in depending on the players involved (just like in any other abstract strategy game this confrontational) but the short duration time keeps it from being too much of a drag. Very tactical, no luck (unless you count an opponent's mistake as being luck), every move is meaningful as it has an effect on the field of play, but admittedly it's somewhat cold (like many abstract strategy games can be). Still, I liked it quite a bit.

[b]Edit:[/b] While I still admire the game, I simply would prefer other abstract strategy games over this one...

Another game that falls into the category of pretty to look at.  It helps that it is a lot of fun to play -- at least for me.  As the game tends to be won by the person who manages to not make a mistake first, I find I often lose to competent players.  I really do not have the patience necessary to succeed.  I always am the one trying to do something a little bit different to break things up.  This is usually bad.

[University Games 1999 Travel Edition] {Abstract; pawn-elimination} Abalone is a mediocre 2p abstract game. It's about pushing your opponent's pieces out of the board with a stronger force. It can be learnt in 2 minutes for its simple and intuitive concept. It's easy to create handicap for different level of players - assign winning condition differently. It is thus a good entry abstract game for children. Deluxe version is preferred for kids: bigger parts, where are easy to handle and hard to swallow.

I was expecting this game highly but I am quite disappointed after several plays.  The strategy to occupy central is too important to ignore.  In most plays, who controlled the center of the board was the winner.  Thus, it is just like a seesaw - players move back and fro turn after turn. 

Abalone is boring because it favors defensive play. Since the game board is hexagonal, if a player wants to push away an opponent's piece, he has to expose his piece(s). In addition, Abalone tends to have a run-away leader problem because the losing side has fewer pieces (unlike YINSH, where the winning side has fewer pieces) and usually has worse distribution of pieces; thus, it's very hard to come over. Consequently, players tend to be defensive and gather all pieces together. It is difficult to lure an opponent to go near the edge, esp. when all pieces jam in the center (unless he is so foolish; but one won't play with fools, will you? :devil: ).  This makes the game run unnecessarily long. It'd be better to make it a timed-game that whoever loses least pieces wins.

The quality of the travel set is disappointing - the balls are hard to push and of different size. Deluxe version shall be bought if one really likes Abalone. At the same price, I would rather buy Blokus and Rumis.

Two copies ... Abalone Corp. 1990, thrift store French version from same period.  I've played a lot of games and always enjoy them,  I'm not skilled enough to find fault with the game play as some have.  We've two sets of extra colored marbles for additional players and expect to soon give that a try.  The board itself is easily used to play other games, such as Yavalath.  A nice looking game that's fun to play.

For an abstract game, it has many flaws, but is still very addictive and enjoyable. There's something nice about pushing all those marbles...
but when you're in a tight spot, it's very very difficult to manage to turn the tides; when marbles become scattered there can be several turns in which players do nothing but try to regroup, and therefore  the game can have some stalling moments. Not too brilliant, but not bad either. It cannot compete with the GIPF project but it's still nice and easy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
so far the game looks fun. It seems like the marbles will enter a blocked position but it quickly breaks apart as the columns cut each other part. we have not encoutered any stalemates. Often it breaks up into smaller factions fighting each other before they coalesce. Rating would be higher but the game is a little dry, so I am not enthused as much. But there is interesting play here you should check it out if abstracts appeal to you.

An oddly tactile abstract strategy game that has you using groups of marbles to push your opponent's smaller groups off the board.

The basic mechanic of pushing strings of marbles is clever and fun. Setting a trap and pulling it off is also quite fun. It can get a bit stagnate in the mid-game, however, if both players are reasonably competent. I'd like to try some of the alternate starting positions that are supposed to make play a bit more dynamic.

It seems to me that an unbeatable strategy (in the original 2-player game) is to be defensive - to wait for your opponent to attack you.  If your opponent has the same idea, then you have an instant stalemate.  On this basis I would rate it a "1".  But I won't, because I haven't tried the multiplayer versions.

Elegant! The rules can be condensed to only a few sentences, yet the gameplay is quite deep. Ends up in the category of other black-and-white games of this description, like go and othello. Unlike those, however, this one expands cleanly to four-person (2v2) play, which is our preferred format. 

We find that 1v1 games often devolve to a lot of dancing around until someone makes a mistake, at which point the outcome seems a forgone conclusion.  In other words, perpetual stalemate until someone resigns immediately after a single fatal move. Perhaps we are too evenly matched. Were it not for this degeneration it would probably compel a higher score.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great components and a very good game design. But for me it tends to become a brain burner when playing against a competent player (just like with chess). This makes plays of Abalone exhausting and because of that it does not get played as often as it deserves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I don't care if it's a classic or not - Abalone is way too static and repetitive for my taste. I love abstract games and I respect this design, but it just doesn't get me. The main thing that keeps me from enjoying this game is that it suffers from snowball effect - once your opponent gains upper hand it's almost impossible to surprise him and get back on your feet, you just get weaker and weaker and it's a downward spiral from there.

I think that YINSH replaces Abalone completely - it's much more dynamic, has variable setup and doesn't suffer from the runaway leader problem.

Abstract games are not my favourites and this one is solid but unexciting. I was taught Abalone by someone who seemed to have played the game all her life and could instinctively tell which positions and moves were strong and which were worthless. If you like abstract games where you can spend many years learning until analysis of board position becomes second nature, you might like this. Or you could try Chess.
On the plus side, the way the balls roll from one slot to the next, and how you can push a column along using one ball is very pleasing.

[b]GOOD.[/b]

Simple push-and-shove rules that can be relayed in a minute. Depth of strategy that can take many, many plays to realise and perfect.
I have enjoyed all the games that I have played of this, though some can take a while to play through with a thorough opponent, maybe too long. Also, if you begin to lose, the situation surely worsens; as your pieces drop in number so do your playing options.

[i]CLUNK![/i] The satisfying clunking of the balls is worth a high rating in and of itself. Abalone also looks mighty purdy on a coffee table; a trap to ensnare unwary non-gamers.

Try playing with the variant setups, Belgian Daisy or The Pillar; these can remedy the almost stalemate situations that can arise when two experts face off.

NB. If you are a newcomer to this elegant game, prepare to be brutally destroyed by a master!

One of those games with comparably simple rules, that nonetheless allow for strategic thinking and tactical calculations on a similar level to, say, chess.
Quite enjoyable, can be played with varying degrees of "seriousness" i.e. thinking time and concentration. Minor drawbacks: two player game only, and mostly tactical, less strategical (i.e. on a "tactics" scale I would place it between chess and go, and on a "strategical thinking" scale I would place it below both chess and go). Still, a solid game.

One of the best 'simple' abstract games ever created.  Can be taught to ages 5 and up, but winning consistently is something that takes time.

An incredibly fun and fast-paced abstract tactical game.  The fact that it can be played by up to six people ­ which, incidentally, provides a fresh excitement if one is accustomed to two-player games of Abalone ­ makes it even an option for parties; though the best way to entice party-goers is to get one other person to play it with you, so the spectators may be mesmerized by the organic movement of the opposing sides.  Then, when you say that up to six can play, the barb is lodged squarely in some cheeks.

Excellent game. Easy to learn, not so easy to master.

An abstract with a theme - pinned on. Limiting pushing to three stones and the victory condition seem somewhat arbitrary.

However, it is nice that pushing and shoving goes in six directions. Gameplay is fun.

P:S., an abstract is an abstract. Representation matters little to me. I own the travel edition, and in this case, the components are quality indeed.

After 1 Play: I so wanted to like this game!  It just seemed to go on forever, with neither player gaining points or improving their position such that they had any reasonable chance of doing so.  After some time I started playing sloppily just to get the game over with.  I love the look and feel of the pieces--just wish they came with a decent game attached.

(silence)... "klack"... (loong brainwrenching silence) ... "klack" ... (neuronaltwister serenity) ... "klack"...

Just not my type of game...

Abalone and myself, we've never really clicked. I'll have to try Yavalath though.

Good abstract strategy game.  Beer proof and small footprint make this a good one for bars/ coffee shops or the front porch.  

Like all good abstracts the rules are simply but after a few plays the strategy mutates and the depth really shows.

I used this part of my brain (which this game needs) while playing Master Mind long years ago. Not a women's game, only if you are a female who liked playing Master Mind. :)

This is my favorite abstract game in the "sumo-style" family of games. Attractive, easy to teach and play, but engaging and satisfying.

Exceptional return of Necromunda. Little bummed we don't have gangers, but the chance to actually play 40k factions is enticing, especially as someone who never wanted to shell out hundreds of dollars for a 40k army. 

The slightly massaged rules are great, and the game still holds up. The boxed set is really mostly about the magnificent new terrain GW is releasing.

It's necromunda, but with a scaled down campaign, but all the factions you love.

Lucky enough to trade a favour (Millennium Blades) for a preorder, and extremely glad I did. The modular (and easily re-configurable) nature of the scenery is beyond reproach, and worth the price of the boxset alone. The two factions included are so-so, bog standard space marine scouts vs. orcs, with boring stock weapon options... But the rules and range of alternate warbands already released. That is where the game truly shines. [edit - a fter a few plays, it is interesting to note the difference in play tyle offered by these two defaults]. Pretty much a straight re-release of the classic Necromunda - a game I did enjoy in the mid 90's upon its first release - the few refinements offer very little to criticise. If pushed, I would say the XP system could have been implemented a little better, awarding points for following operational roles and rewarding outstanding feats, and a few more rules for engaging with the scenery (e.g. a chance to burst steam pipes, cause huge electrial shorts, breach the furnace walls to spill out molten metal...) but these are both easily houseruled. An outstanding release, that easily satiates the small scale skirmish game hole in my collection. I will be adding new teams to this whenever I have a little spare in my gaming funds...

Burn all of your sorry little Kickstartered "kind of like a miniatures game" skirmish board games. You don't need them anymore. The best game of 2017 by a long shot.

Necromunda's back!

RATING: 7
The game is good because it is Necromunda and the game is bad because it is not Necromunda. Shoehorning 40k units in feels forced, like something rushed to market to fill a production gap when Adeptus Titanicus slipped. I don't feel the factions are really balanced. I don't feel that taking a system based around scrub street fighters and working in trained fighting units that are well supplied. So the game is solid because it was based on a solid rule set. But the game is also week because it deviated too far from said rule set.

A higher-production version of Necromunda that lets you use your armies from 40k. A weaker campaign system, but less fiddly as far as individual rules go. 

Mix and match to create the ultimate gang-war skirmish game!

Will probably put together a Gretchin/Ork team and maybe Chaos cultists.
Looking forward to messing about with it.

I just own the rule book and several of my own skirmish factions, not the box set itself.

Good streamlined version of necromunda.

Lovely boxed set and the new factory terrain that GW brought out for this is great.  The game itself is fun although in my opinion the engine is starting to show its age.  Also doesn't really handle more than 2 players well and most of my skirmish gaming is done with multiple players.

Just paid for collection tomorrow at Patriot Games in Leeds, following multiple attempts to order a copy elsewhere!!! Hyper excited and hoping it really is the new Necromunda. Looking forward to a new skirmish game harking back to early rogue trade 40K rather than the sprawling game it's become. Just wonder if we will be getting gangs in future, here's hoping! Based on how quick it sold out looks like they've massively underestimated the popularity and hope this convinces them to give it full support. Like many others I'm liking how specialist games is shaping up, more like the good old days of GW (excuse me while put rose tinted specs on)!!!! 


...quick follow up having given it a quick go today (using orks and scouts I already had) and it is what I hoped for. Immediate impression is it feels like early 40k rule set merged with necromunda, although I fully admit there's probably some points I've missed in my eagerness. The scenery is awesome, but doesn't appear have the flexibility, or the claustrophobic feel of the original card and bulkhead setup, so hoping see some expansions from GW (although plenty of third party stuff out there I know). Looking forward to painting up the scenery though, think it'll look great. 

...second update played this quite a bit more now and love it. The scenery really is awesome and more flexible than I thought originally. Kill teams are great fun and is a perfect mix of 40k and necromunda. Great stuff. 

As I said earlier I'd love to see some of the gangs return in future though as well as the kill teams, but as a skirmish based game I love it!

If you love Necromunda you'll love this.  Simplified campaign and changed gangs to kill teams.

Take a group of w40K minis and have a quick skirmish. Spice it up with skills and a story and you have a campaign. Whats not to like?

Components top-notch. Have Necromunda from back in the day, including all the cardboard terrain. As we mostly all now know, this is basically Necromunda with 40k army kill teams instead of underhive gangs, and fabulous plastic scenery. And I plan to use my Cawdor gangers as Chaos cultists.

This is essentially Necromunda(my Holy Grail) with 40k units, instead of gang members. Why is this game so good? It's fast paced, exciting, with endless customization. Wrapped in RPG elements, and an interesting backstory.

Kill teams (painted):
Craft World Eldar
Genestealers
Orks
Space Marine Scouts
Necrons

Necromunda classic style rules, with normal armies, supplemental free rules to add listings for most 40K armies, playable with a single troop box. 

Squad sized, objective based combat with campaign advancement, I love all of those things.

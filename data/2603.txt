I have lots of cards from the first half (minus the elven one I forget which)

I played all 50 of those game before I was 12 years old,
I mostly liked collecting them because those were the BEST Movies of all time.

I really dig this game.  The way each player controls both good and evil is pretty exciting.  Deckbuilding is also part of this TCG that keeps me coming back.  I never did tournaments, just played casually with friends, but I'm still grabbing up cards 5 years after they stopped printing them!  

The three movie blocks and expansions are the best in my opinion.  Shadows and onward lost a lot of momentum when Decipher tried to streamline and revamp the game (towards the end of their licence on LOTR intellectual property).  Never got into Reflections either, seemed expensive & confusing.

Anyway, I'm a big fan of this game, happy to help out any newcomers with general questions and card-buying tips.

I am not the king of all TCGs but I did play Magic for a solid year.  Given that, I did not find anything compelling in Lord of the Rings TCG.  Gameplay was pedestrian and pretty tedious with little to evoke the spirit of either the books or the movie.  I gave it a shot, but it did nothing for me.

Very good game.  Beautiful cards and solid system.  However, the design of your deck seems slightly more important than the decisions you make during the course of the game (meaning that the game kind of plays itself).

Excellent group game of 4.  Especially you are a fan of LOTR.
We always enjoy a group game with 3 to 5 players (the fellowship of the shadow players XD). Got only first two sets and a few 3rd and 4th. Thanks to Johnny for some boxes of LOTR cards. Now my group grows up to 7-8 people and we have constant gathering for this!!!

I very much enjoy the Fellowship of the Ring and the Mines of Moria expansion set for LOTR.  The game then gets way too complicated for my short attention span self to follow the ever changing rules (what are you if you are bound or unbound?)  I very much enjoy playing this with friends and my children and feel that it has deepend my sincere enjoyument of the Lord of the Rings story enjoyment.

Played using a friends copy when this came out. I preferred I.C.E edition of Middle-Earth CCG. This movie version had stunning art from movie stills, bt much of the best in the system was modelled on the earlier CCG.

Like most CCG's, it was fun initially, but then gets out of control with the number of expansions and people building killer decks.

It was a great CCG in its heyday. The system of having your deck split into Fellowship and Shadow cards, while playing Fellowship cards on your turn and Shadow cards on your opponents' turn was a lot of fun. Thanks to the twilight system, where playing good cards on your turn was giving power for your opponent to play his, the push your luck element was very clever. The decision to move forward to get to the last site on your journey or take a break and let your opponent to move forward with his fellowship in a race to the finish line, never came easy.

RATING: 8
An amazing card game as long as you only play with the first block (sets 1 - 3).  Mediocre for the next few blocks.  Sets 10+ are for shimming wobbly tables and throwing, en masse, into a washing machine to find out what happens to a bunch of cards in a washing machine.  On an unrelated note, throwing a bunch of cards into a washing machine doesn't magically turn them into a good game, sadly.

I love this game. The first 3 sets (Fellowship, Two Towers & Return of the King) are excellent. The sets that came after are not...

I have played a couple of CCG's (incl Magic) and this is the best. I wouldn't rate any of the others higher than an 8.

I think the rules are easy to learn, if you are an adult. ;) I can see people complaining that it's expensive, but you really don't have to play only with rares. Very often the commons are as useful...

After this game had a promising start with the initial set and some nice pre-constructed starter decks, I really came to loathe and despise it in pretty short order. Decipher is known for their gouging rarity schemes, and Lord of the Rings is a case study in how to design a game to force players to spend more money. Each new set has hosers in the commons to make previous sets obsolete and new, powerful rares. Common hosers (like the Balrog) have to be defeated but can only be worked around by 5 or 6-rare combinations. Rares are generally just stronger than commons, and work best when you have large numbers of rare cards working in combination. I finally came up with a deck that could compete with my big-spending opponent ... only to have him inform me that the key uncommon I had been using was banned since, I guess, it wasn't rare. This is the game which had by far the strongest link between money spent and winning percentage that I have ever seen. All this, and a classic euro pasted-on theme. Just awful. I was spoiled by the gamer-friendly Middle-Earth CCG (of which this is no more than a pale shadow), where plays requiring combinations of rares were very uncommon and competitive decks could be built out of 90% common and uncommon cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think this was a realy cool TCG I loved the idea of having a deck of goodies and baddies at the same time and how by playing out the goddies from your hand this provided the resources for your opponent to play out his baddies. I think this mechanic could have been used in the call of cthulhu LCG which would have fitted the theme much better in that particular game. Anyway LOTR CCG is highly recommended.

Got two starter decks for this game and tried it out. Very tricky to get the fellowship to the ninth site to win the game.

I went on a rampage early on, but have since tapered off and I think I'm pretty much done with the whole CCG thing.  That being said, I did enjoy this game more than most of the other CCGs I played (Harry Potter, Star Wars) though not as much as Mythos.  I think some of the low rating is just my bitterness at CCGs in general.  Mythos was a great deal of fun, but I'm a sucker for the Lovecraftian theme.

Looking for offers of a full USPS fixed-price box of cards. This would be approximately 2,800 - 3,000 cards. Offered lots need to include at least 120 Rares. 

Only interested in cards from the following sets: Shadows, Black Rider, Bloodlines, Expanded Middle-earth Deluxe Draft Box, The Hunters, The Wraith Collection, Rise of Saruman, Treachery and Deceit, and Age's End. 

Can be combined with cards from other titles in which I am interested to get a full box (but should still have an appropriate mix of Rare cards). 

Not really interested in this one until the boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins (but wanted to go ahead and add it to my list so that I do not forget) and I can obtain in bulk. 

Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff). 

Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 4:1 (4 LotR for 1 MtG).

This just didn't sit well with me, and I regret my purchase of two starter decks.  While the game plays decently with just starters, I feel LOTR TCG is simply too damn complicated by needless combat and other "RPG-esque" elements.  There's too much to keep track of, in my opinion.  The "adventure" theme is bogged down in typical CCG-style mechanics.  Decipher gets points for design, a few interesting rules, and workable (not wimpy) starters, but it reeks of typical, mainstream gaming (i.e., collectible, too much to do, big and garish)

RATING: 9
Production: The cards feature clean images from the films that look great.  Even the shots not taken directly from a film look authentic.  The iconography is very clear.  The use of bold-faced type on various keywords helps make them easy to use.

Unfortunately, the text on an opponent's upside down cards cannot be easily read, and one must continually recalculate values to determine a companion's or minion's strength, considering all the effects in play at any given time.  And before any action can be taken one must examine all of one's cards, to ensure that nothing is being overlooked.  This makes the face-to-face plays quite tedious and slow.  Additionally, the rules are overly complex for the quantity and quality of decisions to be made.

Fortunately, the computer version solves most of these issues.  All cards are upright and can be enlarged.  The computer progresses through the various phases and highlights cards when they may be played.  As strengths, vitalities, fierceness, and other statistics are modified through the play of cards, the computer indicates this on the card itself.  These changes result in much faster play, thus leaving more time for what are relatively simple decisions any way.

Play: In most cases, I will play every possible card in my hand, so really my actions are determined entirely by the hand I draw; but every once in a while an interesting decision will crop up.

The concept of Twilight is great, and does lead to some interesting budgeting decisions.  There are some opportunities for bluffing, and drawing out the cards of one's opponent.  And during a skirmish there are moments where the outcome is unknown, leading to a narrow escape or to the devastating loss of a companion.  The order in which skirmishes are executed can be crucial.

My face-to-face games have been with a few of the pre-constructed decks.  I've played 100+ games against the computer using the tutorial program, which features modified Two Towers starters, and so I've come to be very familiar with these two decks, and quite fond of them.  I don't have the desire to spend a lot of time building my own decks, but a pre-built, synergistic deck is just the thing.

Although playing the game requires very few decisions, I can consistently defeat the computer, and it doesn't appear to be making blunderous moves, so I think there are definitely some wise choices to be made.  When the game moves along at a good speed, it can be tense and entertaining.  Face-to-face games are slow and not too fun.
Vs. Computer: (3+2+4) (260+ plays)
Face-to-face:  (2+2+3) (6 plays)

RATING: 7
With each card bearing a scene from the recent movies, the production values on this game are high.  One of the few CCG's that work well with multiple players, the game centres on each player building and running a unique fellowship up a track of 9 locations whilst simultaneously interfering with his opponen ts attempts to do the same.  Three core packages, each made up of 3 sets, cover each of the films and, whilst they can be mixed, the game plays better if you stick to a single 'film'.  The game presents the player with many, many strategies from stealth to outright war, with no single strategy being proof against all comers.  A good game with many choices spoiled only by the fact that the pre-done starter sets aren't really ready to go in the same way as Migic etc, requiring new players to buy extra cards to make viable decks before having gained the experience to do so.  Still, hours of fun for us Tolkien nuts :o)

Fair. Liked this quite a bit when it came out.  A few of us at work were into it, so we had a decent player base.  Then I moved and had no one to play with, and would rather have played something else rather than go through the trouble of relearning the rules and then teaching them.

Had horrible power creep in the expansions.

This game has a wonderful mechanic for threat generation. The more you spend on your fellowship turn the more threat you generate for your opponents shadow turn. 

This leads to interesting games as, do you try to stealth through playing very little but generating very little for your opponent to spend, or do you kit your guys up to the max and try to plough your way through all the generated bad guys.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game can actually be pretty fun, and my main complaints about it boil down to "It's not the Middle-earth CCG."  That rankles so much because the games share a co-designer, and this game co-opts a lot of the older game's better ideas.  The "twilight pool" mechanic is actually pretty neat, too.  But, never minding the fact that you're all running your own very disconnected race, or that this is based on the movies rather than the books, there's the problem that Decipher was still pretty cheesy about making lots of "chase" cards--not as evil as with the Star Wars card game, but pretty avaracious nonetheless.  Worse, instead of getting more interesting with each movie release, the game felt dumber and dumber as the abstractions piled up.  The only reason I played this game much at all was because MECCG was out of print and opponents for this game were much, much easier to find.

Played this a lot when it came out and I still think it's a really good game, although I haven't played it for a long time.

The Iron Crown game was better.  Too many overpowered rare cards, already a 'standard' game with banned cards exists.  Doesn't capture the feel of the books and only of the action scenes of the movies.  Banning the first 3 sets (ie. the first movie cards) in 'standard' tournaments killed the game. Decipher is really going downhill.  

edit:  Above was written when the game was still 'new'. Well Decipher went on life support and lost the licence so the LOTR:CCG went dead. A shame really but the card value still seem to hold up in the secondary market.

The adventure mechanic really grabbed me. Also, the resource and card draw system are some of the best I've encountered. It's easy to recycle and reconstitute your hand if you have a bad one. You can usually play whatever you like from your hand, with the tradeoff that your opponent gets to play more stuff in response. It's a great system that promotes a lot of cardplay and avoids hand clog and getting stuck due to a lack of "mana" or whatever.

An interesting game...collectibility and Decipher's management of it has been a real letdown;  still, I wouldn't pass up a game of this, and the images on the cards are stunning.

A good time waster, especially if you can get a lot of cards for cheap off of ebay.  Heck even Walmart had booster boxes for $20 recently.


EDIT:  Yep, Decipher ran this into the ground.  And you know what?  The gameplay gets a bit repetitive after awhile.  Not terribly interesting.  As the heat with the movie trilogy wanes and becomes memory, this one isn't aging well, unlike Knizia's LOTR or Confrontation.  In fact, I'd rather play either of those any day over LOTR.

Honestly, Decipher is such a terrible company, they can't go out of business fast enough.

I have mostly cards from when it first came out - The Fellowship of the Ring set, along with some cards from Mines of Moria and Realms of the Elf-Lords, and a Gandalf box Deluxe starter set. I played a Nazgul themed deck so I had all of them (including rares), all three elf-rings, Galadriel, Elrond,Gandalf, Gandalf's Staff, Glamdring, Boromir - as Rares, not presets.  Don't play anymore, would love to trade it to someone who'd give the cards the love they deserve.

RATING: 6
Don't own any, but my friend has a bunch, so I use his decks or make my own with his cards.  I'm not sure I'm very fond of the need for dual-purpose decks (good & evil).  Although it's a clever twist, I'm more likely to focus on one or the other to ensure getting the cards I want to either race through to the end or hang back and squash the opponent's fellowship.  (Also, the game concept really doesn't apply so well after the first book.)
A game I'm happy to play every once in a while.

RATING: 5
I have only played with pre-constructed decks with this, but so far I am enjoying it.  There is a nice balance between the decks, so one needn't worry about investing a lot if they don't want to.  On the whole, a good game.  There is a bit of a learning curve, and with some games I think who will win can be guessed 3/4 of the way through the game.

I was BIG into the LotR TC;, then, one day, in the middle of a tournament, I became excruciatingly bored with the repetitiveness and I've barely played since.  Maybe I burnt myself out early, but the few times I picked it back up again, the love just wasn't there.  Decent mechanic, but not very "Tolkien"-esque.

There were some oddities in the starter decks we learned the game with.  The Legolas (Battle of Helm's Deep) deck said the starting fellowship should have Smegol, but there was no Smegol card in the deck.  The Faramir Deck (Ents of Fangorn) had two cards to buff Isengard trackers, but included no Isengard trackers.

Otherwise, the starter rules were easily picked up through the game play after taking the time to read the rulebook before starting.

RATING: 6

When this game first came out, I really liked it. The cards are beautifully done as far as graphics and screenshots go. The game felt like a trudging along a path to the end, fighting stuff along the way, and getting to play both sides was great (just like in Redemption). For this reason, even multiplayer worked fairly well. However, the system seemed to be set up for Fellowship of the Ring only. The changes that came about with Two Towers totally ruined the pacing for me, as well as cluttering up an elegant game, both in rules and the sheer amount of cards on the table. Add this to the excessive amount of rare cards, foil rare cards, expansions, banning and the retiring of cards only a year or so old, and it basically became a money pit that got progressively worse as a game. It managed to go from one of my favorite CCGs to a game the typifies everything I hate about CCGs. Still, they are pretty cards, and if you just play with Fellowship block cards, some very interesting decks exist. And of course, I love the theme.

I cant think of any drawbacks in this game. Rules are very thematic, you will struggle as the fellowship did.

A solid fun game.  I really liked the balance between the shadow player and the fellowship player. The problem with it is that it is meant to be played in blocks (3 sets of cards together) so your cards become obsolete outside of that block. And decks that don't play in a block can be really broken and hard for the shadow side to even make a dent in the fellowship.

LOTR: CCG has some great mechanics; the best being the reactionary resource called "Shadow" thats grows when the fellowship plays cards and moves.  This makes the concept of "mana screw" obsolete.

This is also a great multiplayer game and one of the few solid 3 player games.  

The first block was really well done (Fellowship).  The "Two Tower" block was not bad, but as future sets were released the quality of design went steadily into decline.  I don't think they designed enough expandability in mind and while the basic game was a brilliant the team's lack of experience showed heavily in later sets and paled in compairison to the MTG design.

I own more cards than I would care to admit.  In most cases I have 4  of every rare card and can easily field 10  decks.

LOTR TCG is a solid CCG (how's that for acronyms?). I especially enjoy the fact that players' decks contain BOTH Shadow & Free Peoples cards and the mechanics of the Twilight Pool.

RATING: 2
Another Decipher TCGs that brings the movie characters and plot points into a playable game. Sadly, though, with a year between movies, this took too long to get enough cards to really build up the challenge -- by which time you know it's not as good as previous games.

PLUS: brings in characters the movie missed
MINUS: not as good mechanically as Star Wars/Star Trek
BIG MINUS: TCG = money pit
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Underappreciated game which was weakened by later expansions (I guess that makes it a normal CCG).  Gameplay a little repetative but its very fun bashing the fellowship with orcs and nazgul and watnot.  Deckbuilding is reasonably straightforward, which is a bonus if you want to play casually.  Non-rare versions of all of the characters are available, so you can quickly play with all of your favourites, and decks can be built which cover every storyline.  Art is great.

At the beggining it was quite good game with decent pictures from movie. It had little theme (what else say about game where Frodo is running with host of anonymous Riders of Rohan or elves and not with fellowship) but it was some fun. Although problem was that cards were making too powerful combos (due to poor playtesting). this lead to rotating of blocks and Decipher was making stronger and stronger cards in later editions which make original cards weaker in comparison and forced you to buy more cards.

This game captures the theme of The Lord of the Rings very well. Players race to destroy The One Ring with the Fellowship.

UPDATE: Here's a great example on how to ruin a game. After multiple rewrites, most of the original cards were deemed non-usable. I understand that 'evolving' games have to shake it up to keep interest growing but to punish those that cannot afford to spend 300 bucks each time a new set comes out is irresponsible. The game got weaker and suffered. I have given up on it. I keep the 6 rating (which has fallen three times since I first wrote this review) merely out of fond memory for what once was. 
ORIGINAL WRITE UP: Great multiple strategies and I like the mixed good/bad so that card draws and deck manipulation can be key. Any time a game makes you sit forward on your seat with anticipation at the end of the game, I know that it's doing something right.

Very good game, one of the few excellent 2 player games out there. not much luck involved but it does take time and money to build decks. Played competive for a while and enjoyed it.
Game went savvy after the two towers series with the return of the king series and it seems like it just died after the release of mount doom

I love this game!  I have never yet playing with someone else who had their own collection, though.  My friends and I just build decks using MY collection and play that way.  It's fine though, since I have over 7000 cards, now!

The game was pretty fun for the first few sets. After that Decipher kind of did what they did with Young Jedi, reprinting the same characters with slight differences. Later on they decided anyone could be a ringbearer and the locations could be in any order. That suuuucked. Early game: 9/10, late game 5/10, I'll say it's a 7 overall. One more positive thing, I bet you can get these cards stupid cheap now.

RATING: 7
Mechanically very similar to the Stargate SG-1 CCG, it has the similar drawback of the 'theme' feeling only loosely connected to the gameplay. A BIG part of winning also seems to depend on the turn-order bid during setup, which makes it feel more like a 'push-your-luck' game. I'll still play if asked, but I probably won't suggest this one unless I'm feeling nostalgic for LotR.

2007/4 Anoter CCG.  MtG shines through, only this copy is worse.  You're alternating playing friend and foe, but with only one deck you're likely to be stuck with only one type of cards on hand.  Making a mistake early on ruins your game as you're forced to move along the track bringing on more foes.

Nails the theme, nails the characters, and mechanically sharp as tack in parts (corruption, archery, and the shadow pool stick out for me). If I still lived near my friend Pat, we would no doubt still play this everyday. As it is, we try and break it out for a weekend of deck construction and rabid play every few years. The pinnacle of CCGs, in my opinion.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Auf das Herr der Ringe Sammelkartenspiel bin ich leider erst recht spät aufmerksam geworden. Positiv war zu der Zeit, dass man die Booster Displayfür einen Apfel und ein Ei bekommen hat. Negativ war, dass es sich dabei nur um die "gängigen" Editionen gehandelt hat und man kaum eine Chance hatte, an die zuletzt erschienenen Karten ranzukommen. Aber zurück zum Spiel:
Das Konzept ist klasse, denn die Spieler müssen 9 Etappen auf dem Weg nach Mordor überstehen. Das Deck der Spieler besteht dabei sowohl aus Gefährtenkarten, als auch aus Gegnerkarten, da die Spieler sich, mit ihrem Weg nach Mordor, abwechseln. Dadurch ergaben sich vielfältige Deckmöglichkeiten und Strategien. Dadurch das das Spiel aber nur auf den drei Kinofilmen basierte, hatte es ein großes Problem: Das Bildmaterial war natürlich beschränkt und ziemlich häufig hatte man den Eindruck, das Bild und Kartentext nur geringfügig zusammen passten.

I have been accused of being a bit of a Decipher fanboy.  Guilty as charged.

Having said that, this is a pretty solid CCG that serves the theme well.

Personally, The Fellowship Block was my favourite period when looking back on things, perhaps because of pretty Arwen, but every release cycle was very well done.

Recommended.

A LoTR collectible card game. Cast characters, but the opponents get to use casting cost against you. You are playing both the fellowship and shadow player at the same time; advancing when you are the fellowship or launching attacks on your opponent when you are in the shadow phase. I had high hopes after spending $50 to get 2 starter decks and 8 boosters. But like any CCG, it is still not quite enough (I didn't get any Nazgul). But there are some neat concepts in deck construction since you have to play bad and good, and the twilight pool is a neat concept. I just don't want to get sucked into spending money on a CCG like Magic again.

While I like the play of the game, the CCG drawbacks are quickly becoming self evident. He who can outspend his opponent has the deck building advantage which tilts the odds in favor of the big spenders. It's just not possible to be competitive with a few starter decks and boosters when your opponents buy box after box of boosters. Now I remember why I quit playing CCG's.

I have only played the game two times.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the amount of rules is a disadvantage.  However, by the second time I played, I seemed to have a much better feel for the game, though I wish I could find more people to play it with.  I don't know of anyone in my area who plays it regularly, so I bought an extra starter and some boosters so I could try to get my friends to play.  I am giving it a 6 because I liked it the few times that I have been able to play it, but I still don't have a substantial overall feel for it to make the rating any higher yet.

RATING: 8
The best Multiplayer CCG I have ever played.  I am fortunate to have a friend who enjoyed it so much that he spends literally hundreds of dollars on a regular basis to collect all the cards he can for this game. 

This game has incredibly unique gameplay mechanics wherein the active player assumes the role of the Fellowship, struggling to move from location to location in an effort to get to the 9th site which signifies the end of their journey.  Meanwhile, his opponents play as the Shadow, and collectively try to stop him.  As the active player rotates around the table, each player must decide how best to use his cards to ensure that he is the one to make it to site 9 with the ring.  

I could go on forever, but suffice it to say, this game is great and nothing like it exists today.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I really got into this when it first came out, though I'll admit to being a pretty big LOTR nerd, and much of that was probably movie version anticipation. Many of the mechanics were interesting, such as the extensive keyword based card interactions, the "race to the finish" theme, and the twilight pool mechanic. That being said, I found that the appeal was gone pretty fast; there just didn't seem to be enough real depth to the strategies, and it really seemed to lose steam in my area past the third set or so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this probably more than any CCG other than Star Wars.  Essential to play with some decks that are evenly balanced, otherwise it's just a big joke (aka. any CCG).  One complaint players have is that it's hard to catch up if your opponent runs ahead.  However, I think that's the point, it's supposed to be a race to Mt. Doom against the forces of evil.  Good themeing in my book.

After SWCCG went out I promised I would be done with ccgs.  Well, then this one came along and I couldn't help myself.  The mechanics and gameplay are superb, and for someone who is a totally Tolkien addict like myself, it is a must have geek out game.  There is heaps of strategy to building decks, and with the bajillions of cards you can make endless amounts of new decks.  Even nowadays I might look through my cards and see some combo I never noticed before.  Having a buddy who is just as into it is a must or you'll be building decks for both players, which is a bit unfair for the other guy.  The best part about this deck which sets it apart form other ccgs is the multiple victory conditions and the fact that players get to be both good guys and bad guys depending on whose turn it is.  The interplay between which two types of decks you build together is a whole other level of strategy.

initial releases rating of 9:
Wildly popular for a while but interest has waned since the movies have passed.  A great game. But dag if it ain't expensive to stay competitive!
The game itself is involved and fairly flexible for a card driven strategy game.

Revised rating of 5.5

The later expansions really muddied the game play and Decipher had to clarify a bunch of "rules" and game mechanics; later 'broken' cards lead to rules errata and banned cards.
As the company underwent criminal embezzlement investigations, they rushed out the final 'block' of the expansions and the game was hardly recognizable.

Used to be my favorite CCG before Cthulhu came along.  Its a great game with really innovative mechanics, especially the balance inherit in the twilight pool resource system.  Also, I love that you play as both good and bad, a definite plus over most good guy vs. bad guy CCGs.

Decipher ruined the game, in predictable fashion, but I don't think there's ever been a better "first year" of a CCG that I can remember.  I *lived* this game my senior year of college.

RATING: 7
Me and a friend did a crazy buy: 104 (!) boxes (52 each, 8 Euros per box); we completed the first 10 sets of the game in multiple copies, so with a so HUGE amount of cards we created about 40 thematic (and quite powerful) decks, exploring quite all the game synergies. I also bought for a few bucks 'Black Rider', the 'Wraith Collection' and 'Ages End' sets.

I consider this game as one of the worst CCG I played in my life. May be fun ONLY if played as casual.
I note so many 'technical' problems inside the mechanics, especially for some cultures; some cards are overpowered (but I'd say better 'completely broken') and some mechanics work badly against others, creating terrible nemesis between Fellowships and Shadows cultures. It's also plenty of all-or-nothing heavy balance problems/cards.
Considering the lenght of a single game, all this creates a 'doomed-syndrome' for the players, resulting in frustration the more of the times. 
In my opinion this game was not playtested so much (I'm tempted to say here 'at all').

I really dislike the artwork too - actor photos and, mostly, scenes taken from the movies are always a bad art choice for me in boardgaming. But here it's a matter of tastes.

A note about the (awful) rares system: I think this is the CCG with the most need for rares I ever seen; rares are essentially the core of every culture and often they are simply a stronger version of commons and uncommons (really bad for a CCG). In the time this game was 'alive' I can imagine it as a sort of nightmare to collect or playing it competitively. Sad.

Personally, I think this cardgame is even better than Magic.
GREAT fun, not too difficult once you know the rules, and original. The stronger you are, the stronger you make your opponent(s), so maybe it's better to take it easy for one turn. Also, there's only one good guy at a time, and the rest is out to get him! Should you survive, the next in line becomes the good guy, and now you can take revenge for him killing your heroes!

If you enjoy a collectible card game: this is the one for you. The gameplay is really great, the cards are very nice, and it's guaranteed for an evening of fun. Don't expect a serious game to last shorter than a couple of hours, though  ;-)

Game mechanics are pretty decent, although very linear.  It's gotten worse with the addition of new rules, loaded keywords, etc. Somewhat fun if playing with others of similar sized collections, but not if there's an imbalance in card collections.  There are also too many "power" rares--rares that you need four of to make a playable deck (ex. Hides for Dunland, Goblin Armory for Moria). This game seems particularly dependent on rares in general, thus requiring huge amounts of money to be wasted to get a competitive deck. I stopped buying/playing when Return of the King came out.

Too expensive for me right now, but I am adding to my want list so that I remember to pick up boxes in bulk in a couple years.    
Looking for offers of full USPS fixed-price shipping boxes of cards.  This would be approximately 2,800 - 3,000 cards.  Offered lots need to include at least 185 Rares.   

Only interested in cards from the following sets:  Shadows, Black Rider, Bloodlines, Expanded Middle-earth Deluxe Draft Box, The Hunters, The Wraith Collection, Rise of Saruman, Treachery and Deceit, and Age's End.   

Looking to pay about ""nn"" cents per unplayed (or played but mint) booster (a bit more for starters) [or offer ""nn"" cents per/booster in trade value if trading].  

nn = 21.  

Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 1:1 (1 of my MtG cards for 1 of your cards).

Offers to trade these cards can be combined with cards from other titles in which I am interested to get a full shipping box (but should still have an appropriate mix of Rare cards).  

Not really interested in this one until the starter & booster boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins and I can obtain in bulk.  
Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).

Great game that went downhill after the rotation of the first three sets.  Some of the gameplay changes were for the better, but the re-alignment of the shadow cultures was stupid.  Still, not a bad game to pick up for cheap:  I'd focus on Fellowship through Two Towers (skip Battle of Helm's Deep and Ents of Fangorn), and then Return of the King block.

Resource interaction via the Twilight Pool was a great mechanic, as was the melee system.  Fun cards, easy system to mix and match different cultures.

All cards kept in binders since opening or if used in a deck in sleeves.  Most cards from the first 3 or 4 sets.  Nazgul, Mumaks, Ura-kai, and of course the ONE RING.  Many mythic rares and combo pieces. pictures available for serious inquiries.

One of the better CCGs I've ever played. It's nice that, this time, Decipher was able to 'finish' the series as the license ran out. Well, they definitely rushed it a bit, but after the heartbreaking conclusion of Star Wars CCG, any finality is preferable.

One of, if not THE, best ccg games, ever.  Best theme (LOTR, come on)!  Best mechanic (twilight)!  And great gameplay.  It suffers the same fate of most, if not ALL, ccgs-becomes expensive to keep up over time; but it is still a great game.

RATING: 10
One of the most balanced resource systems to date.  No other game has come close.  The more you aggressively you play offense, the more resources you give the defense.  It's genius.  Extremely thematic game as well.  You build a fellowship; you literally progress along a journey-path; your ring-bearer gets worn down by the ring; and you have epic fights.  Plus each faction gets themes that are uniquely theirs.

RATING: 7
With this game, Decipher has at last shed most of their CCG design problems.  All the most recognizable characters are easy to get, the mechanics are not laboriously obscure, and play in the game is at least as interesting as deck design.  Not as story-focused as the ICE game, but there is plenty of tension in the play, and one can get a little story back through theming of decks.  Still occasionally suffers from the bane of CCG play (the Blowout Victory), but at least the game is a short one in that case.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very unique take on the CCG.   I like how one deck contains both bad and good guys.   The combat is very unique as it is not all or nothing.  The game has a race feel.

RATING: 6
This was THE game I played in my teenage years, and it occupied my attention for 3 years. Come to think of it, I blew off way too much $$$ on this game, as Decipher is a complete cash-grubbing whore (even relative to other CCG companies). Love the theme, love many mechanisms (the amazing TWILIGHT POOL, the importance and danger of the double-move, the variety of deck-building strategies etc), but hate how so many cards hit the store shelves grossly overpowered, and had to be errata-ed or banned, instantly causing sizable losses in my binder. That just speaks to an inexcusable lack of playtesting. Also, foils were pretty crappy in this game. And the game truly jumped the shark after the 3rd year (when the movie tie-in ended).

I was pretty good at this game, and ranked 1st in Asia from mid-way in 2001 up till 2003 and beyond, when the scene died a slow death. I dare say I would have ranked much better if I got to play the top-level competition in the U.S., France and Canada, since my deck-building and card-playing skills were both top-notch (I knew every single card in the game, and never made mistakes during tournament play). But an ocean separated me from the hotbed of this game, and I never got to see how good I really was.

I have 8 constructed tournament-level decks still lying in storage and ready for casual play (well technically, 2-3 of them are good enough to win tournaments, and 5-6 will perform at around .500), or for whomever is interested in playing. The decks are all Standard Format circa 2003, up to Reflections (does not include Mount Doom) and are:

BLACK - Gondor + Rohan + Help in Doubt and Need + Allies / Southron Threats (strong FP, weak Shadow)
CLEAR BLUE - Gondor Knights / Corsairs (average FP, strong Shadow)
CLEAR RED - Rohan possessions + archery / Gollum + Shelob + Promise Keeping (average but fun FP, inconsistent Shadow)
GOLD - Dwarven possessions + drawing + stacking / Dunland anti-possession (strong FP, above-average Shadow)
GREEN - Gondor Rangers / Sauron Besiegers (average FP, average Shadow)
PINK - Gandalf Trust Me + sneaky Hobbits / Uruk archery (or Uruk Machines) (weak but fun FP, average but fun Shadow)
PURPLE - Gondor Noble Leaders / Nazgul beatdown (strong FP, strong Shadow)
SOLID BLUE - Elves + Gondor archery / Easterling burdens (strong FP, average Shadow)

My weapon of choice was always some sort of Choke and Denial / Uruk Beatdown (even way back, before it got in vogue and Moria was all the rage) in CLEAR RED, but I have dismantled it.

This was an excellent TCG when it was released, perfectly capturing the feel of 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. The game slid a little with the releases for 'The Two Towers' before going totally off the rails with 'The Return of the King'. However, the core game mechanics from the Fellowship and Tower blocks are still very solid. It would be good to make some decks for this and play it again.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  The game design itself is solid and has a lot of good mechanics and tough decisions; however, Decipher again chose a poor rarity scheme, plus the winning strategies were as subtle as a sledgehammer (at least through the first block, at the end of which we quit buying/playing).

and most of the expansions.  Probably deserves a higher mark but as with most dead CCG's they tend to lose their appeal when there is little chance of finding anyone to play against, this is the biggest downside to ccg's as if this was a board game the same set could be used by different players but ccg's rely on both/all players having their own sets.

Having played card games with my friends for the last 15 years, this is the one we agree on as being the best.

The game mechanics are novel, and perfectly replicate the feeling of travelling to Mount Doom. The option to 'push your luck' by moving two locations in a single turn leads to some magical, nail biting moments.

The multi-player variant is also strong.

The golden era for this game was the first three sets. After that, it was a bit downhill - especially when they decided to rotate cards.

Played this over Spring Break with a friend staying with us. I'd play it again if he wanted to, because he obviously loves it and wants to play it a lot, but I thought it was pretty mediocre CCG fare, to be honest. I'm not very well-versed in CCGs, mind you--I dabbled in Magic and the Star Wars CCG for awhile, and that's about it--but something about this just didn't feel too revolutionary. I did think the Twilight mechanic was clever; the Fellowship player essentially gives the forces of darkness fuel for spells whenever the Fellowship casts a spell, which is a nice balancing mechanic. But the whole affair felt very dry. And the fact that evil forces disappear at the end of every turn just does not sit well with me. I understand the mechanical issues present there, I think, and concede it's probably a logical game design decision. But it never feels right when playing, and it takes away any sense of triumph the Fellowship player might experience at killing an enemy. Not a terrible game, but it just didn't seem too special to me.

I haven't played this in a long time. Most of the joy of this game comes from the Tolkien world, which I love. The other source of fun is the opening of booster packs. "Awesome! The Witch King!"

This was really hot at the time the movies were new. The design of the cards is beautiful, and they manage to convey the atmosphere of the films quite well. The "twilight pool" mechanism seemed really innovative at the time, but has become a disappointment in the meantime: We felt that nobody was ever holding back their cards in order to limit the twilight pool. Playing cards is just too advantageous since it means that you get to draw new cards as well. The gameplay became a bit repetitive (fighting evil humanoids all the time), and the revamp from the fourth set on killed it for me. I'd play again, but it's not on my "hot list" anymore.

I thought this game was incredibly good at first, and it remains my favourite TCG/CCG, but keeping track of everything is rather clumsy. It plays great online, but purchasing "virtual" cards is too wasteful, even for me.

A good CCG with the mechanic of having both your Free People & your Shadow sides in the one deck.

My second best TCG game. Like the concept and the idea that each player have a deck of Free People cards and Shadow cards mixed up together forming a single 60 cards deck.

The most intriguing part of this TCG is the resource system, in which a player can play as many cards as he wants for free. The catch is that every card played has a value that is used for the opponent to summon enemies, that in turn attack the player's fellowship. It's a nice strategic wrinkle that adds a lot of depth to deck building and game play. 

Out of print, but it's fairly easy to find the first few sets on the cheap.

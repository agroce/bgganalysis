An amusing little distraction, but not something I'd be eager to play again.  It's just stacking blocks.

Nice pieces and looked very interesting but turned out to be a disappointingly simple "build a castle and knock it down" game.

Great customer service when I ordered this! The game itself is fun and reminiscent of knocking down your siblings lego towers... The dexterity element in this one is unique and quite fun. This game has also taught me to never pursue a career in civil engineering...the destruction to follow would prove quite devastating...

A decent, very well produced filler of building things with blocks and then destroying them.

The game is played in a few phases.  First, players get blocks and build something with them, scoring points for their build.

Then, players take turns destroying other players' towers with a wooden totem that you let fall, hopefully knocking lots of stuff down, as you score points for destroying things.

Lastly, players score points if their king and/or guard survive the destruction (each player has king and guard pawns, and will want to place them as protected from harm as possible to ensure their survival).

After three rounds of this, most points wins!  For a silly game, there is actually some strategy here.  You can shoot for a tall tower that scores a lot of points for building, but will be easy for others to knock over, or you can build a dense structure that scores few points, but is harder for others to damage.  Or, some degree in between, balancing build points vs. defense.

Overall, a good, but perhaps slightly dull, filler that anyone could play.

You each build a castle then you each get a chance to throw a wooden erection at everyone else's castles in an attempt to destroy them.

Needless to say this is the game which could define Essen 2014.

I could think of worse ways to spend half an hour. There is some childlike glee in building and destroying block castles. But there are also a zillion other great wooden block dexterity games I'd go to first.

Found this in Essen. When I saw people trying it I just had to join. Also had a nice talk with the designer. I immediately bought the game and expansion (the last one I still have to try).

A fun castle building and destruction game that have a nice scoring system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very simple idea, beautifully executed. I have only played with my kids so far, who weren't interested in the scoring. But I am more than just a little curious how this plays with grown-ups. 
Our gaming table was maybe a little smooth for this, as the foundations were sliding when my kids played. A tablecloth might be advisable.
Very, very nice components, of course.

RATING: 7.5
This game basically adds a scoring system to the two fun parts of playing with blocks: building stuff and then knocking the stuff over. And it works surprisingly well. I had trouble getting a good feel for where to place the wrecking ball thingy, but otherwise really liked it.

A fun idea for a game that feels relatively fresh. I'm not completely convinced, since it seems like a bad strategy to worry too much about your own castle's stability. If you just assume that your castle is going to get destroyed and concentrate on maximizing your build points, it seems like you will do well. I wish there was a greater reward for maintaining pieces on your foundation.

A really nice idea that one. Vaguely similar to Bausack, but with a destructive element. The rules need one modification (actually a single word added): When you draw new blocks, you must take different ones.

RATING: 6
This is a light-hearted little game. The scoring is a solid attempt to gamify the building decisions but, at the end of the day, all that matters is that you build castles and smash them down! The expansion adds so interesting variants.

RATING: 6.75
Actually much more fun than I expected it to be. There is definetely skill in this. Build a strong castle first is a skill. Second skill is judging the quality of the other castles: spotting and exploiting the weaknesses. Fun game.

RATING: 6.5
Plenty of nice wooden components and a simple game mechanic of building up a structure which is strong enough to withstand the fall of the wooden gavel.
This should appeal for family play. 
My only concern is that there are too many rounds for such a chaotic game. Maybe only play one round per game but more games?

In the build phase, I like the tension between building a tall and vulnerable tower worth many points, versus a short sturdy tower worth fewer points. (And if you build a tall tower, someone else may be earning some of those points when they knock it over!) It's fun to build, experiment, and decide how risky you want to be. 

Then, you take turns bashing each other's castles, which is just hilarious. This game produces a lot of laughs. 

The game also works to keep the competition close, by awarding the currently-last place person the opportunity to bash first (and target those tall towers!) and choose new blocks first (when it comes time to re-build).

I find that this game is fun to play with just about anyone. You can play with kids, adults, gamers, non-gamers, and a mix of all of the above. It's inherently fun to build and crush, no matter how "well" you're doing. You're inspired to try your best, but you can't feel too badly when things don't turn out for you. And cheering after a big or surprising crush is a hoot.

This is one of my favorites, if not the crown jewel of my collection.

A game I have wanted to play for a while. It look so cool with the blocks and trying to destroy other players castles. Not enough destruction and too much scoring upkeep. Wanted to do more damage. By the end I was just ready for it to be over. It wasn't enough dexterity for a dexterity game. I am not sure if that makes sense but it is how I feel. Super happy I got the chance to play it. I am not sure it is a title I would revisit but I would if requested.

Castle Crush! is a stacking/dexterity game where each player build a castle out of chunky wooden blocks before attempting to knock down the other players' castles with a wooden 'hammer'. I 'played' this a year or two ago and the rules were a total mess but the revised and simplified version works much better.

Demolishing and building top-table. Neat filler which reminds me of old tank game I played in a sandbox and swedish outdoor game kubb, eith a twist. Can be played with kids, in a boardgame club as well with in a pub.

There may well be a good game in this box, but we couldn't find it with the rules enclosed. I don't think it was a mistranslation so much as I suspect the original rules didn't have enough information in them to explain the game.

The castles hold together fairly well when under attack, so if anyone can ever figure out the rules, I'd try this again.

I have no idea how this game plays, but I understand that you smash castles by dropping your pieces on it.  Life doesn't get better than that.

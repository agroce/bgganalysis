I picked this up at the Dice Tower Con virtual flea market. I could see my rating going up with more plays, especially if/when I pick up a few expansions. The card decks for each character reminds me of Smash Up (not mixing and matching 2 decks, but having one deck that you won't go all the way through), and the card play is reminiscent of Star Realms. It might be a tinny bit longer than it needs to be, but it does feel like an epic battle with the villain. I still have not come close to defeating any of the standard difficulty 3 villains.

One of my favorite co-ops. The flavor of each hero and villian keeps it rich, and it is challenging to the end and all my friends love it!

Good game, although hard to keep track of all the damage modifiers and other book-keeping. Some characters are brilliant fun to play, some feel like you have to just sit there and do the same thing turn after turn. Love the theme though.

There is a whole lot going on here.  It's a co-op, not really a deckbuilder, not really hand management or even tableau management.  It's really coordinated action management.  It's challenging and incredibly interesting, I'm just not sure if it's fun (a whole lot of accounting has to happen as you play).

I like it, the puzzle of dealing with the villain each turn is very similar to the challenge of Mage Knight. I've only played it solo (running 3 and 4 characters), but believe it would be much more fun with more players.

RATING: 6.5
There is a game here, and I will find it. So far, I'm unimpressed, but see potential that other people have fully realized. I'm envious. I want to believe... and I think I may someday. 

As with Dominion, it took me a great many plays to begin to like the game. We'll see how this goes.

Probably one of my top five favorite games.  Fantastic cooperative, with HUGE amounts of replayability.  I have quickly developed a cadre of my favorite heroes, and a list of my least favorite villains, with my least favorite environments to put them all into.  Best part of this game is that each playthrough feels like watching a Superhero movie.  It's that vivid.

My favorite game ever. I love how each hero feels so different and how the cards are extremely thematic and you always feel like you're really fighting a villain. Everything feels like it's really in a comic book and like you're a bunch of awesome superheroes, I just can't get enough. This is my "must have everything" game, unfortunately for my wallet; there's so much variety, yet I want more, more, more! It's all just so good! Can't recommend this game enough!

RATING: 6.5
I'm a complete sucker for super hero games and all the more one built on independent works. So high praise for giving this game a very Champions-like vibe in hero construction. However, I don't think the game plays particularly well. Once you run with any one hero's deck of cards, I feel like I've seen all that hero has to offer. And the range of actions feels limited to damage or not - with a large amount of damage needed to run over the villain. In any event, it's fine and I can see why folks love it. For me, decidedly average in play but thematically a joy.

RATING: 6
I like the idea of the game. Had even fun playing it. However, I do not like that all information is written on the cards with a miniscule font that is hard to read. And what's even worse, all this written information is spread over a wide area so it's hard to keep track of things.

So, a promising game ruined by bad components design.

Another note: Game seems to be ridiculously hard with just 2 players only.

RATING: 10
This is probably my favorite game.  I am becoming a bigger fan of cooperative games.  I like the idea, the concept, the gameplay, the artwork, etc...  As a comic book fan, I like the how it flows.  The villian's levels are appropriate.  The first game I played we used one of the level 1 villians, and it was easy enough.  The second game we played against a level 3 villians and didn't fare so well.  I like the interaction between heroes and their respective players.  I will definitely keep investing in the expansions.  GREAT GAME

One of my favorite games, and one that i've been getting a ton of play out of. I've gotten more gaming joy out of this game than most of the rest of my collection. This is a great Co-op that can be played solo or with a group. Excellent theme that blends seemlessly with the gameplay. Exceptional!

Not all decks play well with all villains, you need to invest time, fail miserably, completely disappoint yourself after dealing with too much book keeping with those super powerful villains that you cannot shake at all. And then try with a different set of characters, rinse and repeat. By the end of this process the enthusiasm for this game was sucked out of me.

I have traded the game as I find it tedious and overhyped. A good idea creating its own universe and all but this game was released in pieces with v1 and v2 released too close to each other with as said earlier questionable play testing and many very unbalanced situations.  

I know a lot of people love this game but for me it was one of the worst games in my collection.

First time was fun, then as I added more plays it started not being as fun. I still enjoy it but for some reason it lost it's luster.

Edit: I think it's lost it's luster a bit for me for two reasons. I don't feel like you're doing anything really creative with your choices--everything is pretty straightforward and a lot of the time you don't really have a choice in what you do. Also there is a lot of cards that come flying out all the time and a lot of passing them around to everyone to read them--most of the game is spent reading the cards. With enough plays I think you can get around that one, but I have other games I'd rather be playing.

If ever there was a love hate game then this it.  Criticisms first.  The game doesn't scale well and words best with four players.  For 2 players I'd suggest choosing another 2 heroes and flipping them over to use their defeated power once per turn, i.e. they become your supporting side kick. This works so amazing well, and makes thematic sense, that I have to criticise the game designers for not suggesting this in the rules.  It's just lazy.  Speaking of the rules... oh the rules... 

The rules are horrible.  They are not clear and the text on the cards, although accurate, is not intuitive.  Most experienced card game designers try their very best to reduce the amount of text on game cards.  Sentinels actually added more text in the 2nd edition.  The solution was, rather than add more text, to clarify and make a better rule book, add some well chosen card symbols for common actions, and only use short unambiguous card text. This is unfortunate because underneath there's a fantastic co-op game.  

This is one of the few co-op games where a dictator is less of a problem.  There are so many cards and so much going on, it's almost impossible for one person to keep track of everything.  This means that players can make their own decisions without fear of reprisal or coercion.  It also 'feels' like a superhero game.  I don't beat a villian by having a card with a higher number, I use my superpower and hit for 3 lightning damage.

I cant quite figure out this game. This was probably the 2nd or 3rd game I grabbed when I got into board gaming. We have played it two or three times. Tonight was probably the 3rd time with the last time being close to 8 years ago. 

I am really struggling to put words to this. I think its too random to be a deep strategy game. I think its too independent to be a good co-op game. I feel that a players move lacks any real depth. And then add just enough vagueness that a game that should take less than an hour to run through takes almost two because every time a new card comes up its 5 minutes of reading and discussing the results.

We tried and just could not get going. I think my max damage was 6dmg and I am not sure I could have done much more than that. Honestly if I would have played different cards it would have not made a difference because the environment or the boss draw would destroy them. Like I said I am struggling to figure out my true issue with this game and just cannot. I think overall it will end up being traded or thrown up on ebay. Its just not for us.

RATING: 7
With 5 players way too easy. Some villains dont scale well with player numbers. Some heroes are also quite lame. You can only decide between doing 1, 2 or 3 damage. Not that many choices. The theme although is great and there is a hell lot of cards and variety. The strenght of the game surely comes from variety and not gameplay wise. For that the actual choices are far too few. But anyway if you can dive into the theme its entertaining from time to time.

I look forward to playing more of this.

Played once.  It felt like I was playing the Lord of the Rings board game, but less interesting and more flawed.  There didnt seem to be anything to stop the game from devolving into a 'best player dictates moves to everyone else' sort of false-coop that is really just a 1 player game where other people waste their time.  The decisions didnt seem very hard.  You do your clearly best move each turn, and then you see how much bullshit happens to you as a result of random card draws.

I dont really understand why people like this game, or why it has any good ratings.

I actually literally stopped playing halfway through, told the other players they could make my moves for me, and went and read the rules to a new game.

What a great game with a real Superhero - Comicbook feel.
The rules are simple, there is plenty of re-playability, and finally it is not a "who has the most money to buy every Expansion-pack for Deckbuilding" game.

One starts with a fixed number of Hero-Cards, draws new Cards every round, plays a power and tries - in Co-op with his fellow teammates - to build powerful "Power-ups" to damage the evil Villain and prevent his evil plans. 

Really worth the money. My son (8) loves this game.

5 average might be a little unfair for Sentinels. I could see my score maybe going up with another go at it, but my first play had a variety of interesting options being bogged completely down by slow mechanics on hard to read cards. And the balance was... I don't even know. Weird. 

It was pushing on a 6 decent for me but just had so much down time coupled with an inability to accomplish very much from turn to turn. Plus tracking all the little effects firing off from the environment and villain every turn...

Pros
- Superhero decks and they all play differently
- Villains with varying difficulties and themes
- The cards make thematic sense for the damage they do and how they do it
- Tells a cool story of a battle
- Simple structure of playing a card, use power, draw card
- Even though there's a lot of text at times, friends can ask for help since it's a co-op so it all evens out
- Glossary in the manual to clarify certain words
- Expansions add more variety and no more complexity

Cons
- It might get math-y at points
- A little fiddly, but the pieces and markers keeps that in check

A very nice co-operative game! I like that we are fictional super-heroes that remind a lot of the well known Marvel and DC ones! The variety is awesome if you through in some of the expansions!

Fun, though it seems to have some scaling/balance issues. Some characters are simply better than others and, at the max player count, I don't think we ever lost. That leads me to think that at the minimum count, you might never win. So don't expect your talents with the card play to factor too much into what happens, and you should enjoy it just fine. If that will bother you, however, probably this isn't the game for you.

It's a silly cooperative game. Language dependant so I can't get it to the table with some people.

Its biggest flaw? It's complex with very little depth.

The best? The game has a lot of replayability and, if you like the superheroe theme and want some game to play while chatting it's great. The base game has ten different superheroes to play, four locations and four different villains, enought to play a few games without having the same deck nor enemy.

And there are a lot of expansions in case it gets stale for you and your group.

RATING: 4
Despite being a superhero/comic books fan, the game was plain boring.

In short is: Play a card and adjust damage stats accordingly. Regardless if it's FIRE, MELEE or whatever, it feels like no substantial decision has been made. The game may also drag for way too long!

The graphic design lacked improvement, being polluted and confusing.
Even the iOS version feels slow and clunky.

Perhaps there are more interesting super heroes and villains in the box, but my first impression of Sentinels is that it offers few challenging decisions and is just a bit boring.

The card art is nicely done in cartoon-ish style and they pack a lot of cards into that box.

Cool fully cooperative card game. I like the quick setup and the easy rules. The game is very thematic and fun to play. Each player simply selects a hero and grabs his deck of cards. We then select a bad guy and a location to fight him at. The artwork is nice and there is a lot of replayability. 

UPDATE: I lowered the rating because I don't like the fact that the difficulty of the game is randomly set depending on the group of heroes and villain you choose at the start of the game. You have no idea if the group you selected will result in an easy game or in a difficult(almost impossible) one

Truly my favorite game at the moment. It is just a blast to play. It amazes me because it is such an imperfect game. The cards just make the game too complicated and there are way too many status effects and such to track at any given time. And I don't care. As fun as co op can be in my opinion.

Played two quick games and it's a lot of fun. In the first game the villain almost defeated us, we were one point away from disaster, but then it all started to make sense. It's a lovely game and with all the expansions it will get a lot of table time.

I'm sort of torn on Sentinels.  I think it can be fun, and there's some creative design in the different heroes, but I'm not sold that it's actually a good game.  The upside is that there are people in my gaming group who very much love the game, but I'm not sure I should be the one who owns it.

I liked the idea of the game more than the game itself.  I didn't enjoy having to remember all the modifiers that were in play each turn.  I can see why an app would be recommended for this, but that was just more trouble to me than this game was worth.

RATING: 6.5
 It plays well and is not terribly complex in any way. The rounds go by quickly. Though there is a lot of bookkeeping maintaining how many HPs everyone has and what modifiers are attached to whom. But it is full of theme and each character has his/her own story that you can meld into the game play as you like. Repeated plays of this have started to pull it down for us. Unless you play some of the easier villains it can become devastatingly hard. We might have thought before that this game was better than Marvel:Legendary but more plays of both games is changing our mind. While the theme is certainly stronger it may just be a bit too much even for a cooperative game.

Amazing artwork and the theme is fantastic. Props to the designers to create so many unique characters and give them all unique abilities.  

However, game play  eis pretty shallow and is draw dependent.  Only got to view 5 different characters in the game we were playing, but it seemed like the decisions were very straight forward.  

I'd play in a pinch if there was no meaty euro game out there, but certainly would never ask to bring it otu.

Oh, my word! What a great idea for a game...and I only just discovered it in 2014. Love the deep theming--superheroes, villains, and all the applicable tropes, comic book back stories--brilliant! The inclusion of environments in addition to heroes and villains is a stroke of thematic genius. It adds immensely to the buy-in on theme and dramatically increases replayability. The fact that it was a card game kept me away for awhile. Citadels, Oz Fluxx, and the like cured me of that aversion--thank goodness.

Rating based on one play.

All the different hero, villian, and environment decks were really interesting.  I wanted to to explore all of them.

But the game itself was just not very fun.  The basic gameflow rules are simple and clean, but there are lots of questions about how cards interact.  The biggest problem though is that the table fills up with cards and it's just a slog to remember and process them all.

And it mostly ended in a few incapacitated players waiting while the final hero(s) chipped a few HP away from the villian, and the villian chipped a few HP away from the hero(s) in a race to zero.  We decided to quit earyl instead of playing it out.

The only reason I could be convinced to try it again would be to explore a new hero deck, but I expect that I'd end up equally bored.

This is more or less the exact game I wanted out of a superhero card system, and the amateur artwork and unique comic universe give it a leg way up over Legendary or the others I've tried. The fixed deck mechanic is very welcome, each hero, environment and villain plays pretty differently from the rest, and there is a high level of challenge to most of them. Very high marks here, I am truly impressed and can't find any fault with this at all, one of the best games I own in any medium. And more importantly, REALLY fun.

This version of the game fixes EVERY complaint that I had with the 1st Edition. It's still co-op, it still has near infinite replayability (especially with the expansions), it still lets me save the world from dastardly super villains, and now it comes with counters for HP and it has a box that can hold everything. Greater than Games will have my business as long as they keep listening to their customers and delivering the fun, and this game proves that they are the quite capable of doing both at once. Amazing game, amazing company, amazing good times!

I bought this for boardgamegeek solo play challenges, and also to potentially play with my 14 year-old daughter, who is into superheroes.  Unfortunately, I found the game too difficult.  It is very hard to keep track of all of the effects of all of the different cards in play.   When I tried to play for the BGG challenge, I found myself having to quit and restart the game a gazillion times, because I would keep realizing halfway through the game that I forgot to factor in an environment card's effect or a particular villain card effect.   

I did get some enjoyment out of the game, and I may give it another try at some point.  Or not.

After searching far and wide for a good super-hero game this little gem appeared from nowhere and quickly filled that niche. Highly evocative of comics and appropriately thematic. All heroes and villains have their unique style and feel and the game is very good at wrapping it up together in team-based play. Goes much smoother with one or two designated players at the table assigned to tracking states, otherwise it can get overwhelming and mathy. Replayability is very high, with multiple environments, villains, heroes and even advanced modes of play.

Fun card game where a group of heroes faces off against one of several evil masterminds, of varying difficulty levels. Each hero has a unique deck of cards which they play to make attacks or give themselves or other players buffs, whilst the evil mastermind brings out strong attacks, missions, and flunkies to protect them.

Easy to pick up, quite quick to play, and the artwork is quite cool. I would say that the heroes aren't as well balanced as they could be, and certain combinations of them work much better than others. The higher difficulty evil masterminds are also almost tortuous to fight, especially if you haven't chosen a hero whose deck counters effectively. Still, it's fun and engaging, and good for the occasional play.

A very nice first play, with great colourful comic-style illustrations. This kind of games though, should be judged on replayability, of which I am not convinced. Have to play again.
2nd play- I have the same disappointment as in my first play: I find it difficult for all players to keep track of what all the active villain cards do and which they should target. It comes down to the responsibility of a "narrator" player to continuously point out and clarify the situation. I sincerely think a more centralized mechanic (perhaps a synthesis of the various villain abilities to a board with some tracks) would greatly help.

RATING: 6
This game introduces an original superhero universe where players attempt to defeat villains and overcome treacherous locations on their way to victory. The basic gameplay is simple and the barrier of entry is low, but once the game revs up there is a lot of book-keeping to manage and (with this enhanced edition) a lot of tokens hanging around your cards. The artwork is vibrant, though relatively weak (in my opinion) and combined with the simplicity of the ruleset the game can feel a bit homemade. Had it taken place in a more well-established universe like Marvel or DC, the game would likely have a more epic feel, but if you're willing to buy into a new universe that doesn't take itself too seriously, you should enjoy the game well enough - it's critically acclaimed and generally well-regarded for a reason.

I like this game a whole lot while despising it at the same time.  A love hate thing.

Very fiddly coop game that requires a lot of book keeping.  Easy to overlook some effect or to make a mistake while playing.  Fun experience for a coop superhero game.  Each character (villain, hero, environment) does play and feel different which gives the game replay value.

First Impressions: This is a highly thematic cooperative card game. Each hero has distinct abilities and uses in each mission. Unfortunately, some combinations of bosses and heroes are highly unbalanced. This can quickly result in cakewalks or in a futile game. Although I'm glad I had a chance to try it out, this is not a game that would jump at the chance to play again.

Got in my 1st two plays of this game and all i can say is wow! Instantly became the best super hero game ive ever played and maybe the best co-op game as well. I cant say enough good things about this one. Dripping with theme that all makes sense, and you get the feeling that you've played a much longer game in under an hour. But in a good way. Thats great because this one calls for multiple plays in one night. 

   Could'nt believe how much you got in Enhanced edtion box for a very small price. Lots of super heroes. The two i played tonight felt very different from one and other. Plus many villans and locations to play in make the replay on this one look very good. Can not wait to play again. Very happy with this game great job guys.

There is a lot that i like here but I do find it a bit fiddly and I do feel the AI system is not quite there for me and that can lead to wonky results (e.g. if you are not careful your suddenly against 100 foes or if you are and have a couple of global attacks it is easy) - still I like it but mainly I would play this if there is someone happy to be on top of the fiddle and steer us away from the wonky AI at its most dangerous.

UPDATE: Boring. I picked up this game before I knew the difference between this and a deck builder. This is not my kind of game.

I can't give this a score yet, but I did try playing by myself, by controlling two of the simple heroes against an easy boss.  I didn't do so well.  I know that games like this are not meant to be played alone, which is why I am not going to give it a score yet.  I can see it being a lot of fun with friends.  And I can see that it probably needs at least three people to really get fun.  I love coop games and I am starting to realize that I love deck builders.  I'll have to come back to this once I have had the full experience.

This is one of my favorite games.  It is fun every time.  The game captures a feeling of action and adventure that is unlike anything else I own.  In my opinion, the game plays great as a solo.  I play three super hero myself.  The game is cheap to get into.  The expansions are affordable, and if you get the base game, you will probably want an expansion or two.  I very much enjoy this versatile gaming system, and I will never trade this game away.

If you need variation to keep you entertained, there is simply no better game. As close to infinetly customizable as a game can be, every game will have a very different feel. Once you get past the knock-off superhero names, a deeply enjoyable and different game each time.

RATING: 8
Cooperative superhero game.  Heroes collaborate to take down a villain while all characters are effected by selected environment. Best when players immerse themselves in the unfolding story.  A decent solo game as well. Playing with four is a bit easy, play with advanced rules.

This game is very, very fun! But at the same time it is very hard! ive played only 2 character games so far and have never come close to winning. It's a very simple game that almost does not need a rule book, but it is wonderfully designed and feels very deep.

The artwork is great, and the lore of the game is interesting. The superhero theme shines through this game, even to the point where the villans slap the heroes around, and the heroes rarely win but when they do it is awesome. It's strange how you can lose and still enjoy playing!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game reminded me a lot of a typical party in any MMORPG game. There were clear roles that the different heroes took like tank, DPS and support. The scaling of the villain was good, though when we played it seemed like we took more damage from the environment than from the villain or his minions.

Despite the low level of complexity and lack of really hard decisions I do enjoy this coop. The theme is what saves this game. And the theme comes through really strong. The game itself is interesting enough to not enter autoplay mode. Like most coops it can turn into more of a puzzle experience. Good thing is that the players are always under pressure. This sense of emergency adds to the excitement of playing and probably is the reason I enjoy this at all. The game does not scale well for different numbers of players. So best thing to do is play multiple heroes if you're undermanned.

Incredibly elegant and fun, simple enough to teach, but has depth enough for multiple plays. It is true that the game can get a bit mathy at times, but I'm usually the one to handle all the numbers for it (on a seperate sheet of paper, for now). Just don't let a min-maxer get their hands on Absolute Zero. They'd love him to death, but there may be too much time spent on thought to maximize his potential (which is very, very high).

RATING: 7
I love super heroes and I love cooperative games, so I knew I was going to like this game. You'll have to forgive me if any of my opinions on it are a little off, though, because we played with some expansion elements mixed in and I was unaware of what came from what. I liked that you were required to plan where you would direct your attacks, and then there was a slow build as your characters gear up and become more dangerous. It did seem a little complex dealing with all the villain's stuff, and the environment stuff. At least one player has to be very fluent in the game to manage all that. However for the other players it can be straightforward, as they simply play a single card per turn. You could feel a little bit of the theme, but I could have used more genuine teamwork. Taking turns swinging at the enemy seems odd, and limits the amount of genuine cooperation. Obviously if it was licensed with real comic book heroes it would be one notch better, but it was easy enough to correlate these heroes with licensed characters. If the game was slightly more streamlined I'd probably want to own it, but with all the fiddly little rules to manage I doubt it would see enough play with my family.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
KNOCKING IT DOWN FROM 8 to 7 because:
a) I suspect it will be too easy
b) I suspect if I were running the villain deck, I would enjoy it less.
I would happily play Sentinels any time, but don't think I want to buy it or "run it" for a group of new players.

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of Sentinels, after one of my friends stated he wanted to play Sentinels.  

Some comments: maybe I would enjoy it less if I had to state everything the villains were doing.  I did enjoy the wide number of hero decks and the potential interactions between heroes.  We were able to play about 4 games in 2 or 3 hours and lost 1 of those games.  Sometimes the villain deck just hits you hard, it seems, which is fine.  I guess one concern might be, with a 75% ratio - is the game too easy?  Granted, we only fought level 3 villains, and no level 4s.

Might very well pick this up rather than the new Cyclades expansion.

I played this once with the least complex characters and liked the basic idea.  It seems like it could flow really well and be a fun cooperative, especially as all of the different powers and types of attacks become more important.  I like how the game builds up over time and players and villains become more powerful.  It seemed fairly easy for us 5 against 1 villain.  But, the game appears to provide a lot of variety and opportunity for customization.  I'd like to play it again.

Second play went well with 4 people and this game seems good.  I'd like to try it again with 4 or 5 players.  I think it might deserve an 8 rating, but I'll need to play more to know for certain.

RATING: 5
Very thematic with original takes on classical comic book hero tropes. Although it can be a little fiddly with it's bookkeeping, the game flows fine generally. However there is a feeling of just going through the motions due to little in the way of game mechanics preventing you from playing whatever you want in your hand. "Villian does this, I do that - villian does this, I do that" - etc. etc. until game end.

Meh.  I have not had a great experience with this game after 3 plays probably won't play it again.  Its too much work for what it is without good core balanced mechanics.

Regret having bought it.

A thematic masterpiece, Sentinels of the Multiverse is what in my (a laymanâs *) opinion all things superhero should be about: fancy names and costumes, random pieces of drama and background, larger than life abilities possibly comboing with each other for even more powerful effects.
The addition of environments and location-based appropriate conditions or opponents adds a nice touch to the game that even improves that thematic feeling: nothing screams superheroes like unwanted collateral damage.

-LOTS to keep track of, which can be irritating: you can easily miss something and cards could be better labeled 
-keeping track of HPs also fiddly

RATING: 8.75
This is a great example of a game that does nothing new but does everything right. The rules are simple, but allow a lot of space for meaningful decisions. There are heaps of card interactions between the various decks. The decks are dripping in theme, and the theme is married to the mechanics really well.

It's a superb example of what can be accomplished with CCG-like card interactions in a non-deckbuilding co-op. Scratches the same itch as LotR, but without the frustrations of building a deck for that game.

Its single biggest flaw is that it doesn't scale well at all - in fact, it makes no effort to scale. Most villain and environment damage seems to hit all players simultaneously, but a significant enough proportion of damage targets highest or lowest HP player, which means in smaller games the same characters will take damage more often. It wouldn't have been too hard to make both damage output and hit points scale per number of players.

EDIT: I'm trying to figure out how a team of relative no-names could have produced something this robust in such an under-the-radar fashion.

After 15 games - often three or more in a row because it's so short an so much fun - I'm staggered by how robust and internally coherent the ruleset is. Unlike most CCGs there are no complicated timing rules, and no exceptions for 'balance' - and yet the whole edifice is really well-balanced and contains surprising depth.

About the only thing I don't like is the number of cards that destroy equipment cards - there are three heroes that rely on equipment (ie are useless without it) - Wraith, Bunker, Absolute Zero - and they are disproportionately targeted by anti-equipment cards. Most of these allow you to take damage to save your equipment, but one or two simply eradicate your equipment, and with it all the turns of building up AND all your options for doing things on your next turn. Not so much fun.

I am now in a bit of a trap with this game - I can see it being fun pretty much forever. It's already killed off any interest I have in Lord of the Rings, and I think it might eventually get to the Race for the Galaxy level of plays, which is no mean feat. However, I don't want to rate it in relation to other games, because that throws the whole scale out. Still, it's a really great game on so many levels. Might eventually make a 9.

EDIT: Infernal Relics hit, and made the game just amazing. Bumped it to an 8.75.

This game is just fun in a box. It essentially allows you to play a CCG/LCG with three of your buddies together. Because the combos you make with your own cards and those of others help the team, you also get a high-five from the other player(s) rather than a crushed look. The fact that the game is able to incorporate ten different hero decks and allow a three to five player CCG with such streamlined rules is a thing of beauty (it's surprising that no one has done it successfully before). Some of the hero decks succeed particularly well in feeling like the hero they are supposed to represent. That and the whimsical art develops the theme and invites you to get into the spirit of the game. There are some criticisms that should be addressed. The game doesn't come with HP trackers or a mechanism to keep track of modifiers that do play a large role in the game. However, downloadable HP trackers are available and, with a few ten sided dice, the problem is solved. With regard to value, you are getting almost 600 cards for under $30. Some also have mentioned that the game doesn't scale well. This depends. The villains do vary substantially in difficulty and this information can be found on BGG. Some villains will play better with fewer or more heroes. However, the game is just as easily and enjoyably played with players controlling more than one hero (really). I enjoy SotM solitaire quite a bit for this reason, playing four heroes most of the time. If you like co-op games, CCG's, thematic games and the super hero theme, this one needs to be in your collection.

Update: The guys at >Games are nothing if not responsive to the game's fans. All of the criticisms listed above have been addressed in the "Enhanced Edition," which replaces the original. A fun game just got even more fun.

Update: Downgraded to a still solid seven (though I don't expect it ever to go lower). I sometimes feel like the game is "chippy," whittling away at numbers on the villain and hero cards - and the theme starts to slide off the experience. I love the idea and love the designers and still definitely like the game though I think there are more satisfying, dynamic co-op games out there.

Played a 5 player game vs. GloomWeaver. Played as Bunker (he was a bit boring) Game seemed rather easy. GloomWeaver did not get any relics out and we killed him with everyone still having over 10 health. Might have just been a fluke occurence. Will re-rate if played again.

I have changed my rating of the game based on my exp. with the app.  The board game is sadly very fiddly and takes to much time to setup.

The created super hero universe is awesome and it captures the feel of a super hero battle pretty well.  I kind of wish this was a competitive game instead of a co-op, for me usually playing co-op against the game isn't as satisfying as playing against an actual opponent unless its a big epic experience (a la Arkham Horror).  Also it felt to me like this ends up being too much about attrition- chipping away at each other and not enough big epic moves and swings in the action.  There's also a lot of data to track and while it's manageable, it's also somewhat tedious.  In the end this was disappointing and not fun.

I don't know... I certainly like the idea of a co-op game where I play a superhero and my draw deck is my suite of powers, gimmicks, and other resources. But I found that there wasn't enough variety in my deck, so I was stuck playing the same cards again and again. And playing the time-traveling cowboy, I didn't find much of any time-traveling theme in my deck. I suppose I would play it again... but pretty ho-hum.

RATING: 8
This actually belongs to my 7 yo son - a birthday gift from his grandparents (my suggestion).  He loves it.  I think it is a game that tells a good story, but is somewhat lacking in meaningful decisions - the best play is often obvious, and when it is not, the options are usually equivalent.  

But my son loves it.  He loves teaming up with me instead of competing against me.  He loves being a superhero, loves doing damage, loves that we keep winning convincingly.  This is a great, great introduction to boardgaming for him, and and great activity for us to do together.  His 5 yo brother also likes to help run one of my heroes, so this is wonderful quality time with both of them.  

I've rated SoM an 8 - this is specifically for playing with my kids.  It is a wonderful way to spend time with them.  If I were playing with adults, it probably drops to a 7 - I think I would still be willing to play, but I'd rather play something else.  The game does a good job of being an interesting experience, but after 5 plays I feel like there are not many interesting decisions - most decisions are driven by what cards you have, and they are relatively straightforward.  Sometimes, you must make a difficult choice.  In these cases, you are typically choosing blind between two options.  The benefit of your choice is then determined by what cards are subsequently drawn.  It is fairly unsatisfying from a thinky, puzzle-solving point of view.  In this respect it is not nearly as interesting as other co-ops such as Pandemic or Flash Point.  But as a story-telling mechanism it excels.  As a way of letting a child be a superhero with his Dad, it is a fantastic use of an afternoon.

Very good superhero card game, even without a licence. The replayability is insane because of all the deck combinations. It has a good balance between planning and the simplicity youÂ´d expect from a superhero game. The lifepoint tracking and the cumulating modifiers make it a little fiddly...I see how this might become a real issue for some players, but I donÂ´t mind. 
It can sometimes drag a little too long though....

Fantastic theme and some interesting ideas. I fear that there's too much stuff in the game which complicates the game. There's definitely a lot of text in the cards and reading through all of them is work.

RATING: 3
I like the theme of the game, and I like the fact that each player plays a specific hero, rather than a mix of heroes like in Marvel's Legendary card game.

BUT ... there's just WAY too much crap to remember and keep track of during play. It's too much of a hassle to play, because we have to keep checking every card every phase to make sure we don't forget something -- and we usually still end up forgetting something anyway. Too fiddly! Too much upkeep! I really WANT to like this game, but the maintenance during every phase is too annoying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game really really doesn't do it for me.  If there are interesting strategic decisions to make, I missed them - the best move always seemed pretty nearly dictated by the currently available cards.  Do the most damage possible or heal.  And despite this, the group I've played with wants to talk through every move endlessly.

Overall, the game is mechanically uninteresting and suffers massively from the typical downfalls of cooperative games.

I picked this up in a bulk trade, not expecting too much.  I had heard that it was clunky and slow.  I will agree it is kinda clunky and avoid analysis paralysis players if playing with more than 3.  That aside, I really liked the game.  It felt like a comic book.  It doesn't take too long to setup.  It will likely require expansions to keep it interesting but its a game I will keep.

 I like this game, I really do.  The mechanics are great.  Both the art and the theme do a fantastic job evoking superhero comics, which makes me happy.  It was one of the first truly cooperative games I ever played and did a great job bringing my son into gaming. My main issue with it is that it does get a little fiddly.  At some point during most games someone will turn to the other players and say something like "we forgot that no one should have drawn cards last turn" or "when did the immunity to  toxic damage wear off?

It feels like there's just too much going on sometimes.

I'm normally not at all a fan of games like this, where there are a bunch of cards with a bunch of text, all doing special powers that combo off from one another.  However, after giving this one a few plays, the chore of tracking all of this became much more second nature, and the fun of the game really shines through.

The replayability here is very high, as the various heroes work together in interesting and numerous ways, and the effectiveness of each hero against the various bad guys can vary a ton as well!  It's really interesting to see the match-ups, and how things play out from game to game.

Each hero, bad guy, and environment also has very different and well through out themes, making it really fun to experience each game.  Overall, just a fun game of good guys trying to beat down bad guys, with a ton of variability to keep it fresh game after game.

This is one of the best cooperative games I've played. Each hero deck has vastly different playstyles and strategies. The villains and environments add replay value and varied levels of difficulty. The components are fine; I lean towards games that incorporate stuff like boards, dice, and miniatures though, and this is just a card game (although the fact that I rated it a 7 based on gameplay alone means that I feel VERY highly about the gameplay). I cant stress enough how well the coop works; our group always makes sure to deliberate on which abilities we are going to use, which enemies to attack, and which overall strategy we'll use to win. The art is good (not great, a little amateurish but I have a soft spot for it because it looks a lot like the comics I used to draw in high school) and consistent. You can tell the creator spent a lot of time creating the different art for all the cards and that he really had a vision for the overall theme of the game.

The best cooperative I have ever come across.  The way it avoids the leader problem is great.  Most villains offer a nice level of tension.  I've had games where it looked like we were going win throughout but usually they have a time where it is clearly going to all go poorly - and then you can pull it out.  This adds a great feeling of accomplishment!

I read lots of comics. I'm constantly looking through the Eisner award winners for something to read (as a student, comics have become my go to for leisure reading).

Sentinels of the Multiverse plays like a comic, if comics were nothing but one long massive interminable fight. Each turn feels like a panel in a comic book if each panel showed every single punch kick laser blast whatever whether or not it had any impact whatsoever. And to win the fight, superheroes had to swing hundreds of punches.

Add to it, that many of the villains the heroes are facing, bring back threats you've already defeated, so that you can read the exact same panels you read five minutes ago all over again!

Heck, even when you are facing a new threat, you are reading the same comic panel all over again (a punch, a kick, a laser blast, whatever) except the target has changed.

I hereby give this game the award for game that least understands why comic books are successful as a medium.

This game also wins an award for first game to make me wish for player elimination. When you die, you do not get to leave the table of a game that might go on for another hour after you've died (recall, punch after painstaking punch, regardless of whether or not it has any impact). No, instead you have to stick around and use an ability each turn. And often that ability is just to let another player take an action. So you say, hey, does anyone want another action? Someone says yes, you say, ok go for it. And that's your turn. That's why they keep you at the table for another hour.

On the plus side, the game certainly passes on a sense of teamwork in that you feel like individuals moving towards a common goal as opposed to one hive mind doing all actions collectively. The biggest reason being, moves are usually really obvious, deal the most damage you can to the biggest threat unless someone else says they can handle it (in which case go after the second biggest threat). And the second biggest reason is that there is so much text, it is so small, that you have no idea what the capacities of the player across the table is. There is no way you could tell help them figure out what to do, so you just trust them to make the right call instead (of course, not having any idea what they are doing has me simply zoning out when it isn't my turn).

SotM is a neat and different coop. You are all fighting as superheroes against a super villain.  What is unique is that each player has his or her own deck of cards, so it feels different than many other coops. The alpha player syndrome is mitigated somewhat due to the fact that you control your own deck and make your own decisions based on that (though you obviously still need to talk about what to do). 
Speaking of the decks, there are a bunch of them, and they all feel different, at least those I tried. The villains are also very different!

I played it two times with rather experienced SotM players and one time with most of the players new to the game, but no matter what we won our games fairly convincingly. I want my coop games to be very hard so you lose most of the times and want to go back and try to do better, but SotM doesnât feel particularly hard which is a shame as it means that I probably wonât play it too often.

RATING: 7
Let's start with a rating of 7. I picked up SotM with the hope that I'd be able to play this solo as much as with a group. After one play solo and one with a group, I'm pretty pleased so far.

The game does an excellent job of conveying the feel of a superhero team against the big villain. It's a great marriage of theme and mechanics. Although I haven't played the various superhero deckbuilder games, I suspect I'd strongly prefer this setup, where each hero has their own deck. You identify more with your role and thematically it makes more sense.

There's certainly a fiddly element to the game, tracking damage buffs and other variables, but I'm guessing with familiarity that becomes easier. The Enhanced edition of the game is very attractive, and very functional, and you get the sense that a lot of tender loving care went into the publishing of this game.

Update: Eventually sold it off. It's just a bit too fiddly for my preference. I'd happily play it, but I don't need to own it.

RATING: 8
An awesome cooperative game that is modular enough to be different every time and offer whatever level of challenge the player is in the mood for. The theme of superheroes is also awesome, and the art and flavor texts do an excellent job of creating a new comic book multiverse. 
Occasionally the game may feel like it plays itself or that what you should do is obvious (happens more or less depending on the complexity of your hero). Also, some villains may be more annoying than challenging; it can be especially frustrating when a villain card manages to completely demolish your hero's set up by eliminating all ongoing or equipment cards, severely limiting what your hero can even do. 
Overall though, it's a great game! It may just require an occasional break if you've been bringing it out to the table a lot lately.

I thought it was going to be bitterly mathy. I was right. I didn't expect the theme to hit so hard, though. All those heroes are interesting and play very differently. Villains and environment effects make thematic sense. I usually do not care about theme, but it's hard to deny how well it's used here. An utter triumph.

Good fun.  My partner and I don't have many co-op games, so it is a breath of fresh air there.  Pretty quick game too (our other main co-op is Warhammer Quest which doesn't come out much because of the long play time), so will hopefully see a decent amount of play.

RATING: 8
Great game, simple but deep with some surprisingly complex card interactions. Tonnes of replayability even just in this base set, between the four (eight with hard mode) villains, ten heroes and four environments to fight in. Awesome fun, though can get fiddly for new players who aren't familiar with the characters. Once you get a feel for the heroes and their decks, along with the villain, I think the fiddliness subsides immensely.

I enjoyed the few games I was able to play, but not my favorite game ever.

Pros: 
--Seems like a wide variety of heroes and villains if you're looking for replayability.  Teaming up to beat down a villain was a fun experience for the 4 of us at the table, and I enjoyed Wraith's equipment-heavy style of play. 
-- Theme was fun, even if I'm not a big fan of the superhero genre.

Cons: 
-- Even with tokens to track the buffs and debuffs going around, it felt like most of my energy was spent maintaining the game state rather than strategizing.
-- Didn't feel the game scales appropriately as heroes are added and subtracted, some villain abilities damage all heroes, but the villain gets effectively less turns the more heroes you add to the game.

Played once with my 9-year-old son.  We had fun, but had a few rules questions.  I like the theme and mechanics, and can see us having fun with it.  The main thing I noticed was that it doesn't scale well.  We didn't really have a chance to win with 2 heroes.  I think next time, we'd need to play two each.  We have the first edition, so perhaps the rules have been tweaked in later versions.

RATING: 7.5
Solid Game, even though a little more playtesting would have been in order.  A few cards feel too overpowered and a few characters need a little bit more power.  However, the flavour of the game is awesome, the replayability is great and with expansions coming, it's going to be even better.  The game is more aimed at casual gamers and comic book readers than hardcore gamers.  Not the best game ever, but I always have fun playing, especially with my comic book friends.

In Soviet Russia, game plays you...hahaha. Seriously though - this game drags on more often than not, has really tedious bookkeeping and some frankly mystifying design choices (why are there about 50 million types of damage? So we can waste even more time checking to see if someone has a card out that actually reduces damage to one particular type? Oh yay).

Clearly, the word 'streamlining' did not enter the designers head when this game was made. Great theme, but that's about it really.

Based on the iOS version. Attractively packaged and competently executed but with far too low a ratio of interesting choices to minutes invested for my taste.

Great card coop. Very simple rules. The depth of this comes comes from the various card effects. Because of the high number of possible Heros/Villain/Environment-Combinations it has a very high replay value. Fantastic artwork and great component quality!  

Update: After a few plays the bookkeeping kills a good amount of the fun for me.

One of the most cinematic games I have played. Sentinels dominated our play time for several months. We played 2 consistent teams, which is how I think the game is intended. Each of us got to know our decks and their interactions with the other decks. Each had an established role on the team. We progressed through the villians, moving up in difficulty as we defeated them (though I think there are a couple at max difficulty villians we never managed to beat before we moved onto other games). I look back at it now as a superhero campaign we ran through.

I still pull out SotM for an occasional solo game. It's fiddly to run several heros by yourself but still great fun.  

Sentinels Legacy where you run through a campaign and deckbuild between fights sounds like superawesomeness.

Great card game: very flexible and its complexity can be adjusted to players' taste.

Pros

Sentinels has a simple mechanic that is easy to teach new players and is generally very fun to play.

the theme is fairly well done & the game has a lot of replayability.

the different characters give you a different experience each time you play it and many build up over time which is generally quite enjoyable.

there's a good amount of player interaction & cooperation and the alpha dog issue here seems less than a lot of other co-op games.

the game plays quickly enough and is fun along the way such that losing games are still quite fun.

Cons

there's a lot of variety in villains & heroes but there are also combinations that can easily lead to the game seeming quite unbalanced. I've played several sessions where we randomly hit on a very powerful hero combo and stomped the villain without any feeling of danger along the way. I've had the opposite happen as well. That said each game play isn't long enough that you mind too much and most sessions leave everyone involved feeling like they had a lot of fun.

support characters are very useful in the game but are less fun for most personalities to play as what you're doing is making others really powerful where you might feel like you're not doing too much. this isn't really a design problem necessarily but it's something to be aware of.

as simple as the rules are it's very easy to forget about one of a villain or henchman's abilities as lots of abilities modify other abilities.

I am very disapointed with this game. I was originally exited about a coop card game with superhero theme but the gameplay is dull with very few drawing and card play and the combos are limited. You pretty much end with a brainless gameplay and this is not what I like of a card game.

A card game, but not the type you're probably used to: it's neither a Magic nor a Dominion. Each superhero is represented by a deck which has a different strategy, and you work together to fight against a boss and the environment. This sounds great (actually it is pretty great) but you quickly realize that each hero can only do a small selection of things. If you're the Flash, would you like to run around and do a little damage to everyone...or run around faster and do a little less damage to a few more people? That's the sort of thing you're going to notice pretty quickly. Their version of the Flash does small but area damage, their Batman takes out single big guys, ect. That's not bad, and there's a fair amount of replay if you get the expansions, but once you beat each villain once or twice you probably won't feel the need to play it anymore. If you're looking for more meat, the Marvel Legendary game supposedly surpasses Sentinels in most ways.

Omnicron is not an easy Boss.

Game is hard. Victory was glorious. Some setups however, seem impossible - which shouldn't be the case.

After playing Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game, which was pretty lame game I was told that Sentinels of the Multiverse is much better. So I waited anxiously for the opportunity to try that game.

What a dissapointment. Oh boy, that game was so dull that after an hour of mindless flutter I started to engineer the way to get out of the game by killing my so called superhero. For now I know that this won't work. Fortunately one of us run out of time and had to leave, so we just quit the game. An hour and half wasted.

So what is wrong with that game? Well, at first it is a full co-op and I don't like co-operative games. Although, there are few that are good, like Robinson Crusoe and Mice & Mystics. Secondly, Sentines of the Multiverse is a card game and I don't like those too. Again, there are exceptions like Innovation, but in general I prefer games with miniatures and board and dice etc.

But putting aside my personal preferences, the game was still bad. There was a lot of down-time - in order to wait my turn to play a lousy card and use my power I had to wait like 5 minutes or so! And the theme... well, what theme? Artwork is uninteresting, the heroes medicore and story non-existent. The co-op play and player interaction were also minimal. Well, maybe it was so annoying because of five player game and unthematic behavior (just "I play this and do 1 damage" instead of saying "I will hit the villain with my mighty thunderbolt bla bla bla". Maybe. I don't want to waste another two hours to find out. Instead of that I'll play Marvel Heroes if I want to play really good and thematic superhero game.

I love the concept of this game; co-op play with customized decks for each hero, villain and environment. There's a lot of replay value in this box. My only gripe so far is that it feels like, depending on the hero-villain-environment combo, the game balance swings from insanely difficult to ridiculously easy. But I'm only a few plays in so hopefully this will prove not to be the case.

With the right people, this game is a blast. There is a lot of text, but once you get a hang of the characters and how the characters interact with each other, the villain, and the environment, it's great to explore the various combos among your superhero team.

It may benefit from slimming down the text into icons, but some characters would suffer. At times, there is a lot going on and it's easy to forget certain cards' effects, but that often adds to the chaotic feel of the battle, increasing the tension and hopelessness.

This game is so tough to rate. I LOVE this game. play it on iOS all of the time, but have trouble wanting to pull it to the table.

So much mathy modification keeps it from getting into the 9+, but this is the superhero game for me so all of the great heroes, villains and locals (along now with the app) keeps it from sinking into the 7.something range!

Great theme, components and gameplay, the superhero vibe really comes thorugh. Once you've learned the heroes and villains you can pull some clever plays, though upkeep can become a chore with some of the more card-intensive villains. Seems to suffer from alpha-player-syndrome with new players as many cooperative titles do. The base game tends to become too easy with more players, so I'd recommend the "advanced" villian-powers once everyone knows what they're doing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Look, I know the game is fiddly.  Well man/woman up and deal with it!  With Great Power comes Great Fiddliness!  And the fiddliness can absolutely be mitigated by buying an additional $5 app.  And the lack of variety in the base box can be mitigated by buying one or two $20 expansions.  So what?  They're like gadgets, and you're like Batman, and you gotta catch them all...

Alright, Sentinels takes a bit work to love.  Until you learn the heroes and villains and environments, you're going to have some terrible games.  But!  If you like learning how decks work and solving the puzzle of how to balance a hero team against a villain, it's quite a hoot!  Just crank some 80's tunes and think of the first few games as a training montage and eventually, after dropping many eggs, you'll successfully carry it in a spoon across the finish line with a freeze frame high five accompanying the final power chord.

I also recommend playing two players with two heroes each.  Double fisting heroes makes it more fun!

I'm really glad we played this before Legendary, because I suspect my opinion would have been much more negative if it had been the other way around.

There are certainly similarities - a cooperative game of superheroes trying to outwit an evil mastermind. Other annoying threats cropping up to distract you. Hoping you can stack powers on top of each other to maximize your attacks.

In general this felt too hard, though - but we've since been told that 2-player that's common, so I'll call this rating preliminary and hope to try it again with either more players, or each of us playing two characters.

I can't explain clearly why I didn't like it, but I didn't like it. So much to keep track of.

I just hate it when my fights look like this: Ok, so... let me read this card... and this one... oh wait maybe this new skill I haven't read yet. Ok I'll attack with this one, let me read it to you... blah blah blah... ok so I have this other card that adds 2 damage to it... oh and let's not forget this superpower I have that could make it more powerful... but the vilain has a device that makes it immune and this power that reflects it to another target.... How much HP did you have left again? Hold on, let me call my accountant.

Pre-built deck for fast and pure fun play. Better than LotR LCG to play in-person because this one feels personality in each hero (and no need to deck build). Perhaps better than PACG for the same reason. Problem: many conditions to keep track of and not for 2p; fun level depends on the players digging the super hero genre. Might purchase again when the kids grow older and get into super hero genre.

RATING: 5
This game can be really fun, and has a lot of good things about it: the rules are simple enough for lighter gamers to quickly dive in; each hero deck has a notably different feel to it; the theme's exciting and well-done; the number of different heroes / villains / environments is excellent for a base game. And while it's not exactly a deeply strategic game, when you've got a good matchup, the decisions feel meaningful and the tradeoffs can be nail-biting.

But... making that good matchup is the tricky bit. There is *very* little guidance about what makes a good game, and the claim that 3 or 5 both play about the same as 4 is something of an exaggeration. Even an immensely oversimplified system (eg: "Each hero can handle roughly 10 Difficulty. [Villain X] = 30 Difficulty, +5-10 if the heroes have no "damage all enemies".) would be better than nothing. Matchups which are too easy are really dull; games which are too hard are more interesting, but can be frustrating if they're too much too hard.

(I've heard that the Rook City expansion has some villains which scale better to the number of players, which appeals.)

An unfortunate, clumsy first experience.  I like CDGs, but this one had trouble pulling it off with the whole HP and paper tracking mechanic.  It could have been that the villain that we fought, the Omnitron, is not well designed leading to the lackluster experience.  I'd play it again as long as there was a different villain before I totally write this one off.

While this is a great game, there are an awful lot of bits to use and (at times) a ton of upkeep and interactions that the player much sort through turn after turn. Beyond that, still a really solid game experience.

RATING: 5
For Co-op game, this is not bad. But for a game itself, it suffers from wild swings of luck. From the mechanic on the rulebook it seems there's a lot of room for clever plays. Unfortunately during the game, it actually doesn't matter that much. Yes, you can do stupid things, that's definitely path to failure. But you can do average thing and still win, or you can do your best thinking and still lose.

Components: Great realization of the theme. The artwork is simplistic, but hits all the right notes with the action shots and the names of cards. I also like that the cards sometimes feature other heroes in them.

Coming with ten heroes, four villains, and four environments allows for great replayability right out of the box. Every game with playable characters should come with this much content.

The graphic design of the cards, however, is quite poor. The font is cartoonish and small; too small to read unless right in front of me. Important information is buried in long sentences.

The rules leave a LOT to be desired. Again, important information is buried in unlabeled paragraphs. Character bios are sprinkled throughout when they would have been better served pushed to the back (like the building bios in Blue Moon City). We've had constant questions about basic rules of the game, specific card powers, timing, card interactions, etc. There are already 200+ threads in the rules forum here on the Geek, which is too many to sift through for a game that isn't delivering enough from the get go.

Experience: With 2 players, this game just doesn't work. We've been stomped by Baron Blade and by Citizen Dawn, and both times it seemed impossible that we could have won. The advanced rules mention playing with two heroes per player (with 2 players), but there are already so many cards to keep track of, I'm not thrilled at the idea of having even more information to track. This game doesn't seem smart enough to scale to the number of players (more players = easier).

A quick rant about cooperatives: the more information a cooperative game layers on the âvillainâ side, the more likely the players will forget this information. As in other games, each player scrutinizes their own information, and interprets rules to their advantage, and always remembers to use their own powers. But there's noone giving such scrutiny to the opposition, and we have little incentive (even if not consciously) to remember to enact each villainous action. In this recent game of Sentinels of the Multiverse, Citizen Dawn had 10+ villain cards out at once, and we had to march through them all each round, applying each of their effects when appropriate. Felt like work.

Very nice co-operative card game. As a comic book reader and collector for almost my entire life, I'm a sucker for the theme. I really appreciate how each hero, villain, and environment plays differently and thematically. Although many people seem to love the artwork, I find it somewhat amateurish (sorry) compared to modern comic book artwork. I appreciate that Greater Than Games came up with their own comic book characters and mythology, but I wish I was playing with familiar DC Comics characters instead.

Some combinations of heroes and villains and locations just don't play well together, unfortunately, and those setups should be avoided. Learning what those bad combinations are, however, is a process of trial and error.

I have found that the gameplay gets boring with repeated plays. It's really about the narrative. You need to use your imagination to make the gameplay interesting. It's also very fiddly with the constant upkeep of hit points and damage buffs and debuffs. I find that aspect of the game draining and not fun. The few combos that each hero has are slow to materialize as you are typically only playing 1 card and drawing 1 card each turn. It's like playing in slow motion. There's also often little choice in what you should do.

I recently purchased the iOS app to play on my iPad. It's superior to the physical game in that you don't have to keep track of hit points and any damage buffs/debuffs. That speeds up the gameplay considerably and makes it far more enjoyable.

Maybe I'm biased because the first game I played against the Matriarch and Anubis, but this game involves a lot of calculating minutiae like: deal X damage to the non-environmental target with the 2nd-highest HP; also deal Y + Z damage to the non-hero target with the 2nd lowest HP; etc.  There is often an optimum card play out there, but you have to do mental arithmetic to find it.

And that's the biggest problem: most decisions are not all that interesting and you have all the downtime in the world to maximize.

In its favor, it's very simple to teach.

Lovely thematic game. Cards are great and with a little commentary and chat you can create a comic book atmosphere and storyline as the game plays out. Our first game was a little easy against Baron Blade but it shows great potential. I described it to the kids as a bit like a cross between a fighting video game with HP (Mortal Kombat etc) and fluxx with all the cards on the table making up different rules and stuff happen. They got that analogy and were more on the ball with it than I was!

My favorite superheroes game. The artwork appeals to me, although clearly it's not as good as mainstream comic book art...it has an appeal because it's not mainstream.

The battles are tough and there are many heroes and villains from which to choose. Each hero and villain comes with their own deck, and the environment decks add another twist.

All in all, a very fun time.

Sentinels of the Multiverse is a card driven cooperative game that is rich in theme and easy to play. This game provides boatloads of replayability and is very easy to take out and play. The concept of 1 villain deck + 1 environment deck + 3-5 hero decks is extremely modular, easy to expand and creates rich, different scenarios each game. The difficulty of this game is a big swingy but I think it actually adds to the theme because you can never know just how dangerous the supervillain will be at any given time. Overall I find Sentinels of the Multiverse to be a really fun thematic experience. It is not only one of my favorite solo games but also my favorite cooperative game of all time.

I am not sure if it was my hero or what, but it felt like I wasn't doing anything for the whole game. Also, it felt that it started pretty slow, and by the time I felt like I was actually getting somewhere, the game was over. I also found that trying to figure out when everything activated and what not was too much of a chore.

Wouldn't mind giving it another try.

Edit: I thought my wife might enjoy the game since she likes coops and she likes killing stuff. Wow, she really liked, we have been playing several times a week for the last few weeks and even when we get destroyed she has a lots of fun.

The game is definitely better with less players specially if you are starting out since there is so much to keep track of. Using dice for HP helps a lot.

The two player variant in the forums works wonders for people that don't want to play multiple heroes. It definitely went up in ranking!

It's possible for certain combinations of villains and heroes and places to simply not work, and the keeping track of everything can get overwhelming, but when it works (like it does most of the time) it's a lot of fun. I've bought most of the things available for this, but small cards and sets aren't showing in my collection. I much prefer this to Legendary due to actually playing a role and each character being so different. The app is essential for keeping track of things.

Sentinels is technically the best superhero game out there. I prefer Marvel Legendary, just because of the theme.

A game that succeeds in spite of itself. It is way too fiddly (although the sidekick app helps with that) and the design is sloppy with lots of rough edges.

But I keep thinking how this could have been an absolutely amazing game with a bit more development and refinement. But it's still very good even with the obvious problems.

Have finally played, and am a bit concerned that each character has a set way to play it.  With several environments and villains, as well as combinations of heroes, you'd think this would lead to a different game each time.  And maybe it will.  But I'm more concerned that if I play X character then I'm committed to Y strategy.  I would have liked fewer characters that were more flexible.  Also, the rules could really use an FAQ.

One of the best coops around. This is easy to teach (just one (1) page of rules needed), quick to play and yet, there's lots of tactics involved. Part of the fun in this game stems from getting to know the different hero, villain and environment decks, which seem to be finely balanced (well, and of course from finding that massive damage combo ;) )

Strictly speaking, this doesn't belong here, but talking about balancing: some of the promos seems to be way imbalanced (thinking of Tachyon there), on the other hand, that makes adapting the difficulty setting to "very easy" nice and simple.

Creates an excellent narrative just about every time you play. Can get bogged down slightly with upkeep but the game is just too much fun to pass up. The Heroes and Villains feel very tangible and real, and all of them play uniquely. I like the art too! 

I mostly play solo with a 3 Hero team although my wife joins me for a game occasionally.

I use the following houserules:
Ambuscade: Trap cards activate as they come up in the Villain deck, and are then reshuffled back into the deck.
Chokepoint: On her flipped side, increase damage dealt and reduce damage taken by X, where X is the number of cards face-down in the villain play area from that particular deck.
Spite: Does not heal on damage, just destroying victims.

I'm not sure why this one fell so flat with me.  I think it was because I felt out of touch with what was going on.  It took a long time to play and I had virtually no real decisions to make.  It was also very loud in the room and I couldn't hear the person talking about the "bad" events and abilities.  And there were a lot of cards and abilities he was reading.  Very confusing what they all were.  We might have played too complex a scenario as well.  I was looking forward to either winning or losing..I didn't care which.

I enjoy being a super hero, and this does a great job of letting me play one. You know. Just with cards.

I love cooperative games, and Sentinels is the best of the non-realtime ones (because trying to compare this to Space Alert is unfair to both games).  The game is all about narrative: the struggle to take down the Big Bad before all is lost.  Even without the expansions (and trust me, once you get hooked you WILL want all the expansions), there is so much replay value right out of the box that it will take many many plays before anything will start to seem like old hat.  The mechanics are simple, but the strategies as a team are really the key to this game... as such, I know of no other cooperative game (again, not counting Space Alert) that works so hard to create such variability and yet promote teamwork more.  An excellent design.

A brief and simple co-op game. The game represents heroes, supervillains, and the battle site with decks of cards. So you will power-up and play attacks all from your individual deck.

The game is a pretty straightforward slugfest, where you boost up your guys, bash on the minions, and whittle down the villain hit points.

My gripes are that game lacks real narrative, and also needs more interesting interaction or mechanism.

This game captures its theme better than any other superhero game I have played.  The art fills me with joy.  Every hero and villain has his/her own distinct feel, conveyed not just by flavor text, but by the mechanisms of their individual decks.  The downside is that despite the rather simple rules framework, there is a LOT to keep track of.

The app version of the game is also wonderful.

The bad news is that my plays of the app have convinced me of two things:
1) I will never get anyone to play this with me
2) Even if I did, there is pretty much no chance I will play the game correctly.

Consequently, I think I will rely upon the app for my Sentinels fix, and pass on my cards to someone with a brain big enough to keep track of the game state.  The Sidekick app is helpful, but is also an admission of sorts that there is just way too much bookkeeping in this game.  I would love it if GtG eventually comes out with a revised edition that keeps the interesting aspects but streamlines the need for information tracking and the reduces the complications of applying effects.

It's got a lot of confusing bookkeeping, it gets messed up by squirrelly card draws, and the complexity will throw you. But it has theme in spades, and the moments where a single random card destroys your whole party just feels RIGHT.

RATING: 7
The theme is really strong in this game. When I can get into the headspace of heroism the game feels good. When not, it feels like slowly playing out the elements of your chosen deck. The mix-and-match nature of the game means sometimes you barely get to play. Each hero has a number of plays before the whole deck clicks into place and practically plays itself. Before then the game is fun. After that, it becomes something of a chore.

So glad I bought this. Actually feels like your on a team of superheros as you and your teammates coordinate your powers to defeat the super villain. Could use some kind of balancing mechanic, but all in all a great game.

Just an absolute blast. This game embodies everything that that their is to a super hero world. Fantastic art work, with a variety of colorful characters and villains to choose from. The game itself is simple to learn, but that doesn't mean it's easy to beat. If you're into super hero, or just fun card/ deck games, then this is for you.

Played over holiday 2017 with two sons, handling multiple characters (which is pretty easy to do) to total five heroes on the team. Amazing experience! We played three times in a row. The power cards offer great variety, each hero is unique and well-balanced, there's a ton of strategy involved in learning how to best use the less "straightforward" heroes (e.g. Absolute Zero, The Fanatic). We had a blast reading the card flavor text on each turn. This game was obviously made with a lot of love and care, by an indie design team. Already thinking about snagging the Rook City/Infernal Relics expansion. Highly recommended if you want a completely card-driven, tactical superhero beat-em-up.

First, the artwork in this game is outstanding.  They perfectly captured the look and feel of comic book heros and villans.   It's weird that the Environments are text only, however.   There are some pretty sloppy design elements:  ambiguous text and powers, no scaling for number of players, balance issues, and highly variable degrees of difficulty.   All of these things can be managed up front by experienced players, but you'd think the design could have been polished up a bit more.   There are a lot of +1s and -1s to deal with, but it isn't hard.   Gameplay is quite simple, too:  play a card, choose and use a power.   Try to defeat the villain (not a player) before you die.   But, despite all that, the art and setting make it still work.   Casual and quick, don't look for anything beyond that.

This is a cooperative quasi-role-playing game set in the superhero genre.  With tons of expansions creating a vast assortment of characters and scenarios to choose from, it successfully sets out to do what it aims for.  But for me, its not really a game but more of an activity.  Once asked to describe it, I called it âan activity for adolescent Junior High School kids with no sense yet of their own mortality stuck inside on a rainy day during their summer vacation.â  I would have probably loved Sentinels of the Multiverse back in 5th or 6th Grade.  However, as a âgameâ you really are just sitting back, playing your character, and dealing out your action cards to either attack a foe or heal a team member; little or no strategy as to what you are going to do to change the outcome of what cards the foe randomly draws.  
Regarding the artwork, Iâm not sure if the publishers were intentionally going for an abstract look here to allow players to use their imagination during play, or were just pumping out cards on the cheap.  I honestly canât tell exactly what Iâm looking at on the cards sometime.  
Great for kids (on a rainy day during their summer vacation with no sense yet of their own mortality).

Wow, this is just a darn good game with very few flaws.  I enjoy playing it more than Legendary, which WAS my favorite card game until I bought this.  The only one thing that Legendary has that Sentinels is missing, is the scheme cards.  Each time you fight a villain in Sentinels, they have the same deck and the same conditions for victory.  In Legendary, you have a villain AND a scheme, which adds more variety and playability.  Hopefully, this is something they may consider in future expansions.  The heros and villains are all pretty cool and mostly balanced, and even though this is game is unlicensed (another thing that favors Legendary), it really doesn't take much imagination to figure out what Sentinel corresponds to what Marvel/DC superhero(s).  The only small complaint I have is when you first start playing it, it has a very steep learning curve, much like Dominion.  You are going to be overwhelmed with all the complex text on the cards and keeping track of all the ongoing powers and such.  Basically, expect to screw up a lot, and expect to be beaten by the bad guys alot as well.  Each villain card has an advanced mode that makes them harder (which you probably won't be using in your first 25 play throughs), but I almost wish they would have included a novice mode, for younger and inexperienced gamers to get a feel for the game without completely being decimated.  Of course, everyone is free to house rule those, but the BIG caveat to house ruling Sentinels is that the game has a very delicate balance, one that you can really screw up if you start changing the rules.

RATING: 7.5
This is a cooperative card-based game in which players choose from a multitude of Heroes and battle a chosen Villain in an Environment.  Each Hero, Villain, and Environment have their own individual card decks, so this is not a drafting or deck-building game.  

Every Hero's own decks are nicely designed, leading them to play quite differently.  The same goes for the Villains and Environments.  You can tell that a lot went into the designs for each deck, as each card has it's own graphic and flavor text.  

Common complaints with the game include the bookkeeping that is necessary and some ambiguity with rules.  There is a good amount of reading to do on each card and you also need to keep track of the different effects that are chained together.  This is definitely fiddly and a hassle, which leads to almost no mistake-free games.    

That being said, this game is still fun and engaging.  The individualized card decks give players the feeling that they are playing a unique superhero, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, depending on the Villain they're up against.  I also really enjoy the different Environments as they can not only hurt the players, but can actually be very beneficial if managed/manipulated correctly.  

The amount of Hero, Villain, and Environment decks available, coupled with all of the expansions available, ensure that no 2 games will play the same!  Recommended!

Sentinels of the Multiverse is a card game co-op with comic book/super hero theme. Upon playing it, I immediately got a video game vibe from it. First of all, you have a team of characters that are fighting a boss which will usually spawn lesser enemies and can have devastating special attacks. In addition, there are many damage types (fire, lightning, energy, melee, projectile, etc.) in the game which can be boosted, reduced, redirected and rendered useless through immunity. One of the 'bosses' has the video game boss cliche of when it's dealt a type of damage it becomes immune to that type, so you have to keep switching damage types against it. To me, it almost felt like an MMO in card format where you have a team which will try to take down a boss and each team member serves a role, be it control, dps, healing, and tank. There are other games which have tried to mimic such a thing such as WoW: TCG with raid decks and there are Magic: The Gathering sets which also had one player as a boss and others playing the heroes, trying to beat the boss. I never played these specific modules, but I do know about each of these games and they didn't mimic the MMO feel the way Sentinels does.

One of the great things about this card game co-op over the previously mentioned CCGs and even the LotR LCG is that this is a much cheaper option. Sentinels does have expansions, but they aren't released monthly and you know what you're getting when you buy it because all expansions are the same so it doesn't feel like a financial burden. In addition, I feel you get a lot for your money. Consider Yomi's complete set and 16 factions for Summoner Wars... both would cost you $100+ and only give you about the same amount of cards as Sentinels of the Multiverse which costs about $35 - $40 and the prices for the original Sentinels is probably a bit cheaper than the Enhanced Edition. I would even consider the replay value of Sentinels to be comparable with Summoner Wars (16 factions) and Yomi Complete Edition as Sentinels comes with 10 Heroes, 4 Villains, and 4 Environments. You use 3 - 5 Heroes, 1 Villain and 1 Environment per game. That's a lot of configurations and really a stunning value for your money.

The Enhanced Edition add tokens to remind players of various status effects, damage tokens which was sorely needed, and a bigger box to put everything.  Beyond that, the rulebook is better and the added artwork to all of the environment cards which makes the game feel a bit more consistent. I can't help but mention the oversized villain cards. They aren't included in the box but were introduced with the a Enhanced Edition as a kickstarter stretch goal but is also available as a separate purchase. These are a great edition and should just be included in the game as the oversized cards make the bosses seem more menacing. It's definitely the definitive version of the game you want to buy and upgrade to if you are the owner of the original edition. 

That said, this game does have some negative aspects: the game is very text heavy and you will need to re-read cards often (mostly the villain cards).  Beyond that, you will be moving around a lot of hp tokens and tracking tokens that I mentioned earlier.  Finally, a lot of villain and environments will attack people based on their HP, so, you're constantly having to figure out who has the highest or lowest or second highest and second lowest.  So, if you really can't stand bookkeeping this game may bother you.  Even digitally, this game just isn't as fun as I found it to be the first time. If you do like this sort of game, it's a great value. This game is not for me though.

Aeon's End fires this game, in my opinion.

If you like comic books or even just movies about super heroes, b-u-y... t-h-i-s. It's good. The balance can get a bit out of whack on some games, and the bookkeeping can be annoying. 2nd edition might fix some of that.

For me and my group, this game does NOT play well with two players. First off, if you each only play with one hero (for a total of two) even the easiest bosses are just about impossible to beat. If you each play with two heroes (for a total of four) then you have a competitive but not guaranteed chance to win, which is great and fun, but then you have to split your attention between your two heroes, the environment deck, and the villain deck. I don't even bother to play with just two players anymore. With more players, though, it's a great game with a fun theme!

There are very few games that make me want to replay them just as soon as I finish one playthrough. Sentinels of the Multiverse Enhanced Edition is one of those games I could pick up and play over and over and OVER AGAIN!  The theme is simple, you are a part of a team of superheroes and there is a villain rampaging through the streets, base, city, etc and it is your job to stop them.  This game while 2-5 players really can be soloed easily as you just have to play the role of the other players, but becomes more fun when you and a group of friends breathe a sigh of relief when you finally take down the villain.  There are also environment cards which affect your choices and plays for better and mostly worse.  With 10 heroes, 4 villains, and 4 environments in the base game, you are hard-pressed not to pick this one up as inexpensive as it is!

Superhero co-op card game. Great idea! 

But the execution ... poor. I think if you're someone who likes just playing cards for "cool effects", that's fine but otherwise, the game has no narrative. It's got the "what" and "how" but the "why" is sadly lacking. This lack of a narrative also means it falls down badly as a co-op. Co-ops should be about interaction, i.e., players actually working together and cooperating. Just saying all the players are against some AI with no thought as to how the players can work together does not make a co-op game.

Usability - also poor. Gameplay involves various cards on the table. All these cards interact one way or the other. So you've got to read the card text, which is tiny, on all these cards laid out on the table. Just painful.

RATING: 6.5
Loved the game, cool characters fun, but simple mechanics, some interesting choices and interaction. but two things constantly annoyed me enough that I got rid of it: 1- since there is no turn order, discussing every bodies abilities and what to do next slowed the game way down!  And made me feel like I was trudging through Jurassic swamp rather than soaring over it. This could be mitigated by a player turn order that his house ruled, but then a key element of the games strategy is lost.  The other thing is those stupid markers to track damage and abilities.  I wish when I owned it they had made the app.  That is a must to download!

In evaluating this game, there are three versions you have to consider: 1) the board version without the phone app, 2) the board version with the phone app, and 3) the PC/iOS version. I play the PC version (Steam) and enjoy it as a diversion. I can tell from my experience on Steam that I wouldnât want to invest in the physical copy and play the game that way for the reason that this game is more aptly titled, âModified Modifiers: the Card Game.â 

What I mean is, the game is one of dealing and receiving damage that is usually modified by other effects in play, and keeping track of all those sounds like it would seriously detract from my enjoyment of the game. The PC version handles all that so I can just focus on playing my cards. The phone app supposedly helps in this regard, and maybe it does, but Iâm nowhere near motivated to find out when I have the convenience of the PC version to enjoy. 
 
So, thatâs my preference for how I play the game; now I can comment on the game play itself.  I enjoy the game for what it is â choosing different hero decks that complement each other and creating effective card combos. Choosing the different hero decks is no small matter here. Whereas in LOTR TCG you build your deck, here you build your team by choosing a prebuilt hero deck. Some characters are better at dealing damage, others at healing, and others at removing annoying ongoing effects. You need to consider both the villain youâre playing and the environment.

In a clever (albeit often annoying twist), you have to deal with both the villain youâre fighting as well as the physical locale where the battle is taking place. You might be in dinosaur land or a metropolis. The environment lashes out at both heroes and villains (though mostly heroes), so youâre often fighting a two-fronted war. The villains all have a special ability like flipping to a different side or mid-game healing or pulling things out of their discard, etc. 

The fun point of the game, then, is choosing the right hero combination then playing cards effectively. Each hero has a distinct way of playing that you need to learn in order to set them up for an effective combo tableau. Sometimes I just set up a game, go in and get wiped out because I donât know what to expect or I donât know the heroes Iâm using, so I reset with a different team and approach. In this regard, itâs similar to playing an adventure in LOTR TCG where you then tweak your deck. For people that donât like to deckbuild with individual cards, here you look at the different hero decks and choose.

The downside of the game is that itâs often âAttrition: the Card Gameâ and you play round after round of basically the same thing as you whittle the villain down from dozens or hundreds of hit points until theyâre dead. There are some combinations that are either impossible or unlikely to win, and it can be frustrating.

I don't really like comics or superheroes.

However, this game was genuinely fun to play with others.  There are enough expansion and add-ons that you can play a different game each time.  The superheros have distinct personalities, and are not typically horribly-objectifying.

Solid game with a great theme.  Not my type of game, but if you're into coops and cards then check it out.

Super Thematic. Incredibly varied each play (even with the same set up).  Loads of fun.  There can be a lot to keep track of, and there are LOTS of ways for the characters to interact, but it's worth the brain burn for what you get out of it.  I love this game.

RATING: 6
This game works well enough, but it seems to me that the attraction must be based on a sense of immersion and theme, and of imminent danger.  I didn't feel any of these as we played (perhaps because we dispatched the bad guy fairly easily.)  For this reason, I'd be willing to play again if a group wanted to play, but I don't feel much of a desire to encourage others to play the game with me.

ok co-op game, generic super heroes hadn't been done at the time but now it's an overdone theme.  Gameplay was ok.  Mostly a 'take that' style card game.  AI settings for bad guys were pretty well balanced for the 1 play - seemed like difficulty was good for building suspenseful gameplay.

I have an absolute blast playing this game.  It tends to go over very well with Magic players as the gameplay is apparently similar.  With all the heroes, villains, and environments (and promos), the replayability is through the roof and that's not even counting that each villain has an advanced mode or the story challenges you can print off from their website.  Even cooler is that the characters they have made up really exist and there is a friendly rabid fan-base that loves the comic book back story as well as the game itself. Sometimes a combination of the villain/environment/bad shuffles can limit what your hero does, but I've yet to find a hero that I just really don't care too much for (except maybe Bunker).

OMFG, what an annoying game. Seems fairly obvious what to play each turn and having to pore over endless text on all the cards is just tedious and unamusing. And then there's the tedium of monitoring all the card interactions. Feh!

The thematic nature of it all may appeal to someone really into comic books and such, but this really seems like a game designed for kids.

I am an unabashed fanboy for this game.  I have played it dozens of times, and I still find each play fresh and fun.

[u]The Good[/u]: 1) Captures the essence of a group of Superheroes facing off against a mastermind Villain. 2) Huge amounts of replayability combined with the fact that it can be played solo. 3) Tons of high quality fan-made content that expands the game even further.

[u]The Bad[/u]: Laden with heaps of math and book keeping. The 2nd Edition of the game comes with a set of counters, which helps, but still doesn't cover all bases, leaving the players to come up with their own system to keep track of everything - and there is a lot, lot, lot of stuff to keep track of.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: If you enjoy the classic comic book clashes between Superhero and Supervillain, and you don't mind a bit (ton) of book keeping, this game will deliver big.

Very simple play a card draw a card system with a supehero theme.

Unfortunately has been ruined a bit by an overzealous player telling me EXACTLY what the superhero deck I picked is going to do, 

ME: I play X card which is kinda cool, 
OTHER PLAYER: Well there are three other copies of X in your deck and when you combine them with Y and Z then you can do stupid damage.

*sigh*

Sentinels is my all time favorite game. There is an immersive world to go along with it and I'm such a sucker for superheroes. I love the theme of working together as heroes against a villain and I think SoTM takes that theme and just does it completely right in the best of ways.

RATING: 9
Awesomely fun, currently my favorite cooperative game.  Unlikely to get boring anytime soon because there so many different heroes and combinations of heroes/villain/environment to play.  I definitely recommend starting with heroes labeled with low or medium complexity for the  first several plays.  However, so far, killing the villains has generally been too easy, so you might want to progress to higher levels of villain difficulty after the first or second play.

RATING: 8.5
While I've never been a big comic book reader, I certainly do appreciate the genre and its tropes. And of course, who hasn't fantasized about being a superhero at one time or another? Luckily, Sentinels of the Multiverse does a great job of making the player feel like a superhero in an action-packed comic book.

Sentinels of the Multiverse makes great use of its card-driven mechanics. Each hero in the game has his/her own (fixed) deck, and they all operate slightly differently from each other, allowing for a variety of gameplay styles. The villain and environment decks make sure each game is different, even when using the same decks. What's amazing is so much variety is possible even though everything follows the same, basic, easy-to-follow set of rules. The downside, which is shared with many other card-driven games, is that the rule interactions do occasionally get complicated and ambiguous. Furthermore, it can sometimes be difficult to keep track of all the ongoing effects in play, although there are markers to somewhat alleviate that. Another consequence of using decks to drive the gameplay is that luck can play a huge role in determining whether games become too easy or too hard. That said, Sentinels of the Multiverse plays so smoothly using its mechanics that I would almost always be willing to put up with the drawbacks to save the world once again.

Draw, read the card, and play. Not enough strategy for me. Very much like Red Dragon Inn but lacking some of the humor (although, unlike my friends, I don't think it's funny--but I do think it is clever).  Mostly I find it annoying, like this card game.

I never liked comics as a kid and I intensely dislike the similar graphics.

Pros
-Superhero theme, cooperative game
-Has mashup of different bosses and locations
-Decent number of heroes, they play somewhat differently but limited by the game mechanics (see cons below)
-Fairly easy to teach
-Flavor text is nice, rulebook is comic book format/fun, art is good quality (personally not a huge fan of the style but I can acknowledge its competently done at least).

Cons
-Very one dimensional. Everything in the game focuses on damage. If the ability doesn't do damage, it gives +damage to another effect or gives you -damage for a turn.
-Scales fairly poorly with number of players (only some abilities refer to number of players)
-Very little decision making. Each turn, draw one card, play one card and activate one ability. The choices typically are obvious (I play my turn in about 2-4 seconds)
-One card a turn no combo potential
-Different attack elements for the sake of just having different types (and there is a lot of them), they don't have any inherent differences.
-The heroes mostly play the same way

I used to play the World of Warcraft trading card game, and one of the fun things you could do in it is play a cooperative raid dungeon.  Sentinels is the distilled essence of those, without the baggage of trying to adapt a regular trading card game to fit.  The custom decks are unique and provide a lot of replay value.  I prefer shorter games, but this is one I can make an exception for, on occasion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sentinels of the Multiverse makes me feel like a super hero. The theme just oozes out of this game. It really works for me.

Unfortunately, the game suffers from being a bit too mathy and fiddly. The way the various heroes, villains and environments all interact is a huge selling point and helps keep the game interesting, but it can quickly become difficult to track everything. My group almost always gets something wrong.

Fortunately, there's a digital version of the game found on Steam that handles all the fiddliness for you. It doesn't have the full collection of heroes, villains and environments available yet, but it drastically speeds up the game while keeping track of all the details, making it my preferred way of playing the game.

My recommendation is to pick up a copy (or two, to play with a friend) of the digital version first to determine if this is a game you're interested in learning. If you love it (and really want the tactile feel of playing the physical version), then pick up the original and its many expansions.

This game is a BLAST! I picked it up at the NYC Comic Con this past weekend. I got it with the promo "Legacy" card which puts on nice twist on the standard Legacy that comes with the game.  I have played it 3 times since I got home 5 days ago.  Each hero plays very differently and has a unique feel.  The artwork is excellent and every card has some sort of fluff text to add to the atmosphere of the game.  I have played against 3 of the 4 villains and each requires their own strategies to win against.  A hero might have a power or card that seems somewhat useless against one villain, only to discover it is amazing vs another.  I do suggest keeping a pile of D6s or even better D10s handy for tracking the health of minions and such.  Either that or just use a piece of paper.  This game is BEGGING for expansions.  I really hope for small expansions, like 1 hero expansions, or 1 villain or 1 environment.  Small expansions like this (say at a $5-$10 price point) would be great. Then you could purchase the ones that interest you the most and they could release them faster then large expansions (with say 2 or 3 heroes, a villain and a environment) Amazing Co-op game for 2-5 players. GET THIS GAME!

So many different scenarios you can set up with expansions you'll always get something different. It's really fun trying to figure out the best way to use your hero as well as how to use them with the others that are out there.
Very good solo game as well.
Keeping track of all the modifiers can be a bit of a chore, but after a while you get the hang of it. The sidekick app helps with this as well.

The game is not perfectly balanced, but it's fun, fun, fun.  Besides, with a cooperative game where the group wins and loses together, how crucial is balance really?  Greater Than Games is a very talented and passionate company and I look forward to picking up every single expansion they make for this game.

Update: So, the multiverse is indeed coming to an end in 2017 (ha, delayed until 2018).  I have ordered absolutely everything available for this game, and have to say with the end in sight, it's beautiful.

Good variety of heroes and powers, and some of the villains can really stick it to you. The environment effects are definitely a nice touch and add a lot to the game. The art style's not bad, but not as sharp as it could be; it does capture a sort of goofy feel, though, and that's better than trying to be too edgy.

RATING: 8.15
Great game, but the unpredictable play time means that it doesn't hit the table terribly often. However, still very fun and addictive.

The enhanced version is far superior to the original version in terms of bits. The storage in the box is great and the HP chits and modifiers are essential. Supposedly they balanced some cards as well, although I didn't play the original enough to notice a difference.

I agree with most of the complaints about this game (fiddliness, luck of the draw), but I think it makes up for its shortcomings. With the counters the fiddliness is reduced to a reasonable level. Depending on the characters and how many people are playing there can be a lot of tough decisions on your turn.

If you're looking for deeper strategy, Legendary may be a better bet. If you're looking for light strategy in a completely coop environment, Sentinels is better.

Cooperative super-hero game where each player controls a super-hero via a pre-built deck of powers and abilities.   Simple flow, draw a card, play a card, activate a power.  Lots of different heroes with multiple super-villains and the environmental decks add interesting challenges as well.   Little risk of alpha-player cooperative syndrome.   Quite a bit of tracking damage on villains and super-heroes.

10/26/2014 - Get the sidekick app. That took this game from 9 to 10 for me. With it, it is my favorite game in my collection. The rules are simple, more simple than everyone makes them out to be. If you research the heroes and play around with them, it can be very approachable for new players as well. feels like a comic in a game.

Update 12/31/2015: Still love the game, but the slight fiddliness that is left prevents me from breaking this out with new players as often. Moved from a 10 to a 9.5. Still stellar game though. I imagine it will always be one of my favorites.

One of the cooperative games I played (and I still play) the most.

Easy to learn and to teach. Tons of replayability owing to the many heroes / villains / environments provided by the base set... The cheap expansions even improve the replayability (some are better than others nevertheless).

Very fast to set up (no deckbuilding). Very fun to play. Many choices to be made in-game. I love that game. I hope it will be transleted to french in the future so that I will be able to "officially" review it.

Hvor er det dog vidunderligt forfriskende med et superheltespil og superskurke, som man gider at spille. Sentinels of the Multiverse formÃ¥r faktisk at levere den vare og det afgyder i sig selv rigtig meget respekt. Grundideen med at man samarbejder mod en superskurk syntes jeg i det hele taget ogsÃ¥ virker meget godt, men spillet har det med at blive lidt for langt og lang henad vejen virker det heller ikke som om, der er sÃ¦rlig mange meningsfulde valg. Det er helt sikkert et spil, der i den rette grund vil kunne affÃ¸de mÃ¦ngder af trash-talk, der fÃ¥r stemningen til at stige voldsomt. DesvÃ¦rre har jeg ikke haft lejlighed til at spillet spillet med en sÃ¥dan gruppe og det har sin effekt pÃ¥ min vurdering. Men absolut et spil det er vÃ¦rd at bruge lidt tid pÃ¥ og mÃ¥ske endda det bedste superhelte-spil pÃ¥ markedet.

Want to like this game, but it is fiddly to such an extent as to drag the game down.  So many modifiers coming and going every turn, it becomes a chore.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After about 20 plays or so. I still enjoy this one, but the flaws of the game are starting to wear on the plays a bit and the progression on challenge has been recently falling a but short.

Sentinels is a fairly easy game to learn and very fun on the first few plays. The amount of calculations can be overwhelming at first, but easily manageable with the iPhone app. Learning how each deck (character) works against weaker opponents is great. Discovering epic synergies between characters is a blast and using them to take down some of the harder villains is very satisfying and achieves a successful overall cooperative experience. Sentinels is not without its flaws, however.

The major issue is the degree of challenge. The higher difficulty villains have felt more punishing rather that challenging. A game design issue which is very difficult to deal with in coop games since the AI is simply a deck of cards, but important to establish to get a well-flowing game.  There has been too many situations where we were stuck in impossible situations, by bad draws, and ongoing effects by cards. Challenge is good, but being stuck in overwhelming situations in the FIRST round limits strategies and decision making. The players feeling hopeless and overwhelmed from the get go. 

Still, Sentinels is a blast, especially when players work together to defeat harder villains. Discovering that solid combo for your character or working up to do massive amounts of damage is awesome, a good enough reason to play despite its flaws.

Sentinels of the Multiverse, by first time designers Christopher Badell and Paul Bender (no relation, as far as I know), is a terrific superhero slugfest of fun. This co-op card game of superheroes teaming up to take down a dastardly villain takes about an hour to play and you will be eager to play again with a different hero or against a different villain as soon as you finish your first game. Also you will be coming back to enjoy the evocative art style and the fluff text on the cards will have you laughing.

Very thematic co-op superhero card game with great variety of comic book-style characters and pre-built decks. I loved the theme. Despite the art being somewhat amateur, it has its charm. However, this is the fiddliest game I have ever tried where you have to track all the numerous character powers, villains, location effects. Hard to play solo & enjoy because of this.

Excellent game, overflowing with theme.  Plays great solitaire and the variety with all the expansions is amazing.  I love the asymmetry with all the characters and villains.  I also love how this game is all about using your superhero powers directly to affect the enemy rather than some vague card-building mechanic that doesn't make nearly as much sense.  Its like having some awesome prebuild decks to play magic the gathering with!

I love the advance game option to make it really tough.  Brilliant, will invest more in the game as more of it comes out. 

The new version does make me a little upset because I now have to get rid of the old version, but the new (H) stat really scales the game beautifully for any number of players and makes it all worthwhile.  I also recommend getting the extra-large villain cards, they are brilliant and add more theme to the game (totally optional of course).  I got these with some Sentinels of the Multiverse T-shirts and the promo villain and hero that I ordered from Greater than games.  The T-shirts are AWESOME!

I love the game and have all the expansions.  With everything the replayability is immense.  It can be crunchy and hard to keep up with everything depending on which heroes, villians, or environments are out. 

My rating goes from 7-8 on this and can even get to the point where I don't want to play for a bit because it can get heavy at times. Keeping track of all the abilities and such can start to feel like work.  

That said, it's a very cool game and my son loves it.

The game has a lot of charm that I feel evens out a lot of the rough edges in the production and overall design. The artwork is just ok, the game mechanics are a little rough and certainly there isn't much balance to the characters and villains, but that is part of the fun. This isn't the superhero game that I keep dreaming will be produced someday, but it isn't bad. There is definitely some humor to the game and I get the impression that this game was a labor of love. I'd play this over Legendary which seems soulless in comparison.

Not sure how to rate this.  I'm nervous that it is too easy to win.  There was never any doubt that the heros wouldn't whittle the villain down to defeat in the 2 games I played.

Artwork, concept, and writing is super cool.  Verdict is out on game play.

[Update after 3 plays]  It's not a guarantee that the game is a win, but this game is boring.  The last 2 plays were just a tedious slog as I seem to wait for everyone to read and analyze every card in the deck.  30-45 minutes a scenario and this game would shine, but 90-120 minutes and I want to jump out the window.  I don't think I want to invest the time playing that it would take my gaming group to play faster.

Artwork, writing, theme, production are all AWESOME.  Game play is just not for me, heartbreaker.

The more I played this game, the more and more I felt that I wasn't really in control. You have a couple of choices, but not enough. You cant modify the heroes. They don't grow. There really wasn't a sense of accomplishment when beating this game.  I will say, that it does better when playing four heroes by yourself. So for that, the app is better than the board game. I would recommend to buy the app but not the board game.

Waste of cardboard. This game is so bad, it should not have seen the light of day....EVER! 

It's a card game, but you have no way of modifying your deck...or make it powerful or change it...

It's a coop game, but it has barely any interaction between players. 

It's a superhero game, but your character feels so weak and feeble comparing to how much dmg the environment alone can dish out, that is almost laughable.

Bad bad bad...Thinking that trees had to die in order to print this atrocity, makes one weep.

If you want to be a superhero, this is the game for you. You just feel like the hero you are playing. The decks are fixed, so you do not "build" before or during the game. Just pick you hero(s), villain, and environment and start playing. 
Some combinations of heroes, villain, and environment can result in lots of ongoing effects and some tedious tracking. Keep yourself organized and it's not bad. 
There is an app to help with all the tracking, but I have not used it, and I refuse to sully my tabletop experience with the video game version.

It's just not that great.  The game feels like the beginnings of a good idea for a game but falls short.  The cards are so imbalanced that the game can swing hard one way or another, with no input from you the player.  The nickel and dime accounting is clumsy.  Some people like it and maybe for them its about the journey or the story that unfolds, but i felt that game fell short on strategic depth and included unnecessary fiddlliness.  There are a lot of people that like it, but its so boring for me adding and subtracting ones and twos here and there to account for what or who gets damaged.

Sentinels of the Multiverse is the best co-op game I have played!
The theme of this game is incredible!  If you're a fan of super hero you must buy this game.  Even if you're not a fan of comics, you should try this game.  I have never red comics and I like this game a lot!

The replay value his great.  Just with the base game, the combinaison of heros, vilains and environments makes each game different.  Fighting Baron Blade in Megapolis will be different than fighting him in Wagner Mars Base.  I've beat Citizen Dawn on my third play and after my game the only word that could describe my play session was WOW!

I've played 14 time the first month I've got the game!  I can't think of a game that I want to play again and again like this one. I want to play more to see all the character abilities.

RATING: 7.8
All players work together as part of a hero team, each with their own unique deck of powers, weapons, and equipment, while the villain and environment decks conspire to destroy the heroes. The solo game play (I play controlling 4 heroes) is outstanding, my favorite game to play solo, when the wife is tired. The rules are simple but generate a great thematic card game full of opportunities for clever card play and meaningful decisions. This is a game with a ton of replay value. If you add in the expansions, you'll have enough game here to last a lifetime.

The gameplay seems so bland -- a very simple optimization puzzle every turn. And the flavor text calls to mind superhero comics from 50 years ago.

There is also something distinctly unsatisfying, for me, about chipping away at an enemy's enormous pile of health points.

I was introduced to Sentinels of the Multiverse by William Bell (the same weekend that I first learned 7 Wonders) and I really enjoyed it. I was still in my honeymoon period with Magic: The Gathering and the combo card play reminded me of my favorite aspects of MTG. 

So I came home from that weekend and purchased the first copy of the game I found (it was out of print at the time); this was the first cooperative game I'd ever played and the first I introduced to my family.

My wife didn't really care for it, although she would play from time to time. My sons however took a shine to the game and played it quite a bit on their own. Unfortunately for me, this meant they rarely felt like playing it when I wanted to.

Eventually I decided to trade it out of the collection--I'm not that interested in playing coops any more, and it didn't seem likely this was going to get played often enough to keep on the shelf.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Sentinels is a card game akin to Magic: the Gathering.  It is not collectible, but players each have their own unique deck comprised of dozens of cards with various abilities and powers.  As the game progresses, players will usually have multiple cards in front of them, each expanding or supplementing their powers, enhancing the powers of their teammates, or even hindering the power of the villain and his minions.  The ultimate goal is to take down the villain before he achieves his victory conditions, which are different for each adversary.

A word about the artwork:  it is excellent.  Adam Rebottaro is the artist, and if he is not already an artist for a comic book publisher, he should be.  He captures the look and feel of comic book superheroes.  In a nice touch, each card also contains a small blurb of banter that also evokes an appropriate comic book atmosphere.  In another pleasant surprise, the cards are completely devoid of those troublesome icons.  Each card contains all the text needed to understand its use â¦ and this is kept brief.  So, players don't have to remember the meaning of a mind-numbing avalanche of icons.

My biggest complaint against the game â and this is a deal-breaker for me â is its very nature.  As mentioned, it is somewhat akin to Magic: The Gathering, a game I've never played but based on my observations probably would not enjoy.  As more and more cards are played, there is a dramatic increase in the number of effects and modifiers that will apply to just about every subsequent card that is played.  This means that just about every time a card is played, every other card in play must be consulted to see whether or not it modifies the effect of the just-played card.  This is tedious, time consuming, calculating and, well, dull.  Many folks don't mind this process, but I find it sucks the very life out of a game.  Sadly, for me, it is a game killer.

Extremely dull cooperative game, with no interesting decisions and no sense of narrative. You just draw a card, play the best card, activate the best power (which in my case was the only power during the whole game), ad nauseum. The only thing in its favor is the superhero theme. I admit I'm not a fan of this type of game, with lots of different cards with text that can be in effect at the same time, but the biggest problem is that most effects are totally boring: deal damage, increase damage, reduce damage and draw cards. By the second round, I just wanted the game to end.

I am decidedly nonplussed about the apparent lack of balancing for number of players, and tracking HP is a pain. 
That said, I am sufficiently sold on the theme (the art and flavour text is great!) and the gameplay variety that I am willing to Kickstarter the expansion so as to get the mountain of free goodies.
[EDIT] Rendered completely obsolete by the revised edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Having made some effort into addressing the key defects of the first printing (HP tracking, balancing for player count) and some unessential upgrades (making a great-looking game even prettier), this is easily recommended. The best comic book game I've ever played, and also the very best fake comics canon I've ever seen.
[EDIT] I've had to downgrade my rating. I still love the game, but sometimes the "meta" of a given session is overly harsh on some characters. This isn't problematic from a difficulty perspective (it's a co-op, who cares), but it is extremely troublesome from a fun perspective--if your hero happens to be useless against a certain villain, the game will suck for you.

Game becomes fairly intuitive after a few plays.  We assign  one player to handle the Villain and Environment decks.

Sorting the tokens/markers helps.

Decks are pre-built, so you get right into the action.

Better than I expected it to be. A co-op card game, where each player selects a different deck of cards representing different super heroes. Together they try to defeat the big baddie, who has his own deck full of nastiness. I'm not sure how well balanced the characters are, but it's a fun romp. Art is decent, but not outstanding. Seems like the challenge level is a little too low for five players... may be better with fewer. 

I played as The Scholar, who looks just like The Dude, walking around in his bathrobe and shorts. I was highly amused by that.

Played at Gen Con.  I really want to rate this a lot higher- I thought the whole system functioned well together.  We played 3 player vs the robot factory thing.  We were at life totals 4, 4, and 1 (me) when it was at ~45 but still managed to nearly win!  It was excruciatingly tense for a coop card game.  I need to play this more to see how the other characters work.  I could definitely see this becoming a favorite.

The game works fine as a coop by itself. For me it just reminds me of everything I dislike about the coop genre. So if you don't like coop, you won't like this game. However if you like coop and dig the theme, then go for it.

Good super-hero feel. Can be a bit fiddly keeping track of status effects.
Works well with any number of players (varying difficulty though) but is more fun with more heroes.
Most games I've played have been two player games where each player controls one hero + 1 team controlled incapacitaded hero. Effects depending on number of heroes are evaluated to a minimum of 1 (e.g #heroes - 2 => 1 ).

Sentinels of the Multiverse takes a deck management game, with an original set of superheroes and does a pretty fair job of recreating the comic book days of pulp glory.
Each character (hero & villain) has their own deck, as do the different environments where hero/villain encounters take place.
From simple play rules, the various powers in the decks seem to play out nicely, challenging the heroes to stop the villains before the heroes are defeated or the villain's nefarious plans succeed. 
The design is simple, yet the play is not, and heroes strengths and weaknesses play into winning or losing.
At a start I'm ranking this a 7.25 but can easily see that increasing if it proves as addictive as it is rumored to be.

Absolutely amazing game. Each superhero, villain and location has their own distinct flavor and feel. The game-play is simple enough to jump right into a game with new players, yet has enough depth for veterans to enjoy over and over again. With so many superheroes that play differently, villains that behave uniquely and locations that have their own dangers, the combinations are mind-blowing. On top of that, a second game with the setup can be a whole new beast. I can't recommend this game enough.

Love it. love it love it love it. I have all the expansions. The only bad thing is, I feel like some of the characters need some balancing. Absolute Zero is absolute trash when against a villain who doesn't deal fire or ice damage. Argent Adept has literally only 2 attack cards and needs a few turns to even setup. Such a shame because Argent Adept is my favorite to play.

Cool game but keeping track of everything is difficult.  The video game version is much better at keeping track of stuff however so far you can't get the expansions.  Also when you first start playing and have to read every card it can take a while to reach your turn.

Did not like this one at all. Good artwork, but too much damage types to keep track of and will always need at least 3 players or someone running two decks for just a slight chance at winning. 

The rules are simple enough, but I think that ruined it also for me. Felt a waaaay too streamlined in not giving a player enough to do on their turn. I'm sure different heroes/decks allow this, but did'nt keep my copy long off after 2 plays. 

However...The app version of this game is so much superior in the fact that it tracks pretty much every thing and you don't have worry about all the annoying book keeping. Stick to the app version. I'd rate the app around a 7

RATING: 6.7
It is a co-op; all the players are trying to defeat the big bad guy in an environment, both which are chosen from many options at setup. Each player chooses a character from many options, getting their personal deck of cards.

The cards have a ton of text on them--twice as much as Smash Up.
This is one of those games where it would be good to know generally how your character should function, so repeat plays are kind of required. There is also a lot of basic math flying around--lots of adding from this card effect, subtracting from that card effect. Not quite as crazy as Suburbia's growing tableau of effects, but similar. Easy to miss things.

So not my cup of tea.
That being said, I would maybe be willing to play this game one more time because the particular setup we did was absolutely dismal for my chosen character. 
I chose Fanatic, who has many cards based around hindering the bad guys' minions. Only we were fighting Plague Rat, whom had no minions appear. If I were familiar with my character, it would have become "keep drawing cards and hope you draw the card that does a ton of damage when you're nearly dead." Eh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really WANT to like this game, because the concept and art direction are fantastic. I've got 2 plays in, and so far it feels very much like the draws that the villian gets completely determine the game, and your strategy doesn't accomplish much. One game we had our hands empty for most of the time because we got a few hand wiping cards in a row. Maybe after more plays this will pick up, but after the first few it is hard to choose this game over our many others.

RATING: 3
When I see this game on my self, I want to play it. When I play it, I want to put it back on the shelf.

The theme of this game is SO appealing! I love the concept of how each player picks a different hero deck and together we work towards overthrowing the villain. Pretty straight forward right? But what makes this so appealing is that the superheroes are all new and original. Sure there are elements that are CLEARLY borrowed from other more well known heroes, but not so tactless were it's just a reskinning.

But why this gets such a low rating from me is because of the fiddliness of the game. There are constant +1, -1 damage modifiers happening. What type of damage being done is also constantly changing. 

It seems so hard to get good combos to happen with your cards. Some heroes do not work well with others. So this requires heavy familiarity with the game from the git-go.

The whole experience leaves me feeling like there's something missing from the game.

RATING: 4.5
Game I liked at first, and really wanted to like.  In fact, to begin with I liked it better as a superhero game than any of the deckbuilders with that theme.  However, I tired of it quickly.

Sentinels works really well on the easier levels with easier bosses and is a fun game.  However, it becomes tedious when you ramp up the difficulty of the villains.  The actual damage dealt per action by most heroes is quite low and the villains have high HP.  In addition, the more difficult heroes and villains have tons of static effects that are all in play later in game, making it necessary for there to be tokens just to keep track of all the effects, and making the turns take forever because everything you do involves multiple calculations to see what effects happen and how much damage is done to whom.

In general, the game involves a great deal of one step forward two steps back.  Between that and all the unnecessary fiddliness of all the actions, it starts to feel like cooperative Agricola with superheroes.  I play a lot of Euros, and if I want to sit down for 2 hours APing moves and calculating the 3rd step ramifications of each play, I have a whole shelf of cube pushers I can turn to.

P&P

Es un juego cooperativo en el que trabajas junto a otros super-compaÃ±eros con el fin de derrotar al megalomanÃ­aco que acosa a los ciudadanos del entorno. Pretende simular el sabor de las pÃ¡ginas finales de un cÃ³mic en el que el supergrupo se enfrenta al villano en un Ã©pico combate definitivo. Aunque no me van mucho los juegos cooperativos, creo que es lo suficientemente difÃ­cil como para necesitar de todos los jugadores.

Â¿Realmente transmite la sensaciÃ³n de llevar a un superhÃ©roe? NO. Transmite la sensaciÃ³n de estar viendo (Â¿leyendo?) un cÃ³mic de superhÃ©roes.

En teorÃ­a, la idea es buena y con sentido: mazos individuales cerrados con poderes Ãºnicos coordinÃ¡ndose para vencer un peligro comÃºn. Muy de superhÃ©roes. AdemÃ¡s, su mecÃ¡nica es, en lÃ­neas generales, sumamente sencilla. El villano juega desvelando una carta y cumpliendo sus efectos. Luego juegan los superhÃ©roes jugando una carta, activando un poder y robando una carta y por Ãºltimo juega el mazo de entorno, sacando otra carta de su mazo. La mitad de la diversiÃ³n consiste en imaginar las sinergias entre distintos hÃ©roes para derrotar al villano.

PROS: La cantidad de personajes, de villanos y de entornos (contexto en dÃ³nde se juega) es tan elevada que su rejugabilidad es prÃ¡cticamente inagotable. Incluye un modo avanzado para hacerlo mÃ¡s difÃ­cil (supongo que tras las 25 primeras partidas). Combina personajes de Marvel y de DC. Grafismo.

CONS: Conforme aumenta el nÂº de cartas jugadas, hay un gran incremento de efectos y modificadores que se aplicarÃ¡n a cada carta que se juegue de ahÃ­ en adelante. Eso significa que al jugar una carta se deben consultar las anteriores para comprobar si modifican o no su efecto. Eso es tedioso y las matemÃ¡ticas acaban de dominar a la inmersiÃ³n. Por ello, necesitas a alguien que estÃ© auditando continuamente al supervillano y al entorno, ademÃ¡s de a su propio personaje para no olvidar ningÃºn efecto de sus cartas.

Derivado de lo anterior, como es necesario jugar con al menos 3 hÃ©roes para tener opciones, esto reduce sus posibilidades de jugarse en solitario porque se vuelve complicado jugarlo controlando 3 mazos + entorno + villano.

Por Ãºltimo, todo el juego estÃ¡ vinculado a la variable "daÃ±o". Si la carta que has jugado no hace daÃ±o, es porque da un bonus a otra que si lo hace o te proporciona una reduccciÃ³n al que te hacen los enemigos. Esto le resta variedad a las estrategias y quizÃ¡ sea algo repetitivo.

I prefer this to other deck-based superhero games because it feels like you're actually playing characters versus a villain and not just playing with cards with pictures of trademarked images on them.

The variety in the characters available with expansions is incredible.

Super hero deck builder cooperative.  Some heroes are much better than others.  The sort of game where you can end up doing all the grunt work to support and buff up a fellow player so they can do all the combat (like Robinson Crusoe where you can just gather food all game long so others can get us off the island). Needs the two expansions to flesh out player choices.  Not willing to buy them.

RATING: 6.5
Quite fun game but doesn't work that well as a two-player experience in my opinion. I also found it more book-keepy than I was happy with. The maths is simple but I want my turns to feel like "I smash the villain with this bus!" Rather than "OK, so there's two damage here and one from that thing, and one from that other thing, less two for that thing." Simple to learn though, lots of variety and replayability, just didn't quite click for me.

Admittedly, I loved it back when we played it regularly, but that love evaporated completely after we came to the realization that this game has two notes: Impossible to lose (99% of the time) or impossible to win (1% of the time). And you know which it is going to be before you play. Had a close game that we won *once*, when we took an unbalanced team to fight Iron Legacy.

The strategy in this game comes, in part, from picking a squad of heroes that can counter the particular villain and environment you are going up against; this will not be apparent to players until they've played a few times. The rest of the strategy lies in card play choices, which are not always as obvious as some critics claim. Sure, you can simply play the card that does the most damage, but there are times when that's not a winning strategy. Figuring that out is part of the fun. (I'm rating this as a solo game played on the app, which handles the "modifier tracking" duties. And, in my experience, multiplayer coop mode reduces the sense of individual control and the amount of fun to be had. Your mileage may vary.)

learned from the rules - co-op card game. We played the first time with 2 players and were getting wrecked. Tried again with 2 characters each which seemed to balance things out.  It's an OK game of picking the right card from your hand, and does have some interaction where you try to coordinate strategies.  Lots of decks, probably a good value.  If you like superheros, you should get it.  If you like coops, you should have a look. if you aren't a big fan of either, it's a pass

RATING: 6
A game that does a wonderful job at realizing its theme (superheroes fighting against agents of evil and corruption), but is just too damn fiddly for its own good a lot of the time. 

I will describe two polar opposite experiences one can have even within a single game of Sentinels:

There are moments that, when the various decks interact with each other and within their own design, the gameplay just takes on a wonderful flow, and the cards and counters and underlying mechanisms melt away and one truly feels like a part of a super-powered team trying to save the world against overwhelming odds. 

And then there are moments when the game screeches to an abrupt halt as players struggle to keep track of all the various damage modifiers, conditions, and card effects and counter-effects such that the only heroic feeling comes from having actually managed to fully complete a turn feeling like you didn't make any errors or oversights (which, let's face it... you still messed up somewhere along the line). 

This makes for an incredibly erratic game experience. When it works? The game is great and a lot of fun. When it doesn't? It's about as tedious as it gets. I'm finding myself wanting to play less and less as the prospect of trying to keep track of everything just makes the prospect of playing the game not as appealing when I can play other games that give way more back for the same amount of effort.

I'm not a huge co-op fan but this is quite good for a co-op. It is a little fiddly to play but in exchange you get ridiculously easy rules and simple setup. That trade off means this game is getting a lot more play around our house right now than comparable games (Pathfinder Adventure Card Game for example).

RATING: 7.5
I enjoy this game, and have many expansions offering unlimited variety but: 

(1) you need more than 2 heroes - the variant isn't as good as I'd hoped.  So, either find 4 or 5 players or, play 2 heroes each.  

(2) it's fiddly - a lot to keep track of during the game.

The 2-player variant in Geek forum looks promising both for solo play and for games when there are just two of us:
-Each player selects a hero, remaining hero cards (just the hero card, not the deck) are shuffled with the incapacitated side up and made into a sidekick deck.
-Before environment turn, do a sidekick turn.  Each player gets to use one of the 3 incapacitated powers (may each choose the same), then the sidekick gets discarded and the next turn, another sidekick is available.
-Use H=3.

First off, I am not the target audience for this so take that into consideration with my comments and such, was never into comics or even Superheroes all that much. Having said that, that was something that bugged me right off the hop, the fact the heroes were generic nobody's (apparently Legendary does that part right) 

The game was very standard fare, and nothing notable really stood out about it for me other than co-operating 'seemed' important so hopefully teamwork is rewarded (well any co-op failing to do that is a failure though...). Personally I think its more suited to kids artwork and theme-wise and [i]almost[/i] game-wise, but it seems I am in the minority here maybe thinking this and note comic books fans should be happy with the artwork I believe. Thing is too I said almost game-wise as, well, decisions are very light, but there is a lot of text everywhere and things to keep track of (even a PITA for adults), so younger kids likely couldn't handle it that well. I'm guessing here maybe 8-10 years and up, and to me I think it makes a great family game where you would play it with your kids and have a good time doing so.  

I think for the target audience its a good co-op, and a fairly thematic one, you are a team fighting against the bad guys, however theme could have been stronger too as its missing narrative/story arc, characters are generic and some other things could have made it feel more thematic as well. Card stock seemed good in version I played, but lots of duplicate cards in the decks and some things were not balanced well either. Due to theme and the very standard gameplay where there just isn't that many interesting decisions (try to do as much damage as you can, maybe heal if you can, the only interesting part is just the discussions) there just isn't anything to really draw me back to it personally. Maybe the intro scenario is that much more lame than the others not sure but even if so I really didn't see any reason to come back to it. If it played in 30 or 40 mins tops my rating would likely be a point or two higher, 1 hour or especially more than that to me is too long for what if offers.

Fun, but a bit fiddly to play solo. Theme is great and it provides a great spread of challenges to cater to how you feel for the play. If you want to beat up a baddie, then you can play an easier villain. If you want a tension-filled fight then you can play a harder one. I enjoy playing it when I do but often I find myself skipping over it for something else (needing to play three-handed and keep up with all of the health values and damage modifiers myself is the cause of the skipping in nearly every instance).

Love this game.  Love the flavor.  Love the lore.  Love the individualized heroes.  Love the endless combinations to try.  Love the fact that I can play solo with three players and it not be overly difficult to manage.  

One of the major complaints is that the game is fiddly, and it is.... that is a completely valid point, but it is also managable with the correct resources.  

I also use the app on steam - fantastic.  I recommend this game to anybody that would enjoy the theme.  Would love it even more if there was some sort of official campaign mode or if there was some level of customization that could be made to the individual decks.  Like 10 card "sideboards" of sorts.  Just to offer an extra layer of strategy or to make the game a little more of your own.

Fun thematic superhero card game. It's easy to play but not trivial to win (though I think I'm 4-0 so far, but some of those were nailbiters), and mostly I just really like the characters. I do love super hero comics though. And there are some cool combos your cards can pull off. Does feel a little silly that you show up to a battle basically completely unprepared and have to spend some time hoping your best gear shows up, but somehow this doesn't really bother me as I'm playing. I feel like I shouldn't enjoy this game as much as I do and I don't really understand why but it's just a really fun experience.

A great co-op card game.  Lots of variety with all the different heroes you can play as, each with their own unique deck and play style.  Lots of villains to fight, again each with their own deck and mechanics.

The balancing mechanic for more or less players doesn't always work particularly well.  Some seem more tuned to more or less players, making them exceedingly difficult if you're playing with the "wrong" number of players.

It's not a breezy card game.  The cards often have a lot of text, and some cards have multiple effects that trigger at different times during a turn, sometimes forcing you to read several cards multiple times in a single turn.

But overall an extremely fun game with the right group that encourages communication and team work.

RATING: 6
The mechanics of Sentinels of the Multiverse can be so fidgety game as to potentially ruin the game, but the theme is so strong here I can deal with it. It really does feel like the players are a team of superheroes using their unique abilities to thwart a villain. That, combined with good number of heroes, villains, and environments give the game excellent replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Pros: 
To me, the theme of this game is its strength.  The Superhero world it creates satisfies my desire to play some of my favorite Superheroes (Like Batman/Wraith and Flash/Tachyon) while introducing some really unique and cool characters as well (like The Argent Adept and Mr. Fixer).  While the world Greater than Games has created is amazing, no doubt, I feel the ultimate thematic success of this game lies within how well the mechanics of each deck works so well with each superhero's abilities.

There are a number of other things I like about this game.  I love the art in this game.  I love the co-op nature of the game.  And I love the diversity of characters and mechanics in the game.

Con:  I have one complaint about this game, and unfortunately, its the game play itself.  My only complaint about this game is that unless you are playing one of the more complex characters, the decks feel to me like they pretty much play themselves.  I know people talk about how hardcore gamers and non-gamers alike can participate in this game, but I feel like save for a couple heroes (like Absolute Zero) you are pretty much hoping to draw "that one card" and simply flipping through a deck of cards praying you don't die.

An awesomely thematic game, it is just not fun to me.  Overall, a good game but not a great game.

I've played dozens of games now, and it hasn't gotten old yet.  The first edition rules had a lot of ambiguities and it didn't scale well, but it was still fun if you had enough players (4 or 5).

With all the heroes, villains, and environments, especially with the expansions, it plays differently every time.

Good game. Definitely fun and the theme is amazing. Great variety and replayability. However, I couldn't rate it better due to the chaotic nature of the game.

I was enthusiastic about this when we got it, and we gave it a go for several games.  But it just wasn't much fun.  All the card modifications were difficult to keep track of, and some were hard to figure out what they meant, which kept the game from getting momentum for us.  

The heroes were very derivative--I think if the game was more original or quirky with its heroes, the flavor of the game would have been considerably improved.  As it was, they felt pretty bland.  Much of the card art was also not up to the standard of a game based on the premise of comics, although this could be a function of the ambitiousness of all the cards made for the game.

Fun co-op game where it really feels like you're fighting a big bad villain. Every turn feels like you're just barely scraping by sometimes until you can finally make that big push to bring the villain down.

Can be a bit difficult to track some effects and I would recommend having a player who has a bit of experience track all the crazy combinations of effects that can be going on at once. The steam version nicely handles this for you but if you're playing the physical version it takes a bit of work.

RATING: 10
Is there a way to give this an 11! This game has it on every level. If your a comic fan the characters have great flavor, and are thinly veiled versions of heros you love. The wraith feels like you're Batman, beating up thugs with gadgets and martial arts. Legacy protects people and inspires them like superman, and the villans each feel completely different. That's probably the coolest thing about the game. In the core set, Grand Warlord Voss plays like a young Thanos taking over a world with his army of mercenaries where as Barron Blade feels like a base you're attacking to stop his super death ray he's built in a lab. The mechanic for each villan makes it feel like a completely different game- which is fantastic. I love the nods to the comics as well. Visionary has a card with art that's her using her physic powers to mind wipe a villain, and it's a homage to the art from x-men 25 where Xavier wipes Magneto. It shows that the makers know and care about the material. Finally what makes it fun is the difficulty. It's really hard. We lost the first three games we played against baron blade with two people and we had a blast doing it. Iron Legacy from the new expansion is even worse, and the one time we beat him we didn't even play him using one of his mechanics. So when you win together you feel like you really earned it! The only complaint I see is that I do feel like the game could scale a little bit better. The cards have an X=the number of players, mechanic so they're harder with more people,  but if you do play with 5 people, I do feel like you roll the villain pretty easily. Id say 3 is the magic number, 2 is fun and REALLY hard, and 4 is on the easy side with some villains, but still great. Overall Greater Then Games has really hit the nail on the head, and I look forward to there "firefly" style game they've announced.

RATING: 8
Very fun. Slow starting with all the text.  Variable powers that mix well.  A lot to keep track of late in the game.  Very thematic.

A solid eight for me given it's depth and variablity.  I can't go perfect on this one, because it can get hard to keep up with all the rule "effects" and math for complicated combos...but fun making the combos.  

You really need teamwork to keep track of everything.  I would bump it higher if it came with ways to streamline it better.  All those number and ability tokens don't help that much.

What a good game. Iâm pleasantly surprised :D. After playing Legendary (and hearing the negative comments of the DC comics one), I didnât want to play more super hero games with decks in it, however I really like this game. Sentinels of the Multiverse has a huge potential to rise higher in my ratings, after all I love card games.

The game has some interesting decisions, but it is not very hard to play. What I mean, is that gameplay is not very deep, but it is FUN.

Its main strength is the theme, the outstanding art and the easy mechanics.  Also the play time is around 1 hour. 

The components are adequate, but the cards begin to degrade pretty quickly, they need to be sleeved ASAP. I really feel this is a 2 or (preferably) 3 player game, with 4 I begin to feel the downtime.

My main concern is the game has a low replay value as my main interest would be to kill each villain, also as the game is not deep, I fear it would bore me pretty soon. For now I want to play again and I will comment on my finds.

Now I feel this is strictly a 3 player game. With 2 players the game tends to be (almost impossible) too hard to beat, with 4 or more players it gets way too easy, besides with 4 or 5 players the down time is excessive. With 3 players it is a hard game, but still beatable and very fun to play!

I still like Sentinels of the Multiverse a lot. I think I will buy every card and expansion for it. My replayability concerns werenât true, each game plays differently even if you play with the same heroes against the same villain. One of the best cooperative games I have played. Nowadays I will only play it with 3 players.

Currently, Iâm loving Sentinels of the Multiverse and I need to buy all the expansions for it :D. If we are playing face to face I prefer to play with 3 fast players but I would play up to four, with 5 players the downtime is too much for me. If Iâm playing it solo on the iPad, I can play with 5 heroes without any issue. 

Good game, perhaps it can continue to climb up my personal ratings!

Sentinels of the Multiverse is one of my all-time favorite games. The game play is incredibly diverse from one hero to the next and one villain to the next. It is a bit fiddly with all of the different effects that can be active at one time, but that also creates some really fun and thematic elements in the game. On top of that, the designers have done an incredible job of creating a very thematic superhero universe in a card game.

Love that I'm five years late to this party.  Better late than never?  Now off to search for all these OOP expansions...

This is my first super hero board game (card game to be precise), it's a wonderful experience playing it as it wasn't too complex as it generally requires more than 90 minutes to play. Faster game is around 45-60 minutes, which is just nice for another game. The variety is the most wonderful thing about this game, with three combination of Heroes, Villains and Environment, the effects can be really amazing. We played two sessions of play testing as I was trying to understanding the game rules and game flow and yesterday we played a flawless game of barely defeating the Ennead villains, very interesting and tough.

A very interesting and exciting inclusion of my game collection and it certainly is a very unique and outstanding game! Thumbs up to the designer!

[Update 1] Played four sessions so far, first two were testing, played with errors. Third was really good, and fourth was most amazing! This game is absolutely blowing my mind away, it is really good, challenging and thematic, unpredictable and full of surprises! Man, it gives me the feeling why didn't I discover this game much much earlier! It was a blast! 

[Update 2] After playing this game close to 50 games, 5 months down the road since I bought the game in November 2015, all that I can say is this game is really marvelous! And since November last year, our gaming group have not played any other games except SotM! It is that good and that nice! And, we still strongly feel that we haven't played it enough...man, this game may potentially makes you forget about your family, friends and your life... lol.

Good game, however it is quite difficult with two players (when only using two heroes). We tend to use multiple heroes to make the game more fun.

RATING: 7.6
Never has a game made you feel so much like a superhero,  when this game works it plays out fantastically with heroes, villains and even the enviroment adding to the mayhem.

Unfortunately with so much going on the game can bog down with alot of variables all taking effect simultaniously.

Hopefully this is just a side effect of playing solo and having to juggle the many different cards in play.

Once I received the other two hero based games by DC and Legendary I researched this game. Many hours of research later and I saved up my money. Bought the game and all the expansions with it. 
An absolutely incredible game. This is a co op, that can be soloed. The mechanics, the cards, the artwork are all top notch. 
With so many Hero combination (3 to 5 heroes play at a time) and all the villians and throw in all the enviroments, no two games will ever be the same. There is so much depth to this game that it will always be played. No dust on this one. 
Just go out and Buy it.

This is an ok game, I just didn't like the trying to keep track of all the loop holes created by the cards that were being played.  But that said this is what the core of the game is trying to play cards to create work arounds based on the obstructions by the villians.

I really wanted to like this game. I love the theme; I love the concept of picking a deck that represents a unique superhero; I absolutely love the art and design. Sadly, though, it just fell flat for me. I played it twice, and the hand of cards just never seemed to present very interesting decisions to me.

2014-04-23 - Update: Played this again recently, and I had to up my rating from a 6 to a 7.5. This game is a good bit better than my first experiences led me to believe. I think a combination of complicated character and bad deck draws ruined the first game, and I maybe didn't give the second game enough of a chance. This is a pretty simple game, to be sure, and very fiddly, but I had fun playing it and am curious to see how other heroes work. I won't be buying it, but I will happily play it again, given the chance.

2017-11-06 - And we're down to a 5 on this one. There just aren't enough interesting decisions, and there's just too much to keep track of.

Love it or hate it, this game is solid. I like having my own character deck. I hate getting destroyed by villains.

1 play with 5

I would like to try this one again since I like the idea of a superhero group. But there are things that concern me about the game.

We played against Spite who accumulates drug cards throughout the game which is a bit of a hassle as we had to work through the timing of each card. It just slows the game down.

The bigger issue for me was that two of our heros(Mr. Fixit and Visionary) were pretty much shut down in this game since their decks didn't seem to be built to handle the particular villain we played against.

Our group was victorious even though we only had two heros(Tachyon and Absolute Zero) who dealt any significant damage. Tempest who was the remaining hero dealt some big damage before Spite flipped and in looking back didn't play much of a part the rest of the game.

When we play again we'll look to make a team of heros that can each make some kind of active contribution.

RATING: 8
This has been a hit so far. Lives up to my expectations. Has great battles, tough descisions, VERY thematic gameplay. Was positively surprised by the way you have to use the environment to your advantage. Each hero and villain has lots of personality and plays differently. Only played 2p so far, think this will really shine with 3 or 4 heroes. 'Gamer' gamers shouldn't worry about the complexity level of the heroes, if you can learn RFTG you can easily start with a complexity 3 hero

RATING: 7
Game play gets a 5 or 6 in my book. However, this game has exceptional character and that alone holds good fun for players who can really dive into the theme. So, my rating here is primarily driven by the great artwork, humor, and characterizations. The game successfully creates a unique and fun universe. The gameplay? Lots of cards that change gameplay and provides modifiers. As the game wears on, keeping track of all the modifiers, options, and special rules gets tedious. Some people are a-ok with that, some are not. I'm not, but the game's great character makes all the work almost tolerable...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It's neat, but there's other co-ops that I'd rather play. I agree it's probably the best superhero-themed game out there, but the theme isn't enough for me to want to keep playing over other co-ops.

I never turn down playing this game. I always enjoy it.

It can be a brain burner, and some hero > villain > environment combinations are unrewarding. And you'll love it for its quirks and come back for more, if you're anything like me. 

One factor I really appreciate that isn't often mentioned: all the art is by one person, Adam Rebottaro. This goes a long, long way toward creating a consistent game universe; plus, his art is colorful, playful, and strong on characterization.

Dominion was one of the first board games I played and since then deck builders has always been a favorite type of game for me. I have always liked superheroes so I tried DC deck building game. I liked DC deck building game a lot but to me it doesn't have the charm this game has. The artwork is outstanding and there is so much charm in such a small game. The coop play is amazing and to me it works for light gamers and heavy gamers because of the differing complexities of the characters.

RATING: 6
Very fun game with lots of interesting combos between the various different heros and villains.  It's a shame that they don't have a Marvel/DC license for this game as playing with familiar heros would likely have boosted my enjoyment even more (I'm a theme junkie) but even as is, there is an amazing amount of gameplay here when you consider all the expansions as well.

Full disclosure - My rating is based on the app and not the physical game.  I have heard lots of complaints around how fiddly the physical version is but I don't have any experience of this as I only play on the app.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun coop (one of the few). Alpha player is not really an issue here, though certain roles (healer/tank) have quick and sometimes unexciting turns while others have a bit more flavor (maybe that's just the case generally with these types of roles?).

Not fun to teach (simple rules with millions of exceptions that you have to explain over and over again). 

I've heard the app version is good though I've yet to play it. 

Another downside is the fiddly bits. Keeping track of health with chits is a drag.

One of the few games I very much enjoy playing solo.

SotM is a superb experience game. I love how simple it is to get started or explain to someone new. Each super-hero has their own deck of cards, you grab it and get down to business. The heroes play very differently from one another, learning how to play each effectively and with different teammates is a lot of fun.

The game is quite fiddly, but it doesn't bother me much. I could see this being a big problem for some people.

Played the PC version on Steam - Finally a cooperative battle game I enjoy. Probably because it's about hand management and tableau building, not deckbuilding. The combinations of heroes, villains and environments decide on the difficulty. Single games will cover the whole span from a walk in the park (with some experience) to well-nigh impossible. The electronic version adds to the enjoyment with sound and eases gameplay by taking over the administrative tasks. Interested to see how it plays on the table.

This is a game that for me is the perfect take it or leave it game.  I don't care about the theme, but I also don't hate it.  I don't care for the gameplay, but I also don't hate it.

As far as Super hero games go, I would rather play DC Deckbuilding. I know its a thematic mess. (you can kick a punch? You beat a villain and he/she goes into your deck and fights for you?) But the gameplay is just more fun.

But my daughter just ADORES this game.  So I'll play it with her, when no one else will.

Edit: lowered to 4.  I'll play it with her, when no one else is AROUND.

RATING: 7.5
A nice light game with superheros.  It's got a feel that I used to get playing superhero rpgs.  It's excellent for that.  If you don't like superheroes, then ignore my score, cause you're probably not going to like this game purely on a mechanical basis.

I think the rulebook and some of the card descriptions are going to lead to confusion.  If you got a group that doesn't like to come up with house rules, there is going to be trouble.  For example, I'm still not sure what happens in the case of a tie for a target and there's sometimes where adding/reducing damage cards can be a bit confusing.

I also worry a bit some of the heroes might be a bit unbalanced.

I think tightening up some of the language on the cards and the rulebook in future versions of the game might help. Some sort of breaking up of the text of the cards to the phase they take affect in would have helped.  (So environment and villain cards could have had START: and END: in bold. 

Still, good fun and I can't think of anything on the market like it.

Cool concept, but I think that in trying to come up with "different" superpowers, the designers have made the game too complex. When you have so many villain cards to keep track of, all the effects intertwined with one another, the game becomes quite awful.

This game would be better off simplified, with less text and fewer bosses that frustrate and cause both sides to do nothing each turn.

So much constant interaction between players. Even when it's not your turn you're still involved. This is the way a cooperative game should be.

The listed time of 60 minutes seems unrealistic unless maybe if you've played the game dozens of times. After 4 plays it still takes 2-2.5 hours for a session. But just as it feels like it's starting to drag, it wraps up pretty quickly. The game can be pretty fiddly with lots of conditional actions to keep track of.

I've been surprised how often the game plays out like a superhero movie. Starts off slow, revealing the villain's plans gradually, then starts beating you down pretty hard. Then when all seems lost, the heroes make a miraculous comeback to win the day victorious. Or that doesn't happen and you are utterly destroyed. Either way it's always fun.

Fun solo game where I can just pull out decks and play, rather than have to deck-build. (Play as 3 heroes rather than 4 to make more difficult and have less to manage.) While you need to think, it's a bit luck dependent in card draws. Also, there can be a lot of fiddliness in tracking effects. Still, the fun cartoony Silver Age comic theme makes up for it, making it stand out from other games.

Score is almost entirely for the app version. This game had so much bookkeeping it should never have been released as a physical game. Since the app was released I have not played the physical card game and have no intention of doing so. Great theme and fantastic artwork on the cards, ruined by a system nearly unplayable without computer assistance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
We are really not feeling this game.  We might still be soured that the rulebook never offers that you MUST have at least three heroes in play, no matter the number of players.  It lets you assume 2 player/2 heroes is factored in. It SO isn't. 

Now that we've played 2 player with 2 heroes each, it is a little better, but still hardly any decisions to make when it is your turn. Mostly it's waiting to see how the Environment and Villain decks pummel you each round. If you survive you get to play your one card/one power (if your drawing luck doesn't block that on its own), then wait for the more interesting envirmonment and villain cards again.  A solid MEH so far. We MUCH prefer Legendary, since you get to do SO much more on your turn.

I like the artwork, sometimes, but other times do not. I can see obvious parallels to the comic Powers, but other times I can't help but notice flaws and mediocre pieces.

Would probably become quickly bored with heroes and villains, so understand why the expansions. No strong desire to re-buy cardboard but looking forward to more app play.

To much fiddly rules to read on each card. The game is mildly interesting and the customizability is immense, but the game is one of the least elegant or fluid games I've ever played. 

Without a player present who has memorized every card, players are bound to miss a number of minor interactions and the time taken to read everything is more than it should be. It is not uncommon for a game to take 2+ hours to play.

Plus, there is a lot of downtime between actions and, like most coop games, the player's ability to win is dependent on random luck.

Genuinely surprised at how good this game plays. It really feels like you're playing a group of unique (and awesome) superheroes aiming to take down an overpowered boss. There is also a ton of cards in the base game, (about three times as much as I got from an unnamed LCG that I paid the same price for), allowing for a lot of variety and replayability in one box.

If there is a minor downside, it's that at least three heroes are required for balance, and this means juggling a lot of card/tokens when playing solo.

This game sounds right up my alley. It's got original and unique superheroes, is cooperative, has cool artwork and cards, and simple but deep gameplay. However, there are so many modifiers that can happen over the course of the game that it seems nearly impossible to track without having eidetic memory. There is an app to help you keep track of all the tokens, but at that point, I would rather just play the digital version of the game because it will do all the work for me. Wish the game had been simplified and streamlined in this respect. Great idea, but tough to get to the table and tough to keep track of everything.

The biggest criticism of Sentinels is the extensive bookkeeping, and it's absolutely an issue. As the game progresses there can be a huge number of things to keep track of - things that happen at the start of a turn, things at the end, things triggered by things - this is pretty brutal if you're playing solo and trying to run several characters, but much less problematic if you're going multiplayer and everyone just has one hero to track. I don't recommend solo play until you've played enough that handling effects becomes second nature. That aside, bright and colorful, with lots of flavor, and you can really feel the different characters' identities, so there's a lot of fun to be had...as long as you're not too put off by all the tiny text you need to keep track of.

Fantastic co-op, kind of feels like a deck builder to play without the tedious durdling around that goes into making your deck. 

The Environment deck is genius and adds an extra level of sophistication that just isn't there in the DC Heroes DBG.

If you are finding the Villains too easy try going randomly selected Heroes...suddenly things are a lot more challenging without Legacy giving his bonus!!

The expansions make this game...Rook City and Infernal Relics are both must haves.

Edit: After a two year break Upped to a perfect 10...one of the best co-op games ever made!

As an avid comic read for Both Marvel and DC I would like to say WOW. This game takes the theme or superheros and creates an amazing game. It's a great Co-op game that looks and feels like a comic superhero!

Puh, that one is hard to rate/recommend. Sentinels is an awesome coop game and probably also the best superhero themed game at all. It has a good deal of different strategies and is quite easy to teach. However, it also is quite fiddly and become get really really exhausting when playing because of that.
Still, despite that mixed feelings its one of my favorites.

RATING: 8.5
This game gets big props for its excellent art and character design, effectively creating a comic book mythos from scratch. This is a cooperative game that feels like you're playing out the contents of a comic book, with different heroes having strikingly different playstyles. With a group of friends, SOTM can be a tense and rewarding session, and the additional villains and heroes that come with expansions and available individually combine to make for a seemingly endless variety of villain/hero team combinations.

My biggest gripe with the game comes from the different ways the heroes play. My default way of picking characters is at random, especially with people that haven't played before. This can significantly amplify the difficulty, especially if a small group has a "support" character that isn't able to do much. Keep in mind that team construction matters a lot, and that the challenge of the game can be amplified considerably based on what heroes you have and what villain you fight, because the game is inherently unbalanced (which isn't a bad thing, but should be made aware of). Great game all around, highly recommended.

Co-op game which really wants to be a videogame.  Basically going through the motions on the cards, which can be super arduous as you read block after block of rules text.  Even with all the blocks of rules text, it is difficult to remember all of the different effects in play most of the time.  If everyone says what they have in their hands, it turns into a game of "what should I do player who knows all the cards best?"

The theme is great though, and the cards do a good job fitting the theme.

A superhero co-op game that doesn't suffer from many of the problems of other co-op games. Each players takes on the role of a unique superhero in order to fight one of the many villains that exist in the game, in one of the many environments the game has to offer. Each deck of cards brings about its own different set of options. Players are free to help and aid in their comrades fight for a common cause, all the while doing so as they please. This game has tons of replay-ability with the expansions. Tons of superheros and tons of villains makes for endless combinations of fun.

There is no big set up for the game and the rules are quite simple.
Heroes and villains decks are well balanced, each with its own mechanics.
Environment add a bit more tension to the game but can sometimes be used to the advantage of the heroes.

The only draw back is that the game is far more easier with four players.

The theme is really present with back stories given for all characters (heroes and villains) and deck mechanics tightly fitting those.

These makes it my favorite super-hero game for now.

Graphics are not of the highest quality but they have some consistency since all cards are drawn by the same artist and the characters are often featured on other character's cards.
Also the layout of the cards and the use of the tokens give the game the look of super hero comic books from the 60s.

Card quality is really great, the internal dividers and the tokens of the enhanced edition are very useful.

Utterly amazing game. Fantastic. My favorite game for so many reasons. A cooperative card game with different decks depending on which superhero you want to be, where you're in a superhero team fighting against one of many villains in one of many environments. Rules can be a bit confusing, and some cards counteract each other, but if you're used to CCGs, you'll get the hang of this super quickly. Anyone who likes superheroes should give this game a try.

RATING: 9
I will fully admit that this game has a few flaws, but once you learn to work with it instead of fighting it, it's a lot of fun!

The most important thing you can do to make it fun is be sure to have a good facilitator sitting near the Villain/Environment. They need to be very familiar with the nuances of the rules, and willing to remember all the fiddly bits going on as the Villain tableau gets bigger and more complicated.

If no one in your group is willing to do that, then this is probably not a good game for your group.

If you DO know such a person, I promise you will love this game. Except when battling Miss Information. Then you'll want to chuck it under a bus. But only because you love it so much the rest of the time!

The best co-op game I found so far; fired Lord of the Rings: the Card Game. At first I didn't particulary like the artwork, but in the long run it is okay. The first edition suffers a bit from the lack of difficulty levels for villains/environments and heroes, but one can work around it. The variety of combos, synergies between heroes etc. is huge and makes the game really fun to play (and replay!).

Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments. Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which "play themselves", requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I currently played legendary and this game (as super hero cards games) and this one is way much better.

The good side of this game is that each character has his own deck of cards which plays differently according to their special powers. So you really have the feeling of playing a character.

The core rules are actually pretty simple: You play a card, use a card power and draw a card. It's the rules on the cards that makes it complex.

There is also a huge variety of heroes villains and environments which makes each game truly unique.

The first flaw I can see is that the balance of the game according to the characters, the number of players and the villain is fragile. At 2 players it's almost impossible to win unless you add extra characters or actions.

Certain villains would be too easy or too hard according to the number of players. So I think there seriously balancing issues. But since it's a coop game, the only thing it does is that the boss is too easy or impossible to defeat instead of beign the right challenge.

I played the game 3 times, the first 2 times worked well, but the 3rd was horrible. I switched to a character that was very complex, and the boss was also very simplex so it was very hard to know what was going on will all the powers active in the game.

Which leads me to the final part, there is a lot of bookkeeping which makes it fiddly and long to manage. They give you those extra tokens as reminder but sometimes you get so many ability bonuses and effects, that even with those, it's hard to keep track. That game would play perfectly as a video game, but as a board game it's just a bit more fiddly.

So in the end, it's not a bad game, but it won't please to all audiences.

With the changes that the second edition of SotM brings the rating finally reaches the pinnacle of gaming righteousness, a '10.' The box is now usable for the game, the even included divider cards, the card thickness matches the best the big publishers throw at their games, and the update artwork and mechanics to the base game are just icing on the cake. 

BEHOLD! SotM Greatest of ALL Superhero Games!

This game just gets better and better. I have played with numerous people, and it is always a fun thematic cooperative experience. As I have siad, I hate cooperative games, but this one is just pure magic in cardboard form. The ability to play solo, and have it still be challenging is also a huge draw.

Loving this final game from my Christmas haul. I agree it can be a little fiddly (as everyone says) but it's absolutely perfect as it is. Just need more plays! Expansions are on the top of my wishlist :)

I have all three expansions and loving the game even more! What a great game. Always down to play this one.

edit: after a lot of plays, this is dropping a little for me. Perhaps this is partly my fault: I want the game to go quicker now that I'm very familiar with it and how it works, while if there any new players the game is simply not fast playing enough for me. I'll still play but I find myself a bit more reluctant to suggest it with new players.

After a couple of digital plays (some incomplete & not recorded), this feels significantly harder than other co-ops I've played.  Losing a co-op (particularly when single player against digital AI) feels so much worse than losing against fellow humans that it really impacts my feelings towards the game.

Superhero games have often fallen flat for me, with the exception of Super Deck, which is amazing. This one had been recommended by folks and I was curious to try it, though I wasn't expecting much. Turns out I really liked the way it handled things, though I'd like the action to be a little bit more, I don't know, actiony? The fact that the heroes are bland unknowns will be a drawback to some, but is an advantage to me, as I am about 95% done with the superhero genre and that ramps up to well over 100% if you want me to care about Batman or Thor.

I was really looking forward to get this one and when I finally had it, was a bit disappointed at first. I play this usually solo and it felt dry and mechanically, preventing me to get into the theme.

A few days ago I put it out again to give it another try and what can I say? The game taught me I was wrong with my first impression, it taught me that playing SotM is awesome!! When the team smashed Grandwarlord Voss to the ground seconds before the Mars Base's self destruct sequence blow everything to pieces, I finally discovered the theme, the narrative, the fun. 

Some things may take a while, me and Sentinels did. Now I can easily say that this is a great game of superpowering fun and especially a must-pick for every comic book fan.

Game a friend at college introduced to me that I enjoy. Teamwork is the name of the game as you must work together to best the challenges the Villain decks throw at you.

My favorite game, of all time, ever, no-holds-barred. I tried this at a friend's bachelor party and was immediately smitten; I probably tweeted six or seven times over the course of two thirty-minute games how much fun I was having. The game is cooperative, but challenging enough that the input of all players is needed; and the strategy of card interactions is very deep, such that not only have I never played quite the same game twice, I've had cards that I used in entirely unforeseen ways that led to improvisational victories. The game drips with theme, with bright four-color pictures and resonant superhero archetypes, while still having its own flair. The story (and there is story, though it's implied more often than it's told) is so well-written that I look forward to every expansion just for the data, let alone the card and gameplay options. If I have to detract for a moment, I *will* say that the plain-English nature of card instructions can result in some confusing and counter-intuitive situations, but they are fairly rare and for the most part have been addressed already. Also, as a bonus, the forum community for the game on the official site is very casual, welcoming, and helpful, and the creators of the game do monitor the forum and get involved in rules discussions. There's a chance that as you read this I am already playing a game, attempting to figure out how the team of Legacy, the Wraith, and Omnitron-X can take out the rampaging Plague Rat.

RATING: 7
Fun puzzle-type cooperative game that really handles the superhero theme well. Can't decide on my opinion of the artwork. Each hero is interesting and unique in some way. Can get a bit stale though, and very fiddly with tracking buffs and debuffs from all of the cards on the table. (Supposedly an app makes that easier, but I have not used it).

This game really needs to have some iconography to make reading all the modifiers and damage less fiddly. If it weren't for all the text this game has extremely simple rules. Most effects are various modifiers or just direct damage but the heroes still feel relatively unique. I wish turns were partitioned into larger chunks because it feels like you do an almost insignificant amount each turn, but otherwise the action restrictions work pretty well, and adds some hand management planning.

It took me several plays to like this game because I was playing the base game. It IS a good game when you're using the more complex heroes (the prism person and the Survivalist are my favorites) because there isn't an obvious decision every turn like there is with the basic heroes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game is so much fun it should be outlawed.

this game is more simple than our normal fare but you really feel like a member of a team as others have said. The enormous amount of possible combinations of heroes, villans, environments and variation in cards drawn make each game unique. After 27 plays this still feels as fresh as the first couple of plays (with expansions). Everyone has their favourite heroes and everyone is always willing to play. maybe I should simply make this game my first 10...

only nitpicks for me (if I try really hard) are the amount of interactions between cards and some unclear resolutions introduced that way. This being cooperative means we can reach consensus quite easily so it really isn't that big of a deal.

RATING: 7.5
This game could get an 8 or 8.5 from me, but the normal mode is far too easy, yet the hard mode is brutal enough that it limits who I can play it effectively with.  It's boring to me to play with my more casual gaming friends at a normal level where they can enjoy it, but if I can get the right people together to play this on hard mode, I'm going to try to talk them into playing any number of other deep strategy games that I like better.  The advantage this has that does get it plays sometimes with the more core strategy group is that it's cooperative, but then if we're playing a cooperative game, we'd rather play Eldritch Horror.

Great game, but occupies a very weird and narrow space for my game group.

Received Christmas 2013. This rating will probably go up, I really like this game and enjoy the story it brings out. It makes me feel I am living a really cool comic as I play it. And as I love reading comics, this is a big plus. Excellent game.

Although I have promos and expansions, I will log all plays under this entry as I mix and match. This may change when I get Vengeance though.

Up to a 10 after 14 plays, I really do like the feel of this and can't get enough!

superficial representation of superhero combat.  not much depth as you only choose 1 card to play and 1 power to activate every turn (from your fixed deck).  Interest is tied to playing the different heroes/villains combos provided.

RATING: 9
While there are basic decisions you do have to be aware of what other characters were chosen and what villain is in play as creation of synergies is very important.

If you like superheroes, a game full of flavor and theme, and tons of replayability then I cannot recommend this more. The base set is a 9 but expansion content makes it a 10.

I enjoyed it up until I started randomizing the whole collection. Games became a grind when sub-optimal hero combination went up against certain villains.

Destroyed the fun. Randomizing heroes and villains should be fun, but then the actual gameplay more often than not wasn't this way.

I should have stuck with the core box but my OCD wouldn't allow me to do that.

Overall, too fiddly and I don't enjoy sitting for an hour or two pecking away at a 100 hit point villain.

RATING: 9
This is one of my favorite cooperative games.  You play a hero who has a custom deck with three to five other players to stop a villain in an environment.  Each deck for the heroes is different and each has its own abilities. The game is really fun and even the weaker villains can be pretty challenging.  

You do need to cooperate and share information in order to be successful.  

Every villain is different as well.  I really love this game. It is very different from other games I have played. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the best cooperative games ever made.  You have a pre-made deck for each hero that plays very differently from other heroes.  You are trying to defeat a villain in an environment.  The villain once defeated often continues to fight in a degraded state.  

The only downside is that low player counts have been much harder than 4 or 5 player counts and that some combinations of heroes are not complementary and make it nigh on impossible to win against some villains.  

Overall though, it is a great game and my favorite coop.

I have never read a comic book in my life and I still don't want to but I imagine this is exactly what a comic book feels like. Team up with other heroes and take on nasty villains. 

The only problem is the Villains and Environments should be rated somehow so you know how difficult(Grand Warlord Voss) or easy (Baron Blade) They are before hand. If you have a group of 5 or 6 heroes you may be underwhelmed if you take on a lesser villain without knowing it.

1 play so far and I can't say I'm amazed by the game.  I wanted to really like it especially after Tom Vasel gushed over how incredibly thematic this was but I was left w/ a meh feeling.  Basically on your turn you play the best card you can, hopefully it does something good, then you're done.  The villain deck does something to you and then the environment and wash, rinse, repeat.  Maybe I'm being too harsh.  I'd like to try it again and see if the feeling remains.  

UPDATE:  Traded away w/o a replay.  Had no desire to try it again.  Shame.  I really wanted to like this.

Without a doubt the best, most thematic, "We're all superheroes here to fight the bad guy" game. Each super hero has their own personality and contributes in different ways, plus the different villains and the strong influence of the environment really add to the theme. I can see how some people think calculating hits can be fiddly, but it's really just like 4-2+1, not bad. Of course, my game group is mostly engineers, so YMMV.

Excellent production value, truly captures the superhero comics in art/presentation/details/hero deck mechanics. For example, the rules are like a comics book, the speedster hero has a discard/burst deck, etc.  Downside is that there is a lot of text and the play can be slow/stifled at times.  I enjoyed it very much but a good friend of mine hated it, needs the right group/crowd that enjoys the theme and mechanics.  I think that not all heroes/decks are equally enjoyable to play, so it matters to pick the one that fits one's taste/playstyle best.

[Played twice]

The general premises are standard fare that works well, but the matches can be very inconsistent (based on how may heroes - and which ones - you have) and the bookeeping is atrocious at times.

It's simple and with good doses of randomness; decisions are few and often trivial (not much "puzzle solving" required, hence little satisfaction to be had: the game somewhat plays itself for the most part).

It is missing counters (to ease bookeeping) and better editing of card texts; overall production feels rushed (supposedly fixed by a new edition).

I want to enjoy this game more than I do. For me the characters aren't very interesting, and the gameplay feels very hand-holdy and limited (my opinion).The limit of 1 action a turn makes me feel like I'm doing next to nothing when my turn rolls around. Much of the game is working the mechanics of the villain or his henchman. Fells like a lot of stuff is happening to my character, but my character isn't doing much.

======== Skill Floor Level: 3 out of 9
======== Approachability Grade: B

You play superheroes (original ones, not Marvel/DC) teaming up to battle a supervillain. The basic gameplay is really simple, as the complexity comes from the unique card decks of each superhero, supervillain, and environment. Any combination of these decks can be used, and the supervillain/environment decks are procedurally run rather than a player acting as the villain.

This game is the best representation I've ever seen in non-videogame-form of a traditional turn-based RPG.

I initially bought this game due to the cooperative (and therefore single player) potential, and based on all of the high reviews. I find that when I play, it feels as though I am forced to take certain actions by my heroes based on what's currently happening, not really getting to choose any strategy. This enemy appears that will deal a lot of damage if we don't kill it immediately. Unfortunately, our whole team just discarded a bunch of cards so we have very few. I now have 2 cards in my hand and only 1 deals damage. Have to use the damage card.

I've been told that it comes down to which heroes you choose, how they interact, and possibly having some of the heroes in the expansions.

You really do feel like you're a superhero fighting villains in this game.  There is a ton of variety available with the different heroes, villains, and environments. 

9.1 - Jan 2015 - 23 Plays:  Well, I still love this game, and the more they add to it, the better it gets.  There are still a couple of heroes that I haven't played too many times from this set, and I haven't tried any baddies on advanced mode yet.  Very nearly a 10.

10.0 - Sept 2015 - 50 Plays:  With 50 plays under my belt and no shortage of unique situations to play through, this game is increased to a 10.

RATING: 7
This is a great game. We really wanted to love it, but it had serious problems as a two-player experience (and we mostly play just the two of us). First, it's much too difficult to win with only two players, and we didn't find that the sidekick variant helped that enough. That meant we needed to each play two characters, but the upkeep involved in playing and tracking two characters in this game was tedious. Second, if you're only playing a single character and you're KO'd, the game instantly stops being fun because you can't really do anything, but you're also not completely out of the game so you still need to stay.

Every Hero and Villain (and Environment) isn't necessarily balanced, but unlike some other games, that can actually be a good thing here.  I like logic puzzles, and there are certain Hero teams vs. Villain combos that can result in "Let's think about this a second; there has to be a way to win this...set it back up."  I enjoy that aspect of co-op games, and this one does that as good as most.

My favorite comic book themed game. This game drips with theme. The artwork is awesome, the cards are written to look like a comic book, and there's even flavor text on the cards. It's also a true co-op, which is a hit i give against Legendary. Be competitive or be co-op, but don't straddle the fence.

RATING: 7.02
I'm not sure on this one. I felt like I was spending too much time dealing with the environment versus fighting the actual villain. Thematically and in terms of difficulty it works, but in the end Baron Blade was able to crash the moon into Earth because the heroes essentially spent too much time saving hostages. So my heroes saved a few in order to lose a multitude more if not the whole planet? The environment is a nice idea, but it shouldn't take away from the heart of a superhero game.

Play #2. Yeah, still not feeling it. Book kepping seemed better, but I had a single card simply end the game. Considering I was doing well at that point, it just felt like a random stoppage.

What I like:
- Each person gets to control their own superhero
- All the choices of superheroes, villains and environment make each game different
- Rules are straightforward and easy to teach
- Gameplay is also quick

What I don't like:
- Legacy is a bit boring to play
- Need to know how to best scale the difficulty based on number of players, which superheroes you choose, and which villain you choose.
- Each superhero deck only seems to have 1 or 2 main strategies, so playing the same superhero many times could get stale.

One of my absolute favorite games of all time. As one can imagine, it gets a little clunky at times if a lot of cards are in play, but overall fun. Play time greatly depends on luck and experience of the players. Many of my friends (and myself) are pretty much always ready to play a game.

RATING: 8
The best superhero game I know of. Beats all the license games 100-0 and I say this as something of a Marvel fan. The mythos of Sentinels world is pretty generic but I don't mind, it's part of the superhero comic thing. Really, I much prefer this type of oldschool artwork, over modern style of trying to be realistic and serious - guys, you are wearing spandex. Small minus for occasional fiddliness (on the plus side, setup is very easy!) and math, but other than that this is one of my all-time favorite co-op games that has simple rules but loads of tension. Replayability of the base game is decent and by buying expansion or two (preferably in publishing order as they increase in complexity) you can create so many combinations that it becomes very replayable even for the most demanding needs. Awesome storage solution too!

2-Player Comment:
*Variant forums has AWESOME 2p variant where you play 1 hero each and rest of the heroes form a sidekick deck. It seems to be balanced way to play with two and is also pretty thematic and non-intrusive.

Good 4-colour comics fun.  Kid playable with some assistance for the youngest gamers.

"Playing blind", with little foreknowledge of the decks is considerable fun, and you find yourself reacting to events as they develop.  As you learn what the decks can do you can make longer term plans, but it's still much more tactical than strategic.

As a decade long comics geek who enjoys tactical games, this one fits squarely in my wheelhouse.

I like this game a lot. I like the theme. I like the amount of variety available to players. HOWEVER, I do not like how much work this game is to figure out exactly who gets how much damage, and when, and under what conditions. It is a pretty big mind grind each game, and I find that I spend a lot of time almost DM-ing in order to keep everything on track.

2p official variant forces players to control more than 1 hero.  Calling this game a 2p game is false advertising, IMO.  Will try the 2p variant in the forums that doesn't involve controlling more than 1 hero to see how it plays and will revise rating accordingly, but will still ding for undesirable official 2p mode.

Tried 2p with 2 heroes apiece instead, and it was much better.  Still counting off a point for forcing 2-handed play for 2p.

Modular superhero 'deck' game, where the hero, villain and environment desk are preset to give almost endless variability.

Coop deck game great with 4. The feel of the game is right on and really enhances the game. I don't love card games, but the fact that is is a super hero coop saves it. Plus, Unity is so much fun to play. The world effects also add so much to the flavor and gameplay. The cons are really the fiddliness. Each card can change what is in play. A game of all newbies would be painful. It is very easy to miss a rule on the card.

Basically the only thing I don't like about this game is the fiddliness. It pushes against my threshold of maximum fiddliness allowed. I didn't get the Vengeance expansion precisely because of that.

I put together a box of the least fiddly heroes, environments, and villains and only play with those characters. When I do this, it's fun.

RATING: N/A
At first, I thought this was the hardest co-op ever designed (harder than Ghost Stories, which I don't like) because I misunderstood the rules and was giving the villain and environment a turn after each hero turn... That's not "each  time the heroes have all had a turn" but "after each individual hero has taken their turn".

Despite all the fiddliness, this is a really good game. As I've very little opportunity to play with other people these days, it's nice to have a solo game that actually plays as if it was designed for soloing.

Against my early thoughts I love Wraith best. Others can deal more damage, but she's so adaptable, I miss her when she's not there.

A close second is Absolute Zero, though I have a love/hate thing going on there - if you don't get out the cards that give life points for cold damage, he can be gone before you know it. Last game, I didn't draw a single one before he was down. I think he was out before the end of the third turn, which is pretty quick. He's brilliant in combo with Ra, though - all that fire damage passed on! Mister Fixer rocks! Tempest is great! Haka... meh. 

Legacy is probably my least favourite. He's so vanilla-bland, much like his inspiration, Superman. Not much of a fighter, though his Galvanize power is useful.

Supposedly, Spite is a 2 villain, but Jeez, he's impossible! Easier than the super-pants Chairman!!!?? You're having a laugh. The Ennead is super-tough, too. I can beat the others, but not those two, so far.

I actually *love* the art style, and art combined with the flavor text do a wonderful job of sort of creating a new hero/ supervillain world. The game itself I would rate as just 'ok', with most game decisions being pretty obvious. I really like the fact that each hero and villain has its own deck, and no building to it. That gives each character its own personality -- Sentinels is more about personality and theme than deep gameplay, and people who can buy into that will love it.

A combo / synergy cooperative cardgame. Not to my style at all but I can see the appeal to those who enjoy both the theme (superheroes) and cooperative games. I'm fortunate to have played enough MTG that keeping track of the card effects was only a minor hassle, but even so it was stretching it at times - a load of minor effects, and even worse with the retaliation mechanisms but oh well. I'm sure that those who explore the decks and the options can find nice configurations that require strong cooperation between players, but I'm not enticed enough to try.

A refreshingly different style of cooperative game compared to the trend of the last few years. Compared to these other games the basic rules of this game are very simple, but with the interactions between cards it can suddenly become complex and difficult to keep track of. All the tokens included in this game help; it's clearly a lovingly made game.

The separate decks for each character really do give each one a distinct style of play. The whole thing is incredibly thematic. I would happily play with any group that is into the theme.

Fun game, but online solo play only so hard to judge. Still a bit too much text for A. One grudge is that there is no mechanic provided in order to allow you to adjust the difficulty of the game, which depends on environment, villain, and number/nature of heroes. But overall a good game.

This was a pretty fun game, giving a nice feel for playing inside a comic book.  Seems to be a good chance of variability between games.  Some of the intermixing card effects daunting but in general the play is extremely simple.  Does need the effect of rotating start player, though.  Acquired a copy in a math trade.  Have now played with the wife and we had a good time of it, even though we were badly beaten.  Encourages teamwork and one of the better coops.

I keep reading and rereading complaints about the game being fiddly.  I find this hogwash.  You have to place a few markers and replace them every now and again.  Big whoop.  Try playing  game with real, intense markerage like SPQR and then give me a call.  Weenies.

At no time playing this game did I ever feel I was flying, using super punches, dodging bullets, or blasting enemies. I was discarding a card, lowering HP values, reading events, and drawing cards. My choices were limited, anticlimactic, and themeless (draw a card, do 1 damage). This game needs dice, more variety, cooler choices, and far better creativity. I'd rate this game lower if it weren't for the incredibly well-done artwork. What a waste of great assets. Please, for the love of god, create a new game with this artwork, and don't let it go to waste!

It takes a few games to get the balance worked out (e.g. which heroes work well with others, and which heroes can be combined to make the game harder to win) - but the game looks great, plays well and is so thematic.

The only disappointment is the range of villains - much improved with the addition of https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/153527/sentinels-multiverse-rook-city-infernal-relics-exp .

For a co-op game, it seems a lot like solitare.  The table isn't going to read the text on all available cards and formulate a coherent strategy - everyone's pretty much going to do what they want on their turn.  And I don't like games where you have to read text on cards and try to find super-powerful combos (I think it's unappealing, not exciting, when someone can cancel out all aspects of an attack and turn it into something really great for them)

The base game is all I have at this point and it was a fun challenge.  It really evokes the moves/abilities of what you'd want from a superhero-vs-badguy game.  It's a fun cooperative rich in theme.  If I had any negatives to say, they'd be that:

1) I'm sad the expansions are getting hard to acquire
2) There has to be a better way to track the various temporal effects - the cardboard chits help but aren't sufficient
3) I'd like the box to be big enough to store my SLEEVED decks without angling the cards.
4) Some iconography on the main heros/villains would be nice to help figure out what the main role is.

[u]02/08/2013[/u]: This is a card game that takes place in a new comic book style universe created by the designers.  Two to five heroes take on a "big bad" in any number of environments.  All participants in the battle (including the environment) take a turn to play cards from their hand giving them special powers and / or actions to play against the other participants.  Each hero and villain have a certain number of starting hit points.  The heroes must defeat the villain by knocking him down to zero HP before all heroes reach zero.

Why do I love this game?  It's NOT about deck construction!  If you take a look at my comments about Lord of the Rings LCG, you'll see that I am not competent at the whole constructing decks thing.  But here, each hero has a set deck of cards to use during battle, and every hero is different.  The variety and replayability is fantastic, even with just the base set.  Add in those expansions and the combinations of heroes, villains, and environments seems endless.

There is a lot of "bookkeeping" in this game, so keep that in mind.  The Enhanced Edition comes with nice cardboard chits to help keep track of everything that is going on...and there is a lot going on in this game.  If you're playing solo, like I do, it is a bit of a chore, but the fun of the gameplay far exceeds any upkeep.

Each hero has a different feel to their play.  Each villain acts differently than the others.  All of the environments help and hurt your heroes in numerous ways.  This is an excellent addition to our hobby and one I'm glad to have in my collection.  Fantastic stuff that I'm sure will be moving up the ranks of my favorites very quickly.

I do not enjoy this. I'm not telling you you shouldn't play it, but all the game does is generate a narrative, and not a particularly interesting one. If I want to read a comic book, I'll read a comic book.

In deciding to have essentially all the rules on the cards, the designers have left open all sorts of loose ends, particularly timing questions, which exacerbate everyone's favorite feature of cooperative games, bickering. Also, while some adjustment is made depending on the number of players, it's not nearly enough, so two-player games are particularly not fun.

RATING: 6
Not a game for me, but I don't mind to play if others are enthusiastic. Remember that 1 or 2 heroes were really cool (imho) but overall this is not enough to get it (passed on a very solid offer some months ago). The upkeep for managing all the plus and minus effects and dependencies, together with the only moderately explicit rules, keep me away. (Nice if someone else does it.)

Have yet to play this non-solo because I don't want to introduce such a tedious point counting game.  Rules are not clear.  So bad I've given up on trying to know the proper way (which I have never done before).  This is not a great game, but...

Theme.  Charters.  Personality.  This is one of the absolute best in these departments!  I'm keeping the game, because of it.  If nothing else, I had to get it to quell my curiosity.  I do wish it were far less tedious and ambiguous, but the characters really bring a lot to the table.  

I'm torn as to what I think about this.  A mix of very good qualities, with qualities that make me not want to show it to others.

My absolute favourite coop game. Beautifully clearly written cards allow for some unexpected combinations and very, very rarely lead to confusion. The rules are incredibly easy to learn (play a card, use a power, draw a card, next deck) while the interaction between the heroes, the villain and the environment bring a complexity that is rarely matched in its elegance.

The base set contains somewhat easier to use heroes, a good variety of villains and some of the best environments.

This one's a hard one for me. I love superheroes, and I really do think this game nails the feel of being one. However, I think the decisions are fairly obvious when they're there at all, and it's far too fiddly to be a successful solo game for me. If any of groups liked it, I would keep it and probably bump its rating. As none of them do, I'll probably trade it.

This review covers all of the expansions unless I compose something separately thereupon. This is also being composed some ~10 months since last I played the game.

That is not coincidental. It is a very fun game, and also well-suited for teaching novice gamers how much fun a game can be which is more than Monopoly or Sorry. The art is a lot of fun; the creativity is refreshing; the fact of the Kickstarter success makes it delightful to support. The mechanics are easy and fast to pick up, and the game does have high replay value, especially when you really collect all of the various expansions and promo cards. But: it does, eventually, lose its lustre from playing over and again. Fun but too simple to truly last over time, for the avid gamer.

SOLO CAPABLE

60 Min.


Initial rating. Solo only. Fun. More fiddly than Legendary, less than LOTR LCG.

Update: Second play. Lowering rating down a point. Not sure there are enough meaningful decisions given the amount of upkeep. Definitely need to try a harder villain, or one of the easier ones on the "advanced" setting.

Update: Too much bookkeeping, even with the app. Too many cards and effects to keep track of for solo play. I could see playing this if you were only controlling one hero, instead of three, which is required for solitaire. That said, I probably wouldn't like this as a co-op. This game is just a miss for me.

Honestly, I had thought I wasn't going to like this. I mean it's co-op and really, who wants to cooperate? And the non-licensed superheros, and the simplicity.

Turns out this isn't really a co-op. It's a narrative game with a co-op element. And the theme of using fresh, new, unknown superheroes, oddly enough, makes it work!

It feels like a gang of heroes fighting off an epic threat from an insane, powerful, terrible super-villain. It's challenging, funny, intense, and manages to evoke a heroic struggle seen on the pages of the comic books. I can't wait to play it again.

For a game totally devoted to its theme,
Sentinels offers precious little narrative,
one (maybe two) uninteresting decisions each round,
and brutal down-time to chew on between turns.

If you value theme over interesting decisions,
then you may enjoy Sentinels.

I can measure games by the amount of snacking I get through. The more I snack, the worse the game. When playing Sentinels, the decision on whether to eat more Doritos (cholesterol++) is more interesting than any decision I make within the game.

Oh my god. Never again.

Is there a "Munchkin Supers"? Well, there is now, except here everyone gets their own pre-built Munchkin deck. Mindlessly draw cards and read tons of text, hoping you can dole out some damage to the Big Bad. Get smacked around by the Big Bad's totally random attacks. Strike back with your totally random assortment of cards.

Of course, I'm complaining about randomness, lack of strategy, etc., but BGGers have wisely identified this as a Thematic rather than Strategy Game. If I were into immersing myself in a comic-themed game with tons of cartoon art, spunky word balloons, and a whole superhero universe that riffs off the classics, then I would probably find this game very entertaining. But I tend to look for opportunities for strategy, planning, analysis, etc. You won't get any of that here.

I have to say I like the premisse of the game, I like the art and the thematic moves and powers of all the heroes and villains and environments... that is all fantastic...

What I didn't like is the not very clear English wording in many of the cards... many times we weren't sure of what to do or how to resolve certain effects... this was a let down.

Another thing that we didn't like that much is the fiddliness of the game... a lot of apply damage here, take damage from here, do this and that... it's easy to just forget to do something... 
Sure, we were playing with an adversary that made things even worse in that regard (The Ennead) but still...

I think this is a game that is best played in app format!

I didn't have fun playing this.  It seems overly fiddly for what it is: I hate trying to have to remember the environmental effects on top of all of the other card effects/combos etc. And if your team isn't going to be able to defeat the bad guy, you often know this long before you all die; the only problem with this is that it can take a long time for the inevitable to happen so you go through the turns slowly losing ground to the baddie until everyone is dead....which also detracts for the fun with me.

Sentinels of the Multiverse ist ein kooperatives Spiel, in dem die Spieler die Rollen von Superhelden Ã¼bernehmen. Da das Spiel keine Lizenz hat, sind die Helden allesamt Neuinterpretationen bekannter Helden. Die Spieler wÃ¤hlen sich einen der verfÃ¼gbaren Helden aus und erhalten sein ganz persÃ¶nliches Kartendeck. Als nÃ¤chstes muss ein Oberschurke ausgewÃ¤hlt werden, den es zu bezwingen gilt. Und zu guter Letzt muss noch der Schauplatz des epischen Kampfes bestimmt werden. Riesenmetropole, urzeitlicher Dschungel oder Vulkanschlund, es ist fÃ¼r Jeden etwas dabei. Sentinels of the Multiverse hat einen ordentlichen Schwierigkeitsgrad und die Spieler mÃ¼ssen sich extrem gut abstimmen. NatÃ¼rlich spielt auch die Heldenwahl eine wichtige Rolle. Manche Heldenkonstellationen sind schwieriger als andere und auch die Bosse haben unterschiedliche Schwerpunkte. Sentinels ist ein cooles kooperatives Spiel, keine Frage. Mich persÃ¶nlich stÃ¶rt etwas,dass der Zug des BÃ¶sewichten so undynamisch ablÃ¤uft und die Spieler auf sehr viel achten mÃ¼ssen. Das machen andere Spiele wie z.B. das Herr der Ringe Kartenspiel sehr viel eleganter.

Far too fiddly for what it's worth and almost impossibe to play a full game without missing one of the many modifiers.  This just zaps all the fun out of what could/should've been a great game.  There is more strategy here than its naysayers let on, though not as much as it fans claim either. I do really enjoy the artwork but only one to get if you really dig the superhero theme and are prepared for a small accounting exercise everytime you open the box. 

However i'd rate the app a 7. Removes all of the annoying tracking! Now, if they could only do this with the actual game.

I think this is a fun game for those that are into the superhero mythos.  Players can imagine themselves as powerful superheroes with unique abilities coming upon a big bad guy/girl and battling it out against the master and his/her minions.  

I, however, am not into superheroes.  So the game theme did not immerse me.  As a result, I can only assess this game on the merits of its design.

Game play is straight forward - play a card, play a power, draw a card. Score damage or healing as directed.  Hand size hovers around 4 cards, so choices are limited and typically there is one obvious card to play above all others.  Then you wait.  Wait until the other players complete their turns and the environment plays out then the minion goes.  Then repeat until you die or the villain dies.  A lot of waiting without a lot to think about during down time.  Again, if you are into the theme you can imagine the awesome things your team is doing with their superhero.  It's like a dungeon crawl, but with cards instead of maps, dice and minis.  I'd rather do a dungeon crawl myself.

The cards are poorly designed.  Text is small and iconography is not used and keywords are well hidden.  Tokens help draw out card effects in interesting ways, such as a big token announcing that all damage now dealt is +1, but this is only half innovative and half a cover for bad card design. 

Also, the art I am not into, though I imagine it will speak well to fans of comic books

Game plays out 20-30 minutes longer than I would like.  Some quarterbacking is involved.  I rate a 5.  I'll play if others all want to but would never myself recommend as an option.

Still continues to be one of the best cooperative games I've played. The number of variations in heroes, villains and environments make for a near endless amount of replay. It also has that really great feel of being your own hero and contributing your own abilities to the team.

Yes, you really have to be into the number crunching and record keeping. Before introducing new players, I ask them if they like playing TCG's like Yu-Gi-Oh or Magic to get a feel of whether they'll like it. My way to help with this is to tell everyone to summarize their turns rather than read the text. It also helps when one person (like myself) knows all the ins and outs of every card in the game so that you can summarize what's happening to players. 

In the end, once you get into the game, it's got a great feel to it, and I'll be playing this more and more with the right people, especially with the Oblivaeon expansion coming soon.

Very entertaining and thematic, but also a bear to manage with multiple status modifiers in play at one time as well as cards that resolve to draw more cards and other effects that cause bookkeeping to be a problem. Fun enough to be worth the 'work', but the effort keeps this from hitting the table as often as it otherwise would.

Also, game experience can vary wildly based on the combination of decks used (both natural counters and hopeless situations are a real possibility if setup is random).

Update: After further play, the book keeping really does become more tedious, but the experience is still worth it.

My least favorite of all the deck building games of this style. 

You don't actually deck build (they are set from the beginning) and resolving each round takes a LOT longer than it should for a game of this time due to rolling dice and resolving symbols based off the types on each enemy who are visible. The game plays one person's actions at a time in a round, but you never feel like you can do much. Your restricted to playing two cards a turn (except in special circumstances which gets annoying.

This game, a good 2 years after purchase, is still being played weekly by my husbands group.  Yes, we have almost every expansion (OblivAeon awaiting Kickstarter fulfillment), as well as all published fanmade decks in card sleeves (links forest is hard.)  Its easy to learn/play but you have to use tactics across the table to succeed in this cooperative game.  Legacy wont know to buff you unless you ask him......I enjoy the comic book world that this us set inandhave no idea why the associated comics didnt have the demand to be printed, I'd love more story behind these!  How the Baron went frombad to good guy....how Giganta came by her powers....what happens to the great Ra?  Each deck is flavorful and unique while maintaining balance across the game.  My husbands group tries a scenario (from the online game achievements....) with their "B team".  If they fail, then they bring their "A game" and are almost unstopable.

Lots of replay value, cheap as card builders go (Pokemon?) and a very flavorful game.

Only 1 play, but first impressions count for a lot.  Some notes:
1) A super hero game must have heroes I'm familiar with to keep me interested.
2) Too much to keep track of on all the villain cards that come out.  Too complex.
3) Prefer Legendary: Marvel Deck Building Game.

Love this game. The characters are all extremely thematic and their decks are great fun to play. Very Expandable, and the artwork is just so great. I prefer this over Legendary, but the games can at times be a bit too long (some of the enemies have wayyyy too many hit points) and the attritional nature means this fun card game can over stay it's welcome every once in a while.

A neat little card game, however, there is too much to keep track of and the games tend get chaotic thusly. I fell prey to the hype and was badly disappointed. Oh and BTW: the artwork sucks and doesn't resemble comic books at all, it's more in line with saturday morning cartoons like Batman The Animated Series, which is somewhat of a thematic error for a genre-emulator like Sentinels.

Update: Played it recently and with a different character it was actually quite fun. Still too chaotic, but that comes with the exception design, I guess.

RATING: 9
An excellent cooperative game. You wouldn't think a game based around a completely made-up universe of superheroes would work that well, but it really does. Every time I play this, it feels like a big boss battle in Final Fantasy. Everyone uses their actions in turn, and sometimes the environment reacts to what goes on in the fight, or vice versa. There is also a ton of underlying depth to this one that isn't apparent until after several plays. One of the best superhero games on the market for sure.

I actually managed to finally get in a game of Sentinels of the Multiverse last night!
A mate invited me round to his house last night to introduce me to a couple of his gamer mates (theyâre more into wargames and role-playing than board games I think) primarily to show them 1066.  And since my new decks arrived we had two games going at once, which was great.  They had some interesting feedback, some very useful, some a bit whacky and game-changing, but they all said they enjoyed it and would play again.
One had to leave early so with three of us left we broke out Sentinels, which Iâd spied upon walking in and hoped to crack open.
Really enjoyed it!  Very interesting design, I really like how each of the hero and villain decks are unique and I especially like the environment cards that introduce new events.  There was a fair bit of book-keeping, but no more than Arkham Horror for example.  We played against Omnitron the Sentient computer, Ross was Haka the ethnic Hulk dude, Al was Ra the Sun God, and I got Legacy, who I thought was a Superman type character from the pics, but who actually turned out to be a passive support type almost Cleric/Healer character.  Since thatâs a role I donât usually play it was a little bit duller for me than it could have been I think, but actually with the buffs I was giving the other guys I was vicariously inflicting as much damage as either of them each round.  I had one Ongoing card which actually attacked but it got cancelled right quick by the baddieâs special ability.
We took a bit of a beating and the wounds were stacking up, but we stayed on top of every event and droid that came out and stacked any leftover damage onto Omnicron, eventually leading to his defeat.  Quite tense, very enjoyable.  Wish the DC game was like this!  Still not sure if Iâd pick it up though, since we have the super hero theme covered.  And as much as I admire their all new hero designs, theyâre so obviously rip offs of other mainstream heroes it just lets it down a bit.
Also discovered weâd been playing it slightly wrong after the fact, by not flipping over the villainâs ability card every turn, but using both sides at the same time, which made it more difficult!  But we werenât playing the advanced ability either (not sure if that would have had too much of an impact though: +1 damage one turn, -1 the next or something similar).

This is clearly a well-designed and tested game.  And I sort-of enjoy it.  But something isn't quite clicking in it for me; it feels like it's trying too hard to be thematic, at the expense of the player who ends up spending a lot of time tracking modifiers.  And knowing how all the cards interact and how all the characters, bad guys and locations interact really help, which means a big learning curve to get full enjoyment.

And it's hard! (which isn't a bad thing)

Just not enough engaging gameplay to keep me interested. Maybe if I'd found ANYONE willing to play it too, I'd feel differently, but the fact no one wanted to play it does kind of speak for itself.

RATING: 6.5
It took me a long time to come around and try this game.  After my first play I have to say this is a game I enjoy and will look forward to playing it again.  The characters all feel like copies of existing super heroes from the formal comic book universe, but stand enough on their own to keep the theme.  Legendary Marvel still is my go to superhero game walking away, but this game is different enough to help it get to the table.

Great little game. Hope to get the expansion soon. Very thematic and definately the best of the genre. 

After 3 solo games though, I have the following suggestions -

The following should still be bolded/italic/symblised on the cards:

Start of  Turn:
During  Turn:
End of  Turn:
Reduce  damage
Add  to damage


And then theres the book keeping issue, but dice or similar could fix this.

2-player game with 2 heros each. Very fun, but Absolute Zero is a bit hard to calculate.

Maintenance every turn, basic maximization of character effects, sometimes one-sided enemy with no chance of victory, and a form of player elimination where you're dead and helping very marginally make me dislike this game in a few areas.

I still love the theme, thinks superheroes are awesome, and I like the variety, but I wish those aspects I said above could be improved. I also think the base game could've come with more stuff, but I always think games should come with more things :P

Very fun coop game with high replayability due to the modular nature of the game. Each deck uses unique mechanics making every game very different. The adjustable difficulty level can make the game quite challenging. Quick game to teach and works great with kids. Fun for a low-stress evening. After a few plays, better with expansions for greater variation and replayability.

I enjoy it equally with 1-5 players, though I just use the video game version for 1 player games.

Great game with lot's of replayability, lot's of theme and an incredible simple system. It's very easy to explain and with lot's of interaction between the players. For me one of the best cooperative games.

Edit 29/10/2012: bumped my 9 rating to a 10, whenever I had time this last month I picked up this game. 
This game is surprisingly deep, the first times I played it I only focused in each player deck, the game felt simple and contained. Now I can see that many decks interact with other heroes decks, expanding possibilities for each hero. Every game unravels new power combinations and new strategies, and with each layer I find the game keeps getting better. 
And the best thing is that it is an incredible Solo game!
I'm now anxious to incorporate both expansions, they're already bought for Christmas!

The co-op element is handled nice and simply in this one with each player having their own hand of cards just like in LotR. But... it's just... there is nothing to do in this game! I mean, picking the best possible card from a hand of four isn't such a big deal (pun intended) and the game feels way too long when that is the only thing you do for an hour and a half.

Amazing game if you like superheros and co-op card games. Each of the heroes play differently enough and the bosses are also different enough where I don't see myself getting bored any time soon. Love the back stories and I can't wait to get the other expansions.

Only bad thing about the game is the amount of math and paying attention to all the card modifiers (not hard, just time consuming).

I played (solo) this one while being hyped and in love with the Pathfinder ACG so my opinion on this might change a bit later.
I purchased this one looking for a good solo experience but I feel that this game really shines when played with more people.  

Pros: The superheroes' theme and the characters (there are a lot). The price is not that much as other similar games, and the components are good (*enhanced edition). 

Might like or dislike: There's a lot going on on this game for that simple rules that it has. It's all about cards and you have in a game all your hero's card (not a deck builder). The art could be improved but it fits well in the game. The replayability depends on the varied combinations of heroes vs villains and environment.

Cons: You have to keep track on HP counters, damage dealt/taken modifiers, etc... The cards modify the rules so you have to keep that in mind too (it does not have a too steep learning curve but the game demand you to "drive" it so you might not enjoy it that much on the firsts plays -especially if playing solo-).  

You can't change stats or level up your heroes while playing a campaign (what I enjoy most on Pathfinder), but that can be easily mended.

The reason that I mention Pathfinder ACG when I explain Sentinels is because I came to Sentinels [...] after some people recommended it to me for I like PACG that much.

Really thought I enjoyed this game when it first released.  During my 25+ plays other games were released that does what SotM is trying to do much better (namely Pathfinder -  TACG).  By comparison to other games I enjoy SotM is just too fiddly and plays become a challenge in book keeping...  The overall effort washed out the unique and creative theme by a landslide.

Also numerous sessions via iOS application on iPad/iPhone.  The app version is just as annoying and empty as the cardboard version - so even the automation of the fiddly bits can't improve the mechanics.

A co-op game where each player picks a hero to fight against the villain whom will face all heroes in the current game.  During my play I chose a hero that had LOTS of weapons, I remember the best one he had made me charge it for a round or two, and that was it, which was boring.  Also, there seemed to be TONS of things to remember and upkeep between rounds.  The heroes were not a big deal, but the villain we were facing had things we had to do every turn which REALLY dragged the game down a bit.  

Despite all of this the game IS fun, but I do not want to own the print copy, think I will REALLY enjoy this on iOS if that happens in the coming future.

Ameritrash-style CCG and coop are two of my least favorite but I didn't hate this game. It moved quickly, came gorgeously organized and seems to have a lot of replay value. It's probably a huge winner if you enjoy the genre; in the event I found it just OK. I don't think I'd want to play it again unless the other choices were Elder Sign and Pandemic. The heroes demolished the villains, so I wonder if it's always this easy or if we just chose an unbalanced combination.

Just meh. The theme is cool; I mean, what's not to like about fighting a super villain with some friends? The game itself, though? I just don't find it very fun. The cards all do similar things and the game is just incredibly simple. There's a lot of text on each card, but the mechanics of the game seem very one-dimensional and boring to me. I could see this game being fun for the first few runs for someone who likes collaborative games, but I don't see how people could enjoy playing it repeatedly. Maybe I'm completely off the mark, though, as it seems people really enjoy the game.

A bizarre and wonderful co-op game where determining the team is half the battle.  The artwork is right on the line between cheesy and perfect, the gameplay matches the feel of the artwork, and the heroes and villains are all well-realized creations in and of themselves.

Not a fan of co-ops because of the "you do this" alpha leader?  Sentinels solves this problem.  Get on it.

I really enjoy this game, even though I typically lose :) Love the theme and the sequence of play is easy to get into and follow.  It can be unbalanced in terms of how different heroes play and how they interact with villains.  It also doesn't scale down to less than 3 heroes.  But for me, part of the strategy is playing different combos of heroes against different villains and seeing who works and who doesn't.  So I don't mind it too much.  But once I find a group that works, the tension and strategy can really come together.

Fun. My only complaints are the amount of bookkeeping required. The villains have a lot of text and effects on a tiny card and there are so many modifiers going on sometimes that it is hard to keep a picture of the game state in Your head. This gets MUCH worse on villains that have a lot of unique minions. Also, I think that player downtime is a minor concern as well as sometimes you may not have much to do on a turn or skip to draw cards and it can be awhile before it gets back to you. The game is really fun despite these complaints and we enjoy it.  The various hero decks and the way they interact is very cool.

Simple cooperative game, easy to teach.

The theme is great, each hero feels different and you can feel the spirit of the comic books while playing.

It is not well escalated. It's insanely difficult with 2 players.

The language barrier is high; cards have different effects and 99% of it is described with text.

The Enhanced 2nd Edition includes tokens to count life, and a nice box with speaces to place the cards in order, two things that were sorely missing in the first edition.

Played once, then played the introductory app and vowed never to play the card game again. Too much work keeping track of all the ongoing effects and hp with too little reward. Cooperative games must have an enduring and engaging story line for me to want to play them. This doesn't have it. It is just a battle once and be done kind of game. Much rather play the app for such a game if it is so tactical-focused.

I like this game.  HOWEVER, I don't think I'll ever play a physical game.  It is extremely fiddly in terms of figuring out exactly what you can and can't do on a turn.  "This card played by X allows you to have +1, but this card played by Y gives you -2, but if this card is in play, you put +2 back and the original card is 3.  But then there's defense with all the same kinds of things going on."  So I play on a device that does all the math for me and I'm much happier.

100+ plays. It just seems to come out regularly all year, every year.  It's a light romp co-op, another of those "let's see what happens" games (which you're either fine with, or not, so the gameâs not for everyone). Each player gets a pre-made deck, and out comes a boss villain, a baddies deck, and a pack of environment cards to fight against. On your turn, you're trying to inflict as much damage on the baddies as you can - you win if you kill the boss - and after everyone's had a shot, baddie cards get flipped and enacted, usually inflicting damage back on you. Win before you all die. There are two main issues with the game. Firstly your turn is very straight forward - pick your best card and play it, and then pick your best power and use it. Maybe you'll hold back if your best card might be even better later, so play something else instead. But most decisions are things like inflict 1 damage to everything or inflict 3 damage to one thing. Not that hard. Secondly, there's little tension in the game because there aren't risk/reward tradeoffs to be made. It's not like you're weighing up actions and cards based on the odds of whether something will happen or not - you just weigh in and play what you've got. So the gameplay itself isn't that interesting, but it plays fast and works because it's fun to get your combos out and live and die together as a team, making it a positive social experience with a great theme that I'm always happy to play. The huge number of combinations of player decks vs villains vs environments makes for a ton of different situations to overcome together, so while the gameâs simplicity means itâs not for everyone, for us itâs one of those games where the social environment it generates overcomes any mechanical downsides.

Fun Comic Book Themed Coop Card Game. Heroes work together to tackle a villain and environmental catastrophes/calamities. Each hero and villain plays differently from others. Good feel to the game. 

Family Game !! Beer-N-Pretzels Game !!

This and Hanabi might be my favorite Coops yet, me thinks. I haven't yet determined for myself if the game plays you, but in the mean time, I'm enjoying it.

RATING: 7
What I like:
- Pure co-op with creative theme
- Asymmetric characters have distinct personalities

What I don't like:
- 2p game with 4 heroes against Spite took 130 minutes (later games were 45-60)
- Too many special abilities to track and remember
- With 2p against most villains each player must control 2 heroes

It's clearly not my style of game, but I can look at it objectively and see its merits. Definitely choose your heroes and villains as a combination, so you know what you are getting into. With a bad combination, I would rate the game a 4. With a great combination, it's a 7.

I would put the complexity around 2.8 and the depth around 2.0 for a weight of 2.4, which is a bit higher than BGG voters are saying.

RATING: 1
What a major disappointment, especially after the Joyous experience of buying galaxy trucker a week before for $5. Never again will I look at the top 100 on bgg as trustworthy and get swayed by IOS blog hype. 

Banal, soulless, characterless, repetitive, no decision making, interminably long card play with fourth tier watered down 'heroes' that wouldn't have come out of Stan Lee's mind if he was hallucinating with a raging flu on a 2 hour deadline. If I had fond childhood memories of Legacy and RA, maybe I would appreciate this more, but who cares about boring generic characters that you never even read as a child? Or are there adults who actually think these generic and clichÃ©d heroes are cool? That's pretty sad.  

There isn't even an AI to keep you company. The evil deck just doles out random cards. Felt so terribly alone. 

Absolutely the worst card game I ever purchased on IOS. Extremely overpriced at $10. Yomi cost the same but that at least finishes a game in five minutes, not an hour! Deleted after four games. Freed up 1.5 gigs of space! Best feeling I ever got out of this 'game'. 

I read reports that the actual game is like accounting. Wow. The IOS version removes the accounting and it still sucks. 

Even leaping lemmings stayed on my ipad longer than "sentinels of the boringverse"

I've been looking for a good comic book super hero game for a long time and this one does it for me. Being a co-op is a bonus as I am a fan of those as well. 

The bosses can be extremely difficult to beat in this game, depending on what super heroes are going up against them. The part I like the most is the bosses typically have "minions" which come out each turn and must be defeated in addition to the boss, also the environment cards can play havoc on the team. 

The downside I see with this game is it could potentially be quite difficult for 1 to 3 players to win. I have only played 4 player games and have barely won.

This is truly a gem, a great "marriage" of gameplay and theme! The replay factor is huge, with all the heroes x villains x enviroments. All decks feel very different from one another and the game is a blast to play, plus it's very easy to teach, but not an easy game to master!

I've no doubts that this is the best board/card game about super heroes.

Just to poke at something, the art could be a lot better, the visuals feels like cheap comics.

* This review is about the Enhanced Edition of the game!

** So far i've been only playing it solo, using 3 to 5 heroes, and i'm pretty sure playing it multiplayer won't change my score, if anything i'll want to rank it higher!

*** I actually played the game with more people and found it to be less interesting, so yeah, i don't want to rank it higher.

RATING: 6
This cooperative card game evokes the feeling of a CCG like Magic--you put out your character, buff him up with equipment and effects, and use those along with one-use cards to inflict damage on a villain and his minions (also cards, of course).  The game uses combinatorics to keep the game fresh and variable--there are many different hero, villain, and environment decks that can be used in combination for a game.  The villain and environment decks are controlled by game rules, not players.  I'd say this game is a must-play for comic-lovers who like cooperative play.  I'm neither, but still enjoyed this.

So this game has a lot going for it. The characters and villains are unique. The decks are your own so there isn't much for quarterbacking. The locations can add some interesting twists. I also like that these are "fictitious" characters so I don't have to know the background of them. It made it more enjoyable for me as I rarely know anything about comics. 

But when it all boils down to the gameplay, it feels lacking. I really don't feel like I can combo much and most of my hand played itself. You do make some decisions, but I felt like most are pretty obvious in choice. Still, even so, the cooperative nature of the game can lead to some excitement and "hold on, I'll play this" type of moments.

A lot of modifiers can get tossed around and become confusing and some of the wording on cards is less than ideal. Not to mention that a lot of the cards are incredibly wordy. Symbols would have gone a long way, but not sure how much you could really reduce down the text with how verbose and detailed a lot of the cards are.

This is one of the rare games that gets better on the app for me. I very often don't like playing board games on the phone/computer, but this simply takes care of the modifiers and tidies up the game space in a unique and fun environment. It's surprisingly well done.

Makes it to the table quite routinely. Our group has kept up with the expansions, and we have enjoyed this game a lot. Good fixed deck mechanics, relatively tight balance on some combinations, others get pretty swingy based on draws sometimes but that's definitely what keeps it fun.

I loved the variety of the heroes, villains, and environments.  I liked the hidden aspect of playing your own cards and not have the alpha player concern.  It was definitely a lot of fun feeling like a superhero.

The game had a lot of stacking abilities and chits.  There was a lot of overhead to be mindful when playing the game.  It can be VERY fiddly in this regard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Awesome game!  The superhero theme shines through for me.  The heroes all feel very different, and it's easy to picture the epic battle raging.  One of the plays turned into a two hour slugfest, where we were fighting to stay alive, and could never come together to effectively hurt the villain.  That was too long.  It became boring even though it ended up being close (Omnitron killed our last hero the turn before she would have been able to deal the Coup de Grace to that twisted robot).

Simple fun for short time but, it lacks longevity. Shares similarities to the lord of the rings card game and some others. Doesn't have the same amount of depth as those games. Probably will lower rating to 7 in future.

The game does carry it's theme well though. Enjoying the theme helps with this game. 

Sold this because I felt it overlapped other choices in my collection but more so because I was considering upgrading to the ultimate edition. Unfortunately it sold out before I could get it. Lucky me. Hopefully there will be a re-print.

desiring to play this again. Think I made a mistake selling it previously.

edit: re-purchased it as the enhanced edition along with the enhanced rook city/infernal relics combo pack and shattered timelines. We'll see if I like it better this time around.

Edit: A bit better this time around, but still a little dull in the game play. More combos and options being available would help. 

The game is a little bit restrictive and can become tedious with certain setups. However if you are looking for an easy to learn and play thematic game then this isn't too bad. Night Mist is probably the most interesting hero of the bunch to play.

Sentinels is a good co-op game that nails the superhero theme. It tells stories that are outlandish, funny, and sometime genuinely awesome. However, downtime can be a factor. If players are ready when their turn comes around, then the game improves remarkably. If you end up liking the game, there is a lot of it out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I've only played this a couple of times, but I was expecting more from this. The designers could learn a lesson from Race for the Galaxy and use some simple iconography to indicate where in the turn each card has its effect. Most of the game time seems to be spend re-reading cards or trying to remember what modifiers are in play. And I've never been much of a superhero fan, so the theme doesn't patch over these problems for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A great father son game but not for a mixed crowd, Sentinels provides a new type of cooperative experience. One of the biggest issues with the game is the massive in-game text with some cards having 7 sentences needing deciphered to continue play. The developers would do well to create a symbol system for the cards to quickly designate damage type and its calculation as many cards are repetitious of the same type of game interaction, the Environments being particularly susceptible to this problem. The game also has the annoying, "if you don't stop this one card, the game ends" cards as well which just take away the fun of a game. I'm not too fond currently of the game.

I soooo desperately wanted to love this game.  I loved how each hero had their own deck and their own flare to the game.  I loved how each villain had their own deck and flare to the game.  I loved how you could introduce environments which effected every hero and villain in play...  And then the mass amount of MATH begun.  Not even halfway through Sentinels it stops being a game and starts being a complicated algebraic equation. The heroes themselves are horribly lopsided in strength and the environments turn into an iron man event of organization that you begin to beg for it to stop long before it does.  A real shame.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A vast comic book universe with an incredible wealth of backstory, Sentinels of the Multiverse has a lot to dig into.  The play mechanics are incredibly simple: play a card, use a power, draw a card.  The challenge varies wildly depending on party composition, villain and environment deck.  A lot of variables to consider.  

The only true downside to this game is the sheer amount of bookkeeping.  This is mentioned elsewhere countless times, but the amount of information you need to track and remember each round is staggering.  For this reason, I can't even play the digital app.  I need to be able to see all cards and their text at all times in order to plan my turns.  I really enjoy playing this, but it's easy to burn out with the amount of effort involved.

I really enjoy this game.  However, there are some balance issues and the rule book could be clearer.  I have the enhanced edition and even with that rule book things could have been clearer.  Also, there's a steep curve between the bad guys and the good guys.  But once I learned how everything worked, we were able to win every time.  Edit: Just played a 4 player game with all of the expansions.  It was tough, really REALLY tough and I noticed we were playing something wrong but didn't say anything because there were 2 new people.  When you are learning, stay with Baron Blade because learning how to fight the villian, learning your cards, and the environment can be rough.  But, I still love it and am upping from an 8 to an 8.75.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A mixed bag for solo play. The game can feel like trying to juggle abacuses while counting backwards from negative infinity and singing 99 bottles of beer on the wall. There's so much to keep track of, so many card effects all happening at once and each with different rules or exceptions. It looks simple, but it can be a chore.

In solo play, however, it's even worse because not only is there no one else to help you remember this stuff, but you have to play more than one hero at a time. Even in multiplayer, I don't feel the game is very well balanced for the number of heroes. If I could play one hero against the villians, I'd play this more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A great, highly thematic cooperative game.  Lots of fun, lots of variety from game to game.  My biggest gripes are that the game is 1) Rather fiddly, there's a lot of moving pieces to keep track of at any given point, and 2) Balanced for 4 heroes.  Even with the H mechanic that the Enhanced Edition brings, it's clear that the game was designed for 4 heroes, no more, no less.

Multi-player cooperative game. Think of Magic: The Gathering where everyone has a deck, and then everyone attacks a villain, who also has a deck in an environment, which also has a deck.

I played just one match, but I must say it felt a little too easy. More experienced players argued that it was due to the group sinergy. I have to play a few more times to make sure.

Theme wise, this game represents everything I don't like about the comics world, so It didn't really work for me at all. The art was really poor. Mechanically, it plays sort of like Legendary if you took everything interesting about Legendary out. Players have these pre-built decks, and then you encounter a villain deck plus location deck, and you win or lose depending on what cards you get when and which heroes you wanted to play. I found this to be pretty dull, without any interesting choices to make.

Would be a ten if there weren't promo cards that simply cannot be had unless you supported the KS or buy them off of ebay.  I hate that crap.  

Update: Was quite novel, at first...then...it just kept growing and growing.  Now, it is more of a pain to play than it should be.  There's something like forty characters to play, and three or four versions of every character...I've just lost my taste for it.  Very clever idea, but greed got the best of the publishers, imho.  Dropped a point and a half.

RATING: 7.4
Solid co-op with a good amount of variety, especially once you have some expansions.

Sometimes the "AI" can be extremely annoying. Depending on your party's configuration, it's possible you'll have a player that basically becomes a 1-trick-pony against some bosses, where every turn is identical.

RATING: 8
A co-op hero game in which you control a hero and your team must defeat the chosen villain. There are a TON of heroes to choose from, and each hero is loosely based on comic/TV/movie superheroes (Absolute Zero = Iron Man). Each hero has their own back story and also plays differently with their own mechanics. The game can be a challenging game, depending on what heroes are in your team, and who the villain is.

RATING: 9.6
One of my boy's favorite games. The theme and art are really great. It is pretty fiddly, but an app to help track hit points helps and as long as one player is sort of "in charge" of making sure all the villain/environment stuff triggers then it works pretty well. The theme is what really makes this game for me. If I had to judge it on the mechanics alone, it would probably only be a 6.

RATING: 9
An instant hit when I got this game. Had watched a play through two years previously and felt quite sure it wasn't for me. Two years later I watched the same play through and right away ordered the game. And I'm having a blast. There are so many options, so many set-ups, great fun. And personally I like the art quite a bit. And yes, it is a bit fiddly, but mostly ok.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Probably the most thematic superhero game I've played. Certainly more thematic than Legendary or Dice Masters.

I like the differentiation of the characters and how you build your tableau over the course of the game to gain power. I don't like how some villains take away your tableau and make you feel like you just lost all the progress you'd made up to that point. There is a fair amount of book-keeping involved as well.

Own this in digital form. (iOS)
Great app implementation, tons of hours spent playing the app in addition to the logged physical plays.

Not a perfect game, tracking of all in game effects can be daunting, but my god does my group love this game. It is by far & away the most played game in my collection, it hits the table consistently, pretty much weekly, often back to back & it is always met with welcome arms. The theme is perfect for us, the replayability is through the roof, & just the sheer fun factor of downing an enemy after all seemed so bleak but a few turns ago really gives that overcoming all odds comic book feel! 

Highly recommend this to anyone who likes: 

TEAMWORK in their co-op (oppose to the alpha gamer dictating everyone's turns based on the current board state.) 

COMIC BOOKS from the amazing (& constantly improving) artwork of Rebottaro, to the quotes referencing comic issues that do not exist, but inject oh so much flavor into the game, this game really is what it would be like to play out an issue of a comic. 

SUPERHEROES I have more of an attachment to the characters in this game than I do to any character that I grew up reading issues of, or watching TV shows of, or playing with their action figures, or even still now as an adult enjoying their resurgence into amazingly well done movies.

The guys who make this game are all amazingly cool & I definitely suggest you track them down at a convention (of which they attend many) & say hello. You won't be disappointed.


I can't say enough good things about this game, it would be the one game out of my (extensive) collection that I would save from a fire if I only had time to save one. Give it a try.

Didn't think much of this one, the play didn't appeal to me. The sense of theme is there but it didn't seem to be followed up.
The objective of the play seems to be to get the right combination of powers and actions so you can inflict a lot of damage each go round. 
However I found the plethora of action cards to be tiresome to track.

I do not like or enjoy Sentinels of the Multiverse. I will play it as I don't hate it and others enjoy it, but it's not for me. The entire game just feels like a giant text reading fest to see what happens with almost no ability to strategize or make meaningful decisions. I just feel like I'm reading a rulebook on every card and slowly assigning damage until I win or lose. Don't get the appeal of this one.

Definitely my favorite purchase of 2013, so far, and a title that I plan to buy any and all expansions for.

Usually I am not a fan of "take that" type deck games but this one just won me over.

Sentinels is a fast paced and challenging co-op, with a theme that is beautifully executed and completely woven into every aspect of the design. This succeeds in feeling like an epic battle between villains and heroes and not simply a puzzle that needs solving.

You can teach the game to a table of new players and have it up in running in less than 10 minutes.

The Enhanced Edition box is an absolute statement on how well thought out and lovingly crafted a game can be. You can just feel that the designers had the entire experience in mind, from set-up to break down.

The cards are a blast to look at, the game plays tense and bitter, with most coming right down to a dramatic climax. 

This is the first game I've owned that I actually feel like I have to tear myself away from in order to learn/play other things.

[b]**UPDATE** 8/14/13[/b]
After some weeks and several plays the fiddliness of this one really started to wear on me. I found the prospect of setting it up and soloing through a 3-character battle was becoming just a little bit more than I was excited to put myself through.

The theme started to fade behind the mechanics and the rinse-repeat feeling of most turns, and many games (solo & multi-player) started to feel like they were probably taking longer than they needed to for what the game is trying to do.

I remain impressed with the design, and the utter replayability offered, but sadly the overall shine to this one simply wore off through time.

[b]**UPDATE 8/26/2014**[/b]
This has now completely lost it's shine for me. I can't even make it through a solo game anymore. It's almost crazy to think just last year I felt as impressed with this as I was. I really think I might have just been blinded by how cool Expatriate was, those two hand guns just blasting away..

I've really enjoyed this game. It's very simple to teach to new players, and it's very quick to set up and get right into playing for players familiar with the game.

Pros:
1. Options. There are a ton of options on what heroes you can play, villians you can fight, and locations you can fight them. You will not run out of new set ups.

Cons:
1. Fiddly. There are so many things to keep track of in this game it's out of hand. They created an app to help with the tracking, but that's almost as big of a pain to use. We spent between 10% to 20% of the time just changing the villian's track.
2. Simple. Perhaps we played with very straight forward heroes, but the cards were like punch for 2 damage, use shield to take no damage. It was boring.
3. Participation. There's always one player who's job is to just sit there and take all the damage the villian throws out. How exciting for that player right? Just sitting there getting crushed.

Summary: This game was just not exciting to me. It was a pain to set up, a pain to track everything, and didn't have a ton of excitement. I could think of no reason to want to play this game. There's nothing inherently wrong with this game. It works. I'd say it's a snoozefest, but there's never any time to nap because you're constantly updated the villian's statistics. This game feels like busy work.

The primary requirement for a game to be considered a game is that it requires player input and decision making.  SotM only barely passes that benchmark.
Like Arkham Horror or Tales of the Arabian Knights before it, Sentinels is a game that essentially plays itself; restricting the job of the player to just pushing chits around according to the instruction of random card draw.

Seems like a fun game, eminently customizable.

Given to us as a gift. An OK concept, but I feel like Smash Up executes on the same sort of idea a little more cleanly.

I really enjoy this game a lot, from the cooperative gameplay to the sometimes crushing difficulty to the superhero theme. The expansions all add a lot and it's got a lot of replayability as you can mix combinations of heroes, villains, and environments, plus the random nature involved in each of those categories. The expansions are all great so far. My only complaint is that you really have to pay attention during the late game, as there will usually be many cards with ongoing effects and various triggers which you have to keep track of. Despite that, it's still a fantastic game in my opinion and I've never found myself not enjoying playing it.

I love this game. it's almost like DnD with superheroes. (or atleast, thats what i tell people to try and convince them to play with me!) It's a bit complicated to pick up, and the scenarios are limited if you play with under 3 characters. There are plenty of interesting heroes to choose from, and powers to play. a fun strategy game great for anybody who likes superheroes, cooperating with others, and a little bit of a challange.

I must say, the first time I played Sentinels of the Multiverse I didn't care for it much. I found the art to a real turn-off and there was way too much bookkeeping involved in the way damage was dealt, even with the enhanced edition tokens.
That being said, this game gets better every time I play. There's so many interesting combinations of characters and villains that change the experience drastically. The bookkeeping also gets easier as you get more familiar with the villain and environment cards, though it still pays to have someone with good memory.
Sentinels really shines when you finally find that one villain who gives you a good beating and then returning for payback.
Overall: Sentinels can appear a bit rough around the edges. The rulebook is pretty vague and doesn't do any favors for new players. This is really a game about discovering things for yourself. If you're up for that, you're going to have a great time.

Fun game, but lots of reading.  We got this for Christmas 2013.  We've played it twice so far.  The first time, Baron Blade pulled the moon into the earth and we lost, the 2nd time we beat the robot factory guy.

It's a little fiddly, but I don't see a way to maintain all those powers from the characters without having it be fiddly (other than play an online implementation).  It's a co-op, so you're helping each other keep track of all the special benefits that are in play.

Good game.  Recommended.

Want more variety than just adding or removing heroes?  Get the app and tell the game how many heroes you want to play with and how difficult you want it to be.  Voila.

There is a lot to keep track of when playing this game, which makes it very involved.  I like that.

My second play was marred by the fact that we played with six players, which was entirely too many. It seems like people only got 2-3 turns before the villain died. I want to like this game, but I think I need to play with the right number of players. I have only played with 2 or 6. So I don't think I've played this game at the sweet spot.

I suspect my issues with the game would continue even with a different player count: not enough depth to have meaningful decisions but too fiddly to be a light card game.

Preconstructed decks for each hero?  An optimal strategy that you should be using for the character you chose?  Combos that exist by virtue of the deck you've got, rather than by virtue of your having put them into the deck?  This game takes all of the creativity out of CCGs and leaves just the bare mechanics.  The comic book theme was nice, but certainly not enough.

So far the first game was good.  I thought this was going to be a mess to set up and put away like Legacy, but it was relatively easy.  Pay attention to the character levels.  We grabbed a level 3 villain for our first game and got our butt kicked. 

It's a little difficult when a lot of characters come out on the field and paying attention to what happens at each stage.  You're doing a lot of card reading to see what each one does.

Other than that, it was fun and I can't wait to try it with more than two to see how that plays out.

Probably one of the least interesting games I've played. A textbook example of why games with a single heuristic are bad. There's one thing you're supposed to do ("moar damugeh!") and a very simple turn structure in which to do it, making your actions predictable and straightforward. Absolutely zero relevant choices to be made. The "challenge" of the game is a product solely of the randomization and combination of villain + environment + heroes selected, and has zero to do with your choices as a player. Also, extremely fiddly. Seriously cannot understand the hype.

I wasn't very impressed with this game. It is a co-operative but doesn't add anything new to the genre. The flavour is light with slightly mocking silver age style comic book heros and villains but the gameplay is just a series of trying to maximise various combinations of cards from your deck. It tends towards a fairly tedious number crunching and analysis and obviously those players at the table who can do that rather dominate the game (I noticed less able players glazing over during some of the explanations of why a particular result was achieved).

This game is just awesome. From the comic feel of the rulebook, to the amazing art on the cards to the great balance in the game itself! The light hearted superhero theme is fantastic too.

So many combinations of characters/villains/environments - means we'll never actually play every combo possible. And that's before even getting a single expansion :)

It's a great mixture of easy to explain/play with difficulty of beating the villain. It's great that the rulebook itself details how complex the characters are to play, so it's easy to know which characters to offer to the newer players in the group.

All in all, this game works so well I had to give it a 10. A mark like this is rare for me, but I don't imagine ever turning down the opportunity to play this one!

After four or five plays, my enthusiasm has waned. Initially I rated this a "7", but as I kept playing, I realized how tedious keeping track of all the changing information becomes. Card plays often change hero and villain abilities completely, and since many such cards may be played on a turn, keeping track of the abilities and how the abilities interact can be confusing.

Ultimate superhero game. The rules are simple but generate a great thematic card game full of opportunities for clever card play and meaningful decisions. It may be elusive at first but as soon as you know what is going on you can see the multitude of possibilities. The theme is carefully integrated and the variety provided by the number of available decks is breathtaking. Sentinels is the very definition of awesome.

9.12.13 I have a few plays under my belt. I have upgraded my rating from 7 to 8. The game really does a good job at (comically) simulation a fight between heroes and a villain. While there can be a bit of book keeping in all the pluses, minuses, and adjustments, I find them right before the edge of too much. Our games have been close and we look forward to fighting a new villain with new heroes. I like that you can get low on cards, but usually you have a few options on what to do. With more heroes, the choices get more enhanced and fun.

Interesting co-operative card game. Nice variety in set-up, particularly when adding expansions. Different combinations of heroes, villains and locations can result in a big swing in difficulty . Best played with higher hero numbers (3+) as found very difficult with just two. Arguably the best implementation of the super-hero theme around as he heroes all feel and handle differently. Art is merely OK and he game can be very fiddly to manage. We'll worth checking the iOS app out , which is a great implementation of he game that removes a lot of the fiddiness.

Good thematic co-op card game with out having to deck build. Executes on the superhero theme with art, flavor text, and character/card abilities. It scratches the co-op itch in the card game style. I love that the rule book rates difficulty of heroes and villains--that makes it much easier to bring experienced CCG players and neophytes to the same table and give them a character that challenges but doesn't overwhelm them.

my friends love this game. i really like the idea of the different villains and the environment in upheval and managing the powers of a hero! rawr! yeah! the lure is the many options and strategies a team can bring to any situation, right? yeah! okay, but the way it plays is more like co-op Carcassonne: draw and play and draw and play... little option, little choice, little sense of player agency or effect on the game. in fact, since you draw AFTER you play, the hero round sees most everyone already lined up to do the one thing they can do (very likely the same thing they did last round) without much discussion. speeds things up, i guess. my take is that the game could be more interesting without the cards, but then it'd be a roleplaying game. actually, it seems like the cards are there so that the bad stuff can cause you to discard all the time which somehow feels less punishing than a simple lost turn. if you're looking for tension, go play Pandemic. if you're looking to get beat down and punished, this is the game for you. seriously, have those hit point counters close at hand. there will be blood. anyway, i will say that it's more fun solo since then the player DOES have some options. playing 2-player with four heroes is also a step up, but juggling hands increases the fiddly factor. i'd strongly recommend you try the app before buying. oh, and get the oversized villain cards: i may not love the art, but those things are pretty cool.

This game immerses you in the superhero world. Each hero feels "real" and unique. Each villain is portrayed brilliantly and the environments you combat them in are wonderful. This games gives you the sensation that you are trading blows with the villains and that the battle is not going to be quick nor easy. Absolutely superb! I would rate this a 10 if the game was not so fiddly with having to remember to apply all the "start of turn" and "end of turn" effects which can pile up for some of the characters.

One of favorites. If you love super heroes and have been looking for a super hero game, this is it. No drafting a hodge podge of cards that don't thematically make sense. You and your friends all work together, picking heroes that you want to play, to take down the big bad. My only complaints would be that the core set can get bland after a while. I would highly recommend the expansions. My other complaint is that there is a LOT of calculation that needs to be done and kept track of and that can be off putting for some groups. I highly recommend the companion app to assist with this.

Edit: I have recently brought my review down from a 10 to a 7.5 after the honeymoon phase. Don't get me wrong, I still really enjoy this game and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun cooperative super hero experience. However, the time a game can take can be draining, especially with a lot of calculations even with the companion app. Pretty much what I said a few months ago, but know that it will begin to wear on you more as time goes on.

RATING: 4
--Oct2011-- It's amusing, if trivial.  Our first outing didn't have a lot of tension:  it didn't appear that the superhero side was in any danger of losing, nor was there any sense that there were any difficult decisions.  It's possible there are more difficult environments and villains - it'd be nice to have the default view give some hint of that, though.
--Nov2015-- And a couple plays since.  For starters, it's a coÃ¶p; and I generally don't like coÃ¶ps.  Secondly, for me, the theme doesn't come through:  so there remains a limited set of not-terribly-interesting decisions, and a lot of fiddly bureaucracy in remembering the upkeep and modifiers.  The result is something rather unimpressive.  I'd rather not play than play at this point.

Great great great game.  Probably one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a while.  Every game is different with multiple options for villains, heroes, environments, and layouts.  Can be very thematic with the right setup.  I enjoy the almost-puzzle aspect to it when deciding what cards to play and what powers to use.  In fact, this is the only board game that I really will play solo when the family is out of town.  Downsides are the rules are not very well thought out and you are forced to go to the web for clarification.  Price is very reasonable at about $30.  Highly recommended and I will never turn down a game!

RATING: 2
For several characters you can play in this game there is really nothing for you to do other than play a very obvious best card in a hand of cards that have little differences each turn, and then wait a terribly long time for your turn to come around again to play another super obvious card. This game is terrible. I've had people tell me "But the app is really good, because you play all the characters, therefore the game is good!" The app very well may be better, but that doesn't make this game good. If it wanted to be a decent video game, it should have only existed as a video game. As a board game, this game is a boring chore to play.

[color=#CC0000]

A very dry luck-then-decision game with no way to play the odds to catch a break.  It's a shame, because the theme and concept have the opportunity to break the mold and bring something more dramatic to the cooperative concept.  But it's not there.  This is a puzzle to be solved and at the end you don't have a pretty picture to look at.

Put some decision-then-luck in the rules and this game would be much better, perhaps great.  As it stands it's a very mechanical play where the player doesn't feel empowered.

Ugh. Hit points. Play card, do damage. Play card, do damage. Repeat until done. Unfortunately, card games necessarily tend to strip away all the fluff of roleplaying games to the base mechanics of damage, revealing the same mediocre mechanics you've seen in RPGs and elsewhere.

RATING: 7.5
Cooperative superhero game, full of random powers and crazy events! Developing a strategy for this game is difficult when you can't control card-draws, and the bookkeeping aspect can get a bit daunting; "Okay. I'm plus one attack from this card, but this card makes me plus two when taking damage, and this card makes my fire attacks null-in-void, but I have this irreducible attack that can't be blocked, but every time I use it everyone else is susceptible to lightning damage for one turn....(head explodes)" It really is a bear to keep track of, and you'll surely miss something.

That being said, the game is VERY fun. All the different combinations you can play with, even just in the base set, are really awesome, and the 'you-never-know-what-you're-gonna-get' aspect just makes you want to keep playing over and over again.

Well done.

I'm not trading the expansions - too busy playing them with my other copy...

(Original box also available - but it's famously too small. I'll gladly give both).

moderately accessible Narrative Co-op 

Love love love his one...have only played it solo, but have played upwards of 50 games of it...have shelled out far too much money for custom card designs by BGG fans, The Couldron set primary among them. Genius! Love that the chars are not held down by baggage of established superheroes, that the game has no deckbuilding, but a preprepared deck, that it ratchets up to extremely hard, and that it's so easy to put narrative on the play as it occurs.

sure, there's some adding and the like, but I don't find it onerous--and I'm often playing 5 characters & villain simultaneously!

My fave character is Titan, from The Couldron. I've designed my own version of BPRD, with him as Hellboy, and others as the rest of his team. Then I imagine ongoing soap opera style dramas based on the games played. Team members die and are replaced, villains die and are replaced, or come back from the dead. Fun!

I was originally scared off by the fiddliness of the game and my concern that I wouldn't be able to keep track of everything playing solo. But I couldn't stop being attracted to the game so I eventually wrote myself a program to alleviate the fiddliness problem and have since bought the game and enjoy it a lot. I anticipate eventually buying one or two expansions as well once I've played the base game many times over.

After being lukewarm to this originally, I picked up a cheap copy of the much unwanted first edition, and find it an enjoyable game. It's a little swingy depending on the boss you fight and the player count, but it actually does a good job of thematically emulating a fight between a team of supers and a villain. The card play is very fun and the way players can play off of one another is great. It's sort of like a more shallow Lord of the Rings LCG, but in a single box, and playable for 3-5 (though with 5 play the hard villains).

But otherwise a lot of tough choices and close scrapes and it tells a good story.

This is a thematic cooperative game. The difficulty needs to be balanced by hand, and the game can be frustrating at times. You can adjust the difficulty by changing the number of heroes and using the advanced rules. With the new edition and the expansions, you can also balance the game by changing the value of H. 

The characters play differently, and you can try many different synergies between characters. Between the combination of heroes, the environment, and the villain, you can have an enormous number of combinations. Even with the exact same setup, you can have a very different game depending on what comes up. Occasionally the cards will just come together to either make you win or lose.

There are several poor design decisions that mar Sentinels. Many of the villains have cards of wildly varied power, but they don't play many cards, so they can basically sit there with their thumb up their butt, which isn't very interesting. This is exacerbated by heroes that can do deck manipulation, which against those villains can make them do nothing relevant. 

Some heroes are not interesting to play, and the action economy for some isn't where it needs to be for them to compete with the other heroes. The most egregious example of heroes that are not interesting to play are heroes that can make themselves invulnerable in exchange for not doing anything. Certain villains do mostly damage to the hero with the highest health, so the most useful thing you can do for the team in a situation like that is to make yourself invulnerable, walk away from the table, come back half an hour later and ask if they've won yet.

Sentinels also offers potentially an enormous amount to keep track of. In the base game that's not such a big deal, but with some of the expansion heroes and villains it can become a problem.

My experience with Sentinels has varied from excellent, engaging sessions to absolute tedium with a million things to keep track of. It's a great idea, and I think with a bit better design work it could have been one of the best cooperative games around. Unfortunately, due to those design issues I've largely lost interest in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Sentinels of the Multiverse is a great idea for a cooperative game, and it can be incredibly fun, but it can also be monotonous and fiddly. 

My main issues with the game are:

1: The heroes aren't consistent enough in what they can do, which hurts the game thematically.

2: Some heroes are just awful compared to others. If this was part of a system in which some heroes were supposed to be stronger in order to make the game easier, that would be fine, but they're all supposed to be at the same level, and they're not even close.

3: Many of the villains have a few really powerful cards and a bunch of cards that do very little, and will either be a massive fight or complete pushovers depending on which cards they draw.

4: The game is too fiddly.

5: You don't have enough to do if you only control 1 hero.

6: Poor design choices make certain things too easy to hard counter in a completely boring way, such as controlling which cards the villain plays and making them do nothing threatening the whole game.

7: The difficulty is too random.

8: Many of the environments are annoying and feel unthematic. 

Overall the execution is poor in many places, and leads to extremely uneven experiences.

I love this game.  It might not be for everyone but I really like coop games. I also like when games have a really straight forward basic rules set with lots of variation and interesting combos.  Sentinels has that in spades.

RATING: 4
The theme is fun and if I was into the back story, it would be even better. The characters all feel different. The game is very balanced so it is always nail biting to try to win, not an easy game to win. This was a different way to play a card game that I have not seen, that was fun.

RATING: 5
Minimalistic design (play a card and use a power, then draw a card each turn, while the 'villain' and 'environment' are simply 'crisis decks') that allows for variety and creativity from cards. Could either view this as the bare essence of a cooperative game or as lacking something, and with this being a generic comic-book world with a hodge-podge of heroes banding together to fight some random villain, instead of tying to some license or established setting, I'd say it needs more trimmings design-wise to compensate for my lack of interest in the theme.

Having a separate deck for each hero limits quarterbacking slightly before players get used to each character.

3+2

RATING: 7
This game is a staple in my family. If we don't know what to play we play Sentinels. Why? It's a great cooperative game that encourages interaction. Every turn we're asking each other what we should do or asking people to do stuff for us instead of just playing our hand. We own all the major expansions and love them all. The heroes all have great flavor and each of us has a different favorite list based on play style. My only complaints are the lack of possible complexity and finikieness of the game. Each hero either does damage, prevents damage, heals damage or manages decks. So if your hero doesn't deal a lot of damage, they have to have exceptional deck control or they just feel weak (Visionary being the obvious best example of this). I'd like to see a little more than just whacking damage.

RATING: 10
Sentinels is a 10 from me- especially once you start  adding to the base game. It's so cheap to get into, and such a fun game. There's a hero for everyone, and the ever-changing villains and environments make it so that one game is never quite like the others.

A bit fiddly to get going with new players but in the end it's absolutely fantastic, the combination of heroes in any one team can make a real difference - e.g. when I played Absolute Zero, I really benefited from having the Visionary on the team! Once the players get used to the mechanics, it gets much faster and much more entertaining.

Want to feel like a superhero? Choose this game. It'll be worth it!

My favorite solo game.

2015-09-04
Since I have reached exact number of plays, as the BGG rank of Sentinels of the Multiverse (rank 145 at the moment of writing), I think I should say few words...

As I learned about it, I was sure that Marvel Legendary is the better game. However when I had some money to spare I gave it a try.
I fell in love in it as soon as I played it for the first time, and I don't think it'll change very soon. As it is now, it is my favorite game that belongs to my collection.
Unfortunately, my friends don't like it for some reason, so it rarely reaches my table, unless I play by myself. But by Gods, I don't mind, cause every play is another adventure!

So I tip my hat to you, Sentinels of the Multiverse

RATING: 7
A cooperative game that feels like a RPG and has all sorts of fidgety bits to manipulate and keep track of, I thought this was going to be a smash hit with my group, I even bought a few expansions before playing the base game too many times. Without at least 4 people playing it is almost impossible to win controlling only 1 character. Some bosses feel so overpowered we don't even pick them anymore. It still is a fun game but doesn't get too much playing time with my group. I really want to love this game, maybe the app would help?

This is such an awesome card game. It has a great customizable RPG feel while you build up your character's equipment and abilities (if necessary) and allows you to work together with other players in such a fantastic and easy way. You will find yourself communicating around the table before anyone plays cards such as "well I can do this, so can you do that? Or maybe I should play this first" and you really do feel like you're plotting against an evil unpredictable mastermind.

A pretty fun game that definitely has a Ton of replay value in it as each game you get new heroes and new villians chosen.

I think I'd automatically feel the need to institute random selection of heroes in addition to villians as it would save it from ending up with all of us choosing the same hero every time. Maybe make it so that each time we randomly choose X heroes, and then everyone chooses from X.

Yes! I like it a lot. :D
What I consider the best Card game in the Superhero genre! :thumbsup:
There is so much content included in the base game, that it took quite some time for me to want to play any of the expansions. 
Even now there are some bits I haven't touched other than to organize them in the box. 
When purchased, I really did not realize just how enormous this game was.

With the fan made campaigns, Sentinels has a truly epic feel to it.
Sure some of the Heroes are simple enough that they play themselves, but there are also some amazingly complex Heroes that are a joy to decipher to maximise their capabilities.
And then we have the Villains and the locations to mix it up even more.
The variety is not just in the artwork but the mechanics and interactions between all of the decks.
I like deck-builders and constructed deck games but the static decks from Sentinels mean you can just set it up and play
The game is a bit fiddly and I was using the sidekick app to assist in my first games, but I am finding the tokens and fan created player aids provide a lot better experience (once you get used to it).

RATING: 7.5
#71 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

I wasn't impressed by Sentinels at first, but it's finally grown on me. I love that each hero has their own unique deck of cards. And those decks really feel different too in the way they impact the game. The bookkeeping in this game is atrocious, but there is an app that helps a bit. I never actually handle it myself. If I did, it might decrease in my favor. The thing I don't like about this game is that you have to constantly be referencing the many cards that come into play in front of heroes/villains/the environment to keep track of when things trigger and how they all affect each other. It's just too much for me and more than I want to do. Playing with people that don't mind keeping things straight helps except then I don't feel like I'm a full part of the team. Perhaps with more time, I'll overcome this aspect of the game to be able to engage more. I hope so because there have been many plays of this one that I really did enjoy. The sheer variability of this game given the available combinations is just amazing. Oh! And I really like playing Villains style where each hero has a villain to manage.

Always played with the expansions I own. This is a fun game giving you the feel of being an individual superhero.  Suffers from the alpha gamer like many coops.  Is a bit fiddly and can tend to be very easy or absurdly difficult. Finding the right mix of heroes, environment and villain is tricky.

This game could quickly have it's rating fall.  Getting the right mix for a good game balance is an issue.  The swingy nature of the game leaves large stretches were you are waiting to either win or loose with no chance to change the outcome and you are just waiting out the ending.

When I played this game, my group had just finished playing 3 games of Marvel Legendary. After our first game of this, we were hooked.

This is hands down the best coop game I have ever played.

If you enjoy superheroes and want to feel like you are playing one in a real live action comic book, this is THE GAME!

Pros:
+Good components
+A lot of beautiful original artwork
+Theme is flooding in this game
+A lot of hero and villain interactions
Cons:
-Some heroes are too strong and others too weak.
-Hard to track all the different damage bonuses and penalties all over the board (even with the markers)
-Game does not scale well with 2 players. Ideal number of players is 4 or 5 players.

Super thematic and fun. Tons of replayability with so many combinations of heroes and villains. I love the way you can easily make the game easier or harder with the combination of heroes and villains (and environment!). Matthew Grey's awesome difficulty score system is perfect for this (Google "xgray sentinels" to get the link). Also, make sure you play with the Sentinels Sidekick iPad app -- it removes all the fiddlyness from the game.

RATING: N/A
I don't want to call this a bad game, just not one for me.

You start off really weak without any of your buffs so the beginning plays really slowly.  This is not helped by the fact that individually most cards are fairly weak.  It is then compounded by only being able to play 1 card a turn.  Then once you get setup to some degree, villains can wipe the board essentially sending you back to the start.

I wouldn't even call the game hard, just long and slow.  As mentioned you need to setup and there are definitely combos that are there to be found.  Unfortunately your choices on every turn are slim.  I often find myself with 5 cards in my hand. 2 of those can't be played because they are "limited" and already in play.  At least 1 is usually useless for the given situation or would hurt us more than help.  So often times there is only 1 actually valid option to even play.

As a side note.  This game really suffered from its art in my game group.  Maybe the style is what some people enjoy, but everyone I showed it to disliked it.  The quality seems really sub par even taking into account the style.  This made it incredibly hard for me to convince people to even want to play it.

As straightforward as superheroes should be. Does captures that epic feel of disproportionate challenges matched by equally gigantic responses. Also, gameplay and interactions are much more interesting and less tactical than it may appear at a first glance.

too cool for school. Using pen and paper kinda turned me off from the first edition, but Enhanced edition solves that. Love the authentic comic book feel. My nephew asked if this was based on real comic book characters, and was surprised to find out that it was not -- that's a good sign

If you have an imagination there is ton of flavor, despite middling artwork and being a card game etc. However. I'm not really seeing that much strategy so far.

The downside is that even with the enhanced edition, there can still be a lot of buffs, debuffs, and damage bookkeeping to keep track of.

A very thematic co-op.  Seems to be a lot of variety in the player decks as well as the villain and environment decks, so there should be great replayability.  I wish there were better methods for tracking hps and damage.

Update: Improved my rating a bit.  This is game is growing on me.  It is important to pick a hero whose deck matches your personal gameplay preferences to get the most out of it.  I look forward to seeing them all in play eventually.

Update: Moved rating up a bit more.  I've now seen all the heroes in action and I am impressed with the variety offered.  I signed up for Kickstarter to help fund the second expansion.

Update: Received the second expansion and it adds a ton to the game.  Moved the rating up another point.

Update: Introduced it to several new gamers and all loved it, some even going out to buy their own copies. Moved rating up a bit more.

Update: Received the third expansion which again added a ton to the game.  Moved the rating up to a 10. One of the very best games in the market today.

Some games are "dice fests"...but Sentinels has created a new category altogether I'll call "text-fest."  The concept of elegance is absolutely devoid in this entire game. Instead of organizing information on the cards into symbols or easily remembered mechanics, you're constantly trying to keep in mind the abilities and conditions of upwards of 10 enemy cards in front of you, not including your own or your teammate's.  If you're lucky, you'll have one guy in the group (as ours did) that was "moderating" the game and reminding everyone what each card does. 

This is sloppy, sloppy design.  I hope this unending text style is not a trend that continues. 

An absolute, utter bore.

IF you hate to play games that require reading too much, you won't like this game. Like all decent card games, Sentinels rewards repeated plays. In fact, it keeps getting beter and better and new surprises pop up. New players might be put off by the counting and book keeping bit... it IS a tad fiddly...for a card game at least...
HOwever, after playing it so many times and getting used to all that, its still worth fiddling around with. different synergies w different heroes create many interesting moments and experiences.

There are indeed challenges for scaling the game but they are of a straightforward mathematical nature and can be readily dealt with.   I play this mostly two player.  It's not as much fun to play with two heroes per player, though.  It's more enjoyable to get into your single character.  We play so that each hero simply gets two back-to-back turns.  This brings the game back up to the properly designed 4-turn structure.   Good game!

Superhero-themed cooperative card game.

Instead I feel I'm reading cards, and checking them frequently, playing and discarding cards, allocating damage, adjusting hit points, turning over cards, checking for modifiers of other cards and hit points, etc. - a bit tedious, frankly.  Also, wording on many of the cards seemed to us to lack clarity, and the interactions between cards, effects and actions etc seemed sometimes to not make sense (even in an admittedly 'super' universe).  Lots of things to keep track of, and lots of resorting to the rulebook, substantial rules FAQs/clarifications, and the BGG rules forum (often without success).

To me the games we had also seemed very uneven (in terms of balance), and fiddly to play - and requiring 3 or 4 players, not 2 (unless you play 2 heroes each, which makes it more fiddly and complicated and takes away from the RPG type experience).  

I do love the theme, the artwork, and the obvious passion the designers/publishers have put into it, but - to my great regret (as I bought Rook City too) - the game itself failed to grab me.    :-(

This is a cooperative card game where each player plays a unique hero with a unique deck of cards and special powers against a unique villain with a unique deck of cards and powers...in a unique environment with a unique...you get the idea.

There is a lot of asynchronous stuff to experience in this game and that makes it so intriguing to me.  I love variability and even though the base game only comes with 4 villains there are also 4 different environments and 10 different heroes to play with.

Now, this is a lot of stuff but I usually roll my eyes at people that would point to something like this and say this makes it infinitely replayable because of the different combinations you can make.  For me, the combinations don't matter.  If I keep playing the same 4 villains over and over again I will get bored even if I did play in a unique location or with a unique hero each time.

That said though the actual game play was so much fun.  Each player had a unique role and unique things they could do and served a different purpose in the fight while the villain had a wide variety of nasty tricks and surprises for us.  It presented us with a very good level of challenge without feeling impossible.  I really enjoyed how it all came together.  There is also a lot of expansion and promotional content out for this game already so if you really wanted to imbue more variety into the game it is available.  All-in-all a good cooperative game.

I do have to point out that the game is probably best played with no more than 4 players.  The game doesn't do the best job balancing difficulty across player numbers.  There are some cards that scale in damage/health/etc. based on player numbers but not all and everything else is the same.  So with more players that's just more chances the heroes get to do stuff in between every villain turn with only some cards hitting harder or taking bigger hits.  I've played it once with 4 and once with 5.  With 4 the game was suitably difficult and a fun challenge.  With 5 the game was boring, we just crushed it.  I would guess the game would go the other way with only 3, making it nigh impossible.

This didn't really do it for me, I love card games and card combat but this was too much card reading, it interrupted the game flow.
I am rather neutral to the superhero theme, the guys in my game group did get a lot of fun out of the different characters and their abilities though, proves me and my taste are not the target group for this game. Eh, I'd rather play something else, I thought it dragged a lot but doesn't it automatically when you are not enjoying yourself?

One of the best card games in terms of developing a narrative and bringing a genre alive - you really do feel like you are participating in a knock-down drag-out superhero battle.  Moreover each of the hero characters has it's own unique theme and mechanism which makes the various decks feel very different from one another.  My only complaint is that there is a LOT of bookkeeping and when first getting to know the game it can be really hard to keep track of all the hit points, damage modifiers and missed/extra actions.

I think the new edition of the his game fixes a lot of the problems that people used to have with it (though one could argue those fixes really first appeared in Rook City). 

This is one of those games where the mechanics are relatively simple, and most of whatever complexity one will encounter comes down to the individual cards.

I really enjoy the fiction of this series, even though most of it is far more implied than spelled out.  I can easily see this becoming one of my go to solitaire games.

Co-ops tend not to excite me all that much, card games often downright bore me, and I don't have the slightest interest in superheroes.  So imagine my surprise when I discovered quite a decent little game here!  Sure, it's fiddly as all hell, but it has a lot of things going for it: many different heroes each with unique play styles, many different villains each presenting different challenges, many different settings providing unique environments, a nicely stylized superhero theme, a central mechanism reminiscent of deck-building that gives the feeling of powering up your characters, and nearly endless replayability thanks to the first few points I just listed.  It's a very good game for which I am not the target market!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

Great theme play!  Game is easy to learn and play but will take some plays to get strategies.  Fun, challenging game.  No new game mechanics.

Depending on the villain/environment combo the game can be long and may drag.

Everyone gets a deck of cards for the hero they want to play. You battle the bad guy together. With the expansions you have lots of characters to choose from, and an "environment" set-up adds even more variety to the game. Tip: have your fastest and most experienced player run the environment and villain cards. This will help keep the game from bogging down.

Also in the same box: All heroes from Rook City, Infernal Relics, Shattered Timelines, Wrath of the Cosmos, and Vengeance.

RATING: 9.5
This game (even the revised edition) has the most inadequate rulebook I've ever seen.  The game's owner thought that villains heal completely on flipping, which makes sense for Baron Blade but not for villains like Voss, who can repeatedly flip back and forth.  We're still not sure whether one player is always the start player, or if it rotates, or if the players can choose what order to act in each round.  The bios are nice, if at times a bit silly, but I would have sacrificed them all for the standard level of rulebook clarity.

The game also doesn't scale well; each extra player typically just means that the villain will do an extra point of damage with various attacks, which doesn't come close to matching the gain to the heroes.  The five of us actually felt bad for Baron Blade in our first game; Voss fared better but we still had loads of power to spare on his defeat.  With only three players it would have been a heck of a lot more difficult.

There are also an awful lot of cards to keep track of, which can leave you checking through a lot of text to make sure that you haven't forgotten any effects or modifiers.

But for all that, this is an excellent game!  In particular, it compares favourably with the recent Marvel and DC games.  Sentinels actually has a story progression, where what the villain is doing changes as the game goes on.  Each hero has their own deck, so you feel like you're actually playing as that hero rather than each player being bits and pieces of various heroes (as in Legendary), or having your deck composed of a smorgasbord of hero equipment and villains that you've apparently co-opted to your cause (as in DC - this is amusing, but not very thematic).  I'm not even a big fan of co-op games, but this one works for me, probably because each hero has so much stuff going on that no one can take over the group; discussion tends to be about what you can accomplish rather than what you should do, along the lines of, "I can take care of the minions on my turn if you can get rid of that shield first.  Can someone deal with that environment card before it wrecks more of our equipment?", which is the sort of planning heroes would be doing.  It's also good that there are no individual scores, since the players need to coordinate as a team and that would wreck cohesion.

Also, Tachyon rocks.

RATING: 7
On the 7/8 border for me. Good game that is fairly immersive, a little broken by the start of turn and end of turn tracking and keeping up with damage +/-'s. can see this improving with more plays. Nice artwork, although a Marvel version would have been incredible. Like the idea of the environment decks as well just to spice things up rather than just have Hero vs Villain. See how this goes. Oh, and you get a heck of a lot of stuff in the basic set - puts Smash Up to shame.

Sold UK Games Expo 2015. I picked up the App, and that does all the hard work for you, making the game fun, so don't need the boxed game anymore. Shame, really.

With nearly 600 cards, this is one of the best value for money co-op cards games you can buy.

Very fun game that captures the thematic feel of being a superhero. However, the game has a lot of design problems. Many heroes require the right cards to "work" and are otherwise horrible. Plus, some hero / villain match ups are super easy or super hard. They really need to have a "suggested list" for what heroes should fight what villains. Also, there's a lot of clunkiness with some cards having to check and recheck all the statuses. It can get very, very bogged down, especially considering it is supposed to be a fast and fun game. Besides those negatives, the game is very fun. Would love to see an Android app of the game that handled all the fiddliness.

The DC Deck Building game is fast and fun.

Marvel Legendary is my favorite deck building game.  Love the heroes, the villains, and the scheme twist combinations.

Sentinels if my favorite Super Hero game though.  When I play the other games I think they are thematic to varying degrees but neither of them makes me feel like I am playing as a super hero.  Sentinels does.  What a great concept and it's executed so well with the mechanics, art, and quotes on the cards.  Each deck feels like that hero and they all play so differently.

There are so many different combinations to try out between the heroes, environments, and villains.

The enhanced edition fixed my issue with tracking health points pretty well.  

Last month I started playing versus each villain using their nemesis and two other heroes.  I will keep playing until all villains are vanquished.  I need to play this more often!

I picked up the Guise, Water Master, Celestial Tribunal and chokepoint. I think the Tribunal environment was my favorite.

Fun game that captures the super-hero theme well. Fun to play, though cards are poorly presented; way too wordy. Difficulty is a little wonky; some villains are very easy, other villains are nearly impossible unless you have a particular hero, when they then become easy. Overall I like it a lot, but wish it were a little more "neatly" designed.

Sentinels seemed like a great idea, and then we started playing it.  Boooooooooooooring.  Some of the decks literally did nothing.  There were too many duplicate cards and it didn't really go anywhere. A completely boring take on co-ops which is a shame because the idea is awesome.

For the most part, SotM is an enjoyable game; however, there are certain combinations (heroes, villain, environment) that skew the game toward being near impossible to beat or a cakewalk. Also, the game doesn't scale incredibly well -- that is, a 5 player game is a lot easier than a 3 player version. More often than not, though, this game is a lot of fun and generally balanced (though it can feel a bit same-y from game to game).

I love the theme, it's integration, the artwork and the general idea of the game. Alas, the multiple cards make the game pretty repetitive (even in just the one play) and the cards always seem to be fairly obvious how to play them for maximum effect. It seemed a lot like the game was playing itself while we were just reading out the (admittedly, pretty good) flavour text.

On a second play, every thing I said above holds true. Just lacking in interesting/meaningful decisions.

Rating down from 6.5 to 5.

Sat down and played the first game of this with 2 friends in an attempt to defeat the Baron.  I'm not sure what to think of this game.  It was fun...in fact, I remember thinking how kick@$$ it was as soon as I realized how to play my character.  Each seems to be very unique, and that's good!!  But, the Baron kicked our @$$ big time.  I wonder if we were playing it wrong, because we were just getting him to flip by the time we were each nearing our point of defeat.  So, we stopped there.

Need to re-review the Baron's rules to see what we did wrong, because I've read he's supposed to be easy! :o

Looking forward to a rematch, Baron!!!

This is actually a very well executed cooperative superhero game that mechanically works fantastically with it's theme.  It's easy to get wrapped up in what you are doing and certainly collectively as a team.  This is even further supported by the multiple decks available making each game pretty unique.  The artwork is good, something about it didn't sit right with me at first but after seeing the extent of it, it grew on me.  It's an easy teach and the rules are well put together.  The game-play is quick with some table talk between rounds, actions are somewhat limited but that's not a bad thing for what it is.  It's not heavy but you do need to work together to succeed, so there is a little strategy and discussion as to how best use your cards on a given turn.

Fun game, but a bit of a mess. There are tons of modifiers to keep track of, and the experience can be inconsistent depending on the mix of heroes and villains. The co-op "puzzle" that the team is trying to solve is opaque and hidden behind a heavy layer of individual small challenges (aka henchmen) that are the true heart of this game's experience. I prefer a more cohesive experience in my co-op games; however, there is enough here to bring me back if someone really wants to play Sentinels. It may not be my preferred cup of tea, but I can appreciate the appeal.

This is a great game - unless you are playing it with a whole bunch of newbies at once.  There is a LOT of reading for each card (and the cards aren't always clear as to what they are meant to do) and the end result in this scenario is a  game that isn't very fluid.

Once they players get familiar with this game, however, then it begins to shine!

I've definitely enjoyed playing this one, with friends or solo.  The only two times I've not had a good experience with it was once when it was too easy (four players vs. Omnitron - two players' first experience with it and they were underwhelmed) and once when it was ridiculously hard on a solo play (bad deck draws for some characters I didn't enjoy that much anyway. UPDATE: More and more plays have led to more and more frustrating experiences.  I rarely advocate for this game anymore and only begrudgingly play it.  I can play it with people who are good at it and like it, but I give up with it on my own or with me leading/teaching it to new folks. (Rating over time went from 8 to 7 to 6).

Great game.  Initially there's a few rules quirks to iron out; things like simultaneous effects and triggered effects; mostly minor stuff.  But once you get rolling, it's awesome!  Has a very roleplaying feel to it, with superheroes, and no GM required.  Sometimes you get hosed, and sometimes you walk all over the villain .  Overall, this is a very good game, and one that superhero comic fans should definitely play.

Sentinels of the Multiverse just oozes with theme, and the game play works well with the superhero motif. The art and characters are fun, although it seems to me some heroes are definitely better than others. The only part I hated was that the game didn't scale well for different numbers of players, but that apparently is being fixed in the new printing. I probably need to pick this one up.

An excellent team super hero experience.

It is fun to pick a hero and play with their powers and experiences. Even if they are fiddly, your heroes is yours to enjoy their character.

However, the environment and villain are also fiddly, and it is less fun to play with those situations because they have no choices involved just doing the AI system and it takes much more time than it does to play the hero turn. So, we will see if the iOS development can do good things for the bad parts of fiddly and keep the good parts. The system is out for iOS and Steam. It has gotten rave reviews but I haven't paid the $10 for either version. I have visions of streaming playing the game. I am also waiting of the multiplayer version - and to have $10.

RATING: 9
Was a 10 for about 4 years. Now (2015) when I want to play it, I think that either I have obvious choices, I spend more time fiddling then with narrative, and I have to explain or correct many details to all the players. And if someone else is "leading" the game, then I can pretty much just check out and then play a good card on my turn. There isn't that much difference between playing an ok turn and a great one, so it isn't worth the investment of mental energy to understand the whole table.
I am frustrated because I love this game but it has worn off. When I've tried the expansions they've added characters with more tricks, which takes even more mental energy, and I didn't want that. I want more adventure. I had Wrath of the Cosmos expansion and traded it away quickly.

I can see the criticism for this game. The strategy and/or tactics in this one are bar to none. If you're looking for a nice happening, this is a great option to read aloud flavor text and indulge (hopefully)in comic book atmosphere. This is for boardgaming now what Dragon's Lair was for video gaming in the mid 80s. An optically very pleasing appearance with the comic theme perfectly staged with lots of love for the details, unfortunately gameplay doesn't live up to these standards and instead of gameplay you have "Game plays. You watch."

Excellent and simple, and with lots of fun variety right out of the box: 10 heroes, 4 villains, and 4 environments. The newer Enhanced Edition is especially nice, since it comes with counters (the original required you to keep track of things like hitpoints with pencil and paper, which wasn't a big deal but meant you needed to remember them when taking it on a trip or something).

RATING: 5
This is a fantastic game that deserves it's rabid fandom and billion expansions, if you haven't tried it yet. Good for solo or co-op, it's a fight simulator where the opponent deck runs itself and you build a team and run a highly tactical session of table talk planning to work together to defeat the villain/s. A plethora of heroes, villains, and environments, mixed up more by alternate heroes and hard rule villains, and different teams compositions and sizes.

I'm not sure how practical it is to play this game without the core set, which is sort of a shame... because the major problem with this is that most of the most fun heroes, villains, and environments are in later expansions... Many in the base set are either boring or weak.

There's so much to like here. First of all, the amount of variety is incredible. Between all of the expansions you've got an enormous amount of heroes, villains, and environments that all function completely differently. When you mix them together, you've got a unique game every time.

Second, this is the most thematic superhero game that I've played (the others being generic deckbuilders with a pasted-on theme: DC Deckbuilding and Marvel Legendary). Each hero has his own unique deck, and the art and names on the cards help give a sense what's happening. Characters put on equipment, use on-shot abilities, and use various powers to take down the villains all while dealing with environmental hazards. Being an original design is also a huge plus, because it means the game world isn't just limited to certain characters - this game can make their own versions of all sorts of popular superheros, plus other characters from pop-culture. This means that we have a game where there is an Iron Man character, a Batman character, and even a Predator villain all in the same game. Not to mention The Dude from The Big Lebowski being a playable character. Very cool.

Third, the gameplay. Unlike other game that use a generic Dominion-clone deckbuilding system, this one uses a system of unique cards that are specific to each deck, more similar to a CCG. This results in a tactical game where you're always deciding which card is best to play based on the current situation. Do I put down some equipment to prepare for the next turn, or do I use a one-shot to hit the villain while he's vulnerable?

I've only got a couple of issues with the game. First is the card quality. The cards are obviously very cheap quality but that is offset by the low cost of the game. Still, I would rather pay a little more to get better quality stuff.
Another thing is that the game can be very fiddly. You'll have several heroes, several villains and henchmen, and several different environment cards that all affect different parts of the game at the same time. This means you're constantly having to put down modifier tokens and re-read cards to make sure you're playing correctly. After a few games it gets easier, but it's still a bit of a pain.
Last, the difficulty can be really uneven because of the amount of variety. Some games it becomes obvious early on that the heros don't have a chance, and other games you just destroy everything with ease. I would really like to see some sort of official guide to adjust the difficulty based on which heroes/villains/environments are in play.

Overall, this is a great co-op that is always fun to play and the best superhero game on the market.

Probably my favourite pure-coop game.  Great theme, great art, tons of detail and character history in the cards if you're willing to dig a bit.

Mechanics are simple and intuitive, but you can end up with a bit too much minor arithmetic once you have a table full of cards.

Excellent replayability and very easy to expand.

Updated comment:  No longer for trade! I am proud to shout that from the rooftops!
My exploration of Marvel:Legendary led me back here, to this game that I already owned.  I had not played it in ages, having concluded it was much too fiddly and simply frustrating to play (even though the theme is so darn strong).  

As of this writing I can honestly say that this game has been on my thoughts an awful lot for at least three weeks now.  I just cannot get enough of it.  It's important that I credit that to my streamlining efforts/ideas (noted below).  I even plan on picking up expansion material before Christmas.  

Seriously, this is a complete 180!  I wonder if that will ever happen for me regarding LOTR:LCG?

Updated (December 2016): It's now Jack Darwid's 2-player variant that has me cruising on this.  I think I am becoming the "variant" guy!

Old Comments:

#1 Got it in a trade. Really do like this game but it has its issues and they are starting to wear on me.

Without the iPad AP the bookkeeping gets crazy to the point that I am discouraged from playing. More work than I had bargained for so it loses a point of rating for that.

#2 I've decided to give this game another try (its still on the trading block though).  My plan is to use only decks with a complexity of 1 or 2. I will avoid the 3's and 4's for now (maybe forever).  This really decreases the pool for flavour, but the replayability should be fine because its easy to adjust the difficulty while keeping complexity low.

Good about the game: The Sentinel universe! Fun!
Not good about the game: The amount of bookkeeping just depresses me.

Played 3 times with 4 players each time, once with the designer.  1st game was excellent!  Chris is amazingly enthusiastic; I wish he was selling my games!  But, having to run the tokens and counters and do book-keeping on subsequent plays has become a hassle.  

I enjoy how the different decks create an atmosphere of collective engine building.  To get me to play a thematic super-hero game with co-op elements and actually "like" it, is a huge feat!

Great theme. I've only played it once, but I love the way the different decks play out and interact. I can see once I get used to the language, I will like this game a lot in all its variety and theme.

I'm excited to explore it further.

::UPDATE::

In the end, it was just too...headachie. It required way too much work for what it delivered. The whole thing could use a component upgrade in order to simplify a lot of the fiddly, moving parts and modifiers in the game.

I gave it away in a Christmas Gift Exchange in 2015.

01/2013: To its credit, the game plays out like a comic book. The art and characters are well done and successfully bring out the many tropes of super-herodom.

Much of the game is outside of your control, but there's just enough choices in your hand of cards to feel like there's a game here (and not just a setup that plays for you).

Overall, this is still pretty light fair. A good option to play with kids or young teenagers who can handle a bit of complexity.

It's pretty hard to find major fault with this game. It completely solves the quarterbacking problem that exists in nearly all other co-ops by giving each player their own unique cards. The art is perfect, the villains are great, and it's dripping with theme. My only gripes are that it is fiddly (we use the iOS companion app for bookkeeping, which helps) and that some villains do feel somewhat samey.  

Oddly enough, I think I'd like this game less if it used established comic book characters from the DC or Marvel universes. Greater Than Games has created a fantastic world that isn't restricted by the personas/abilities of existing characters.

One of my top co-op/solo games. Love the theme and the replayability that comes from all the heroes/villains. A top game with my friends, especially not so heavy gamers.

Over time, I've found this to be a bit fiddly and have started using it more for solo play. Also started playing on the computer more often. However, I still break out the cards when I want to get a better feel for a deck or just to relax with physical components.

Another of my favorite solo games and my favorite thematic game, and IMO the coolest superhero themed game out now. It is a little fiddly with all those modifiers, counters, tokens and stuff, but still manageable (but if you dislike fiddlieness, maybe opt for the app version of this). You really feal like a super hero, and all heroes play differently (and all villains feel differently when you fight them).

One of the best superhero games on the market.  Each hero feels very different and fun to play in their own way.  However, the amount of tokens, damage reduction, element immunity, enemies, environments, start of turn, end of turn, 'first time someone attacks this' and things like that get in the way of the game.  Just too many things to remember / keep track of.
Although I prefer playing it in person, once you get the app or steam version, it's hard to play it any other way.

My one play, which was a long time ago, wasn't a perfect experience - while I like superheroes as much (or maybe a bit more) than the next guy, find the artwork appropriate and enjoyable, and have no objections to the general game mechanics, the whole experience was just too fiddly, with too many things to keep track of. This was especially annoying because most of those things have a very small impact on anything - so it never felt reasonable to roll back to the point where we last forgot something and play again from there, but the nagging feeling didn't go away.

The reason why the game is on this list, then, is the fact that I feel I should give it a second chance and either verify the first game opinions and forget about it, or discard them.

This is a very good game, that's much better on PC because of the odd layering of rules and timing.  I often make minor mistakes like forgetting about one of two effects on a card, or processing an effect at the end of a turn instead of the beginning of a turn - and the difference is *critical!*

A super heroes bash villain co-op game.

Great theme implementation, decent flow of play, good replayability, amazing narrative. Especially in the latter, the game is nearly unbeatable.

On the downside the game is less strategic than I would like. Yes there are decisions and yes there is cooperation, but they're too simple for my taste. This game lacks in mechanics.

Still in the end, the game is fun and enjoyable. If you RP a little bit, it gets even better.

Easy and simple. Does a great job of being the light-hearted fun super hero cards game that it is. Sometimes though, there are a bit many effects to keep track of, and it plays itself a bit. All the different heroes, villains and combinations gives this a very nice replay value. One of the easier to win co-op games.

It is a really cool concept. Each superhero has their own deck, giving them special abilities and upgrades. The decks give the game a lot of replay value. The game is quite fiddly, however. There is so much to keep track of and allocate the correct damages each phase. I played the game with a tracker app, and it was still difficult. Nice hair, though.

A very good, cooperative game with fast gameplay and one of the most thematic games I've played. Simple basic rules with lots of unique mechanics coming from the cards. Quite a bit of variety offered in the base game, but if you like it you should buy some of the expansions to expand that variety. With one or two of the expansions I'd call it a 9 out of 10 even.

Though I prefer the Dominion/Star Realms type of deckbuilding mechanic more than Sentinels, I have come to appreciate the simplicity of "play a card, use a power, draw a card".  It is not as fiddly as I first thought.  And I love the knock off comic book theme that is everywhere in this game. 

This game is growing on me fast.

This is a great co-op game with crunchy mechanics and a lot of replay potential.

You'll enjoy this game a lot if you enjoy working against the clock, collaborating with other players to get the job done, and maximizing your own strengths.  You have to be willing to take a hit for the team, as it is possible to get eliminated personally and still have a group win.

The artwork in this game is a little cartoon-ish, but it has some hilarious flavor text on the bottom of the cards that refer back to "Issue Numbers" like old comic foot notes used to.  Great stuff!

RATING: 9
[thing=102652][/thing] is... wow, a fantastic game! I wasn't sure what to expect since I really enjoy comics (though I don't read them anymore, because my money goes to boardgames now, but in my teens, I read almost everything since not only I bought comics, but also my friends, so we have some sort of comics club, with the comics passing hand to hand). So the theme was right in my league. I also like [thing=36218][/thing] pretty damn much. So, mechanics-wise, this one wouldn't suffer with me (I know there is players that don't like deck building). So what this game had against it? Nothing, really. I bought it twice (the first was for a friend, but I end up with the copy, which I then sold). I just wasn't sure. Now I am.

The gameplay is engaging and requires thought to make the actions of everyone work together (I only played with 3 and 4 players so far). The artwork is fantastic, setting the right mood and it is amazing that all the art is all made just for the game.

The possibilities are huge - considering the number of heroes, villains and environments that come just in the base game, and you already have hundreds of scenarios. With the expansions, this goes for the thousands. Truly no game will be the same - and even if you want the same set up, the cards will make the game different (though the feel could be the same - I can't say for sure - but in my eight plays so far, everyone feel different from the other).

Also, we fought first a villain level 1, and the battle was decided in the last cards, with the heroes seeing Death in the rear-mirror, but Ominitron fell first. The second, against a villain level 3, we were brutally defeated. I'm guessing that some villains will require a team of heroes selected just for them, but I will try to go with random heroes as much as I can - I think this is part of the fun - sure, maybe Legacy could win easier, but not always he will be avaiable (maybe he is fighting his nemesis), so Haka will have to do the job instead. -- Well, 22 plays later, I think that maybe only the villains difficult 4 might require a team made basically to face them - the level 3 villains, even though we lose a lot, I can see that they can lose to a random team with smart play.

Almost all my plays stayed inside the 1 hour (one or two, maybe, above it, by no more than 10 minutes) - a good thing, but being as fun as it is, if it took longer, I wouldn't mind, but the chances for it hit the tables would be less. One hour or a little less means more plays in my gamming group.

So, great game. I'm glad I picked this one up!

On paper this sounded like my kind of game. Superheroes and Co-op?? Yes please. Neither me nor my brother were impressed. The rules were confusing, the play was blah at best. I never got the feeling I was a superhero compared to something like Zombicide that gives you the impending doom us vs the world feeling. I may try to add in an expansion as I hear that ramps up the fun but with the cost of the games you cant just give it a go for the kind of investment they require.

RATING: 4
but wait for 2nd ed.

We've played this game loads of times, and one of our gamer friends spent ages making suggestions for how we could have better used synergies between the characters. He would email going 'I've worked out how to make all the heroes immune to damage using Legacy's powers'. He spent four games getting the Argent Adept to work (in an expansion set). I spent two games trying to get the promo Scholar to work.

It's a LOT meatier and thematic than Legendary. Legendary is basically Ascension: The Semi-Coop Superhero edition. I love Legendary because it's simple to play, fun and cooperative. But it doesn't hold a candle to Sentinels unless your main criteria is 'accessible and easy to teach'. At no point, playing Legendary, do I feel I'm playing superheroes. As I enjoy card games, regardless of theme, this isn't a problem...

In particular, Sentinels generates hilarious stories. Like the time where four superheroes took on a gang boss in a primeval swamp. His deputy was eaten by velociraptors, and the entire underworld was then blown up in a volcanic eruption. The gang boss, bizarrely, escaped due to his flameproof underpants.

After the horrifying Shut Up & Sit Down review, I permanently scratched this one off my list. Paul and Quinns mentioned that "this card modifies that card, which modifies these two cards--except when this card is in play, but only at the beginning of the round" nonsense that can only be fun for accountants, masochists, and masochistic accountants.

Gag.


It's really not that bad. Yes, there is some accounting involved as one character will buff another or the villain de-buffs another, but it's not that complicated. The enhanced edition's counters and effect tokens help a lot.

My wife and I both really enjoy this game. We have the digital version with a number of expansions, but we'd love to have the physical game.

Fun game, if a little orthodox cards with words and HP grinding. You will need someone to "administrate" - especially the card effects and hitpoint chits of the big bad and the multiple minion cards.

Phenomenal Coop despite the horrendous artwork that is somewhat mitigated by the excellent in game fluff.

Expansions add to the game without introducing broken components or island mechanics.

The best super hero themed game I have played by far. With all the buffs and card effects it can get a little clunky at times, but reference tokens help.

It does a decent job with the theme, but there didn't seem to be much in the way of decisions.

On the other hand, why include boring decks in the game?

A wonderful game. While it's fun to try different combinations of heroes/villains (as all have something to offer), definite favorites emerge (I'm generally a big fan of utility). Group involvement will make or break your playing session. It is incredibly fun to play with others who enjoy it...less so with those who aren't interested in the theme or are too afraid to play their characters for fear they will mess up.

Bah. I get it that if you like the theme it could be fun, but I found the record keeping (modifying damage, HP, etc.) to be incredibly laborious for a game that didn't provide many meaningful decisions. It always seemed like there was a pretty clear best move for each situation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I am not a big fan of co-ops, and with the high frequency at which co-ops are produced these last two years, the desire to try a new one has subsided even more. So what a surprise Sentinels was! The game just felt less mechanical or scripted than most co-ops I have played in the past, and I felt like I could really make my own choices without putting my team in danger. Gameplay wise, it felt quite a bit like a CCG with cool cards, but co-op in nature. A refreshing experience! The artwork on the cards is a mixed bag in terms of quality, but I do appreciate that all of it was done by the same artist, really conveying the feel of a 60's comic. The only drawback I can think of, is that the game does not offer any guidelines with regard to which setup is suitable for which difficulty level or numbers of players.
UPDATE: My first game with four did not go over as well as the one with two. A more complex villain made it a bit of a chore to keep track of all the card effects, especially since a lot of cards had a lot of text on them. Still like the game, but not enough to warrant a purchase.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
On paper, this game just makes a whole lot of sense. Players play individual heroes, battling a common enemy in a far-flung location. The game setting sounds just perfect for a superhero card game with individual decks representing unique powers. The variability in card play is both a boon and a big drawback for gameplay. Clearly, half the fun of playing this game is to figure out a synergy between players battling the villain. It is great when The Legacy's motivational speech can enhance damage caused by the Mist. Really cool ideas. The environment cards which I personally find annoying, can actually further increase the variability of the game.

Still, the drawbacks are somewhat significant. Like all card games, the modifiers become increasingly complicated and complex. To remember each +1, -2 modifier to stats can become a tedious exercise.  To make matters worse, there are seven to eight types of energy damage. So, not only do you have to remember a "+1", you may have to remember "+1 only to fire" or "limited +1 only to melee". All of this can bog the game down with more players as each person has to constantly remind the active player of these modifiers.

In the end, I see this game more for kids, teenagers and your adults. I see the novelty quickly wearing thin. 

Still, theme-wise nothing beats Sentinel of the Multiverse

Wow is this fiddly. For the type of game it is, and the amount of maintenance that is required to run this game, just forget it. 

This would be better as an app than a real card game. It's such a clunky design and feels like something designed by a bunch of budding designers thinking about how to make a cool card game. 

Card game design has come a long way, and for someone to not at least learn from the mistakes of others just screams to me as either laziness or ignorance. I'm hoping it's the latter, but for all the hate that Magic the Gathering receives here on BGG, Sentinels of the Multiverse is far and away a poorer and more terrible design than Magic will ever be.

Decent game, but incredibly fiddly with too many components. Also many of the characters felt to one dimensional, leaving little room for flexible methods of play.

Solo and 2 player - as long as 4 characters are used then this works just fine. Super game, really thematic and I just love the artwork.

You do have to remember a lot of modifiers throughout which can be irksome but at least the ipad app for keeping score of hit points helps. 

update: This just doesn't get played anymore, purely because of all the modifiers - it just seems like so much work and we ALWAYS end up making mistakes because there are so many modifiers. Such a shame.

A great co-op game, that turns into an amazing puzzle when played solo. The theme is deep (a one-armed, time-travelling, gunslinger? - WHAT - amazing!). And the play is simple but sweet - PLAY, POWER, DRAW. I need to play it more (a bit too much set up for solo play.)

Early rating after two plays. I have found my card-style Superhero game. Don't mind that it isn't a deckbuilder - this game treats the genre with incredible respect and fun. You are your own hero but you need teammates to defeat these bad guys. It's a tough game and I haven't won yet, but it makes me want to try again.

I thought I'd be hesitant about the artwork but it really grows on you for some reason. I'm loving it.

Will it hold up after I figure out which team combos work the best? That will be the question to answer! 

UPDATE **** 11/21/2017 ****
The game is solid but can be finicky at times. I love the iOS app for it because it tracks everything the boardgame makes a chore out of. Dropped the rating down a bit.

For me, this suffers from the same problems as the Pathfinder ACG - too much downtime, too light on decisions, too little that you actually do during your turn. You play what's obviously the best card in your hand, play it, decide what you're going to do next turn, wait five minutes for it to come back around for you, during which time you're totally disengaged, repeat the process again ad nauseum. 

It might be an acceptable solitaire game, but there are better options out there for that. 

Besides, I'm very lukewarm about superhero themes.

Smash Up done right! This game was a lot of fun to play. Unlike Smash Up, the decks this game gives out to players are actually interesting and contain lots of neat synergy and effects, and all manage to be pretty unique.

This also takes something similar to the villain mechanic from Legendary and manages to make it interesting, fitting and cool.

I am not often impressed by theme, but Sentinels nails it. You really feel like a squad of superheroes each with their own personalities showing and interacting with one another.

Also it manages to be a cooperative game that lets each player plan enough to develop their own strategies by themselves. Unlike others where a leader will command players what to do, here you can only say "you should really try to do 2 damage to this guy!" and how you choose to approach such a command, if at all, is up to you.

1st update (Feb 2013)[9]: Excellent game. I really love all the different heroes, but I'm a bit afraid of replayability over time.

It's been a while since I played a new game that I want to play all the time. Sentinels nicely mashes up simple rules that lead to complex situations, unique player cards and decks and hugely variable set ups. The only issue I have is, while it is easy to teach, the complexity builds up too much.

Includes: Ambuscade, Unity, Miss Information, The Scholar, The Final Wasteland, Silver Gulch 1883, Wager Master, Omnitron IV, Guise, Freedom Six Promo Pack

Right now this is my favorite game. I love that each deck is self contained and that it feels so thematic. I have enjoyed playing solo or with my wife. I like the fact the we can play together against a common foe. MY wife does find it a bit fiddly with all the things to account on each play.

Pretty fun superhero card game.  Only complaints I have is that scaling is not great.  There is a noticable difference in difficulty depending on how many heroes are played.  The other problem I have is I wish the rulebook was a bit more in depth with rules especially for playing specific heroes.

This may be the most entertaining and captivating game I own.  It has Immense replayability and I have a blast playing everything from a solo game (running two characters by myself) to a game of 6 (a bit large and unbalanced).

I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes superheroes or co-op games.

Incredibly fiddly and fun. Dropped from a 9 to a 7. The fiddliness detracts from the fun. Too much to keep up with. Feels like every game we have to be missing crucial adjustments.

We played with 5 players which may not have been the best thing. But even if downtime was reduced there are so many lacks in this game that I can't see myself playing it again. The most noticeable lack is that there is no quick symbol language that can easily be spotted. Instead every effect and happening, attack and whatnot has to be read from the card text. So I had a hard time keeping up with what is happening and it also dragged out on the game. I guess once you know every card by heart this is no longer an issue, but I will never get to that stage because the game is just not that good.

Components are not great, and theme doesn't appeal to me at all.  Gameplay is adequate, though not riveting.  Like many co-ops, it's all about reaction, and making the best of your situation.  The best part of the game is a huge amount of replayability.  Not only are there lots of hero decks, but there's different environments and different villains as well.  There's a little bit of generic feel to the teams as a result, but it's amazing how well the system manages to click.  For fans of trashy superhero comic books, this is a good pickup.

If you're at all a fan of superheroes, you'll probably like this game.  The love of superheroes just saturates it.  Plus, it's a great game!  It's fast, fun, and remarkably varied.  Each hero deck plays very differently, and with a wealth of heroes to choose from, that means you can have variety both in personal play and team dynamic.  

My only complaint would be that it can be difficult to keep track of all the modifiers when they begin to accumulate, or when lots of cards do damage to lots of targets.

Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of 10 heroes, against one of 4 villains, and the battle takes place in one of 4 different dynamic environments.
\13\\13\
Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which "play themselves", requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.

Sentinels of the Multiverse has captured the Super Hero genre better than any game that has come before. It's not perfect, as sometimes keeping all the card interactions straight is a nightmare...but generally it's worth the trouble because of the great narrative the game usually spits out.

In the broader realm of co-op games, it does have some weaknesses. The game is somewhat solvable if players build a team of heroes to directly counter a particular villain, while a random selection of heroes will often have no chance of winning. This can make for a frustrating dynamic, as finding a balance between challenge and fun can be difficult.

Despite this, there is still a lot here to love. The pre-constructed decks do a great job of giving each hero a unique and thematically appropriate feel and the environment decks do a great job of shaking up even the most predictable match-ups. There is also an almost infinite variety of combinations in the box, which only grows exponentially with each expansion.

If you love comic book stories, by all means get this game, you will love it. If you are just a fan of card games or co-ops in general, try before you buy. The nature of the game's A.I. creates some very complex timing issues and card interactions, which can sometimes get quite tedious. For me, it's worth it to slog through it when it happens, just to see how the story pans out. If you aren't invested in the plot, there probably isn't enough game here to ward off those frustrating moments.

The best super hero game out there!  The theme is done perfect, with the cartoony artwork and comic snippets. Great for any number of players (including solo), love the pre-set up decks (so there's little worry about set up or tear down), and a huge amount of variation. And the game can go great or sour at the draw of a card, so you're always kept on the edge of your seat.

I love the concept, the team work and the general play but the upkeep was a bit to much and the choices were never really tough.  What makes the game challenging is the circumstances you sometimes end up in without any cards that can really help you save the day.

The heroes, villains, and environments are extremely varied and fit within a ton of easily recognizable tropes.

Quite a bit of variance, so some games can be decided on the shuffle. Some of the "reset" cards are too swingy. There are few too many turns spent doing nothing of real interest. I'm very disappointed at having to find "the right" set of heroes for each villain, yet it seems necessary for some.

But overall, a fun game with a fun theme, and not just an experience game. The designers have done a good job taking a simple mechanical framework and adding clever thematic flourishes. I wish the decisions were a bit harder, but...it's a comic book game that I play with my kids. Well done.

This game has everything a real superhero game needs, very different powers, cross-character combos and self-sacrifice.
It is fiddly, but some fan-made ways to track health helps it a lot, and I personally don't mind the fiddliness, when moving those counters feels like a matter of life and death.
I also really love that I don't get a game that has popular superheroes pasted on, instead I get a new universe where I get to know everything through the game.

A superb game and the best Superhero game I have ever played! I've only played it alone a couple of times and used 3 heroes at the same time to simulate other players since I just got it and alone. Having played it a couple of times, I can clearly see the amount of replay ability I'm going to get of this game. It is insanely massive! The rulebook that is included with the game also talks about varying difficulty levels of levels and it is no joke. Going from a level difficulty of 1 villain to a 3(4 being the highest) was quite the leap and had me on my toes. All in all, go out and get it, I promise you won't regret it!

Wow this is a bad game.  Generic super hero rip off.  No way to keep track of the 100 hits each villain takes?  Come on.  Can't ever seen this getting to the table again.  I just don't understand all the glowing reviews on this game.  I've read comics since I was kid, this doesn't feel anything like comics.  The artwork is just bad - it looks like a high school art student did it.  Reminds me of bad 80's comic art work.

I think this is the best 'super hero' simulation in board gaming hands down.

The super heros are varied in their abilities and the enemies are challenging and varied as well. The environments that change with each game also lend to the replayability as well as adding another element of challenge or fortune to your stance in taking down the enemey.

It is a close as I have come to portraying a super-hero working with other heros to win against a common enemy. this is not a 'tacked-on' theme.  There is no 'deckbuilding' here. It is simply a deck of cards custom designed for each hero. But knowing your cards, (or hero I should say), is important in knowing what to play and when.

"Legendary" and "DC Comics" deckbuilders, though fun to play, are not really affording you the opportunity to 'play' AS a super hero. In those games you are merely playing WITH super heroes.
 
"Sentinals" is THE super-hero card game. Period.

This is a good co-op and solo game. I bring a few decks on business trips and play in my hotel room. The trick is getting a matchup that isn't too unbalanced in favor or against you. Every new combination is an experiment. I haven't unlocked the strategy that some players claim, and find that whatever characters and environment you select determine the course of the game more than any decisions made during the game.

Fun, but quite a bit of bookkeeping.

Update: rating it higher now.  Despite the fairly long playing time, and the bookkeeping (which isn't hard, just a wee bit annoying), and the artwork which really isn't my thing, I really like the theme and the way each hero plays differently.  There isn't a great deal of depth in the gameplay, but there's enough of it to keep things fun.

Update: I'm getting pretty annoyed with the bookkeeping.  I still like the game, but am rating it a bit lower now.

Sometimes, just for a second, I'll accidentally have fun playing a terrible game. There's no chance that will happen in [i]Sentinels of the Multiverse[/i].

The game is positively geriatric in its pacing, as every second of play involves someone reading fourteen lines of villain, environment, or hero card text to the group.  Rarely are the card effects very interesting, either, as most revolve around statistical modifiers, card draws, or random unpreventable damage.

It's what I imagine a book club meeting would be like if no one bothered to read the assigned book ahead of time, and the attendees decided that it would be a good idea to read the full body of text out loud.  You know, for fun.

Also, I was livid when I discovered that I wasn't allowed to exit the game when my superhero was incapacitated.  After being knocked out, I was forced to twitch dully on the sidewalk and perform actions that did nothing to substantially move the game forward.  By all that is holy, JUST LET ME DIE ALREADY.

This strong superhero theme game is a 5 player coop beat'em up that requires some thinking to take down the big boss. Unfortunately, the strategy is mostly all pregame planning for team synergy, followed by limited choices and endless deck-digging.  The game boils down to luck-based teamwork, suffering though long wait times between turns, and dealing with complex rules and actions brought upon by the AI deck.  Friends make this game fun, otherwise it's just frustrating.

I have played both multiplayer and solo.

I love this game.
 It hits all of the right notes that my superhero comics did when I was a kid.
 And, the variety is amazing. There are full, partial, and mini expansions that keep you going without feeling like someone is just trying to do "a money grab" from you, and feel like you HAVE to get them. They are optional.
 But, they actually make you wonder how they could possibly keep thinking up all of these new things, and why other companies can't do it too.

 I have played 5 and 2 player, as well as solo and love every bit. I do agree that solo can be a little confusing at first, but once you get a better feeling for the character powers, it all falls right into place.

 If you are into superheroes, you will be hard pressed to find something better!

Just got it. Looking forward to playing the heck out of it. 

Update 2013:
Oh man this is a really good co-op game. Love the theme and its pretty straight forward.

Update 2014 (up 1 point):
Still a great game and the expansions just make it better. Great with a group, but I also like it solo.

Update 2016
Still fun, but other card games are getting more plays. Fun, but back down to eight.

My wife got me this game, and I wasn't sold on it. But I played it, and played it again and again. You get the idea. It's much deeper than people will lead on, and bad card players will tank the game. Highly recommend.

Not really my style of game.. though good game, love the art work. Very unpredictable as there is many variables that can arise. One thing I don't like though is trying to keep track of all the cards in plays effects. Easy to miss card actions.

We also own the following promo characters: 
* America's Greatest Legacy
* Dark Watch Expatriette
* Dark Watch Nightmist
* G.I. Bunker
* Rogue Agent K.N.Y.F.E

We enjoy SotM a good deal; if only it were a wee less fiddly, then it would be perfect! As it is, it's so close to the perfect superhero game. All the book-keeping and moving cards around knocks it down some.

Gonna need more plays to pinpoint this one. Seems simple enough, play stuff draw stuff. I think I was playing one of the easier characters (Tachyon) so for me the whole game was just smack the obvious target, make the team draw cards. Very easy decisions. Wasn't paying too much attention to the rest of the heroes because it was my first game and nobody likes quarterbacking anyway. Could have a lot going on, with the rotating lineup of heroes, locations, and villains. Open to more games.

Many people I've played this with seem to confuse it with deck building games (D.C. & Legendary, for example). This is a deck-based, PvE co-op. It can play fairly quick, although most times I've played can be long. I had to "house-bend" some rules to keep gameplay swift and smooth.

I can sort of understand why people like it but I don't understand why they like it so much. It's the most fiddly game I've ever played, the variety within each deck is too small and the game moves far too slow for what it is.

I'm a fan of comic books and superheroes, especially the Marvel titles of the early 80s. I am also a huge fan of cooperative games. I now feel silly for holding off on purchasing Sentinels of the Multiverse based on the vanity that I didn't like its art (something that is definitely no longer the case). However, I took the chance based on what sounded like a very good game system with lots of built in variety in the many combinations of Heroes, Villains, and Environments.

The game has blown me away! I'm even a fan of the artwork now. The best part is how much it feels like a superhero game, it simulates the clash between a team of superheroes and an evil, megalomaniac villain in style! The very simple to teach base mechanisms are augmented by some great rules-breaking card combos, and a gameplay akin to the best CCGs out there. Each Hero is truly unique, and they have captured the essence of them wonderfully in how each one plays completely differently from one another.

You end up with widely different feeling plays based on which combination of Heroes, Villains, and Environments you select. This is a game with a ton of replay value. If you add in the expansions, you'll have enough game here to last a lifetime.

The one drawback is that the game isn't balanced in the way that you can easily deduce how to adjust the difficulty level. Yes, they now rate the difficulty level of each Hero, and Villain, but in combination with the Environment and each other, it's still hard to foresee how tough a fight you have setup.

I'm very enamored with this game, and it crept its way up to a 10 rating!

My favorite superheroes game used to be the PC game Freedom Force, but Sentinels of the Multiverse surpasses it. Although, I'd love to see a Sentinels of the Multiverse version of Freedom Force.

Love this game. It's super fun and a challenge. As soon as you start to go easy mode on the baddies play with the advanced rules! My only complaint about this is that I bought it and didn't know about the enhanced version coming out. I'd normally rate this an 8 but I feel disgruntled about the Enhanced version coming out the same week I purchased this. So it gets a lower score.

Very nice cooperative card game! Quite difficult (we have been brutally crashed by the game every time), but it is still entertaining. The only critic is that I would have liked more different cards in the hero's decks: sometimes you end up playing always the same 2 cards... Nevertheless, the game offers a lot of variety and hopefully one day I will be able to defeat Baron Blade..

RATING: 3
Game seemed incredibly biased towards the villain.  In both games, we seemed to take way more damage than we could have possibly given back, not to mention not being able to draw or play cards or use powers much of the time.  Nobody remotely enjoyed this.  Too much repetition in the cards, especially the environment ones.  Too few choices and actions on your turn.  Little strategy.  Baffled about the ratings for this game.

I've read online multiple times how to play this and may need to watch videos. I've played it 5 times and for all it's shiny appeal, I don't think I am the target audience for this game. I am most probably playing it wrong because things are either too easy or too hard. Great theme, great character concepts for heroes and villains, I have felt immersed in the experience. All in all a great game, but not the experience I am looking for.

I can't seem to get on well with co-ops. This one is no exception. My gaming buddy who bought it loves it, and he's always pushing to play it. I think the biggest part of the fun comes from the theme itself (he is a huge fan of comic book super-heroes).

Judging by the fact that the only co-op that I really enjoy is Hanabi, I should probably propose to make some restrictions on communications between players.

Maybe not the best design, but the large amount of great heroes, villains and environments plus the rich superhero theme make this game shine. Great replayability as all the characters seem quite different with each other resulting in endless and enjoyable combinations!

RATING: 10
Remarkably fun.  I can tell already I'm going to need more villains though.  Initial hero mix is fine for replayability, but only four villains and locations will get stale.  That's why they make expansions though!

Near endless replay value with all the expansions added in.  If you're a superhero/comic fan, this is the game you should buy.  I have DC, Legendary, and Sentinels, and the two "true" comic book card games will probably never hit the table again.  Sentinels is that good.

Super fun (no pun) and pretty replayable. It feels pretty easy as a game, right up until you feel like you can't possibly lose...then the villian and/or environment remind you how fragile your 'win' really is. Great game to play with 3 or more players - less is still fun, but not AS exciting, somehow.

This has to be the coolest looking card game of all time. You have to love super heroes and comic book artwork - but I don't read comics and I LOVE the feel of this game. It's much more than a card game, it's a thematic battle to the death between original super heroes and a super villain. You've never heard of any of them, but you'll get to know them well with multiple plays. It has an RPG/action/adventure feel and with just a tiny bit of imagination you'll see the set pieces going off in your mind. HIGHLY recommended.

This game is very fiddly. It has a lot of moving parts and a lot of things to keep track of, and the reminder tokens don't always cut it. However, it is the most thematic super heroes game I have seen and it is an absolute blast to play. I recommend this for anyone who likes super heroes, as long as they can handle the moving parts. Each hero feels unique, each villain is a different experience, and the environments are just wonderful fun.

I looked at this game for at least six months, maybe more, but the artwork prevented me from taking the plunge and buying it.  Yet, it continued to call to me, so I finally bought it.  I'm glad I did; I really love playing this solo with three heroes!  The artwork is...growing on me.  I mean, it's not horrible; it's just a little too lazy at times.  Yes, I know all the artwork is done by one guy, and that's definitely worth noting and laudable; however, all the artwork for Dungeoneer was done by one guy (Thomas Denmark), and it's entirely fantastic.  

Nevertheless, the artwork is okay, and the gameplay is a great deal of fun.  I'm glad I finally own this game!

UPDATE:  I don't know what happened, but now I love the artwork of this game, lol!  I have all of the expansions and most of the promo cards, and this game continues to ascend my list of favorites.

RATING: 6.5
A lot of variety in one box, but no customisation of decks, and each deck not having that many unique cards, it's failed to blow my socks off thus far. Also, with certain numbers, some villains are WAY too hard, and others are WAY too easy. I admire the way they have tried to balance out different player numbers, but in my experience it's rarely worked.
Love the comic book style though.

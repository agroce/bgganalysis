A solid, streamlined card game version of Sherriff of Nottingham with a prohibition theme that reminds me of that show, "Boardwalk Empire". You spend the game smuggling alcohol and legit goods passed the authorities. Sometimes you succeed. Sometimes you take a bribe. Sometimes you get busted. Good times.

Compares quite poorly to Sheriff of Nottingham. With so few police cards, and police cards allowing players to only see part of the convey, smuggling is not very hard to pull off.

Without having played Sheriff of Nottingham that people like comparing it to, I'm going to say a more involved variant of Cockroach Poker instead. And similarly to how Prohis seems to be a simpler, shorter Sheriff of Nottingham, Cockroach Poker is the simpler, shorter version of Prohis. It's a fun pure bluffing game but still feels a little more involved than it needs to be.

Prohis is a pretty interesting bluffing game.  I like that players can bribe their way through and get a nice collection.  The game depends heavily on table talk and if you're in the wrong group, it's not going to play out the right way.  It's also rather dependent on player count and playing at less than 4 is a no-no.  Pretty good game.

Call it Robin Hood because Prohis had made a fool out of the Sheriff of Nottingham. I'm just going to defer to myself last year when I said:


Things that Prohis does better: 
- It takes out the overcomplication of various types of goods that are pretty much on there for theme by making each good one of three things: legal goods (worth $1k in your warehouse), illegal goods ($4k in your warehouse, -$4k in your hand), and inspectors (ranging value based on strength. 
- The challenge process is substantially better. When someone tries to ship to their warehouse, each player bids on whether or not they want to inspect that shipment. You start the game with an equal number of inspectors with 1, 2, or 3 stars. The player to bid their highest inspector inspects that shipment, flipping over as many cards as stars on their inspector. If they hit contraband, they take the entire shipment, adding it to their warehouse. If they don't, they have to give their inspector to the other player. You can also bribe someone not to inspect you or bluff by saying "go ahead". I like this process better because everyone participates in the challenge process, and you have more options.
- I like the scoring better. I think there's too much randomness in Sheriff of Nottingham that's eliminated in Prohis because a) you can choose to draw face up cards or take off of the pile and b) scoring is consistent across legal vs nonlegal goods.

In the right group this can be great, it's a quick bluffing game that doesn't outstay its welcome. Could be more developed, there could be more different goods than just legal/illegal. If there are no cops left in the endgame it can become a little anti-climatic.

Great bluffing game. Player dynamic can influence the game a lot! Bribing is powerful! So suggest it and accept! You get money + you get your inspection card back. Which in the first game we ran out of and so illegal goods were smuggled at the very end.

Simple and fast bluffing game - and that's exactly what I enjoy in games of this genre. It never overstays its welcome and even if you're doing badly, you'll have a chance to take revenge soon enough. The concept is simple, but the gameplay fun and tense. There's also some strategy involved - should I stick to that controller or put him in a convoy? Should I accept a bribe to keep him? Many funny moments, and you don't need lenghty rules for that! Just keep it simple and engaging and everyone will have fun.

A small caveat - there is a bunch of little rules ("special case" type of thing) that you need to memorize (or use the help cards). A bit annoying when you play for the first time, but after a few plays it shouldn't be an issue.

For better or worse, Prohis is a scaled down version of [thing=157969][/thing]. You are still required to stash away goods – legal or otherwise – while using bluffs and bribes to get your way. What's markedly different about Prohis is that it is a lot more constrained; the scoring system is a lot simpler, and the right to investigate is now earned through a once-round bid.

Sometimes the constraints are frustrating, especially when you lose a scarce officer due to a bad gamble. The lack of materials to bribe with also tones down the wheeling and dealing. But Prohis makes up for its shortcomings by being quicker, cheaper and smaller. There is a clever dynamic at work in its convoy system as well, as convoys may not necessarily be searched entirely and can even be booby-trapped. 

Despite its flaws, Prohis is a fairly entertaining game of bluff when considered in its own right. Personally, I'd give it a [i]slight[/i] edge over Sheriff as it delivers a similar-enough feel in a more convenient package.

1 play, 3er

It's a bluffing game of sorts, and I lost interest very soon after starting -- glad when it ended shortly! There were so few police cards that, after we used a few in the beginning, we were mostly just playing our cards out! It's probably better with the variant where you can get used cops back into your hand. Or with repeat play, where we use cops less often? Still, this is NOT for me! I don't tend to like this style of game.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The deck is a mix of $1000 legal cards (mostly), some $4000 contraband, and a few 1* police. Players start with 4 random cards and 2 police (a 3* and a 2*). 4 cards from the deck are in a face up display. On your turn, either draw cards (2 face up, 1 face up, 1 up and 1 down, or 1 down; hand limit = 8) or play a convoy of 2-4 cards face down. If playing a convoy, other players may play a police card to inspect; if multiple players try, the one with most *s wins opportunity (ties broken by speed of play). You can offer bribes (cards in hand) to have inspector skip inspection: if he takes bribe, score your convoy and he scores police(?). If not, he can pass and just score his police card, or flip over as many cards as he has *s. Flip one by one: if find contraband, he scores entire convoy. If find police, you score contraband and take his police into your hand. Score = collect cards to your score pile.

The game ends when the deck is empty and there are fewer than 4 cards on display; most money in score pile wins.

---------------
Best for: people that like the Sheriff of Nottingham but want a better game. Instead of describing it, I'll go into why it's much better than Sheriff of Nottingham.

Things they both have: secret hands, trying to collect items to maximize points, and a mix of contraband and legal goods.

Things that I don't like about Sheriff of Nottingham: favoritism that comes out and the way that metagaming and friendships can influence gameplay. I also don't like one person being the one calling bullshit each turn instead of everyone being able to.

Things that Prohis does better:
- It takes out the overcomplication of various types of goods that are pretty much on there for theme by making each good one of three things: legal goods (worth $1k in your warehouse), illegal goods ($4k in your warehouse, -$4k in your hand), and inspectors (ranging value based on strength.
- The challenge process is substantially better. When someone tries to ship to their warehouse, each player bids on whether or not they want to inspect that shipment. You start the game with an equal number of inspectors with 1, 2, or 3 stars. The player to bid their highest inspector inspects that shipment, flipping over as many cards as stars on their inspector. If they hit contraband, they take the entire shipment, adding it to their warehouse. If they don't, they have to give their inspector to the other player. You can also bribe someone not to inspect you or bluff by saying "go ahead". I like this process better because everyone participates in the challenge process, and you have more options.
- I like the scoring better. I think there's too much randomness in Sheriff of Nottingham that's eliminated in Prohis because a) you can choose to draw face up cards or take off of the pile and b) scoring is consistent across legal vs nonlegal goods.

TL;DR: Prohis is a stripped down version of Sheriff of Nottingham that focuses on the parts that I like best (bluffing and hand management) without the overcomplicated thematic frills that just make the game more random.

Far worse at executing the concept than Sheriff of Nottingham.  Bribes are a lot less fluid and interesting because of the limited types and options.

The very limited number of 2 and 3-star feds make for a pretty awkward and swingy dynamic, and 3-stars have simply too much power.  It's also pretty random who has access to the 1-stars, which are easily the best card you can draw.

Overall feels a bit like a prototype of a Nottingham card game - still has that same bribe/smuggling sort of feel, but not really polished into a strong end product.

RATING: 6.5
Like most games that feature negotiation and bluffing, this requires a group willing to get into it.  I played it with one group and it hardly felt like a game, everyone was getting caught every time they sent a convoy out, no one ever negotiated.  Played with another group and people were scared to inspect and others were taking bribes often and was a much more enjoyable experience.

I like that this is a simpler, easier to transport version of Sheriff of Nottingham.  It's the same feel in a simpler package.

Very fun game (played with the correct people, at least) where you try to smuggle illegal items by mixing them with legal ones and avoiding controls, maybe corrupting officials. Nice idea, nice implementation, fast and enjoyable. Maybe a bit repetitive but probably always fun if people are prone to acting and interpreting their roles.
Nice!

Prohis could've replaced the need to own Sheriff of Nottingham, bu tthe odd card size and lack of eagerness by the Blackrock Editions' sales staff caused me to pass on buying the game at SPIEL '14.

I enjoy the bluffing elements, the bribing, and how cops outrank each other and are passed around from player to player. Great fun.

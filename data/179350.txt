Very unique mechanics and decisions require guessing whether you can beat the other players to the action you want to take. Thinky and somewhat AP prone. Physical quality is very good but some of the components don't work well (disks instead of cubes for resources that don't fit well on the board, piles of construction tiles that are tiny and difficult to stack). There's also a shortage of coins in a 4 player game. It is a beautiful game, though. Whether you like it or not depends on your acceptance of unique mechanics and brain burniness.

Game is hard to understand, and the rulebook is not helpfull at all. I still do have questions. It also is very unforgiving. One mistake in planing can cost you many points. Resources are tight, but we never run out of them (I played fee only 2p games). Suprisingly final score was very close, like 2-5 poins difference. And it's one of priettiest games I own. I will not play it very often, but it definitly stays in my colection

First Play: All 1st timers and as an overview this is a clever game with some tricky decisions. However after this one play I must flag some significant issues;

The game has a brutal fragility. Its possible to make well meaning mistakes in the early turns and be completely screwed for the rest of the game. There needs to be some warning advice for first timers namely, ensure you don't run out of cubes between turns, at the start buy the cheap single resource builds and try to score the short lighthouses first. If you get your cubes stranded on the board you are dead in the water.
The mechanism to restrict cubes has been used in quite a few games and is a useful throttle for turn options. However in Bretagne this mechanic seems to misfire somewhat as with cubes locked in a lighthouse some turns can be extremely limited/ brief. Whilst its possible to cross trade money for resources and cards for money you need to use cubes to gain these options which limits supply even more. A lighthouse being completed unexpectedly by player A might return 6+ cubes to another  player that they weren't expecting that enables their following turn to fire on all cylinders whereas they anticipated a subdued turn. All players need to be of similar experience to avoid these situations.
Despite a piece of self congratulation about the clarity of the rules by the designers, we must disagree. Many rules are ambiguous and clarification is hard to find.
Componant wise, these are too few Engineers and only about 50% of the coins needed to play are provided. We had to sub in the food tokens from Agricola to ensure there was enough coinage. This is a shameful oversight.
The board layout is cramped in the center making the layout of pieces very fiddly. The design and layout could be much better.
Colour separation between the dashed blue lines and the blue sea is near impossible to differentiate with less than 500 lux lighting. 80 point colour separation is needed not 10 point.

The first game must be written off to a learning experience and we all agreed that we would like to play again. Whether or not this happens when there are so many other games available in the build -worker placement genre we wait to see. Overall I can't help but see this as a missed opportunity at this stage.

A very tactical and fiddly game with a unique theme. It is essentially a turn to turn resource management game. I would have preferred more long term strategy elements, but for what it is it works well. The components are fiddly, but the rules are clear and the gameplay was smooth for us in a 2 player game. Update: Sold the game because it wasn't getting to the table and we weren't that excited to play it again.

Bretagne is a worker placement game in which players must build lighthouses on the coast of Bretagne in the 19th century.  On each turn, players take actions, such as using resources to build; trading resources, cards or money; or hiring workers or engineers.

Owned it, played it, left me with a mixed feeling.

Interesting majority mechanics and beautiful artwork and theme. Love Bretagne.

Middle weight Euro but it does most things right.  Scales well and doesn't wear out its welcome.  Components look good.  A resource management game so the optimization is fun.  Not solitaire since you are building on the same lighthouses and vying for control of them for scoring.  Did not disappoint!

Enjoy the theme. I liked the resource management. There is always something to do on your turn. You have to plan ahead but also have a backup plan. I found the rulebook worked just fine. I watched a run through, read the rules and then created an outline. I didn't have to go back and reference anything after playing.

This could be a REALLY good game, but there are two major flaws:
- Not enough coins and engineers for a 4-player game /this really sucks)
- It has a tendency to drag on a bit too much. A 3-player will take over 3 hours and I'm avoiding 4-player games, both due to this, as well as the critical lack of components.

4 player game took too long (2+ hours of playing time).  The problem for me is that the market actions can take awhile as people figure out how to translate their current resources into new resources.    

Interesting theme.   Maybe a bit more development would have streamlined it to be in my sweet spot...

Might play again with 3.

The quality of the components is quite nice, but there are way too few of them; we run out of everything in our first 3 player game! I also don't like the glossy finish of the tiles. Also, the difference between both sides of the tiles could have been bigger. It's not a real issue, but it's difficult to discern at first sight.

It's a textbook medium euro. It's a solid worker placement game with nothing new/original, but where everthing works OK.

It might be a good game, but I did not enjoy it very much. It's way too long for a standard euro, and I didn't like the mechanic for building lighthouses. Usually the one who gets the majority is the one that builds the last stage, and this is something you can't plan, you build the last stage just because the previous player built the previous one. This is just an example, there are other blind/random decisions/events and that's something that doesn't sit well with me for such a dense and long game.

Gioco strategico ben pensato e lineare. Si lascia giocare volentieri e non presenta particolari dubbi interpretativi. Personalmente non ho trovato particolare originalità e forse anche le azioni alla lunga mi sono parse un po' ripetitive. La cosa che più mi è rimasta impressa sono le immagini dei fari sul lato 'completati' che sono veramente spettacolari e sono delle piccole opere d'arte. Anche i materiali sono buoni e funzionali. Il resto del gioco più che sufficiente

Took a while to track this down for some reason.  I thought maybe because it was new, but it shows a release date of last year.  Cool Stuff doesn't even have a listing for it and neither does Miniature Market.  On Amazon it comes up on search, but it shows a different game (Florenza second edition)...weird.

OK game, were it certainly helps if you've played it before. The key is to built together and still take enough advantage as building a lighthouse completely on your own is very, very hard. And you certainly want those cubes as an income!

This is an intense game of building lighthouses. Essentially, players go through a resource collection phase, then they build a level of one of the many lighthouses, and get rewards and score points depending on how much they spent on building that level. The magic of the game comes from the three majorities that take place when a lighthouse is completed at the end of the round. First you play scoring cards, and for each card you play, you remove a cube. The cards get less valuable for each previously placed card of that type, so whomever has the initial majority goes first. Then players can remove a cube to get into an income spot. THEN you do final majority scoring for bonus points. The game has that element that really interests me where opponents have to work together to further their goals. It also has a minor engine building element that seems very subtle, but over investing in them can mean that you don't have the cubes you need to score points. The game really needs twice the number of components it comes with, as nearly everything runs out at some point, and you absolutely need to download a re-written rulebook from bgg as the one it comes with isn't nearly sufficient..

tl;dr: good strategy game!

This is one of those games that got great responses at Spiel 2015, but it wasn't actually available until a while later. But I finally got to try it. And I must say: this is a very solid game. There are few things you learn on your first play that will improve your score in the next games, but overall rules complexity is average and the icons are quite clear, so there isn't too much of a learning curve.
I quite enjoyed this and look forward to trying it more.

Very interesting game where timing is everything.  Worker availability is really tight.  It seems vital to correctly assess what the other players want/need to do or you run the risk of stranding your workers on an uncompleted lighthouse.  The 3 worker majority scorings for completed lighthouses is a great twist on the standard area control mechanic.  Do you score quick points by pulling your workers and being able to reuse them or do you leave them there to score bigger points later in the game?  I found that there was a dance for positioning by spending turns trading so that you could be the one to finish the lighthouses and have a better chance of winning the majorities.  Looking forward to more plays to explore this more.

It's a area majority game with resource management at its heart. Players need to collect resources to build lighthouses around the area (different areas have different difficulty levels based on the wave or current of the ocean).
It's quite challenging because the game is tight and players left with hard decisions throughout the game.
I found the area majority scoring to be unique like no other, it's a multi-leveled area majority that happens each round based on each completed lighthouse.

Worker placement, goods conversion to erect and outfit lighthouses off the north west coast of France. Setup varying difficulty lighthouses that can be constructed with simple or complex lighthouse components using resources, engineers and workers. The signature strategy of this game is; choosing barges with different stowage and bonuses and all players can build a level of any lighthouse. Finite supply of workers influences decisions on commitment to a lighthouse project. Go for simple components and invest in several lighthouses or build complex components for more points and extras. Unique element to send workers from completed lighthouses to work the docks for starting resources each turn.

Purchased in far-year of 2007. At the beginning we had some difficulty entering the convuluted game system. 
After three sessions We left it with the feeling that we do not take all their juice and enjoyment of this Title .... but there were other games to play Around.

2015.01: My game buddy and I decided to invest more seriously in this title. After reviewing the whooping sequence of play and clarify the doubts regarding the movements of armies (Force march-mud)and diplomatic issues, the game stems nicely and in easy way.
This is an excellent and unique STRATEGIC game in which you can play all of the Napoleonic Wars in 2-4 hours.
Despite the apparent simplicity of the rules, it's not an easy game and requires a good deal of investment in rules translation on the part of the players so that both can enjoy a fantastic Napoleonic experience.
The design is clear and after the natural questions in the first game the campaign runs smoothly.

The designer deserves the congratulations for having managed to encapsulate impeccably this rich period both the military as diplomatic aspects of this age in a very fun and addictive game.

Playing now intenssely with two diferente opponents. This game is just Great!
A Masterpiece. 
Each session is totttaly diferent from the previously one.
Fantastic and clever design with great napoleonic flavour.
A lot of strategies and possiblities for both sides in each game.

Playing time 1805-1815: Around 3-5 hours

Wow.  All of the good comments and Mayfair's quality should have spelled an auto-hit for me, but this was a huge disappointment.

It felt like a big game of whac-a-mole.  Army pops up.  Napoleon beats it down.  If you are the Allies, you hope for a good card and if not, you just kind of do nothing for the year.

I admit I don't know a lot of details of this campaign, so take it with a grain of salt.  Someone far more knowledgeable than me said that's kind of how the Napoleonic Wars were.  So if that's your thing, knock yourself out.  Me?  I thought it was a boring gaming experience.  I'd rather watch a documentary.

Like I said, that's me.  Maybe you dig that.  That's cool.  The mechanics were interesting, I will admit.  The game is beautiful.  The game is not overly-complex, but the rules...suck.  I'm sorry, but there's no way around it.  I downloaded the 2nd edition.  They sucked, also.  I have both of Renaud Verlaque's games (Price of Freedom being the other).  He has good ideas, but he doesn't explain them well.  If he wrote directions on how to get from my front door to the mailbox, I would end up in Nebraska (and I live in Kansas).  This game is begging for an eloquent fan to explain how to play it.

But that's just me.  Even if Volko Ruhnke (the best rulebook writer in the business) himself were to re-write this rulebook, I would have no desire to play this.  Sure, I would understand how to play it, but it goes back to the realization that I'm not into strategic level Napoleonic games.  People who dig the topic seem to think the 2nd edition rules are serviceable and seem to love it, so if that's your thing, look into this.  If you are casual gamer, I would suggest running fast and far away.

My first impressions are very good - I have printed out the v2 rules (see the files link http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/25429/aon-v2-main-rules-published-version-pdf) and have been learning and playing these.
Overall, the rules are subtle and require a bit of reading, but the mechanics flow well and the card-driven system adds a really strong dimension to the game.

Juego ágil en el que destaca la eliminación definitiva de las unidades, con lo que no pueden ser reconstruidas.
Cada unidad militar representa un cuerpo de ejército y a su comandante integrado, lo que favorece el que no haya demasiadas fichas apiladas.
El diseñador ha subido unas instrucciones para jugar sin cartas que ayudan a disputar una partida en solitario.

Pretty much a perfect VFM combination. The components are excellent and streets ahead of any other Napoleon era game I've ever played. It manages to a be playable strategic two player game on the period. Be warned that the diplomacy cards can swing the game balance but if you don't like a little FoW this is probably not the game for you.

Reasonable attempt to cover the Napoleonic Wars. Great art work too. It has very nice elements like winter/march attrition and permanent/temporary corps losses.

However AoN is a bit too flat of tone to my wargaming taste. Most action goes over the Denmark-Italy axis. And the diplomatic (and some other) cards makes the storyline a bit too fluctuating. But that can be OK. Take the game as it is and have fun.

I have the feeling that a much better game with more strategic choices could have been produced. I miss fleets for instance and more intelligent cards, storyline and deployment system. Now let Napoleon sit in Champagne (drinking brandy) like a spider in his web waiting the events to come. Not so elegant are the different card playing phases and I do not see why the french have the inititive till 1810 and the coalition from then onwards. This should depend on the game situation!

Critisism on components: too big flagmarkers, flags and insurrection markers could have been combined, British flag for the coalition is a bit confusing, minor country corps should have been drawn with more distinction.

I have played only one partial game. The game is interesting and about the right weight for me but there were some issues with massive amounts of errata in the rulebook. I might consider buying this if the rulebook was fixed. Very beautiful parts and board.
EDIT: Now I have played a full game. Very nice components. Simple rules (for a wargame). Seems to be very luck driven, but I'm not sure yet. Rating changed from 6 to 7.

There may not be another game more like marriage than this. It's stunningly beautiful. It takes a real commitment.  It's as unpredictable as it is complex. It's got wild swings of emotion, both pleasure and pain. Yet if you put the time in, and work at it, it can be extremely satisfying. So the question is, "Do you love me?".  Answer:  I respect you, and it's been fun - but I'm not sure I can go on like this with so many other fish in the sea. If it makes you feel any better, know that you will always have a piece of my heart!

Good game played on a slightly a-historical map of Europe, especially on its eastern parts. The Austro-Hungarians have never reached the Black Sea in their entire history. Ever! I am ok with the possibility of this event happening throughout game play (as an "what if?"), but not as starting pre-setup drawn on the map itself. To me that's just a sore in the eye. Alternative history maybe, alternative geography, a definitive NO!

Initial Impression: The production values for this game are some of the best I've ever seen. The game itself takes a grand scope look at the Napoleonic era. Although the game doesn't feel scripted, it seems as if it generally follows historical events through the use of the cards. The cards can be very powerful, especially the diplomatic events, but overall I will cautiously state that it seems well balanced. I believe that it will take a number of plays to determine the validity of the statement.

after 12 plays : A blast to play. A REAL strategic wargame and NO Euro clone. Downloading the Living Rules is a must.
The game gives you a VERY accurate historical feeling.

The French need to crush the opponents on the battlefields, year after year after year (just to drain the Allied armies AND their diplomatic initiatives). JUST like 1805-1812 ! It's frustating to conquer countries with mass armies, and still see the diplomatic efforts ruin all those hard fought gains. Those who give the game a low score because of the power of the diplomcy (cards), just don't know the period the game tries to simulate.

The Allies (under the umbrella of Britain) need to gain time and stay in the diplomatic game. IF they still can muster enough cards each year, they will come back after the 1811/13 crucial years, IF they still have the manpower to equip the necessary armies.

France killed everyone on the battlefields from 1805 to 1809, but Napoleon could NOT win the battle against the old monarchs and their overwhelming diplomatic (cards) game.

The more I play this thing the better it gets. No two games are the same.
What a game. The complete Napoleonic war era 1805-1815 for 2 players in 5 hours.

Another beautiful looking game from Phalanx but unfortunately, the rules are impossible to grasp.

Update: Finally starting to understand the revised edition rules after hours of study. Raising my rating a bit but I still have a ways to go.

Update: After more study and several play sessions, the rating now holds. The game seems fun but it just isn't worth the rules overhead.

Tentative Rating:  I'm going to have to try this again.  I like the diplomacy and cardplay element of the game, but am not in love with the victory conditions.  UPDATE: Verdict is still out.  I can't really tell if I like this game or not since I can't tell if I'm playing it right or not.  The rules are really, really poorly written and make every single moment in the game feel like an uncertainty ("Am I playing this right or not?  [check rulebook for the 10,000th time]).  UPDATE #2:  After finally getting the rules down, I determined that this game is WAY too luck driven (card play is too powerful).  It effectively negates any decent strategic planning.  Traded away.

Top notch components and gameplay, and yes Virginia, there IS a strategic level Nappy game you can finish easily in a sitting.  Near perfect, card luck might bite you, but merely play again, you will want to anyway. Fantastic value for the small amount of money and learning time required.  Great support from the designer.  Superb game for grog or beginner.  Rating went up after using latest living rules.

RATING: 6.5
2008: Despite a few loose ends in the rules, a generally quick and fun look at Nap's wars at a light strategic level.  I've played ten games with my sons, with about an even amount of wins on either side.  This game achieves what it sets out to do -- provide a light strategic Nap experience in a short time period.  

June 2013 addition:  The major issue I have, after 20 or so games, which has dropped my rating to a 6.5, is the periodically immense effect the Diplomacy cards can play in the game.  The single deck, luck of the draw crapshoot can absolutely screw one side or the other (usually the Coalition).  To my understanding, the Russ can be clawing with the French tooth and nail from 1805-13, but the French can then slap down one Dip card and just shut the Russ off to neutral?  Oh yeah, the Coal can cancel with their own Dip card, etc. But the fact is I have had at least 6 games of 20 where the card draws are such that the Coal gets few/no Dip cards, and the French get a cluster, and get either a) an early cakewalk of switching off Coal enemies, or b) a late game poison spray that also switches off what at this point should be committed, adamant Coal enemies, and limp to a victory, having "iced" 10-15 potential Coal corps into neutral or ally status.  Luck of the Draw?  Fine.  But -- just sayin'-- the fact that this happens PERIODICALLY, effectively "diplomatic nuking" the Coal in late game, is a big problem to me.  Placing this against the Allies' historical responses to Napoleon's mid/late war diplomatic entreaties (e.g. "f*() you, Nap, you're going down), the mid/late game effectiveness of these cards is way off base. 

The same can be said of the Joseph/Insurrection cards, which SHOULD have a major impact, but in my experience, are again way too subject to luck of the draw.  A "usual" Coal strategy is to play Joseph on Spain, making it subject to Insurrection, and thus putting it on a historical course.  But if the Coal never gets Joseph, I find the French can make Spain just about bullet proof by dropping one quality corps in Madrid to go along with their Spanish allies.  the Brits generally can't muster enough strength to oust the Fr/Span from Spain on their own.  Bottom line -- in well over half my games, Spain has remained a French ally to the bitter end.  Spain usually finishing the game as a French ally is another frustrating illustration of the crapshoot Diplomacy system.  

My other, pet rock level lament are the generic inf/cav/arty corps, but I understand that it would be hard to break out combat arms at this level without several paragraphs more rules (still, I think a dozen or so mini pieces for French cav corps and maybe some artillery reserves would have added just that touch more differentiation that would make the game shine).


Still, all in all, I'd take this any day over TNW.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Oh! So close to a good game. Much to like about this, the winter / force march attrition is great and makes maintaining a large army for long periods a real challenge. The core combat mechanic is fine. But... all you military endeavour is moot since the game is decided simply by who gets the most and most powerful diplomacy cards. These are hugely overpowered and since there are relatively few in the deck, every game is decided by the possession of a few key cards. A shocking design failure in my eyes.

Well, rating this game is really hard. I just love the quality components (although the map is a mess, historically) and the game amazingly recreates the period feel. On the other side, the rules are confusing and the game itself is too chaotic and dependent on the card draw to really shine. But if you're ok with that, then this might be the game for you. I have a soft spot for the game and therefore rate it a 7.5

One of the better Phalanx games, made even better with Mayfair's release of the second edition. A variation on the card-driven strategy game design which retains the strategic vs operational tension but does so without overloading the player with huge card decks most of which never see the light of day.

The result is a game that reflects most of the salient aspects of the Napoleonic era but one that can be finished in a reasonable time frame. It is important to have the latest version of the "living" rules which takes some of the quirkiness out of the diplomatic model and has resulted in my revising the game's rating sharply upwards. If you don't yet have a copy make sure you get the second edition! 

This can be a very enjoyable gaming experience for fans of the Napoleonic era but who don't care for mounds of rules and fiddlyness which too often surrounds other treatments.

With repeated play, my opinion of this game continues to slide. It's got some fun stuff, and it can be fun to play, but there is too much stuff in here that just doesn't work. Disappointed by the lack of any strategic options, but tactically interesting. The Diplomacy cards are far too powerful; an imbalance will decide the game with near-certainty.

Pretty game with rules that needed a re-write but I found it lacked the interest it had back in the days of playtesting. I don't think attrition was a particularly good model for the period and found the play for the Allies largely consisted of sitting around doing nothing and hoping for good cards. Now it could be argued that this was the way it was but it makes for bad entertainment. The wars always go full term if you play reasonably and one therefore knows in 1805 a good deal more than your historical counterpart. The cards are very prone to rule the game, but it can at least be played quickly to repair this feature. Not one that I would play again.

1 learning game, like it, learning and correcting mistakes...  I keep thinking about the game. Seems like even with the learning and correcting the rounds play fast. Lots of decisions, strategy, marches and counter-marches in the Campaign Phase, card resource mongering. Knowing the cards will help. I like the mechanics. And the mechanics like me.

By the way, Napoleon was about 5 foot 7 inches, I hear.

I bought the revised cards via Mayfare, and printed out the revised rules, scenarios, charts. I also converted the rule file to kindle format and have the robot narrator read it to me while doing the dishes.

Very nice to look at, though you'll definitely want to download a revised rule set--the first edition rules are terribly confusing and incomplete (fortunately Renaud is on BGG, and extremely helpful in answering any and all questions).

Beautifully produced, easy to manage wargame that suffers somewhat from somewhat dense rules.  Captures the flavour and pageantry of the Napoleonic era so well in addition to the logistics and difficulties of warfare at the time.   The card system is smooth, engaging, and always interesting and the combat system is elegant and extremely well thought out.  I wish that I could play it more often, but the learning curve makes it difficult to teach!

Attempted to play once but rules were terrible and confusing. We literally got stuck on turn 1 just trying to figure out basic game play.

It's never a good sign when the living rules are nearly twice the size of the rule set that shipped with the game. Seriously, how did that rule set get past development? Awful. The geography is hilariously bad as well.

Play [i]The Napoleonic Wars[/i] instead. You'll get a much better game for about the same playing time.

Quick, high-level implementation of the napoleonic wars from Moscow to Lisbon. The diplomacy rules are a little confusing at first, but thanks to being 2-player only, aren't as complex as other games on the topic. Luck plays a large role and since cards are dealt in proportion to countries you control, its hard to come back from a fall. However, it plays quickly enough to start another game when fortune fails to shine evenly.

Very enjoyable and playable treatment of the Napoleonic Wars. Much easier to get to the table then 'The Napoleonic Wars' CDG but apart from the player count it doesn't feel like you lose that much in terms of chrome and theme.

It is a bit 'dicey' - it's a single d6 roll (per player) so something really bad/good is just as likely as something average - but believeable outcomes nontheless.

A bit of a let down to be honest. I expected much more from it. The game felt quite static for some reason, you assemble your monster stack and then just wade around with it hunting smaller armies. At least that seemed like the best strategy to me. Historically correct perhaps but not much fun.

RATING: 7
Two player Napoleonic game from 1805 through to 1815.  Players play either the British or the French and attempt to woo the other major and minor powers to their side via diplomatic and military conquests.  Complexity is low, down around the We The People/Hannibal end of the scale of card driven wargames.  Fast playing, diplomacy rules that make sense, lovely components.  After a couple of games, it looks bullet-proof.  Excellent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is one of the leanest, fastest card-driven game out there. The game really hinges no the use of withdrawls and interceptions on the board, as well as opportunistic use of any diplomacy cards you receive. 
 
It succeeds in condensing a huge amount of action, diplomacy, and battle options into a very playable package. I feel like I make just as many tough decisions here as in long games like Napoleonic Wars or Hannibal. [note I'd rate it a bit harsher before diplomacy and card tweaks]

RATING: 8
Joel and I struggled our way through this game, still not sure what I think. There is some cool stuff going on with the game, but it is a complete rules mess, even in the 2nd ed.  The core ofthe game seems to be the campaign season , yet 90% of the rule book is dedicated to the rest of the game.  It seems that they have over complicated the non-essential part of the game.  This could go up after futher plays, but I am not sure I will give it another chance.

Glad I gave this game another chance.  The rules could be written better; however, the game play is sublime....well worth the effort.

I have really tried to like this game, but the couple of games I played didn't work. The game went on longer than was fun (and for comparison, I have no problem with the length of WOTR).

RATING: 6
The only luck-driven wargame I have played. 

Basically it seems to go like this: France keeps a big stack of troops in Paris and runs around Europe with Napoleon. Britain makes amphibious landings where he can to cause havoc and causes as many insurrections as he can. And if you don't get the right cards then you just don't get them and then you are done.

It has gorgeous components and in some way quite historical feel, but in the end it makes even The Napoleonic Wars look like a very orderly game.

Comments below are for 1st edition. Heard that 2nd ed. has made changes, which addressed some of the issues I mentioned below.
--------------------------------------------------
Game is visually appealing and gameplay is fast-moving and exciting for a wargame. But the cards don't allow for much varied decision-making, strategic options are limited and too much hinges on drawing the right cards at the right time, e.g. there's only 1 card the Coalition player can play to bring the Brits into battle. In the end, the game boils down far too much to luck.

Just learning the second edition and I love the game.  Perfect size, scale and playtime for me and it's very fresh and creative.  I doesn't feel like any other game I have.  I wish more wargames gave this much weight to diplomacy and its ability to influence a conflict.  Really interesting and moves great.  Love the card mix, which makes each play unique.  I should also say the production is fantastic to look at and play with.  This designer needs to strike again with another great game.

A nice game. The rules are fiddly for a such light game and it takes several plays to get them right (correction: the latest rulebook is pretty clear, print it). But it is worth it. There are lots of diffucult choices and almost every move seems to be crucial (except some winter moves). And most of all, it's a fun game and seems to capture the right feeling. Note: after some more games I have found out that I don't like the rules for victory or insurgency much. However, a nice card-driven wargame.

I've played this game three times. Unlike other card-driven wargames inspired by We the People, Age of Napoleon simplifies the card system and provides a fun game which elegantly captures the flavor of the Napoleonic wars from a strategic perspective. Like all good games, players are forced to make tough decisions and reap the rewards or penalties for taking high risks. Playing time is under five hours for the full campaign game. In my opinion, this was one of the best games to come out in 2003.

This game has superb components, and after getting a look at this game I immediately wanted to play! The counters are beautiful; the board is beautiful--what more could you want in terms of graphics? That said, the game also produces great historical narratives. Each time I play this there is a different sequence of events. 

I take off one point from the perfect 10 for a lack of truly agonizing decisions (the best option is usually clear) and another point for the somewhat-confusing rules-book. Once you have the hang of it, though, "Age" is a blast to play!

Being interested in the Napoleonic Wars (having grown up near the Waterloo battlefield in Belgium), one operational Napoleonic game is needed in my collection. Still need a serious play to decide whether to keep this or replace it (Napoleon Against Europe..?). The rules are an absolute mess, and not at all easy to grasp, & could've used a sensible rewrite (2nd edition wasn't much help). I don't like my generals lumped into the same counter as their corp units- I prefer leader counters separate from troop units (just a personal preference) since that can add more personalities to the game. Otherwise, the game does a fairly good job at presenting the Napoleonic theater- although it does kind of play itself at times, all with a beautiful map-board. 

Update: sold. Looking or waiting for something that does this better (Napoleon Against Europe?)

The rules just don't sit in my mind well. It's not that there are a lot of exceptions, like some other wargames.

RATING: 6.5
This is an interesting and not very complex game about the main period of the Napoleonic Wars (1805-15) for two players; it may be played in a 4-5 hours session.

Unfortunately the rulebook is HIGHLY unclear -including the 2nd edition, which I own-, as shown by the abundant questions and doubts posted here in BGG. The diplomacy rules are especially confusing. Thanks to the answers of the designer and several aids created by other players, the rules can be deciphered. But definitely the rulebook could be written better!

I think that the game is enjoying and, once you understand the rules, the game play is smooth and fast. Being a card-driven game with just one deck for both players, the luck in the card distribution can be decisive.

Great looking game, with excellent feel.  Lots of decisions to be made, and plenty of scope for strategy.  (Addendum) UNLESS!  Luck can be huge in this game.  We've played 3 games altogether, and in each case the player who lost felt that they could have done NOTHING differently.  When the luck goes against you, nothing can save you.  In each case the game has ended before 1911.  Once in a French decisive victory (with only 3 corps in the dead pile, ie. bloodless).  And twice in a Coalition decisive victory, with France having huge (dice roll inflicted) losses, and surrendering with barely any units left, while the coalition had full forces.

Not so good: Strategic - Napoleonic - Easy

Plus:
-Unbelievable how such complicated topic can be streamlined. This is designer brilliance.
-Fun, engaging, action filled, tense, swings of fortune.
-Great production quality
-Playable in an evening
-Replay value high

Minus:
-Uplayable with the standard rules. Living rules a must
-Accessibility. Mind you, this is not an easy game and best if explained.
-Historicity is hard but at times off track (map geography does the history do any favors either). 

If you do not have the time or players for GMT's The Napoleonic Wars', this one is an excellent and relatively quick alternative. Heavy swings of fortunes but this makes it exciting at the same time. If you think all is lost you draw a dilpomatic card which can pacify a nation. Living rules is a must. Recommended.

First time I played face to face was less than successful, we got many rules wrong and I rated it poorly as a result!

Subsequent games over Vassal have faired much better and I have upped my rating. We still get many things wrong however. Has probably the hardest rule book to digest ever. It's not long, poorly worded or complex, it's none of those things but still remains a difficult thing to internalise??

I like the game play itself, there is lots of push and shove. It has swings of fortune due to the cards, a favorable combo can be powerful. This is not necessarily a bad thing, you manage your luck with the cards by setting yourself up with a board position to best leverage opportunities you are dealt, it is a design feature much like 7 Ages.

This means the game state has to change very quickly in order to create what historically happened. Anyway, it isn't terrible, but just doesn't quite cut it. Also feels very luck dependent.

RATING: 6
Simply the best components ever for a wargame.  Also, the design by rookie Verlaque shows a lot of inspiration.  This game is probably the best simulation to date of the Napoleonic Wars, due largely to its England vs. France focus and the randomly changing diplomatic stances of the other major countries.  Too bad about the rulebook.  The living rules are an improvement if you are into that sort of thing.  The gameplay has a lot to offer in the 2-3 hours it takes to play the game, although the Talleyrand and Napoleonica cards are too powerful and drive the game.  Unfortunately, the game can have some severe narrative hiccups due to its card-driven nature and the fact that diplomacy is handled entirely by card draws.  In one game I played, Napoleon's army was virtually destroyed at Austerlitz.  Russia and Austria immediately sued for peace.  Huh?
Updated: My opinion on this game has unfortunately soured over time, due to a few key reasons:
1) The ever changing rulebook.  This is why I HATE living rules.  The latest edition I saw had a new rule that made it beneficial to the French to have areas in insurrection.
2) I am not convinced that the game system can model the rising nationalism that eventually united Europe against Napoleon.
3) The lack of 1812 and 1815 scenarios, both of which could be more interesting than the scenarios provided.

This is a fantastic card driven wargame that has grown on me with repeated plays.  The point of the game is to engineer a political imbalance in your favor to win the game.  This can be accomplished militarily and with diplomatic card play.  I think the most common novice mistake I've seen is a player focusing on beating the other sides army.  Veteran players recognize its not about pounding the other army, rather, you should generally seek battle only when necessary and as part of a plan to affect a change in the political status of a target country.  

UPDTATE: Second edition rules have improved this already good game, and address many of the criticisms raised in the first edition.

RATING: 6
Excellent quality components, rulebook easy to read but some of the rules are not clear, so I'd recommend version 2.0. and a short game to get to grips with the rules. In summary: enjoyable, relatively light card-driven wargame (and the cards really do drive the game!) It is enjoyable because it is fairly fast-paced and the strategic situation can change dynamically if one of the players is luckier with the card draw or wins a key battle or two. On the other hand, the fact that the luck of the cards can have such a major effect on the game can lead to a feeling that you are not in control. Having said this, I've generally enjoyed this aspect of the game; it is a challenge in itself to react to card-driven events. UPDATE: after a few plays Age of Napoleon is beginning to lose its shine. The diplomacy cards have too strong an effect on the outcome of the game.

I dunno about this one. The production values are incredible, and I don't mind the high luck factor, but I think the game is very confusing; I simply don't know what to do and the strategies (if there are any) are not apparent.

Finally got rid of it after 3 games. I think it was OK, but my main gaming buddy (with whom I play 2 players games) hates it to death.

A physical masterpiece.  The simplification of the Naopleonic Wars into a 2 player is brillant.  The Diplomacy phase is inspired but fails to work.  The game ends up largely determined by card draws and the wild swings of fate in the Diplomacy phase.  Its a shame.  Its an accessible, short wargame covering a great period.  Its even fun but lacking compared to other CDWGs of similiar complexity (Hannibal, We the People, etc.)

RATING: 10
My introduction to card based systems.  Very positive.  Components and map are works of art.  Rules make sense: once you ignore original rules, read living rules (many examples are still wrong), and give the game a few attempts.  Once you catch on, the genius of the game becomes apparent.  I love history, and this game accurately and simply injects the powerful influence and combination of English gold, coalition diplomacy, Napoleon's military juggernaut and concurrent political and ego vulnerabilities.  That it can do so in a game that takes only 3 hours to play 10 years is amazing.  If you like Napoleonic games and strategic depth, this is a must buy.  I do not agree with luck based criticism.  Card draws are enormously important, but even then, many choices must be made, and the right choices are not always obvious.  And in addition to being a military genius, didn't Napoleon depend on luck and fate a few too many times?  I guarantee you, when you are the French player, you will find yourself treading Napoleon's path, you will push yourself to achieve glory, and get slapped in the face with coalition diplomacy.  If you are coalition, you will watch the Grand Armee rampage through central Europe with alarm, desparately trying to resist military collapse through diplomacy.  Luck will play a big role, but how is that not historically accurate?  I LOVE THIS GAME.

RATING: 9
Excellent two-player card driven wargame on the theme of the Napoleonic Wars. It borrows a number of mechanisms from the We the People/Hannibal series of games, although it's hardly alone in doing that.

It offers colourful play and a lot of fun in a relatively quick-playing package.

Recommended.

RATING: 3
Though ostensibly a game about the Napoleonic wars, it is really more about the importance of good diplomacy in securing a Coalition victory.  Unfortunately, since diplomatic successes are linked to random card draws, this creates wild swings in board position from something completely outside of the players' control.

The military side of the game possesses a nice battle engine but the overall level of activity and what can be secured through military action often seems too little reward for the investment of time and effort.  Players are discouraged from campaigning on multiple fronts at once and Europe feels relatively confined and claustrophobic.  The ability of enormous armies of 300,000  men to avoid battle for turn after turn is also rather discouraging.

Update: after playing again, I've dropped AoN another point.  I think the culprit is the automatic withdrawal/interception - it's too much for me.  The French generals are simply too slippery for my taste.

Rules are unusually complex, requiring concentration, which takes away from the fun factor. Not for trivial war game fans, but those truly interested in the Napoleonic era.

Visually striking map and components. Some rules could be clearer, although the examples are helpful. Some of the map geography is a bit inaccurate in places (the Austrian Empire shouldn't border on the Black Sea, and Moscow is too far to the northeast). In any case, this game is fun to play.

This game has beautiful components and some good play.  The flow of the game rewards flexibility and has high replay value.  However, sometimes the game is so fluid that it can seem a bit pointless.

Played three games. Age of Napoleon feels the best wargame I've played: it's better than Hammer of the Scots or Axis & Allies (Memoir'44 is not included because it is not a 'wargame').
Phalanx Games has published a great components, rules are quite clear and best of all, you need dice very rarely. That's a good thing! Only negative detail so far is, that the scenarios might be a little bit unbalanced.

RATING: 6
[2007.May.16] Age of Napoleon (or AoN, for short) is another beautifully rendered game by Phalanx Games--despite the glaring discrepancies of the European map. Although the game attempts to focus on card management as its primary game mechanic, the overpowering effect of luck, in both die rolling and card drawing, detracts from the overall elegance of the game. This game may require a 3rd edition re-design before it finally shines. For now, however, it is only a "diamond in the rough".

Recently upgraded this to a 9. It is just a wonderful grand strategic game of the period. Diplomacy can be chaotic and those who like more control should probably stay away, but if you don't mind wild swings in diplomacy, and in my mind they give a realistic feel for this time period and add much replayability, this is a surprisingly playable and immensely fun game that can be played to conclusion in an evening.

RATING: 8
A direct competition to GMT's The Napoleonics War, with a much lighter tone but probably more effectiveness.  The game has the same card-driven mechanics for a Napoleon strategic scale game.  The use of strategy cards is subtle ( you can have a maximum 10 cards at one time in your hand) and the timing of playing them is a real key decision.  The order of play in different phases gives an initiative to the French (i.e. Napoleon) in the first half of the course of war 1806-1810 and to the Coalition the second half 1811-1815.  Very simple rule but effective.  Special features inlcude diplomatic alliance, insurrections (insurgents countries that are impervious to the French dominion), winter attritions (in effect a supply problem) and many special actions depicted by the use of cards. I begin to like this game a lot where it offers a strategic view on the Napoleonic War. Political clouds, military manoeuvers, tactical abilities, weather etc., all are reflecting the nature of the Napoleonic War, in a simple but effective and interactive manner. I never manage to play AH's "Empire in Arms". Age of Napoleon fills the gap. It is a game in which you must eye on your own objectives. It is very likely with the use of cards combo, something big would have happened. It forces you to always keep the decisive victory conditions in mind. For the French, you must always protect Ile de France with a stack of armies. Paris is always threatened by the British across the channel. A capture of the capital would be a French surrender, a Coalition decisive victory. For the Coalition, they must keep pressure on containing the expansion of the French. The decisive victory conditions (3 'ands') for the French is rather hard in my opinion. Napoleon must bring the whole of continental Europe under the French control, except Britain. It is, at the same time, more interesting to play the French. A very focused game indeed. For a fun and simple strategic scale Napoleonic game, this is the best.  A tip for reading: "Napoleon 200 years later" by Frederic Bey.  The article appears in Against the Odds magazine Nr. 19 (Not War but Murder).  From the receding knowledge about Napoleon by the French people, the author explained the soldier characters of Napoleon and his central strategy in engagement - the destruction of enemy main field force, and how this was being shaped by the nature of French open terrain.  He also talked about how wargames emancipate Napoleon's pragmatism, his organization and administration of the Grande Armee, and hence the ability to attach units into Army or detach from it with independent brigades.

A very playable simulation of the entire Napoleonic period--a rare find.  Can swing wildly back and forth depending on the card play.  Unfortunately, the map play is an afterthought.  Diplomacy (through card play) is the key to this game rather than maneuver of armies.  There are suggested house rules to correct this, but none that I've found completely satisfactory.  Kudos to the designer, who has gone out of his way to answer questions and support the game.  And the rules keep getting better and better.  Fantastic components as can be seen in the image gallery.

Based on 3 games so far. I really like this game so far. Neat and short rules plus really beatiful and high qaulity components. On the downside it seems that luck with diplomacy cards seems to have big effect. Have to play few more games and see how big the luck factor is and how much replay value there is. I guess my rating could go down to 8 or even up to 10.

Update: after 20 or so full games I have come to conclusion that there is indeed bit too much luck factor with diplomacy cards that quite often leads to imbalance, but hey it´s such a fun and short (for a wargame) that I really don´t mind.

The rules are not the clearest I've ever read, but the designer is very active in the forums and quickly answers most queries. I've only played once, but the game seems worth the effort - gorgeous components and exciting game play. After reading the rules I thought the diplomacy cards were going to be key, but they had very little effect in my first play, which resulted in a more or less straightforward slugfest between Napoleon and the assembled coalition powers.

I desperately want to love this game; but for some reason that I can't quite identify "Age of Napoleon" just doesn't engage me very well. The game design is absolutely brilliant, and I recognize that it is truly a great game. But it just doesn't work for me; perhaps it is the pace of the game, or maybe the fact that I don't feel like I have the level of control over the game action that I would like. I don't know. But it's a game that gets a 5 for me even though it really deserves at least an 8.

finally tried the game in march/2017, after reading the rules and 1st play.
the game is quite pleasant: strategy is great, the map is colourful, plenty of options.
still have to test it more. still some rules to understand better. the rulebook (2nd edition) is still hard to fully understand.
Update april/2017: after reading the rulebook for the 3rd time, I came to a conclusion: there was no effort (or they simply did not achieve) to make rules more "player friendly", on the contrary. Despite loving the theme, I lost patience for this game...

UPDATE 2: Played after a long absence from the game. Finally understood most of it, but some parts of the game still befuddle me. Look forward to playing again, but I'm not yet convinced to re-purchase it. The Diplomacy cards can be seriously wonky.

UPDATE:  Sent it to someone far more deserving.  I just figured I was really never going to want to play it again, and have lots of other 2-player games I am hungry for.

Pretty nifty, with a simple shell but complicated center. PLayed 2nd Ed., but it still seems very driven by the Event card play.  That's a bit frustrating, as you want skill and good decision making to decide events.  Actually probably a bit more fiddly than it needs to be.  Buit now that I've gamed it, I can see me breaking this out quite a bit.

Beautifully presented, with wonderful map and thick, large counters. Combat system is fairly simple and it works.  Winter attrition is nicely done. It certainly makes you feel Napoleonic. The one problem is the cards.  Some are just too powerful. Perhaps the game balance will improve once I've better understood the diplomatic side.

This game is pretty much perfect, a fast-playing, historical, two-player strategic game which is also great fun, and with a wealth of choices for both sides.  And it comes in a beautifully produced package at a very reasonable price.  If I could think of a flaw, I would list one, but I can't.  Strongly recommended.

RATING: 4
I'd love to rate this higher, since the designer obviously put in a lot of effort, and the game is nicely produced. However, all games I have played (old and new rules) resulted in one of two possible outcomes: 1. There is no insurrection until 1811 and Napoleon can claim a minor victory due to superior troops. 2. There is an insurrection before 1811 and Napoleon doesn't stand a chance.Since getting an insurrection requires no skill - you just need to draw the right card at the right time - the game holds little interest for me as is.

Edit: Increased the rating by 1 after some solitaire play. This is fun as a light simulation, but still not very interesting as a game.

This is the most playable "Serious" Napoleonic Era Game around.
Its elegant & avoids most of the diplomatic & bean counting
quagmeirs that similar games of this type can cause.

The game counters & systems really give the feel of warfare in this period.
The card system which I usually hate works well here.

Its not a 10 for me as I feel the area of Supply was not fully developed
its effects are simulated in Winter Attrition but that doesn't really
do it...however its easily fixed with a house rule.

A solid game based on historial accuracy.

The game is very chaotic, so long term strategies are impossible and the game is a series of not-very-relevant tactical decisions. I don't like the permanent elimination mechanism which can lead to gamey tactics (weaker forces are sometime better than stronger forces). The map is completely wrong (among others, it places the Kaliningrad enclave in Russia !). But the game is quick, fun and pretty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
If The War of the Ring plays like the Tolkien trilogy, then Age of Napoleon plays like David Chandler's masterpiece "The Campaigns of Napoleon." There is not a nuance of the Napoleonic wars that is missed save maybe an insurrection piece for The Vendee, although the card "Republicans and Royalists" covers this somewhat.

Manouevre, battle and political intrigue combine to make this a fascinating journey through the Napoleonic era from Ulm and Austerlitz to Waterloo via Jena-Auerstadt, Eylau, Friedland, Wagram, Leipzig and as many intermediate points as you have the appetite for.

The second version of the rules is a godsend and Renaud Verlaque seems always to be on hand in the BGG forums to answer any queries. The first version actually went through a living-rules phase on the BGG forums under the author's guidance before evolving into the current edition. This shows an outstanding committment on Mr Verlaque's part.

I do not intend to go into the mechanics in any detail save to say that this is a card driven game where the cards, as well as being used for the mundane tasks of moving, battling and political back-stabbing, tell a story and that story is Napoleon's journey through the years 1805 to 1815. But never fear, for those who need their regular rolling fix, the protagonists are provided with one die apiece; red for the Allies and blue for the French.

One of the strongest points is the beautifully produced components. The map is both excellent and functional, the artwork on the cards is outstanding and finally the pieces representing the corps and their leaders make you feel that you are actually ordering a Massena or a Davout on that all important campaign rather than just pushing cardboard.

I purchased some counter sleds (see the image above and others I have uploaded for this game) and painted them to give an extra visual and tactile dimension, not to mention a fog of war and would recommend this to anyone who has purchased this work.

If I have one gripe, it is that I would have to buy a brand new copy of the second edition to bring my original up to date and would wish that an upgrade pack consistiong of the rule books, cards and charts only were available. I am sure that some of the seven-hundred-odd owners here on BGG would appreciate that.

In summary I have to declare that I am a lover of Napoleonic history and an avid wargamer. This game fulfills both my needs admirably.

Verdict: A Masterpiece.

Overall, a fairly accurate depiction of the time period.  Some luck creeps in with the ability of the coalition player to find insurgency cards quickly enough, but it may be that good play alone is enough to cancel out or at least minimize this luck factor.  Of course, if the Coalition player is drawing poor cards AND the French player is rolling well the Coalition player stands little chance.

RATING: 7
Age of Napoleon is as rich a meal as you can get without stepping into hardcore wargame territory: within several hours two players will have "negotiated" (if you can call the diplomacy cards that), supplied, moved and fought armies during the ten years of the Napoleonic wars. 

The game is mainly card-driven, with several charts for the different phases of the game, and adds a very strong historic flavour, not necessarily for the accuracy or order of the facts (which I suppose are thoroughly researched), but for the consideration of many factors during the campaigns as well (at least for a non-wargamer). The lovely artwork makes the game even more endearing.

There is just one considerable problem: the rulebook is well structured, but otherwise confusing and at some points redundant. There is so much information crammed into those pages it's easy to suspect that it could be sorted more efficiently, but difficult to imagine how. The living rulebook helps a bit, but without any scenario to get you warm it will take LOTS of effort to start a game (already for reading the rulebook, in fact).

Only played the 1813 scenario so throw as much salt on this comment as you like. The cards, the movement, the stacks, the battles, withdraws / retreats / intercepts ... all straightforward and pleasant enough. But all the crappy little wibble rules about what can and what can't change political alignment, when and when not, with multiple exceptions not just here but in other areas of the rules, turns what (for me) could have been a pleasant rollercoaster of a wargame into a queue for a rollercoaster. The difference in power between cards seems big and the game seems swingy as a result, and it's possible for small stacks to beat bigger stacks, so there's more swingy. Which would be fine if the game were otherwise rules clean, but it's not, which lessens the allure of exploring the longer scenarios which aren't as slam-bam as the 1813 "the world is crumbling, hang on" scenario.

The Napoleonic Wars in four hours with an elegant two player system. The counters and map are minor works of art and the elegant system works well. The French will find it difficult to win, but have the advantage of breaking ties if the game ends in a draw. I have my house rules, you can only use a diplomatic card once against each major power each turn, and they can be used to affect two minor powers instead of just one. Also Russia needs to be conquered as a French Dominion for a French major victory, not just be a French Ally.

Played a few times and the system is still a bit opaque as far as visualizing what should be done and how to get there.  And for some reason, the rules still aren't sticking in my head.  Perhaps it's the large number of exceptions to remember.  Contrasted to this, Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is a breeze to learn and play.  I also think I like Hannibal's finer level of detail compared to AoN's rather chunky units/general combinations and movement-rating-based restrictions in interception/withdrawal/etc.

A good two player game that covers the period well and leaves one with a taste of it.  The card system makes you make decisions and do what you can with what you have.  You want to play with the second edition cards and rules.  Two games played came down to one die roll on each to see who could win the tie.  Beautiful components, my only wish would be for a better rulebook and that the cards would not be so powerful when it comes to removing countries, the diplomacy can be very harsh.

Very nice chit wargame.  Though it maintains the standard wargame fare of charts and tables, it is able to keep itself manageable and true to theme w/o bogging you down too much.

The diplomacy cards can be much too strong. A lot of work can be blown away with one card. Looks great and plays fine but the cards...just doesn't do it for me. AT least in a dice fest game there is some statistical balance; in AoN one single card can be devastating.

Note: this refers to the first edition rules only. I have yet to be able to play with the second edition rules that 'fixes' the diplomacy issue.

Great game so far...  doesn't play that fast from the 1805 scenario but it has a lot of depth in how to launch your attack as the French and how to contain them as the Collition.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For its scale I think this is a great simulation and a good game.  It is a fairly highly evolved descendant of We the People, and is quite dissimilar in detail.  The game plays fairly fast (4 hours), covers a lot of history, and is exciting.  My gripes are that it is a bit too chromey/complex, and the diplomacy system does not have the finesse of the rest of the game.  The core movement/ interception/ battle/ attrition system is very elegant, but there are a few too many little fiddly bits: 2 separate rules relating to movement to Sweden which is of miniscule significance in the game.  The diplomacy seems the main weak point: it is both too complex and yet not satisfying in play.  The diplomacy cards are certainly powerful (they swing a state out of the enemy camp, or a neutral into your camp) and some players feel that lucky draws can unbalance the game.  This may be so, but my feeling is just that they suck the fun out of the game.  You campaign for two years to conquer some country (which is good fun and involves extensive planning), only to see it snatched away by the play of a single Insurrection card (which does not require extensive planning).  A more reactive, but simplified, diplomacy system, perhaps having more pre-conditions or allowing counter-bids to the play of diplomacy and insurgency cards would greatly enhance this game for me.  As it stands, Hannibal remains my favourite in the family, because although some of its problems (like the Major Campaign cards) are fixed in Age of Napoleon, the subtle interplay of war and politics feels like it has been dumbed down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My rating of "7" is tentative, as I have only played this once. Napoleonics is not a primary interest for me, so this game had just the level of detail that was right for me. It might be too simplistic for serious students of the era. This was also my first exposure to a modern card-driven game... the technique makes for fascinating game play, but I'm not sure how suitable it is in terms of historical accuracy. The ability to "peer into the future" and know with certainty that something will occur (because I hold the card for it in my hand) just doesn't feel quite right. But one playing of one title is not enough to make any final judgments.

RATING: 8
Truly a magnificent game. You have to respect all the grand problems that each side faced during the Napoleonic era and how to situtions changed on a grand scale. We are talking about a game that represents all the tough strategic choices on a larger scale and all the diplomatic changes throughout the period on a playable format that takes about 2-4 hours. There isn't any other game that does everything so well under these constraints. The gameplay has kinda a light feel but the fluid gameplay is another thing that makes this game so great for me. The representation of The Napoenic era is so impressive that each time play Age of Napoleon I feel like that I'm recreating and reliving the history. The three different scenarios have their own unique features and special aspects that keep you attracted during the game. The French player usually has a slight edge but most of the games have been very tight and interesting games overall. Rulebook has some issues but once get past them, the game is a very enjoyable experience. 
Edit. The rulebook would need a major rewrite and I can't justify anything higher than a 9 as a rating.

For a game on the Napoleonic Wars to be playable in an (albeit long) evening is an accomplishment.

There is a huge X factor in this game.  For example, defeating Prussia or Austria is a good "bad thing" for the French with those defeated nation's pretty awesome "reformed military" units then becoming available.  That said, this game works for me and evokes an awesome yet terrible military age.

Neat strategy/war game. It's card-driven and therefore not historically correct (very random). For example in one session the player of France conquered all of continental Europe (incl. Moscow), while in another the Russians took Paris at around 1809. It's fun though.

Very tight game that captures the feeling of the Napoleonic Wars well.  Lot's of crazy SNAFUs can pop up that one has to deal with, but they are all entertaining.  Sure the cards can make the diplomacy a little swingy, but the allegiances could have shifted out totally different, so it doesn't feel historically inaccurate to me.  

There are lots of fun ways to play the game out.  It is far from feeling like it is on rails, which could be a danger in this kind of strategic level game.

My only (small) complaint is that I wish that there were symbols on the cards that let you know that they are French or Coalition only cards.

I don't believe it is fair for me to rate this yet - it really looks like there is a good game there, but for some reason my main opponent and I have had a very difficult time understanding the rules (that we do not have with other very complex games).

Purchased 3/22/07. Game is a real looker. Components are great except the cards are on the thin side for my taste, given that they will be used heavily in the game.

Game appears to be well worth the price I paid at ThoughtHammer.

Components: 9.5 Great looking game; only ding it for the thin cards.
Rules: 8 Have 2nd version; could be a bit better organized for my tastes, some fuzzy areas.
Game play: 9 I think it achieves just what the designer said he aimed for, and it plays very well.

I'm still on the fence about this, so my rating may go up after a few more plays.  But my goodness, those diplomacy and insurrection cards do drastically alter your chances in this game.  Perhaps I need to learn the strategies to make the best out of bad situations.  We'll see.  It does look fantastic, and I find Napoleonic games such a blast.

A game I wouldn't have thought could be made--fun, quick simulation of the Napoleonic period.  The force pool and combat mechanics elegantly re-create the basic realities of Napoleonic warfare.  My only problem with the game is that diplomatic events overshadow a lot of what happens on the board.

EDIT:  Downgraded due to the diplomacy system--just an unacceptable number of games with very little action on the board.

RATING: 3
Late rating, but AoN ultimately falls squarely into the "Game I really wanted to like, but didn't." category. 

Great components, but quirky and cramped. Poor rules. The design seemed to have lost its focus somewhere along the way. 

Some of the cards are not well thought out at all, and the imbalance between the effectiveness of military versus diplomatic action is a sore spot. 

From a first time designer, and it shows.

It's pretty good; 8-10 plays. It's a very pretty game, and it's up there with Hammer of the Scots as one of my preferred two-player lightish wargames. There are a LOT more rules to remember, though, and that makes it hard to just take out again. It's a little like War of the Ring in that respect, only shorter, cleaner and better.

It doesn't matter how many times you read them, the rules for this game are incomprehensible. It feels like the rulebook has been written to remind you of how the game works instead of teaching it in the first place. You can probably complete a campaign of [i]Vietnam 1965-1975[/i] in the time it would take to get these rules down properly.

RATING: 7
Dynamics, Strategy, Poker-faced-plotting & Backstabbing diplomacy. Well balanced for being card-driven; with optional rules to balance it even more. The only downside is a somewhat tricky rulebook that takes several readings to fully grasp.
Kudos to the game's designer, Mr. Renaud Verlaque, for spending so much time here at boardgamegeek; answering questions and listening to what people have to say. His updated rulebook (available for download on this site) is a must.

A game for intermediate and experienced players

edit: lowered the grade after playing may more games in the genre and growing slightly bored with CDGs

RATING: 6
Chalk your first two games up to learning efforts, and by the third time you will very much enjoy this one.  Its an easy system to know, and the rulebook very manageable.  Few errata so far, but compared to other wargames in the genre, you will find this errata very small.

Components are top quality and pleasing.  About the only thing that would have been better would be to have the individual generals' pictures on the counters.

Would have liked a deck of say 100 cards instead of 55, and I'm sure there are many other Napoleonic 'events' that could have been covered with some extra cards, but perhaps this is where an expansion kit could come in...

Gave it a 9 instead of 10 only because of the last point.  A few more cards would have increased the unpredictibilty factor from game to game which would therefore have increased replayability.

I have downgraded recently to an 8.  This because of a couple of games that ended ultra-fast due to the luck factor.  It just sucks for one player to get all the diplomacy cards and the Napoleonica cards.  Auto-victory in that case.

Had to downgrade once again to a 7.  After many plays, I still feel the game is much too driven by the luck of the cards.

Dropped another point to 6.  There are just too many other better games out there, but I may revisit this rating after comparing with other strategic Napoleonics.

The components and the illustrations are a work of art, except the box, it is a generic design and is not adjusted to the perfection.  

It is my first wargame in my collection, although I hate Napoleon, does not remove that this wargame be a good game.  

It inserts to the perfection with the history and the diplomatic phase is very curious, besides the use of the units, short time, driven card, the luck is very controlled...

It is a relatively simple play, and the manual explains it "almost all", one must continue the alive rules that publishes the author to purify the errors found in the original rules. It is an excellent wargame.

#----0----# 

Los componentes y las ilustraciones son una obra de arte, excepto que la caja al tratarse de un diseño generico, no se ajusta a la perfección.

Es el primer wargame, en toda regla con tengo en mi colección, aunque el tema Napoleonico lo odio, no quita que este juego sea un buen juego. 

Encaja a la perfección con la historia y la fase diplomática es muy curiosa, además del uso de las unidades. La suerte está muy controlada y los dados no juegan una mala pasada, es controlable...

Es un juego relativamente sencillo, y el manual lo explica "casi todo", hay que seguir la reglas vivas que publica el autor para depurar los errores encontrados en el reglamento original. Por lo demás ninguna pega, dura poco, los niños se hacen rapidamente con el reglamento... en resumen es un excelente juego.

Interesting ideas but there are several problems with the game.

1) The rules are not intuitive but that's also because some of the concepts or the application of those are rather unique

2) The game seems to reward a defense play for Napoleon, which doesn't adequately simulate his aggressive style. The best play seems to not make surrender the major countries as they can then reform or implement the continental system.

3) the movement system is disturbing with the automatic withdrawal or interception if the movement rating is equal or greater (which favors the defender again)

4) Some events will be rarely seen, for example the Continental system will rarely be applied as it can only be played if Britain is the only major Coalition player

5) insurrections are too powerful. When you have one, it's quasi impossible to reconquer the country

6) with all this, the game depends a lot of the luck of the cards (especially the insurrection card) and rewards defense instead of attack for the French player.

To be played again to see if these blemishes are as bad as it seems at first sight

Age of Napoleon is remarkable good game. Visually appealing and very interesting execution of grand strategy game. In fact, relative simplicity of the game has invited attention of non-wargamers and this is a feat.

Probably not the Best Wargame Ever, but it keeps attracting me and I'm happy that after a long time of gathering dust, AoN got on the table again. It took some time to go through the rules, but after playing the 1813-scenario (partly) I'm confident that the full campaign will be fought before the end of this year (2010).
On a sidenote: the board and counters are simply beautiful!

This is a simple, card-driven wargame I can get behind.  The simplicity and fast-pace of it makes it much more appealing than games like [gameid=91], which can become long, drawn-out affairs.  This plays fast, and the rules are very easy to internalize.  Takes very little time for rules explanation, even less than games like [gameid=234].  The game has a very elegant flow to it, as Napoleon will run around crushing armies for the first part of the game, but will find that the subtle pressures of diplomacy and insurrection will have him backpedaling by the end if he doesn't gain enough ground.  And woe to any fool who invades Russia without securing his supply train.

2nd Edition rules:

  The game is very quirky, and takes a few plays to get the hang of it down, but it is a really fun way to spend some time. Looks great, the different take on the CDG system is interesting, and with the less swingy nature of the diplomacy cards in the 2nd edition, a really great way to abstract the weird diplomatic nature of the time. France can pretty much steamroll Austria and Prussia, but has a hard time making it to Moscow, and Insurrections can quickly bring them down.

This game helped me to make sense out of the Napoleonic Wars. I don't think the outcome rests largely on the skill of the players, but I don't really mind because watching the game-world operate is interesting in its own right.

Two small criticisms:
1. I think the minor victory conditions should be ignored as they encourage a passive, defensive French strategy that can make the game stagnate. I also doubt either side would have settled for such an ambiguous resolution to the conflict anyway.
2. The rules, while improved in the 2nd edition, are still a bit vague in places.

Fantastic map, best map in collection, Good strategic card driven game. Both sides are balanced well. Rules are very hard ,with lots of little exceptions and details to remember. Reading the rulebook is a chore. I like the wargame part of the game with dice modifying tables. The cards are a bit too powerful, especially the diplomacy cards shake the game a little bit too much.

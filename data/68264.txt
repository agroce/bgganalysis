The full campaign is long (Difficult to make it under 10 h) and I'd probably think of introducing a few minor changes in future games but overall plays great and feels like a classic; think that victory conditions are worth noticing as they keep things tense and exciting.

This is a solid game that was ruined (to me) by its over-zealous fans.

You get on the wargame forum and see people saying, "I never played a wargame.  Can you recommend one?" And then while some of us are saying Memoir 44 and such, a few NR fanboys start recommending this.

Now keep in mind I'm not a new wargamer, but I was under the impression that it was Memoir-easy.  So I skimmed the rules (the 24 page rulebook is your first sign that it's not an introductory wargame), and said, "I'll figure it out as I go."

Bad idea.  It's not that game.  I could not get on top of the exceptions: do counterblows, counterattacks and such get you that terrain bonus or not?  Can my armor advance multiple hexes after combat or does the mud stop me?  Are my Soviet units 2-step units or just really powerful 1-step units and what exactly is this fortress thing?  Stuff like that.  That is not introductory wargame material.

I was unsure of what I could and could not do, let alone figure out a coherent strategy.  I grew so frustrated at how I was struggling to figure out this "introductory" wargame (especially after having just figured out [thing=11825][/thing] and thinking I was on top of the world), that the "fun factor" was killed and I traded my copy out of frustration.

Had GMT used Avalon Hill's idea (or even VPG's idea) and broke the rules into introductory, intermediate, and advanced, then yeah, this game could have possibly been that introductory game.

Now with that said, there are a lot of cool things in this game: the cards, the counterblows, two CRTs... a lot of interesting ideas.  That's why I gave it a 5: I had some moments of genuine fun combine with lots of "Arrrrgggghhhh!" moments, and those were only because I did not study the game more carefully before I played, because I didn't think I needed to.

The game is absolutely gorgeous to look at, and it won a ton of awards, so if you are interested, by all means, take a look, but if you are new to wargames, don't start here, and all you fans of this game, THIS IS NOT M44 EASY!!!  QUIT BILLING IT AS SUCH!!!  Don't sour new recruits to our genre with your enthusiasm.  If you are new to wargaming and already bought this, find an experienced player and have them teach you.  Once you got a grip, then go back and read the rulebook.  I think you will like this a lot -- just learn from my lesson.

Played Solo but I can easily estimate how great this game is for 2 players. I mean really great. It has so many details in events, units, history and other aspects of the campaign to be deep enough but in a very simplified way. The solo version (the reason i bought this game) is well structured and very deep even if we are not talking about a real AI as real solo games, I had the feeling to watch the game unfold rather than to really compete against someone or a system.
So in the end I did not feel the result really "mine" or strictly related to my overall performance.

RATING: 8
Provisional rating after one play of the first scenario. Really like the basic mechanics. The rule book that shipped with the game is worthless and some of the cards are worded kind of strangely. I definitely think this needed another revision before it went to print. 

However, the living rules cleared up a lot of confusion and now that I've played I find that I do like the mechanics as much as I thought I would. There's a lot to think about and important decisions to make every turn. Counterblows and cardplay are fun. 

The game is a little fiddly in regards to "do x on turn y or z is in effect on turns a-c" but I guess that's a common wargame thing that I can learn to live with. I think some of it may be able to be expressed more clearly as well. 

The opening turn is really scripted but it opens up after that. The cards help enormously with this.

update: Lowered to 7. I haven't played another game yet, but the endless rules questions in the forum (and not "I'm too lazy to read the rules" questions like a lot of games) and the lack of distinct timing rules for the playing of cards both really rub me the wrong way. It diminishes my enthusiasm for further plays.

update: playing the campaign game in several sessions via vassal and I'm really enjoying it. Everything is much more clear with the errata and FAQ. Back up to 8.

After finishing the campaign the rating of 8 stands. It's quite an exceptional game but I have some criticisms. The 1945 content is pretty awful and neither my opponent nor I had any fun with it. I have some issues with some of the card effects (notably the lack of drawing a card to replace the one you lose to the reshuffle cards) but generally everything hangs together quite well. I'm skeptical of the short scenarios since it seems like a few good dice rolls could decide the game. I'm happy I played the campaign and I'd be happy to play it again.

Fabulous! Among the best games I ever played. Well designed, and quite easy despite the many factors to keep in mind during the game. I love how the game properly balances unpredictability with actual strategy. I love the line of support mechanism and how the EZOC are managed. The rail movement is awesome. The game follows step by step the whole russian campaign and its aftermath. Simply Awesome!The GMT version of the game is so elegant and fabulous that it is truly a crime not to own a copy.

The Russian Campaign at a strategic scale with a low counter density.  No Retreat is an interesting hybrid of old school hex and counter with card driven mechanisms.  Those cards can be used for their events, to force enemy attacks, or for replacing or upgrading your units.  Here lie some of the most challenging decisions in the game.  No Retreat models key elements of the war pretty well; the Russian winter, the gradual improvement of the Soviet forces and the negative effects to the German side of Hitler's meddling.  The result is an enjoyable game that gives both players plenty to think about.

Production quality is to GMT's best standard; a mounted map, nice big counters and charts and tables crammed with (too much?) information.  The artwork is simple but functional.  I found the rules tough to digest.  After a first read through I was left with only a sketchy idea of how they all fitted together.  The second edition rules contain far more errata than should be the case with a re-published game.  Downloading one of several excellent player aids that walk you through a turn step by step is recommended.

One of the best games I have ever played, not just wargames. This game is so much fun, and models so much history with a minimum of counters. The card play also really keeps things interesting. Since it is a wargame, it is borderline impossible to get to the table, which is a real tragedy. I would gladly play this any time.

Nice components. Rules could have been better tweaked before publishing. I am bothered that 2nd edition seems to alter balance while still leaving some unclarity (pe that a friendly city in a non-negated EZOC is not a supply source is nowhere clearly stated in the rules).

I've now played several scenarios (of Barbarossa and Fall Blau) and a full campaign game (and a 2nd campaign game that auto-victoried early). I'm impressed. For the shorter scenarios there's the chance that weather (or a few lucky draws/rolls) will decide the game, but it plays fast.

Short enough so that a scenario is 2-3 hours (tops, sometimes shorter) and the campaign can be done in a day (8-10 hours if it goes the distance).

Great components, just a few units, so every decision counts!

One of my favorite wargames. 

The basic rules aren't complicated, but there's quite a few subtle distinctions and rough edges. I added a FAQ to the wiki, and I suggest going to the file section and printing off a player aid (or two different ones) for quick reference.

Un tour de force notable d'avoir pu condenser tout le front Est dans un aussi petit format. Chapeau!

Beaucoup de mécanismes originaux plaqués sur un igo-ugo hex-and-counters classique. Peut-être un peu trop.

Mes deux réserves concernent d'abord le niveau de chrome, pas toujours nécessaire mais assez dense avec tout plein de règles spéciales et d'exceptions qui donnent certes de la saveur mais qui font que le jeu perd en simplicité. De plus, l'édition des règles est franchement mauvaise avec des termes vagues, imprécis, des références croisées inutiles... avec les changements de la v2 c'est pire car des éléments importants ne se retrouvent pas sur les tables de la carte.

Ensuite, je ne suis pas sûr que le jeu marche bien au-delà de 1942 et je suis certain qu'il ne marche pas du tout en 1945.

Le jeu me semble biaisé en faveur de l'Axe qui peuvent très bien gagner au GT6 (un vrai sudden death) et qui, s'ils ne font pas trop d'erreurs ensuite, pourront selon toutes probabilités survivre jusqu'à la fin.

C'est d'ailleurs pour cela j'imagine que Carl a fait des changements importants dans les règles d'hiver 41 et permis l'empilement des armées blindées soviétiques à partir du GT11.

Enfin, le jeu qui va au-delà de 1942 dure une grosse journée.

Donc un design solide, inventif mais exigeant pour les joueurs et possiblement déséquilibré. 

RÉVISION:je baisse la cote à 3.9. Beaucoup trop frustrant, les détails, les mécanismes ampoulés, l'impact profond de la combinaison de certaines cartes et l'importance démesurée de certains roulés de dés... À partir de la fin 42, on est plus en terrain historique, c'est n'importe quoi.

Played the opening turns of this a few times with my face to face gaming buddy. Looks to be a tight, fast-playing take on the Eastern Front. Rating tentative - but man, the Soviets have a rough time in this game! We couldn't get deep into the game because the Russians seemed to get surrounded and pummeled so easily. This is undoubtedly the design's intention of simulation. Certainly there is deep strategy - we just haven't explored it enough yet.

RATING: 10
Every once in a while, a game is published that deserves instant classic status.  By blending classic wargame concepts such as hexes, CRTs, ZOCs and adding in some new ideas such as card informed play (not card driven play), a novel use of blitz combat and counterattack,  and a minimalist use of counters, No Retreat is the best wargame design in years.  Finely balanced with gripping decision making, No Retreat is no counter stack slugfest.  Instead, it brings an epic campaign to life with smart design and precise strategic play.

Edit:  I cannot believe that I will be writing this next sentence, but it is entirely true.  No Retreat has become my favorite east front game, replacing my decades long favorite, The Russian Campaign.  A genuinely great game here.

Got this as a 21st century Lite EF strategic game, and it largely fits the bill.  Many excellent facets, and a special bravo for the mostly successful dovetailing of nice operational/quasi-tactical chrome on the cards into the grand strategic scale picture. 

Many people have waxed at length on the deserved kudos for this solid game, and rightly so.  But after four solo plays, the things that prevent me from gushing gaga over it as well are:

1.  Length -- it's still a 10 hour game; maybe FTF pros can zip through it faster, but the best clip I've managed is about 3 full turns an hour.  Still excellent for an east front game, but this is definitely a Light-Moderate game vice lite; chrome and card ambiguities are the main contributors.

2.  Late Game Play -- it may just be me so far; I am generally mediocre/sucky at pulling off blitzkrieg offensives.  But it seems that 

a) the Soviets just don't have enough units on map, or get stacking capability early enough, or get enough Shock markers, or whatever, to become the real Steam Roller in 1944-45  

b.  Exchange results become increasingly painful, especially to the Shock armies as the Sov try to advance west. And boy, do I crap out a lot of EX results on Soviet offensives!  Then bye bye to the shock armies, and it's back to no effect and counterblow city, and another turn lost with no Ger armies killed, or cities taken.  The average EX against a competent Ger defense causes the Ger a 1 sp drop in strength annoyance, while it annihilates a mighty 8 sp shock army, or Guards Tank army, at least for 3/4 of the turns.  Really?  That 3 sp weakest Ger inf army just taking out the Guards Tanks?  Really?  Okayyyyyyyyy.....Frustrating with a capital F.

c.  Germans retain 4 card draws, which become increasingly important for them to rebuild at least 1 step a turn (regarding said Frustrating EX results) through the whole game, at least until the oil fields are taken.  I have to question if this card quantity, and hence, Repl potential really fits, especially from the D-Day turn onward.  

The late game skew is further amplified and highly exacerbated on the 1945 switch; 

d)  the deck gets loaded with "Ivan didn't take Finland?  Bucharest?  The Oil fields?"  screwya cards, which can drain VPs faster than a bottomless bucket for Ivan.  Is there any errata saying you can only be screwed for failing to take the very hard to kill Finnish army once?  Or can I lose 5 VP if I pull the card five times?  Can't find anything in the rules that says I don't get bit each time...Just sayin'.

and 

e) the Germans get a half dozen fortress and VS units that, in conjunction with the Soviets' under-gunned offensive capability, have ensured that my Ivans have never reached Berlin in a game, much less taken it.  The Ger SS panzergrenadier unit is also aces, and has contributed more than once to some epic "Festung Warsawa" three turn sieges in late game.  

f)  The immortal Hungarians; did I miss something?  In the game, I can geographically overrun all of Hungary, and 90% of Germany, holding that ground for several turns.  But those two feisty 2-3 blue guys can keep regenerating Hungarian warriors out of the ether, and those dreaded "return to play in 2 turns" flipsides will be staring at me on the turn track once more.  Admirable loyalty to Adolph (or even his infernal ghost, once his counter's off the board), astounding and maddening for Joe S.

So, this may all just be my incompetent play, and/or my solo omniscience -- but I doubt it; I'm not that lame a player all the time.  The 44-45 Soviets just do not have enough oomph, and the 44-45 Germans still seem too resilient, and too propped up, to enable the historical probabilities consistently.

May work way better in a two player FTF, where skill, luck, and guile may be uneven and dynamic.  My assessment may change with more experience at game tricks as well; but it won't change the pile of Ger forts or Screwya cards in the deck, which I think will temper my enjoyment of an otherwise outstandingly proportioned and colorful game.

After a handful of plays this game has turned into my all time favourite WW2 game!

Magnificent! The components are lovely (thick, sturdy counters, mounted map board, a lot of information recorded on the map itself and the player aids etc.) and what really makes this game shine compared to similar ones is the speed of gameplay (including set up), the historical accurracy despite and/or thanks to the scale of the map and the time covered in one turn and the limited amount of counters needed to play the game, which partially explains the fast-pace of the game!

Just superb! Can't wait for GMT's version of NR2 (African desert)

This game successfully packs the punch detail of many larger and more complex East Front games into one manageable package. There are chances for a wide variety of plausible events and outcomes thanks to the remarkable combat system (which allows for counterattacks and advances during the opposing player's turn) and event deck (which allows players the opportunity to return units into play, capitalize on unusual events and situations, and mobilize units by rail).

I'm looking forward to the North African game that uses this system, as well the updated version of the game.

One of the most enjoyable East Front gaming sessions in my experience. Not that I have had a lot mind you.

Easy to play due in large part to low counter density, yet with plenty of chrome to satisfy the lay historian in me. It captured the first eastbound, then westbound attraction of the campaign nicely.

Played out the whole 1941-45 shebang in an afternoon as a newbie and had a great time doing it. Kind of what the hobby is about no?

Just got the new edition in - looks great. Love the new mounted map. Too bad there is already non-trivial errata, but it doesn't look problematic.

For fans of No Retreat! from VPG, there have been changes. Not a ton, but some optional rules have been made standard, some new optional rules have been added, and there have been tweaks significant enough that you'll need to review how to play the game. All of them look like improvements, but I still need to play the new version.

Far from the 'simple' game I'd been expecting. The rules cover 24 pages. The GMT version is the usual deluxe quality of games such as Twilight Struggle and Washington's War. The cards are interesting, easy to use and add to the gameplay and replayability. Including the extra armour counters was nice for those of us who like to see where our tanks are but I'd still rather they'd done away with NATO symbols entirely and used helmets or soldiers for regular infantry and halftracks or trucks for mechanised infantry. Overall, the game is a little on the abstract side (with the zones of control and lines of supply) but I really disliked the counterblow rule which can force well entrenched units to throw away all their advantages to make pointless suicidal attacks.

An enjoyable but uninspiring first play of the Barbarrosa scenario has made me reconsider whether I really am a burgeoning wargamer. While I really appreciate how the history is imbedded in the reinforcements, weather, and other turn-based rules and how salients are created by pushing counters around rather than through eliminations (mostly), I'm still not a fan of the vagaries of a pretty coarse CRT. Admittedly, I didn't even come close to understanding how to use the movement and attack, counterattack, and counterblow mechanisms to true effect, so I shouldn't be quick to judge. Also, there is still something wildly romantic about playing the campaign game.

More game than simulation. Too much "design for effect" elements, too much "gameyness". It give no feel of East Front struggle. Some kind of toy for beginners.

It's good, and playing the whole campaign in one evening is a massive plus. Much is abstracted but at this scale, that's a given. Simple mechanics for the core of the game, but the whole game isn't as simple it seems to claim. There are a lot of add-on rules to the core rules which are essential for the game. Remembering everything is a pain despite the admirable efforts made to aid memory. But ultimately, a lot of fun.

Rating based on a single playing of the 5 turn scenario against a friend.  The game was literally decided on the last of four attacks made by the Soviet player on the last turn for a 1 point Soviet win.

I can see right off this is will have a lot of replay value.  However, I'm still on the fence regarding the Mandated Attacks - I can see how and why they are there, but the Soviet player is so thin on the ground to begin with that I get the feeling this is to much of a good thing.

[u]Innovator[/u] hex and counter Eastern Front WWII strategic wargame. It has cards but it's not a card-driven game. Great depth and playability with a few number of counters. I like the tactical chess-like movements combined with overall strategical planning. Outstanding supply rules and it's nice how the time (and weather effects) affects the two forces, with Germans stronger in the first half and Russians stronger in the second half. Several scenarios to choose from, including the two mini-scenarios from BGG for quick sessions.
Unfortunately the rules are not very well written and they are a lot of rules and little things to remember (for a casual player), so it's easy to play it wrong. The [i]Bridger[/i]'s video tutorial (along with the Turn Summary 1.2) helps a lot to learn this system.
High quality of components. Includes the counters and print-and-play rules for playing "No Retreat! [color=red]Solitaire[/color]" Expansion Kit. But the best solitaire mode is to play both sides.

J'ai fait de nombreuses parties avec la version VPG, et j'ai vite craqué pour cette version GMT.
Le matériel est somptueux et ajoute un vrai plus au jeu. Le problème vient que le nouveau livret de règles, tout en couleur, est truffé d'imprécisions. Il faut le réimprimer à nouveau pour jouer avec tous les compléments!
C'est quand même exagéré pour un produit qui n'est pas donné... Finalement la première version est plus stable et j'ai revendu celui-ci...
Ah, au fait, pour la campagne complète, quelle que soit la version, nous n'avons jamais vu les Soviétiques l'emporter!

An amazingly simple wargame after just 1 trial-run. I admit that at first the terms elimiinated, destroyed, shattered, and surrendered are a bit confusing but now I can appreciate the mechanics of play behind it.

I can't wait to try the solitaire variant.

I worried that the few counters=shallow game.  Not so, fun, lots of mechanisms that give the game depth such as counterblows, cardplay, very fluid advance after combat, etc.  I never really got into Russian Campaign with some of it's gamey rules, but I really enjoy this title.  The Solo module works very well also setting goals and adding unexpected events.  I've always had a hard time though figuring out the vp track.

One of the best strategic level ETO war games made. Low counter density ensure that a scenario can be played in one evening. The CA/CB mechanic is unique and fun. Card play adds variability as well. The campaign game is amazing as well. Heavy Cardboard needs to review this.

Exactly what I was looking for.  A campaign level hex and counter game with CRT and not too many rules.  The concept of "counterblow" takes a long time to figure out.  I would explore other games in the series if they were as elegant. The Barbarossa set up is a wonderful illustration of how the Germans reach Moscow right when the weather is hardest and their supply chain is pushed to the brink.

There is much to like in this game, but I have my concerns about the 'streakiness' of the cards and the d6 CRT, given the size of the units (Fronts/Armies) and the turn frame of 1turn/2months.

An interesting strategic Eastern Front game at an extremely high level.  The scale results in Front/Army-level battles with low counter densities.  Movement is simple and there is an aggressive ZOC rule to stop units from advancing too far.  The combat uses a CRT.  I like the concepts of counterblows and counterattacks; these add a new element to this style of game.  The cards, although sometimes difficult to interpret, add a nice action/reinforcement mechanic.  Aside from the rules being slushy and vague at times, this is a fun game.

The quality of the components are awesome! I've played a lot of game using the VPG version and enjoyed it, but the deluxe version has such a great feel to it. The size of the board, the size of the hexes, the quality of the artwork, and of course the amazing game play. NR Deluxe has become one of my all-time favorites!

RATING: 8
Russians need to play to history and strategically retreat until reserves come up - Germans HAVE to play aggressive. We didn't do that and the Germans turned on their heels and were running much sooner than historically.  Looks like there is a decent amount of replay-ability here too - need to play again.

RATING: 6
Rating after some solitaire play. After several failed attempts, I finally managed to work up the effort to get through the rulebook and played it a bit.

Overall, I think it's a good, relatively simple game. That's not to say that it's simple to learn, only that it's simple to play. The 20+ page rulebook (with significant errata - be sure to get the living rules) with cards, supply, ezocs, weather, armor and advance after combat (both affected by weather), counterattacks and counterblows all combine to make the game more complex than it ought to be. The overall complexity is not terrible for a seasoned wargamer, but I think it's almost up there with your average Simonitch game in terms of rules complexity. It's the low counter density that keeps it from getting out of hand, though. People tend to recommend this game to newbies, which may not be wise, and have come under criticism for doing so. In any case, the upshot is a game that's probably much easier to learn from a teacher than from the rulebook.

The multi-use cards are a nice addition to otherwise fairly standard hex & counter stuff, and keep the game from being a dry 70's retread. Here they're used to give yourself local advantages, or for replacements. Heavy churn should ensure varied game play. Interestingly the weather is sometimes controlled by cards instead of simply a die roll, which means it can change mid-turn. The counterblow and counterattack results are a new twist.

So, overall, it's a fine game if you're looking an interesting and quick East Front system that you can play in a sitting or two. If you're looking for a simpler set of rules that may give you a similar experience using blocks, you should probably go with [i]Holdfast: Russia[/i] instead. If you're looking for something with more depth that's more granular, then you should pass.

At the end of the day it's a perfectly fine game, but at this point in my gaming career I think I'm just looking for a little more depth.

RATING: 6
Component wise a very nice package and the solitaire option makes it quite attractive.

Based on 3 scenario plays - there is a lot I like here, including the card play as resources and for events, the movt and combat systems are pretty good and well integrated and the number of historic/chrome factors it manages to roll into the main rule set - however both of the latter have problems as well.

The combat system relies on a single d6 and this can lead to very different outcomes from the same battle - the difference between rolling a 1 or a 2 can be vast and it only needs a couple of such results to go against you to effectively cost a player the game regardless of their play. Of course this is always a problem with games that use dice but single die games are more vulnerable to it and the CRT has vastly different outcomes on the same column. The argument against this criticism of dice is always that when you throw enough dice it should even out over the course of the game - but it's amazing how often this is not the case and in any case some die rolls are more critical than others. IN NR's case, the fact that there are a limited number of combats a turn, means it is even more vulnerable to this.

Although some of the history is seamlessly rolled into the main rule set there are quite a lot of 'exceptions' to rules to also cater for it. On the first several plays this means there is still quite a bit if rule searching and getting rules wrong.

RATING: 9.2
Loved it. Really loved it. And I haven't said that in a good while.

Not the most realistic version of the Eastern Front I've seen, but then if I wanted that I'd get heavily, heavily involved in ASL (I have a job, and a partner, and a life though). The components are damn good quality (except the cards maybe? sad face), everything is nicely clear and obvious what it means, the board is well-designed with clear and unambiguous colours - and to me, as a sufferer of Daltonism, that's a minor godsend. Everything gallops along at a reasonable clip and downtime is at a minimum.

The only grumble I'd have is an aesthetic one - I wish there was somewhere on the board that the weather could be recorded, quite obviously and clearly, each turn as no end of times my opponent and I simply forgot about the weather until after the combats had been resolved. A nice, decent sized square with a nice big MUD or SNOW or CLEAR marker would do wonders in the games that I've played.

The mechanics of blow-counterblow are fairly arcane and do take some getting used to, but improve the whole feel of the thing immensely. Easily the best wargame in my collection of the past 16 months.

Thanks Carl! Hope NR: African Front is as good.

RATING: 6
Players are either the Soviets or the Germans, fighting on the Eastern Front from 1941 to 1945.  Low density, large scale strategic Eastern Front game, with a lot of familiar stuff, and several totally alien concepts.  A fairly straightforward sequence of play sees card draws, supply checks, replacements, movement, combat, cleanup, and de-training.  It all looks deceptively simple, small rulebook, not many counters, but there is a ton of subtle stuff and exceptions that you literally have to pick out of the rulebook.  The replacement rules need to be read very carefully, as it depends on phase of the war and the types of units, that determines what you can actually replace.  Combat is mind blowing, as the defender can mandate attacks during the attacker's turn, a concept called Counterblow.  You can also roll up a Counterblow or Counterattack during combat resolution, and this along with multi-hex attacks means you have to look very carefully through the rules to make sure you're resolving it all correctly.  To top it off, there are about five ways to win the game, along with 2 or 3 pages on how to process different time track events and units.  A mixed bag, it lures you in and plays very well, but you do have to work at it to get it all straight.  Almost needs an introductory rules set ignoring Counterblow/attack results just to get you up and running.  

Certainly an interesting design, and it looks a treat, but ultimately games should be fun.  This one is an ongoing fight with an exception riddled rulebook.  

For those looking for a lighter take on the Eastern Front, that works, check out [b][thing=155496]Hold Fast: Russia 1941-1942[/thing][/b].

RATING: 6
I've only played half a game of this so far, so I can't really comment too much on it. It's also pretty much the only other hex game I've played other than Memoir '44. So, as my one of my first dives into the wargaming world, I think I liked it. I was the Germans, and made a strong drive initially (surprise suprise, right?), but was eventually stalled out by good tactics by my opponent, and never rolling higher than a 3. We quit half-way through; the hour had grown late and he had just pulled off a crushing blow against my northern line, so I figured I'd call it and come at future games better prepared.

My opponent was gracious, as he essentially had to muddle through the game himself and give me some Wargaming 101 on EZOCs, supply routes, and whatever the hell "chrome" is, and I think I'd try No Retreat! again. The card events were a bit swingy, but kept me on my toes, and the (I'm going on hearsay here) relatively simple supply rules and such made it a decent initial foray in to wargaming.

PS: False advertising warning. Contrary to the title, there is plenty of retreating. I felt this was particularly disingenuous of the designer, but will allow it to slide.

RATING: 8
Quite interesting wargame which packs a lot of small innovations in a short rulebook. I like a lot of the new mechanics that are introduced, but the rulebook can be quite daunting at first, with maybe too much information packed in. After the first few turns, the game tends to gel and understanding dawns.
Need to re-read the rulebook, but definitively worth playing more than once.
A keeper.

Great game about the Russian front with not that much units. It lets you play the all campaign in a few hours. One of the best games I played. 

Some people will call this an easy game and recommend this to new players. I don't agree with this at all. There are a lot of rules and little things to remember. Although I already had some experience when playing wargames. The first game of No retreat was a real mess with more time spend in the rulebook than playing the actual game.

I own VPG version but have mostly played GMT version. Both versions are great, GMT's more options and VPG's compactness are both great.

I like the campaign game although it is quite long and that is why I rate this only 8. The campaign plays like a good book and has a great feel and is fun to play. Flow of the WWII eastern front is perfectly captered. Cards make the game maybe a bit too chaotic, but at the same time they force the player to take a higher perspective that suits the game. You should approach your turn so that at least one of your attacks will be foiled by opponents cards.

Scenarios are good for learning purposes, but that is the end of their usability. Campaign game is where this one shines.

This is not a big-map, multi-unit Eastern Front game, like EastFront, that we all come to know and love but it does a good job in capturing the flavour of an Eastern Front campaign in a small game. It's tense, has lots of decision possibilities to mull over and adds a reasonable dash of uncertainty with the cards and dice.

If I have one complaint, it's the rules. They are relatively easy to understand but really require a play-through to 'get'. I think this may have to do with the non-intuitive way some concepts are explained in the rulebook, like victory point calculation.

I thought I was going to love this game, but after two plays, I’m not hooked enough to revisit it, and since the rules overhead is so high, I don’t see myself putting the effort back in to retry it. Hey, I’m all for some rules in my games, but this has to be the most exception laden game I’ve played in a long time. It’s a dense 24 page book complicated by the new rules come into play almost every turn. That’s OK in general, with repeated play, I could iron that in, but it does mean it has to be regularly played to keep those rules fresh, but the cards ultimately undo the game for me.

First, I’ll say that I do like the counterblow aspect. I found it quite novel and a refreshing take on tactical deployment. I like anything that makes tactical positioning more fun. And the supply puzzle is deep and worth exploring. 

But the cards betray both of those elements in that while you’re forced to spend time considering  your unit attacks as well as supply positions, your opponent can suddenly play a card to make all those considerations for naught. I watched my opponent spend several minutes configuring an attack just so I could play a card to make the attack not happen. He watched me position my units very carefully only to then play a card to give him extra movement to negate what I’d just done. I don’t mind cards that do that in theory, but not as part of a game where players are spending considerable time making decisions that are undone by instant surprise; those elements feel unsatisfying and out of balance.

Great low-complex hex-and-counter wargame with top notch components! The game looks good and captures the feeling of eastern front in the WW2. I hate wargames with huge stacks of counters, so this one is for me. As a CDG-fan I also like the cards in this game. I'm not good at playing 'No Retreat!', but ready to have a game anytime!

Haven't played this much yet but, it was one of the more accessible hex and counter games I have ever played. I took me a single read through of the rules to have a good understanding of how things would work. 

I was able to play through the first scenario with a friend who also read the rules and who hasn't even played any wargames before. We missed a few nuances but the next play will have far less mistakes.  

Really can't wait to play again!

Wonderful first experience.  I may review my rating after more plays, but right now, it does so many things so right it feels like the designer knew what I wanted in a game of this format.  It has to be said that it is rare that I discover new mechanics in a game but the "CB" CRT result is a brilliant feature which will take many games before I fully understand all the subtleties in how to use it and when.  The cards will make for a different experience every game; being a CDG devout, I find the combination of hex/cards/choices to be pretty darn close to perfect.

Nice and simple mechanics that really give the idea of what was happening.

You are the acting player in your turn but also in the enemy turn, with cards, counterblows and counterattaks.

Simply the best game I've played in ages. There is something about this one that just draws me back again and again...

A true 10/10.

A great grand-strategic where the East Front is very well transcribed :
- German advance early in the game (Blitzkrieg and surprise)
- Gradual improvement of Soviet units ("education" and increasing resources of the Red Army)
- Weather conditions (mud, snow and long winter must be taken into account in one strategy)
- Struggle for controlling Caucasus and Roumanian (Ploesti) oil fields
- Courland cauldron
- Soviet steamroller more and more overwhelming (red wave)
- More and more weaken German army until the end of the game
- Last troops brought into the war (Volkssturm, Berlin Garrison, etc ...)

A coherent package with only a twenty units on each side.

Impressive narrative and awesome gameplay.

[i]Mar 2, 2012:[/i] A fantastic design that captures the grand scale of the war in the East: from the sweeping maneuvers to the and horrific attrition. This game is unforgiving of missteps. There are some heartstopping moments when the fate of the war and tens of thousands of troops rest on the roll of a die...
All of this on a beautiful yet easy to use map with less than a hundred counters (and down to a few dozen  for the short scenarios).

There are rules aplenty. Yet the crunchy bits are generally easy to understand. It took a couple of readthroughs of the rulebooks plus a couple of sessions to get familiar all the "chrome" and to minimize any errors in play. 
I still had plenty of questions about the interactions between the rules (the rules on the cards were unclear at times. From reading the responses here on the geek, some of the cards didn't reflect the designers true intent.

Would have been nice to have fully illustrated cards. A  flaw that is easily overlooked as all components are well done.

A rating of '8+' after first two games. This is on track to be a '9+' and one of my all time favorites.

A really outstanding East Front game.  At first look it seems impossible that such small counter density could do justice to the whole East Front, but this really delivers high quality narrative.

Beautiful components with a map that fits on my drafting table with large easy to read counters.  I play a lot of SPI titles and the counters are just HUGE. Love them.

As many others have commented.  This has the appearances of being a simple game due to low counter numbers, map size and rule page count but oh so deceiving.  I struggled for a week attempting to play the first scenario without error, which is mostly all on me. The forum page and designer support resolves the issues I had (related to correct card play) to the point I can play mostly error free.  

After about 10+ solitaire sessions my opinion is this is a must-have for any wargamer interested in the Eastern Front genre.  This is now my go to game when travelling and supported by an excellent Vassal module.

The game really evokes the unique flavor of each side in the conflict, and their own desperate situation. The Russians practically don't have an army to begin with and must fight tooth and nail to hold the Germans at bay. On the other hand, the Germans are fighting against father time and he's a real mean SOB. Every German success feels like a stab to the heart for the Russian player while at the same time feeling well short of what's needed for the German player.  And then the game hits the half way mark and there's no stopping the Russian juggernaut; only a desperate attempt to slow it down. The *flow* of the game feels just right.

It looks solid, but what initially seems like an approchable game, has a thick chrome undercoating that creates so many exceptions to the main rules.

But you really have that feel of making all of those strategic movements and the freedom to try out every short and longer term plan that i wish. the play is very asymmetric and reminds me a little bit of twilight struggle, with scripted stuff and victory-point track, and card based events for different sides and the epic feel of the game... awesome experience!

A miraculous blend of both old and new wargame design philosophies. I expected a good game, but not something on the order of this masterpiece. Carl Paradis has honored the old wargaming traditions of hexes, CRTs, and NATO emblems, while adding card play. Combined with that special GMT look, you have a game that takes the best of two worlds. More importantly he has made the greatest military conflict of all time into a relatively simple game that still stacks up as a fine simulation. I can think of no greater praise in the world of wargaming. If you have to own just one game on the Eastern Front this is the one.

Hum... do I like this? I'm not sure I understand how this is supposed to be played. We'll see. I'm quite tepid on this one for now. I hope to do a full blown campaign first so that I can understand fully the reversal of fortunes that was typical of this campaign. 

UPDATE
I'm getting to know the game a little better. I've played two campaigns, a lot of mistakes, each time the German had an easy walk to the park of Soviet Utter Defeat. 

Yet I was very focused when I played, so I guess the game grabbed me for good. It is strange, it takes me in a different way than PoG, but it has some tension to it. 

I'll play more. Thus my rating goes up!

UPDATE
I have to say, the rules are badly laid out, and there are too many crucial exceptions. 

I've played with most of the rules done right, and the Russians actually won tonight. That is the first time in 6 games we played. Not good!

I'm quite excited about the game, so I'd give it an "8", yet the rules really bug me - as still I don't know if everything's done right - so I'll turn this down to "7.5". 

An other thing that is irking me, is that if the Germans get less mud and more clear weather, there's no way the Russians will win. I'm starting to think that it all boils down to how the weather goes in the campaign!
I hope I'm very wrong - and by every mean please contradict me - otherwise the game's broken. 

UPDATE
Ok, I was wrong, if the Russians get a lot of mud they can still lose badly!!! As I demonstrated amply in my last game. :p

Turning this game to "8".

Meh.  Rules were not as clear as they could be and the lack of organized / competitive play made this a non-starter for me.  Developer seems to have done all his playtesting by himself and rulings seem to be very 'weak'.  Great production quality, however, and this is probably a good introductory game.

Got to love the fact the designer bitches you out if he disagrees with your rating.  It's cute - considering he is inflating his own rating, I believe my rating to be fair.  Of course he will vote it a ten, but now on top of the game being garbage, everyone should know the designer will reach out to you and question your rating with some "no so pleasantries."  He also may reach out to the mods/admins to whine about it further, if he is unhappy about your replies.  This all may or may not have happened in my experience.

RATING: 4
Very poor: Strategic - Eastern Front - Easy

This Rating says EVERYTHING about me and NOTHING about the game. 

It is a great design and actually quite fun but it is not my cup of tea -at all as I am too much of a historian.

Beautiful components, Slick design but this game is obviously not for me; Barbarossa with only 3 units defending is just too much for me. I could-, and should have known this beforehand but still I bought it; sometimes you just need proof in order to confirm a feeling.

I really wanted to like it but scale is not for me.
So Nothing against the design as it is very well done but EastFront Corps level is as big as it gets for me.
Why? I already mntioned it above; Barbarossa with 3 Russian units on the board is just not my idea of a wargame.

Traded.

RATING: 10
Wow a lot of Russian Front experience in a streamlined package. The thrust of the Axis followed by the slow grind under the weight of the Russian counter thrust is elegantly handled and is edge of the seat gripping gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It has a few nice ideas such as counterblows. But the rather crude CRT, card events and exploitation rules together with the extremely low unit density often turn the game into a chaotic fest.

At least it plays fast, but other not much more complex wargames like for example CG's Eastfront or even the classic AH's Russian Campaign are strategically richer and provide a more nuanced insight into the historical challenges (notably logistics, attrition and manoeuvre) that both sides had to confront.

Has been surpassed by the more streamlined "hold fast russia".
I don't like CDGs too much & Hold fast Russia delivers the exact same story & feel with a third of the rules.
There are quite a lot of different special units and each has some extra rules. I'd rather had a greater variaty of gameplay than all those rules for special units.
Overall the turns can seem a little scripted, but everything is plainly written on the turn track, so you're able to take most of the events into consideration (even when new to the game).
Retells the story of the barbarossa campaign, with all the mayor turning points.

Initial rating after my first campaign game. I resigned during T14 as the Germans, but I am quite fond of the combat system (CAs and CBs). Further, I am impressed how well this game works with the small number of counters. Cards are always nice too (I am coming from the CDG world of "not-really wargames" like TS, 1989 etc. but am recently more into hex-and-counter wargames. I really look forward to playing this game again!

Light fast playing game of the East Front.  I feel the cards make it so it can't be taken too seriously.  They can really change the way things play out imho.

Feels very new and fresh. I like it.

RATING: 9.5
Seems to be a fast playing Eastfront game. I agree with all the other comments about the production value, the gamecomponents are impressing! Having a few solo games under my belt (without using the solitaire rules), this great little game has left very good impressions. I'm quite sure this game will get considerable tabletime because it's the most compact Eastfront game I own but nevertheless it gives a grand scale feeling.

After a few games my rating went up from 8,5 to a solid 9. This really is a great game! And the support from the gamedesigner (Carl Paradis) is superb!

After another couple of games I decided to scale up my rating to an incredibly (but well deserved) 9.5.

First try. Relatively simple rules and low counter density make for a manageable East Front game. It's a shame that there are already some rules errata including for card text, but give it a couple more months and the rules should settle down nicely. There seems to be surprisingly high scope for player decision-making given that this is a low complexity wargame.

5. Card influenced system that handles a vast array of events from replacements, to
    scorched earth to winter offensives to effects on individual battles.

2 plays Barbarossa scenario only

Impressive hex and counter game of the WW2 Eastern Front.

Nicely integrated and streamlined systems mesh well. The card play is good, with tough decisions over whether to use them to rebuild damaged and/or destroyed units, force the enemy to attack where he doesn't want to, or use them as events. The dominant role of armour as an offensive arm is well managed too.

It's not particularly simple (supply, combat, weather, minor allies, changing effectiveness of the opposing armies and their supporting economies through the war are all factored in), but due to the low counter density it's not overwhelming and (for a hex and counter wargame) it playes relatively quickly. (Some h'n'c monsters are pretty much unplayable for anyone without a parallel life to dedicate to them simply due to the number of chits in play and the array of options to be assimilated each turn).

While I've not played the full tournament game, I like the idea that (in effect) the German sets a VP total in the first half of the game that the Soviet has to beat in the second half to win. I suspect the German has a choice around how aggresively he wants to play - attack hard to build a good VP haul at the risk of wearing down your forces, or play more cautiously to preserve your army but leave the Soviet with a lower target to hit.

GMT's production quality is superb, with an clear and attractive board, good full colour player aids, thick laminated  cards and large, well-cut counters with rounded corners (as opposed to the more usual square chits that have to be carefully separated and trimmed). Kudos too for the great support from the designer Carl here on BGG - he picks up and responds to queries and comments very quickly and in a very open manner.

2016-12-17 - Preliminary rating of 9 after one play.  My goodness, what a blast!  The Germans achieved a sudden death victory on turn 6.  They had some decent cards - clear weather through the first three turns was certainly a help - and the dice seemed to go the way of the Reich.  But!  The Russians were definitely poorly played due to inexperience.  It was a great learning experience and I cannot wait to get it back to the table again.

Just received from GMT, had not played the VPG version.  Played two scenarios and already love this game!  Carl says in his designer notes that he loved The Russian Campaign as a teenager in the 1970s, and so did I.  

In that same TRC spirit, but with modern wargaming innovations (such as use of event cards), No Retreat is a fun, playable, engaging game.  It gives a good feeling of the epic sweep of the Eastern Front, without requiring an epic investment of time.  Congratulations and thanks, Carl!

RATING: 5
Not actually a bad game, I only rated it a 5 as I just found it rather boring and simply didn't leave the impression I look for in an east front campaign. On a pure design basis it should get at least an 8 as the rules are clear and I found no problems. This game would probably work much better for someone that is specifically looking for a small low unit density game.

Most of the time between both sides there seems to be about a dozen counters on the map. The situation feels more like a puzzle than an epic struggle. 

I'd definitely rather play the old GDW 1941 as it in 3 hours gives more than a hint at the east fronts grand scale.

The components for the GMT edition are excellent (great counters) but I'm still not sold on needing mounted maps for wargames.

Seeing that there is a North Africa game out with this system I'll add it to my list to check out. My complaint about the lack of unit density or scale for the eastern front certainly doesn't hold up for the African campaign.

The low counter density makes for a very simple game - which belies the many rules for such a small game.  It simply did not engage me or my opponent.  Glad it's his game.  No opportunity for sweeping encirclements.  Just move adjacent to the Russians, roll the die, and remove the Russians.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Combines a surprisingly large scale with rather rich historical flavor.  A very fine accomplishment indeed, attributable in large part to two design elements: heavily card-assisted play (but not card-driven) that does not overwhelm play but adds historical flavor and Soviet unit enhancement over time that enables the use of the same counters.  This is the first Eastern Front WWII game that I've wanted to replay frequently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fantastic components, large chits, flexible strategies allowed. Not recommended as first hex wargame (Holdfast: Russia 1941-1942 is probably a better pick) but great for seasoned grognards who want to play a fun game but don't have time for a monster.

update - although in general the rules were well organized and easy enough to follow, the incorrect or missing information made me scratch my head and sigh. Subtracted a point for that but it is still a good system and fun game.

update - nit pick -- really wish the board was organized differently the chart boxes aren't divided up half facing south for one player and half facing north for the other player... just seems a bit random.

GMT Deluxe Edition! It combines three games into one: No Retreat! No Surrender! and Na Berlin! (Na Berlin counters only.  The rules come with the next C3i magazine). The hard mounted map reminds me of the days of Russian Campaign.  The rulebook is colorful to read and the different location of the colors helps me to memorize and locate the appropriate rules.  What's not to like? Both the map and the cards could have been more juicier with this "Deluxe" edition.  I have bought the illustrated cards graphics of which are handpicked by the designer.  Besides, there have already been some important errata in the scenario book as far as I have seen and played (e.g. Operation Saturn).  I like the box cover art absolutely though.  An elegant, fun and 2-players competitive game design. The game actually reminds me of Stalin's War, now a masterpiece in my book, with the similar unit level and the same card like Industrial Evacuation for showing its effects on life. With so many eastern front games in my collection, I am still not tired to try the next!  Check out my many AARs here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/73403/games-scheduled-to-play-8

I am reading the book Stalin's Folly - the tragic first 10 days of WWII on the Eastern Front by Cinstantine Pleshakov. Getting to know the Russian paper-like defense with ghost divisions or fronts, continuing suicidal orders to "counterattack", miscommunication among the fronts commanders, diving stukas, refugee chaos, strategic errors on attacking-defensive posture of unit deployments on the frontline, and the vast land for German panzers and assault group in-between the border and Minsk, I now realize the initial OOBs in No Retreat is one of authentic and the map is scale-right for the single Soviet unit here and there.....! No Retreat is a game that overthrows our established perception of the war since John Edwards's proper "front" and Frank Chadwick's pro-Soviet unit strength! 

In No Retreat, it was the vast defenseless USSR territory that made the Soviets impossible to draw a line to defend unless right before Moscow where forest hexes around were protective to the infantry. In Stalin's War, it was the German superb offensive and excellent operational flexibilities and doctrines that won them at the initial stage of the war.

Reglas sencillas y efectivas. Una pega que veo es que a veces los eventos de las cartas hacen que el juego no vaya tan fluido, al tener que ir leyendolos y deciediendo si usarlos o no. Supongo que el tiempo se reducirá una vez que se conozcan los eventos y los "interiorice", y no tenga que descifrarlos cada vez que tocan.

Have only briefly pulled this out so far. I really like the idea. I'm not a fan of the continuing rules changes. Which edition are we on now?  And rules changes that effect cards in the game?  Am I supposed to write on the cards?  Disappointing that this many rules changes were made to what is essentially the second edition of the game.  Carl seems great - and to really want to make this a perfect game. I guess I take something of the same opinion to games that I do to books. Once you publish it, it should be done.  Don't revise a novel later. Don't revise the rules later, unless there is something egregious that needs to be dealt with in the rules.

Edit: I know the above is basically unfair to the wargame genre. But it does make it difficult for people to get into the genre.  I've read two or three versions of the rules now--but I haven't even looked at the living rules.

After 3 plays F2F and much more solo study. Many innovative ideas in a solid frame that all grognards should try. A pity the rules are not clear enough, and the lack of a good player aid, but the game is wonderful!

New version of the rules make things clerer and fix some issue on play balance (but you can notice such issues only after repeated play)

Time passed and always wanting to play this... Vote raised!

Big thumbs up for this operational game, finally one that I really like. Some of the veteran wargamers say this is light and I say I would never teach it to a newbie.

How much do I love this game? I rarely buy a wargame and think 'wow, what a bargain!', but I sure had that thought when I got the deluxe version of 'No Retreat' at my nearby hobby store. Beautiful very thickly mounted board, terrific counters, and such a nice game. $60 happily spent. I'm not sure where this one falls on my pantheon of strategic east front games (my two favorites before this are The Russian Campaign and Columbia's East Front), but No Retreat! can compete and not fear comparisons. Rules are a little loose, but I can work with that problem when the game is so enticing. One caveat: this is a playable, low piece density east front game, but don't go into it thinking it's a beginner wargame. It's not all that complicated, but wargaming newbies may become frustrated.

A high quality game, although some aspects of the rules are not as clear as I was expecting from a game regarded as being fairly straight forward.

These may seem like criticisms, but the game itself is a blast to play and ties you up in knots.

Tentative solitaire play rating of Case Blue.  A bit more rules heavy than I was expecting - not a bad thing.

Looking forward to a proper solitaire playing with the pdf expansion.  How much I enjoy it will hinge on whether this goes up for trade or not.

A terrific wargame, probably one of the best I have ever played. Allows you to play the full Eastern Front campaign in one or two sessions, with easy to learn rules that, at the same time, are difficult, and rewarding, to master.

Superb materials, various scenarios, solitaire-friendly...

A must have.

I'm not an East Front aficionado, nor do I ever care to become one. It's just not my favourite topic for war games. No Retreat! however is an excellent game. I had a blast playing this. The newest GMT iteration is big, beautiful and playable. IT's not too counter heavy and the counters are large and easily handled. If I play any east front game it'll be this one again. It's extremely well paced and the combat isn't overly complex.

Fantastic game.  I'm impressed how much depth of gameplay there is with such few pieces.  History is hardwired into the design, dispensing the need for gobs of counters or added complexity.  This just may replace The Russian Campaign as my favorite WWII game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Production is really nice, especially when combined with large hexes. I was surprised that the game was a little more involved than I had imagined. It feels like this should be an easier game than it is to get under your belt. For my first couple of playings, the rulebook was in my hands a lot of the time.

I play both solitaire and face to face but have never been a real fan of games with cards as I find 'managing' cards a distraction to play. I realise that many will not agree and as a design choice, it has been well executed.

I like the counter attack / counterblow idea, although like the rules that cover victory points, things seem to get into a tangle at times in my mind. It is not that the rules are badly written (they certainly are not), I think it more to do with the fact that counterblow can result in several different situations and that legislating for each is not easy.

There are quite a lot of little rules tucked away here and there which is necessary to cover the 5 years of this dynamic war and thankfully various play aids have been thoughtfully designed to makes these important rules easier to remember (better than most other games). Also of help is the rule section (13.5) that specifically reminds you what happens on the various game turns.

There is quite a bit of nice stuff going on, such as the subtle way that the Soviet army improves and there are some things that feel odd, such as it can be better not to defend in a city to prevent the enemy forcing you to attack out from it at a big disadvatage - though the overall effect of the 'eastern front' works.

The game seems to follow the historical path of the war nicely and there is a real feel that a ton of work has gone into the game and Carl the designer has had a superb presence in supporting this game both here and at Consimworld (probably the best post game support that I have seen). I think you need to read the rules and plentiful examples a few times and have a practice game to get most things set in your mind. 

I always enjoy the tight fight for Moscow in Barbarossa games and this games does it well, with a tension existing for both sides. Leningrad and Sevastapol both seem appropriately difficult to get.

I think playing a bit more may result in my rating rising a bit.

I tried this and reserved my rating - it was not my cup of tea, however, I figured I would give it another go before rating it.  Then, the designer chose to be offensive and elitist to a friend, the person I tried this with.  I don't think the PM's were warranted, and to be honest, were quite ridiculous.

I was sceptical that a full-on east front campaign would work with a low unit/counter density, but No Retreat is a good game with plenty of satisfying simulation to boot. In fact, I enjoy the use of a CRT with less counters as it cuts down on the ratio counting.  And the CRT is a good one (or good two –with one for the Soviets and one for the Axis) -I like the counterblow and counterattack results and all that they simulate.

Good game no doubt, it is fun, plays fast, there is nothing really shocking historically with the way the war unfolds, good replayability etc...

Sure it is probably a bit overhyped but the main problem for me is that at the end of the day, after I have just finished a scenario or the campaign, I am like : ok now that was kinda fun but let's play something meatier. Finally, some of the mechanisms feel a bit too gimmicky maybe and for a second edition the rules shouldn't have so many erratas.

A high-level (army/fronts) hex and counter game with a low counter density, around 20 on the board per player. Great fun and the two sides play very differently, the initial surge into Russia by the Axis forces is brutal but as the winter months appear their advance slows and the Russians can hit back hard.

There are a lot of little rules that add a lot of theme but mean that you’ll be referencing the rules a lot in your first few plays. I wouldn’t do away with these as I feel that they make a big part of why I like this game. I can see me playing this for some time.

RATING: 9
Deluxe version of the No Retreat games with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union from Barbarossa to Berlin with classic counters and hex map. The Russians have the tougher job, not only do they have to survive the inital oneslaught, but must jump several hurdles to avoid a German victory by reconquering lost ground at a better pace than they lost. The 1945 scenario is also tough for them as the German defences are difficult to penetrate. Still they get plenty of reinforcements, replacements and upgrades. Be warned that wiping the enemy army from the Baltic to the Black Sea does not stop a fair chunk of it reforming in the next turn.

Really enjoyed this game. Love reading about the history behind this. Had a hard time learning the rules initially, but after that it seems rather simple once I got into it. Need to get more plays in of this to reinforce the rules in my head.

Hopefully I can get Jen to play this with me. Campaign seemed really long though since we got through 3 turns in 1.5 hours. Given though it was a learning game and I had to explain rules. Could see that being brought down to 20-30 minutes for 3 turns.

The game is quick to setup and delivers a lot of fun in the  playing process. I think the chrome in this game makes all the difference because it sets very well historically. I almost feel the pressure of the Germans, the fragile Soviets, I hear the Fortresses being built, the blitz attacks, the shock armys, the mud in the tanks and the freezing long winter.  
The components are gorgeous. GMT made a high quality in this one.
Carl Paradis made a superb game...
Can´t wait for the African Campaign!

After a couple more games:

No Retreat! The Russian Front is a superb game. The low counter density and the different aspects that change each turn (weather, events, blitz markers, shock markers, placements and so on) gives the game a historical approximation that evolve each player. The event cards adds different approaches in applying the strategies involved. The conditions to win are very engaging like the sudden death and the conquer of the "green" objectives. 
Allied to all this, I must reinforce the great quality of the components.
This game is by  now a classic. Play it solo, PBEM or live in skype using vassal. To finish you must play it face to face to have good fun.
Get it!

Improved from 9.5 to 10. 
Why?

If you want a game on this front that can be played and enjoyed in a reasonable time frame then this is it. A superb game. The best No Retreat game produced thus far…not as fiddly as its followers on other fronts…it has its own genius and just works so well. If I want to play a campaign and have the time I might go for The Dark Valley…but if I want the whole war on this front then this for me is the way to go…thank you Carl for this superb gem of a game.

The second of the series I got (first one was 'The Italian Front'). Played few times so far, but I can say it's an amazing game. Has simpler rules than "The Italian Front" (good if you're starting with wargames).  I've played with my 12 years old kid and we had a lot of fun together. 
Just like "NRIF", this game also has very nice components. Also the designer included the possibility of choosing if your armored units will have a tank or the NATO standard on them. Both sets are in the box, so you choose the one you like the most (that was awesome!). 
Being really honest, I personally prefer "The Italian Front" because I have a personal connection with that front - after all, a Brazilian division fought on Italy under US 5th Army command, but this game (The Russian Front) is amazing! Choose this one if you want to start playing right after opening the box. "The Italian Front" shares the same mechanics and adds some more. Start with this one. and you'll have a lot of fun. When you get tired of this title, then get "The Italian Front" (i don't know other games from the series, so I cannot say anything about them - I assume they're as good as NRRF and NRIF).

Currently the best game simulating the war on this front at this scale imho. The scale is perfect. It plays fast. Has a low unit count but manages to simulate the conflict beautifully. Seeing 7 Soviet units hold back the Germans using elegant zone of control and supply rules is refreshing. I'm tired of giant 1000 counter 100+ hour games that do the same thing that this game did. The use of cards has been a great modern twist on the old classics I haven't played classic Hex/CRT/ZOC games for a long time but this one pulled me back in and won't let go.

RATING: 7
A modern, creative take on the hex-and-counter wargame. Cards and counterblows give the game some flavour and variability. And though it's not nearly as fast a game as advertised (took us 3.5 hours to play out the first year of the war), it comes close to the holy grail of a single-session East Front game.

However, it's still a low-density wargame with odds tables. Which means it's very chess-like. So I have concerns that the early game, especially, could be vulnerable to perfect-move analysis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Takes a few games to get a feel for the mechanics and exceptions. Not an intro wargame despite the low counter density. Always seems to take much longer to play than I expect but that said the time passes and you realise you've enjoyed great swathes of the Eastern Front conflict in that time. A bit of a modern classic and well worth a try if you're at all interested in Eastern front WWII.

Fun game, good physical quality, with lower unit count and thus shorter turns than East Front (my main game to compare with No Retreat). So that's good.

But it has some interesting-but-weird mechanisms which take some getting used to (e.g. the confusing counterblow stuff; the whole initiative thing of "we're tracking only German VPs until the middle of the game, then we're tracking only Soviet VPs"; the confusing business about Soviet units being 1-step but upgradable to their 2nd side, then becoming 2-step later in the game; different types of "white strength" units which are immobile fortifications or sometimes not; the needlessly complex explanation about tracking victory points and separate event victory points; etc) and lots of special case chrome to worry about (e.g. the myriad of special abilities for the two sides which become enabled and disabled in various circumstances depending on calendar time and weather, the difference between sea hexsides & lake hexsides matters but is never actually mentioned, etc). (EF has special case chrome as well, probably like all WW2 East front games, but it feels like more confusing weird details in NR to me.)

And as a fan of Combat Commander's excellent rules quality, I'm rather frustrated and disappointed by the much lower quality of NR's rulebook. Lots of different vagueness and unexplained things and blatant editing/proofreading errors. Basic stuff which should be covered isn't like about timing issues when cards are played in reaction to other cards and the usual ambiguities about "play anytime" type cards. So NR simply feels underdeveloped compared to CC. And there seem to be continual tweaks and changes to the system for various game balance and/or historical accuracy reasons, as well as to correct errors (in rules and in scenario info) or unclear rules.

Be sure to download and read GMT's "living rules" and not just play based on the paper rulebook. At least NR's Carl Paradis is fairly active in the forum here to answer questions, so that helps. I wish Chad Jensen had been hired to write/edit the rules, though... as it stands, it seems a good game trapped in a mediocre-at-best "work in progress" rulebook. I'd rate it higher if it had a good clear stable rulebook. Probably some wargamers are used to dealing with these issues and don't mind as much as I do.

RATING: 7
Neither hex-and-counter nor East Front games are my type of thing. However, I like the way the combination of cards, powerful ZOCs and counterblows make for a game with low counter density that distils the decisions to create several stark, tense choices undercut by a good deal of uncertainty.

There are lots of little rules to keep track of (esp. those relating to each turn) and the counterblow combat result is terribly explained. It feels like a simple pudding that has been over-egged. 

Nevertheless, it fits a perfect niche in my collection for an East Front strategic game, and I'm glad that I have it for the few occasions for when I'm in the mood for it.

I am enjoying it very much, the production values are tremendous. I do think the original VPG edition without expansions was more streamlined, being successful has let Carl put in all the chrome he had to develop out originally. But! If you understand the basics of the game well enough the chrome is not burdensome. New players may feel a bit overwhelmed (expecting a simpler game, which is in there buried a bit), but there are plenty of short (4-5 turn) scenarios which can play in 60-120 minutes.

UPDATE
Just started another game after a fairly long absence and was pleasantly reminded of how good it is. Still think the original VPG ruleset/deck was best, but if you play by 1st GMT edition rules with the "no German stacking" variant it's almost as good (and much easier than Carl's 2nd edition chrome-ups).

RATING: 9.5
Creative design with a fairly steep learning curve due to new mechanics and all the permutations of card play. Seems more complicated than advertised but really is quite simple in most regards.
If you are an East Front buff, you will probably like this even with a very low counter density and grand scale.
Designer attempts to capture the classic "Russian Campaign" feel and I think he was largely successful.   The designer's responsiveness to rules questions and clarifications is unbelievably fast and positive.

Just when you ask 'why another East Front WW2 game?' and 'what could anyone possibly do differently?', Carl comes in with No Retreat. A fine effort!

This game is a gem!

RATING: 9
Very impressive, and has made my collection of games treating the same material at the theater level largely obsolete.  (East Front aside, anyway.)  Plays very simply and smoothly, and yet is really able to capture the feel of the campaign thanks to the combination of card play, differing CRTs and the counterblow mechanic.  Everything is very subtle yet the play is quick and always interesting.  The lovely components are just icing on the cake.

Taught how to play from a friend. One of the first "hex and counter" style games that didn't immediately feel chess-like and math-y. The small tweaks for counter-blows and counter attacks in the combat tables add just a little variability to your standard add factors, compute ratios and roll a d6. Add in the card play and relatively easy rules (the VP conditions were a little confusing) and you have a really great game.

RATING: 7.5
The key to the Germans winning early (in Turns 3 or 6) seems to lie with a headlong blitzkrieg rush towards cities, along with a potential encirclement of multiple Soviet armies in the centre around the Pripyat Marshes. Bypassing Kiev and Sevastopol are key, since they take too much time to capture, whilst getting the Leningrad garrison to counter–blow a German infantry army adjacent to it is essential to capturing Leningrad. 

There are a couple of 1:1 attacks that need to be carried out, such as  by the Romanians in Turn 1 and the German counter–attack to the counter–blow from Leningrad, which really decides the fate of the German advance. If the German player is lucky enough to roll high on these few 1:1 attacks, they basically have won the game by VP conditions, because they'll be able to advance to a new defensive line on the Moscow–Rostov axis. The careful placement of Blitz markers is essential for making those 1:1 attacks viable with a right–hand column shift to 1.5:1. Even pushing too far forward for a long war, the Germans can defend the Moscow–Rostov axis until the Turn 6, where the Soviets won't be able to take back enough VP hexes to prevent a sudden death German victory. It's advisable to block off rail movement to the Crimea by garrisoning the hexes north of Sevastopol and east of Novorossiysk with some weak Romanian armies, otherwise the Soviets can rail move units there and potentially roll up the German rear.

If the Soviets survive until Turn 6, there's very little to stop the Soviet steamroller from breaking through the German line, as the Germans lose their Blitz markers and the Soviets gain Shock markers, along with a number of other bonuses.

An OK game I would give it a ten from the quality of the components and looks. It is a very well done game for the way it is designed to capture the subject of Eastfront WII. If I had to narrow my game collection down to ten games, it would be one I would want to have to cover the east front. I believe if I really wanted a east front (total war) fix I believe I would want go with a larger more detailed game. However, No Retreat fits into my schedule of playing time well. One can get a quick Eastfront fix playing it.

 I have no idea why a swamp hex was put on the map NE of Sevastopol. In only one game Red Star Rising I have seen swamp area in the Crimea P. and in RSR it was only one hex. Under my house rules I just play it as clear terrain. I highly recommend NR to wargamers who like Eastfront games and for gamers who don't have a lot of time to play. There still is a lot going on so I wouldn't call it an introductory game.

Would not have believed that a small scale( map size, armies and fronts ) East front game could be so much fun but No Retreat is that game. Great components and a mounted map compliment this outstanding package. Cards enhance the play of the game and you definitely get the feel of operations on the Russian front. Living rules were easy to digest and help make this a very playable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I can see that this is an excellent game design. There's a sparse simplicity that makes the game feel like chess (but with the layered uncertainty of dice rolls and card draws) and manages to simply distill the complexities of the Eastern front and evoke the back-and-forth (at least for the Barbarossa scenario I tried). But hex-level operational wargames aren't really for me -- due to the amount of open information I feel compelled to spend too much time optimizing low-level logistics. And also, the World War 2 theme feels a bit too real for me.

I rated this 1 lower than the original.  GMT really went all out in the production of this game so the rating suffered from lacking the two small scenarios that come with the original, a concept I love.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about pay the $20 and get The Victory Point games version as well.

The GMT version includes the two expansions which is why I picked it up, but there was something magical about the first edition.

So much is packed into a small number of components.  But it all makes sense and works well.  This is a game I can actually figure out and get to playing in short order.  "Eastfront" was my favorite game of this theater but it's looking like this game will replace it.  It is what "The Russian Campaign" was trying to be.

RATING: 9
Meets my criteria perfectly.  [b]Elegant, easy to set up, minimal rules, low counter density, deep game play, multiple paths to victory, amazing components, solitaire suitable and user friendly.[/b]  

I initially found counterblows very unintuitive, but with game experience now appreciate this very smart mechanic. Despite being a rather abstract game I dislike having the unrealistic terrain such as the forests around Moscow.  

Overall this is one of the best WW2 wargames I have played and currently sits in my top 5 games of all-time!

RATING: 10
Comments after a single game as the Axis, Barbarossa scenario. I could not get a single objective, partly due to inexperience, partly due to odds-defying dice results but mostly, to my opponent being Carl himself.

No Retreat is fast-paced, tensed and fun. Counterblows and Counterattacks make the game very dynamic. Chrome is subtly integrated and historical results are likely, although the players are free to explore other options. Small critic about the cards: I wished I did not have (and kept taking) so many Russian initiative cards I could not play for events - a very minor thing.

Overall, the game succeeds at something I thought impossible: with low counter density, simple rules and short playtime, it seems to retain all the fun factor and strategic depth of larger, more complex and longer games. 

Fantastic.

I give it a seven for innovation and the valiant attempt at a tight, elegant rule set, but the rules are a jumbled mess with many revision (not all in the same place, apparently).  I am intrigued enough to keep trying to make sense of them (and the designer is very responsive).

I want to play more to really understand the strategy, but my first session was very fun. Components are beautiful. Rules are more complex than at first glance, but many of the rules questions posted here and consimworld are easily found in the book. 

The designer does a great job of answering questions and personally should be lauded for the amount of professionalism he has had to exibit in some unfair assessments and comments from others.
In all fairness the game plays differently than most other wargames. It isn't broken or unbalanced;I'm still trying to figure out why this game elicits such strong emotions for and against. Its a winner in my book.

I wasn't expecting something as simple as Memoir '44, but I had heard this was an introductory wargame - suitable for newbies. So when I was wrestling with the rulebook I kept thinking "this is for newbies?"

After spending hours wrestling with the rules, we finally sat down to play. And then we spent half of the time checking the rulebook. An exhausting experience. I'm ready for more than M44, but not this. It looks fascinating, however, and will remain in my collection until I am no longer a newbie :-)

RATING: 9
What a fun game!  Carl Paradis (the designer) spent a lot of time twiddling with the rules after release, but having finally landed on 2.0 for the GMT version I have to say I'm as excited to play this game as any wargame in a long time (probably since Pursuit of Glory).

The new take on using cards in wargames is very welcome.  While the PoG-style games are fantastic in their own right, the way Carl uses cards in NR is (IMO) even more FUN and interesting.  The low chit count keeps the game moving along and makes it playable in a reasonable amount of table time, even for those like me who are burdened with slow opponents.

Bravo Carl!  Looking forward to the rest of the NR brood.

UPDATE:  Moved rating to "9" with the new 2nd edition rules.  Really enjoying this game--best new game for me since PuG/Hannibal, and not sure those two are better.

This is a great game, and the counterblow mechanic is a stroke of genius.  Tough going on the Russians in the first sixth months and tough going on the Germans for the rest.

Learn the differences between the combat tables, and let that inform your strategy. There are cards that can cancel an opponent's card play.  Hold one of these as the Russians until the Germans do something that will cost you the game.  You'll know it when you see it.

Jeu accessible mais dont les règles subtiles créent beaucoup de réflexion (en particulier le concept de counterblow). Pas mal de tension et très intéressant.

Rating based on five solo and one FTF game (may go up or down with further plays).  So far very impressed. Quick playing and tense.

The Victory conditions do appear to encourage the Germans to hold cities when tactically it may be better to withdraw (very hisitorical), few East Front games have this essential ingrediant

The cards really add an extra dynamic and work brilliantly

Raised my rating to a 10 because this game is way too much fun.  I have officially made it a permanent part of my collection by using a highlighter in the rulebook.   It also plays very well solo with or without the expansion.  The expansion does change things up a bit and gives a little fog of war.  I like playing the game without variable weather, and without cadres.  I also use the counterblow advance optional rule.

I always liked war games, but they were usually so complicated that finding players was almost impossible. Not mentioning the hours long setup. This is were No Retreat comes in. With small amount of counters, quick setup, and rules not that comlex and yet very deep, this game has one me over. It's still not easy to find players, but it's an example of great design. The scripted gameplay keeps it away from 10 in my books, but it's still great.

2 plays. Bumped rating from 8 to 9. I really enjoy this game so far. Rules aren't complex but there is a lot going on and some degree of exceptions to keep track of. I would rate e.g. Paths of Glory as a simpler game. The part about Counterattacks and Counterblows took a few re-reads and the victory track also took a little time to grasp. Very quick to set up and play. Well structured rulebook and very easy to use during play.

GMT version. Like the idea more than the game. The map size and graphics I find a bit ridiculous, although that matte finish is superb. Something in the model doesn't seem quite right, or perhaps it just isn't evocative of the subject for me. I guess I'm just out of sync with modern designs. Will most likely give it another try at some point though.

RATING: N/A
Played a couple solo games and am in middle of one PBEM. I have to really admire the creativity and rethinking on display here.

I think this is viewed as an introductory wargame (mostly due to nice components and low counter density), but it's really a medium complexity, "dense" game. Nearly every piece and location matters, and the rules and implications are tricky. 

One thing that doesn't matter quite as much as I'd expected (hoped) is the role of the cards: they are very situational, and with replacements being so necessary, it's very hard to get the events to line up at the right time. So you burn through them and their text is 90% irrelevant. Some of that may be my newbie-ness, but I'm doubtful I'm overstating it too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The messy rulebook kills the game for me. Don't be fooled by how nice it reads. Rulebooks that are nice reads often are horrible to look something up in them, and this is their poster child. I've played the game four times (short scenarios) and I've always spent at least half an hour (usually longer) looking stuff up in the FAQs and forums, and sometimes even after that I couldn't find an answer. I don't consider myself a beginner wargamer, I can handle Here I Stand, OCS and other games considered more complicated than this.

Edit: a new rulebook has been posted on GMT. Perhaps there is hope.

It's one of the best wargames I've ever played. It's an incredibly elegant and intelligent design which reflects perfectly the grand level warfare on the Eastern Front. Players are not overburdened with too many counters, so they can focus on the strategic aspects of the gameplay. Thanks to the counterblow mechanics and cards, the combat is unpredictable and fluid, so it's an excellent game to play solo, even without the special solo mechanics. To be honest I constantly manage to surprise myself :) The rules are not very complex, but they require a little different mindset in comparison to more typical designs. The first edition of the game suffered from many discrepancies in the manual, but they all have been fixed in the third edition. Apart from that, the game designer is happy to resolve all the doubts on the BGG forum.   
  
All in all, I cannot recommend this game highly enough.

Still wrapping my head around this game - fairly easy to get into this game but will take some plays to get strategy down. Playing the solo variant. Certainly one of my favorite Eastern Front games and without the level of detail and rules weight of other titles - but with the same punch. A hit.

RATING: 7
Solid design but I personally don't like it. It's too long to play the whole campaign. Germans are too strong in the beginning, and although designer amended this, some people still play by old rules. Many situations are too gamey - I am looking at you Soviet infantry, training and detraining to escape a German attack in the middle of semi surrounded city. I guess ultimately me and the game designer disagree on how close the Germans were to winning the war. Carl thinks they were very close, I think opposite. To give Germans overwhelming advantage is wrong, considering they lost the war. Yes, initially they were winning, but so were Carthaginians versus Rome yet you dont see Hannibal with 7 cards versus Rome's 0 to simulate that war's beginning...

It's almost too bad I learned Unconditional Surrender! before No Retreat! and not the other way around. They have many things in common and I can't help but keep comparing the two. In my book, USE wins in almost every way that matters: rules system, art, style, immersion, clarity, focus, replayability, etc. Yet No Retreat! has its own merits. My clumsy fingers love the big, thick and rounded counters - no tweezers required! The card deck certainly offers exciting twists and can even reverse a desparate situation. Beautifully balanced, victory may very well depend on the last die roll or card play.

I LOVE this game! Not only are the components superb, but it's a fun, fast paced, simple, yet challanging game. I think newbies would have a little learning curve, but nothing overwhelming.

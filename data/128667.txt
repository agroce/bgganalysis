RATING: 7
Somehow, I feel the game manages to feign strategy but is almost entirely luck.  Game play is very fun and engaging at first, but after a few games, I find that everyone uses all the cards they have anyway and whoever gets the right cards wins...  Still a fun game with interesting hidden teammate mechanic.

If you like "Bang," but hate the elimination mechanic, Samurai Sword is it.  It's the same game as Bang, but with different results if you're wounded too much.  The Italian worked on the Bang cards, here it's a little strange.

RATING: 7.5
In some ways, it's better than Bang. The fact that there is no player elimination and it's actually easier to win as a Ronin (Renegade-equivalent) makes it feel more balanced. There's also a definite end condition even if no one stays dead. The terminology is a bit funky though. Still, I'd probably prefer this to Bang, but I already have Bang and it's not different enough for me to get this too. But if I could do it again, I'd probably take this over Bang.

A very similar experience to [b]Bang![/b].  It has--in my opinion--fixed some of the problems in the [b]Bang![/b] ruleset, creating more fluid play.  But it just doesn't have a theme as good as a Spaghetti Western.  Cherry blossoms and hearts aren't as exciting as bullets and dynamite.

1st play: This game is similar to BANG! with a samurai theme, which is a huge plus for me as I enjoy samurai themed games. It was longer than it needed to be, and the "harmless" state really slowed the game down.

2nd play: the game played much faster this time, but still relied too much on random card draw, and the honor point system means allegiances are less necessary. Meh.

I've played this more than Bang! for unknown reasons, but they are very similar.  It's a hidden-role game of hand management with lots of "take that" play and asymmetrical powers.  The range mechanic is tough for some people to remember at first, but the rules are pretty easy once you get going.  It plays best with 6.  The ronin adds a lot.

UPDATE: the dice game is so much better

A Japanese retheme of Bang! I think that Samurai Sword has solved 2 problems that troubled me with Bang! First of all there is no player elimination. The game uses a VP system so when someone kills you he takes one of your VP and you are still in the game. Second the fugitive role (here it is called Ronin) can now actually win the game. Apart from these changes the game is pretty much the same.  If you like Bang! you will propably love this.

Samurai Sword is one of the worst games we have played. The the points just go round and round, changing hands, and the game drags on forever. The game we played lasted 2 hours and only ended because the Shogun team went on a suicide mission to end the game. I got this because I thought the lack of elimination was better... not so. It only makes a never ending game.

Samurai Sword is definately closely related to Bang. It differs from Bang in a few ways:
- No player elimination until the end of the game.
- There is a stronger incentive to be visible to your team.
- Players can become "harmless" which means other players can't attack them.

If you have Bang, you do not really need Samurai Sword.

Possibly my favorite implementation of the BANG! card fight system, the variety of weapons, properties and other card effects reflects the struggles of feudal Japan, the artwork is nice, and the characters are pretty cool. It does an excellent job of moving the fast card mechanics out of the Wild West.

This is Bang! with some minor tweaks (which I think make the game worse, but I haven't played Bang in a long time so take this with a grain of salt). I think the western theme served the game better too. Another thing which I'm not 100% sure but I think that Bang! was shorter. One thing that speaks for this version however is that there is no player elimination.

This is a great variant to the popular BANG! system. There's enough of the mechanics of that game to pick up the rules and play quickly, but it feels almost like a different game while taking your turns.

One nice thing about this game is that everyone is in it until the end. The other nice thing is that games are snappy, fun, and end just as things become a bit settled. my first ended before the first run through the card deck.

The mechanics for Honor and Life Points are really inspired and quite set it apart from BANG! all on their own. Interesting scoring depending the number of players and their roles clinch it.

The card art is also very nice and neatly side-steps looking like anime—shich I find refreshing in a light, Japan-themed game.

For fans of BANG!, bump this rating up a point or two.

RATING: 5
So, this is bang! with samurai instead of cowboys, so if you like the original you might like this too. I'm fairly ambivalent on the original, but I thought the Japanese theme might be enough to raise this up a bit, combined too with the removal of the player elimination that tarnishes Bang for so many. Alas, it's still just a pretty dull game, that goes on for faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar too long, so long for what it is in fact, that by the end you don't really care who wins as long as it's over. Given a huge haircut, this might work as a quick-playing card game, but as it stands, I won't be back to this one if I can help it.

Aunque tras un par de rondas casi todo el mundo sabe quién es quién, a partir de 5 jugadores la presencia del Ronin añade un punto de incertidumbre y desconfianza hacia los ataques de los ninjas o los samuráis.

Toma lo mejor del sistema BANG! y lo mejora, haciendo que la partida termine cuando un jugador sea eliminado. Este punto hace que nadie se quede horas fuera de la mesa mientras los demás terminan su partida de BANG!

Turns out that removing player elimination from Bang doesn't turn it into a better game. It felt longer and more contrived, and there's nothing like the frustration of sitting there with attack cards in your hand when everyone else has empty hands so you basically just pass and get beat up on again until your turn rolls around again where everyone has empty hands and you pass and...

So much better than Bang! without the elimination part which instantly killed the game for me the first time I played it. That would be fine if the game lasted 10 minutes but it can go on for a while so the changes with rejuvenating life points and the honour system breathes life into this game for me. I also prefer this theme although they are both just skins so it's really a matter of taste in artwork, as most theming is.

Totally under-rated game IMO. Everyone of course compares this with Bang (because it was based on the mechanics). And yes, I agree it does have some flaws, but what game doesn't?
This game is fast and requires deduction of player roles, which is fun, but has NO player elimination! You loose all your health and then you come right back for more! It's great in a big group of people 5-7. Everyone gets to play, and it's so simple to pickup and teach.
Lots of tension, and lots of targeting individuals, or alliances. Roles usually get figured out 1/2way through the game. I did have a few games where no one could figure out who I was..... I played very shifty.... although I lost in the end.

This is a good game when you have a lot of people that want to play a game together.  In fact you really need a minimum of six people to have a good time.  Its more of a party game and really about just sitting back and having a good time with friends rather than focusing on winning or concentrating on mechanisms or mechanics.  The hidden identity roles work very well, especially in the beginning of the game when you are just trying to deduce who everyone is and the game eventually morphs into a team against team game (and thus in some ways becomes cooperative).    
This game is immensely better than its predecessor “Bang!”: much more streamlined and plays faster (and no player elimination here).   
The only issue I really had with the game was the English text on the cards.  The English grammar is a little iffy in places and not very clear.  The publishers/designers need to take some lessons from the people who write the directions on the Dominion cards to make their explanations more clear and precise as to what each card does.  And while the Italian text may be relevant to the original “Bang!”, here its just distracting and doesn’t make any sense with the theme (putting extra text in Japanese would actually make more thematic sense).  They really need to remove the Italian text and give some extra space to explain in clearer and more precise English what each card does (no ambiguity allowed).

A.K.A. Bang 2.0.

The Bang formula remains the same but Samurai Sword adds a nice small change that solves the issue of Bang! potentially dragging on.

Players are dealt 'honour points,' each time a player is slayed they give an honour point to the victor; each time the deck runs out and has to be reshuffled all players discard an honour point.  The game ends when any player or players lose all their honor points.  This means two things, i) The game has an artificial timer to end the game ii) Players are not as readily eliminated as they are with Bang! or Bang! The Dice Game.

When the game ends players add up their honour points with a the appropriate multipliers; Samurai add with the Shogun, Ninjas add their scores together and the Ronin scores alone.  If a player is eliminated by another player that team suffers a penalty to their overall score.

The new system works well mechanically but to me the game also takes a bit of a hit to the tension as the traditional carnage of trying to take down the Shogun (aka Sheriff) doesn't carry the same weight and a points victory is not as satisfying as the last man (or men) standing.  The flip-side being that the game doesn't drag with someone sitting out for half an hour so make of that what you will.

The Ronin's (aka Renegade too) role feels somewhat diminished as the wildcard and deciding factor in the game that eagerly flips sides to their own gain and cast doubt as they now just want honour points, it doesn't matter from who or how.  They aren't trying to keep the Shogun alive, just long enough to get in an epic final duel.  

The artwork is gorgeous, I love all the different Japanese weaponry and the game is still very fun.  I will add a caveat that it plays best with 5+ players as in a four player game it's easy to quickly deduce who is on which side at which point it's all just card play.

Samurai Sword is hard to pin down. On one hand it's fun to use weapons as a "take that" mechanic, but the overall game just seems to drag. You go through the motions, hoping you're hurting the right people and then finally someone loses all their honor points and the game finally ends, but getting there can take too long due to all the back and forth of losing/gaining honor points.

Bang! rethemed in the feudal Japan: it solves the flaws from the original (like player elimination). Sadly, the base game lacks punch and the expansion is a must, but I'm guessing this wasn't a hit like its predecessor, because so far Samurai sword has received just one expansion, while Bang! has lots of them.

This is a good little game that fits well with my game group. I have never played bang so I am rating it on its own merits. I played it with five people and had a blast. Honestly, I wouldn't go below five and it would seem pointless with three, imo. I like the fact that no one is eliminated, they only lose honor, which affects scoring. They game is fast paced, easy to learn, and enjoyable. It isn't rules heavy and the scoring is limited, but it works.

Really nice looking cards and fixes most of the major issues with Bang! (player elimination, game length, card hand limits)

In addition, it adds a few more strategic layers so that even if people are confident they've figured out other people's identities, there's still room to achieve victory or further misdirect others.

Si vede l'impegno messo per cercare di superare i limiti di Bang! (non c'è più l'eliminazione dei giocatori, non è possibile colpire chi non ha più carte in mano, il Ronin/Rinnegato ha maggiori possibilità di vittoria) ma, forse anche per l'ambientazione, non ha il fascino ingenuo ed accattivante del predecessore.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (July 2013)

I dislike Bang! (I have to downgrade its rating) so I didn’t expected much from Samurai Sword. I was pleasantly surprised, this has the same core Bang! System coupled with a better theme (for me) and with no player elimination. 

I need to play more, but so far this seems to be the superior game in the Bang! series, I dislike that there is still a lot of luck in the game but the game takes under 30 minutes to play. 

As I love hidden roles games, I’m sure I will be playing this more in the future, perhaps I will buy it as it is so cheap.

Fantastica reimplementación del mítico BANG! con un arte bonito inspirado en el Japón feudal.

Nadie se quedará fuera de la partida en este juego, cosa que lastraba mucho la anterior versión. Cuando derrotamos a un rival (le quitamos el último corazón) le quitaremos ficha de honor, una vez algún jugador se quede sin honor la partida acabará, momento en el que revelaremos los roles y puntuaremos por equipos.

Party game muy recomendado!

Liking this better than my plays of bang, although still a fair amount of luck. (Bang is a decent game, still like it.)

Seems fairly luck driven though, I got a card that played extremely well with the "role" I had (using expansion, ninja that would double points and the role that would let me draw a card when I caused someone to lose the last of their health.

Seems to encourage some level of "vampiring" of honor points in a weird way.  "Well, my partner's near death. Better get that honor and score double. Oh, and draw a card. It's a good thing my buddy used all these cards to let me draw up stuff too so I have these parry cards"

This variant of Bang! is meant to solve the issues of its predecessor. No player elimination and (supposedly) shorter play time are supposed to make this a better game.

For me it doesn't.

The honour point system inevitably leads to metagaming of the worst kind: What do you do when one of your teammates is low on health? Right! You kill him! Wait, what? Yes, you kill him so that the honour point stays within your team and doesn't get into the hands of your opponents. Sure... that makes perfect thematic sense... Oh, wait! No, it doesn't!

And with everyone staying in the game the whole time... the game never speeds up to a climactic finish. No revealed identities, no dramatic twist when you realize that the deputy isn't the deputy but the renegade. The game just drags on until it's finally over and you can count the points.

Played only once at a game convention; didn't like the way it handled the (now useless) hidden role of Bang: you can begin to fight from the start since you can't be killed.

EDIT: Replayed it recently and it was different from the first play. You can bluff "killing" the Shogun even if you are a Samurai, to prevent him from losing honor to other people.

I don’t own Bang because it’s not the kind of game I prefer but I bought Samurai Sword for three reason:

3)	I needed an extra non player friendly party game for 6-7 players and here it is.
I must admit it feels good to take the Honor Point from another player.

A surprisingly entertaining game with the right group of people. It plays quickly, and with the variable roles and player powers, it offers a fair amount of replay ability. While there is some luck involved from your card draw, this can be mitigated to acceptable levels by sound strategy. Best with 5 or more. Be careful who you play with, however, the game can drag on if you have folks that are prone to AP. It's a light, quick game, and best when played as such!

Bang - Quicker, and with no player elimination. 

Samurai Sword is a new game based on the proven Bang! mechanisms and set in feudal Japan. In this game, the familiar features of Bang! are enhanced by more dynamic and fast-paced game play, and thanks to a new scoring system – based on honor points and resilience points – there is no player elimination. Everybody gets to fight to the very end! Also, weapons and attacks are fused into a single card.

Fun social deduction game similar to bang.  There are Shogun and Samurai on one side, Ninjas on another and the Ronin acts independently.  You play weapon cards to attack players and take their honor tokens.  The game ends when one player is out of honor tokens.  The game is a big improvement on Bang in that there are cards which move the game along so it does not stall.  

It can run long for what it is and not fun with AP prone players.

Cardgame ad identità nascoste.
Ogni giocatore ha una carta ruolo nascosta a seconda della quale farà punti in modo diverso facendo squadra o lavorando in solitaria.
Si fanno punti uccidendo gli avversarsi utilizzando le carte arma che vengono pescate dal mazzo comune.
Non mancano carte speciali per rubare carte, togliere equipaggiamenti, curarsi ecc..
Molto adatto ai neofiti.

A good game.

Supposedly it "fixes" Bang by taking out its player elimination aspect. However I do not consider that a mayor problem there, actually something even flavorful... speaking of which, this games I found sort of lacking in that department. 
Shogun, samurai, ninjas and the ronin all mimic well enough the sheriff, the deputies the outlaws and the renegade, but the rest (action hards, the "bangs" and so on) I didn't find as thematic...

Overall, Bang with a different skin. If player elimination in a 45 minute game is a big deal for you, go with this one. Otherwise, Bang it is.

basically Bang! 2.0 with the perma-death taken out and inherent turn timer (in that every time you go through the pack you all lose honor (first person to have 0 honour stops the game)).
Only 1 character i think is OP (basically ignores character distance) but that might be me reading the very stark description at face value. works a lot better with expansion as needs more card variety.

A great game where you have to be very strategic and where there isn't too much luck involved. You have to try and guess who your opponents are and watch their actions closely to find out who is the ally and who the enemy. The biggest drawback of the game is the amount of player you need to play it. If you don't have at least five available players, don't even consider buying it. In a three player game everybody knows who the others are and is very boring. In a four player game everyone usually finds out each other's identities after the first or second turn and then it isn't that interesting anymore as the most intriguing element of the game is to find out who everybody else is.

More or less the same as bang with a few slight differences. The main one being that no one can ever be eliminated. It does need a lot more variety of cards, but that will come with future expansions I'm sure.

I would vote to buy Bang! over this game however once it gets expansions...I'll quickly swing my vote back to this game.

I find this version of BANG! to not be as exciting as its parent game. The samurai theme is kind of awkward, and I don't know that this deviates enough from the original rules to warrant being ranked any differently. Yeah, there's no player elimination, but that just means the game goes even longer. At least in vanilla BANG! there's the excitement of seeing how the game will play out once you're eliminated. Just play BANG! Or better yet, play BANG! The Dice Game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A great team based hidden role game. The lack of player elimination is a real plus for me. There's enough tactics in just keeping yourself alive to make for an interesting game in it's own right. In fact, I've known some players to completely forget the hidden role element. Albeit, to their inevitable down-fall.

This also scales remarkably well for different player numbers. With scores being multiplied to counter uneven teams.

RATING: 6
Purports to be a streamlined version of Bang.  It does fix the lack-of-text and player elimination problems, but it produces new ones.  The "Harmless" mechanic feels very arbitrary.  Since players aren't eliminated, it's difficult to make progress in determining who's on your team.  The best strategy becomes repeatedly killing the opponent with the least amount of HP.

A much improved version of Bang! by the same guys. No more player eliminations, and a pretty cool mechanism of becoming harmless and therefore unattackable. The cards themselves are a bit repetitive, and after one play I can see replay value decreasing sharply. But I think there's way more here than in Bang!, which I think of as a novelty game, even though Bang! features a wider array of cards.

You know I like board games over video games most of the time?  Because of how much time you spend after a game talking about that game.

When you play multiplayer games you're usually moving from lobby to lobby or boss to boss without any time to reflect on some of the funny, crazy, amazing things that happened!

If you like those games that have you sit back and talk after a game, this game is for you.

In Samurai Sword you take a secret role.  There are ninjas, a ronin, and Shogun/Samurai.  These are the teams depending on how many play (at least 4 to play the real game).  The Shogun is immediately revealed, but everyone else's role is a secret.  The Samurai's job is to kill the ninjas and convince the Shogun that they are their partner.  The ninja's job is to kill the Samurai, but the ninjas don't know who one another are!  So some Ninjas just out right attack the Shogun which generally causes everyone to think they are the ninja!  Or is it just a secret ploy to get one of the ninjas off their back?!

Players will play all sorts of different cards, like weapons and armor.  There is no player elimination, but there is honor.  Once a player is knocked down to 0 health they lose an honor and give that honor to who defeated them.

Once a player has 0 honor the game ends and all roles are revealed.

The Samurai gets x2 points and one of the Ninjas also gets x2 points, so you can immediately see how important it is for the Samurai to live so he can score his team a lot of points.

So what about the ronin?  In uneven games a player becomes the ronin, a lone wolf who is out to get as much honor as possible by killing everyone, but also trying to not become a target.  The Ronin gets x2/3/4 points depending on how many players.

This game will have everyone tense till the very last moment and then let the laughter ensue.  You will talk and talk and talk about what people were thinking when they did this or that.  This is a game based solely on your choices and actions.  Can't ask for much more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The second or third times you play this game with a group are the best as they are just figuring out the bluffing tactic. The first time you play, they will be confused for the majority of it, and the fourth time onward, it will be impossible to tell which team anyone but the Shogun is on as everyone is pretending to be something they are not.

It cleans up Bang really nicely and makes for a far more entertaining and inclusive game. Plenty of effects which affect all players keeps you in the game, cards are fast to play, therefore turns are fast. I really like how the honour / VP system rewards you for staying alive, and allows players accidentally getting dead to stay in the game and gain their revenge. Yeah, it's silly and take-that, and still rather blind because you don't really know who's on whose side, but it goes fast enough to allow it to work. Impossible to get emotionally invested, so don't expect to, but if you like the genre, this is clean.

I've only played it once but I'm not a fan of this game.  Everyone's roles were revealed after about 2 rounds which made the 'secret' aspect pretty boring.  At any point you can calculate which side is going to win then the other two sides just make sure it doesn't happen.  Our game would've continued endlessly if 2 people hadn't intentionally lost just to make the game end.

By mitigating the player elimination of Bang!, this game has become somewhat dull in comparison.  My group would apparently rather knock people out than bother with hit points and armor.  I'm ambivalent.  Given the choice, I'd probably play this over Bang!, but mostly for theme reasons.

Simple, smooth, fairly fun, but I wish it grasped the theme a bit more besides just featuring Japanese stuff. Simply contains 110 cards, consider how much you think is a reasonable price to pay for paper. Have other games I'd rather play.

A better version of Bang! No player elimination! The honor and resilience mechanics put a fresh twist on the attack your neighbor schtick. One of the most interesting mechanics is the "penalty" of becoming "helpless" once you run out of resilience or cards. The neat part is when players use it in a tactical way to snatch away honor and immediately protect themselves against attacks.

One thing I had hoped Samurai Sword would fix is the length of Bang! when played with a large group. I think there's more potential for team strategy and with the right plan the game could end fairly fast, but there's always the potential for the game to go on with nobody losing their last honor point.

Overall: I nice diversion from Bang! They're definitely on the right track and if Samurai Sword gets the kind of expansion support that Bang! did it could really turn into a solid game.

RATING: 6
Streamlined version of Bang. The best and most prominent improvement is that you steal a victory point, if you kill someone, instead of eliminating the player. This can lead to nice tactical situation, when you kill your team mate to prevent the other team from getting the VP or end the game (the VP stays in your team anyway).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The tactical play is very nice and there is much more game in this than in Bang!. 4-5-player game seems to be optimal. 6-player-game starts to drag already and heavily favors the Ninjas. 7-8-player-game is a drag fest and only suggested as a social thing to pass time. A bit too long with new players and the pace is too slow.  

Final edit. Takes too long compared what it actually offers, basically a "take that"-card game. The hidden role aspect isn't very deep so it is pretty much about hitting each for the rest of the game until it ends.

A spiritual successor to Bang, which makes it a better game in that the cardplay is more streamlined and the renegade stands a better chance to win, but the cards are boiled down to simple numbers typically and some of the character powers are replicated in the draw deck, making them feel much less special.

A Bang! system game with a feudal Japan setting.  Longer than Bang! the Dice Game, with no player elimination and more indirect warfare.  The factions (Shogun and Samurai, Ninja, and Ronin) compete for honor that can be gained or lost in various ways.  Because of the possibility of indirect warfare it can be harder to draw out the Ronin - who gets bonus honor at game end, a distinct upgrade from his Bang! counterpart, the Renegade (who can be hard to play as).

RATING: 5.7
I appreciate that it sells well, but beyond this, I can't see why anyone would base a game on the Bang! 'system'.

So, to address the major flaw of Bang! - player elimination. Now, instead of being eliminated, you lose an honour token which goes to the person who killed you and then on your next turn, you refresh with health and go again. The game ends when someone runs out of honour tokens.

Potentially, this means that you could go on forever, with teams just trading honour back and forth with no resolution. I sincerely hope that there's something in the rules that addresses this. (Update: there is!)

In our game, the Ronin (the one without a team) tricked one person in to thinking he was on their team and so all 4 players ganged up on that one person (armour had a role to play in this too). Thankfully, it ended the game quickly, but it didn't seem to be any fun for that person at all.

Is it better than Bang? Yes, but not by a million miles and I'd still rather play any of a number of games instead.

Wow, what an improvement over Bang. I still prefer The Resistance: Avalon for a similar type of game, but Samurai Sword is actually playable compared to Bang.

I'm a sucker for good Japanese themes, and I really enjoyed Bang!, so a tweaked system and re-theme made me very happy. This game is a lot of fun and solves the players going out way too quickly and easily problem, and the weighted scoring makes being stuck as the Ronin (Renegade) a lot easier to play and win. There are rule variants that will let you play with just 3, but it's really the most fun when you can get a good 6 or 7 players in.

This game is a lot like Bang! but with the added benefit that there's no player elimination. I only played it once and it was hard to get a grip on strategy since that part of it is a little bit different than Bang! but it seemed interesting.

Great card game. Fast paced, and encourages some team play. We made up a house rule that everyone can parry everyone else's attack, including attacks on allies, and this made the game even better. Unlike other BANG! variants, in this game no player gets eliminated, which is a plus. Highly recommended.

I love the flavor of this more than of the original Bang, plus the game-ending mechanics are smother and unlike Bang no players are kicked out and get to watch the rest battle it out.

Not sure if I like this better than Bang! Probably requires a few more plays to decide. Things I like more than Bang! : 1) No player elimination; 2) Integration of distance and Bang! cards with weapon cards; 3) Art work and theme. Now, things I really don't like about this version: 1) No player elimination. Death of player character is not thematic and being harmless after death just is not terribly believable. At least should swap out for new character and lose an entire hand of cards. 2) Being a ninja aka outlaw becomes really tedious. Death of shogun aka sheriff does not signal automatic victory. Thus, it is tougher to win as a Ninja since watching out for the ronin (renegade) is also important.In some ways, the strategy is more straightfoward in Bang! As an outlaw, all you care about is killing the Sheriff. No need to worry about the deputies or even the renegade because if the Sheriff dies, you win. Now, killing the Shogun in this game means little since you can still lose to the Shogun+Samurai total score or the ronin. Probably requires more plays to decide if this better than Bang! Right now, I actually prefer Bang!.

Re-theming Bang! with few new twists. It is still very much like bang, although the theme does not work quite that well in my opinion.

Rising Sun expansion makes the game more interesting but isn't necessary.  Play the base game till you want more.

RATING: 7
Better than Bang! because there is no player elimination and the game ends inevitably, preenting a long drawn game often seen in Bang!. However since there is no player elimination it becomes more about hoarding points for yourself without caring who your team members are instead of targeting the shogun and his samurais and vice versa.

Big fan of Bang! This is a rethemed version of Bang!, with some changes. The changes include the addition of honour tokens (sort of victory tokens), that players can 'steal' from eachother. Once 1 player does not have any honour tokens anymore, the game ends. So there's no player elimination anymore.
I like the fact that there's no player elimination, but the theme didn't work for me. I also thought there was little variety in the cards. Samurai Sword felt soulless and bland, and I much prefer to play Bang! over this.

It's been awhile since I played Bang, so hard to compare the two for me right now.  This was fun, the secret role deal is amusing.  Would like to play it again a couple of times to see if it has legs.

Always a hit with 4+ players. My friends who have played BANG! like this better. The Italian part of the cards is strangely the main font but it's fun to yell "PARATA!" when you parry.

To me a much better and 'cleaned up' version of the game "Bang!". While "Bang!" nearly always end up being very personal and tuff throughout the play elimination, "Samurai Sword" maintain a certain level of 'honour' that goes well with the flavour of the game.

I am not a big fan of bang lately but i must say Emiliano Sciarra managed to breath some new air into the game. The honour points and life points system really improves the game and makes it much more strategic. also the distance concept is now simpler. art is still very good and the number of weapons is great. consider to try it both if u liked or disliked bang.

My only play was interrupted permanently, and I didn't mind one bit.  At least there's no player elimination, like in Bang.

But dammit, there's no player elimination, like in Bang.  So you can't go do something else instead.

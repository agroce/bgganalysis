Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Nothing new here, but it puts the Japanese design stamp on a Carc + Puerto Rico game.  Plays quickly, but offers lots of choices.  There seems to be a good amount of paths to victory, as I really did not focus on buildings, but was able to win.  This is one I really want to explore more.  Really neat one.

RATING: 7
Rating is for a filler.
20 minute mash-up of Puerto Rico, Carcassonne and Walnut Grove.

Because the game is so short, a lucky random tile draw can really hand you the game...but who cares if the game is over in 20 minutes.

What a terrific little game. An amalgam of Carcassonne and Puerto Rico with enough oomph to be enjoyed by seasoned gamers. Quite positively surprised. Plays quickly and looks naively awesome too. Love it.

RATING: 6
The concept is neat and core systems are elegantly woven together, but the luck of the tile draw seems unpleasantly high. You can mitigate it to some degree with buildings, but in each of our games about half the players didn't have much fun because they simply couldn't draw into good board-fit, and everything else hinges on that.

One friend expressed the sentiment "this feels like it's a  late-stage prototype - a few development cycles away from being a phenomenal game, but not quite done yet". I lean towards agreeing?

My feeling is, if you're not going to be any way innovative, then you should at least be really good at merging all the mechanisms you've taken from other games.  But this effort just left me wanting -- wanting more options, wanting back-up plans, wanting more control.  Bleh.  I'd rather play Welcome to Walnut Grove, the game this seems to be most lifted from.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Take a big bunch of Carcasonne, add in some resource generation, a little building purchasing, and some action selection from Puerto Rico and you have The King of Fronteir.

And it manages to throw all of this together in a quick 30 minute filler time.  It all feels familiar, in a good way, and with enough going on to keep things moving swiftly.  
The need for particular landscape configurations is greater than in Carcassonne and as such you are somewhat at the mercy of the random tile draw, but really I am picking faults where none are due.  

Letâ€™s hope that this gets picked up by a European or American company and gets wider distribution, it deserves it.

A clever mash-up of Puerto Rico and Carcassonne, with some Walnut Grove thrown in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game gathers pretty much all my favorite things in one place: Tile laying, role selection with off-turn benefits, and produce/consume cycles.  The buildings add a large amount of variety to the game.  Lowered to a 7 because it seems like the end game often drags as people try to find tiles that fit their remaining spots.

I think the rules should state that the winner must stand and proclaim "I AM KING OF FRONTIER"

RATING: 6
King of Frontier is a charmingly honest mash-up of Carcassonne and Puerto Rico that plays in about 30 minutes. It is easy to get lucky or unlucky with the tile draws, and completing features (or failing to do so) can result in huge swings of fortune but as the end speedily approaches you can already plot for the rematch.

Carcassonne mixed with Puerto Rico. Liked the scoring and how you could buy specific tiles or draw to try your luck. Smooth filler game that's not just an activity.

RATING: 8
Lovely cross between Carcassone and Puerto Rico.  Easy to teach, plays fast, player mats are a little light, but thick robust bright tiles.  Some luck of the tile draw, but you can play several games a session.  Worth getting the more building expansion too.

RATING: 5
Mashing up a mechanic I love (Carcassonne tile-laying) with one I kind of hate (role selection) to produce something I have lukewarm feelings about. Which means, good job capturing the essence of both genres, I guess.

RATING: 7.5
King of Frontier is a game I had been seeing too many gamers with great taste enjoying, and had on my 'grab ASAP' list; kudos to BGG for making that possible!

It proves to be a quick playing mix of Walnut Grove, Puerto Rico and Carcassonne, with material limits that keep things moving along; basically a mix of Walnut Grove and the 18-card microgame concept, with role selection and tile laying on individual maps.

It's an addictive little game, the 'just one more' variety that threatens to be far more than just a quick filler, though it can certainly be that too.

The King of Frontier is an immediately appealing game, and a wonderful add to the collection.

Raised to 7.5 on (112715).

RATING: 7
Surprisingly successful mix of Carcassonne with Puerto Rico and a dash of Rosenberg harvesting. Each turn, the active player chooses one of four actions: getting new tiles, buying a special building, producing or consuming. His action is stronger, the other players can follow his action in a weaker version.

There's not too much depth, luck plays a significant role but for a thirty minute filler King of Frontier packs quite some punch. The Japanese artwork is another plus for getting it on the table again.

Quick playing tile-laying game with similarities to Carcassonne except tiles are placed within a proscribed area on individual player boards.  Game play is okay but nothing special.  Artwork is bad; production and graphic quality is poor.  Would play again but don't want it in my collection.

Quite Good.  Needs an English version.  Vaguely a mix of Carcassonne and Puerto Rico.

RATING: 7
This is a light but interesting blend of Carc and Puerto Rico where each person in turn takes an action with a benefit and everyone else takes the same action sans benefit.  Tiles are put together forming different fields, quarries, forest or cities and can produce or consume goods.  Great little filler.

A mash up between Carcasonne and Puerto Rico that plays in 30 minutes or less. Huge random factor over tile selection drives your possible actions, so no deep strategy here.

RATING: 7
Lovely little game in the same vein as Carcassonne or Walnut Grove with some role/action selection Ã¡ la Puerto Rico. The 4x5 grid is tiiight and you really need to plan well in order to get all the spaces filled. It's not a puzzly as Walnut Grove so i'd guess this would work better with non-gamers.

Also you can easily play this in 15 minutes with two players so I can't recommend this high enough.

A Puerto Rico-meets-Castle engine-building game, only available in Japanese. Worth playing and almost worth getting excited about, were it not for the ridiculous runaway leader problem, which is all driven by lucky tile draw.

[b]The King of Frontier[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I hadn't heard of The King of Frontier before I sat down to play, but the sales pitch of Carcassonne meets Puerto Rico was enough to get me to the table. It turns out that is a great description, you are laying tiles to build a city in a confined grid using role selection to choose your action for each round. Points will be scored based on special buildings you buy, how much of your board you're able to fill [i](empty spaces score negative VP)[/i] and taking an action to turn your wheat into VP [i](in essence your feeding the people in your cities)[/i]. 

The random element of the tile draw can definitely give you an advantage early, especially the initial tile draw. If you can quickly close off areas and produce goods you'll be able to get your engine running quicker than other players. This is a minor nitpick of mine, but I could see it being frustrating for some players as they continue to draw tiles in hope of closing off areas on their board while you're able to produce goods. Game play is quick, we played two 4p games in an hour. For such a short game it packs quite a punch; there seem to be multiple paths to victory that can be explored especially since there are a variety of special buildings that allow you to score VP for fulfilling certain conditions. I will note that The King of Frontier is a punishing game, it is easy to do poorly especially when you're learning the game.

I really enjoyed my plays of The King of Frontier, but this was a Japanese release from 2013 and is now OOP and expensive. I would get a copy if it ever got re-released, especially if it got a component upgrade and new artwork. Definitely one I'd recommend playing if you get the chance, it is impressive how much game is packed into a 1/2 hour play experience.[/i]

A very clever mash-up of tiling and role selection that needs another overhaul and development before it is ready for release.  Randomness on tile draws (at the start of the game and throughout the game) is huge and frustrating.  But the way buildings have both a cost and a topology is brilliant, and there is some really huge (untapped) potential in the ideas the game explores.  It is very rough as a finished product, but shows a lot of promise as a work in progress.

I've been chasing this game for a while and finally got a copy through trade. Can't wait to play.

This game came out of nowhere and I gotta say that am very impressed. There's a lot of game in this little box. It uses the PR role selection in the form of actions so there's never any downtime, which is great. The gameplay is delicious, fast and filled with strategic choices. Only half of the 16 buildings are used in the 2p game so there's a lot of replay value out of the box. But I must have the expansion to spice things up, cause we'll be playing this for a while.

The game feels like an early prototype that hasn't been developed. The idea is cool but the dynamics just aren't in balance and the story arc of the game felt all screwed up.

RATING: 6
Played once with 4P. In the same vein of games like [thing=159470][/thing], The King of Frontier merges familiar mechanisms from popular games. This time, it combines the tile-laying from Carcassonne with the role selection from Puerto Rico. Players attempt to complete features on their personal maps, produce resources using those complete features and convert resources into points. 

The decision-making required isn't novel â€“ figure how to orient your tiles, and pick actions which would benefit you without benefiting your opponents too much â€“ but the overall result is still a quick and decent challenge nonetheless. The only issue I have is that the game can move at a frenetic pace. When combined with the luck of draw, this scuttles any long-term strategy and prioritises grabbing points whenever possible.

a sonic speed mash-up of Puerto Rico and Carcassonne

a terrific, delightful little game. it feels familiar and yet fresh at the same time. the length of the game is perfect. i hope this gets wider distribution.

a little more interaction would be nice but otherwise excellent.

Fast carc. / Puerto Rico mash up. The special buildings add a certain amount of complexity ( and neck craning to see them). The PR action selection works very well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cute filler that's a sort of cross between Carcassonne and Puerto Rico: each player chooses one of four actions on their turn, with other players getting a slightly worse version. Either draw 2 tiles (other players: 1) and place them on their grid, produce goods in 2 (1) completed regions, build a building at a discount (or full price), or consume wheat in a completed city for 1+X VP (0+X).

Players lose points for empty spaces at game end and get a huge bonus for filling all spaces; buildings provide VP and various unique bonuses. 

There's quite a lot of luck in the tile draws but it plays very fast and different strategies all seem viable. While in theory it's good that not all buildings are available in the 2p game, I'm not sure it's balanced (e.g., consumption is much stronger/weaker depending on whether the markets are in the game). The same applies to the More Buildings expansion, but I really like the significantly different scoring opportunities there so will probably never play without it again.

There's so much luck that I don't understand why I enjoy this as much as I do, but every time it comes out it gets played at least twice. A great little filler.

RATING: 7
A very simple tile laying race game which is charming and enjoyable. 

I think the biggest problem is that there doesn't seem to be much of an arc to the game (with 2p) or at the very least it is a short one. Player actions don't provide substantial bonuses over the other players so any effect tends to be subtle. Whether it is because of this or despite it the game seems to be fairly well balanced even with the random mix of buildings, some of which are vastly more flexible and powerful than others.

If I can find a copy I'll consider picking it up.

RATING: 9
This thing is addicting like a great snack. You finish it quickly, and then you're plotting when to grab it again. If you enjoy tile laying games, this one is particularly good. Many ways to play, but most games are over in less than 30 minutes. Every time I play, I'm ready to go again. Variable strategies are often needed in a game, as it all depends on tiles, and other players' actions, and how much time is left. I love it.

Preliminary rating (based on one play) is 8/8.5. This is an excellent twenty-minute game that combines Carcassonne with Puerto Rico. We prefer it to both standard Carcassonne, Hunters & Gatherers and South Seas.

Very streamlined and fun. Rating could rise with repeat plays.

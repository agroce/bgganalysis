LIKE: Clever twists to a couple of mechanisms makes this game stand out. Played very well at 3 players. I really like the end-game cards and seeing who has what for the final score.

DISLIKE: Dry as can be, but I love it! I could also see this wearing out after many plays.

OVERALL: Good, good stuff-- as long as you are into Euros.

Grabbed a copy from Essen SPIEL17 with the wooden component free upgrade, thanks it's so charming with the upgrade.

Played a few time, it's not a hard game and it's tight in a way. The artwork has similarity with Gentes. I personally prefer this over Gentes. The WP system has very unique way to play and full of interaction.

Definitely would love to play again anytime!

Abstract:
Calimala is about the guild of cloth finishers and merchants in Florence. It is an economic game with emphasis on efficiency (piggy-backing), area-control, and the race for different scoring tiles which are activated one by one in a sequential order. 
Calimala has an innovative action selection system: each turn, the active player places one of his discs on a still empty action space or stacks it on top of existing discs. All players, who have discs at that space, can activate the two related actions (from the adjacent action tiles). If a 4th disc is placed on top of a stack, the next scoring tile is evaluated and the disc at the bottom of the stack goes into the city council (used for tie-breaker). The game ends when players have spent all their discs or all scoring tiles have been activated.

Action overview:
a) Collect wood
b) Collect brick
c) Collect marble 
d) Build a workshop, a ship, or a trade house by spending wood or bricks
e) Artwork: spend a marble and place it on a free space of one of the four buildings
f) Weave: place a cloth in each workshop
g) Ship: for each ship place a cloth from the workshops to any port city
h) Transport: place a cloth to each trade city with a trade house
i) Contribute: spend wood, brick, or marble to one of the three cathedrals buildings
Note: players collect resources by placing them on a free space in the corresponding warehouse on their player board

Pros:
+ Innovative action selection by stacking discs
+ Race for every one of the 15 scoring tiles is tense
+ High variability: the 8 action tiles and 15 scoring tiles are randomly distributed which gives each game a very different feel
+ High, indirect player interaction: action selection may trigger scoring as well as actions for other players (piggy-backing)
+ Escalates over time since stacks grow over time
+ Elegant integration of area-control: multi-used cubes for different buildings/cities plus different resources, and city council as tie-breaker
+ Everyone is scoring the personal endgame objectives: players have to find out the personal objectives of the other players during the game
+ Compensation (bonus card) if a player is unable to execute an action
+ Quick game: quick turns, actions can be executed simultaneously most of the time
+ Quick game set-up
+ Plays well with all player counts (more unpredictable with higher player counts)
+ Well written rules (many examples, the font is a little tiny though)
+ Good aid on each player board
+ Easy to teach (except for the tie-breaker)

Neutrals:
# Theme is okay (dry, quite abstract)
# Artwork is very clean (50 shades of brown - I like it)
# Solid game components and game box
# Some luck: players randomly draw bonus cards 
# No hidden information (except for bonus cards and personal endgame objectives)
# A strategic game: all scoring tiles are revealed from the beginning ...
# ... with some chaos: the action selection of each player is hard to predict but has a big impact on everyone else
# Some engine building (workshops, transport, and ships)
# Tie-breaker is quite complicated, but it is important for decision-making and adds another layer to the action selection
# Except for the personal objectives, all components are used each game, there are no new elements from game to game

Cons:
- Randomly drawn bonus cards are sometimes a bit luck-prone (should even out over the course of the game)

Thoughts:
Calimala is an elegant game. The integration of area-control, multi-used cubes as resources, and city council as tie-breaker is very well done. What I like most is the tense race for the scoring tiles! I also like that each game plays very differently depending on the random layout of the scoring and action tiles. There is very little down-time, most turns are very quick and other players may do actions as well and mostly simultaneously.
The action selection by stacking discs is cool and innovative. It can be a bit chaotic and unpredictable, but it is not that bad and ensures quick games without much analysis paralysis. Each turn, I pray that someone activates a particular action or I pray that someone does NOT activate a particular action...

Good first impression.  A lot to think about and chew on over the 90 minute time-frame.  A bit boring to look at but the game play with it's stacking actions and multiple area control arenas make up for the fact that you are sending cloth to places.

A nice mix of tactics and planning and an unusual Euro-style game that seems to reward doing what everyone else is rather than the opposite.

First play: One of the better area majority games although turn order in the early game needs to be given proper consideration if you are a tail ender. Start players will scoop the early points very cheaply and have the opportunity to snipe points from later scoring tiles as well. I'm not sure if the chance to pick and early action card is sufficient compensation.

Intresting mechanics but the game is very repetitive and full of micro calculations. I wished the board would develop more based on player actions.

The system of selecting actions is the real highlight here, as I haven't seen anything else like it. On your turn, you place one of your discs on an action space, which activates the two adjacent actions. Furthermore, it also allows all the discs already placed there to also take those actions. So, you're always balancing getting things for yourself vs. allowing other players to do stuff if they already have discs there.

The grid of these actions is randomly seeded, which means from game to game, different actions will be adjacent to each other to take as an action pair than in other games.

The scoring system is also kind of neat, in that there are 15 area majorities that will score, but the order is random from game to game. So, things you need to rush to do, and things that score later, will always be different.

However, these cool things are put into a game where the goals, and what you can do, are kind of blah. Everything you're shooting for is very vanilla area majority scoring. There's a little engine building in the game, but the engines are capped, so once you max them out, you kind of auto-pilot them from there, taking away some interest.

Overall, I wish the things you were doing in the game were as interesting as the mechanisms that are present. Still a game I'd play if others wanted to, though.

I was excited to play this since I have heard good things about it but I think I over-hyped myself on it. I like the unique worker placement of placing your discs on top of each other to activate 2 adjacent actions and then those discs reactivate every time someone else places a disc on top. It makes for a highly interactive game. Once the 4th disc is in a stack, a scoring takes place. Calimala has some great ideas, and the variability each game with the actions and scorings is a great touch. However, the game falls apart for me in that there is a random card draw when you can't take an action that gives you bonus actions that can be played at any later time sometimes multiple cards per turn. Because this is a pure top deck draw it can really be feast or famine if you get bonus actions that are helpful, and it seems that random draw drives the winner instead of smart play with the actions and scoring.

RATING: 7
Not at all an engine builder as it appeared. A majorities game where everything counts toward two majorities and every majority is scored in a order designated at the beginning of the game. Then there is another scoring of secret majorities that were chosen and hidden at the beginning. The engine of the game is a worker placement mechanism that gives you two activations per turn. The two tokens under yours will also then activate. If there is a third underneath, it squirts out and causes the next majority in order to score. Whosever's token it is that squirted will now count toward the tie-break, which is pretty critical through the game.

Overall, the game is about timing and spreading your effort, just not too thin. The game has a nice ebb and flow. I don't know what kind of legs it has, but my first play was enjoyable. There is a lot of nuance to explore with the action selection mechanism and the effects on turn order and passive repeat actions.

Update: Bumped up to 8 on 2d play.
Nice little spin on worker placement. Actions are randomized on a grid, and you place your discs on spaces [i]between[/i] the actions, which gives you two actions on your turn (the two actions your disc is between). There are lots of things that score, and the order is randomized. Actions discs can be stacked, in which case when you take an action, not just the active player, but everyone in the stack gets the two actions. There are a [i]lot[/i] of scoring opportunities, so you can look ahead and decide which ones you're going to make a play for, and which you wont'. House rule: When playing with random placement of action spaces, don't let wood and brick be next to each other. It's just too obvious of a first move, which creates a pile-on, which makes starting player too advantageous.

Calimala is an area majority game featuring an interesting dual action selection. Players stack their workers between action spots to pick up and deliver different goods to several areas or to draw random cards granting extra actions, and every time new workers are stacked the owners of workers underneath get to perform those actions again. Accordingly, the game starts quite slowly but eventually evolves into a frenzy of consecutive actions and scoring phases in different areas, which requieres clever planning.

Unfortunately, a few issues became apparent in our first play. The action efficiency of delivering to port cities is obviously greater, first player seems to have a noticeable advantage in terms of getting more actions and winning ties, and luck-of-the-draw concerning extra action cards can be quite decisive. I'm not really sure whether the game is properly balanced.

I helped playtest it. Fabio has done wonderful work in creating a tapestry of choices; a network of options. After many plays, there is no obvious path to victory but instead it is possible to either focus on one of a few areas, or to simply grab a little of everything.

I have no doubt that in its finished form, it will remain engrossing for tens of plays.

Feels like you're never in control and always reacting to the next scoring or the state of the action selection spaces in order to get more done. The rules are really simple for a game with a lot to think about and the randomness of the cards only serves to remind you that you really need to try and control your own destiny by making sure you can perform actions when they come up. A big part of the game is trying to read other players actions and figure out what scoring cards will be revealed at the end of the game. Doing that successfully can make it so you are a contender vs lagging behind. Very quick for the amount of things that you need to think about.

Innovative and clever area-majority scoring game.

Calimala is a terrific area majority game.  I'm not a big fan of area majority games, particularly the take-that swingy nature of them.  I respect El Grande a great deal, but you can be devastated by the negative attacking actions of others.  Calimala gets around this with its very clever mechanism which means all actions are positive.  In fact taking the action you want will often trigger another player also getting the action. The way this all works is just so very clever, I cannot think of another word for it.  

Such a clever clever game. And it definitely plays best with 4 or 5.

RATING: 5
Calimala is an area majority game with an interesting worker placement mechanism. There is a 3x3 grid of actions. These actions can allow you to make cubes, place cubes, and increase your efficiency at making/placing. People will take turns placing their worker between two actions and trying to perform both. If you can't do an action (ie full capacity), you will get a random action card to be used later. Additionally, if there are players that have previously been between the two actions you've chosen, these players will also get to do these actions. After so many people have gone to a spot, this will trigger one of the many area majority spots. Also, players have a secret area majority end game scoring card that will trigger regardless of whether they have majority or not. The way the action tiles and order of the areas that are scored, help increase the variability of the game.

There has never been a time where the disparity between, how I thought the game would play based on the rules and how our actual game played, was so large. [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1897922/nature-play-rules-and-goodbad-strategy-questions]In fact, I wrote a lengthy post in the forums about it.[/url] Feel free to read, but it might not make sense, if you haven't played the game before. Suffice it to say, I didn't really enjoy my play. Could coming in last place, have affected my opinion? Yes. Could the disparity that I mentioned earlier also affected my opinion? Yes. I'm also not a good judge based on the weird play and single play of the game. What I can say, is that there are other area control/majority games that I prefer and think I would prefer, even if the game played out how I thought it would. As well, I feel like the scoring would be tighter than I would like and it was a little annoying remembering who's turn it was among a stack of actions at times, due to allowing card plays (which mimic actions on the grid) before/after an action. It was definitely disappointing.

This game was much more different than I expected. I thought it'd be a rather relaxed, medium-weight euro, but instead it's the kind of game "knife fight in a phone" booth was coined for. 

You're placing discs to trigger actions between two action tiles (randomly set up each game). When someone places a disc on top of yours, your disc re-triggers and you get to take the action again. 

The fourth disc on a stack will trigger a scoring which is where the knife fighting comes into play. There are 21(?) different scorings during the game (also set up randomly each game). Someone will take an action that triggers the next category to be scored. They might do this because it will score them points or because they want to trigger the scoring before someone in particular/anyone has a chance to improve their position. Many groans will be induced. 

You need to assess the board each turn as there frequently was a one best move to either prepare for the next inevitable scoring or to cut off other players at the knees. Very clever game and I look forward to another play, but I have to be in the mood for this type of knife-edge, no room for error game.

I really did not like this game.  It dragged as people thought about their moves.  The many card draws lead people to draw a card, look at it, think about what to do, then maybe draw another card, look at it, and so on.  It was not engaging to me at all; the theme doesn't come through and there's little attraction to the interaction.

Board changes with each game so more interest in replay.  Very competitive yet impossible not to help others.  The game speeds up dramatically near the end.  
     An interesting mechanic of placing a token always gets two actions of which at least one has to be performed, but the inability to perform the 2nd action gains the player a beneficial card--the only way to obtain these helpful cards.  Player tokens on the same spot give those players a replay of the actions, and if a 4th token is displaced, scoring is triggered.  
     Unlike many heavy Euros, once this med-light game is explained there is no repeated reference to the rules, or icons that have to be memorized, or cards looked up to understand.  Definitely there is strategy & 2nd guessing your opponents.

RATING: 6
The action selection mechanism is quite clever but the designer did not really manage to create a compelling game around it as the actions you can select from are all fairly bland. In addition, there seems to be a notable start player advantage. Scorings are often very tactical and short-sighted affairs, and there is very little information to go on regarding the categories scored again at the end of the game. It feels very swingy this way.

CALIMALA, Gewinner des Hippodice Autorenwettbewerbs 2016. Das erwähne ich deshalb, weil das Autorenhafte in diesem eigenständigen Werk gut zu sehen ist. Will meinen: das Spiel ist nicht so furchtbar glatt gebügelt, hat dafür aber eben auch ein paar kleine Eckigkeiten wie beispielsweise einen spürbaren Startspieler- und Reihenfolgenvorteil. Der zentrale Aktionsmechanismus ist durchaus kreativ und interpretiert Holzscheibeneinsatz neu. CALIMALA ist im Wesentlichen ein Mehrheiten- und Wertungsspiel, das die bekannten Genre-Elemente neu und interessant zusammensetzt. Es lebt davon, dass im Grunde fast jede Runde eine der 15 Wertungen ausgelöst werden kann. Und das passt einem eigentlich nie richtig in den Kram, weil man überall permanent zu knapp dasteht, um entscheidend zu punkten. Man will Wertungen verhindern. Andere Wertungen würde man am liebsten gerne forcieren, aber die stehen noch nicht an. Man will auf allen Hochzeiten mittanzen, was aber einfach nicht geht. Dann wiederum löst man einfach Wertungen aus, um andere abzugrätschen. Im Verlauf des Spiel wird es immer kniffliger, zu welchen Aktionsfeldern wohin man seine Scheibe setzen soll, weil man dabei schon wieder eine Wertung auslöst, die man gerade nicht will. CALIMALA ist verklemmt, kopfzerbrechend, nervös, interaktiv, ärgerlich, tut weh und fördert einen seltsamen Ehrgeiz zutage. Das Würfelgetummel auf dem Brett ist fummelig. Das Thema Tuchhändler in Florenz ist aus der Mottenkiste vom Dachboden. Das typisch hölzerne Artwork von Harald Lieske ist hier wirklich passgenau und holt das Erlebnis atmosphärisch gut ab. Das Upgrade Kit aus Pressholz mit den Plastikschablonen aus dem Bauzeichnerbüro addiert dem indiemässigen Teil noch etwas Flair hinzu. CALIMALA ist ein typisches Liebhaberspiel von ähnlichem Hakennasen-Charakter und mit abstehenden Ohren wie KINGS WILL. Man könnte es im Kontext der Ökonomisierung des Brettspielmarkts sogar als Anachronismus bezeichnen. Das gefällt mir.

Components: excellent ones
Complex: easy to learn and to teach
Weight: medium
Players: works well with 3 and 4
Length: around 60 mins
Mechanics: workers placement, area control
Decisions: could seem not to have many due to the scoring system, but you have a lot
Opinion: this is one of those games where you say...you have a lot with a very short time of play. And that's true, games use to last around 60 mins (3 and 4 players).
Here you take the role of a Cloth Finisher, at least in theory, because, yes, this is an euro in all of its terms (and this is not bad).
During several turns you will be placing your workers trying to do several actions in order to get the area control on many different places. But the worker placement mechanic is not the standard one.
When you place a worker you can do 2 actions (at least must do one of them), but...you also activate all those workers already placed on that space, being your or not, and this is one thing I love here. You have to take care or look what do you need and who is there, because they will be activated after you.
Must say that this doesn't happen always, as soon as there are 4 workers on a space, and here comes another thing I love, the last worker is placed on the Council, activating one of the scorings, and you have 15 of these.
Must also say that, in order to compensate when you cannot do an action, you receive a card, representing one of the actions that you could use later.
In a nutshell, you have to take care where you place your workers, and the order the scoring will happen (this changes from game to game). Very dynamic game, tough decisions and short length

It looks like and tries to be a strategy game, but it's not. You don't control much in this game, it's more like total chaos. Sometimes you can't even do something for the next few scoring rounds, as other players may activate the next 2-3 scoring rounds before it's your turn again...

There's just nothing interesting in this game to me.

This game has a very interesting worker placement mechanism which I've never seen before. On top of performing your actions during your turn. your workers acts as "out of turn free actions" as well as a scoring indicator. At its heart, its also an area control game. The tempo of the game is determine by the players if they want to aggressively push for a fast or slow game. I like it for its simplicity and depth but I think the card draws add a bit of an unnecessary luck element into the game.

Player actions and majority scorings alternate minute-by-minute in Calimala. If you don't think ahead a few scorings, your preparations for powerful turns come too late while others have scored in the mean time with minimal effort. Each turn, a player chooses one action spot that triggers two different actions. Player interaction comes by the innovative disc stacking mechanism. Previously placed discs remain on the action spots and the owners can execute actions again when other Discs are placed subsequently. Only the fourth disc on a spot removes the lowermost disc and triggers a scoring.

Calimala is a mix between tactical short-term scoring and long-term preparations. Replayability is achieved by random combinations of actions and the order of the scorings. Two potential drawbacks are the limited tech trees and the advantage for Players earlier in the turn order that is not compensated. At least if the game was explained correctly to us which I'm not so sure as we got two different explanations for the tie-breaker in scorings. One of the more interesting releases of Spiel 2017 although of limited general Appeal with the strong focus on majority scoring.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed this one - thought the action disk system where the fourth disk causes a scoring to occur to be quite clever. Uncertain if there are certain combinations that should never be in play on the action board if you go with a random setup - some would feel stronger than others. I was also frustrated at times when cards drawn were not very helpful and there was no way to turn in 2-3 of them to take a wild action. Game is both tactical and strategic in nature but each scoring is the same so you can plan ahead and go for later scoring or hit it hard in the present (or try both!).

house rule when playing with random placement of action spaces: Don't let wood and brick be next to each other. It's just too obvious of a first move, which creates a pile-on, which makes starting player too advantageous

2 players variant:
The idea is that each player will place discs in their color, in white or in a third, neutral, color.
Discs in the neutral color behave differently and their presence in a stack triggers the automatic placement of cubes in that color wherever the players place cubes in their color

The overall game play is the same as with other player counts, with the following differences:

SETUP
Each player takes 
- 12 discs in their color, 
- 4 white discs 
- 6 discs in a third 'neutral' color.

The 'neutral' cubes are placed somewhere reachable by both players (no other components in the neutral color are required).

Scoring cards:
Deal 4 scoring cards to each player, put one of the remaining two face down next to the board and place the last one back in the box (unrevealed).
Each player looks at their four cards, picks one to keep secret, one to reveal face up next to the board and places the other two back in the box (unrevealed).
At this point each player has one secred scoring card, and there are two face up and one face down scoring cards next to the board: at the end of the game these five cards will be scored and each player knows three of them during the game.

GAME PLAY
Own discs and white discs behave as normally, neutral discs behave according to the following rules:

1. A 'neutral' disc can be placed only on a stack that doesn't have already a neutral disc.

2. When a 'neutral' disc is placed, other discs in the stack are not activated. The player that places the disc takes the actions normally (one action per side, plus any additional cards). 

3. 'Neutral' discs are not activated 'directly' when other discs are placed on top of them.

4. For each active disc in a stack that contains a 'neutral' disc`, whenever the controlling player places one or more of their own cubes on the main board, one cube in the neutral color is added to the same space (if possible).

Scoring and tie breakers work as with a three players game, neutral discs can have seats on the council and neutral cubes count for majorities (You can optionally keep the score for the neutral color using the 13th disc on the scoring track).

Rules clarifications
Rule 1.
- A neutral disc can not be added to a three discs stack with a neutral disc at the bottom (i.e. the neutral disc at the bottom still counts even if it's going to be kicked out after the discs above it will be activated),
- There are exactly 12 spaces on the board where to place discs and 12 neutral discs. In the unlikely case where the only disc left to a player is 'neutral' and all the other 11 discs are on the board, that player won't have any choice than placing their last disc on the only stack left without a neutral disc. In that case it might be possible for that player to take two action cards if they can't perform neither action. But normally, if two or more places are available, that player must pick an action space where at least one action can be performed, if possible.

Rule 4.
- When a player performs actions because of a disc on a stack with a neutral disc, it doesn't matter which actions are performed (either directly from the disc, or through cards played while that disc was activated) but for every place where the player places one or more cubes, one extra neutral cube is added.
- This applies also when a neutral disc is placed: the player that placed the disc takes the actions, and then for every set of cubes placed anywhere on the board a neutral cube is added to the same place.
- This applies also when a fourth disc is added to a stack where the neutral disc was at the bottom: the neutral cubes are placed accordingly and only after the top three discs are activated the neutral disc moves to the city council.

whenever you place one or more cubes somewhere, and the current stack has a neutral disc, you also place a neutral cube in the same place (if there is room for it).

So it doesn't matter if you are placing a cube because of a disc action or because of a card, it only depends on the active stack.

Note that you can't play a card without having a disc in the active stack (even if you play the card before your disc action, you have to first place a disc and then play the card).

Absolutely nothing wrong with the mechanics.  The action selection grid allows for setting up fancy future moves and it well thought -out.  The scoring system is also ok.  But my big, nagging feeling is that the game is so lacking of theme and flare that it is really boring in the end.  There is no more of a cube pusher than this one.  Ialso found the scoring tiebreaker too strong.  Even the art was rather dull.

In Calimala, players execute two actions by placing their player disc between the two associated action tiles on the grid. Other players can subsequently place on the same spot by placing on top of the already placed disc, but all action discs underneath will get to take those actions as well. The exception is the fourth placed disc--this will execute as normal for the first three discs, but the fourth one will be moved to the council area and trigger a scoring corresponding to the next available scoring tile. Actions include getting wood, bricks, marble, and cloth, building ships, trading posts, and workshops, delivering to coastal towns via ships, delivering to inland towns via trading posts, and contributing resources to local buildings. The number of discs on action spots will never decrease, so once they get up to three, lots of scoring will happen quickly. This game is all about flow, and I can imagine that many would call it elegant. For me though, it lacks a hook that would truly make it interesting.

One thing is for sure: my first play didn't convince me at all. We laid the action tiles randomly, but I certainly wouldn't recommend that. If 2 basic resources are put next to each other, the advantage can be huge for the starting player.

Not the game for me. Way too fiddly and messy. Seemed interesting in the first play but we didn't finish - once I played the full time through just too drawn out and long towards the end and just a mess of bonus actions and insane player turns. No clear order of operations and it was overall frustrating.

RATING: 10
This game is nuts. It's an area majorities game that gives you very few actions across the whole game, but when you place an action disk, you place it on a space between two actions. You then get to resolve both actions. If later, someone places a disk on top of your disk, they get both actions and then you get both actions again. The same thing happens if a third disk gets placed on top. Then things get even more crazy as if a fourth disk goes on top, the disk on the bottom, rather than activate the actions, goes up to the scoring area and activates scoring for the next unscored criteria. In a scoring tie, ties break in favor of whomever had the most components in the scoring area. The game starts off slowly but then suddenly you have stacks of three disks everywhere, and a cavalcade of scoring commences, and it's your job to be ready for it. This tension is delicious.

Because actions are very limited, players need to be very aware of who is getting free actions and when as a result of their placements. It's marvelous because.it's much more common in euro games for the player interaction to manifest in blocking other players from what they want to do, but here that's flipped on it's head.  It is possible that if you have a player who isn't paying attention to the board state that they might cause the leader to run away with things, so I wouldn't necessarily play this with that sort of player. With a group of engaged attentive opponents, this game sings beautifully.

Every once in awhile a magical 60 min ish euro with real depth comes along and makes me very happy, and this is absolutely a member of that club.

A relatively simple game with an interesting action selection and scoring mechanism.  Each game can vary greatly depending on the action and scoring tile locations.  The variability makes the game challenging and it adds to the replayability.  However, the same variability can also make some games very limited with very few good options to choose from.  Those games will not be fun.

Much like other games from the publisher (Kraftwagen and West of Africa), Calimala is a game with a tricky tempo. Players place discs between two action tiles to trigger both actions, and get to trigger them again whenever another disc is placed on top. But if a fourth disc is placed, then a scoring round is triggered in addition.

The disc placement mechanism is simple yet really smart, and works well in conjunction with the scoring round trigger. You have to anticipate where opponents are likely to take future actions so that you would be able to benefit from additional activations. 

The majority scoring system functions well as a means towards the end, although it suffers a little from a slightly convoluted tie-breaking system. I'm not too big a fan of the spreadsheet-like appearance of cubes populating the board, nor the oversized map in a game involving zero spatial considerations. I'm probably most wary about the luck of the card draw. Given how tight the game is, it seems as if a lucky card draw can tip the game in your favour.

Rating just based on a play through, but I'm looking forward to playing it again ASAP. I'm not averse to a Euro anyway, but Calimala has extra stuff going in in the surprising amount of interaction, luck-pushing and tactical brinkmanship. And it looks like it moves fast as well.

Players compete to win majorities in the 20+ scorings by placing on spaces between two actions, getting both; if the space was occupied, previous players also get the actions again. When a stack reaches 3 high, a scoring will be triggered each time it is taken again. Pretty much everything you do will be scored at some point, so the game is in timing and efficiency (there's also some mild engine building). The point spread is such that a low-effort second place is usually where you want to be, but of course a low level of effort can easily be surpassed...

It's smooth, fast, themeless and, unfortunately, surprisingly chaotic. The action grid can develop such that players unpredictably trigger scorings they don't care about, though this presumably diminishes with experience, but it's the random action cards that kill it: players who can't do an action get a substitute action card instead, to be used before/after an action at another time. For a game based on slim majorities this essentially means that any player can potentially whip out a secret action card, or half a dozen secret action cards, and ruin even the best planned strategy. 

Close to being a very good game, but misses the mark.

RATING: 7
This game is a one trick pony, but that one trick is a pretty damn good one.  The rules regarding playing cards (can only play a card as part of a before/after taking an action window) leads to some unnecessarily convoluted situations.  Make sure if you can do one action but not another, you draw your card first (resolve the draw a card option for not being able to perform an action), as if you do it the other way around, you will be unable to play any card you draw that turn.  That's fiddly for no good reason, but when you can play a card is explicitly stated in the rulebook as I described, and playing a card when you cannot take an action is also explicitly forbidden in the rules.

Overall, I think the game would be better without the random card draws.  I think instead of drawing a card when you cannot execute an action, you should get one coin.  Then, on your turn, spend 2 coins to take any one action.  Spend 3 coins if you want to take a second action of your choice...4 coins, etc.  That would reduce the randomness of the card draws, and you could add a scoring marker for most coins as well.

Another problem - turn order means a lot in this game, especially given how critical being in the lead for tiebreaker is.  In the first game I played, I literally lost 12-15 points because of being behind in the tiebreaker.  Because of my turn position and the fact that others raced to build artwork in the council area, I was behind.  Then, going last in turn order also makes your discs less likely to be pushed out onto the council first as well, further compounding your ability to compete for ties.  That was miserable.

But again, this game performs its one trick quite well, enough so that it carries the game to a solid 7 rating.

Feels like an old school German style euro- and that's a good thing. The main draw of the game is definitely the cool action selection mechanism where action discs get reactivated when a new one is put on top. It's not the only draw, however. When a fourth action discs is put on a stack the lowest is removed and triggers a scoring round. Action spaces and scoring tiles are the same in each game but they get laid out in a different way each game so you have to adapt your strategy to that.

Played once. The action selection is the standout mechanic-- lots of leeching/shared incentive considerations. At the end of each round an area-majority scoring happens somewhere, so players are largely chasing where the scoring goes. During setup the 15 unique scoring tiles are laid out so you see the order in which scoring is going to happen, creating a strategic element to the game-- you plan ahead and pick and choose your battles for VP. The scoring works well enough as a backdrop to the action selection, though it does epitomize the term cube-pusher. Want to play a few more times to explore some different approaches to the action selection.

Good game. I like it a lot. 

It is a fun mid to light-weight Euro with simultaneous action selection combined with area control. It plays best with 4 or 5 players. Three is good too, but the more the merrier. There is much more strategy to it than one might initially think. It is a highly interactive Euro which keeps everyone's attention. This I like a great deal. I will state here that I am not a fan of multiplayer solitaire. I do not see this as a fiddly game, although you need to keep track of who receives the bonus actions in a stack.

There are many options on how to proceed on your turn, but as the rules say you need to think several scoring turns ahead. Thus, going where everyone  else is going may not be the best move. While people shoot for the next scoring marker in the city council, one should be thinking about scoring later on. Also, it is important to try to extend one's presence in as many places as possible in order to claim as many victory points as they are able. 

The game is a giving game. In other words, the simultaneous action selection and the ability to take a card always ensures that you can do something. The cards can be played before or after you have placed your disk and are drawn if you cannot take an action on the action selection board, Since they can be played before or after you have placed your disk, they can be sued to take a cascading turn. The white cubes are useful and should be employed rather than hording them until later in the game when the action selection board fills up. If they are on the bottom they will delay scoring and thus possibly give the player another chance to extend their area influence before scoring occurs. Also, they double your actions. 

My only real issue with the game is with the early scoring. Scoring often comes quickly and early, so in some of the early scoring places it is hard to gain victory points. This is likely influenced by the action selection part of the board especially if there is one spot everyone wants. Then again, rather than following the herd it is better to look ahead and spread out your tentacles. Players with AP may struggle. So will players who play to block other players because they fail to see that not everyone has the same goal and that by choosing a location where other player's will not necessarily hurt them depending on what their objective is. Herein is the strategy though.

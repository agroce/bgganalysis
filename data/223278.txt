Bought it after liking Suburbia and Castles of Mad King Ludwig. Just played it once so far 2 player. Looking forward to a 4 player go at it as I think it will be much better with more players.

Mixes suburbia with castles, but also removes the individual boards for a single one.  The game seems to be fairly well balanced and introduces interesting choices on what to do with the 6 spaces.  You can upgrade and/or have end game conditions, but with only 6 spaces you have to choose carefully.

Will need to play again to see how it matures on additional plays.

This game seems to be getting a lot of criticism for the conflict, but after a few times playing it's been a welcome addition to the other two Alspach games I love. I wouldn't compare it to Suburbia or Castles, but using familiar mechanics it manages to be its own thing. I really enjoy this game.

Before I say the rest: I love Suburbia, but don't really like Castles of MKL. This game is definitely better than the Castles, but it still couldn't become a good game. It's way tooo fiddly. Too much administration. Pkace the tile there,  then administer it on your board. Get the swan. Check the rooms. If completed, check what happens. Count and place the moats coming. Do it each and every turn. O, and you also have to remember all the goals, secret goals and roons providing you point at the end, and of course remember your opponents' scoring rooms to not give them points during the game. A horror, really...

RATING: 7
Solid tile laying game, with a million ways to score points.   The ways the game ends are interesting for sure, and it does add a good bit of tension at the end of the game.  You don't really get into the "theme" on this one as much as Castles of Mad King Ludwig, but it is very much its own game.  I think the game met my expectations, but for sure didn't exceed them, however I do see getting at least a few more plays out of this one.  Will have to see how this plays with 2 players...

RATING: 7.5
Nice sequel to Castles, played a demo at Gen Con. Although it lacks the Tetris-y pieces which are a highlight of the original, the shared interaction of building off other's rooms is a nice new mechanism. Fun and looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 6
Played at Gen Con and was left a bit underwhelmed by this "sequel" considering Castles of Mad King Ludwig is in my top 10. The gameplay is solid, offers lots of replayability through the tiles and goals, and I love the various special powers that can be unlocked during the game. However, I thought the choice of changing the tiles to all small, square, Carcassone-like tiles led to some poor graphic desig: the symbols were a bit hard to read at times especially when putting tokens on top, and in a few cases we had to double-check to make sure we even had the right type of room. The game could also have a lot of take that when placing most tiles or by connecting someone else's entrance to a wall to prevent the tile from scoring. I did also miss the auction element found in Castles. I would definitely recommend to try it first before buying due to the big differences from the original.

I enjoyed my first play at Origins 2017.  I like it better than the Castle of Mad King Ludwig.  I liked how you are building a common board and that the current player does not have to determine the order of the tiles like in Mad King Ludwig.

RATING: 4
It's a tile selecting/laying point salad type game.  

Hesitated between a 3 and a 4 as the "fun" factor is simply not present for me.

There are way too many things one has to take into consideration on one's board, yet you also need to check what the other players need or are trying to do.

Too often I found myself picking one objective and trying to accomplish it as planning more than one move ahead is essentially pointless, as have to adapt to a changing board, tile offer and player actions, re-evaluating at the start of each of your turn...  way too AP prone for my liking.

Will most likely never play this again, but was happy to have given it a try.

Players at the table mentioned its predecessor was more enjoyable.  I have little interest in finding out.

I like this game better than Castles of Mad King Ludwig.  Players place tiles in one shared palace, which allows for good player interaction.  I like being able to unlock different abilities on my player board and aim for personal end game goals.

RATING: 5
The shared building space and the limited number of drafting options almost entirely kill any kind of meaningful strategy you are thinking of coming up with. You simply can't even start thinking about what you're going to do until it's actually your turn because someone at the table with surely mess something up that will change your plans for the worst. All the way throughout the game, I felt uninspired and unchallenged. Way too much randomness. The game is also extremely finicky with tiny token that need to be placed on the board and flipped at some later point. Too many components that can too easily be bumped and moved around.

RATING: N/A
Got to play a full game of this at GenCon (we really would have been fine with a 15 minute demo). It has a lot of the same room types and concepts as Castles, but it plays differently enough that I would happily own both. There was a lot going on and the moat encroaching on your building is an interesting mechanic. It felt more cutthroat than Castles. We played with all 4 players, so I'm interested to see how it plays with 2.

Aug17:

Tipped just a bit too far into "point salad", without going full-bore.  Seemed to be at an awkward middle-ground.

The moats added a pretty direct "take-that", which I didn't really enjoy.  (I much preferred the market pricing from Castles.)

I understand that not finishing rooms makes a tension, but it was also just frustrating.  Didn't leave a great taste in my mouth.

RATING: 6
The game promises _a_lot_ after the rules' explanation, but delivers not so much during the actual play.

There are some development issues (like bonuses to unlock - of which some seem much better than the other ones; weak bonuses for closing some rooms etc.), luck/randomness, but ultimately the game is just not refined and exciting enough.

Not as exciting than 'Castles of Mad King Ludwig', but not bad either. There are a lot of similarities to CoMKL, but couple of major changes as well: no more pricing the tiles, but now all the players are building in the same area. There is a mechanism which gives you benefits if you help others, but in a same time some elements to screw your opponents. I liked it, but I don't see such a clever ideas, why should I buy it. But PoMKL is one of these games, which I would love to play again.

Tile-laying game with no restrictions for placement but not rewards for idle placement.  Very nice visually, and really interesting implementation of player board utility.  I've not played Castles of MKL, but this Palaces thing seemed alright.

RATING: 8
Played at Spiel. Surprisingly good (and different) follow-up to Castles, which is one of my favourite games. The building of a shared palace adds interesting player interactions as you try to help yourself without helping your opponents too much. The ability to make your opponents' rooms un-completable--either with the moat or blocking off doors--means this is potentially nastier than Castles, but not in an overdone way. Overall, not as pretty as Castles, but strangely simpler (at least for me) because it's easier to see what's going on in a shared play area. Most importantly, it IS a different game and there's a place for both in the collection.

Possibly a game that I'll enjoy more than its predecessor, primarily because it removes the market pricing phase from Castles, which either lead to AP or was a crapshoot in most of my previous plays. The sense of satisfaction in your construction is reduced, though, which was half of the appeal of the original. It's replaced with player interaction and that player interaction can be quite mean, usually in the form of preventing others from completing rooms. It's also fiddly as heck, with each turn requiring several small bookkeeping steps.

Not an awful game, per se, but easily the fiddliest non-FFG game I’ve played in years.  It didn’t need to be this admin heavy for this light of a game.  Didn’t find the tile play that clever, didnt find the passive-aggressive screwage that palatable, didn’t find the overall game that fun - halfway through, I started wishing we were playing Suburbia instead.

That’s been happening a lot with the Class of 2017 - mediocre games that remind me of much better games.

The Palace of Mad King Ludwig is a follow-up to Castles of Mad King Ludwig in which players are all competing to build the same palace. Players place a square tile in the grid, marking their ownership with a chit. Then, players get swan tokens for door colors that they've matched, and get a bonus when the room is completed (all doors are aligned with other doors). Tiles are available via a sliding draft, much like in Suburbia, and can be discarded for general-use hallways. This game also features both public and private goals, and rewards types of room played in both similar and different sets, and swan tokens for different sets. Unfortunately, the game is not nearly as interesting as the designer's earlier titles, as it neither has the puzzly aspect of Castles nor the synergies and income management of Suburbia. It's not a bad game, but it's not great either.

Super excited for this title. Played in prototype form and there is still a lot being worked on in terms of development.

RATING: 5
Even though it has the same theme as its predecessor Castles, this game is a totally different animal. In this game, players are all building rooms for a communal palace for the Mad King. This game is one of the most cutthroat games I've ever seen. There are so many ways to screw other players such as driving moats into their rooms so that they can't be completed. The playtime is highly variable depending on how many rooms get completed in the early stages. If a bunch of utility rooms come out, the game ends super quickly. If people build a lot of rooms with many entrances at the beginning, this slows the moat mechanic and can allow the castle to sprawl a bit. It's also quite fiddly because you have to use player markers to mark each person's rooms on the palace and on your own board. Too vicious, and I would always prefer Castles.

(first reaction) Solid middle ground between Castles and Suburbia, but a little too much busywork in places. The uniformity of the rooms made it harder to track exactly what was going on, although the variety of strategic routes felt good (three players finished within 10 of each other despite pursuing very different approaches.)
I think I'd still rather play Castles with a group that has internalised the price-setting mechanism, but for any other situation this is a lot more accessible.

RATING: 6
Felt like an advanced Carcassonne with its more indepth scoring and moat to limit your expansions. Buildling a palace together is interesting but loses a bit of theme and engagement compared to Castles of Mad King Ludwig, where I really felt like I was building my own castle. Here I didn't really get a feeling of building a castle, but instead it was just laying down tiles of different colors. 
Not a bad game at all but not something I will be looking forward for more plays.

Rating after one play @Essen. So, this time we build the same palace together, not everybody their own tableau. The procedure of placing and avluating a tile is a bit fiddly, and there are 4 open and about two hidden goals per player. This combination makes the game a bit too opaque for my taste.

Tried this at Gen Con 2017 and strongly disliked it. 

-Board is too busy. Colored doors, colored tiles, colored player pieces... it is hard to keep track of what is what.

-Too luck based. Since you can mostly ever just buy the tiles in the bottom two spots, you had better hope there happens to be something good there.

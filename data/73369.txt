+ Amazing, very fitting art.
+ Stellar visual design of cards.
+ Very creative approach to card design. Three different modes of playing every card is wow!

- Plays out too... mechanically. Too dry. All the flavor is right there in your hands, dripping from cards, waiting to get out... but the game is pure mechanics.
- The rules are all over the place and there are just so many of them. 
- Iconography is plentiful but often impressively nonintuitive.

Will play it more, hopefully getting a good enough grasp on the game to manage to imagine more flavor of whats going on during play time.

Wow! 1st play comment. (Autumn 2011) In-depth card game. Rounds are drafting - producing - actions - score vps - clean up. 

Everyone starts a post-apocalyptic (Neuroshima Hex) U.S.A. base card and utilizes faction actions to place cards in their tableau. Each card (locale) may either be conquered, negotiated or incorporated within the territory and confers distinctive benefits for the choices. 

Greatness!

(Sold to make room on my shelves.)

I like the theme, and it feels like I should really engage with the game.  The pacing feels very odd, though.  The game seems to be engineered to end juuuust before everyone's engines get going.  Games with my group seem to end after 3-5 rounds, so I question the usefulness of making VP deals.  I feel a little unsatisfied after a game ends, and I'm not quite sure why.

Sort of a "crafting" game where you gather resources and convert them into more resources to build engines to generate points.  

I really like it but it is a bit hard to teach others.  It's like it has 1 too many links.

Especially due to the symbols.

I like how the mechanics match the theme, but others may see it as too mechanical.

The expansions streamlines the game some and makes it a better game.



New Era
It's bit of a weird analogy but I enjoy crafting in video games and this game does a good job of having that same feel of getting resources to convert into bigger, better things.

I enjoy the thematic nature of the game's cards.

I like that you are building multiple engines rather than 1.  Rather than building an engine and ending the game too soon, you have a chance to see different engines work to their full extent.


It is a pain to teach but I am getting better at it as i play it more with different people.

Unpolished game with lots of (unnecessary?) complexity. There is a lot of potential and I really liked playing it, but it felt that the game could had been developed better. The game seems to be really balanced and there are many routes to reach same points. In the end the winning margin has always under 5 points. Unfortunately the game has so many phases, actions, cards, victory point chips and different type of resources going back and forth that it's hard to say after the game how many points were gained and lost because of errors.

Really sparks my interested for Imperial Settlers!

Loving this one so far. Easy play even with all the actions, icons and scoring options. It just flows really well. Nice artwork to boot. There is a bit of a learning curve for the first few games we think. But that hurdle is easily jumped once you get the game pacing and actions down pat. It is at its heart a resource management game and a fun one to boot.

RATING: 7
This is another one of those economic snowball, setup resource production and convert resources into VPs card games, similar to Race for the Galaxy. There are, however, a couple of unique features I enjoyed and that give the game its own flavour: there's three different ways of using cards, which all serve the same function (give resources or points), but which are completely different in execution; the snowball effect is curtailed in a rather thematic way, as the VP generation buildings have limited uses; and the resources are represented by separate counters, which means all the cards become usable but makes the game a bit fiddly.

The decision making also seems a bit different than the norm. Here, it's not a question of which cards to build and which to discard, but instead how and when to use them. There's also a much more complex resource allocation system. The factions seemed different in character, but I think a lot of it depends also on getting the right leader, otherwise you'll probably end up playing in similar ways.

Unfortunately, this all makes the game play sequential rather than simultaneous, which leads to what is to me the biggest weakness of this game: play time. The truth is, you could play two or three games of Race for the Galaxy in the time it takes to play 51st State. And apart from the odd play for variety, I'd play those two or three instead.

RATING: 8.5
Not a theme that endears itself to me, but one that works well for the game, which is somewhere in the RftG, Glory to Rome arena.  Plenty going on and a little fiddly.  The card drafting seemed unnecessarily complicated and is biased toward the start player presumably to counter the perceived advantage that later players will have more cards to choose to play from later in the game.  Our first game was close. There are clearly combinations that work well together.  Cards have several alternative uses which are nicely keyed in with resources and abilities.  But need to keep track of what you are doing carefully.  Enjoyed (as I enjoy RftG and GtR) and wish to own.

Second play, two players.  Same feel as RftG.  If anything, even more choices the RftG, many not immediately obvious,  Possibly too many available.  Bought on stregnth of plays, increase rating from 7 to 8.5.

A témája egyáltalán nem keltette fel az érdeklődésemet (max. a neve), csak a társaság kedvéért próbáltam ki, a várakozásomhoz képest végül is nem okozott csalódást, de túl nagy élményt sem adott.

Egy átlagos ikonos kártyajáték, amiket alapból se szeretek (ha már 2-3 órát játékkal töltök, akkor inkább egy normális táblás játék, mint egy ilyen), ezt meg még külön erőltetettnek érzem, túl sok eredeti dolgot nem mutat, és sok a holtidő. 
És ami nagyon amatőr, hogy nagyon kevés a jelölő (pl. az emberből az elejétől kezdve nem volt elég...).

A pontszámítás tetszett viszont, és az ikonok se voltak vészesek.

Nagyobb a füstje mint a lángja, egy időre elég volt ez az egy parti...

The best card game I've played. It would have 10/10, but for me there's too little interaction between players and there are no real combats (which definetely should be in post nuclear world). It has great potencial and I'm sure there will be some expansions in near future.

Edit, 19 Sep 2011
Still like it, but I've found some better card games:
At the Gates of Loyang,
A Few Acres of Snow,
Glory to Rome

Note stays 8/10. I'm looking forward for new expansion The New Era.

Interesting engine building card game. There is card drafting and a lot of resource management. Game is pretty fiddly and therefore also quite slow. But the theme really works and I do like the Neuroshima setting very much. Interaction is there but not in abundant quantities. Components are of relatively good quality. But some of the design choices puzzle me. Esspecially the scoreboard on the back of the box and the tiny, tiny first player token. But all in all a solid game I would like to explore more.

51st State does not hit any of my buttons. There is a huge potential snowball effect by which some players can play double the time, the game can drag with very long turns, tableaus end up with so many cards you stop caring about what others have (solitaire feel)... I just think there are many better card games out there, so I will try to avoid further plays.

Where to start.   The rules suck.  Really, really suck.   The problem is that they use all these dumb made-up role-playing terms when trying to describe standard mechanics.   They don't say MONEY or CURRENCY but rather 3 different weird words that have nothing to do with money or currency.  

Cards are also hugely multi-purpose, and have over 59 different icons on them.   This makes learning the game very difficult and mentally taxing.

The game itself is actually pretty good I think.   It's race-for-the-galaxyish, and I personally enjoyed it more than race for the galaxy.  Then again, I've never really understood or appreciated race for the galaxy so this isn't saying much.

Still, the game mostly makes sense while playing it and once you get the basic structure of the game down.

I'll probably play this once more and then then trade it away if we don't find it to be super-fantastic.   I can't imagine ever actually teaching this to anyone else though.

Initial rating.... 2 for some strange general design decisions and awful rules, 7 for gameplay.   overall 5.

51st State has been around for awhile now, but I'm just getting to play it. For starters we got some rules wrong... Mainly we allowed every location to hold three conquests or deals, this really changed the way the game plays. It took us awhile for someone to score 30 points, but I think with repeated plays this would turn into a really quick game. I'd like to get this to the table a few more times to see if any of the strategies I've thought about actually work, but I'm not sure my group will agree. With repeated plays I could see my rating of this game increasing.

RATING: 7
A very interesting multi-use card game in the vein of San Juan or Race for the Galaxy, though it has a much different feel. This might be due to the theme (which I love), but it's also because you know most of the cards other players are picking up in the draft. This means you need to keep tabs on other players much more carefully than in SJ or RftG. Your ability to do well will depend on making sure other players' interests don't get in the way of your own. 

Each turn is a challenge as you try to puzzle out the best possible way to play the cards in your hand, comboing the cards you've already laid out in front of you. The "three card rule" is very constraining, and often makes Conquest a far more tempting action than Communication, which has only limited income benefits. A great design, one of Trzewicek's best.

I enjoyed my one playing of this game, but would need to play it some more to make the gameplay flow smoother.  It reminds me a bit of "Race for the Galaxy" in that there are a lot of cards with different uses on them.  A big part of the strategy of the game is to get cards out quickly and don't worry too much about building an "engine".  As soon as a card has filled its role, get rid of it by building on top of it (and getting bonus victory points to boot!)

RATING: 8
The rules are written very abstract, even though sticking closer to the theme would have facilitated their understanding. Add to this the unintuitive iconography and you get a game that takes a lot of time to get warm with. Then, however, it is quite rewarding, with a well implemented theme and very interesting and meaningful decisions. For the patient gamer!

It's fairly derivative, iconography for the building powers is at times not awesome, and the theme is decent but not great. But I liked it. It's a nice engine-building/bootstrapping game that fits in somewhere alongside San Juan. The early game is actually the most interesting part of the game, as you have to carefully plot out your initial expansion, while the later game tends to run on cruise control. Good ratio of complexity to gameplay depth; it's a fairly straightforward, teachable game with decent depth to it. I wish the theme were a little stronger and the endgame a little cleaner, but it certainly works well enough. Tip: it's never a bad idea, and rarely to early, to start generating VPs.

All in all, nowhere near being in the same quality ballpark as San Juan or Race for the Galaxy, but we've played San Juan a lot, 51st State is more accessible than Race, and in fairness it is a distinct game from either with its own charms.

Tried the game out as a replacement for Race for the galaxy. I figured a tableau/engine building card game could scratch the same itch. Unfortunately the game fell kind of flat for us. I liked several ideas, the different civs, the possible specializations possible and the multiple uses cards. Unfortunately, I felt the game to be a bit too messy. It lacks elegance. Apart from that, it seems like a game that we should enjoy  lot more and I am having a hard time saying precisely what I don't like about it. Perhaps the way cards enter your hand. One of the greatest design decisions of RFTG is that you pay with cards in hand which allows you to have much more control over your strategy, notably, I felt you di dnot have enough control over the leaders one would get. The draft just is not enough for us. Also, in RFTG, there is a real engine that escalates quickly but in 52st state, it seems like the game's pace does not change much.

Tentative rating.  The game is good, and the decisions about how to use a card are fun, but there isn't a lot of interaction.  Though there is some.

Second play with 2 was good.  It raised interactivity a little.  Starting to know the rules enough to actually focus on playing well.

I love the massive open-ended possibilities.  I've heard it described as "a race to see who can break the game first." Still, it is an imposing game to learn/teach, and I might have trouble finding players.  Probably the most potential out of any of my favorite tableau-builders.

Excellent theme and game system.  Some 3 additional slot cards and leaders may provide unbalance situation.  I need more time to test for these issues.  
The only draw back (-1 mark) from this game is using paper tokens.  Lack of player interaction may not be a problem for solo player. 
This game may only be good for solitaire.  Need more time to test play on it.

I really like how the theme fits so well with how you use the cards in this game. This is more finicky than it should be, though. Imperial Settlers proves this, although Imperial Settlers is maybe more stripped down than it needed to be (but then, expansions will probably fix that). Anyway, it's decent game.

For about 2 hours we tried to make any sense of the German rules for this game but finally we gave up. The rules are not only very poorly structured but are also full of typos, grammatical errors, and sentences that do not make any sense at all. To complete the confusion, different terms are used for the same items or issues throughout the rules. Also half of the rules seem to consist of different incarnations of "this will be explained at a later point" - but sadly it won't be. Reading this phrase over and over again provided the most fun we got out of this game since it became a running gag over the course of the day. This should not happen with a game that says "Second Revised Edition" on the box. Rules have to be proof-read by someone who is a native speaker of the given language. These clearly were not. So up to now this game is clearly broken to us since we are not able to play it. It's a shame because we very much would have enjoyed the theme of the game in our gaming group. (This is for the German Portal Publishing (2010) Second Revised Edition.)

Was super excited to get this but really let down both in trying to get it to the table and explain the fiddly rules.  Taking small tokens off cards and then putting them back on and moving them to different cards, the teme did not come through for me at all, whereas in I find its shared property/inspiration big brother Neuroshima is really quite thematic.  Still needs more plays to know for sure but this may have been as I just have other better options.

RATING: 5
First few plays have been fun, and some of the mechanics are very pleasing, but the last game or two I've been in  have felt a touch too short (play-wise) / long (time-wise). The former is less worrisome; there are many good games where a novice player is quite apt to feel like the game's just getting started when it ends; the latter could be more problematic.

Also, some of the iconography needs improvement - most desperately the depictions of various draft/draw-related powers, which are phenomenally unintuitive; we still have to look each one up as it arises.

[After playing a bit more and observing a number of games] Leaders seem really, really good. Possibly too good. Not having opportunity to draw one certainly hurts a lot.

[2011-10-13 Rating: n.a. -> 7]

It took me a long time to come up with a rating for 51st State. The first hurdle was the rules. I got my copy with the german language rules which are wrong in so many places that it wasn't funny anymore. After downloading and reading the first edition english rules things went better but still not smooth. Even the english rules weren't written that good and important stuff was hidden in examples. Nevertheless, after spending more time on the rules for 51st State than on the instructions of Conflict of Heroes, it hit the table.

It was then that I discovered that I don't really get the iconography. I still have to look things up in the manual from time to time. But I did also discover that this game is fun. You are building your own victory point engine which is hopefully faster than the engine of the other players. This is something I do really enjoy.

However, after some plays I noticed how solitaire the gameplay of 51st State is. After the initial card draft, some card leeching and with the exception of two or three "attack" cards, there is no way in which you can interact with the other players. Everyone is doing their own stuff until someone reaches 30 points. This isn't too different from Race for the Galaxy, but there everyone can do their stuff simultaneously. In 51st State you have to sit through a series of actions that won't affect you until it's your turn again.

This sounds more negative than it should. In my book 51st State is some good fun. I do still prefer Race for the Galaxy but 51st State is a nice distraction from time to time. If you want to learn the game, read the rules that come with the expansion [i]The New Era[/i]. They are lightyears better.

This is an engine building game with minimal player interaction, just a victory point race.  The rulebook definitely leaves something to be desired, but the game is actually not that complex once you understand the icons and card types.  It seems like a nice step up from the gameplay style and complexity level of San Juan.  There is a learning curve, and the game leaves you with a feeling that there is more depth to explore.  There is some luck based on what cards you get in your opening hand, but there is a significant amount of both strategy and tactics as well.  The theme is there but somewhat thin, the actual functions of the cards are complex enough that you don't usually spend the extra effort to focus on the theme of the card. So far, the intricacy of the card combos, the number of different cards, and the possibilities of different strategies based on the assymetric factions all provide this game with some serious replay value.  Looking forward to exploring the strategies further.

Először is azzal kezdeném, hogy a szabálykönyv nincs elegánsan megírva. Gyakorlatilag oda-vissza ugráltam benne, hogy megértsem a szabályokat. Végül egy videó segítségével sikerült a játékmenetről teljes képet kapni. 3 fővel próbáltuk ki, amivel nagyszerűen működött, habár a játékidő eléggé elnyúlt, szabálymagyarázattal együtt volt vagy 3 óra ("megfontolt" játékosok vagyunk :)). Nagyon szeretem ezt az "engine building" mechanikát. A szabályok elsajátításának nehézségei ellenére a játékmenet két-három kör után teljesen letisztult és a forduló kezdeti "megfigyelési fázisában" (meghatározott szabályok szerinti lap felhúzás) már érdemben tudtunk válogatni az 5 darab felcsapott kártyalap közül. Nálunk az első játék során a körönként győzelmi pontot biztosító helyszínekkel történő "szövetségkötés" (a kártyalap kék sávjának használata) és "Mr President" vezető döntötte el a győzelmet. Nagyon tetszett a lapok többféleképpen történő felhasználása körüli dilemma és nagyon élvezetesnek találtam ezt a fajta játékmenetet. Nehezebb, mint egy családi játék, de szerintem megéri a fáradozást. Most már kíváncsi vagyok, hogyan sikerült a "Master Set" verzió. (2017.12.30.)

A card game that is very cool in concept and strategy, but dang if it isn't hard to learn.  The rulebook is one of the worst I've ever read and there are a LOT of rules.  It's cool as a two-player game, but I think it really shines with 4 players when there are more opportunities to visit another player's building.  It's a game that takes a few plays to figure out, which I find really rewarding.

RATING: 4
51st State starts off with a great premise in that you can use most card in one of three ways: one off short term gain, incremental benefit every round, or 1 VP + Special ability.  This game even included a draft every round.  How could it go wrong?  It's fiddly as all get out, for one.   There are literally about 14 different piles of resources going on that you'll need to sort from a smaller amount of baggies or bagging/de-bagging of 12ish baggies.  Either way, it's tedious.  Every round of the game you'll gain these resources, move these resources around during the action phase and then discard all but the VP tokens during clean up.  That's way too many moving resources.  That doesn't even include the cards that will typically be moved in a round either.  

While all of that is annoying, it's something I could live with.  To go deeper into the issues with the game, let's start with cards.  Very few card abilities have to do with drawing cards.  Most of the time you'll get a static 3 cards per round.  Two of which are drafted and 1 of which is of the top of the deck.  Choices are sometimes very limited due being stifled by the card draw... compare with RftG when you can explore for 3 - 7 cards + modifiers every turn, not including card draws from other sources.  Leaders seem unbalanced in the game.  They can be played for free, they come with free resources that do not get discarded during cleanup, they can accrue 5 VP instead of the normal 3 rule for locations, and you they will typically give you VP for just playing cards whereas normal VP gaining methods usually require you to use a worker and pay some sort of resource.  In Race you need to pay a hefty cost to play 6 cost developments which makes a lot more sense.

Simply put, why play 51st State when there are better tableau based card games out there?  I know I mentioned Race, but I think I would even consider, London, Gosu, Glory to Rome and Innovation to be better choices.

The rulebook could be improved but perhaps this is because it's the translation?  
First play took some time get up the learning curve, but in retrospect I'm not sure why because the game itself is not complex.  There were interesting elements:  how the cards work, and the high water mark scoring.  There is a bit of luck with the cards that become available.  It's another game where you have to play to the cards that come your way.  
If everyone is equally good at maximizing their opportunities, then the difference in score will be down to the luck of the draw, player order, etc.

The rules do really really suck.  The way leaders work is kinda screwy too, meaning that they can be a huge windfall during the draft.

I love the general type of game this is though, with cards being usable several different ways.

I've heard the expansion fixes a lot of the things that this one got wrong, but I'm loathe to put more good money after bad (plus they changed the iconography, improving it, but making it incompatible with the base game... sigh).

Well, this game got dumped for $15 and Imperial Settlers basically fires it.

Rules were confusing until the first play.  

It takes longer than I like for this type of game.  I would rather see it play in an hour than an hour and a half.  I think it will speed up considerably once cards are known--the symbols are not intuitive so we had to keep looking them up.  There were no player aids with the game, although there is a nice file here on BGG. 

I very much like it that the different races have different advantages.

I find the cards interesting and appealing.  I don't like the scoreboard on the bottom of the box--seems unwieldy.

The other players hope the next expansion brings more interaction in the forms of bargaining or aggression.  I think it will just make the game more complicated, and longer. I like it the way it is.  I am looking forward to expansions but hope they are for a variety of races, more cards, etc.  

I suspect with more plays, of which I am sure this game will get, I will raise the rating.

EDIT: After 6 plays rating go down to 6. I discovered "rebuilder-kill the leader" strategy which seems to be the strongest one.:(

EDIT: after 4 plays I see that my initial thoughts were good. The game is really cool but it lacks interaction. Waiting for expansion which fix that;)

It is not my type of game but after one play seems to be really interesting. I want to play more. The biggest drawback is almost no interaction. Using other players buildings is definitely to little. I spent most of the time looking at my cards, in silence. So the game doesn't create emotions between players which is one of the most important parts of gaming experience for me.

No! No interaction. Drafting and stealing is so much not an interaction (stealing is extremely rare)? Using other's buildings a'la Caylus is ok, but totally not enough and it seems it can't be used as a part of the strategy.
Card game with tons of tokens? I thought I was palying a prototype, an early prototype with some ideas undeveloped.
Iconography is not as clear as in RftG. Maybe with the expansion the game will be good enough to play it. Now I just want to play again to check if it's as bad as I've found it at the first glance. Then - you won't force me to play this.
Names of the cards are soooooo fluffy. Gangers? Mixing polish and english names is also not the best solution.
Right - A LOT of bad comments. But with such a huge hype this should be (and could be! there's a big potential in this one) much better game.
On the very other hand the artwork is fabolous!

EDIT
Fortunately Portal's going to send lacking tokens, nice move.

Comparisons to Race for the Galaxy are fairly true.  Both games make extensive use of icons, which results in a bit of a steep learning curve.  I really like RftG, and feel similarly about 51st state.  The four factions do require very different playing styles.  There is a slow build up as your faction grows more powerful, and I think that planning ahead is crucial.  The one thing that RftG has over 51st state is a brilliant solitaire version.  

This is also a game that can only be improved by more factions and more cards.  

Don't let the haters dissuade you from trying this out.  It takes one or two games to properly learn the icons, by which time you'll rarely, if ever, have to refer to the rulebook.

Seems like other semi-solitaire games like Race for the Galaxy, although I think Race has the decided edge here in terms of player interaction.  However, the mechanics of 51st state work well, and building your little post-apocalyptic empire provides a pretty fun hour.

UPDATE - Second play, with updated version, was boring and frustrating in turns.

Some similarities but more different from RftG then RftG is from Puerto Rico.  Love the theme but I am a Fallout fan.  (Imperial Settlers theme seems kiddie and as much a turn off as the name)  Would love a more streamlined updated version of this theme.

Only con.. scoreboard on the back of the box?  Lol BGG and a laminated print job to the rescue.

Boring, fiddly and unclear. I tried to like this game - I really did. And I failed.

It's not a bad game (that's why I didn't rate it lower) but I had absolutely no fun playing it.

I don't even want to give it a second try. Wasted chance for a great game.

I can see the comparisons to Race for the Galaxy (complex icons, multipurpose cards) but not sure it has the elegance or playtest honing that Race has.  It certainly is going to have a steep learning curve - hope I can keep the group interested, as I think it has potential.

More interaction than in Race for the Galaxy, but still a far cry from being an interactive game. A good multiplayer solitaire though, and tells a compelling story of building a post-apocalyptic society.

RATING: 6
A typical "who gets to the finish line first" game with low player interaction. The randomness of the game kills long-term strategical thinking - you're left with tactical, short term decisions. Too much iconography - you have to check the manual each time (sadly, no player aid sheets). The cards aren't balanced enough. The same goes for the individual player powers. You need to play it a bit to have a chance with more experienced players, it's not intuitive and you have to know the cards by heart. And the manual is missing a F.A.Q. which would answer some questions about the rules.

Still, I enjoyed it as a light, chill out game. It's probably most fun for two players, when you have a bigger choice of cards, it's easier to control what your opponent is doing, and the down-time is minimal.

Really fun game. The only problem is the iconography - most of it is rather intuitive, but a few symbols can be a little tricky. The rest is really great - both the artwork and the game itself. There are opinions that there's little interaction, but I don't think so (there's no negative interaction, but that doesn't bother me at all).

Once I got my head round the rules I found this to be an interesting variant on a tableau building card game a la RftG. The fact that it uses resource tokens rather than cards as payment and goods makes it a little fiddlier, and there can be a little down time, but overall it was fun.

Fairly enjoyable gameplay, but the negative aspects marr the experience. It is a bit too fiddly and much too long. The fact that most cards can be used in three different ways provides some interesting decisions, but it also contributes immensely to the game length as the players analyze all their options. The game may also be too dependent on luck of the draw, even with the card draft, and unbalanced (leader cards, for example, are very good, scarce and free to play). And the rulebook leaves a lot to be desired, complicating simple things and using various concepts before defining them.

Underrated card game that brings all the perks of heavier euro games: resource management, worker placement, hand management and engine building. Some have complained about convoluted rules and copious iconography and tokens, but I disagree. After a couple of plays, everything gels very well and you appreciate how wonderfully streamlined it all is - quick to play and full of tough decisions and strategy. The excellent post apocalyptic theme adds to the appeal too.

RATING: 8.5
Great game system! The way how factions feel different from each other because they are better or worse doing the the three basic actions - How the card values change based on not only what you have in play, but also what your available actions are - How you need to keep track of other's locations so you can use them to your advantage - And how brutally short in turns the game is when played well! It helps that the theme is so well integrated and the art is very good. Fallout the card game!

I think my desire to love the game outdoes my actual love for the game. It is hard to teach, it's not that intuitive and the symbolism may throw off people. And there might be a slight runaway leader problem since it's fairly hard to catch up to someone who has been doing better beforehand. But once all the pieces fall into place, it allows for quite clever plays and very cool combos. It would be nice if the game would flex it's muscles on a more consistent base, but that's how it is.

How difficult is it to make a player aid??  This one is screaming for one.  Had to keep referring to the manual to understand the iconography.

Probably required a few plays to understand the mechanic, but found there was too much luck.  If the cards you need don't come up, you will go through the motion but still finish in last place.  Will you have fun playing?  If you like going back to the rulebook to check the icons from the cards, sure, but I'll pass.

RATING: 3
This game is almost only mechanics. Almost no mechanic makes thematic sense..
You shoot your own leaders to get victory points, while letting all your competitors use your most precious buildings for virtualy nothing..

So what's left then? You'll be playing one of 4 slightly asymetric factions & try to build a VP engine, by comboing cards (getting ressources/actions to get VPs)

But even mechanically speaking i had the feeling that the game wasn't properly balanced, and that some strategies were far superior than others. Sure being able to build a card for three different purposes is neat but this has been done by many other games since and isn't as special as it probably used to be.

If you like euros with a veneer of ameritrash theme on it (like Legends of Andor or Lords of Waterdeep) you'll enjoy this one.

The artwork is good.

First impression (just 1 game) is of a good game, not as similar to Race for the Galaxy as it would seem, with many choices to make and lot of variety coming from the cards.

RATING: 7
Another tableau building card game in the mould of Race for the Galaxy and San Juan. Some frustrations quickly come into view though. The use of four currencies means that it's vital to have a coherent set of buildings, but you get to choose from a very limited set at the beginning of each round, so a good start is very much a matter of luck. You can't just draw more cards or search the deck as you can in RftG, a major omission in my view. Also, the playing time on the box is VERY optimistic, allow a least 2 hours first time you play. Like Glory to Rome this can feel overwhelming at first play, but the dark theme strips the game of GtR's sense of fun, you actually feel downbeat as you play. Well behind the best-of-breed.

RATING: 7
An interesting CCG-ish with an interesting and appealing theme (postapocalyptic economy-building--or destroying--with several different factions available).  The game is quite difficult to comprehend from a quick read of the rules, but seems fairly straightforward afterward.  Since most of the cards can be played in several different ways, it offers up a lot of options, which appears to make many different strategies possible. Curiously for the theme, it really seems to be an engine-building game. Enjoyable. (1 play)

RATING: 4
Neutral - on occasion.

There are some obvious flaws: (1) Production is OK. But the rulebook has much to improve. (2) A fiddly game. The UI isn't very good. Manipulating the tokens somewhat annoyed. (3) For first few games without some understanding into the buildings overall, fuels/workers/... are just resources with different colors that are created and spent repeatedly. Also, some aspects of theme are abstract itself: range/negotiate/...

Multiple uses of cards are not bad, which makes game space really huge, but somehow I'm not particularly interested in(maybe cuz it's too pure engine-building, lacking some thing different, something like simultaneous double-guessing in RftG). I would consider multi player solitaire as a feature rather than a problem, but it may turn-off some people.

I never play other successors(The New Era, Winter & Imperial Settlers), but I believe the successors are there to solve at least one of the problems.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b]

Action-packed would be the best way to describe this clever card-game. I've never had a deck of cards make me feel like every decision and more precisely, when that decision is made, have so much weight. Sequence and timing is pivotal as you build up your post-apocalyptic empire. It's on the verge of being too long for what it is, but as each round grows in length, so too do the weighty choices and exciting possibilities. Some of the combos you can pull off by the end of the game are extremely satisfying. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- The heaviest and most satisfying card game I know. 
- The sense of escalation is top notch. 
- Great mechanism of using another's cards, promoting some interaction.  
- Lots to manage, lots to plan for. (A pro if you're into that like I am). haha. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- It's the longest card game I've ever played by far, often taking around the 90 minute mark. 
- Lots of tiny rules in true Ignacy fashion, but they all just make sense. 
- The Iconology can put a lot of people off the game, as there is A LOT of it here, and not all of it makes sense at first glance.  
- There is a rather strong element of "luck of the draw" here, however assigning cards as invasions, contracts or locations, helps mitigate this a lot.

51st State is an interesting new addition to the 'San Juan' genre of card games, with nice artwork and a fairly convincing theme. The rules takes some time to explain and the first couple of games can be lengthy, but once you know the game then it plays within a reasonable time. Like all games of this type it is luck-based, though the card drafting mechanism mitigates this somewhat. Given the relative complexity I would have expected more scope for strategy than there appears to be.

One of my favourite games. It is true that the core game has some flaws but after adding both expansions (New Era and Winter) it improves a lot.
I love the theme of the game, the cards, I think that everything works very well without losing the theme, I can see if you are adding the school, or making a deal or doing a conquest... the way that you interact with every location and its benefits make total sense to me.
The only point that it does not work very well is the high level of simbology. Even for the experienced players it is absolutely necessary to check the manual, maybe 10 times or more during a single game, for understanding a certain card. 
Another problem that I guess that it will be solved with the master set is the fact that there are some rules that have been changed in different expansions, so you may have some issues founding what is the last updated versión of the rule.
In any case, I love the game!

Seems to offer really many possible options to player. Lots of thinking about which card I should choose, which card is too good for the opponent to allow him/her take it, how to use available cards to score points. The interaction is not direct, but it exists nevertheless, quite enough for me. The game reminds me Race for the Galaxy somehow, though on paper it's very different. 

In the prototype version some cards seem very strong (too strong), but that's what testing is all about - to find them and weaken a bit so they can't decide about the result alone. I have strong faith that Ignacy will manage to playtest the game perfectly before publishing and that 51 State will be another big hit from Portal this year (after Neuroshima Hex and Stronghold).

Initial Rating: 7.5 (December 2011)

This was presented to me as the game that was going to replace RFTG!  That was unfortunate because:  1. I don’t subscribe to the philosophy that one game replaces another (there are very few exceptions). 2. It made my expectation very high as I love RFTG. Sadly, this game didn’t met those expectations. 

Love the theme; I really like the Neurohima Hex world. Also love when cards can be used for different purposes. I like that each player begins with different a power. Love that can be combined with The New Era and Winter (I have not played either of those games).

I dislike how the box is used as a score track (I always leave my boxes home and bring my deck cards with me in deck boxes), the icons aren’t the best, the art is ok and I haven’t had much fun playing this, still the designer credentials and the theme make me want to try the game again soon as I feel there is a lot of potential in 51st State.

The rules for this game are so badly written, I can hardly call it a game. The symbology is also poor, but that is a minor gripe compared to the rule book.

I think our first game took 2-3 hours, mostly trying to figure out the rules. The game doesn't seem to introduce anything new, that hasn't been seen in better games, but it still seemed interesting to me.

If this game was better presented, I could see it doing well, but I could never get anyone to replay it, so that was that. It was not a good $5 investment.

Wow. I love post Nuclear war period. Anything can happen from zombies to dinosaurs and aliens and, well you get the idea.

Choose one of four different factions and try to rebuild your world. Each card has three different options on them. A temporay effect (Red), a permanent effect (blue) and a building effect (brown). Each effect has a range assocaited with using the card. Red and Brown go behind your base card. Brown goes out to your small city. Don't forget you also have Leaders helping out. Each of the four factions are different with their permanet cards that help out in setting up your city. First to 30 victory points is the winner.

I have tried to teach this game but few have grasped it. I love it, so I play solo exclusively. Plenty of options, not too much interaction with other players, you can use their open factories if you have any extra workers. Lots of strategy once you fully grasp this fun game.

This game has been compared to Race for the Galaxy. Play 51st State, to me it is simplier, quicker and better. I am not a RFTG fan at all. Can't wait for the next expanision of 51st State. 

Easy set up, Easy clean up.

Pales compared with its peers. The combo-building card games work when they are fast. 51st state has lots of tedious accounting with fiddly little resource tokens, which can't even be optimized out due to the you go-I go system.

RATING: 5
I can see how some would like 51st State.  I don't really care for the theme, but I can see how some would.  Once you get to know the cards it seems like you could get into the game.

That said, there are some serious strikes against the game that make me think that I will probably not be playing it too much (or ever) in the future.

First, it is too long for what it is.  It really needs to be streamlined.  The main problem is all the little tokens that you have to keep taking from and returning to the storage.  Games like Race for the Galaxy and 7 Wonders have come up with great ways to simplify the collection/production/consumption of goods and handling all the little chits is too annoying.

Second, the rule book is absolutely horrible.  These days a game needs to make a great first impression in order to warrant enough plays to really shine.  It's hard to have a great first play with rules that are so difficult to use.

I really enjoy the civilization building but within a short period of time. The distance mechanic makes this game seem very thematic and when we tend to play we always have a joke or two about Baby Swift being removed by THE HAMMER.

Slick game, but the complaints I do have are:

The lack of a victory tracker besides the bottom of the board game box.

The point counters are reversible so there is a constant chance fo someone flipping their victory counters to the opposite side.

It is interesting that every place card can be used in three ways. However, actions during the turn are quite limited, so there are not that many possibilities. At least at game start. Pretty fiddly game with not that clear rules.

Įdomu tai, kad kiekviena vietovės korta gali būti naudojama trimis būdais. Tiesa, per ėjimą galima padaryti pakankamai mažai, taigi galimybės iš tiesų nėra tokios jau plačios. Bent jau žaidimo pradžioje. Gana painus žaidimas ir gana painiai parašytos taisyklės.

I played this a couple of times and the game is captivating.  However, I feel that the leaders are too strong and whoever has more of them will win the game.  This stopped me from buying the game.  I know the designer claims that the leaders are balanced after 100s of play tests, but it certainly doesn't feel like that to me.

Partially played because the (German) rules are totally messed up and faulty, too. It seems interesting enough to warrant keeping it until I get to play it for real.
Update: Played a full game now - prompty got at least one important rule wrong which probably made it longer than it should be. Still like it but those rules, man!

RATING: 7
A bit similar to Race for the Galaxy. The interaction is created through drafting cards at the beginning of each turn. After that players can pretty much ignore each other and do what they can with their cards and resources. Symbolism is a lot clearer than in RftG and you achieve understanding of the game a lot faster.

Players: 2-4 (6 with the 2 expansions)
Time: 90 minutes
In a post-apocalyptic setting, each person plays the part of a powerful organization as they attempt to re-build a powerful civilization that can control a ruined United States. This game involves resource management, worker placement, and deck building aspects. The goal is to create the best system and earn victory points along the way. Player interaction is minimal, but the game can be quite rewarding.

Unnecessary complex drafting rules. One of the worst iconography I've ever seen and the cards are not explained in the rulebook. This game has potential, but it is tanked by bad design decisions, the Master Set is probably a very good version of game.

I am now wondering if the idea was to make a game with more icons than RftG.. 

After 3 games I have to say that this game is reasonable, enjoyable, but its never going to be one that I would play so often that it will take over from RftG or Warhammer invasion. It lacks enough card variety to make it interesting enough too play more often. Each new game is just too similar to the previous one.

Trade agreed.

I was really rather bored by this efficiency exercise. There were a few interesting decision to be made at the beginning of the game, but as it progressed the decision felt less important.

This game is similar to San Juan and race for the galaxy.

Now what I like better about this game is that there are now "guessing what your opponent is going to do" like in race for the galaxy.

There is also a few interesting concepts like using cards to increase your income every turn or get a lot of resources now. The problem is that the resources does not stay from turn to turn, and there is no power up that allows you to do that. 

I also liked the idea that you could replace cards in play with other cards like if they were upgrades.

Still, there are many things which I do not like about this game. First I want to mention that we made an error while playing, we did not give 1 extra card at the beginning of the turn, so we draw 2 cards instead of 3 cards per turn.

Which had the consequence of making the game progress very slow. With more cards, it might have run a bit faster, but I hardly beleive the time 40-80 min time on the box. We played at least for 1-1/2 hour, 3 player game and players had between 11 and 20 points. (30 is required to win). So we ended the game now.

At the beginning of the turn, you draw cards by drafting them from the table. I do not like that mechanic because it makes the game longer for no reasons. If you really want player to choose their cards, give 5 cards to each player and make them keep 3 cards. It would run much faster this way.

Each cards has a special ability which is being expressed in icons. I understand that using icons makes the game language independent, but it's sometimes better just to read text when you want to understand a special ability. So I suggest they use both.

There are 3 ways to use a cards and since each of these ways give different variable stuff, it becomes very confusing to analyze and remember how these cards can be used. For example, the ressource given from pillage and cooperation should have been the same (ex: 1 fuel each turn, or 3 fuel now). This way, it's easier to remember which card does what. 

Players play one action after another instead of all your actions at once. By doing this, it requires the need of resource token to keep track of what you did. But it also slowdown the game because doing 1 action at a time, makes you forget what you wanted to do and it makes the game take more time.

The resource tokens are annoying to manage. You must collect them at the beginning of the turn, and you must discard them at the end of the turn. It's an anoying process that takes a lot of time. If people could play all their actions on their turn, there might be no need to do all this bookmarking.

So yes, there are a few cool idea that add up to other similar games if you are looking for inspiration for a game of your own. So it's interesting to see how they decided to used their cards compared to San Juan and Race for the galaxy. But I don't think I would play again this game.

Final note, has it has been discussed with a other players, if you play a game where you must know all the cards in the deck to play efficiently, then this is very bad. This is the kind of syndrome that card games like this ones seems to have.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First impression after one play is quite positive.  Knocks against the game would be the iconography which isn't always intuitive (I think RftG does it better and considering the hub-bub about RftG, I'm not sure what that says about this game!) and the instructions which aren't all that well written.  However, the gameplay and multiple use of cards in this game (think one time larger bonus, consistent beginning of turn bonus, or production bonuses) does add quite a bit of decision making to the game.  I also appreciate that each player has different starting abilities that encourage each faction to pursue different strategies.  I will say that the first couple plays of this game could be a bit obtuse and confusing - this is not an easy game to play out of the box.

There are differences between this and Imperial Settlers but I don't feel the need to have both and prefer IS.

An interesting game with high replay value, but incredibly annoying graphical design. Things are regularly not in places you look for them, the rulebook is a mess (to put it nicely) and the iconography drifts into dadaistic realms from time to time. These make it hard to get initial grips, but overcoming them is well worth it.

I was worried at first that this was going to be similar to Race for the Galaxy, with a bunch of impenetrable cards and no (sorry, "subtle") interaction. While the influence of the other players is still fairly low, I find this to be a surprisingly easy to grasp game that plays pretty fast and furious. Update: I liked 51st State, but the Re-implementation as [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/96007/the-new-era]The New Era[/url] is just so much better (unless you hate direct interaction.)

I didn't like it very much. Note well - this is not me saying it's not a good game, this is me saying it's not my kind of game.

It's a tableau building game and probably the best way I could describe it is that it's RftG meets Neuroshima Hex (which is ostensibly the setting for 51st State).

At the start of your turn you draft cards. Cards have three aspects - a blue aspect which is a bar along one end of the card, a red one along the other, and a building in the centre. Each card has a point value assigned to it, say 3.

Each player has three sets of cards that contribute to the three colours - red are conquests, blue are cooperatives, and the buildings are incorporations. The number is meant to be a range, but what the units of range are is never clearly defined.

If you get a card by conquest, you tuck it under your home card with the red stripe showing. This will have something on it, say three stars which are victory points. You can cash this in at the start of the production round to take three VP and then you throw the card away.

If you take a card by cooperation, you tuck the card under your home card with the blue stripe showing. Whatever's on the stripe is something that you get every prodution turn, say a unit of fuel.

The incorporations do a variety of things, usually related to producing units of goods you'll need to activate your cards for conquest, cooperation, or incorporation. I played the mutants and conquest required 1 weapon to get 3 conquest points, my home card produced one weapon every turn, so that's easy. My incorporation required two resources (not important what they were), and so I had to figure out ways to get them.

You can use other people's incorporations to get resources by using one of the three people you get every production turn, and the nifty thing here is you are paying the other player that person token to use their widget factory and then they get to use that person themselves.

Some incorporation cards can only be used by you and the icon on the card will show that. Another interesting twist is that some cards generate VP if you feed them the right resources, but they can only produce three times before they're depleted at which point you'll need to upgrade them to something else.

Whatever resources you produce on any given turn must be used on that turn. Anything leftover gets tossed.

I'm not covering all the cards and interplays here. There are also leader cards that confer certain benefits.

The iconography takes some getting used to, but for whatever reason it clicked with me pretty quickly, unlike RftG.

My quick verdict based on one late evening play at BGG.Con is that it's well designed, it's thematic, and it's not my kind of game.

While some would compare this to RftG, the only points in common are the wealth of symbols to learn the meaning of, and decipher the best decisions to make with the actions available.

So here we have a draft-based, tableau-building, worker-placement, resource management game about a post-apocalyptic future. Don't even think of trying this bad boy until you've played multiple rounds of Race for The Galaxy, Agricola, and Dominant Species, & even then the austere rulebook, fiddly tokens, and endless variety of inscrutable icons might well fry your brain to mush. Those who persevere at mastering the game's wildly diverse mechanics will discover a game with predictable flaws - one can easily lose track of the theme, and small errors at rule interpretation have the capacity to sabotage a first play-though. 

That having been said, with all this stuff to think about tactical decision-making in the game can be quite exciting, and it gets extra points for stylish card art. Experienced Eurogamers who are willing to drink about four cups of coffee in a single evening might well relish the challenge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
With only 2 or 3 players, it's a little like "multi-player solitaire." Once all four players are involved, things get kind of interesting and the worker economy seems to flourish.  I can't recommend it for less than 4.

The primary emphasis on the game is on resource management and building an economy.  There's also an element of choice, since each card can be used in two different ways for a permanent gain or one separate way for a larger temporary boost.  But the basic idea is to collect resources somehow to make production facilities to produce resources, and channel those into action cards than can turn them into victory points.  There's a bit more to it, but that's at the core of it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I played the new version of this game.  You acquire guns, gasoline and other items to obtain build tokens which in turn allow you to build buildings that grant special abilities.  Buildings are three types, production, one time production or a special ability or VP scoring buildings.  You are racing to 25 VP's.  Each faction plays a little differently in this post-apocolyptic world.  

I liked this game but I was not that keen on the theme.  I tend to not like post apocalyptic games, but it was ok.  I do prefer Imperial Settlers but that is mainly due to the theme, this game plays almost identically to Imperial Settlers.

A very good tableau game, maybe in the running with Glory to Rome and Innovation.  It is a bit fiddly with all the tokens and iconography and takes over an hour to play so far.

Many cons:
1. Poor graphic design makes this game much more difficult to learn than Race for the Galaxy. The problem is esp evident for the 'bonus card draw' type of cards.
2. Highly variable playtime and susceptible to AP.
3. Lack of interaction between players.
4. Poor rules organisation. I need frequent recheck the rules during our first play still can't sure I've played the game completely correct!
5. Overproduced and overpriced.
Few pros:
1. Excellent graphics (not graphic design)
2. Excellent card drafting mechanism makes each game different.
The rating is based on 1 play with 3 players, 2 very experienced and are close friend of mine. May go up/ down depends whether I have another chance to play it again. So many good games in 2010...
Edited on 2/10/2011:
Played the 3rd time, all 3 (me included) have played the game before. The experience this time is much better as we started to figure out how to generate VPs despite randomly putting cards on the table. This does not change my comments above: This game is still a multiplayer solitaire. But this is a very good one ONCE YOU CAN GET THROUGH THE ULTRA-BAD WRITTEN RULEBOOK.
Rating up to 7.

No, no, no, for God's sake NO! It's not a game, it's pure torture.

Just don't draw a leader – and the game gets pointless and all you can do is kiss your opponent's ass and call him grandma.

While I love games, I’m not particularly fond of puzzles, and I think that this is what prevents me from enjoying 51st State as much as it might merit. To clarify what I’m talking about, a puzzle is something purely tactical with a single optimum solution and something that works about as well as a solitary venture.

51st state feels to me like four or five rounds of a rather complicated puzzle: I’m presented with my cards and resources and now have to squeeze out as many victory points as possible. While the game arguably also provides room for strategy and interaction, the aspects that would make it more game- and less puzzle-like, I think that they are only of negligible importance:

Any strategic considerations are hampered by the fact that a) the major part of the cards I’ll get in the coming rounds is mostly random and completely unknown beforehand and b) there is no way at all to speed up or slow down the game, so considerations of rush vs. careful build-up are a waste of time.

Interaction consists of granting workers to other players and the card selection during the lookout phase of the game. The potential of interesting decisions along the lines of optimal card for my VP machine vs. good card that is totally golden for my opponent’s VP machine is squandered, because most of the time the value of cards is too varied for different setups, i.e. your totally golden card is mediocre crap for me, so taking it would be crippling for the two of us and paint a big contended grin on the other players’ faces.

To make this puzzle even more disappointing, it is seriously imbalanced due to the random starting hands - getting a good fit of these cards to your faction’s abilities will give you a head-start that might be overcome by horrendous luck later on, but not by any brilliant plan on behalf of the other players. This leaves you with a 90 min heavily luck-driven puzzle with a serious entry hurdle, and a world that has been blessed with Race for the Galaxy has no need for something like this.

Which is a damn shame, because the disconnect of this harsh verdict and my rating of 6 is testament to the qualities of the design: the different possibilites of using a card (plunder, build or contract) are a brilliant idea, and the use of workers in neighbouring factories is also a good way to spice things up. Sadly, the good design apparently did not get the development it deserved, and the puzzle is only a slight shadow of the game it could have been.

It seemed a bit long for our learning game (about 2.5 hours), but I am sure that would be improved by experience. 

Even though the draft mitigates the luck factors a bit, I found myself starved for cards that would allow me to do something besides build for the middle section of the game.  I am not sure how big of a problem that really is, but I found it frustrating.

Game gives many choices and paths to victory, but

I am comparing the game to Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome. 51st is simply worse. In RftG and GtR you get possibilities to find the card that you are missing the most. Here - the choice is too limited.

I would like to see some expansion to get much more interaction between players.

Pretty interesting tableau building game. I really like building your own engine within a game and racing other players for victory points. Good post-apocalyptic theme. I hear that the game is similar to Race for the Galaxy and Imperial Settlers...I much prefer this game's theme to the others however.

A luckfest with an atrocious rulebook.  Also, the game compensates for the first player advantage by giving them an extra card to choose from... then first player becomes runaway leader from turn one while everyone else gets to anxiously await the inevitable end.

Played a few partial 2-player games and some solo games.  I like the theme a lot, but the components are pretty terrible though, making the game much harder to manipulate that it should be.  The tokens in particular are really small and irritating to move around.  

Ultimately though, this is an engine building with some clever ideas, but it's far too intricate and mentally taxing for what I got out of it.  The iconography just didn't click with me at all to make much headway through the game.  I also feel like the rules are needlessly complicated and a complete re-write could make the game simplier to understand.

As it is, 51st State is a fine VP engine building card game, with quite a few different ways to win. You can play aggressively, but depending on the cards drawn; opportunistically, but risking a wonky, underperforming state; or with precise planning, at the cost of speed. 
My main beefs are that the accounting of resources could be a bit more streamlined, the factions are rather samey, I don't feel real difference between them, and there's the painfully missed opportunity of MtG style direct conflict, which should be a requirement in a game in Neuroshima, one would think.
All in all, it's an enjoyable game with a great theme, but nothing really new. Looking forward to the expansion, to make it a great game.
---
Update: You see, I still don't mind having 51st State. We played the last penny out of it, and more, but the release of [gameid=96007] made it obsolete, and look like a beta version of the real deal. You can safely skip this one, and head straight to New Era.

After 10 games, some with the play testers of this game , i think it's a crappy game and won't suggest it to anyone.
The theme is really cool, but all the other think are really bad especially the balance of the cards and fractions.
Some card are overpowered for it's small cost and other are crappy for a great cost.
I think the author want to quickly publish the game. 
but that's not all things in the box there are not enough tokens.
The draft is extremely random if you are the first player you are the guy in other case you suck all the way, after this the pts track is written on the box , and also there are a lot of mistakes in the rule book
So i give this game for the first time a 4, now a 3.

At its core, 51st State is a resource allocation game kind of like Through The Ages. Every turn you get some resources, and you use them to play more cards that will give you more resources or spend them using your set of special powers to gain victory points. It's "economic snowball" and "efficiency engine" through and through; keys to winning are making the best use of your scarce resources and making them as "less scarce" as you can as fast as you can. The catch is that there is an added dilemma that produces the "tens of decisions" promised; namely, when choosing to increase your resources [build your "engine"], you must choose between "more right now", "less but more often", or "more potential and more points but more work". What if the "Mineral Deposits" card in TTA was also the "Iron" card and was also the "Transcontinental Railroad" card? How would you choose which power to use if they were mutually exclusive and could never be combined? This is the central problem that 51st State offers. TTA offers a bit of these "now or later" / "time value of money" trade-offs, but much less directly because you can always "do both". 51st State asks you to actively choose whether you want a boom-and-bust economy, a lean consistent production model, or a fully integrated supply chain with very high overhead.

The way it works is that there are three ways to "pay for" a card, three "powers" on each card, and three ways to use a card. There is a "red" power which takes red currency to put into play; if you choose this option, you will be able to use the card to get a one-time influx of a lot of resources. There is a "blue" power which takes blue currency to put into play; if you choose this option, you will get much lower resource output, but you will get it every turn instead of as a one-shot deal. There is a "white" power which takes white currency to put into play; if you choose this option, the card will be worth a point [red and blue aren't] and might generate some each-turn income, but usually will require you to commit extra resources in a "x for y" conversion function scenario to gain the benefits [points or further resources] of the card. Individually, these functions are present in nearly all resource-type games [influx vs income; cash vs points; etc], but it is the combination of all three on each card that makes this game tick, and makes it feel original. Because you need three different currencies [essentially a refined resource, in most cases] to use each of the three different card options, the way you set up your "engine" will determine to a pretty large extent the way your income model and cash/resource-to-points model will work. Rather than just casually building up along a different specialization track at approximately the same pace, you might be moving in bumps and spurts while another player is gradually ramping up efficiency.

A recent review of 51st State describes the game as "actually a fairly stock-standard {resource}--->{engine}--->{VPs & more resources} style tableau game where the focus is very production-oriented and very solitaire in nature." This is accurate, but it kind of misses the point. "{engine}" is a fill-in-the-blank here, and it could theoretically be the engine of anything from a lawnmower to a diesel truck to a coal-fired steam engine. No one's going to intentionally play TTA relying on "Mineral Deposits" and "Rich Land" to make up for poor resource productivity [though they might be forced to do so as a result of poor planning]; I could see someone playing 51st State with the intention of looting and pillaging as many high-value one-time gains as possible instead of focusing on marginal gains to each-turn income. In fact, this is probably the ideal strategy for some of the game's asymmetric starting positions. Maybe it's just that short-term-vs-long-term is one of my favorite quandaries in gaming, but this strikes me as a much more interesting and multi-faceted game system than "See who can stay ahead on the marginal growth curve". If nothing else, it doesn't seem to really have been tried before in this particular manner. I've certainly never seen a mechanism very much like it. Race has "cards as resources" vs "cards as engine", but not in the overlapping "cards as quick firecracker engine," "cards as slow consistent engine," "cards as powerful resource-hungry engine" tradeoff trifecta used here.

Interesting, thematic Engine builder. Wish it had more factions in it to give it greater replayability. I would consider playing the master set, but the base game it fun, if not dark. The expansion that adds attacking is monumentally stupid. It makes the game three times as long as you just flatten your opponents out of spite and they have to start their engines again. Not even fun a little bit.

RATING: 3
In short 51st state feels more of a complex resource grind system with pasted on theme than a game. This game falls into a category of games (resource grind) that I personally dislike very much. Still... these games are fairly popular among players so you may enjoy it.

Heavy resource management (the only thing in this game), little or no player interaction, fairly long game for what it is, lots of different symbols that you have to know and there is no reference cards to help you.

Do not think this has anything to do with Neuroshima hex, totally different game with the same theme and universe. I love Neuroshima hex but this is something else.

Pros:
- Cool art and theme, but feels pasted on
- Mechanically seems to work well

Cons:
- Not my cup of tea, feels more work than 8 hours in the office, stress levels are spiking, not fun.
- The whole game is about getting more resources to get more resources to get more resources to get more resources to ...
- Very difficult to teach and learn.
- Some rules seem more complex than they need to be, fiddly as hell
- Component quality is mediocre at best. Rule book is made from very thin paper and tokens plus the box are low quality too.

Meh. The fantastic theme does little to compensate for the appalling quality of the VAST array of cardboard counters required to play this game.

Seriously, the inability to pick up these damn counters without claws or magnets is infuriating, considering how MUCH of the game is repetitive counter-cycling.

Basically, this is just Race for the Galaxy without the elegance of their card-based resource system.

I really don't see the gameplay here... sorry.

Even if this game was published well before Imperial Settlers, I played the later first.

I love engine building and multipurpose cards games and this is one that will get you totally immersed from the moment you draw your first cards to the very end.

The core idea and mechanics are those from Imperial Settlers, but all the cards are common and you are not forced into any strategy preset by your player powers. You still have player powers that will affect your gameplay in a sensible way, but you have much more freedom.

I also found it to be deeper than Imperial Stettlers, something I certainly appreciate, it offers many paths to victory and plenty of meaty decisions (to the point of becoming a danger in the last turn for AP prone players). 

Now, on the minus side (besides a poor manual):
-> Poor manual
-> The iconography is complicated and not very intuitive
-> Multiplayer solitary

Way too long and slow.

The rulebook is very ambiguous on several essential issues, including timing and what certain card powers specifically do.

Edit3:
After 9 games there is nothing new to explore. It wears out very quickly. Sold.

Edit2:
In 4 player game some little interaction spoted... 

Games with more then two players have a serious problem with tokens - definetly not enough. And you HAVE to made extra ones by yourself (or buy another copy of 51st State) because they are necessary to play. EDIT: Publisher will probably send extra ones in near future.

---

Edit1:
After another two games rating rises to 7! Some rules I played wrong because of BAD written rulebook!
Maybe it isn't the best card game but it is enough interesting to play it more. 

---

Rating after one play: 6.5

Many people compare this to Rftg. Both games have nothing similar (except size of the box :)

Some initial thoughts:
- decision tree don't even come close to rftg. More tactical and more flat. Yes, there are a lot of combinations between cards but if you think more about them (watch out for AP factor) there are one or two real decision(s) each turn. Others are crap or strongly based on luck of the draw;
- definiction of multiplayer solitaire. Almost no interaction! That one in Race is HUGE compare to this. No joke;
- quite long for what it is. Our first game took us 1h40 min. I know that with more plays game lengh should be shorter but for exemple, again, first play of rftg took 1h. (Now one game takes max 30-40 minutes with all expansions);
- quite fiddly;
- terrible written rulebook;
- not enough tokens even for two players.

After one play I'm a little disappointed. It isn't a bad game. Not at all. But it doesn't have that "something", that you can say "wow, what a smart card game!". It isn't in a class with Dominion or Race for sure.

Of course this opinion is after one play so I have time to change my mind :) I need more plays.

Getting started with all the iconography is a bit tricky but once you get it down the game is very smooth and balanced. I am not sure which is easier to learn RFTG or 51st. I would suggest when teaching new players to play of few dummy rounds essentially showing them how to interact with each card through the 3 types of contact.

Whoa !! Super Cool Tableau-Building, Post-Apocalyptic, Resource and Hand Management Card Game by Ignacy Trzewiczek. Cards have multiple uses. Lots of decisions. Very tactical with some strategy. Puzzle-y feel. Love at first play. The game crawls the first couple rounds, but accelerates to a blazing finish.

NOT A GATEWAY GAME !! Learning curve. Lots of icons. Complex-ish rulebook.

This Polish gamer (me) understands and loves this fiddly slow building AWESOME game from Poland !!

Better with Winter, but is fantastic on it's own. Bits could be bigger and more abundant.

RATING: 8
"Low-conflict engine-building tableau card game, with resources that perish after each round. It is quite deep. A few awkward graphic design choices make it needlessly hard to learn and play. In terms of resource planning, it's more like Caylus than San Juan."

What I like:
- Clever multiple use of cards
- The only attacks are pretty expensive
- Quick turns (each player takes one action)
- Challenging resource management (perishable goods!)
- Nice little asymmetry with faction abilities
- Most of the icons are clear and helpful (but some aren't)
- Super quick setup
- Official solo variant seems reasonably fun
- The Toy Vault edition rulebook is pretty good
- Reasonable box size

What I don't like:
- Some of the graphical design choices are poor
- Lots of little chits (which are a bit thin)
- Leaders seem a bit under-developed (and can safely be left out as a houserule)

I would put the weight around 2.9, a bit lower than BGG voters.

I really like the idea of this game. Is not nearly as good and elegant as Race for the Galaxy, but I can see why people compare it a lot. The tokens are really fiddly though and that is one major critique point I got. It's really cumbersome to use them and players have to slide them over the table which will wear them down very quickly. I might buy tokens for this.... overall, a good game experience though.

- Fiddly rules, not easily explained but once the rules are down, it all makes sense and game-play should be really fast.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play: Another one of those games where you should play with others who have the same knowledge of the cards as getting combinations is key. By using your resources you are able to play down cards in various areas and produce either more resources or points. Each faction has it's own strength and some cards are better for each faction but the main combinations are the same. An interesting game and if you like Race for the Galaxy, this would be right up your alley with a more apocalyptic theme.

This is a CCG-like card game in that it features a deck with mostly different cards, each of which has a unique set of abilities.  There are three ways to play these cards: for an large immediate resource benefit, for a small every-turn benefit, or for a card text ability.  However, to play a card in a certain way, you need to have enough "power" in that type of takeover.  Basically you're trying to generate resources to churn through your point engine, but these point engine cards will expire after three uses.  It has some interaction, but that didn't seem too significant.  The game was fun, and reminded me a little of Race for the Galaxy, but with a different feel.

Comment: This game is fantastic, but really rough around the edges. With each subsequent expansion, this game has gotten better and better. My biggest complaint is the chits. Paper thin, hard to pick up and super tiny. I also don't like that you use the back of the box for scoring and that the rulebook isn't very clear. Now I love this game, but I will only play it with the Winter expansion. On it's own, a 7. With the Winter expansion, a 9.

Optimal Player Count: 3 > 2 > 4 > 5

I really wouldn't play this game with more than 3 unless they were all experienced. I think 3 is the sweet spot, but 2 works REALLY well.

Essen '10. First attempt at playing: the rules for this one are better than those for Stronghold, but they are still a hopeless mess if you're trying to find something. Some things seem to be missing from the rules, hopefully there are some answers in the forums here. Disregarding that, the few turns we had time for gave me the impression that it is a nice game, with some interesting options. Needs another (full) play, which I find I am looking forward to. 

Played again, liked it even more. I'm still not sure I really get it, but it's a lot of fun to play.

RATING: 7.5
Very nice game. A step up from Dominion and the likes for those who like a little work required in their games. Downside: average instructions, a little hard for casual gamers to grasp - hence not always easy to find players. Still, we need more games like this one in the game world.

The problem with this game is that its instructions are a broken English translation.  It's fun once you can re-translate the instructions, but you need to know the rules inside and out because if another player is confused about any one mechanic, they generally will not be able to check the rule book/understand them when they do so.

At least that's been my continued experience with the game, which is why it usually only comes out when I'm gaming with people who were around when the re-translations and "play-testing" happened.

We gave it a honest go. While it's definitely not a bad game, it's somewhat lacking. It has a solitairy feel to it and it's deprived of any excitement. Just draw your cards, compare which are better for your little engine, play them, gather points, rince-repeat. All in all, it felt very prone to unlucky draws - at least I think I won a handful of games, because my opponent didn't have the opportunity to catch me on the scoring track.

Also it's very taxing for newcomers. If you can't grasp all the card relations, you will be doomed to failure. Take that as you will. 
Sold it. While I didn't mind playing it - still, it was a nice exercise in optimization - my wife very much did. (The theme didn't help.)

Good game that needs some minor balance adjustments (houseruling 1 VP for Redevelopment/Leader Change is highly recomended). The more people, the better.

Also, if you are a fan of Race for the Galaxy and want something lighter (and less frightening) that works with your friends, this is a good choice. It has enabled me to successfully prepare some "medium-gamer" friends for RftG.

RATING: N/A
Still early on in assessing this game, but I do like the puzzle-like aspects of putting together your point-engines with the available resources you've put together.  I only wish the game could play in less time, since games tend to take longer for me than indicated on the box (or at least in the upper range of the time listed).  May be kind of long for what it is...  also, isn't the easiest game to teach but do not be too daunted - it was MUCH easier for me to teach this one to both my wife and a friend so far than Race for the Galaxy (to which it is often compared).

UPDATE:  Traded for Uncle Chestnut's Table Gype.  Liked the game but the extended play time it took my group just didn't fit with what I normally have available for a game of this type.

The rulebook is a bit of a mess and having symbols on the cards instead of text looks nice but makes it difficult to introduce new players. Overall, it's a fun game with tight mechanics that plays in a good amount of time, but it's hard to pull out for a casual game night. I think I've re-read the rulebook every time I've played. The mechanics just don't fully click with me.

To say that this game is a disaster is an understatement. It is a fiddly exercise in resource management that is marred by an abysmal rulebook. Be prepare to stare at cards, trying to figure out how they work, and most of the time only have to guess.

To add insult to injury, the arcane point accumulation system suffers from so many exceptions that it is night on impossible to teach. And while the iconography is not the most difficult to decipher, there are many cases where a new player simply CAN'T work out for himself how or when cards he's holding can be played.

... simply terrible.

RATING: N/A
We read the rules and started the 3 player game. But soon we gave up because we had so many rule questions that the rulebook did not answer, or at least we were  unable to find the information in it.
Maybe I give it a second chance, reading the rules on my own, check FAQ and runthrough videos to understand the game.

There is an official solo play rule from the designer.

It's a game about converting things in other things with a really cool post-nuclear theme.

Played about 60% of a game (for reasons of time) which I managed to 'win', which was strange because, while I dislike this kind of game (engine building+complex iconography), my two opponents enjoyed themselves. I probably succeeded because I went straight for the VP's and dare say that if we had seen it through to the end a more considered stategy might have won. But we were all groping our way along on a first play.

[b]Traded away 1 May 2012[/b]

11 solo plays currently.

The game style, to me, is similar to Race for the Galaxy or even Saint Petersburg in that you try to build an efficient economy through card play to maximize your score. Just as in the other games, there are different methods (strategies) you can use to achieve victory. There are different mechanics between all three, as well as complexity levels, but I think the style is nonetheless similar. I think there is a respectable amount of depth to this game. There are many, many card interactions and combinations. In addition, each of the four factions is slightly different, which results in a different playstyle for each. One will find it easier to negotite deals, another will find it easier to use conquest, another will have an easier time incorporating locations, etc.

What's appealing:
The theme is cool. The artwork is fabulous! That's not an adjective I use often. I love the art. You can play this game solo without much modification with a variant from the designer. It's a good way to understand the card combinations and gameplay.

What's unappealing:
The game play is a little fiddly strictly because of the way the counters are used. Not a big deal, but it is definately not as "elegant" as Race for the Galaxy or Saint Petersburg. I play solitaire games. This is not my favorite way to play a solitaire game. I'd rather it be akin to Race for the Galaxy in which there is a race or competition with an AI opponent. Here you just play to test card combos and best your high score.

The verdict:
I don't have much drive to play it solo. That may change. I don't forsee getting my wife to play this.

Good game though, wish I could play multiplayer or that there was a competitive solo variant.

RATING: 4
--May2011-- Definitely a preliminary rating (that I expect I'll continue to refine over the next 8-10 games.)  After a first play, it seems fiddlier than I expected, but is still quite amusing.  I'm on the cusp of buying-or-not.
--Sep2011-- After a couple more plays, I'm still not clear on the balance between the starting positions.  Nor have I come to an accomodation with the fiddliness.
--Aug2012-- In retrospect, it's fading in my estimation.  Some of that is _The New Era_ - with which I was rather unimpressed.

One of our favourite 2-player games. We do play with the variant where upgrading cards and leaders provides one point since it seems over-powering otherwise. Really enjoy the card management, though it takes a while to get used to the symbols and mechanics.

RATING: 8
I'm somthing of a fan of tactical card games, and 51st State is one of the better ones out there. Whilst not quite on the same level as RftG, the multiple-choices offered by each card is a nice mechanic. Thematically, the game appeals to me a lot, but I do recognise tthat the 'ameritashy' theme has done it no favours. I whole-heartedly agree with Paul Lister's suggestion that had this been a game about imperalism in the 1600s-1800s it would have sold much better.

I play this regularly - and reccomend it for a light but tactical game.

Addendum: Imperial Settlers is basically V2 of this one, and is a much improved, streamlined version of the same game.

A cool idea for a game, but there is not enough incentive to get agreements/spoils after the first few turns (unless they give victory points). The game is rather fiddly. The rules are poorly written, and there are many ambiguities in the rules. 

On the other hand, I like that cards can be used for 3 different things, and I like that you can't assemble your VP engine and just run it until the game ends. It makes you stop after 3 runs, which still rewards you for getting the engine going, but prevents the game from being decided by who gets a few cards that generate VP every turn first.

51st State had some cool mechanisms, but was very fiddly and very solitaire feeling to me. The card draft was convoluted and didn't seem like a major interaction, and the other interaction (playing workers on other players cards) didn't seem all that interactive either. So we were playing solitaire, kinda like 7 Wonders, only instead of me just throwing down all my moves I had to wait until my turn to do them one at a time - even the ones that didn't effect anybody else. That was tedious. How much different would it be if you just did all your stuff simultaneously? It only really matters for like 2 cards that steal resources from people.

[2012-04-28]
4-en játszottuk az első játékom alkalmával és 2,5 óra volt csak maga a játék és 1 óra hozzá a szabály. Ez elég brutális egy kártyás játéktól számomra. Valószínűsítem, hogy egy következő 4-es játék esetében is simán 1 óra fölé mennénk. A Neuroshima világában játszódó kártyás játék rögtön megjelenésekor felkeltette a figyelmem, főleg, hogy Race for the Galaxy-hoz volt rögtön hasonlítva. Nos a két játék lényegesen eltér. Itt a szerepek rögtön kiosztódnak, körönként fix kártyákhoz lehet jutni ingyen és a fő része a játéknak ezen kártyák legoptimálisabb felhasználásának kiszámolásáról szól. Azért hosszú, mert akár 10 lapról is dönteni kell egyenként, hogy mi a legjobb megoldás a felhasználására. Lehet rögtön kimeríteni, lehet körönként lerabolni és lehet megszállni. Ezen kívül a többi játékos lapjainak egy része is használható. Nagyon sok lehetőség adódik egy körben. Véleményem szerint sok is. Egy pár megoldást ha kivettek volna szerintem pörgősebb és számomra jobb játékot kaphattunk volna. A fő bajom a 51st State-el a vontatottságán, lassúságán kívül a nagy szerencseszerep. Persze a véletlenszerűen feljövő kártyák nagyon sok játékban megjelennek, de két a játékot azonosan jól ismerő esetében a kártyák feljövetele szerintem eldönti a partit. A játék erénye a szépen kidolgozott kártyák mellett, hogy 2-3-4 játékos mellett is teljesen jól működik, de máshogy is kel játszani a játékosszámtól függően. A játék esetében még az adott negatív szájízt, hogy mindenen spóroltak a kiadásakor. Pontozótábla a játékdoboz hátulján, a jelölőkből több is szűkös volt a parti során. Lehet, hogy az RFTG ikonográfiája kicsit bonyolultabb, de sokkal pörgősebb játék. Nem rossz az 51st State, de elsőre nem győzött meg, ettől függetlenül adok még neki majd esélyt.

RATING: 6.5
Decent engine building card game.  For all the theme it is really abstract though, with little real interaction.  You just draft some cards that other people might want in perhaps the most complicated drafting scenario I've ever played with (we had to refer to the rules every single time).  I didn't feel like I was doing anything particularly post apocalyptic.  The art was nice, but mostly it seemed like I was looking at heavy machinery.  Outside of perhaps the worst rulebook I've had the privilege of trying to read there was just a constant level of unneeded complication for how little you were actually doing.  

It's hard not to compare this to Race for the Galaxy.  They aren't the same game, but they scratch the same kind of itch and RftG does it 10 times simpler/faster/easier/thematically coherant/better.

Love it. I think I like it even better as the original without the expansion (believe it or not). Many believe this game is too fiddly for what it's worth, and I'll be the first to tell you that it is VERY fiddly. But I pimped mine out with chunkier, cool bits, like army men for the workers and cogs for the gears, etc - so the fiddlyness is actually cool now. Another gripe against this game (and well deserved) is that it is MPS (multiplayer solitaire). That is pretty true - can't deny it, but I love those kind of games as much as love in your face conflict games (battle lore, etc). All in all it's deep, has tons of hard decisions, good artwork, and is really just tons of fun. Great game.

RATING: 4
1 play, 4er.

It's a bit like [thing=28143]Race[/thing], but only a bit; and set in the [thing=21241]Neuroshima Hex[/thing] post-apocalyptic world. Players start with different configuration of powers, generating 3 different tokens in different amounts. Each game round starts with a unique draft, with later players having fewer cards from which to select (also, each player gets one random card). Most cards can be played in one of 3 ways, and generate either tokens or VP; some are usable only by you, others by anyone (once per turn, if they can pay you the access cost in tokens). After everyone has played their hand as they like, rotate start player and repeat. You play until someone reaches at least 30(?) VP; whoever has the most VP wins.

I don't care for the setting, think the card colors and layout are pretty garish, found the little tokens fiddly (and due to production problems, in short supply in my 4-player game), didn't like having the score track on the box bottom (lame!), and didn't think the iconography is as clear as in Race! There are some unique, interesting things here -- different faction abilities, the card draft, multiple ways to play cards, bonus VP when you upgrade a card. But the game just felt so random (where were _my_ stinking leaders?!), the faction differences seemed almost inconsequential (you had to play the cards you got), the card draft just slowed things down, and the game was simply not all that much fun! I would MUCH rather play Race, or Dominion, or Eminent Domain.

A card game in the family of Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome. 51st State may have an even steeper learning curve, with its different ways to play card and fiddly bits.

I liked it, but I also have the feeling that really everything is too scarce, both cards and resources. That give you a lot less freedom, which is a bit of a letdown. 

As a result, this will probably never see the table time that Race and GtR do.

It's a resource management game in a nutshell. Take it or leave it. Nevertheless the countless combinations of cards with its genuine design make this game pretty outstanding. There is one drawback though. The learning curve is quite steep because of game's complexity but if you give it a try the reward would be great.

This game has been compared to RftG many a time, and that just happens to be my most played game. But I wasn't to eager to just buy this blindly because
- I have a hard time imagining a game that will scratch the same itch and make me want to play it in stead of RftG
- The loud artwork and dark theme didn't make my hart run faster

So I finally played a friends copy last night.
This game is like RfgG in the way that
- You can build engines
- You can use the same card in multiple ways
That's about it. RftG lets you build engines that let you score big points or draw lots of cards. You have to adapt to the cards you get all the time while still building on your strategy. This game didn't offer that (at least in our game). You just try to make the most of each card you get (like in RftG) but I didn't feel like there was an overarching strategy. You build small engines that give you small games. You don't have 6es that score you big points. And you don't get to build things that let you do new things, just things that let you do the same thing more often or more efficient. So the game didn't feel as dynamic as RftG for me.

That being said, I do think 51st State is a good game. Maybe even a very good game, but only repeated play will tell us. I just think the RftG comparison is wrong and unjustified.

Initial rating: 7 (could go up drastically)

Hard to rate after one play as I have no idea how many rules we got right/completely wrong, but it seemed to make coherent sense so I'm optimistic.

There are so many possibilities with each card and added to the fact that you have to essentially plan your next turn during this one, it is entirely possible that game could bog down massively with AP players, but with 2 playing pretty quickly, this worked well.

Update: On a second play, we didn't interact at all, just programmed our turns while the other player thought what they were going to do on their turn and waited to be told to start.

Most rules were right, based on a quick re-read of the rules and an intro video on the geek.

Rating down from 7 to 6.3.

Traded for £15 (which is what I paid for it).

RATING: 7
The game has a strong theme (for example you become points when you bring to a gas station... fuel). The mechanic is easy to learn. 

But...

You have some options, but usually you see fast that only one option is the best. 

The game is very luck dependend - when you don`t become the right cards, you can do nothing (there no explore or search like in RftG and no options to mix strategies). 

Leaders are ALWAYS a must have option. You play them for free, they gives 1 point (like other cards, but you must pay to play other cards), recources that you can hold for later and posibble 5 points. 

The 4 fractions should be different, but you must play not like your fraction, you must play like your cards. So you don`t feel the difference (unlike in Neuroshima Hex, where in a 2 player game every fraction has their own style).

The cards are similar, so every game has a similar feeling. After 3 games i won`t play more, but i will not play so many games like RftG, replaybility is not so high.

You can`t play the game for 4 players - there to less tokens! (Portal will relese a fix pack after Essen, but for now you have to less tokens).

The rulebook is not the best. You will not understand everything.

This is sort of a post-apocalyptic version of Race For the Galaxy.  As such, it has a bunch of icons.  Like, really a bunch of them.  And there are a bunch of counter types as well.  I like some of the other tableau-building card games for their simplicity, and this misses that mark.  I did give a bonus point for the chuckle I got from two of the four factions being Mutants and New Yorkers.

Finally got around to trying this out, having had it sat on a shelf for a year or so. Much to my surprise, it's a fantastic little game. Reminiscent of San Juan and Race for the Galaxy in mechanics, it adds a whole load of tokens to keep track of different resources, which sounds like it could be fiddly in theory, but actually works out pretty well.

Some players didn't like the uncertainty of when the ending was coming - I thought that worked quite well, which is odd as I usually dislike that uncertainty in games. It's just a shame that it seems to take us double the box time to play - par for the course for our group, but makes this game feel just a little too long.

RATING: 7
One of the first heavy engine-building card games I played after Race for the Galaxy. It was a brain melting experience and I loved every minute of it. Expansions made the game even better and while I really like it still the new Remastered edition proved to be much easier to teach and quicker to play. Therefore the old version won't hit the table anymore and other players are not really interested to play it. It shares the fate with RftG I mentioned above and while this gem will leave my collection it will forever have a special place in my gaming heart.

RATING: 4
Only played 2 player games so far. Interaction is low and there is a deal of time spent with counters and placing points. It is hard to choose your own path due to the limit of card flow. Most of the time you want to utilize your whole hand and find the best way to fit what parts you have been given with the parts you draw. In this essence, it's more of a puzzle. We usually take a decent amount of time after the production phase just to plan out the rest of the action phase with rare changes once we start going. I like the different ways you can use the cards but I'm not sure I like the limited drawing capability or the extreme clunkiness of keeping track of points and resources.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I want to like this game more than I do, because the rest of my group likes it, but I find it sort of tedious & hard to see what's on the cards from across the table so I can plan my turn better.

This is a neat game that would have benefitted from better production values. The pieces are too small, and there's probably too many choices during the worker phase. From what I have read, it seems "New Era", instead of being an expansion, is really 51st State 2.0 -- I'll need to check it out.

All that said, this is an enjoyable game. It's mostly multi-player solitair, but that's okay with me.

Ez a kártyajáték egy poszt-utópisztikus világba repít minket. 
Nálunk a harmadik alkalomtól vált igazán pörgővé a játékmenet, ekkor már nem voltak nyitott kérdések a szabályokkal kapcsolatban és ismertük a lehetőségeinket is. Innentől már kevesebb, mint 1 óra alatt lement egy parti. 
Az első 5-6 játéknál mindig tanultam valamit a nyerő stratégiával kapcsolatban. Miután az ember jobban kiismerte, már könnyebb a döntések optimalizálása, csökken a játék kihívása és vele együtt az újrajátszhatósági érték is. Ügyesen kitalált és élvezetes játék, még ha elsőre a szabály magyarázat kissé hosszú is.
ami tetszik:
+ a kidolgozott világ
+ a grafika
+ a döntési lehetőségek nagy száma
+ a jól használható ikonrendszer a kártyákon
+ minden pontnak jelentősége lehet a végén
+ előre kell gondolkodni
és ami nem:
- a szerencse szerepe néha nagyon felértékelődik
- a rutin megszerzése után nem jelent komoly kihívást a helyes döntés meghozatala
- kerülhetsz olyan helyzetbe, hogy a szerencsének köszönhetően nagyon korán esélytelenné válsz
- a szabálykönyv elég átgondolatlanul van felépítve
- vészesen kevés jelölő van a játékban

(notes after a solo run through).  I can see this will be tricky to teach as you need a reasonable understanding of what everything can do (or lots of crib sheets).  Gameplay was good, and I can see how enjoyment would increase with multiple plays.  It all hangs together very well (just don't forget the redevelop action!).  You need to take advantage of the cards you have to build a VP generating machine.  Looking forward to playing (if not teaching) this one again.

RATING: 4
[u]Update after 9 plays:[/u] Biggest disappointment of the year. Too many fiddly machinations led to moments where I said to myself [i]this is not why I game.[/i] Despite an attraction to the theme & multi-uses for each card, it just bogged down in maintenance. 

[u]First several games:[/u]
The theme really works well - I could do an AAR on this game that would sound like a grungy post-apocalypse story. Not with the specifics of Earth Reborn, but as a civ-building arc.

Nice differentiation in each of the 4 tribes.

Fiddly alert for those with such allergies. But it works - it's not a bog from my point of view.

I can't say this game is as pristine a game as RftG - which is such a tight design - but it is easier to get up & running and shares the race/synergy/multiple-paths joy of RftG. Less interaction due to RftG's excellent role selection process; so this is a solo tableau building engine game with some sharing of locations and interesting expansion opportunity. But a better theme integration imo, better differentiation in player strategy beyond the initial homeorld in RftG, and great solo-ability. This said from a guy who doesn't solo games.

There is a high need for a clearly written FAQ clarifying rules & interpretations. While the rules lack a certain grace - ie: exceptions & a curious use of the Universal Resource idea - the game is simpler than it seems & does internalize somewhere in the second play without need of play aides and such.

My rating is an early response; I could see it trending downward if the repalyability ceiling is low. The expansion may take this to that level though; it'll be interesting to see.

We love this game (2 player). Slightly similar feel to RFTG but there are more dimensions involved in 51st State necessitating more decisions and as such it is a more satisfying game. Great artwork and nice components.  We would be very interested in the sequel (New Era) but it introduces PVP - so won't be getting that. 
Have purchased Winter though!

Update: Played this again after 6 years - it's held up really well! Glad to have purchased Winter as the new Master Set increases pvp whereas 1st Ed with Winter is the way to go for us Care Bears! I like Winter, apart from adding more cards the Frozen City speeds up play. So many options however, it's still a bit of a brain burner. 
Good for 2 player and for solo (beat your highest score)

An interesting game - great engine building with a multi-use card system. However the exceptions and limits imposed by the rules, and the somewhat trite post-apocalyptic theme, make it less engaging than I want. Imperial Settlers was a massive improvement on the mechanisms presented here.

strongly disappointing.  the draft portion of the game is weak to begin with, is further trivialized by the random card draw afterward, and is the primary yet extremely minimal point of interaction in the game.   It is also the primary decision point of the game, however since your options are so limited, it is rarely an actual decision.

the rules could have been organized better as well, and there should have been a player mat or something for symbology, card/token special rule reminders, turn structure (number of cards available to draft, for instance), and possible actions.    But that's all surmountable,  the glaring gameplay issues were not.

I bought this as a set of additional cards for New Era, and I think it works great.

As a stand alone, I would skip it - to reason to buy this when New Era is clearly better.

Gran juego de realizar combos (una de mis mecánicas favoritas). Para mi el mejor juego de cartas después del Magic (aunque son temáticas y mecánicas completamente diferentes). Lo mehjor que tiene el juego es que a pesar de que hay que hacer combos para conseguir puntos, estos son finitos con lo cual hay que buscarse nuevos combos durante el desarrollo de la partida.
Lo peor de todo el diseño de los iconos de las cartas ya que cuesta aprendérselos en un un principio,pero tampoco es nada preocupante.

This is a clever design that borrows the "use the card in multiple ways" mechanism from a lot of strategic card games, but probably doesn't really compare as much to Race for the Galaxy as many of the comments and reviews are suggesting.  I guess the tableau thing is what's driving that comparison?  I don't know.  But this is a different animal entirely.

The game creates a lot of turn angst for such a simple idea, and it's satisfying to see the game develop.  It has a distinctive narrative where you can feel like there's a definite growth over the course of the game.  The rulebook is a disorganized mess, though, so if you have the opportunity to learn the game from someone else, DO SO.  We missed several rules, and misinterpreted a few that weren't all that clear.

The world you know no longer exists. There is no government. No army. No civilization. The United States has collapsed. And now, 30 years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control over the ruined country. Try to establish a new order. Try to control others. Create a new country, a new State: the 51st State.
\13\\13\
51st State is a card game in which players control one of the four powers (mutants, traders, New Yorkers and Appalachians) and try to build their very own new country. Players put new locations into the game, they hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills.
\13\\13\
Every card in 51st State can be put into play in three different ways. You can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your State so you can use its skill. One card, three possibilities. Lots of decisions and choices that matter.

RATING: 7
If we played correctly (and I think we did), there seem to be a few clunky bits. The factions don't seem well-balanced to me, though I'm not holding that against it since that's always a tough call after one play. It did seem to have a runaway leader problem; I was up 12 to 3 at one point, and it was never significantly closer after that even though it took an hour to play to conclusion. He was investing in infrastructure first, whereas I was just taking points as they came, and the infrastructure investment didn't really seem to make any difference. I only had a leader, 3 buildings and 1 production resource out at the end (burned everything else through rebuilding or spoils) and I was never really wanting for resources. I also suspect that I would be annoyed playing this with 3 or 4 given the way the face-up cards refill during the draft portion, similarly to how Ascension annoys me with more than 2.

Having said all of that, I still had fun with it, though a 7 rating might be too high (it's somewhere on the 6/7 line, and I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt). I'd try it again, though the main thing stopping me is that the guy I played with didn't like it and I dread the idea of having to teach this again. The iconography is functional once you get used to it, but it makes Race for the Galaxy look like Coloretto.

My wife and I have a TCG history before we got sucked into our boardgame addiction. So when we first came across this cardgame we both instantly fell in love with it. As newbies back than, it took us quiet some time and plays to fully grasp the rules and the iconography. But when we finally did, our love for this game grew with every confrontation. Carddrafting and building a stronghold between the ruins of an apocalyptic setting. To do so you get a zillion options to use your cards. Because you can use them in three ways. Together with some challenging restrictions, you're constantly looking for you're best options and interesting combo's. The lack of interaction doesn't really bother us, cause you're so focussed on building the perfect city.
It's a hard game to explain to new players (especially with all the different symbols), so we play this almost everytime with the two of us. And allthough I loose many, many, ... many times, lately my wife really has to give her all to stay Queen of 51st State.
This turned out to be -without a doubt- our number one cardgame ... and game overall. Together with the expansions I call it my 51st State saga and their's no doubt in my mind this will stay our # 1 for many years to come!
By the way, it's also responsable for my Portal Games addiction.

Combined with New Era

The game is a pain to explain, even though the base mechanics are fairly simple. Draft cards, use base abilities to play cards in one of 3 ways. The problem here are the icons, that aren't all that easy to get.
Second problem is the rulebook which doesn't do a very good job in teaching you the flow of the game. Still, I like this game. Maybe it's the setting, even though the theme doesn't feel that fused with the mechanics. Somehow something clicks. The way cards interact, you really have the impression of making your own place in the wastelands.
There's not much stealing, scavenging or lord humoungous in there but I don't really miss it :).

Is this a RftG killer? no idea, I just happen to like it better.

Wife is lukewarm on this game but I find it very interesting and fun. I love engine building games so it is right up my alley.  Fiddliness lowered rating.

Once you get the rules down, it's an okay game. It lacks the polish but shares design with RFTG. Production is iffy, as the cards aren't finished and the game comes with far too few counters. It does have some nice mechanics (scoring only 3 times, 3-tuck rule) but lacks staying power overall as other games do what it does but better. 

Bottom line: clunky.

As a big fan of post-apocalypse fiction, films, and games I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately it was a real disappointment. I felt particularly bad about not liking it because it was a birthday present from my wife who thought that I would love it. My main problem with 51st State is that the theme isn't really supported by the underlying mechanics. It's just another resource management game masquerading as a post-apocalypse game and a dull one at that. The game play is lacklustre; there is little meaningful player interaction; and it's abstract in a way that leaches all of the fun out of playing. It's a shame as it could have been a great game.

I prefer 51st State in solo mode, as a really nice and fast solitaire game.

a good card game, with lots of juicy theme, and good game play elements.  it has the problem of too many icons, that are not so easy to differentiate, but with a good cheat sheet, it is not too much of one.

oh man, I really like this card game!...the theme only holds so long as everyone is into it, but the game plays smoothly once everyone "knows" the icons, which aren't too hard to learn, my only complaint is how the endgame just slaps everyone in the face once someone realizes they have won or are about to win...

Theme really turns me on, shame theres no presence of it in game much. Game is bit too tight on scoring and lenghty, but can play it again. Liked to check some expansions.

I love the theme and find that it fits so well with the mechanisms of this game. However, the components could've been a lot better. Seriously, just get out a bunch of those meeples from that game of Carcassonne that you're no longer playing, and use them instead of the worker tokens.

You may also want to get some nice bits to replace the resource tokens, just some wooden or plastic cubes in 5 colors, or even glass beads would be an improvement. The same thing goes for the VP tokens. Another quibble about the tokens is that there's just not enough of them, not even for a 2-player game - you need the Fix Pack!

The worst offense though is Portal's rule book. It's definitely competing for the worst rules I've ever read, and I have read well over 1,000 rule books in my life! The Toy Vault rules are much better, but still lacking a much needed example of play. The FAQ here on BGG is a necessity to get how to really play the game.

However, all those negatives aside, the game itself is a blast! I really enjoy it. I'm very curious how they will expand the game. The four factions in the game each specialize in one of four areas of the game, meaning either new factions will double up, or entirely new mechanisms and/or card types will have to be introduced. Either way, I'm looking forward to it!

I rate 51st State a 10, but that is with The New Era rules, and the Winter expansion. Standalone 51st State would likely be an 8, The New Era 9, and Winter 10. I love the damn game!

I was about ready to throw in the towel after hearing the rules, but after a few turns the game clicked and I really started to enjoy it.  Like this much more than Race for the Galaxy.  Game became very tight near the end.

Fantastic post apocalyptic game, found it via reddit, bit too token heavy, but the card artwork is fantastic as is the gameplay.

really awesome, kind of a mix between 7 wonders and RFTG, with a tiny smidge of glory to rome in there.

After one play:  The game seems interesting, but the iconography puts Race for the Galaxy to shame it's so complicated and obtuse.  This is a situation where the cards would have been much better served with text in many instances, rather than using wholesale icons.  Five or seven icons is fine if they're repeated throughout...30 icons all with different meanings is annoying.

Penalize a full point for the icon based cards.  A good game otherwise.

Plenty of tactical and strategic choices combined with an excellent theme (and cool artwork) make for the kind of card game I enjoy the most. Feels well-tuned and balanced. The iconography is decent and the game, while difficult to grasp at first and tricky to teach, flows wonderfully. The main negative is the score track printed on the back of the box.

Own the 7 card promo expansion.

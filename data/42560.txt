RATING: 7
A fun game, but the full version is too long for what it is.  The card play back and forth is very fun, but can be very frustrating when it just boils down to a modified dice roll.  Asymmetric objectives makes it very interesting to play either side.

RATING: 5
A bit tedious gameplay (3 hours for a card game? give me a break...I'll go play upfront instead) considering that it all comes down to a single break test roll in the end. Wouldn't have minded so much if it wasn't that long, but it seems as grindy as the real battle (perhaps that was the point? 

I did hear that the solitaire rules for it are great, and may up the score at a later stage.

I bought this because I like [thing=57073][/thing] so much, but this one just doesn't live up to that, even if it came out first.

Thematically, the game is strong.  Playing it is a bore, though.  You do a whole lot of maneuvering for what amounts to "You roll 3 dice.  I roll 2.  See who gets the highest number among those dice."
Sound painless?  Well, repeat that about 15 times.  Yeah, that gets boring really quickly.
The components are sharp and the rulebook is well written.  There's just nothing there beyond it.  The best thing I got out of this was that it was my first Stalingrad game, so I was able to take what I learned from the chrome and get better games on the subject.

This was an easy game to learn, but brutal.  As I played it, each time, it made me realize that Stalingrad was a meat grinder and brutal for both sides.

Interesting spin on Stalingrad. It is a fairly easy game to learn and it plays with a quick pace. My girlfriend and I find it fun and it has prompted us to disscuss some of the historical facts and fiction of Stalingrad.

RATING: 7
Fast action and an emerging graphical presentation. I hope the author keeps on with the series after this and The Fires Of Midway. The system plays super smooth with Midway being the better game.

Different solo rule sets by the designer to play the German or Soviet side  are downloadable.

Milsims Special July 2010.

First impressions after struggling through a 2 hr game with constant rulebook referencing were still good. The intensity of the game increased. Better organisation and descriptions in rules would greatly assist, but once you are over the initial learning curve looks like it would become quite intuitive.

My regular opponent is not convinced on the system, particuarly how a intense battle comes down to a series of die rolls at the end...but I think it still has a  valid basis in probabilities. The more factors you can swing you're way, the more liklehood of success...a case of 'the victors make their own luck'.

RATING: 3
Plenty of good, innovative ideas, but it feels like they should have had some more time to mature. Although the mechanisms used don't particularly correspond to anything real (buckets!?), overall the game does feel like urban combat in Stalingrad - the race to the Volga, the grinding, incremental nature of the combat, german firepower superiority against russian mass; the only negative aspect for me in this case is that you never seem to run out of formations to throw into the fight. Visually speaking, the graphical design is kind of horrible.

There's potential in here, but it needs some rules update (or variants) to come through. First problem is that you spend some time playing cards and in the end it's all resolved by the throw of a few dice, and to top it off only the highest counts - one six wins over ten fives. Even more seriously, all that gameplay feels essentially useless, particularly for the soviets - you're fighting over one die (for the one with the most units), at best two (including the one for most formations), when often the soviets automatically get 3 or 4 just from defence. Coupled with a relatively long playtime (about 2 hours), it can be quite frustrating.

Finally gave up and traded it away.

I wanted to like this game.  Playing it first kept me from buying it.

The game play is pretty fun, but I am disappointed with the battle resolution.  You do all this fun card play and unit killing, but then in the end, it is just one die roll.

Read this review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/447552/the-heaven-of-stalingrad  I can pretty much echo every sentiment laid out here (thought so far I am slightly less impressed).  Especially the "ghoulish delight" bit.

update:  Not without it's innovations but not sure there was enough game in there to keep.  Ended up selling this one.

Involvement with this game is one of the biggest pleasures I've ever had in my 27 years of gaming (my first game was Panzer Leader in 1981!  What a GEEZER I've become!!!).  Steve is a genius and the game has so many facets of play that I still don't think I completely grasp all the possibilities even after hundreds of games watched / played etc.  I enjoy the dynamic graphics and the clever relationship between the pics on the cards and their function in the game.  It took me a dozen games before I stopped looking at the cards and focused on the game!  There's another 100 games coming before I feel like I've "mastered" it, but perhaps I never will, it'll just continue to be an ongoing experience of learning.  Highly recommended for both the fun gamer and the hard-core intellectual gamer.

RATING: 10
This game is amazingly fun and dynamic.  Love the intensity and speed, but there's a lot more strategy than at first meets the eye--an interesting pull between short term gains in individual battles and long term strategies that may take turns before you see the results of your labor.  This game has both a macro and a micro game, and the fact that they are both engaging is a sign of a well-thought design.

RATING: 9
UPDATE:  Rating up to a "9."  Game is tense, bloody and brutal.  Going to be the deep two-player game of choice for a long time.

Provisional rating.  Have played through a few solitaire passes and read the rules multiple times.  I SUSPECT that this will hit a "9" rating for me, based on my preferences in games.  Current provisional rating of 8.5.  Will be playing it within a week or so.  Will skip basic game, and jump right to Advanced.

THoS is brutal, rewards aggression, and yet asks that you balance your desire to win every battle with your ability to do so.  Intense game with tense decisions.

Minor rulebook editing (spelling and grammar) issues, but layout and rule delivery was very good.  Suggest owners print out the full-color rules from the website - more easily followed than the B&W interior pages of the included book.

The quality of cards and markers is high to good.  Mats seem to be less than durable, though not bad.  I like the graphic design choices that were made.

Display at Origins inspired me to buy, though I ran out of time in the dealer room and had to buy it online right after the convention.  Clash of Arms service was INCREDIBLE!

I want to see more games like this.

RATING: 3
A little conflicted ... it's a good-looking and functional game, and bits of it are quite evocative. But it also runs too long for what it is, and the combat system seems like a lot of smoke and not much fire. You do a whole mess of cardplay which then boils down the roll of a couple dice in the best case scenario (if the Soviets get more than about 3 dice, the German odds become so long as to be hardly worth considering). I think the final dice-off really needed to be more nuanced. The weird "roll the dice and then wipe everything out" seems way too coarse for the amount of work you put into it.

But, I dunno. Elements of the game seemed to have promise. It seemed like it might just be just a house rule or two away from being pretty good. But, games like that usually end up getting dropped from my collection first. And ultimately it does run pretty long for what it is; Blue Moon packs more game into a tenth of the playtime. It doesn't have cool Stalingrad art, though.
---
Looks kinda cool, I'm looking forward to giving it a a try. The marketing comment about "revolutionary mechanics" is a little bit of a laugher though, while it seems clever it's hardly revolutionary ... it's a pretty straight-ahead area control game. Some concerns about what looks like some very swingy luck (having to do with game length and replacing commander primarily, but combat resolution seems pretty coarse too for the amount of effort you put into it).

MSRP appears to be very high for what you get. The graphics are nice (as they usually are for CoA), but the gameplay better be worth it :)

This is all just impressions, so take it with a grain of salt. I hope to play it soon.

Initially interesting, despite the obvious randomness of the game (largely due to the break dice mechanism and the order in which the locations appear). However, with further plays it failed to live up to first impressions. The history here is limited, and in some cases inaccurate (possibly to fit into the melodramatic presentation of the game).

Looks like a great game, and the game designer was very gracious in supporting CHUCK-a-CON, but I can't seem to generate any interest in this game.  It just doesn't "fit" with old wargamers, and young people don't play wargames anymore.

RATING: 7
1. Design - comics criss-crossed with old propaganda photos. Beautiful game cards, solid design of components.
2. Mechanics - well, it's a card game. Play card, throw units to a building, snipe enemy generals, create infernos and in the end you throw a dice (one or more) to check if you defend (Soviets) or capture (Germans) building. Easy as 1,2,3.
3. Play - Hell of Stalingrad is fun game with lots of historical flavour. Specific game concept results in an extraordinary product. Highly recomennded - if you are not scare a luck factor.

This game is a lot of fun! The cards are loads of fun to play and it is fun just pouring troops into a battle in order to see them massacred.

People have said that this is just a lot of work to just roll a few dice against each other. But I look at it differently. The game is like we are maneuvering units on a map, as in a regular hex and counter board game, and once we are ready we are rolling on the CRT table for the results of the battle. In a sense it is really not much different than that.

RATING: 6
A card game representing the bloody Stalingrad conflict.  While I had fun with the game, there's not too much to it.  Basically, it comes down to a few lucky rolls at the end of a turn to resolve a conflict.  Perhaps by adding an extra dice for each unit might make some of the battle progression cards a little more meaningful?  Getting a single die for occupying a building card with a legion of troops and with no enemy units present hardly seems worth it.  I would play it again, but it is not one of my favorites, that's for sure.

This is one of those games which is fun to play, but it really could have been much better, game-wise and production-wise. What I liked about it was that the theme clicked and the gameplay was smooth and simple. 

But ... because it is a simple game, it should clock in at under an hour as there isn't much strategy here. This game is at best a filler. Unfortunately, the game length is long, and given the huge randomness involved, the ending can be anti-climactic. 

Randomness doesn't happen just because the game has dice. But unfortunately here, it's not a case where dice rolls average out. You make only a few rolls and it's all high-stakes - not a good combination.

And the artwork was just bad. It looked cheap and cheesy, and that's not how you want to go with a game that costs $65.00 retail.

Good light game, not a classic for me but its certainly fun.  The narrative and game play is fun, the game is a little to much abstraction to be considered a classic type conflict simulation.

Recommended for anyone interested in a war themed card game that is very playable and you're not a grognard looking for something deep deep.

You play the card he dies, he plays the card you die. After a collection of cards you both throw dice someone wins. Horrible graphics and an exercise in tedium. I started playing soltaire and after a few cards plays I just couldn't be bothered.

I found it completely pointless

Dude! Skull tracks, inferno counters, electric colored SS cards ... if ever there was a wargame begging for Metallica turned up to eleven, this is it. Plenty of flavor and some clever mechanics.

This is a strange game in that it is random, fiddly, longish, turns on crazy dice rolls, repetitive, unapologetic about playing fast and loose with history in places, a bit on the expensive side, and it sprawls all over our largish table when we play it ... but I still really, really like it. It is that rare game that is greater than the sum-of-its parts. I shouldn't like it as much as I do, but when you stand back far enough from the canvas to hide the brush-strokes, what emerges is a pretty good picture of the Stalingrad experience, at least from an emotional and psychological point-of-view.

Every criticism I've read of this game is true. You fiddle a bunch of cards and then everything comes down to the throw of the dice. It has a weird catch-up mechanic that funnels the game toward one last building on the final turn for all the marbles. Snipers throw Zeus-like thunderbolts and at times it seems like there's no point in trying to make any plan at all.

And yet, and yet ... I'd play it again right now if it was on offer. Don't know why I like this one so much, but I do. A happy problem to have.

What this game comes down to is fights over location cards that ends in an opposed die roll. The process of the fight is too long and it's still just an opposed die roll at the end. It takes too long to get from A to B and this game goes too long for what it is. If I want a rules-light game of grinding attrition in Stalingrad I'll play Storm Over Stalingrad instead.

RATING: 7
An interesting an almost brillian card game, that ultimately falls a little flat. For me the killer is the arbitrary nature of the resolution of the game, battle resolution combined with the time track and a few other issues, still impressive though as a design, every game has come down to the last dice roll, even if in game decisions are not as important as they should be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This does a good job of demonstrating the chaos of Stalingrad- the dynamics of play can shift rapidly- so if you're not comfortable with that, this might not be the game for you. However, if you want a game that is competitive down to the last round, this is definitely the game for you. 

Most wargames are based on a rationalization and an attempt to understand the forces at work in a battle. I like plenty of games like that. They don't really try to simulate what the experience for those actually running the battle at the time was- granted no game ever could. What THoS does is give a sense that you DON'T know what is going to happen- you can get a FEEL for it- but you don't KNOW. 

While I really love this game, I can see how some folks might not- it is NOT a game for control freaks.

This game is good. After one play I give it an "8". 

The things that I liked: 
[1] Easy but complex rules; 
[2] Great climate - I could just feel the intensity of the battle; 
[3] The asymmetric sides - playing Germans and Russians are two different stories; 
[4] The game flow - very smooth and dynamic;

The thing that I didn't like: 
[1] The pictures - especially on the building cards - some of them are just terrible. PIXELS world!!! Nowadays it is shameful to issue a game with such photos. Especially for that price...

When it comes to the break test system - I think it is ok. It reflects the "you never know" ambiance of the Stalingrad struggle.

One game seemed like enough to see everything on offer.  Pro: it is perhaps the bloodiest game ever done on Stalingrad.  Con: there really aren't all that many decision points for the players and even the best plan still comes down to a chancy die roll straight out of Risk.  I also found the overwrought graphics got in the way of my enjoyment.

A pure card treatment on this fatal battle.  Here is a description from the publisher's website:

Four card decks represent both German and Red Army formations, commanders, combat carnage, legendary heroes and of course, the buildings and landmarks of the ruined city. You get the chance to know all the names of the places here.  The sense of being there while playing the game is very strong.  

196 Counters represent German and Soviet generlas and commissars, storm troopers, grenadiers, NKVD, T34s, forts, StuGs and commandos that help charge up your assault or put steel in your defense.

The Hell of Stalingrad can be played in one 30 minute setting for a basic game or as long as 3 hours for a 4-player campaign game.

Who doesn't want a game like this?

After play, I realy like this game.  It is a ground-breaking game with many new game features that are applied nicely and appropriately to this particular battle.  It is a short game that can be completed in an afternoon for sure.  Each combat card unit is a participating unit in the streets and alleys of the city Stalingrad.   

Now that I called upon Vaily Zaitsev and he did a great thing - shooting the enemy leader and blowing off his head for that fatal +1 modifier!

Someone might not like the fact that there are too many dice rollings in one game.  However, at the same time, there are depth in making some important strategic and tactical decisions behind the scenes going on constantly.  

Overall, a fun and high tense game that is worthwhile to get played often.  Highly suitable for solitaire play too. Value for your hard earned money.

3 / 5 - Good.

This is an interesting and clever game, the apparent simplicity of which belies a considerable depth of both tactical and strategic choice. The "break test" mechanic both makes and breaks this game: it can seen like you play a lot of cards over gaining a single dice but a single dice can make all the difference. The test itself is awesomely tense but is can also be scarily random, as can the building card draw - if you draw a lot of river cards the game will go to the Germans with little the Soveits can do about it. Solo options on this (downloadable from the publishers site) are also engaging and worth your time. The art and production quality is awful, and the game can run a little longer than it can entirely sustain, but this contains the kernels of greatness even if it could do with a little more polishing.

I have played only the German solo game so far.  At the last gaming convention in LA, I played a full game and had a good time with it.   It always comes down to the break test dice.  Of course, I was playing the German and had overwhelming troops in the building but still lost because of the dice.

RATING: 7
entertaining for the first few plays, but i am not completely sold on it.  seems less of a system that can be 'gamed' than the peer it is often compared to - Panzer General.  does create a sense of a bloody struggle given the units that come-and-go for both sides and the leaders/heros that drop often to snipers. 

soviets seem to have a difficult time of getting rid of infernos, but the germans will likely have a tough time capturing a good defensive building that appears on turn 4 or 5.

Now for something completely different ... this one certainly is unique!

I had the pleasure to be taught this game by my very good friend Michel, so I avoided the slightly obtuse rules book, and within 2.5 hours of us sitting down to play, I had won the tournament scenario (as the USSR, with some help from my gracious opponent.)

Game sure looks nice, lots of chrome, and moves at a nice clip. The first turn took a while, and like anyone new to the game (but familiar with board wargames) I suffered a bit of a disconnect when we got to our first break roll (one of the few dice rolls in the game.)

OK, giving the game the benefit of the doubt, we sped on thru the next two turns, as I paid less attention to the chrome and more to a strategy to effect the dice.

Wow, the game zips along, has lots of Stalingrad atmospherics, is fast and furious in the card play, and was, simply, lots of fun.

The only thing I would have liked is: having your card play impact on the final dice roll even more and in different ways. In the end I was copacetic with this mechanic, I just wanted I wider range of variables.

All this written, I REALLY benefited from having the game taught to me by an excellent, experienced and unquestionably fair-minded friend and opponent.

If you can learn the game this way, I think there is a high probability you'll love it too!

Wacky, wild and quasi-brilliant. Extremely evocative game of Stalingrad. I like it just for the very innovative and non-traditional take on the battle.  Will surely acquire once the house rules dust has had time to settle.

Interesting and very bloody game about the battle for Stalingrad.  So far only played the Soviets, but the sniper war was entertaining (for my side anyway, for Germans not so much).

After two four-player games, I must say that HoS exceeded my expectations. It's to wargames what Battle 360/Patton 360 is to WWII documentaries: in-your-face fun with in-your-face graphics.  The one quible I have is best summed up by Chris who wrote "the final dice-off really needed to be more nuanced."  Regardless, I had a blast playing this game and would always be up for it.  It's a clever and unique design.

Many have complained about the combat resolution, but nothing beats having your heroic defenders of the Motherland hold off the Nazi hordes with their lone roll of a 6!

Want an idea about the brutality & horror involved in the battle for Stalingrad?

This is the game for you then. A bit long for what it is trying to accomplish though.

Poor rulebook, luckily it can be downloaded in a better version online, so no biggie.

Sold it.

Great, quick playing atmospheric card game.  The black and white photos on the card really enhance the game, and the game play captures the brutal nature of fighting the battle of Stalingrad.

Erstes Spiel aus einer Reihe, die mit "Fires of Midway" (erfolgreicher) fortgesetzt wurde. Ordentlicher Versuch, die Brutalität des Kampfes um Stalingrad qua Karten umzusetzen. Die Spielmechanik ist dem Midway-Spiel verwandt (Karten + Würfel, statt Flugzeugträger - bestimmte Gebäude in Stalingrad).
Das Regelheft allerdings ist eine Katastrophe - ich verweise als Ersatz auf die beiden vorzüglichen Videos von M. Arnaudo.

Only 1 game solitaire and 1 game with another player.
Initial impressions:
fun card wargame with some eurogame touch.

I like very much the small rectangular double-face unit counters. They actually see action almost immediately only on one side but it's good to see they have double powers.

It feels like "tap" very small cards (turn upside down actually) to activate special abilities. They get used and killed at high speed.They really give the brutal and bloody feel of Stalingrad.

A lot of random. I like cards. I like dice. I like random.

I love the theme.  Still trying to get a handle on how the mechanics for building up to the break test gel with the theme, but a game I'll definitely play a few more times.

Sometimes you just want to sit down and forget about the politics of conflict simulation.  HoS is the game that spills enough blood to forget about that crap.  FUN.

Interesting game, good cards mechanics and very tense, unfortunately seems (to me) a bit little luck oriented. Don't play against a lucky friend :)

A WW2 Card Game by Clash Of Arms with beautiful artwork & based on Hand Management system.One of my favourites about the Eastern Front.

The first game in the War is Hell series. Handles the situation very well - the "struggle" for Stalingrad.

See-saw effects and rather bloody, it has enough decision making trees to keep things interesting.

After the initial rush, has faded from memory.

Though it fills the player with some anticipation before the end of the game, I felt like I would've enjoyed the experience the same watching it being played than playing one side.

It may be a fun game to play once in a while face to face, but there are other more interesting ones.

I wont comment on the graphic design, but some control over the whole thing would've made the game a favor.

Very original, maybe too much for its own good. My opponents were a bit put off by the importance of the random draw of zones in the chance of victory, but the gameplay itself feels pretty thematic.

After spending quite a few moments reading the rulebook we started to play the game. Despite the rulebook the game itself goes very smoothly. Have to play more.

The graphics are ridiculously bad and look very cheap. I mean, for such an expensive game there should be at least average. The game itself seemed good enough.

Finally after a dry spell, this good gamer's cardgame comes out with a nice WWII battle setting.  It's not doubt a slugfest as was the real battle for this city.  Don't expect to whip through a game of this in 30 minutes.  I expect that experience and good hand management will outweigh luck in the long run for this game.

The use of actual photographs on all the cards and locations adds tremendously to the theme.  Game mechanics are pretty unique.  The game is a lot better than some other card wargames like Panzer General or Frontline D-Day.  Rulebook is not organized very well and makes the game seem a lot harder than it really is.  Gameplay is relatively fast and brutal as you fight it out over the buildings.

You send in your StuG-III's and your Stukas and Sd.Kfz.251's filled with Flammenwerfer-35 armed Pioneers, deftly setting a trap for your opponent's best NKVD troops to grind them to oblivion. You cannibalize your infantry to reconstitute your crack Panzer Kampfgruppen and replace your Veteran Officers, carefully build your hand around crack Snipers and re-supply / overrun cards, expertly determine the schwerpunkt and masterfully order battle resolution to maximize your assets. For all the blood and horror you are rewarded with the privilege of rolling 5 dice against your opponent's 3 dice. You have robbed him of the formation advantage, prevented him from putting out the now blazing inferno you have made of his tractor-works, and dominated the killing-ground with dug-in veterans. You have forced him to send unit after unit into withering MG-34 crossfire, you have forced him to slaughter his own troops to keep them from trying to escape the nightmare. You have driven him to the desperate measure of using his despicable political commissars to drum up ideological fervor at the end of a pistol barrel just to keep his "gulag" militia stumbling forward over the broken bodies of their comrades.

And then the untermensch rolls three sixes and drains all your carefully laid plans into the sewer with the rest of the decomposing flesh. The next thing you know the Fuhrer is commanding you to swallow a bullet in the form of a promotion to Generalfeldmarschall and your only alternative is to spend the next six months dying a slow death in Siberia.

Hellooooo Stalingrad!

RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play of the German edition.
The game was fun and playable even with only a basic knowledge of German, using the printed English rules.
The narrative was somewhat lost though, slightly made up for by the amusing German words.

I'd got this game to play with my kids, as a "real game" Game of Life replacement, but I'm not convinced it is light enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This game is pretty much Yahtzee meets the game of Life. That may sound like a nap waiting to happen, but this game is far from boring. My favorite thing in board games is when the game tells a story, and this game does that in spades. The only downside is that if you have repeated plays, even with the variability in the shuffled decks, you'll probably still gravitate towards the same kinds of cards each game - so it can get samey over many plays. But as a game you pull out and play two to four times a year, it's pretty fun.

[I]tl;dr - Maybe I need to give it a chance, but I was left never wanting to play this one again due to the luck of the die.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

CV was an ambitious game that was sunk by its dice. It would be fine if it played in a quicker time (or there was more way to mitigate the bad luck dice), but when we played I found myself rolling bad luck dice so often that I was so far behind the other opponents that I couldn't catch up. 

I can see how this game would deserve another chance - maybe I wouldn't roll quite so many bad lucks -- but I think my problems with the game go further than just bad luck. I dislike any game where a player can be totally removed from contention through no fault of their own. 

It's a shame, since I really love the theme -- kind of an updated version of the Game of Life. I would love to see a better version of this at some point. As is, though, it's definitely not doing it for me.

Caveat: it's a 7 or maybe even an 8 with the right group. For it to be a 7, you want to get into it and tell stories with the card. Otherwise, you might be left wondering why such a light game is so long. It's great fun, but only with the right audience.

I don't know why, but I really enjoy this light dice game. The goofy theme and low time/energy investment balances out unlucky rolls for me.

RATING: 6
5 plays / 2,3 players.

LIKE: A good couples game. Although we didn't get into the story of the lives too much, the game was better than I originally thought. The dice really add push-your-luck, mildly interesting decisions. Great art, humorous theme.
DISLIKE: Was some downtime between turns. Did feel a  little long, but there are ways we could speed things up. Slight leader snowball problem.

OVERALL: Upon replay, it was still good. In fact, the game becomes more competitive as the cards become more familiar. Two players is faster, because you are removing a card after each player's turn. Overall, a beer and pretzels game, which is a little fun. I wish the cards were more chaotic.

Usually I do not like comparing games in my comments, since it is quite uninformative if you do not remember or know the other game. This time I must.

In essence CV is a roll-and-buy style of game, very similar to Nations: The Dice Game, i.e., you roll and buy whatever you can from the common market with the symbols on your dice. The cards you buy allow you extra dice and currency. There are some rolling rules borrowed from Roll Through the Ages (disasters, 2 rerolls per turn). However, the closest equivalent is Nations: The Dice Game.

I have to say that CV suffers from bad playability to some extent. There are quite many symbols and the cards you can buy all require a number of them. It becomes rather laborous to figure out how to spend all your dice and permanent power ups to make the most out of it. Thus your energy is spent on pattern matching instead of meaningful tactical or strategic decisions. 

Once you get past the playability issues, it is quite fun to build up your CV. I found some humour in the game and the art is spot on. Rolling dice is always a blast.

RATING: 6.5
Initially I enjoyed this game a lot, but after a number of plays, my rating for it has started dropping as its blemishes have started to show.  The one thing I love about the game is its theme.  The theme of building a normal (by Western standards) life in the modern day is one that few games have used and fewer have used well (I'm looking at you, The Game of Life).  I'd love to see this theme used in more (and better) games.

Beyond the theme, though, I'm starting to find the game lacking in a number of aspects.  First, it's too long for what it is.  It is a Yahtzee-like dice chucker with a bit of strategy and a lot of luck.  The game does have luck mitigation effects, but it also has a serious snowballing problem.  A player who manages good early turns can turn that into a big lead that keeps growing.  If you struggle early, you'll have difficulty recovering later and gaining those luck-mitigating cards.  The winner can be quite obvious about 2/3 of the way through the game.

Second, the game uses something like 95% of its cards every game, so the replayability is low.  Really the only differences game to game are the goals and the starting cards, and if you're playing with 4, the starting cards are no different.

Speaking of playing with 4, don't.  The downtime in this game can be lengthy, and with 4 it becomes unbearable and the feeling of the game lasting too long is exacerbated.

In the end, this is a game that is just okay.  I'll probably keep it in my collection simply because I do like the theme, but I can't see myself playing it more than a couple of times per year.  Here's hoping a better "real life" themed game comes around that can replace CV in my collection.

RATING: 7.07
A light, [I]Yahtzee[/I]-style dice chucker.  

Great humorous art, and there is a certain entertainment factor associated with the story-telling aspect that can be employed as you follow a character throughout life.

However, as with all principally luck-driven games, sometimes you have the dice working against you and it feels really hard to accomplish anything of substance as another player literally runs away with the game.

As an example, if in early adulthood you miss out on one of the early cards that awards an extra die due to poor luck, then the lack of the additional die makes it much more difficult to secure a career, which makes it much more difficult to secure money to get the possessions which grant VPs, etc.

RATING: 7
I like the story you can build up around the development of your life history.  We house-ruled because the rules didn't seem clear that the unused balance of one off rewards of money or other icons could be carried forward and used in subsequent rounds.  This may well be wrong but it worked for us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The life events stuff are kind of amusing for the 5 seconds after it pops up. Then it becomes a long AP-prone game. There are just way too many symbols to keep track of and too many cards you want to buy and too many combinations while you're rolling dice yahtzee-style. It was too dry for me although I can see how some people would like it. I just can't see myself playing it again other than reluctantly. 4 players takes too long although maybe it's faster with 2 or even 3 players.

CV is a good game, simple and with a decent game duration. It is sufficiently deep in the theme and is very thematic. But I don't think there is too much replayability here, the cards follow the same patterns and I don't think it has room for too much different outcomes.

RATING: 7.9
A lot of fun, specially if you keep comparing your CV with each other. It's yet another game that takes the Yahtzee mechanism and run with it.
It is definitely luck-dependent with a lot of dice rolling and also with revealed cards (sometimes there is nothing good to buy, But a smarts choices help mitigate the feeling the dice are against you. The theme is really strong and the text on the cards is always amusing and it is a lot of fun to build a "new" life for yourself.

It's a dice game. I did better than I expected and found out there's more strategy than it seems at a glance. But I'm not super into Yahtzee style gameplay, especially if it takes too long. I think that if turns are chopping along quickly and players get into "telling the story" of their lives as they take their turns it can still be fun. But it can also get bogged down with a little AP and gaminess.

Gah, another Yahtzee variant!  Having overcome my phobia for games in which you roll dice and then roll them a few more times, always setting at least one aside, I have to say that I found CV a quite amusing diversion.  This was mostly due to the humorous cards that combinations of symbols on the dice are used to acquire. Together they build a surprisingly coherent narative of your career, material goods, marital status and interests. 

However, albeit less so than with Munchkin's humorous cards, I wonder about the replay value of this game once the chuckles have been had.  Strip away that humour and it is just a Yahtzee variant with straightforward set collection.

CV is well produced and the artwork is terrific.

Looks great but in a four-player game with two non-gamers this one was actually quite "gamey" and the level of AP was nearly unacceptable.

I'm going to bring it out with a group of gamers and see what they make of it.

I'm inclined to like it, but it did outstay its welcome. I suspect it becomes overly long with four.

Edit: Even with gamers, this one is a very forgettable experience. Feels a bit lifeless.

I have the impression the designer didn't think this through. It feels like it is released too soon, because a lot of things are just out of ballance. You need to get your engine running, but if you have a bit of bad luck with the cards that turn up, you are screwed from the beginning and will never catch up. 
Furthermore, social assistance is stupid. You need to be REALLY far behind, and in that case one extra card will change nothing really. All in all, this game is 90% luck, and if you have bad luck, all you can do is sit and watch. Pitty, because with some tweeks, it could be a decent game.

You know a game is good when my only complaint is that it didn't last long enough! This game is a lot of fun - simple rules, the art is good, and it tells a fun story. Only complaint is that it tends to end rather abruptly - once the cards run out you don't even get to finish out the round, so there is a likelihood that some people may get to have more turns than others.

Nagyon ötletes, helyenként vicces családi játék. Az életünket rakjuk ki kártyákból, amiket kockadobások eredményeiből vehetünk meg. A kockadobás része a Roll through the Ages-ből van másolva: itt is max. 7 kocka, alapból 4, a halálfej (itt szomorú arc) itt sem újradobható, a többi kétszer dobható újra, és ha 3 szomoró arc kijön, akkor csapás ér minket. 
Elég tematikus a játék. Ha gyerekünk születik, akkor nem árt egy jól fizető munka. Ha sokat mozgunk, több pontunk lesz egészség terén, stb. Szórakoztató, gyors, bármikor kategória. A rövidsége miatt tolerálom a hatalmas szerencsefüggőséget is. A játék végi 47 pontomból 21 pontot az utolsó körömben szereztem, mert elég jót dobtam. Egy rosszabb dobással csak 1-2 pontot szereztem volna, és nem első vagyok, hanem messze lemaradva utolsó. Ehhez mérten kell komolyan venni a játékot:) De még egyszer mondom, a maga nemében, tehát könnyed átvezetőnek nagyon jó!!!

Same theme with "funny friends", very different mechanics. I prefer this one.

Fun little dice and card game. This is definitely on the lighter end of the spectrum. Roll dice to get symbols to collect cards of different colors that are kept in a tableau. Only 1 card per color can give you the "awesome" special ability associated with it, such as extra symbols, extra dice, extra rerolls. I can see this getting repetitive as their is not a very large card count and pretty much every card will be seen in each game. There is also no real player interaction other than taking a card someone else wanted. This can be a good thing to some people. I will teach this to Flo as I think she will like it.

Rarely the first choice, but always fun. Easy enough to teach new players.

Most often played with two players, three-player-games are fun, too; doesn't really work with four (played only once). 

It's almost impossible to get the cards you want with four players unless they are added just before your turn and they won't be around on your next turn. High-cost cards are also very difficult to obtain.

With two or three players, you usually get at least one card each turn.

The problem is that this is just way, waaaay too long for what it is. Halfway through the game, you'll be ditching the attempts to explain the theme and you'll just be matching symbols, hoping to bring it to an end. After my second play, I swore I'd never play it again. Plus, the component quality of the tokens and dice is pretty low.

I was really intrigued by the theme of the game, which sounds pretty fun, and I really like dice games, so I was looking forward to this one!

The game is cute with some interesting ideas, but I kind of felt like it was playing me, rather than me playing the game.  Early in the game, you kind of end up getting what you get since you only have 4 dice and you'll just take whatever you can get, and those cards you get will push you toward other certain cards later.  So, many times, there isn't a lot of decision making involved; you take what the dice and your cards give you.

I wouldn't have a problem with this, but it's an hour long game of not really making decisions.  It just felt a bit on the long side for what it is.

Overall, neat idea and definitely some fun involved, but not one of my favorites.

Fun Yahtzee style game. It certainly looks like there was made an big effort to make the cards quite thematic, which adds a lot to the game. The tokens can become a bit fiddly (because we noticed you dont always remember to change them once you get different cards), but other than that, great.

The theme is so charming! Sadly, the gameplay is pretty ho-hum. Strategy here isn't deep, so this game must live or die by the strength of its storytelling. It failed me. The cards I added to my CV never felt much like life experiences -- just elements in my set collections.

Christmas 2015 gift for my wife.  She's not much of a gamer but two of her childhood favorites are The Game of Life and Yahtzee.  Hopefully, this will bring her into the 21st century of gaming. ;-)

Have played three times, twice with the wife.  First game I beat her soundly since she wasn't familiar with the rules.  Second game was a 3P with our daughter and my wife beat our daughter easily who, in turn, beat me by one point.  I guess she likes it now. :-P

Nah.  This game plays itself.  This has over-simplified Yahtzee style mechanics that seems like they were made for really, really young children.  Pasted on is a more grown up theme that just peels away too easily.  Since there isn't a real challenge, this is more like an activity than a game.  Roll dice to buy cards to get more cards and blah, blah blah... [snore]

I really enjoy this game.  It is a bit of a set collection, but also takes you through a journey of life.  The special abilities are fun.  I only wish that the game came with more cards.

After a few plays, the game starts to feel too much the same.  As the base game is made, almost all the cards will make it out into the game.  Because of this, you kind of have expectations for those cards to come out.  I would like more cards available so that one could not predict which cards will come out.

It really takes the best qualities out of these three games into a single streamlined game but unfortunately it's not perfect.
It is gorgeous and quite well done, but there was a lack of tension/player interaction that could have elevated the game.
A few icons/card design aspects could have been better in my opinion.

Rerolling dice meets set collection with a life theme. Breezy casual game of putting together your life. Thematically money symbols ensures you can buy the most stuff which gets you the VPs.

Lack of a variety of goal cards and seeing all cards in a single game lowers the replayability. Several powerful strategies of getting happiness symbols to avoid random dice rolls. Random card draw can reward players randomly. Mostly a solitaire game

This is a good game but I don't know what it's trying to be. It's sort of a tableau building game but you're constantly changing your tableau. It's a dice game but it's not very quick as each turn, you've got lots of resources to suss out your best move and it's got great artwork which makes me think of this as a lighthearted type of game but it's really just about scrounging up as many points as possible in the most efficient way possible. It's not bad but I'm not playing this with my casual gamers cause it would take too long and I'm not playing it with hardcore gamers cause the choices aren't very exciting to make. It's still a good game, just not one I'm eager to play.

To say I didn't like this game would be an understatement.  First, the game gives you goals.  Then, it makes it so you have to be supremely lucky to fulfill them.  There's almost no intent here.  The cards have to come out and be available to you, you have to get the right symbols on the dice and cards you have, and you have to not lose the cards later if you do get them.  And let's talk about losing cards: unless you get some insurance or one of the later cards that converts a frown into a wild, you're pretty much screwed if you roll poorly.  This really sucks.  I've often said that the mark of a good card game is that there's something constructive you can do with just about any hand.  The same applies to dice games, I think.  In Roll Through the Ages you can try to press on with disasters because eventually they flip and become good.  Or you can plan for them and purposefully take precautions.  In To Court the King you can always take the crap card, which can later be converted to an extra die - which is pretty good.  CV is not those games.  Roll three frowns and it's a shiv in the back for you (double painful because you likely don't gain a card in addition to losing one).  I have no problem with the theme, and I thought the art and card content was actually pretty fun.  Not nearly enough to get me to play this painful turd again.

Players take turns rolling the dice, and working their way though their life, acquiring cards and trying to score the most victory points.

Fun little die roller, supported by charming art on the cards.  On their turn, players roll four dice, and may re-roll up to two more times.  Die results can be health, money, relationship, ideas, happy, sad - sad results must be frozen.  The results are used to purchase cards off a sliding timeline of life events.  So for several relationship results, you may be able to claim "Get a Job at Dad's Company".  Cards purchased begin to build a tableau for you, and may give you symbols that you can spend on future turns, adding to your die rolls.  So you essentially build an engine of life experience cards.  The game ends when the three game decks have been worked through (ending with the old age deck!).  Victory points are awarded for sets of same coloured cards from three of the decks, as well as the total number of cards in your yellow possessions deck.

Cute, charming die roller, possibly a little too long for the game fun that is paid back to you.  The first play is amusing as you chuckle at the cards - but it remains to be seen if there is enough meat to for it to remain a keeper in the collection.

Special prize for the second smelliest game I've ever ... smelled.  The cards are truly rank.  (First prize was for Municipium).

The dice rolling in this game is not as much fun as I thought it would be. The misfortunes do provide for some press your luck, but you can usually get something valuable each turn without too much effort. The part of the game that really keeps it fun is the life story you create with the cards you get (but I don't know how long this will last).

Juego sencillo de crear combos de cartas, gestionando dados, que aunque no llegan a resultar decisivos, sí que generan una mecánica que resulta un poco repetitiva, y hace que el juego se haga un pelín largo.

Breezy game; *extremely* thematic.  You almost play this more to tell a story than to actually win.  Like any dice game, bad rolls can hose you (not just for the penalty of losing a card, but also the opportunity cost of gaining fewer cards, which can put you down two cards if you're not careful).

The expansion sounds fairly awful, honestly, but I'd gladly play the base game.  Down time kinda sucks; it wasn't great with even three, so I don't think I'd ever want to play this with four.  There's pretty much nothing to do when it's not your turn.

The first time I played, it was hilarious imagining this fitness-obsessed jerk turn into a selfless doctor, etc., but in the second playing you will see all the same cards, and the idea of the theme melts faster than butter in the sun.

A dry, dice game that tends to snowball. If I play one more time, I might rate it a two. It was dull. Also, all the people in the game are white, which just seems needlessly exclusive in this day and age.

"Life" is one of my favourite boardgame themes.

While CV lacks the wacky humour and adult themes of Funny Friends and is ultimately a luck-filled dice game, it is a much smoother rendition of the theme. The rules complexity is appropriate for the length and amount of control in the game (though the rulebook contains some annoying gaps).

The art is excellent.

Yahtzee, the Game of Life edition. Compared to other variants this is fairly strongly spruced up with lots of cards and additional abilities. On one hand that's a strength of the game: there are often reasonably interesting choices to be made and, if you are so inclined, even a (sometimes more, sometimes less) compelling narrative. That sounds like quite an achievement for a Yahtzee variant.

On the other hand, it is also the game's primary weakness: Occasionally, you do get played by the dice and the cards, and the additional chrome makes it run a little long if that happens. Even if that does not happen you often just collect cards because they are what you can get rather than what you would like to have, and the wealth of symbols and cards can easily lead to overlong downtimes when people try to match them up in the most beneficial way.

Even with these detractors in mind, CV is easily one of the better attempts at making a game out of Yahtzee.

This game wasn't very much fun. There was supposed to be a theme (human life), but it was pretty weak. It felt like just a bunch of cards with arbitrarily balanced stats and no actual movement or 2D representation. Way too much dice-rolling that was more tedious than complex.

RATING: 7
Artwork and dice are really nice.  Cards are flimsy and not linen finished.

There is more strategy than is apparent in this push your luck style dice game.  Cards are fun because they seem to tell a story and they are well balanced.  End game scoring is tight and because of hidden goals it can be a surprise who won.

What a great game is this! But we have our own rules combined with the normal rules..
1. Jokers only for health, knowledge and social cards.
2. 3 smileys only for health, knowledge and social cards.
3. don't forget to put the money and the CV cards up front..

This game is actually pretty good.  It takes the basic theme of Life and employs the dice mechanic from Yahtzee, i.e., going through life's stages, but is an actual game.

The art is delightful, the theme is strong, and the game has some actual strategy.

A slightly more complicated version of Yahtzee. Players roll dice for the symbols necessary to acquire cards which can provide additional symbols, points, or other benefits. The theme is clever and adds to the experience, but in the end there just didn't seem to be much to the actual game.

2 Player game- At the second phase, the game becomes an exercise in motions. Both players are able to easily build a tableau that requires only one die roll to afford any card in the market. It turned into nothings more than roll then choose with no meaningful decisions. Just grab the available point card. It would better suit a 15 minute playtime, but at 30ish minutes for 2 players, it was too long not to care about actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Good simple game.

Takes no more than 10 min to explain, if not 5. Simple mechanics. Lots of fun telling a story to explain the card(s) you just grabbed.

The designer could just add more cards with an expansion to add more players (especially the childhood cards). I wish we could play up to six players.

I agree with what Rahdo says in his final thoughts of his video, it's one of the best games of 2013.

NOTE TO THE DESIGNER
The french version is partly english, should be fully in French.
Ex. : Footing, master, management are not french words, they're english.

You never say a "master en management", you say "maîtrise en gestion", nor do you say "Footing", you say "Course à pied".

Is it me or France will need to change its name to Frangle soon? This is one of the crappy things I've noticed in the french version.

Another thing in all versions, the box is waaaaay too big for its content. I mean the box is practically empty. All that's inside could have fit inside a box half its size. Saving money on shipping and production costs. The age of big boxes with nothing in it is long past (belongs to the 1980s and 1990s).

I think this game is underrated by the community.

This is a fun yahtzee type dice roller. It isn't very heavy, but there are some decisions to make and a bit of luck thrown in.

This is one I couldn't care less about winning because it is that satisfying and that fun.

Sam's birthday 2014.

CV is very much like Roll Through the Ages in terms of play and feel. Both of which have a limited set of powers which are basically all available every game, but, due to dice rolls, you may take one over another, which may then steer you towards a slightly different path. In CV you have a take-and-pass stage for the beginning cards, somewhat like 7 Wonders, and then on your turns you roll up to 3 times (can't re-roll sad faces) to choose cards, adding action cards to help as necessary. Much like building cities in RTtA gives you more dice, building cards with dice symbols gives you more dice. Unlike RTtA, these can be lost (rolling 3 sad faces makes you discard a card). 

The aspect that most steers card selection in CV is the bonus cards - each person has a private one, and there is a shared public one, much like Suburbia. In one game, I had the yellow card bonus, and Sam had one for yellow/job cards, so we were fighting over the yellow cards more than usual. If the public bonus is for job cards, you might fight over the job cards more than usual. But the goal cards can be a distraction more than a winning path, you may just want to concentrate on building your cards for the most points. One game I got the "get an orange card for one less" card, and built a string of orange cards for a lot of points. 

We have little inside jokes for the cards, like the "friend from work" is the "affair from work" ("Look, it's your affair from work"). Stuff like that that amuses us. 

The rules are pretty simple, it's pretty easy to set up and teach. It has a couple of things going for it, as long as no one expects an extremely deep game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Possibly one of the worst example of over-packaging that I have ever seen in my life (it makes as much sense to ship a deck of playing cards in a shoe box).

Surprisingly interesting play.  Is fast, tactical and strategic in choices you must make, some humour to the theme.  Need to play this properly, but this feels like a keeper (which I didn't expect).  Played it now, has a very serious runaway leader problem with no way to solve it (doesn't forgive very much with a good dose of luck of the draw).

A quick playthrough at the UK Games Expo 2015 - the game plays well, and is suitable for all ages. The gameplay is nice and fluid, and all round the game is great to play. Only supports four players (though we spoke to the designer and he says it would work with five, but adding in the Gossip expansion should make it better by adding more cards.
All in all, a lighter game, the rules are straightforward. An easy to pick up and nice to play game.

Very bright and funny Yahtzee-style game, in which you're matching dice to symbols on cards in order to add them to your 'CV'.

The cards depict jobs or events in life, and fall into categories.  All the cards offer some kind of bonus, but only the top card of each category gives you its bonus so there's some strategy in which cards to take and when.  The bonuses tend to take the form of extra dice symbols or end-game points (of which all are counted, not just the top one).

I played this with 4 players and it was a blast, lots of laughter and joking with the brilliant narratives that come from the cards the players choose, the wacky artwork on the cards really supports this too.  Really nicely produced game, and although the mechanics aren't deep, it's buckets of fun to play.

At its best, CV is a tense luck-pushing game where players get to tell a lighthearted story while constantly having to decide which abilities and bonuses are best to gain (and give up) in the pursuit of points (or denying points to others). At its worst, CV is an overly long game where players can easily fall out of contention due to bad luck. The game has a great concept and theme, but the experience isn't always enjoyable. There is some fun to be had, but it's on the bubble as to whether or not it stays in my collection.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (July 2015)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game, a friend always carried it with her and asked me several times to play it with her :D, it is her favorite game, so I finally relented and played CV.

The game is very easy to explain and it flows quickly. The art is quite good and the theme was surprisingly good. It is very fun to see what happens in your life and comparing it with your “real” life :D.

It has a fair amount of luck, but it seems to me you have many ways to, somewhat, mitigate it, so it doesn’t bother me.

CV is unfair toward the third and fourth player (the first player has an advantage), they always play last and when the secret objectives have things in common they always have less opportunity to get the right cards. I’m not sure if this is ok or if it is a rule mistake, but every round (when you add new cards) the first player should be rotated.

I also think it is a 2 player game, with more players the downtime becomes excessive for such a simple game (nothing to consider during other player´s turn). What I most dislike in games is an excessive downtime.

Bottom line, CV is too light for me but I would play if requested. I had fun playing it and perhaps it offers more than meets the eye. Time will tell.

Pleasant, family-friendly, dice-oriented card drafter in the same family as Machi Koro and Valeria.  You roll dice to purchase cards, which give you more resources to buy cards that score by the set or according to goal cards.  Simple, quick-paced, and fun, but requiring lots of icon-comparing.  The theme is fun to look at at the end of the game, but I didn't notice it very much during gameplay.

Sometimes you get a 'misfortune' or you aren't able to buy a card just because of how the dice roll. The game offers a few ways to migrate 'misfortune' but that is very limited and the penalty of a misfortune still is severe. The beginning of the game is very luck driven, this becomes a little better towards the end when you have tokens to aid with card buying. The game relies strongly on its theme and its theme does 'a good job' for this game.

Didn't capture my imagination. Great artwork and decent production, but in the end it was throwing dice and hoping for the results you needed. Maybe you had cards that could change them into what you need - or maybe you had cards that supplied tokens so the dice were unnecessary... Either way, it rarely felt like there was any tension - we were just picking cards that were funny within the context of our 'CV', or would help nail another card on the board. And then doing it all over again on our next turn.

Yahtzee meets [gameid=16366]. The special functions of each card add a bit more decisions but in the end the mercy of the dice is most decisive. Still, the theme makes the game and it's a good choice when simple fun is the goal while maintaining a modicum of relevant gameplay.

One of my favorite Yahtzee-style games. It has wonderful art. Probably plays best with 2. But since every card will pop up, the replay value does seem to be limited. It gets very samey very quickly, without much excitement or interesting "arc' involved. 

I wish there was just a hair bit more going on.

An entertaining idea, it's more fun if you get into the whole "living out your life" theme, especially if you lecture other people about how they should be caring more about family, or actually trying to hold down a job, or something like that. The game is completely solitary, and quite luck-filled, mainly due to the luck of the card draw that comes up. So it's best if played quickly. At 30 minutes, it's great. After 45 minutes, it begins to feel more burdensome.

Nice and easy game. A lot depends on luck and how your dice are rolled. However, the game doesn't take too long. Moreover, everyone usually can do at least something during their turn. And as the cards get more expensive, so do the income of the players. It would take extremely bad luck (or really bad play, obviously) for someone to not be able to buy anything. And finally - I love the custom die. They are beautiful.

Nice and easy game. A lot depends on luck and how your dice are rolled. However, the game doesn't take too long. Moreover, everyone usually can do at least something during their turn. And as the cards get more expensive, so do the income of the players. It would take extremely bad luck (or really bad play, obviously) for someone to not be able to buy anything. And finally - I love the custom die. They are beautiful.

Kiegészítés: több, mint egy év után újra játszottam vele, sajnos nem tartom túl jónak. A magyar kiadásban maradt egy angol lap, ami nem nagy gáz, de mégis. Kicsit tematikusabbnak éltem már meg, mint legutóbb, de akármennyire is furcsa, egy ilyen egyszerű játékhoz képest nagyon nehezen átlátható és túl hosszú is. Szabáylértelmezésileg is merültek fel kérdések, sajnos maga a szabálykönyv nem ad választ minden felmerülő kérdésre. Kár érte...

CV is a tough game for me to rate.

I think it's okay as a passtime but it definately feels like something for non gamers.

the secret objectives are not balanced in my opinion. the one that gives three points for each CV card in possesion is a bit strong.
Nonetheless that player ended with 58 points in our thrre player game. Two pints behind me and well ahead of the 40 points in third place.
We had a laugh with it. I was a celebrity professor and CEO at the end of the game that owned a mansion.
I much prefer this over the game life allthough the only comparison is that they both tell a story.
Probably the most clever thing in the game is that children come at a cost allthough they bring you happiness. I up my rating with .5 for that.
Oh and I wanted to become a boardgame designer but didn't succeed :)

It might deserve 5, but because it's damn long and not that unique I'll give this 4. If I want to play yatzee-kind-of-game, then there are a lot of better options than this. One hour is just too much. The theme is excellent, the graphics are great, but that's it. Missed potential.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Gameplay is built around the Yahtzee-style dice rolling and re-rolling system. On their dice, players are trying to roll sets of symbols that allow them to acquire cards; each round these cards give benefits of some kind, such as new symbols and special abilities. At the end of the game, each kind of card scores points for the player.

Played once, 3p.  I really don't know why I liked this game so much.  It really is just Dominion with unique dice (though you don't build a DECK so much - more of a tableau builder). But the narrative was so fun, like Funny Friends, only slightly less crass I suppose.  Worth playing.

As long as you don't take it too seriously, this is actually kind of entertaining.  Uses dice with the yahtzee mechanic where you can roll three times unless you roll sad faces.  Pay dice to acquire cards which grant you different die faces to use in future and/or give more dice, points, etc...  Sometimes, this game can feel a bit long as you wait for other people to work through their options for purchase on their turn - which can get old for what is a light game.

[u]Comments:[/u]
CV is a really decent game, that is almost everything that I hoped Funny Friends would have been. Its a quick way to live through another person life from childhood all the way into old age, and it tells a really interesting story about what that person has done. Each game is unique, and almost every game has something suprising happen in it. Rules are pretty simple, and easily teachable. The graphic design, and card art, are really some of the best i have ever seen. I say well done to GRANNA on that account.

What really brings this game down though is the sheer lack of cards provided in the base game. The box is huge and you only get 83 cards to play with, some of those you might not even play with during the game. This does end up creating some routine feeling to the game if played repeatedly in one sitting (which you will most likely really want to do). Hopefully the designer and publisher are already hard at work on crafting an expansion because the game almost feels like there needs to be more to really make it shine. More goals, more childhood experiences, more actions, more of everything. This game should easily come with >150 cards, and as of right now while being a really great fun little game it just feels like it is lacking a bit.

The expansion definitely adds something special to this game. I am going to keep this one for now and see what comes of playing with the expansion.

Interesting theme, looks cool with the dice and cards but this game fell completely flat for me. My Essen dud (well, one of them!).

Normally like heavier games without much luck . This is a light game with a lot of luck . That said ,  this is an enjoyable game. For many it's the theme  that grabs them. For me ,  it's the set collection aspect but at the beginning you need to get different type cards to get your engine going like extra dice . When playing as a 2 player , found that most of the time , whoever seems to be winning at about the halfway stage tends to win . Lot of fun , and after all , actually playing the game is my real life CV.

CV is a light card drafting game that uses the familiar roll/re-roll mechanic of Yahtzee.  However, in this case the dice are custom made for this game.  The symbols you roll allow you to draft cards with those that have matching symbols on them.  You then take those cards into your tableau, or CV.  The cards give you some benefit, whether that be more symbols to help you get even more cards down the road, or points toward winning the game.  Also, as you gain cards you are effectively creating a winding life story.  Part of the fun is that at the end of the game you can look back over the life your in-game alter ego just lead, and laugh about the goofy things he/she did.

The cards are over sized, and of a good quality, with silly artwork that is fun to look over.  However, they have a strange smell to them that is hard to miss.

CV is a fun distraction from more heavy and serious games, and from real life too!

• CAT: Jugat a 3 jugadors amb el Bascu i el Fran FG al Queimada, i a 2 jugadors amb l'Eneida. És un joc força fresc, original, temàtic i amb certa rejugabilitat (tot i ser, en essència, un altre reaprofitament de la mecànica clàssica del Yahtzee per fer "set collection" mitjançant un "draft" en funció dels daus i els modificadors) que requereix dels jugadors un petit esforç per viure i "rolejar" un xic la història de cadascun dels personatges que es van desenvolupant durant la partida. Té un parell de mecanismes de compensació que m'agraden molt: el de les cartes d'infantesa (que accelera el progrés vital dels personatges) i el dels serveis socials (que pal·lia els possibles despenjaments d'alguns jugadors). No m'agrada que CV s'hagi afegit a la tendència del sobredimensionament de capses i preus (com ja va passar amb Splendor). Un altre joc que porta més aire que components. Tot i això, amb el grup adient pot causar furor.

• ESP: Jugado a 3 jugadores con Bascu y Fran FG en el Queimada, y a 2 jugadores con Eneida. Es un juego bastante fresco, original, temático y con cierta rejugabilidad (aún siendo, en esencia, otro reaprovechamiento de la mecánica clásica del Yahtzee para hacer "set collection" mediante un "draft" en función de los dados y los modificadores) que requiere de los jugadores un pequeño esfuerzo para vivir y "rolear" una pizca la historia de cada uno de los personajes que se van desarrollando durante la partida. Tiene un par de mecanismos de compensación que me gustan mucho: el de las cartas de infancia (que acelera el progreso vital de los personajes) y el de los servicios sociales (que palía los posibles descuelgues de algunos jugadores). No me gusta que CV se haya sumado a la tendencia del sobredimensionado de cajas y precios (como ya pasó con Splendor). Otro juego que lleva más aire que componentes. Aún así, con el grupo adecuado puede causar furor.

• ENG: Played at 3 players with Bascu and Fran FG at Queimada bar, and at 2 players with Eneida. It's a pretty fresh game, creative, thematic and with some replay value (still being essentially another reutilization of the classic Yahtzee mechanic for doing "set collection" through a "draft" based on the roll results and dice modificators) that requires from players a little effort for living and "role playing" a bit the story of each of the characters developed during the game. This game has a very elegant pair of compensation mechanisms: the childhood cards (that speeds up the vital progress of the characters) and the social provisions (that palliates the possible lack of success of some players). I don't like that CV has joined the same tendency as Splendor of oversizing and overpricing the games. This is another game that comes with more air than components in the box. Even so, with the right group of players this game can succeed.

Takes the Yahtzee mechanic from King of Tokyo or (probably closer) Bang! The Dice Game but then layers on almost a story-telling game. Really enjoyed the first play. My first bike led to a focus on physical fitness as a teen before I went to college and earned a PhD. When calamity struck, I was forced to give up my fitness routine and let my CPR skills lapse. I finally found a job, but found it unfulfilling and after some psychotherapy decided to retire early (knowing I had my pension money coming). I became a celebrity due to my amazing memorization powers and used my pension money to invest in a factory. Quite a life! Just a few complaints: the box is ridiculously oversized; the components are sort of so-so; wish there were more cards included in the base game.

Bought it because I thought it was about aircraft carriers :(

Seriously, an "ok" game, no tension at all, there is a "winner" at the end but the fun is all about the social, chitchatting on your own life.
The gameplay is really simple, but the lack of a true goal does get boring in the long run. 
Excellent for a (single) holiday game with non-gaming parents.

RATING: 7
The storytelling aspect in this game is very cool & works very well, so the theme of a "life-simulator" is there in spades. Oddly enjoyable to play, the combo-building is fun, and the game definitely shines with players who can emphatize with the theme. It's more about telling your story and laughing about the combos than crunching numbers with the mechanic, which has a huge luck/randomness-factor.

The starting player also seems to get first to the best cards, so that mechanic is probably a bit broken.

It's too long with 4 players; too much downtime & playing time goes through the roof. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Huge disappointment for me.  I am always looking for a Game of Life replacement.....this is NOT it!  The first play you see every single card in the game....and that was just with 2 players.  There is very little variety.  You sometimes can get the things you want but it all depends on your dice rolling and what previous cards you got in earlier rounds.

I do like that you have to choose which card you want to be able to use.  If you get a new card it can go in front for your new ability or in the back and keep your old ability.  That was all I liked about this game.

Fun little dice rolling game with very little strategy. I bought it after watching Rahdo's video. Hubby isn't a big fan, but is usually willing to play. Works well with non-gamer friends. The artwork is really what takes CV from mediocre to fun. A great choice when we are too tired for a more "thinky" game.

RATING: 7
Feels like The Game of Life: The Dice Game...but the decisions make this one much more of a brain-burner than the theme and artwork may suggest. Really wish there was a way to make it so not all the cards came out in every game to keep things fresh and interesting. I may also need to house rule that you can only utilize three smiley faces on your turn, because anyone who manages to get 6 on a regular basis will probably end up winning. Still, this is one of the few Yahtzee clones that I can actually stomach. 

Replaces Yahtzee.

Eines meiner Herz-Spiele. Mit wunderschönst illustrierten Karten skizziert man hier ein Leben. Vom ersten Fahrrad über die Studienfreunde bis zu den Enkelkindern und später zum Rentnerdasein.

Fantastisches, unfassbares Spiel.

The art is delicious, and the game cards are very clever. You can't help but smile when you see the reasoning between the cards names and effects, or the beautiful and funny illustrations... They manage to integrate the theme quite well into the game :)

Sadly, this is the classic example of the game playing for you. You usually don't have any choice at all. You just roll and take whatever cards you can take.

That wouldn't be a big issue, but the game is 1 hour long (at the end, there are too many dice and tokens involved, and mathematical calculation of combos for points) and the game drags a bit. This is a very lght game, it should not drag at all!

I think you would enjoy the first few games, and then it will stay on the shelf until you find some new friends to play with.

What it does succeed on is building a life story :-)

Gioco di carte umoristico. L'obiettivo è quello di fare più esperienze e soldi durante la propria vita, dalla giovinezza alla vecchiaia. Molto soggetto alla pesca delle carte il gioco è punta la sua forza sull'humor. Simpatico ma poco longevo.

The entire game is not in the tired Yahtzee mechanic, but in the brilliant storytelling aspects, the smart game presentation and, in no small measure, the original and contemporary card art. It won't be popular with everyone, and it's certainly a mite longer than it needs to be, but play with an open mind and a light heart and there's little to complain about.

Strategists, if they insist, will likely get a little more life out of the game by learning the deck.

1 Play - During my first play I got a bit bored, so that was not a good sign. With the right crowd and some banter this might be an experience to share a laugh over. However, the gameplay doesn't hold a lot of depth and the novelty of the cards didn't last too long for our group. I can definitely see the opposite being true in a different group though. 

Unfair and other games I think do a better job of tablaeu building.

Yahtzee + Life (but fun). Light dice rolling and engine building. Plays well with 2 players. Family friendly, accessible story building theme with playful art. Light and easy to teach, but some strategic elements (multiple viable strategies, individual vp goal cards). Luck plays a noticeable role, but there are many ways to mitigate it through purchasable card powers. Welfare/catch-up mechanism present.

RATING: 7
This came has the normal Yahtzee / King of Tokyo dice rolling mechanic. On each side of the die there are different resource symbols, and on your turn you buy cards from the conveyer belt on the board and add them to your life. The game breaks these into categories by which your life is judged (by the VP cards). It's your Intelligence, Healthiness, Relationships, your Job and your latest expensive toy. The game is designed well, and cards build and combo with each other, but more to the point, each card is thematically funny and very well thought out. For example, the University card produces either an intelligence or a relationship, but not both.

A charming little dice roller, a la Yahtzee and a million other "three rolls and you're out" type games. It's practically its own genre at this point.
This is a little different, though.  There's a bit of strategy as you select the jobs, education, levels of health, and friends that will impact the later parts of the game...by old age, your priorities will shift to money and happiness...have you built enough of a life for yourself to buy a 7-point mansion?  Perhaps, but at what cost to your relationships?
It's fun, and there's a tiny story for each player in each game. Cool game.  Shame about how hard it is to get in the States, though.  I had to do some wrangling to make it happen.  I think it was worth it.

I have always wanted to create a game where you create a life chronology as a result of game play.  Blood Royale had elements of that but way too much other stuff (like war).  So I had high hopes for this.  But the fact that you can change your chronology (except for jobs and possessions) kinda kills the story line.  I also think that lost cards should be kept and laid upside down so you can reconstruct your life at the end of the game.

As to the game itself.  It's biggest flaws are some unbalanced goal cards and, most importantly, that it is not scaled down for fewer players.  I think that 1/4 of the cards should be taken out in a 3-player game and 1/2 in a 2-player affair, so that you get the same ratio of cards to players regardless of number of players.

Not bad, the mechanics work and everything, but it's somewhat only funny and entertaining after you play it for the first time. Because of the nature of the game, you will see all the cards after first play. Later on, it loses its charm (lots of humor and great illustrations) and you focus on pure optimization vs roll, so basically a yahtzee game. I like how cards are designed to be aligned thematically with reality - it's easy to explain, why cards have certain symbols and the explanation itself can be funny, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After the first play (2-player), I rated it a 6. It was light, fun enough, and we really enjoyed looking at the art and creating stories for our characters as the game progressed. My problem is I feel like there is no replay value. We saw all the cards (except one) in our first playthrough, and our subsequent play was just a "points grab" the whole time. Our second play was far less fun, and we bith ended up with much higher scores as there was no incentive to "create" characters as opposed to choosing cards directly for end-game scoring.

I think this game really suffers from a lack of variety. It should have included twice the amount of cards in the box and used a random selection every time. This might lead to games with no possesions or limited social options, which would in turn make the game more "swingy" depending on the different life goals people got. Besides being thematically appropriate since you then couldn't really plan for future life stages exactly, it would keep the tone of gameplay closer to where it should be for this game's weight.

As it is, I would not play this again. I think you should definitely try it out and play it once if you would like to play an updated take on The Game of Life. I would not buy this game unless you plan on leaving it in a closet and only playing it once or twice a year.

The collector life goal (1 vp / yellow) is way underpowered compared to all other goals. Either need to remove that card from the game or house rule that it's 3 vp per yellow. Otherwise, you will always be last if it's your secret goal. All other goals encourage you to go for cards that help you buy more cards, fulfill other public goals at the same time, or encourage you to go for the cards that get you the big multiplier points (relationships, knowledge, and health, I think). This life goal is the only one that's different from the others for no reason. People will argue that it's because you already get points for yellow cards, but they're so hard to get that you won't be getting more than three (same as everyone else), you'll get three points while everyone else is getting more than 10-12 points from their secret goals. Like the theme, but since there was nothing I could do to not be last, I'm rating it a 3. Very unpleasant experience.

Hard to give thus one a proper rating. I really enjoy playing it, and I'm always excited by the theme, but the whole thing can feel a bit gimmicky at times. I'm not convinced there is a solid scoring system here and might opt for public goals to be scored by everybody in the future. Not all goals are created equal either, like if one player gets points for each token he has at the end of the game- that's just scoring points for what should come naturally! Still, this is nothing more than a kooky filler game, and it does that quite well.  If I had to use one word to sum it all up, I would say CV is charming. Very very charming.

This game is a blast to play.  Just watching as your character evolves or not. Nice mix of dice rolling and card play.  definitely a game that should not be taken too seriously though but there are still good  and interesting decisions that can sway you to victory.  I would put this in the same realm as King of Tokyo.  Just silly fun.  My only real worry with this game is re-playability.  Since you use nearly all the card each game I wonder how the fun theme will hold as I can see it being a little same-y. I not sure there is enough game here to be great after you know all the cards but time will tell.

This is a pleasant little game that doesn't take much brain power. The mechanics are simple, and it gives one the feel of a more advanced "Life"-type game.  I could see someone feeling that the game would outwear its welcome since it can take around 45 minutes, but consolidating an entire life into that amount of time is a big accomplishment!  Works very well as a 2-player.

Ok, there is luck and snowballing, but the game is fast, not devoid of choices and strategy, and the theme integration is remarkably good.

update:  ...but there is a LOT of luck.  The dice are high variance.  What cards are available on your turn is random.  What secret goal is random (which are not balanced, but you'll never notice because that randomness is swamped by other randomness).

Pros: Light fun. Quite amusing. 
Cons: The box has 3X the volume needed to hold the components, taking up more space than necessary. If it were more compact, I'd throw it in my bag and bring it along more often.

RATING: 6
DO NOT PLAY with more than 2.  The downtime is horrible - there is nothing you can do on your turn, nothing to think about.  It's a light filler set collection game, kind of an engine builder but really you just try to get the best 2 cards each turn that you have a good chance at getting between what reusable tiles you already have and what you rolled on your turn (2 rerolls).  I would recommend another Yahtzee-style engine builder, Roll Through the Ages, over this one every time; even though in this game, there's not much to think about during others' turns, you are more interested in what they're doing.

RATING: 5
Nagyon tematikus játék, amit sokkal könnyedebbnek gondoltam az olvasottak alapján.
Egyszerű kockadobálós köntösbe bújtatott, erős AP veszélyes játék. Lehet meglepő, de elsőre talán kicsit nehéz átlátni a rengeteg lehetőséget.
Nekem személy szerint az ilyen típusú rajzok nem tetszenek ("ijesztőek"), habár ebben az esetben a humoruk jól átjön. Tudom ajánlani a játékot, mert nagy nevetések alakulhatnak ki, de aki irtózik a nagy szerencsefüggőségtől az kerülje el nagy ívben.
Hozzá tartozik még, hogy egy teljesen indokolatlanul mély, nagy dobozba foglal helyet és sajnos a szabálykönyve is nyitva hagy kérdéseket. Igaz, jellegéből fakadóan ezeket javasolt habkönnyűen kezelni.

Nem hinném, hogy előkerülne, a nagy AP veszély miatt. Inkább tradeltem.

Saw Rahdo's run through and bought it the next day. I like the the Yahtzee mechanic and the tableau-building. What The Game of Life should have been. I wish there was a way for more direct long-term customization of your life than picking what cards are out in a particular round.

An amusing dice chucker that the family seem to think is a step up from The Game of Life, with fun card effects that match the theme. (Although the idea that twins result in double happiness over a single child might be disputed by some.) It's light to pick up and has been fun during the initial few plays. That said, I'm already slightly bored with it. There probably isn't enough variation here, using the same small deck of cards in each game, for the game to go the distance and stay in the collection, but maybe it'll keep everyone entertained for a couple of plays a year and we'll assess if it stays around.

Purchased via Amazon, July 2015.

The BGG reviews, I think, accurately reflect the quality of this game.  It is endearing and allows for a funny narrative to emerge.  But some of the design aspects are frustrating.   It has a classic "dice-game engine" going on, without too much innovation.  Lots of studying icons, trying to figure out how to use your current cards to buy new cards, etc.  Which means that towards the end of the game, you might be spending a fair bit of time studying your dice and tokens to try to figure out which 2 cards you can afford.  It's OK, and I'll probably keep it in my collection for a while just because of the theme, art-style, and basic dice-card-tableau structure.  Good with 2 and 3, wouldn't play with 4.

Thoughts after a couple of 2P/4P games...

Looks like being a firm favourite. 

Really pleasant theme, relatively easy to teach and play (although some extra explanation of the iconography was needed). Great, humourous artwork on the cards. Love the personal/public goals to gain extra points (similar to suburbia). 

For me, wifey and friends, this kicks other 'Yahtzee' style dice rollers (I'm looking at you, Mr. Over-hyped King Of Tokyo!!) way into touch.

Looking forward to more plays.

Kártyás, kockás, egyszerű családi játék, amiben az önéletrajzunkat építjük fel. Fantasztikusan mókás grafikák a kártyákon és alig-alig egy-egy kis szöveg, szerencsére a többség piktogramokkal megoldott. A játékos dob 4 kockával és a TTA-ból megismert mechanizmusú piacról egy vagy két kártyát vesz. 4 fajta "pénz" van, van egy mosolygó jel és egy rossz szerencse jel. Ez utóbbiból három egy lapunk elvesztésével jár, a jó szerencséből három pedig egy lap ingyenes elvételére jogosít. 5+1 fajta lap van, amelyek közül 4 általában játék közben ad plusz dolgokat és 1 fajta, ami a játék végén. A +1 pedig azonnal felhasználható lap, amiből főként a játék elején kapunk. Van három jól látható cél és mindenkinek egy titkos. A játék akár 30 perc alatt is lezavarható 4-en is. Meglepően jól átjön a téma, ahogy építjük a CV-nket. Gyors, egyszerű, könnyed, családi. Nekem nagyon tetszett. Kár, hogy csak max. négyen játszható.

I love set collections and tableau building. I also don't mind the Yatzee mechanic. Admittedly there are far superior set and tableau building games (Race for the Galaxy and 7 Wonders come to mind) and also a few better Yatzee style games, but what sets this game apart is the theme of building your life (or CV) and the art. Even though I am not a fan of cartoonish art in general, the art in this game is fantastic. Also the cards are hugely thematic and their effects really make sense with what they are trying to represent.

This is a Yahtzee-mechanic game much in the same vein as King of Tokyo or Steam Park but I think I like it better than both of those.  In CV you roll dice to get symbols that allow you to acquire things for your CV (or resume for us Americans).

There's not much to say about the game play, it is quick and easy just like Yahtzee, King of Tokyo, and Steam Park but each player has a private goal which is a mechanic I'm a big fan of.  I love trying to accomplish something without telegraphing it too much while also trying to figure out your opponent's goals.  There are also public goals players are trying to achieve and other scoring opportunities.  It makes for a reasonably strategic game in a very light package.

Sure, there are the standard problems with games like this which is mostly just that luckier rollers will do better in the game but there is a neat catch-up mechanic built in where a player who is behind at the end of each of the 3 stages will get a card for free.  There are also several cards that can only be acquired by people with certain negative requirements (such as not having a job yet).

I also need to point out that the theming of this game is terrifically relevant and entertaining.  Things like having a child provide relationship and happiness symbols but also subtract one money symbol from you each turn.  Brilliant!

For a very light, accessible game this actually has a decent amount to offer to gamers.

Can't wait to play this with my kid...
Edit: Done and he was bugging me to play this after he saw it. Wow, it's really more strategic and thematic than I thought. We played it wrong with severely misunderstood rules and it was still OK. Looks like it needs to be replayed with the right rules for a more accurate rating (which should be much higher).

Edit 2: Up from 7.5 to 8 to 8.5... Totally agree with how Rahdo feels about this game. It really doesnt matter who wins because of how much fun it is.

Superb artwork and a sense of humour. Possibly 30% too long for the joke. An experience game that works with the right group - but potential for a little bit too much analysis with some. Happy to play but not too own.

'I enjoyed my one game  because Chris and Zoe are are a joy to be playing with. I love the art work. There is a lot of amusement to be had from watching your life unfold - either replicating real life or mocking it. However, even playing at speed and as an experience there are a few 2 many symbols and the game goes on 15 minutes too long for me to want to buy it. Happily play again.'

Really fun game! Lends itself to humor at the table, always a plus. The artwork looks like a cross between Tim Burton and The Far Side (good stuff). 

Hits all the right buttons: tableau building, set collecting, dice rolling, thematic narrative, etc. There is a lot to keep track of, so short bouts of AP appear normal.

Actually glad that it plays longer than other similar games, giving CV a more strategic feel. What looks to be too light of a design at first actually has more depth than one may initially realize.

Only negative is that the card stock is a little thin.

This started promisingly enough, but there is literally nothing to do between turns except watch other people roll dice and watch them think. You can't plan ahead to the cards because there's no telling what will still be there some the start of your turn - and it's not like you can actually plan for your turn since it's all dice based anyway.

In our game, one player collected all the ... green(?) cards himself and I was trying to collect all the purple cards (relationship cards). I had 5 for 15 points and he had 7 for 25 (approximately). Sadly, I bought every purple card I ever saw and literally could have done no better at collecting them, but lost because more greens came up on his turn than purples on mine. There's other stuff to talk about but that pretty much sums up my feelings on CV.

The artwork is nice though and the icons result in some fairly funny interpretations for some of the cards.

This game left me feeling flat.  I 'lived' out my life, but it was in the same way of min/maxing the cards that were good to me vs what wasn't compared to the other players that felt like there was no soul.  

And unlike other soulless games, this one takes a bit longer.

Walk through an imaginary life as you make friends and other relationships, move from job to job, stay healthy, and acquire wealth! Basically, the Game of Life, but not lame.

Luck can swing the entire game, because it's dice on top of randomly distributed cards. It's not a strategic exercise as much as it is an experience, but there are real decisions to be made, and long-term plans that can pay off.

RATING: 3
Such a huge disappointment. After watching Rahdo's video, this looked like it would be the best of the "King of Tokyo" type of dice-rolling games. A fun theme and artwork, push your luck dice rolling with set collection, hidden goals, what's not to like?

Well, I was hoping the cards would help mitigate the luck of the dice but they actually make it worse. Now not only can you get completely screwed by bad dice rolls, but you often need a certain type of card and it's just not available on your turn. Or your next turn. A player can also get pretty much eliminated with no chance of winning by about halfway through the game, but they still have to play for another 30 minutes or so. Finally, the goal cards seem to be pretty unbalanced. One person got 14 points from one goal card and won the game easily because he also met some of the open goals, whereas another player got 3 points from his goal card and no public goals, just because the right cards weren't available at the right time.

Neat idea, but I won't be playing it again.

Update: Played one more time, now lowering my rating to a 3. I would probably go lower, but like I said, I do like the theme and the artwork.
I also came to another realization about why this is so bad compared to similar games: in good push-your-luck games, there is no negative die result or it can be mitigated in some way. In CV you can get three sad faces on your first roll and now you're behind everybody else and there was nothing you could do about it. Order of the Gilded Compass, Can't Stop, Roll for the Galaxy, and King of Tokyo don't have a negative die result and those are all much more enjoyable for it. Roll Through the Ages has a negative die result but it also gives a really good positive effect so sometimes you even want to roll it. Martian Dice has a negative die result but you can fight it with your other dice. Not so in CV. Blah.

Sold.

I didn't think the rulebook was quite clear about what to do what the chips, and when you get them en when to spend them. It also became a mechanical exercise (you can't really decide your life path, there is always an optimal card you should pick for your lifegoal). The biggest problem I think is that there are not enough different cards.

A family game that mixes decent humour with simple mechanics.

The theme is great and is flawlessly implemented. The mechanics are simple and the game is easy to teach and play. The artwork is very throughtfull, and even though I personally dislike it from the art perspective, I admit it's pretty brilliant semiotically. The game has good replayability. There is luck, but your choices will win or lose the game. The paths to victory are simple yet many, and the competitive and personal goals add a bit (though not as much as they could have) to the overall experience. The sense of accomplishment is there once you finish the game, and the overall experience is further enchanced if you take pause to explain what is happening in your life based on your choices.

On the other hand, the game does have downtime, and it is a significant issue especially with 3 or 4 players. It's also quite fiddly, and it manages to be a pain to know which cards you can buy in your turn when you combine all your available resources.

Overall it's a decent game, which calls for you to play it due to its great theme and artwork, but doesn't really draw you in with its mechanics. Still, it's fun to translate your game actions to a story at the end of each game, and so the end taste is not really bitter.

About [thing=143986][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=143986][/thing] is a dice rolling game in which players are making their curriculum vitae - but in the complete sense of the words, as this is meant to be the curriculum of the entire life: relationships, knowledges, skills, properties, health, and so on.

The game flow is very simple, clean and easy: just roll some dice, use them, along side some bonus given by cards you already took earlier, to get more cards, in order to get more points, as [thing=143986][/thing] is also a set collection game: the more cards of the same type you have at the end of the game, more points will you get.

While there are several good things about the game - is cute, plays nicely, has a good amount of decisions (from rolling again, to which cards to take, considering sets and effects given), and the theme is well implemented - there are some strong issues also: there is almost zero interaction (I remember a single card that allows a player to use a symbol of someone else's job), which makes the downtime seem higher than it actually is, as there is nothing to do in the other player turns nor there is a way to have some affect into them - it is simple a matter of watching and hoping the others roll bad and worst cards appears to them, and this is simple to little to keep interest going, as there are people playing who would simple turn their attention elsewhere when their turn was over - and they didn't do any worst because of this.

Also, the replay value is questionable: the random order the cards come up, even if divided in three distinct decks, help changing the flow a little. There are also hidden and open goals, also randomly taken at the start of the game - and these make the direction of play change. Still, the overall feel and decisions are mostly the same, as the goals simply change the colors needed, and not truly the path to play or options to take. The replay value also drops since almost all the cards come up during play, but at least this helps against the next issue.

Luck is strongly present in [thing=143986][/thing]. Not truly a surprise, due to the nature of the beast. Yes, it is possible to re-roll dice, keep some, and the cards, by giving extra symbols, allowing to change symbols into others, giving more re-rolls, etc, do a great job in lowering the effect of the dice. Yet, dice are dice and will do their thing no matter what. Even more when there are one bad face: the bad luck face (properly named). The bad luck symbols give players nothing, aren't allowed to be re-rolled (normally) and exist only to bother and create some tension when deciding to re-roll. A game is like very much, [thing=37380][/thing], has a similar face on the die: the disaster. Yet, while the die with this face showing can't be re-rolled (usually) and can be bad when 2 or more appear in the same turn, the design is smarter, as the player receives 2 goods (which is very nice) per die with the disaster symbol, and 3 disasters help you by harming others. Therefore, sometimes players want to roll and get disaster symbols. This isn't true for [thing=143986][/thing], except when considering a couple of cards that allow the use of them for something positive - for 95% of the time (and 100% to some), rolling bad luck are true to the name of the symbol. To add more, there is the other way: roll three good luck faces, and you get a card for free. Yes, it is thematic: chance is part of life. Yet, in games, it seems a poor mechanic.

Overall, [thing=143986][/thing] isn't even near perfect, but it is serviceable and light enough game to decompress, get some laughs in with the character's life choices. I liked it more than my previous comments might lead one to think, since compliments most readers accept outright while criticism must the explain exhaustively.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
At the start every player receives one hidden goal (something that will give extra points at the end of the game), and one or more goals will be open - these will also score at the end of game, but only for the player that best met the conditions in each of them. Them every player receives 3 childhood cards, and there is a draft round, in which players pick one card and pass the others, until everyone again has 3 cards. These are always event cards, except the Bicycle, which is a property and marks the first player.

In her turn the player rolls from 4 to 7 dice (4 is the norm, but some cards give more). After the initial roll, the player can set aside symbols she wants to keep, and roll again the others, except dice showing the bad luck symbol, which can't be re-rolled. Again, after the second roll, the player can keep some, and roll the others - even rolling one or more of the previously set aside. After the third roll, usually there won't be more re-rolls allowed (some cards can change this).

Once the rolls are done, the player can buy cards - up to two. Cards are bought by spending symbols/dice to take them, adding the cards to the player's tableau or to the players hand (if they are event cards), to be used later. Some type of cards (like jobs), are always put in front, being active, while others (like relationships, health, etc), when taken can be put behind other of the same type, meaning the previously card will remain active, while the new will just add to final scoring.

If the player rolls three good luck symbols, she can take one card of the row for free. If the players rolls three bad luck synmbols, she must lose one active card.

After the player is done buying, new cards are drawn from the appropriated deck (early adulthood, middle age or old age) and added to the row. Once the plays return to the first player, the leftmost card is taken out. When each of the first two decks end, players check to see in anyone has less than half the amount of cards in the tableau then the player with the most cards - if this happens, the players that have less than half, can take one card from the row for free.

Play proceeds this way until the Old Age deck has less cards than the number of players - when this happens, the game is over. Players will reveal their hidden goals, and score for them, check also who will take the open goals and score for them, and, finally, score for the set of cards in the tableaus. The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
What dice to re-roll. When to use the Event cards (normally, given by the situation). The most important and pressing of the decisions is which cards to buy, considering the sets (more of a kind are worth more in the end), the effects they grant and the cards in the sets of the other players. Still, many times you will just buy what you can.

There is the decision of which card to keep active, as some types allow this, and since most of the cards have nice effects, this decision carries some weight, but not all that much, as, again, most of the cards will be good one way or the other.

Overall, [thing=143986][/thing] presents light decision-making.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Good graphic design and art;
- Theme works very well and is nicely thoughtout in the cards and goals;
- A good level of humor, not enough to be the drive force in the game (as it would surely get old fast), but is there to be appreciated;
- Easy to teach and to play;
- It plays well (as is likely best) with 2 players;
- Language independant;
- Several (light) decisions to be made throughout.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Almost zero interaction between players going further then taking what someone next might want;
- As there is nothing to be between rounds, there can be some downtime issues;
- Luck (both bad or good) can decide the game;
- Replay value could be an issue.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
As if life is a lot simpler - simple, achievable goals, much easier to get a job and find friends; even work out isn't as dull. Yet, board game design won't ever give you money - so sad. Chance can still harm or help, and you are likely to believe that it has something against you. Regardless of this, you will probably follow a nice path to a relaxing retirement in a private castle, owning a factory, having money, friends and a good health. It is the dream, dude.

[thing=143986][/thing] strikes many positive notes, and the theme being the best of all for me, from the a child giving happiness and a relationship, but costing money, to the trip around the world allowing you to see the bad luck as a bump to better things. All is in place, and I can only admire the work to make all this seamless and working completely with the mechanics. Of course, much of the humor in the game derives from here, so is clear the importance of it to the whole process.

It also plays well enough, even more with 2 players (as it plays faster and there is more control), which is a big draw for many. Yet, the issues I had with it will prevent me from going much after it. It will fit best for occasional play, not only to keep the fun fresh, but also because the mechanics can bother (due to the luck factor and almost zero interaction). [thing=143986][/thing] could be a true winner, however it doesn't reach greatness, just adequateness.

I like what it tries to do, but it has serious execution problems. It's much too random. The dice randomness is not even the major problem (though it's not great); the card randomness is. It's possible to go many turns without even having a possibility of buying a particular color card. (And the fact that an extra card is flushed before the start player's turn is ridiculous.)

I might try tweaking it except that I already have The Game of Life Card Game, which does what this is trying to do, but better. That game is not spectacular, but it has much more control despite still having a fair amount of randomness. It's also faster. The only advantage CV has is the art.

I love the theme of the game! Unfortunately, the game play was not that interesting. I felt it was quite random and reading/processing the symbols was somehow a bit too difficult for such a simple game --> can lead to slow game play and AP. I feel also that the theme was (mostly) pasted on - I think there would be more you could do with this theme...

Played the prototype and now finally the finished game.  Glad to see that some things got cleared up before the game went into production.

This is a very tentative rating.  I enjoy dice games like this, but I worry about this one inducing AP even with players who don't normally have it.  The issue is the number of icons you have during any single turn and then figuring out how to use them.  Maybe this will get better with more plays.  Also not sure about replay ability.  Really love the concept, however.

Enjoyable enough, but bogs down and takes far too long for a push-your-luck dice game.  Tells a bit of a fun story that'll develop differently each time which is kinda neat.

Overall though, not much reason to play this when you can play something that goes twice as fast with similar depth like Roll Through the Ages.  Also does nothing to change my mind on the topic of hidden goals being a terrible mechanic.

Rolling dice dice to create amusing stories, while very much staying a competitive game. I just love the artwork. I've played with people who complained of downtime, but I think it's a matter of attitude:if on your fellow players' turns you pay attention to their lifestory, suggest choices (for their benefit or your own) and/or commiserate with them for their bad luck, then you can feel continuously engaged. Nonetheless, three players probably better than four.

RATING: 6.5
Good theme but lacks in gameplay. Basically you just grab what you can with some minor choices. However, these choices might be sufficient if the game lasted only 30 minutes, but the game lasts at least 2-3 times as long if you intend to make any decisions and not just roll the dice and buy mindlessly. Too bad, I was actually looking forward to this.

I dislike this game a lot - mostly because there isn't that  much you can actually do - it's like playing solitaire. There's nearly no interaction between players (expansion supposed to solve this problem - it didn't). After few plays it feels like mechanics are broken - there's snowball effect: if you're rich you get richer every turn. Thanks to no interaction u cant stop rich people from getting richer and after a few first rounds u can already tell whos gonna win. What i liked was great art - not every board game theme could use those but here it fit perfectly.

I give it "Game with Great Art ruined by no Interaction Badge!"

RATING: 10
Outstanding! A theme with wide appeal, fantastic artwork and a clever sense of humor.

The theme really is rock solid with just about every card being a clever and often satirical reflection on real life experiences.

Easy to teach due a rules structure that is extremely simple at its core, with some added complexity once the cards come out. You can play "friendly"with hands open and help new players with choosing dice and cards. Typically after 1 play most can play comfortably without much help.

Despite family weight this has a surprisingly good amount of depth to strategic decisions. The cards combine in interesting and unique ways keeping the game fresh across plays. Winning involves elements of risk management, tableau management, drafting, set collection with multiple paths to victory available.

Dice have minimal impact with a decent catch-up mechanic that is especially effective for compensating against early bad luck. As the game goes on the dice matter less if you choose to mitigate their impact or more if you choose a riskier build. Generally the best player will win 90% of the time, but little bits of luck can give other players a chance to win which I really like.

All in all highly recommended, this game is great as a gateway that will still engage experienced gamers.

Nice theme on top of bland mechanics: dice rolling and set collection. If you have really bad luck and keep yhatzeeing it up with frowning faces, you will have to sit through a long time of losing badly, which sucks. If it was shorter, maybe I wouldn't find it as objectionable.

CV is a dice/card game similar to games like To Court the King, where you're trying to improve your odds for future rolls so you can add control to how you roll the dice.  This is a larger game than TCtK, and isn't as prone to having scripted play as that game, and I like the way it comes together.  There's no confrontation in the game, outside of taking a card before someone else can, but the system does force you to constantly change up your engine, since you can only have one active card of any given color.  I'd definitely play this one again.

CV is yet another entry into the Yahtzee style push-your-luck dice game category. Thankfully, it also tacks on some light engine building and card drafting, making it more interesting than most. It's biggest achievement is in story telling, as thematically justifying how all of the drafted cards fit together to describe your avatar's life is more fun than the actual turn to turn gameplay.

My only complaint is that I think some of the funnier stories are almost scripted, since there aren't nearly enough cards to make every play unique. This game needs a Phil Eklund style set-up, such as a 200 card deck in which you only use a quarter of the cards each game, chosen completely at random. As it is, I suspect that after about 5-10 plays you will have seen every funny situation the game can generate. Unless they expand it, this game is going to flame out pretty fast, which is a shame, since it does have those fun story-telling moments between turns.

In CV players are rolling dice with different symbols, and can buy cards depending on what comes up. The cards up for sale represents jobs, friends, properties, relationships, so in effect your are creating the story of your life. Most cards are very intuitive and the abilities fit the theme well.

Though not very complicated, this game's best feature is the artwork on the cards; very creative and humorous!

If you just play through this game without doing anything extra to spice it up, it is just an okay game. However, after reading / watching some people play through CV, my wife and I decided to adopt the house rule that requires you to create a story arc explaining what led you to pick the cards you did.

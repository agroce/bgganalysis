Gave this a play but I don't think it's deep enough for a war game. If I have 2 players, we're going to play Combat Commander or something of that weight. Also, my wife wanted to kill me when I brought this home!

This looks great, but the rules are so bad and the game just does not look right or feel like tactical combat at all. Might use the figures with the Stargrunt rules.

The boys got this for Christmas.  Still feeling our way through the rules.  They must have played 10 times against each other, but I used the number of 'sessions' they played as number of plays.  I have a bit of a concern about Laser guns and their power in relation to how well my younger son roles dice...Give him a second chance, say goodbye to your army...

RATING: 10
I have spent much time to find a easy, fun, good looking tabletop game.

I tried really much over the years. Warhammer Fantasy, Warhammer 40k, Bolt Action, Fields of Glory, Songs of Blades and Hereos, Warlords, Full Trust, Star Wars: X-Wing, Wings Of War..

At the end I only found two, which are not too expensive and which I can always play with someone who has no experience with table tops.

Deadzone and Dust Tactics.

Even one of my friend who only owned one boardgame before, started to collect his own Army after the first Dust Tactics evening.

Dust Tactics:

+ high quality models
+ models are ready to play, you even don't need to paint thm
+ cheap price compared to similar games
+ all information you need are on unit cards
+ 3 options to play: Battlefield (without map grid), Tactics (with map grid) or alternative Warfare rules (also no grid, but seperate rules)
+ you can learn and teach it in under 1 hours, all unit special rules are on the unit cards.

Beside of that, if you prefer dogfights, Star Wars: X-Wings and Wings Of Glory are also good table tops.

First of all, the miniatures in this are great. They could be worth the "price of admission" right off the bat if you like minis. But the game is bland and lacks meaningful choices. It *is* however a reasonably good start that could go places with expansions.

pure wishlist material if I have one out there! The game looks fantastic and I will manage a play somewhen, and then I will make up my mind. My biggest hurdle is finding regular players of what looks to be an incredible little minis slugfest! I'll be sure to keep on top of this one if I get to play it or get it in house!

I resisted this game for awhile, but finally caved and spent a bundle. Really enjoying the system.

Update: Just getting into Dust Warfare and Dust Tactics/Battlefield Version 2 so we'll see if the rating is impacted.

Update: Lowering my rating as there has simply been too much rules churn since the game was released without the needed support from the publisher.

A very fun game that plays quickly and cuts out a lot of ambiguity and extra die rolls.  The rules are pretty tight.  The games and fast and interesting.  Background is compelling and art work is good.  The models are really nice.  The scenario packs are also interesting, although some scenarios could use more play-testing for balance.  One of my favorites.

Amazing components, great theme and great diversity in unit stats/ability's. This game is all about skirmishing. A typical scenario takes about 20 minutes which is a great plus point for me. Game play is pretty straightforward but not a problem for the Ameritrash admirers. If you like mini's and skirmish games this game is a must buy for you.

Dust Tactics is great! Wargame Lite without a lot of complicated rules. YMMV whether you like the LOS rules or not. I'm OK with it. Anything to simplify the game :)
Hardcore wargamers/grognards will probably NOT like this one. Too simple. But I've decided more time playing and less time looking up rules and charts is the way for me.

I'm keeping to Tactics V1.

Since BattleFront took over, i don't like the changes they put into the game. Tactics was a simple game that suited me just fine and it's replaced by a more complex - but not more fun - game.

Tactics V1 = 8/10
Tactics V2 = 5/10

This game is a brilliant mix of boardgame and tabletop game, taking the best of both worlds and making an intense experience that captures the flavour of action films, but at a cost of strategic depth.

This, the original core set, comes in a large box packed with content that's worth considerably more than its selling price. It's a bit hard to find, these days, however.

In the spectrum between a tabletop miniatures game and a hex-and-counter wargame, this one is in a blurry grey area that is awful close to a tabletop minis.

The dice conventions are dumb and the abstractions do not go nearly far enough. Way too much crap is in this game instead of on the editing room floor. Great minis though, and some of the ideas could be hopefully used in future boardagmes.

Recently I've gone a little nuts on this game -- scratches the wargame itch without being too complicated. It's a fast playing, buckets o' dice game that usually is over in about 45 minutes. I'm a little concerned there isn't enough "there" there to keep it interesting, but I do like that the scenarios keep things fresh.

I like this game fine, although I feel the following lessens the gameplay for me.

1. There can be a huge unbalance in the qty of dices being chucked between units. Some units will chuck 20+ dices, while other will have 5. 

2. I don't like the unit size, I'd prefer if the models functioned as individuals vs units of 3-6 models.

Bought for Dust Warfare miniatures. I didn't care to much for v1 but the newer version 2 makes this game 'gamier' and more fun for a throw lots of dice game. The bigger movements and dice count probably reduce the tactical component of Tactics but it does add to the fun. If I want serious gaming I'll bust out Warfare, for a quick bit of fun with the same models I'll play Tactics (or more likely Battlefield)

RATING: 10
Rating based on V1 of the rules, and the game up to the point where it was no longer being run by FFG.  I enjoy what I have and love it, but am not a fan of the direction it's taken once Battlefront took it over, and now that Dust Studios just runs it on its own, and at this point have no plans on buying anything else in the system.  I have all Axis and Allied units released by FFG however.

It's a tactical wargame, and my wife likes it and is quite good at it.  That in itself makes the game worthy of a 10.

There are lots of reasons this game is great though:

Quick set up time
Awesome miniatures
Plays fast and furious
Quite a few meaningful decisions each game, considering how short and dicey it is.
Good mix of luck vs tactics
Beautiful components.
Massive Robots.

Amazing game.  The figures in the base version are amazing and only look better in the Deluxe edition. However the Base version could be played and used and no one I think would ever complain.  The army men could be painted but the walkers in the base are amazin even before extra paint jobs.

The gameplay is as good and clean as the visuals too.  Great game. hands down my favorite game at Gen Con

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
[i]Sept 2011:[/i] First Impressions.
+ Fantastic sculpts and illustrations! Miniatures are assembled and primed 
+ Ready to play out of the box. Set up time wasn't as bad as I thought; Grid movement  and works well in play
+ Fast play that rewards good tactics and strategy and is punishing to those who are reckless
+ There's a whole lot of fun and replayability in the original core set. Expansions add to the game but are not required to enjoy what comes out of the box
+ Great theme. Then again I'm a sucker for alternate WW II.

#High price point for original core set may turn off many (I know it turned me off for a long time). However, note that buying the miniatures separately the set would cost you twice as much. 
#A step up from Memoir '44 in terms of complexity.

- Rules were not clear in several areas. Had to search for  answers, consult the forums and living FAQ, etc.
- Some of the flavour text, especially the dialogue was horrible; Something was definitely lost in translation here.
- Vehicle bits are fragile; a couple of pieces broke off during transport and was afraid the others would break during assembly

Assembly of the tanks is fiddly. Dainty. Especially the US tank machine guns and spot lights. I had to glue them  on as they would not "snap" into place. The turrets for the US tanks just sit on top and want to fall off when moving. I'll probably have to glue them on sooner or later. They are so fragile that storing them back in the box is an impossibility. The 9 pieces of game board slide around. I need to get something to secure them into place. This overall experience almost makes me dread the release of future expansions.

Dust Tactics collection for sale or trade. Buy it all, or make an offer on 1 of 3 near-complete factions.

• If you live near Kansas, pickup is an option

All boxes, minis, manuals, books, cards, and Operation expansions included for 3 factions (Allies, Axis, SSU). Each faction is ~90% complete, with few duplicates. In  excellent condition. Most walker models have been magnetized. Additional magnets included. Laser line for sighting. Two Gale Force 9 tape measures for movement.

Takes up about the space of 10 copier paper boxes, which includes 6 Plano cases for storage.

RATING: 7
If you're going to make a low complexity 'roll dice & remove models' kind of game, it might as well be easy to set up and have some colorful units.  Dust Tactics succeeds at that side of things and for that reason alone, it's a decent addition to the hobby.  I don't love the game (which often feels too shallow and some of the scenarios bark), but I do find it an easy diversion to set up and knock out a few scenarios with.  

The most natural comparison would be to AT-43 - Dust isn't anywhere near as pretty a game or as inventive a setting and it's missing the activation subsystem which made AT-43 so interesting to play - but Dust is also missing all the really weird rules decisions which dragged AT-43 down (grounding, template weapons generally, automatic hits/wounds) and that gives it a real leg up as a tabletop experience.

Super detailed and beautiful miniatures but the few people I got to try this one were all left saying "That's It?".  For a game with such detailed miniatures it was too light.  It did mostly have that feeling of just marching everything at the other side and seeing what happens.  As someone who has played many a wargame both light and very heavy it just lacked that one special thing that would have made it a keeper.  I seem to have liked it more than anyone else I'd encountered though.

RATING: 10
For some reason it reminds me of Claustrophobia's easy set up, and simple, yet complex enough ruleset to let play exciting and quick battles without consulting constantly with the rulebook. If you don't mind the overused AlterNazi History theme (I certainly don't), you will love the beautiful, highly detailed miniatures. The quality of the minis easily justifies the pricepoint, the game is fun to play, excellent over all.
My only concern is, that the base set contains just the bare minimum of armies, and let's hope it lives long enough to see at least its two or three expansions of the promised five. The fun part should be the army building, but when the second scenario calls to choose 16 AP worth of army, and the box contains 16 AP worth of army, then it doesn't require too much creativity, does it? It's full of potential, let's hope for the best.

Update: All right, so it's taken over by FFG from AEG, which is a curse and a blessing at the same time. FFG constantly churns out new stuff at a mindblowing speed, but converted it into its regular money-sink format, ripping the boxes apart completely, and selling it almost by separate molecules. However the game remained the awesome low-fuss, ultra intense squad miniature game on a tight grid as it was, improved beyond that even, and this way I'm not forced to buy the utterly silly stuff at least. Yep, I know, it's a little weird coming from someone who doesn't consider giant walking tanks utterly silly, but still. Trained gorillas, and the Swedish Chef with flamethrowers?? No, thank you very much.

[COLOR=#FF3300]1st edition, 1.5th Edition, 2nd Edition and now it looks like it will have a 3rd edition... A great game produced by a company that seems to be set on a mission making a clusterfuck mess of itself.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#0033FF]Have: Mainly Allies & SSU, but there's a reasonable number of Axis as well.[/COLOR]

I have always wanted to have one miniatures game, but was afraid that it would be complicated, lengthy, and I wouldn't be able to get anyone to play. Dust Tactics, however, is free from such inconveniences - its gameplay is fast and furious, the rules are really simple (even too simple at times, so I've introduced a few upgrades), and the overall experience is simply awesome. Not to mention the visual appeal, which I have enhanced by adding 3d terrain. Still, once I finish painting the minis, it will be the best-looking game that I have. Overall, I think it's destined to become an evergreen classic and truly a crown jewel of my collection.

Great miniatures, interesting story and world, would be a 10 but things die abit too quick for me. If im spending alot of money on extra miniatures and time painting them would at least be nice to have some kind of save that does not always involve cover.

Got a hands on look at box contents and basic demo of rules. The miniatures are fantastic, the rules not so much. See this as similar to AT-43, a light,disposable wargame that's fun to play but only on occasion. Would love to see this develop away from the grid play to an open table top.Between Dust & now Dust Tactics my experience has been this universe oozes style but overall lacks substance. Will still keep an eye on this to see how it develops. Update 07/'11- Just announced Dust Wars(open table top rules) may be the incentive I need to invest in this

I own quite a bit of Dust stuff (not itemized in my collection) and have quite a bit more on the way from the recent Kick Starter. This is a relatively straight forward miniatures game and the new Dust Tactics: Battlefield rules have elevated this from good to great!

RATING: 5.5
Simple/simplistic skirmish game with lovely miniatures -- far better quality than is typical from a boardgame publisher -- but rather uninspiring gameplay. The line-of-sight and movement-measurement issues common to the genre are avoided by using a grid system: each squad must be contained wholly within a grid square; movement is a simple n squares and LOS is determined by drawing a line from the centre of the firing unit's square to the centre of the target's.

I don't like tactical skirmish games as a rule and this one is no exception, but the simplicity of the rules here was an attractively low barrier to entry. It's certainly more accessible than something like Warhammer 40,000 and is a better choice for younger players for that reason. Unfortunately, that same simplicity translates directly into a lack of anything remotely interesting in the gameplay.

Rating after two plays. Rules are simple and well conceived and gameplay is quite fun, but maybe the game lacks a little depth, perhaps because of high lethality.
Materials are high-quality, the mechs in particular are top-notch (German ones are astounding) though maybe a little fragile for a game of this kind.

After a couple of plays, I would rate this game (incl expansions) a 6, and its artwork/components a 9. Love the miniatures (which I do not intend to paint btw), the quick setup time, the short playing time and the relatively easy rules. The high fatality (an attacking unit usually manages to eliminate an entire enemy unit in a single round), however, does make it a bit more luck heavy than I would prefer. It also makes the start of the game a little chess-like, looking for an opening to attack before being attacked (and being wiped out). Gameplay will probably improve with announced units who can cover more distance in a turn, snipe and/or jump over obstacles.
UPDATE: Purchased some additional units and a scenario pack, but I am unsure whether these increase the enjoyment I get out of the game. Each expansion comes with extra rules and/or new special abilities, and make it harder to keep track of all that is happening on the battlefield.

A very fun game to play with your buddies! The rules are simple and battles resolve quickly. The miniatures are simply beautiful. A good intro to wargaming for beginners too. Expansions for the game are coming out at a steady pace which is good for those of us who have invest quite a bit on Dust Tactics which is not a cheap game. This ensures our investment are still current and hopefully Dust Tactics will continue to grow for many years to come. My only gripe about this game is that there is not enough materials about the Dust universe. More sourcebooks and scenario books are definitely welcome. Other than that, I am enjoying this game alot with my gaming buddies.

Man, when the box came i said, What the Hell? This is a monster box! And when i opened it... it was magical, the miniatures were beautiful, perfect.... their heads and torso move, each one is different.... the war machines are... they are.... there are no words.... Apart from my absolute passion for these miniaures, the game is AWESOME! Simple mechanics but really strategic game. Fast,  but dont go running for the battle or you're gonna lose, think about every move first.

Dust Tactics is a tactical miniatures board game for 2-4 players. In an alternate 1940s reality, alien technology fuels gigantic machines of war as the forces of the Axis and Allies clash over rare mineral deposits that could inevitably decide the outcome of the war. With over 30 highly detailed miniatures, 9 double-sided terrain boards, 12 custom dice, unit cards, terrain, and plastic scenery, Dust Tactics delivers everything you need to wage battles in the immersive world of Dust.

A deep and engaging game setting, featuring stunning artwork by Paolo Parente, will draw players in to a
world desperately at war... and the highly detailed miniatures only add to this immersion. Eight included scenarios and nearly limitless customization ensures hundreds of hours of replayability, while scalable rules offer a satisfying experience for players of all levels.

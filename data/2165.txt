Played this with my younger brother when it came out. Personally, I found the way energy cards work annoying (though I understand that you have to do weird stuff like that to make a CGG work). I'm not a fan of the theme or the culture, and I think the game is a bit too juvenile for me to enjoy.

The mechanism itself is reasonably interesting, but the card balance is too poor.  The game strongly favors certain powerful rare cards, and this makes the strategy monotonous.

A fairly simplistic CCG, but the kids like it.

RATING: 5
Play a Pokemon and power him up with card energies. Than hit your opponent till he goes down. 

Standard Magic card type of game. The mechanic remains restricted by the type of cards and their draws. Did not like he idea of a creature getting stronger he longer he stays out there alive.

Limited by the CCG releases and card text usefulness.

Nothing to shout about.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Actally not that bad of a game. Collected and "played" when I was younger but gave away all my cards. Then I bought a few cards second hand and played with, and I actually like the game. Easy filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good learning environment to teach some of the basics of CCGs. There are certainly worse games out there and my kids are excited to learn to play. At least I can control the volume of cards they use so it's not that expensive. Not a bad game really if you view it just as a standard game and ignore the collectable aspect of it.

If you are an adult and have never played this game, give it a try. I think it may surprise you.

The game mechanics are excellent but it has a poor target audience. 90% of the target age group it was focused at propably never really learned the proper rules as it's above thier learning curve so they just rated it a bad game. On the other hand, it has good game play for adults but may not be for everyone due to a childish theme. If your an adult that doesn't mind "cute" games, this one might fit well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Surprisingly enjoyable TCG, it has some depth to it. The only issue really is that it can really depend on the luck of the draw unfortunately (the first few hands are crucial), perhaps to an even higher degree than most famous TCG's.

I gave it 9 ten years ago. I loved Pokemon. New player understood well. Today,many effects are coming like MTG. The simple rules had broken. Where are U going,Pokemon? I can't understand. The kids love Pockemon...But they can not play Pockemon Card. They can't understand that boring effects.

The game is actually a lot of fun, if you can get the decent cards for either format. As the game is now published by Nintendo; there really hasn't been much in the way of degradation of the rules in comparison, with the advent of Ruby/Sapphire. With the events from Nintendo being run, the only problem is the lack of locations. As an old player, I do have enougn cards for several decks. At times, some variations would be difficult; but aren't at all hard. Even if one starts off with only a single starter deck, they can have a chance to win without spending an arm and a leg on singles.

Pokemon TCG is a kid's game, with the usual collectible marketing method behind.
The game is surprisingly fun the first times you play and start to explore it, and has so e depth I didn't suspect at first glance.
Of course nothing can compete with the king, Magic The Gathering...

RATING: 6
yes, I know, MTG got 1 from me, and this gets a 6. can't help it - I blame MTG for half the world's evil, while this is a cool little game to play with my daughter, with mechanics sound enough I feel a little bit like being back into MTG land. We've got a ton of cards for E20, and I haven't seen the worst of the collectible aspect at all at my daughter's school. getting to know it for the first time 8 years after it's release might have helped :-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's all about the theme -- if you like Pokémon, you should enjoy this fun, extensively-supported card game; if you don't, you can probably find more compelling TCG's. Serves well as a filler game, as you can choose how many "prizes" to play for, which allows you to adjust game length as desired. It also works well for competitive solo play, not being heavily dependent on hidden information. One of the simpler, less cumbersome options in this genre -- Vaporeon, I choose YOU!

RATING: 10
Not popular by those with a stigma against Pokemon, but for those of us who grew up with the craze (like myself) or those who don't mind being picked on, this game is a real blast.  The strategy and depth of the deck customization is nearly endless.  No matter your age, this game has superb mechanics.

It's Pokémon.  How can a game that has have a huge following for over 20 years not be rated 10?  I played and enjoy the board game, video game, and cartoon series as a kid, and now my own children enjoys it as well.  The same goes with age-old favorites like Chess, Checkers, and Battleship.

My young boy was really getting into the trading aspect of this game, so I caved and bought a basic starter deck to see what the fuss was all about (and to play with him!). Actually not a bad little game, as long as one doesn't get too serious about the collecting aspect of it.

So I've come back to a TCG, driven by some friends that were looking to become Pokemon teachers (both TCG and videogame). After trying the game online I realized I was looking for something similar to this game for some time (Short, Fast, Having a central card/character you can improve, and so on) so I went ahead and started playing

It's a good game, but again the pitfals of a TCG (gotta keep buying to stay current, be competitive, and so on) have driven me away

RATING: 5
(KIDS) Perhaps this game gets better as more cards come into the game.  My son has enjoyed it a lot, but mostly because it is a hot topic of conversation at school.  The fact is that players often end up in trapped situations.  And, one side can easily end up at a disadvantage based on which colors you are playing.  For me, it's just not worth playing unless my kid enjoys it enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Believe it or not I hadn't played this game until recently when my Son became interested. I bought a couple of decks of XY and we played against each other. I can see the attraction. It is easy to learn and quite strategic. I do enjoy a battle now and again.

This was probably my gateway game into gaming.  My daughter picked up two starter decks at a Wallgreens while we were on vacation and we played it whenever there was down time.  It was really fun.  She has since built multiple decks, started our whole family into the game and all her friends into Pokemon card trading.

I still play with my original store bought deck...and I can't compete anymore with her deck that she builds with the newest cards.  My wife and son keep a strong deck and play with her a lot. But I have lost interest in constantly buying new cards just to play the game competitively.  

It has been years and they still ask for boosters during gift time...I am happy to oblige, but I am not encouraging it either.  They have fun, so money well spent I suppose.

Putting the omnipresent complaints about the TCG model aside...

A pretty fun card game, although I feel like the momentum of this game usually ends up getting decided pretty early. My pokemon was knocked out? I'll probably lose the match.

This would be much more appreciated as a LCG, like, every card game.

Enjoyable CCG I play with my daughter. She's had cards for a while but with getting a bit older, and a renewed interest in Pokemon thanks to Pokemon Go, we've gone through the rules and started playing for real. 

Fun, but this has the same problem I had with Magic: huge variation in card powers driving you to spend more to get better cards. Would not want to do any kind of competitive play, but definitely fun playing with the kid.

RATING: 1
If <u>MtG</u> is an evil capitalist soul-destroying waste of money, then <u>Pokemon</u> is its even more evil twin brother. I would give this game a ZERO if I could. I have seen children bankrupt their parents in order to buy more rancid pieces of paper. There is no game I despise more, if for no other reason than its corruption of the young and impressionable. The <u>Pokemon</u> CCG is the work of the Devil and the diabolists who perpetrate it should be castrated so they never have children of their own. Was that a savage enough judgment? (Oh, and, it's also a terrible game.)

   I resisted adding this to my collection for the longest time, but it seems this game just isn't going anywhere.  My son started playing this in earnest by the age of 4 (he learned to read very early) & his interest has yet to diminish.

Pokemon was basically "everything" in my school in 4th-6th grade or so. Everybody had them and it was awesome to play and trade; I have great memories about Pokemon cards! I actually still own some cards for nostalgic reasons. However, even though the game was fine at that time when I didn't really know about games, nowadays I would prefer so many other 2 player games.

I play this with my younger son, who is really into Pokémon right now. There’s some good Card play in this. I haven’t fully dived into all that is out there, just have a basics starter deck. So far, there seems to be too much riding on flipping a coin to call it great.

To my shame, I briefly owned a deck and played it a few times as a freshman in high school. I quickly gave the cards away, I think. Only purpose of this game, to my mind, is to introduce younger kids (8+) to a TCG before introducing them to MTG (recommended for ages 12+, though I was only 10 when I started). But then you risk the kid becoming hooked on Pokémon and not wanting to switch!

RATING: 6
Recently re-discovered (after enjoying the base game waaaaay back in 1999), the elegant simplicity of the game whilst still requiring careful tactical consideration makes this a wonderful deck builder.  The extremely broad range of cards (and abilities) now present provides an incredibly deep experience, and I do like the recently added energy types. Perhaps a touch too few 'silly' creatures, and the power creep is rather evident, but they can be easily subsituted given the vast range available. 

Nostalgia does play an inherent part in my enjoyment, no doubt, but the game is quick, easy to play, and is highly thematic - it is incredible how much of the core videogame concept is captured by the TCG model, especially with the very different movesets offered by variants of  creatures - really allowing for a more personal feeling of development. And the excitement of opening booster packs is... oddly fun!

Primary deck: a Porygon-centric/Fighting, titled 'Digital Trolls'.

My younger daughters love this game.  I'm generally not fond of CCGs, and this one isn't really an excpetion to that.  You trot out your pokemon and begin attacking the other player's pokemon.  Most of the choices consist of when to withdraw after you pokemon has taken damage, what sort of pokemons to attack with, etc.  I do really like the two player trainer decks.  They eliminate deck building, which would really be tricky for younger kids.  So far, we have only played with the pre-made decks.

Looking for offers of a full USPS fixed-price box of cards. This would be approximately 2,800 - 3,000 cards. Offered lots need to include at least 185 Rares.

Only interested in cards from the following sets: Neo-Genesis and sets more recent than NG. 

Can be combined with cards from other titles in which I am interested to get a full box (but should still have an appropriate mix of Rare cards). 

Not really interested in this one until the boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins (but wanted to go ahead and add it to my list so that I do not forget) and I can obtain in bulk. Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).

Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 5:1 (5 Pokemon for 1 MtG).

I will not play it again but that's due to it being far from what it was originally back when only Gen 1 and 2 cards were around. Not a fan of Pokemon anymore by any stretch but like all CCGs that break the magic clone mold it gets a big dollop of bonus points for that alone.

On the first play I found a typo on a card. Some of the cards seemed to be clearly much more powerful than others (and I'm sure they are..and also more rare and more expensive to obtain). This is the crux of what I don't like about this genre.

We managed to make two decks that seem reasonably balanced. The game play was "OK". We've played a lot of 2p games, and we've had a lot more fun than this. 

The only real positive in my eyes was that my son was interested in reading all the cards and making his own deck.

Gave in to the Pokemon craze when I was 11... I used to love this game and have great memories playing it and trading rare cards with my friends. I still have my decks, buried somewhere in my closet, but I don't think I'll ever play this game again.

My kids have loved Pokemon for years.  After playing it over and over with them, I burned out on it, but I'm still willing to play from time to time.

RATING: 5
Cute CCG with solid mechanics. Much too simplistic for people who have played heavier games such as Magic (i.e.: me) but there are worse games out there, especially for the target market. The biggest benefit I can see to the game at this point is that the cards are easy to pick up inexpensively.

The game has some grossly over-powered cards at high commonality slots (i.e.: Tutor effects which allow you to find specific cards from your deck) but given that this is the type of game that you're probably going to be playing casually with your kids, it is not difficult to winnow the broken stuff out of the mix.

Pretty good thematic implementation. Stick with the first set or two for maximum cheapness...it contains all of the core Pokemon characters anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Likes: Childhood nostalgia.

Dislikes: Was costly when it first came out and now there's way too many pokemon to keep up with. The pokemon usually have only 1 or 2 abilities, which doesn't reflect the 4 that they can have in the video game.

Oct 2015 - The kids really love the detail and story of the cards themselves probably more than the game. The deckbuilding is very interesting for them and the game itself helps with their maths. Not bad, but still fairly luck based. It is very easy to get crueled by an unlucky draw.

My 7 y.o. rates this game a 10.  We recently discovered a Pokemon league at our FLGS where he attended his first session and had a great time.  I've been playing with my son and have found this to be a surprisingly good game.  A bit too much luck involved with the draw of the cards (and the coin flip - I probably flipped 2 heads and 10 tails), but overall a very good game for kids.
At home we play that you can use a d6 rather than the coin flip -- even numbers = heads, odd numbers = tails.

Found a starter deck on clearance for $0.99.  Tried it out with my 4 year old son to see what all the hub-bub was about.  

Initially, I couldn't really see spending more money on cards, but my now 7 year old really likes the game so we bought some pre-made decks.  That makes all the difference.  I really enjoy the game now, there is much more in the strategy than one might think.  The characters are definitely weird, but they have interesting attacks and I really enjoy the game!

RATING: 4
Yeah, that's right. Pokemon. Stop laughing! I recieved several cards and a VHS tape from Nintendo before the card game was released in the US. It sparked my interest and I bought a starter and a couple boosters when it came out in stores. I liked the game back then, but it VERY quickly suffered the same problems of MTG. It was fun for a couple sessions, but got old pretty quick.

RATING: 4
Way too random to be considered a good strategy game. I suppose it's good for kids who are fans of Pokemon, but as a game, it's not that great. It's a step of complexity below Magic: The Gathering, so more accessible to youngsters, who also would enjoy the artwork and theme. 

Production quality is severely lacking. The rulebook is a single page, folded up into a small rectangle, making referencing it a pain. The "wound" markers are super thin cardboard, making them a pain to handle. God help you if you drop one on the floor.

RATING: 6
For an adult the theme/subject matter is lame, however the game itself, and the deck building aspect, is pretty good. Having been pestered to play by my kids I actually used to enjoy playing it and you could do worse than using this as a means to enthuse your kids into the world of gaming generally. It introduces the concepts of strategy, tactics, rule reading and some simple maths.

The collectable aspect is, as always, somewhat regrettable but it's easy and cheap enough to get enough cards to play a reasonable game and do some deck building.

I got this game as a request from my son who is a big Pokemon fan. I have tons of fun playing with him. He has beaten me countless times with great combination of cards. It may not be as deep as MTG or Android:Netrunner, but the fun I have with my son beats any shortcomings of this game. Highly recommend any parent that his son/daughter shows Pokemon interest to go to the store and grab a startup kit.

Another game which is probably not the best from a true "game" standpoint. But it was my introduction to TCGs, and the memories of opening up booster packs to hope for a Charizard in the late 90's will always warm my heart. I framed my original trio + evos for my wall in a place of honor. Definite power creep in this game, and sadly, in your 20's, you get looked down upon for playing games like this...

Thought this would be horrible.  Far from it.   Pretty fun, actually.   Yeah, it's simpler than Magic or most any other CCG, but not simple to the point of stupid.

Pokemon is a great game to introduce deck building to kids.  The collectible card aspect is annoying as megagamers with enough cash can just buy good cards (ala MTG), but there are viable strategies beyond just heavy hitting that can surprise even the EX-rich player.  It ain't perfect, but Pokemon keeps my interest better than many other kid-oriented games.

Many of the basic cards are boring and too similar.  Most of the art is just the generic Sugimori art cut-and-pasted onto a background.  There's a lot of cards that do nothing if you fail a coin flip.  Getting the cards you need at the right time can be extremely difficult, especially if you're bad at flipping.  There's no mulligan system.  Many rare cards are BAD.

But Pokémon!

Mediocre.  I used to be a Gym Leader around 1999 at the bookstore I worked at.  I got to play a bunch of hotshot kids with custom-built decks fueled by generous parental allowance.  Due to the rules for Gym Leaders, I wasn't allowed to customize my deck in any way, so when I wasn't keeping the peace between 10-year-olds, I was getting my ass handed to me by them and their customized decks.  I ran a big double-elimination tournament at the end of the season (complete with bracket!) and the kid who lost the final and came in second place started crying.  I laughed.

Simpler than MtG, no matter who thinks I'm wrong for saying that.  It is NOT just about the same game.  The underlying mechanic is similar, yes but, that's like saying Poker and Blackjack are the same game.  Anyhow, nothing inherently wrong with this, it's more that I have found more mature players with MtG than I have found with Pokemon, so I never really got into this one.  Sort of... meh.

RATING: 5.5
I grew up with Pokemon, so this will likely always have some appeal to me simply due to nostalgia.

The game is simple (almost to a fault), and the metagame seems a bit boring to me nowadays due to how powerful megas and EXs are. Like most TCGs, a lot depends on how well you build your deck and what cards you draw early on, so sometimes you'll flat out steamroll your opponent (or get blown out yourself).

Still, it's a fun game to pull out and play on occasion. The modern cards' look and feel appeals to me, and the Generations stuff they're releasing this year (2016) has me interested.

If you like Pokemon, buy a few paired theme decks and check it out. If you want something incredibly competitive and strategic, you're better off looking elsewhere.

I have all my Pokemon inventoried, so willing to trade specific cards, due to my having multiples.  

Still looking for specific cards to complete my collection.  I play for fun, so not looking for specific waves, just the cards.

RATING: 5
a light fluff game of children's magic. This is fun and straight forward but can easily get one sided if one opponent gets evolve cards early and the other player does not have an opportunity to build their own characters. Because of this, the luck of the draw plays too much of a role in the game.

Harry Potter CCG seems better for my 5 and 8 y.o. But after a few plays it is growing on me. 

It does seem a bit complex (in comparison to HP CCG) so I haven't incorporated weakness & strength to the gameplay yet.

(Retired)

I've been a long time fan of the series, and have been playing this since fossil (I was very very very young). Its battling but on a different level, so much more rewarding than the main series videogames. My only issue is since the game is a TCG, it can be very expensive, cards come in booster packs that have randomly inserted cards, your not guaranteed to get what your looking for, which will result in a lot of money thrown down the gutter.

I played this when it first came out, and really got into it. I was fond of customizable card games at that stage of my life, and found the odds of getting good cards a little better then most (or maybe I was just lucky). Took it somewhat seriously at the time, yet not enough to win any of the tournaments I joined (tended to place well though). Got out of it once the expansion packs started to drain the wallet. Bought the sporadic pack since just to see where they were going with the series. Also bought a bunch that combined to form video games with the Nintendo E-Reader. Since the game has gone on for as long as it has, and since I thoroughly enjoyed the game when I was younger, I can't help but rate it highly. Go Charizard!

OWNED SINCE 2000
My kids were young they began playing this, and my wife and I also purchased some cards to play with our  kids. It is a fun game, but it is a CCG; therefore, we never purchased a competitive deck or collected all of the cards that we wanted to get. It is a great game, but I do prefer LCG. To make this a much better game, we apply "cube" rules, using the cards we have. This makes it a better game.

I've now played this over a dozen times with my kids, and it's grown on me. We enjoy it mostly because we like the show, and I'd rather they play this than the video games. In some games one of us just steamrolls the other, but most games are close and quite fun, as are the theme decks you can buy. I like that it's much less complicated than most CCGs I've played.

RATING: 7.9
Competitive Tournaments are a 9.5
Cost makes it a 2

I'd rather spend money on durable board games now...

But let me reminisce the good times: 
-the tension and pressure of high caliber tournament play where every little decision makes the difference. (Ninetales vs Garb/Drampa/Tauros vs John @ Wizards Chest)
-opening packs and pulling something awesome was such a great blast to the past of my childhood
-I love how it's a very simple game, yet when you get competitive you can start to see how the seemingly "simple decisions" are truly game-breaking.  
-There is an interesting resource management tempo aspect that I am terrible at

I can still see myself getting a deck together for a regionals, the experience is definitely fun, but is there another game I can get that competitive high from that won't cost as much?

We played this about 12+ years ago and found that every aspect of this CCG was a great learning tool for young kids.  My son was encouraged to read more and was introduced to the early elements of math through playing Pokemon.  The game design is tight and leaves no grey area for conflicts as does Magic the Gathering with its instant and interrupt phases.  Having been a member of a local and well organized Pokemon League has also taught my son the importance of how to lose a game gracefully.  Two thumbs-up from this SuperMom!

Rating based on one play with my 6 year old son.  

Interesting card game that provides many tactical decisions, from building your deck to when to evolve to higher level Pokemon.   The game is a little difficult for a six (almost seven) year old to understand those nuances.  For example, he wanted to evolve to stronger Pokemon, but didn't have the energy cards to power their attacks.

It is fun, so we'll give it some more tries to see if he can master the more complex challenges this game offers.  The art on the cards is nice for kids, and although the game involves fighting, it isn't particularly violent.

I had a lot of fun with this game when my son was younger.  I thought it was a good use of the characters and the gameplay was actually challenging once you got into it.  My favorite thing about this game is in the last couple of years my friends children have discovered the game and they don't know how to play, so I have been teaching my friends this game.  So apparent6ly the game is still going after all these years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Overly simplistic.  Inactive player has zero agency (no fast effects or even defensive/blocking choices).  Monsters' weaknesses and resistances largely reduce combat to rock-paper-scissors.

Cute little CCG that I have played with one of my daughters.  She is quite interested in the anime monsters (particularly the cute ones) and likes collecting them at least as much as she likes playing the game.  It is more fun for me to play this with her than most other games she likes.  Between the deck building and the in-game decisions regarding hand management and timing the appropriate card play, this is a fairly involved game for its target audience.   Further play has shown that I like this game quite a bit.

Many useless cards and many games come down to which deck has a better matchup, but nostalgia and some cool ideas albeit executed poorly makes this game get an above average rating. In particular, I like the evolution and retreating mechanics, and also how overpowered the utility cards are in this game compared to other games; it allows you to have a "toolbox" feel to your game as you have so strong card searching capabilities that you can include very situational cards in your deck for specific cases.

I played in the base set when it first came out. Not sure how the game has evolved (pun so intended) since then, but I remember it being a simple battle game that could keep me and multiple friends busy on a weekend sleepover. 
Although, now that I'm older, I have to say that the entire premise of pokemon seems silly and sort of cruel. No creature deserves to be hauled around in a small pokeball and only allowed out to battle other creatures for the enjoyment of its human oppressors.

Despite all the negative criticism, I think Pokemon is one of the best CCG's ever made available. People put this down because it's Pokemon but the fact is that the rules of this game are exceptionally brilliant and the game is pretty fair so long as the player's are smart enough to construct good decks. Everyone thinks this is for small kids, I'm 22 and thrash little kids on this game, picking skillful cards and planning a good strategy to win. Yes there is strategy in this game and plenty of tactics. There is so much more to the base game, try buying boosters and see where it will lead you.

I only have cards from the 90s.

It was incredibly frustrating to see everyone willing to trade and collect those cards when I was younger, while no one was willing to actually play the game. As a side note, the "Energy" cards are pretty ugly, so no one wanted to collect them. This created a bit of a circular problem, because it's not possible to play the game without enough of those cards.

While this is actually a decent game with hidden depths, it is marred by horrible imbalances - in short, rare cards are far better than common ones. In a game for kids, this is even more disastrous than normally.

Great game for kids, though we play exclusively with the pre-constructed theme decks (and mix'n'matches thereof). Doubtless we play hugely sub-optimally as a result, but who cares? The kids have great fun, and it beats the hell out of descending into the aimless collecting that most kids seem to do. The games are often weirdly memorable; here's a (banal) example from my 9-yr old son, transcribed from a letter to his best friend:
"I had a Pokemon battle with my Dad last night. I was water, and he was fire. I used my Jynx’s Mimic to get another hand (in cards). I got Totodile and Slopoke. On Dad’s turn he used his Pikachus Tail Slap for 10 damge. I drew a card and got Slowbro. I evolved Slowpoke. I attached an energy to Slowbro and used Lick and managed to Paralize Pikachu. Dad evolved Cyndaquil to Quilava onto his bench. On my turn I drew Croconaw! I evolved Totodile, and used Lick again. Pikachu was Paralized again. Dad evolved Quilava to Tysphlosin. Then I got Feraligatr. And I sent up Slowbro (Jynx had been KO’ed) and used Big Yawn on Dad’s 2ed Pikachu. After Dad’s turn, I KOed Pikachu. 4 of my turns later I had knocked out with Slowbro Pikachu, Hoothoot and Cyndaquil and on my bench I had: Feraligatr, Eggzacutor, and Hypno. Score: Me: 4 Dad 2 or something like that. The important thing is I was winning. Then I used Eggzacutors Big Eggslosin to KO another Cindquil. Dad put up Typholsion And used Fire Spin. Big Mistake: KO Eggso, But let Ferali charge in with Surf! Final Score: Me: 6 Dad: 3."

All Pokemon CCG material to Zachary.
A bunch of starter sets, but starting to collect complete playsets from Black and White onwards.

The only CCG my 12 year old son will play with me.  A couple of the starter sets will get you started.  Then once you're hooked, there's almost no end to the cash you can spend in the Pokemon universe. 

What an excellent marketing engine these folks have.  From the video games, clothes, dolls, action figures, movies/television show, etc., and this CCG, Nintendo is doing what it can to make sure your kid eats, lives, and breathes Pokemon all day.  The lore is strong and consistent across all of the product lines.

Back to the CCG itself, the rules cement themselves after a few plays, and the aforementioned starter sets have tokens and playmats to remind you of play order and special conditions.

My kid and I have been going back and forth bashing each other with continually improved decks.  I had one deck built that I thrashed him on at least 3 games in a row.  Instead of getting frustrated or giving up, he continued to improve his deck until he made and played one that beat mine (and now I'm afraid of that deck).  Though I would like him to have the same sorts of enthusiasm for other games (that I like) or even school (he can't get past a C in math, but has all of these Pokemon attributes memorized, go figure), I'll be happy to continue playing this game with him in the future.

My son likes to play this a lot with his friends and talks me into a game at times.  I finally bought my own preconstructed deck after getting frustrated with the ones he would build for me.  My opinion of the game has improved significantly over time and I now appreciate it for what it is and have gained something of an appreciation for the allure of CCGs.  It's not the type of game I'm generally in the mood for, but when we do play it, they have turned into some very intense, serious games.

I grew up with this game. When I was a kid and it was first released in the U.S. I would have rated it a 10. My cousins and I played this avidly. The cards and decks that were popular during Jungle and Fossil era and completely outmatched by newer cards. The creep is strong in this one.

What? Yeah, OK, actually my son is completely engaged in this. It's neat to see. Remarkably cheap cards. Come on, I've seen baseball cards... never seen any this flimsy - not even in a box of corn flakes - and most of them cost less than $4 for 10.

The game... I didn't feel like there was a whole heckuva lot of decision making after the deck-building. What there was a whole heckuva lot of was randomness, as in, my son draws that guy with the Dragonbreath at the beginning of the game and just toasts me. While that might actually make it a better experience for kids playing against adults, it does not make it, you know, a good game.

I guess the randomness means I like the game more with more Trainer cards and whatnot, so I can go thru my deck and pick out my buddy Arceus. Mitigates the luck of the draw somewhat.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Ignore the fluffy cards. Ignore the "kiddy appeal". The mechanics to this game are solid. Not too complex, enough space for decent strategy, and fun. No other card-game has managed this, either going too complex (Magic, for one), or too simple (What was that last marvel card game that involved red/green cards?)

Ja, auch Pokemon habe ich eine zeitlang gespielt und ausprobiert. Und tatsächlich steckt hinter der kindgerechten Aufmachung ein ganz gutes Sammelkartenspiel, dass den Flair und die Mechaniken der Vorlage sehr gut einfängt. Natürlich waren die taktischen Möglichkeiten reduziert und nicht vergleichbar mit z.B. Magic. Entweder man spielt eine Enegeriekarte an einPokemon und startet einen Angriff, doer man zieht es zurück und versucht es mit einem anderen Pokemon. Eben genauso wie im Gameboy Spiel. Ich kann nichts über die unzähligen Mechaniken der Erweiterungen sagen, da ich Pokemon auch relativ schnell wieder aufgehört habe. Für Kids sicherlich ein cooles Spiel!

The game itself isn't hard to learn and it is entertaining to play, but as with all card games victory can come down to luck of draw a little too often.

Now totally unplayed and yet I can't bring myself to part with the collection!

Only rated this according to playing with my young son, and on that basis Pokemon is good compared to the some of the other stuff I've had to play with him in the past (eg Uno, Trouble, Yahtzee etc). Lots of kids are just into collecting and trading the cards only.

As a deckbuilder game, this is OK but seems skewed to collecting and trading to get cheap, powerful basic Pokemon rather than relying on evolving basic Pokemon to something more powerful. The use of a coin to determine some outcomes just seem pointless uncertainty to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A CCG in the same style as a Magic the Gathering. What's different here though is that the game has the world of Pokemon to draw on and from that point of view it is perfect for the younger audience. 

What makes it different is that it is much easier to have multi-factioned decks here as many Pokemon have attack moves that can use any energy type, instead of being mana specific. that allows deck construction to be a little more flexible and indeed a deck can have some good variety to make multiple pays feel quite different. 

The other major difference is that Pokemon do not need energy/mana to get into play...instead they need energy to make their attacks. 

The final game changing element of the game is that Pokemon can of course evolve and that is thematically cool to match the core material but it is also fun to watch in a game sense as well. 

To win a player must knock out all of their opponent's Pokemon that are in play or take the last of their 6 prize cards (a prize card is won when an enemy Pokemon is defeated). this helps the game devolving into a 'war of attrition'. 

The game does have a large degree of luck within the design because many attacks or other cards require the flip of a coin to see if the attack or benefit works. But for me this is perfect for the age range the game is targeted at and helps level the playing field between children and their parents. 

All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this and would play it again with my son...in fact...I want to catch them all!

RATING: 3
A nice attempt at capturing the license in a CCG that falls really flat in the end. First and foremost, the energy system is more punishing than missing land drops in Magic, because an early "fully equipped" Pokémon can swipe several enemy creatures before being kept in check. The RPSish weaknesses/resistances system, a staple of the theme, does work in the video game but not here; because since energies are tied to Pokémon/attack types, you can't reliably have more than 2 types of Pokémons in your team. Which implies some matchups can be really unfair: of course my deck full of fire/combat Pokémons will likely get wrecked by your water/psy one! Also unhelpful is that the evolution mechanic requires good draws, which once again reward luck. This can be mitigated by trainer cards focused on deck manipulation, but only since you can shove in as many as necessary for constructed play; which leaves Pokémon TCG as a total luck-fest for the purpose of drafting (my main interest in CCGs).

The game could possibly find a saving grace in the charisma of its characters and clever card design, unfortunately it can only count on the former: overpowered effects (discard your hand and draw seven cards) and literal coin flips are so prominent I had stopped caring before the devs had an occasion to correct their aim past the first three sets. The game is still alive, I hear.

What started as an older brother learning the rules for his younger brothers ages 12 & 6, turned into a hobby and a job.  I started to take them to Toys R Us for weekly gaming.  Then I got offered a job there and worked through college. I ended up running the Pokemon League for years. So even though this is the "kids" version of Magic, it holds it own and is very nostalgic for me.

Somehow the rules-as-written make this simple combat game sound a whole lot harder and more complex than it actually plays out.  Given the way my son's friends use the cards, this game could really use a short intro ruleset to capture (haha!) these young minds.  I just don't think that tournament-quality rules suit everyone.
EX and Mega-evolution cards seem unnecessarily unbalancing, although playing the game with just a starter pack contains so many random elements that it's tricky getting traction on this fun game.

My first trading card game.  I was really into it when it first came out, naturally.  Years later, I finally played it again and beat someone without much effort, so I'm not sure that the game is really all that challenging.  While I'm glad the card game is still doing well, I prefer Pokémon in video game form.

Was really enjoyable from 1997-2000, when I was 9-12 years old. Is basically Magic the Gathering in the Pokemon universe. Loved the artwork and collectible nature given the theme (gotta catch'em all!), however this comes with the disadvantage of high cost and difficulty in attaining your favourite "rare" Pokemon. Although I really like the Pokemon franchise to this day (particularly the first 151 Pokemon), I haven't revisited this game since 2000 and don't plan to.

I think I like Pokemon more than Yugioh TCG because in Pokemon back when I played (base and fossil sets), there wasnt an advantage to the one who spent tremendously more. I'm sure that's different now though, so I might like Yugioh if I cross compared them.

I think this TCG was okay, but I wish it could've just been an LCG or something...I despise the money mongering model TCGs follow.

Plays: many duels (10+ I think)

It's not a bad game. Deckbuilding is not as good as a game like Magic because you're severely limited by the fact that you need to include evolution chains in your decks. The actual gameplay is decent, though. The only major detractor from a gameplay perspective is how much luck is a factor. Many games are decided by a coin flip (literally). 

The best thing about this game, in my opinion, is the theme. Pokemon are awesome (like seriously, who doesn't love Pokemon?) and the art on the cards, especially ones from the late 90s to mid-2000s, is often really cool and sometimes created from mediums like clay. I also like how the cards look a lot, especially EXs and old reverse holos. Seriously beautiful to look at. The aesthetics of this game is the only thing I prefer about it compared to Magic. Besides that, Magic is just a better game with better deckbuilding and more strategy.

Rating based on playing a couple of games with my son. He's 7 now so more and more game opportunities are opening for us and Pokemeon was a surprise given its less than 6.0 BGG rating. I actually enjoy it.
We played a couple of games during Christmas for the first time and they were OK. We recently got a world championship deck which confused the heck out of me and the game dragged as I kept reading his cards and scratching my head. I then tried the online version which is really well implemented and highlighted some rules I had missed.
Both dad and son looking  forward to getting some more cards and building some "simple" decks.

Many plays before BGG. A good hand-holding CCG for kids. At the top level there is a lot of interesting strategy and tactics, but it's still not super deep. Many cards are strictly better than others, so rarity and blind boosters are problems.

But there is something to be said for a reasonably thematic game that plays smoothly with no interrupts or "stack silliness".

Structurally, it has some problems (a bad start is impossible to recover from), but it fit the theme of Pokemon very well, and the customization was cool.

Great little card game to play with my pre teen kids. On a basic level it makes them think about their actions and I like it for that. We just play the basic starter kit with a few cards thrown in for fun. 
Easy light weight fun that work when im in the mood.

Purchased Japanese version cards from the 2009-2010 series. Lots of luck-based mechanisms which can be annoying at times, but can surprisingly play out all the way to the last card and be quite exciting :). Mainly what is fun is the deck-building portion of the game, rather than an emphasis on hand management.

Kids birthday, 2009, age 7.

Update at age 7 and a half: they couldn't care less about this game.  Cards are scattered all over their closet and might as well be thrown away.  I was mildly interested in at first, until I figured out that the rule problems are worse than Magic, and there is no comprehensive rule manual. 

Kids are 8 now:  somehow I still find myself buying Pokemon cards.  Nobody plays, because the game itself is largely unplayable, but one of the kids likes to collect the cards. 

Kids' 9th birthday: Big *eye roll* upon receiving some Pokemon cards as a birthday gift.  "Dad, nobody likes those anymore!"

After a few plays my group seems to share the consensus that this is a fun game.  We play with the Battle Arena Decks (I have all the sets so far) which are well-built and ready to go right out of the box.  There are lots of interesting combos and strategies to work out.  The only thing we are not sure about is a situation where one player was defeated in 1 or 2 turns?  I'm not certain if those two had been playing correctly (everyone else was new except for me).  Even if it was played correctly, it was one of those extremely rare cases. The second game they played was much more normal. 

Overall, I'd say this game reminds us of the MTG kind of experience, which we all enjoy, but with some new and refreshing twists that require us to strategize a bit differently than we normally would.

Yes the art is sometimes silly and inconsistent but we don't mind it.

I am very aware that my love for this game is - at least partially - caused by childhood nostalgia. That isn't the only reason I like this game, as many of my childhood favorites now do fall flat for me gameplay-wise. I'm also very sure that the production values of this game are a big part of its appeal. The cardstock is good quality, and the artwork is all very beautiful, colourful and charming (though there are a few exceptions, but that's all a matter of taste).

Pokémon TCG has just the right mix of complexity, tactics and fun within a very short time span. The rules are simple enough to be explained quickly, yet deep enough so the game isn't just a random luckfest. You have to take the special attacks and Pokémon powers into account and plan a few turns ahead: will you buy time to evolve your Pokémon on your bench into bigger, better attackers and give them enough Energy to use their attacks? Or will you attack your opponent with cheap, expendable Basic Pokémon? You also have to focus on your victory condition. Will you beat your opponent with a Blitzkrieg to be the first to six prizes, or will you wage a battle of attrition to get Basic Pokémon off his/her bench, or deplete his/her deck first?

Playing is actually only part of the fun. A great deal of quality time can be spend building or tweaking your deck. Testing the performance of the deck you built against that of another player, or trying new combinations of cards is a very rewarding experience. And there are some cool synergies to be discovered. You can go with a single type of Pokémon, or combine two types (For example: combine Grass-type Pokémon with Water-types to counter Grass' weakness to Fire, and sprinkle some colorless Pokémon in this mix, who can use both Grass and Water Energy cards for their attacks). You can find the trainer cards that make your deck work well (For example: [url=http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/f/fa/EnergyRetrievalBaseSet81.jpg/200px-EnergyRetrievalBaseSet81.jpg]Energy Retrieval[/url] in a deck with Fire-type Pokémon allows you to recover the Energy cards that many of their attacks make you discard).

You don't need the rare cards to play a fun game. Good decks for casual play can be built with just common and uncommon cards. And you can find those cards online at very cheap prices, especially when people sell of their old collection piecemeal - since they'll sell off the rare cards seperately (and more expensively) and often want to get rid of the rest in bulk. Playing with the 15-year-old sets like I do kind of feels like driving an oldtimer on a sunday afternoon. You're doing more than just playing a game. You're playing a piece of history. A piece of pop culture or childhood nostalgia that has been shared by a great many people around the world. And that's why I think you still [b][i]Gotta catch 'em all[/i][/b]!

 Like other games of this nature it is all about resource management, card flow, and synergy. The gameplay and rules are fairly simple, but they are not overly restrictive. This is an easy to play game but it is still very engaging. Just in playing with the themed decks I can see there is some depth here. I do not want to go all the way down the rabbit hole but I think we could have a ton of fun with a wide selection of pre-constructed themed decks.

Solid CCG, suitable for all ages.  I played this when it first came out and only collected cards from the 1st set.  Once you have a decent set, you don't really need any more to get satisfaction out of the game.  Games tend to be satisfyingly close.  Evolution mechanic is fun.  Unfairly characterized as a kids-only game.

I had, and still have, an affinity for the Pokémon franchise (except for the awful TV show). This was the first TCG I tried, and it was way after the Pokémon craze was over. Though I've long stopped playing this game, I still keep up with the new expansions.

The gameplay is simple yet functional, and anybody who has played the the main series will find it highly intuitive and thematic. There are loads of coins to flip, but many good decks filter out such cards, essentially reducing the luck factor as much as possible. I also like the fact that commons and uncommons play a vital role since you need them to evolve into bigger and rarer Pokémon. Having avoided the money pit trap, I enjoyed myself making quirky (and somewhat competitive) decks out of cheap rares and uncommons that nobody wanted.

The Pokémon TCG has been around for 15 years now, and although there has been some power creep and added complexity, it's still a great card game to introduce to kids, for either playing or collecting purposes.

My kids (7 and 3) love to collect these.  Ben, the older one, knows the rules and can recite practically every card.  He usually prefers to play a simplified version (solo or with his little brother) where he just lets 2 Pokemon battle.  The cards have interesting powers and there is a good amount of strategic and tactical decisions.  Kid rating--7 for the actual game, 10 for fun playing with them.

RATING: 5
With so many CCGs out there, I think this one is just way too simple and bland, especially considering the cost and time investment required to play any of these.

The game really does just consist of trying to get the better Pokemon fielded so you can do more damage to the enemy's Pokemon.  This gets pretty boring pretty quickly.  There are no combos or exciting abilities even though this game has been around since I was in high school.  I even looked up tournament-winning decks to see if there was interesting stuff like what I'm looking for our there.  Nope.  The winning decks just have the most efficient Pokemon in them so they can win the Pokemon beatdown race.

Even if you are a fan of Pokemon I think this game is just too bland to get anything out of.

A faster, somewhat easier trading card game for when Magic seems like a bit much. Basically unlimited card draw power leads to decks that feel way more overpowered than MTG, and victory tends to be a landslide, but each turn presents many interesting choices related to how you're going to prioritize powering up your Pokémon.

I'm no expert, but a lot of this seems a little poorly designed.  The game feels overlong, and I'm not sure how balanced some of the card draw supplemental cards are.  Also, the idea of losing all "mana" attached to a creature when they are knocked out seems unreasonably harsh.  Overall quite playable, only time will tell if it's actually designed well.

Pokemon is an interesting CCG that revolves around the now infamous show of the same name.

The game is relatively easy to pick up, and kids will have a fun time exploring its mechanics.  The core stratgy is to match up your Pokemon against your opponent in a way which maximizes their strengths.

My daughter really enjoyed the game, and I found it to be a fun romp with a good amount of strategy.  I'm looking forward to trying it out again.

After my daughter hooked me on this game, I played competitively off and on for years, once placing 3rd at a Regional Championship, and winning a few City and smaller tournaments. I have to admit I had a lot of fun with this, and going to tournaments was always fun and quenched my thirst for competition. It was mainly the cost of keeping up with the newest sets that drove me away, but also some of the cheating that went on (not to mention the paranoia that someone MIGHT be cheating against me) turned me off. Now that I've gotten into a board gaming group, I don't really feel the pull of Pokemon any more. I do still watch the streaming of the bigger tournaments (Nationals/Worlds.) That still interests me quite a bit.

This might have been a better game 10 years ago - I understand it's changed a lot over time. But in 2013-2014, I'd say it pretty well sucks, and I only play when my kids drag me into it. Fundamentally, the structure of the game just does a poor job of translating the fun of the video games (which I do enjoy) into cards. The video games are fun as an elaborate rock-paper-scissors exercise, where you've got a full bench of well-trained Pokes to switch in if you feel it's worth the loss of the switching turn. That's a decent fundamental idea for a game. But the way the TCG Pokes and Energy work is that you basically want to set up one huge Pokemon, probably supported by some combo, to take down everything in its path. Switching is discouraged by various mechanics and limitations. This warps various other aspects of the game, especially overpowered "basic" cards that make evolutions mostly pointless and competitive decks that run a huge ratio of auxiliary deck manipulation cards. After many years of playing MtG along with some Netrunner and other games, Pokemon feels really clumsy and mostly devoid of interesting decisions at the table. For all that, it's not even especially accessible to younger players. A simple, core-set only MtG deck would be just as easy for a kid to play, if not easier, and offer more opportunities for good thinking.

I purchased two cases when this came out. Though an awful game, I made my money back selling just two cards. So it was not an all bad experience.

This and Magic are the only CCGs I have played. Seems that its success is due to the fact of it being based off a video game and "cool" characters. Do not enjoy especially since the player who ends up collecting the better cards to put in their deck will most likely win.

Pokemon CCG is probably the simplest of many of the CCGs I played. Its straightforward and easy to teach.  My real enjoyment from this game came from using the rules to run a live-action version of the game.

I am not big into ccg games and this game did it for me.  I played this all the time as a kid.  I think I spent every cent of my paper route money on it and still found the rich kids always got the cards they need.  Then they started adding new chips and moves and the game just started to tick me off now I keep the few cards I did not get rid of in storage.

Not so much into it as a game, but more so to scratch my collecting and nostalgia itch. The Pokemania hit me at just the right demographic (grade 6-7) and trading cards at school is a cherished memory. The downside is, like most CCG's, that it is a money pit that never stops.

1999 2-player Starter Box. Includes two 30-card decks, starter game guide, rulebook, playmat, instructional CD-ROM, and a sealed holographic Machamp card. This is a perfect intro to the game with some original late-90s era cards.

Played this for years and it cost me a fortune. Now play it online (for free) and it is still great.

My stepson is now obsessed with Pokemon so we've jumped back in with Fate Collides. Myself and three of my children are really enjoying it and can't wait for Steam Siege :)

Still playing regularly with the kids and they're actually starting to beat me from time to time.

I used to enjoy this game but it has since introduced enormous power creep.  I always played with reverse prize cards to change the positive feedback into negative feedback to make for closer matches.

Game mechanics for this CCG are quite good, with clearly written rules. The subject matter is what makes this primarily a kids game, and I only play it with my son and his friends. Unfortunately, even the young kids rarely seem to actually play the game and are mostly interested in it for the collecting.

My oldest son got into this in the late 90's craze of the game. He probably has 2-3 complete sets of cards now.  I started playing him and had a lot of fun with it.  We started playing as a family of 4 in attack anybody on your turn.  The oldest has moved on to Yu-Gi-Oh now.  I like Pokemon better than yu-gi-oh.

Playing a lot of the online version because it's free. And, if you buy a pack (or trade other stuff in for packs at the LGS), you get a code for an online pack - Free! Unlike MtGO which is the SAME price as paper MtG.

Its a fine game really. Havn't played a ton, but doesn't have any aspects that really stand out to me in a tcg. Might be biased because I had hyped up what i had hoped it would be when i was a child. Like the tokens and effect markers a lot.

Another entry level CCG for the kids. I tryed it when it first came out years ago but found it to be too light. This did not change (and it is ok like this - for the kids). But I do not like the modern artwork as much as the old one - too many computer graphics which just look cheap.

This is a fun CCG for young gamers.  Not to be played too much or too seriously.  Just build a couple of decks and trade a few cards here and there.  The thing about Pokemon is that you can buy cards that dominate over the average common little basic cards, essentially breaking the game.  So just make some balanced, even decks and have a fun light romp.

I expected to be able to jump straight into MTG with the kids.  Not so!  They prefer the theme and gameplay of Pokemon (coin flips galore!) - so here we are.

I had no idea what to expect, but Pokemon is certainly a fun enough game in its own right.

Our gameplay has been limited entirely to the use of theme decks.  It's doubtful that we'll ever get into Pokemon deck construction.  So much the better for my wallet...

This is a great--and I mean great--children's card game. I'm giving it a 7 because the luck factor is fairly large.

UPDATE: Rating increased to an 8, and honestly, I should rate it higher, but I feel as though I shouldn't. I take back my previous statement about luck. It's not nearly as abundant as I previously imagined.

I'm also going to pull back a bit on the part I said about it being a kid's game. It does speak to kids more than adults--that is most definitely true--but it is a complex game that is usually won by the better player. And it's so much more fun than Magic.

Plan on joining a Pokemon League with my son after he turns six. We'll see how that goes.

Aliens and Dads will rate this game very high.  But if you're a worldly, culturally savy kind of person who feels inundated with this popular theme, it's going to be hard to appreciate the beauty of the game design.

It's an immanently practical 25-minute play.  Rule complexity is invitingly low, and PSPACE complexity is seductively high.  And here's the design finesse that really sets Pokemon TCG apart: It's chance seems to be tuned to ensure a skill to win ratio just low enough to reward serious effort, and just high enough to keep a novice excited.  Add to that an amazing variety of genuinely beautiful, oringinal artwork and design, a mythology traced from adolescent daydreams, and relatively affordable and almost infinite expandability, and you've got this: a game that any two humans of any different skill levels can get going in a few minutes, have pyrotechnical fun however the hands go, and sustaining strategic and hobbyist interest for years.

If you're kids are between 5 and 15, you should have in your home a chess board, a go board, a conventional card deck, and a pair of Pokemon decks.

The kids and I recently started watching the original Pokémon series and that led to me getting interested in the card game.  The number of "its better than I expected" comments caught my attention so I ordered a couple of theme decks to start us out... and we're hooked!  The collectable aspect is clearly at the forefront here but there is some skill to deck building along with some planning and almost push your like type elements to game play that make it more fun and perhaps a little deeper in play than the rules suggest.  Really a perfect introductory CCG and my kids and I are having a lot of fun exploring it!

If I had to rate this game based on gameplay it would probaly be more like a 5, but this game holds a special place for me. I grew up with pokemon in the 90's, so I know alot of the pokemons(Not all). 

This is also the only game, I can get my brother to play with me.

Pokemon is actually a decent CCG.  A lot of the Trainers let you search your deck for certain cards, and there's more strategy than you would think at first glance.  However, it seems to be a money game...and one that I'm not willing to invest in readily.  So my deck sucks.

This has a problem similar to that with [thing=463][/thing]: You need energy in order to attack; no energy, no attack.  So, yes, putting the right ratio of energy cards in your deck is part of the game, but with 60-card decks, it's very, very possible to be completely impotent for the whole game.  :yuk:

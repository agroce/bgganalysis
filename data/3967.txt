RANK: 1735

RATING: 7.5
TABLETOP MINIATURE WARGAME

One of Games Workshop's better systems, quite tactical. Different scenarios require different styles of play. Campaigns adds positively to the experience. Unfortunately wildely supported. Some of the later fleets need revising/improving.

Fleets owned: Eldar pirates, Imperial, Tyranids

RATING: 8
One of the best and most balanced games GW has ever put out.  The ships are beautiful and easy to paint.  The rules are not for the faint of heart though, so German gamers need not apply.

can be slow and boring, depending on which missions you play

RATING: 7.5
One of the simpler tactical space battle system I have played. The Minis are top notch as we all know from GW.

Game provides great flavour of WH40K universe. Gameplay is fast. 

A very good game/system  on its own.

Nice ship to ship combat, and fairly easy to learn.  The advanced rules let more experienced players add a new level of complexity to their games.

Every time I played this game I felt it would play better with counters. Especially that the ship is supposed to be where the stem of the base is, but infinitely smaller.

RATING: 9
I would say this is one of the best Games Workshop games on the market.  I love playing it, with either my Dark Eldar or Imperial fleet.  Fun, fast, and fairly tactical while being simple.  A great game.

RATING: N/A
Box set is opened, but never played with.  All plastic ships are still on the spues, and all pieces in the box set are near mint/mint condition.  I also have many other pewter ships and pieces that are still brand new in their boxes and sealed in their original shrinkwrap or in the plastic bag that Games Workshop ships them in.  Like the pewter space mines and fighters for example.

I also have 2 pewter ships put together with one primed and almost fully painted while the other is still bare.  If you want a complete list of all pieces I have feel free to ask, and i'll e-mail you the list.

If you have any other questions feel free to contact me.  I'm also on ebay under the user id Beukeboom22 in case you want a reference.

RATING: 6
Played this a few times and really liked it from what I remember.  The problem was I was getting into it when everyone else was in college and not really able to buy, or want to buy, miniatures.  After all, they had Magic and Doomtown cards to buy instead.  Jerks.  I still have all the mini's, and then a bunch more from a store closeout, as well as some mines, shuttles, and missiles so there is always the outside chance of playing it again.

This game never really got me. Sure the fleets look good and the rules system worked, I just felt there was something missing.

Now however, with my greatly renewed intrest in space combat (Damn you Battlestar Galactica) I am going to give this another go.

Some of my revious thoughts still remain. But going in with an open mind allowed me to think of this game in a better light.

RATING: 9
A naval miniatures system intelligently welded into a science fiction backstory. Bloodthirsty mix of future-modern weapons and boarding actions. The least 'fussy' of GW's stable of games and easily the most addictive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
(pre-?)Dreadnought era naval battles in space - kicks ass!

4 fleets painted - chaos, imperial, eldar, tyranids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Excellent starship combat game, rather than the zoom-whoosh of Starwars etc, this simulates huge ships (we are talking tens of kilometers long here) ponderously fighting battles using WW1 dreadnought tactics. Excellent feel to the game and superb miniatures that are a joy to look at.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the ship designs. The system has some nice features but the starter box only has a bunch of cruisers that are all very similar (really just 1 model with variants). The cost of other models is (usual GW)prohibitive. Too expensive for the gameplay for me. Hence sold on.

Was rated 5. If GW doesn't want their products covered by this site, though, I'll oblige (to a degree).

Spaceship combat for 40K. Disappointingly generic-feeling, especially for a 40K-based game. And I prefer a lot more realism in my space combat, to boot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the better miniature starship games out there, without the cumbersome armor penetrating diagrams or lugubrious rules of many other capital ship games. Much more playable than the Renegade Legion stuff. Really captures the feel of naval action in space.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Own two fleets -

a. Imperial:

4 ? Cruisers
2 Dauntless Light Cruisers
2 Falchion Destroyers
4 Sword Destroyers
8 Cobra Destroyers

b. Tyranid fleet (to be constructed from my 'nid bits)

and a space dock, defense platforms, 2 mines, 2 fighters.

My two plays were with my prior Eldar fleet.  Light, fast and fun with great 40K fluff.

A fun miniatures game that plays like Age of Sails in space.

RATING: 7
Yes, it's naval battles in space.  But it's in fantastically flavor-full and evocative space. The miniatures may be a real pain in the booty to come by, as this is getting to be an old horse by Games Workshop standards. Has a fun and very playable campaign system.

Take naval tactics from the age of wooden ships and iron men and set them in a far future age of enormous transdimensional battleships and you've pretty much got it.  A great game for nostalgia's sake as much as anything else.  Hopefully my son will enjoy it as much as I do.

Warhammer in space ;) I love space games so when opportunity arise I jumped on this game. Sadly enough cannot find a lot of players that are into miniature games. Like warhammer this game has great potential to become a pretty costly investment ;) All in all great theme, great miniatures if you can control the "collector" urge great game :)

This is the one and only space environment I really like (if you exclude those Orks), apart from the real one.
Space is Gothic to me.

Give it a 10 with pleasure. Couldn't play it much, 'cause it was a bit expensive for me to get them all. I'll go back to it one day. When my bank account will be strong enough, take my word.

Hat off to the designer. 

Silent broadsides, multiple torpedoes, crazy full-speed boarding. Mmmm this is love haha.

This is a space combat game in the same way that Star Wars is a realistic depiction of wars in space. No 3D movement, ramming, and a very dreadnought-era style of play may seem out of place, but in the context of the 41st Millenium this is a perfect mix.

Man O War had more pirate talk, but this might be a more balanced game.  Just feels so right.

I have two sets of this - both I will probably never play.

First I don't believe is complete.  Was part of an ebay transaction gone wrong.  Some of the pieces were broken and fell through the shot Gothic box into the equally shot shipping box from Canada.  Some may have escaped shipping box and could be cruising around various nebulae.

Second one was from a guy that showed up once and only once at our game club and left it by accident.  He never claimed it and we couldn't get a hold of the guy.

RATING: 8
Nifty game of space combat.  Basically it's Man o' War in space.  It doesn't even try to realistically simulate space battles and plays  all the better for it.  My only downside is that ordnance, especially bombers and fighters, can unbalance the game if you go too crazy with them.  A gentleman's agreement to limit carriers to one or two a side takes care of that nicely though.  It's a great feeling to concentrate all fire on an enemy capital ship and cripple or destroy it.  Just like in Return of the Jedi!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Of all of the Games Workshop games I own and have played, this one is probably my favorite.  Fairly low cost to get into and fun to play.  I have a very large chaos fleet and hope to someday put together a space marine fleet as well.

Oh, such potential...and such horrible implementation. BFG is in reality a 2 dimensional naval game with super cool miniatures and a decent set of rules. Then the "math" people at GW take control and flub the simple task of appointing costs to the models. Indeed, the Eldar and Necron armies totally overpower the game, (that is the sound of a toilet flushing). Cool ideas like their use of  ordnance, (plays like torpedoes), are left to run amok. Could have been awesome...

I really like this game.  After having travelled the path of Star Fleet Battles, Bab-5, and Fleet Action this was refreshing to play.  The record keeping is truly minimal in comparison to most other tactical space games.  The models are beautiful (I own Imperial, Chaos and Eldar Fleets) and the game just looks great on a well done tabletop.  The only thing that needed fixing (and Andy Chambers did fix it) was ordanance limiting rules.  The game should play closer to WW1 capital ships instead of WW2 Carrier groups.  If it were the otherway around, I feel that the ability of other ships to destroy ordanance needs to be pumped up.

GW Specialist games are usually fun to play, but get old quickly after figuring out the optimal tactics.  Luck is heavy with two very skilled players since there isn't much tactical depth to the game.

It is also one of the least aesthetically pleasing games in GW's repository.  I'd rather play Man O War or Epic.

[b]So...damn... [i]GOOD[/i][/b]!

This is a naval wargame at its top. Big points:
- terrain is created while playing, due to ship's shield explosion (blast markers or something); so clever
- dice chunking is always fun
- orders add a layer of tactical decisions worth of your victory (or defeat)
- TORPEDOES ARE PLAIN GOOD to crush your enemy's formation!

It's OOP you say? Go grab [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175155/forbidden-stars]Forbidden Stars[/url] ships, pick the rules online (they were freely released by GW time ago)(yes released for free. GW. In the same sentence. You know?).
And [i]play it[/i], damn you!

One of the better GW games, fun to play and needs some forward thinking to beat your opponent. Space Fleet battle fit well in the miniature gaming, as not much terrain is needed, and just a few models need to be carried around. Enjoy playing this, but opponents are hard to find, and game doesn't have much appeal to people net familiar with Warhammer 40k setting.

Solid space/naval game.  Very pretty minis.

UPDATE, 4/15/16: Star Wars Armada has basically obsoleted this one for me.  I'll keep my minis, because I painted them.  I don't ever see myself getting this one off the shelf again.

UPDATE: 11/15/16: Why should I keep this sitting on my shelf for no good reason?  I ended up trading this away for a big lot of X-Wing stuff.  I'm pleased, and so are the guys I traded with.  

I still think Armada's the better game, and I'm glad to be doubling down on it.  But I'm glad my old stuff is going to someone who will play it and love it.

Of the 3 space combat games I've played, this is my favorite. The deep 40K background is there, and the fleets perform much like their land-based counterparts do - Orks are tough, clumsy and in your face; Eldar prance around like annoying mosquitoes; Imperial fleet is nothing spectacular but good all-around; Chaos is slow but hard hitting.
Ships are quick to paint up to a gaming standard, and most models are still available from GW in 2008.

Somewhat lengthy, and some of the newer fleets are more difficult to play against (Necrons) if you are not used to them.  Can be used to supplement either an Epic or 40K campaign.  Boarding actions can be represented by 40K miniatures for the really dedicated hobbyist.  Reasonably quick to learn and paint the fleet.  Enjoyable.

I've been on a continuing quest for a space combat game.  This was one of the best that I have found so far.  The rules are fairly simple.  I learned it in half an hour and have taught others to play in half an hour as well.  For a game of this type that is fairly easy to learn, there is a great deal of strategy I find.  Different fleets play very differently.  Feel of the different fleets do match that of the fluff.

A downside is that it takes hours to paint the models.  I put up with it because I liked the game, at least initially.  I'm not so into painting models, but I do admit I appreciate how they look and felt my effort was worth while.

I haven't given it a higher rating due to the balance issues.  Playing the two main fleets (Imperial and Chaos) against each other is fun.  However, Orks were very underpowered.  Eldar was annoying.  Necron was so utterly broken in terms of game balance.  Certain matchups can lead to utter frustration for one side and occasionally both.  I've experienced too many match ups where it is considered a great achievement to score even one point on an enemy ship.  Even those this may fit the fluff, it is just not fun to play.

RATING: 5
Fun for a once-in-a-while beer 'n pretzels (e.g., brain-dead) gaming session. Easy to master tactics, coupled with some very unbalanced fleet lists (Necron, DE, Ork) make for a letdown after all of that prep (model assembly and painting) you've done to have a nice looking game on the table. Plays more like a WWI naval game than a space combat game. Again, nice if you like throwing piles of dice in your games.

A very fun game, especially when played where loses of cap ships all important (the loss of one would typically see that side trying to disengage), let down by the large number of houserules needed to correct force imblances and for raiding races if forced to fight a fleet engagement, auto concede making it often disappointing when fighting a campaign.

BFG was kind of a grail game for me when it was originally released. I was playing WH40K so I could not afford investing into a second tabletop system. Instead I just bought a few of the plastic cruisers and made up my own ruleset. Well, since then it has gone out of print and the prices on the secondary market are horrendous. But I still managed to cobble together most of the components and intend of having a fully functional game soon - as it still is a charming fleet-scale space battle games.

I am very sorry i have a problem with this kind of games where you have to constantly look up tables to see what happens. i can't get involved, it's just pretty boring.
I even won the game, probably without much merit and not even an evident superiority in luck. But once again i know that i prefer complex to complicated, and these games are just too complicated without being that complex.
At least i managed to arrive at the end of a simple 2 ships vs 2 ships game, hence the rating

This is my favorite space battle game ... which is saying a lot because I enjoy the genre.

It's a lot of fun to create your fleet, fall into formation, and then blast the heck out of the other fleet.

Granted, there are some other space games which are more realistic regarding physics or damage allocation, etc.  But for actual enjoyment of the game, this hits the spot for me.

Also, I'm a big fan of the whole 40K universe -- the backstory, etc., and how the various Games Workshop games tend to dovetail together.

Tried it in 2012, in the last days of its pre-oopness. Thought I might mildly enjoy it. LOVE IT. Can't get enough of it. Sure, it's a naval combat game with a space opera skin, but you can feel the weight of those huge, ponderous spaceships on the table. Pulling off a successful attack takes careful planning. The 'Brace for Impact' mechanic keeps you involved during your opponent's turn. And you don't need many models, keeping it surprisingly affordable for a GW game. Shame the miniatures are now out of print.

GAME: Runebound (Second Edition)
RANK: 680
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Straight out of the box and with no more than 3 players, Runebound is a playable game. But if you factor in the expansions and start playing with house rules (either solo or co-op) it actually shines.

This game does a lot for me. I grew up on Dungeons and Dragons and have kids that enjoy Fantasy adventure. This game is a great way to get the D&D experience but in a board game. Plus, my one child that does not like board games will play this one. So that is an added plus!

RATING: 6
Not bad in any particular way; it just doesn't hold my interest. This game gives me a "so what" feeling. Nothing about the design brings you down into the gameworld; it feels like you're adventuring from an altitude of 50,000 feet. The individual elements (characters, monsters, combat system) seem fine, but there's nothing to combine them into a compelling game. 

EDIT: Rating changed from 5 to 6 after playing some expansions.

RATING: 8
It's currently THE adventure/rpg game system available. It plays fairly smoothly (though the battle system seems a bit awkward). The graphics are very good. The flavor text on the cards is good. The components are of a high quality (cool "paint-able" plastic figures). There are expansions galore to make the game feel a little different from play to play. And the bonus is that the main game actually plays pretty well as a solo experience. 

The only real downside is the play time but there are plenty of official optional rules (and unofficial ones) that will speed up play. I'd never, ever play this game with more than 4 players as the game length would be intolerable. Though with 3 or less, this is a really good adventure game system.

Fun and fairly easy to play.  Combat system and a nice, smooth flow to it.  Wish there was a little bit more depth though.  For the size of the box, there weren't that many componants.  Could've had more bang for the buck.  Can't wait to get expansions.

SOLD Jan 2012! Took too long to play and we realised it was not going to get played as much as Mage Knight. 

Previous comment: A great adventure game with loads of theme, variation and choices. I had played a game called Talisman a lot when I was a kid and it is just like that though with far more depth. Did take quite a long time to play but was worth it!

I think that the World of Warcraft Boardgame ist just better in every aspect. I don't like the lack of player interaction and that there ist no real strategic character development. The battle mechanic isn't as great as the on of WoW. So overall it is a nice game, but just not as good as its younger competitor.

RATING: 5.75
I've only tried the solitaire version of the game, but overall the game seemed too fiddly and long for my tastes. I like the cards and events - but they can clutter up the play area quickly. I could see how downtime and limited player interaction would be a problem in the multi-player version. A game to play with fantasy minded friends with ALOT of time to blow.

RATING: 6
Best RPGish game of its type.  These games all tend to suffer run-away leader(s) though, so there's always a downfall.  Plus a lot of random factor.  Still a pretty fun game.  World of Warcraft board game has made this obsolete though.

RATING: 7
Still fun, but it's worn on me a bit with time.  It's takes a bit too long, there's far too much down time (unless you take turns in parallel) and the combat rolling isn't as exciting as it used to be.  It is a fun adventure game, however, with addictive gameplay.

Suggestion to shorten: Cut exp needed to level-up in half, add 1 gold to each reward, play with doom track and give everyone a free level per doom counter added.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Lots of good fantasy theme, lots of powerups for your character to collect, lots of interesting monsters to fight, and difficult decisions every turn about how to most efficiently collect experience and level up your character.  Not a lot of player interaction -- it's mostly a race game and thus a game about maximizing monster-killing efficiency.  Interesting movement system though and excellent components.

RATING: 8.25
Because sometimes you just want to kill stuff. And collect treasure. Couldnt pay me enough to play with the printed maximum of 6 players though. The downtime would be enough to make me drive a pencil through my eye.

RATING: 7
I can so totally see what people were talking about when they said no player interaction.  In some ways you may as well be playing by yourself.  I don't mind the game, but I guess I prefer co-operative or competitive games to this - it had a feeling of playing in the same room with someone who was playing a totally different game.

I'm struggling to modify this game to make it more appealing to me.  While some people seem to like it the way it is, most of the people (at least the ones I've noticed) tend to put at least a few variants in.  I enjoy more cooperative elements and anything that adds to the strategic options of a given turn.  I have more preferences but I don't see the point in listing them all here.

Runebound is a classic adventure game from Fantasy Flight Games in which mighty heroes must take on the perils of Terrinoth. The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary.

I really wanted to like this. A nice game with a bit of roleplay, great components, and a quest to save the world. What's not to like? Well it isn't fun to play. Terrible downtime and no PRG feeling. You don't feel like you are fighting a ranged combat followed by intense melee and sparkling magic - you feel like you are rolling against 3 numbers of on a card. It's just statistics. No magic, no fantasy, no nothing. 

I have played it a few time with different groups of players and so far noone I've played it with has asked me for another go. There are so many great games out there - skip Runebound!

1st play - I had played this system once long ago. It creates some interesting narratives and is a fairly streamlined system, but unfortunately it goes up against Mage Knight on the heavy end and the D&D games on the light end, and those are better games. I could see playing this in the right circumstances, but I wouldn't request it, though I enjoyed my play of it, and the plentiful expansions are a plus.

Game has fair theme play, it is generic and could be better.  Found the semi-random movement system (by dice) to be frustrating.  Player interaction is minimal.  Game also lacks a catch up mechanism.  The combat system is quite involved, which leads to extremely painful downtime.  The components are of excellent quality.

Sort of talismanic gameplay a bit more balanced but with the irritating-est movement dice mechanic I've seen for some time. May be more of a lifestyle game than I really want, as variety of scenarios seems key to avoiding boredom as the encounter decks don't have that Arkham Horror level of variety.

All games have been with the "standard" rules, with no variant, the game is too long (6 hours for our second game). HOWEVER, it looks like the "recommanded" variants will help reduce the lenght of the game. We will have to try it out.

Wander around and kill stuff then take their treasure and gold. Pretty basic stuff but still a decent game. I'd play this over Talisman any day. There are plenty of expansions both large and small to keep the game interesting. Docked half a point for playing time.

RATING: 7
I was debating whether to wait and buy the new fantasy flight version of Talisman or this.  I bought this not having played it before and have no regrets.  It has all the same draw of talisman but with slightly deeper game mechanics in terms of movement and combat (though Talismans flavor cannot be duplicated). I expect and desire this type of game to take a long time to play.  That is not a negative at all for me.  However this game should be played with the quicker Runebound rules and the doom track as it does seem to provide the game with a reasonable pace while also encouraging players to take on harder challenges.  The game is very accessible as long as you have played through it once and is easy to teach.  I am definitely looking forward to what the expansions will add to this.  A new cornerstone of my collection that will probably get a higher rating with more plays. 
  
UPDATE: Bought some expansion decks and like how the game feels with the added content.  This game has a better fun factor than most. After repeated plays I find I really like the combat system in spite of its relative simplicity and the inevitable "push your luck" factor in combat is great at creating tense moments.  But without regular added content(which there is a ton of)staleness sets in rather quickly.  This is an ideal game for kids, they cried when I said I was thinking of selling it. Had to back off quick.

не уверен, что стоит брать в аренду. может быть потом как-нибудь. 

NB: по отзывам Descent полностью "убивает" Runebound.

RATING: 7
A fun high fantasy game with plenty of enemies, events, items and allies. The artwork, miniatures and overall presentation are great. Although there is only one objective, each experience is different. The character building and graduating to higher level encounter decks can at times seem like a bit of a chore. The gameplay can be drawn out and there is a lot of downtime between turns when there is more than two players.

Originally, I got into the idea of trying Runebound 2 when I saw a review fawning all over it as a great adventuring game that feels like an RPG. I was galvanized to try it once Runebound 3 was announced and had apparently simplified the game and thrown out a lot of cool mechanics. What I would learn upon trying Runbound 2 is they were thrown out for good reason...

The multi-tiered encounter system is lovely. In fact, I am not sure how RB3 is going to make this work since it was so elegant here. Unfortunately, every encounter feels exactly the same. And that's all the game is: encounters. You move around, trying to kill as much as possible to buy things to kill more. Pretty typical RPG slog. 

Unfortunately, the combat just gets old so quickly. There are three phases, you roll dice, you use dice in the three phases, you repeat. There aren't many interesting decisions. You just sort of solve a mini-puzzle every turn (the same one) over and over forever and then the game ends.

This could be slightly enjoyable with someone at the table who adores it and is just incredibly enthusiastic all the time or who really gets into creating a narrative for everything. That's what we did for the first...30 minutes. After that, it felt really forced and the mechanics just stayed the same forever. RB2 is slightly boring, I don't think this will make it to the table much.

Meh. It's a pretty pathetic adventure board game. Kinda boring, and not very inspiring. 

Primary issue:

* A sense of reward comes solely from acquiring new items. That sense is definitely diminished once one becomes overly familiar with the range of possibilities.

* The movement, though innovative, is left lacking due to a sense of sameness about the board. Aside from access to different towns, being on one side of the map doesn't feel any different than being on the other. Yawn.

* Combat is a bit boring, especially with an audience.

* End game slumps.

* Most events/non-combat encounters feel tacked on just to break up the monotony of combat.

* No really cool special abilities between characters.

* Player interaction is minimal.

I still play it, but only because it works solitaire and it (barely) scratches my adventure board gaming itch. I suggest Arkham Horror over this mess.

Runebound keeps it simple and streamlined. The idea of building up through nastier levels of monster to a climactic confrontation with their evil overlord is quite nice.  Having said that, the theming of the basic set felt pretty generic. As many others have commented, this is not a game to play with more than three, otherwise the down time gets significant.  The long playing time will probably keep this game from appearing on my table too often. I prefer my RPG substitutes snappier.

Now a days I dont have time for RPGs. But this is close enough, and doesnt take all day. Good sologame. 

Its a bit clunky, the rules are somewhat unclear but its great fun to explore the world and to level up. Buy new gear and hire allies. 
I don't need the new third edition, this is absolutely enough for me. 

It plays best with two players, to much downtime with more...

RATING: 5
A classic adventure game where players kill monsters in order to level up, get money to buy better equipment and then go kill the bad guy. Of course there is a lot of randomness involved. Rules are easy to teach and gameplay is quite funny at first but the game drags a lot. If it lasted for an hour it would be great but 4 hours are way to much for a game of this weight. There is also too much downtime in 4 player games. Still you can find some homerules to shorten the game duration and make it tolerable.

RATING: N/A
Boring enough. Nice ideas, badly implemented. What Runebound needs are not multiple exapnsions, but a better set of rules for a game that WOULD have been nice, but that actually is a long, tiresome, aimless dice rolling evening.
Excellent components, however, and the idea, I repeat, is good.
Talisman is WAYYYY better.

An adventure game much like Talisman but perhaps a bit more strategy involved as it's not simply drawing cards. About 5 of the expansions were added prior to playing. There are 4 levels of quests to do, world and individual events and some nice quirks within the game. A nicely packaged game except the plastic figures which are terrible, but that does not spoil the gameplay. It will get a lot of plays in the upcoming months and beyond.

I guess you could call it "Talisman on a hexagonal playfield". That means it takes a long time to finish.

Movement is nicely done with special terrain dice.

Fun and simple adventure game which is supported well by both the publisher and community with a flurry of add-ons which customize the game for various playstyles.  Suffers from significant player downtime however.  While this base-game by itself really isn't all that great (good for a solo run through, but tedious in multiplayer), the expansions do a great job of enhancing it.  I'm hoping that variants like The Frozen Wastes and the Mists of Kamigawa help bring this out to the table more.

RATING: 4
The concept seems like something I would like, but the game is a huge disappointment.  Under all the appealing chrome there really isn't much of a game here, and what there is takes way too long to get through.

There's ultimately one core decision to make in the game -- should I draw an easy monster for low risk and low reward, or should I draw a harder monster for high risk and high reward?  Then you roll the dice to see if you are successful or not and then repeat and repeat and repeat.

The problem is that combat, the heart of the game, is one-dimensionally dull.  All there really is to do is build up your three stats.  You might do this through equipment, allies, special abilities, or level-ups, but it's all essentially the same thing.  Get the numbers as high as possible to improve the odds of winning when you roll the die.  There's no real decisions or trade-offs to make or creative strategies to employ.

The innovative movement mechanic really doesn't amount to much.  You either get to where you want to go or you don't (and you try again next turn).  Since most items, monsters, and events are revealed randomly there really aren't many decisions to make about where you want to go -- just go towards the nearest encounter.

And there's almost no player interaction.  One player might get to a resource that another player would have liked, but that just means he'll go somewhere else instead.  You can attack each other if you want, but since combat is so dull it's again just roll the dice and see who gets to take who's item.

This lack of player interaction also means that there is very little for you to do when it's not your turn except watch and wait.  The bland world map and mindless combat means that there's not much to do even when it is your turn.

The game is way too dependent on dice rolling, in my opinion.  Plus, once you get too far behind, it becomes nearly impossible to catch up.  When you can't beat the green encounters, and all the green AND yellow ones are gone, you're in a very very bad place.  

Some characters are a lot better than others, which doesn't help.  

I think the game would probably be more enjoyable as a solitaire game, to be honest.  I've not tried it though, but I can see it being pretty fun.

RATING: 7
This is a hard one to rate. Sometimes I feel this game is perfect and sometimes the odd combat system, run-away- leader problems, and long downtime between turns gets me down. The bottom line is if you are a fan of adventure games your game collection will not be complete without Runebound, and if you are not this game will certainly not change your mind.

A somewhat clunky, cranky, fidgety Dnd-ish dice-rolling adventure game.

It does get some things right:  the map, the progressive degree of difficulty of foes...

Then it gets some other things very wrong:  rolling dice for (possible) movement through terrain, unbalanced items for sale/acquisition at markets...

And the combat system is just . . . odd and repetitive.  Unfulfilling.

Yup.  Take it or leave it.

RATING: 8
A very thematic play experience that really feels like an adventure.  Game play can be very long, but the play experience is solid throughout.  The Doom Variant will help ensure a "sudden death" that will help keep play time shorter, but expect long times especially for early plays.  Players have very interesting choices throughout and face tough challenges at all levels.  Luck is a definite element of the game.  Very good theme and surprising variety in replay value.  A very solid (re)design.  [GTI Code: TPCD]

I like this game but after a few plays without any expansions the game gets very stale.  My wife calls it 'a dice game' and in many ways it is.  In general the game is a role-playing-light competitive board game.  Most of the expansion decks and boards will refresh the game and will give more options but until you get the Character Decks the game is still a race for Levels and Loot.  The Character Decks bring the ratting up at least a whole point for me as the game is a lot less predictable with them.

1 play so far. Pretty intuitive gameplay, small simple manual, does all the work for you. After the first 4-5 turns you rarely reference it again.Nice (though frustrating from time to time) luck-based movement mechanic, takes a bit to get used to the symbols on the dice to hasten playtime. All in all, a solid fantasy ameritrash adventure game with all that implies.
UPDATE:Few more plays now,the real challenge is to introduce the right kind of house rules to make the game more interesting and keep tension up throughout the play, otherwise it slows down after the first half and until the climax(more like 'thank god, there's the exit').Luckily enough, this game has sooo much room for house rules and variants. (if only i could find the time..)

An adventure game I enjoy much, although it is in dire need of many official/unofficial modifications.

It is of course with some mechanics/cards from the expansions. The item costs are unbalanced. The red challenges could be more complex but the adventure variants address that issue well. It has one of the best combat systems that provides many strategic choices and interacts very good with the equipment. I also like the great illustrations and the fluff of the story (Vorakesh.. Margath.. those bastards! :D )

Since it provides a complete adventure experience I consider this the reference adventure game to which all others are measured as better or worse.

The house rules I apply:

1)progressive level up experience: First 2 levels cost 2 xp, then the cost increases by one. 2,2,3,4,5,6...

2)something to compensate for bad movement rolls:
Setup: each player receives a random ritual with cost 4 or lower from the rituals and runes expansion.
Each 3 movement dice may be spent (even after rolling) to remove one fatigue.

3)categorize the market deck to 4 decks: armor, weapons, miscelanneous and allies. The hero may choose which deck to draw from.

Runebound is a more challenging and sophisticated version of Talisman: an entertaining light adventure game, full of randomness and... fun!

The game is essentially a multi-player solitaire race to character enhancement, with the ultimate goal of defeating the final boss (or three dragons). There's not much to do in other players' turns, so Runebound really works with a maximum of two or three players (otherwise the waiting times would be enormous).

For what it is, it works quite well, and it's definitely entertaining, without taxing the brain.

Very good adventure board game. Good character development and in the right mood it is a blast to play. Nonetheless it can run out after a while because there is no interaction between the players.

And I am really missing quests in the game. And because of that one game can take a long time without seeing the end of it.

For now I have to test PROPHECY but up until now I have to said that Runeound is the best adventure board game when playning with 2 or 3 players.

One of the best fantasy adventure games out there. Simple but engaging combat/skills system, but otherwise rules heavy. Not for new/casual gamers. Our house rule allows the next player to start their turn when the previous player starts their adventure/market phases which greatly speeds playing time by shortening down time. Expansions allow for great adventure variety, and its never the same game twice. Can go really in depth or keep it simple depending on your groups experience. Not perfect, but never had a bad game of this.

And then there's the base game. The thing that I enjoy so much about Runebound is that is so expanadable. I don't even need the extra board expansions when the card expansions alone add so much to the game. Also, it's great solo (just use the Doom Track variant). I have also found that you can get gamers who normally aren't that into a fantasy setting (I'm looking at you, Brian!) to play it and enjoy it. On to Descent!

Pros: Excellent game, especially for solo play.  Takes up a moderate amount of space.  Has a good balance between randomness and strategy.  Lots of replay value.  Pretty plastic minis.  Recommend using the Doom Track to add a sense of impending...doom.  Lots of expansions for basically different games.

Cons: Takes too long for more than 2 players and there is virtually no player interaction, since any pvp slows the game down a lot.

One of my current favorite games, an adventure game! I love almost everything about this game, its supplements work wonderfully, and it can be a short, or VERY long game (a drawback) still, however it is fun, the sense of dread and competitive partial trust you develop with the other heroes is very rewarding. Set aside some time, go with a group of explorers, and you will have a total blast.

The second edition has improved greatly over the first edition (by leaps and bounds in several places).  I can't imagine playing the game without the extra variant rules (included officially with the base game now, and offered on the website previously when the 1st edition was available) for random encounters on the road between adventure counters, and for the doom track.  I also added in all the current small expansions that aren't new adventures, and these have added a lot of adventure variety.  (I added the expansions straightaway, since variety is the lifeblood of many an adventure game anyways, Runebound no exception.)

The market stack is now very huge, but there is a good spread of interesting items, and the items are more balanced.  You can now increase your experience in not just mind/magic/combat (which you now increase by 2 levels per counter), but also your exhaustion (2 per counter) and your life (1 per counter).  The adventures are much more challenging now; charging into the game and directly into yellow counters is a sure-fire way of spending the next few turns licking your wounds in town.  There are a lot more green adventures I would run away from, too, without at least a cheap ally and/or armor.  And fortunately, getting knocked out does leave you with your hard-earned experience points, though all your gold and your best item go away.  And nowadays, I wouldn't call Lord Margath "Margaret" without making sure he didn't hear me.

I look forwards to soon trying the adventure variants (the two small and the one big, currently) and class decks.  I most eagerly look forwards to the new slew of small expansions (hopefully more in the realm of adventure cards than market cards---the market deck is frighteningly huge right now, and I need to pare it down myself) and the big Arabian Nights-style expansion.  Fortunately, nowadays hunting Lord Margy is enough even for me.

This is an enjoyable adventure game. It's great with two and fine with three.  With four players, it starts to get a little bit lengthy.

We tend to like the expansions that simply add new cards over the ones that change up gameplay.  It's a simple, straightforward game that doesn't need to be too dressed up.  I have heard it's a competitor for Talisman, and though I haven't played Talisman, I haven't heard the best things about it.  This little game, however, is one of our favorites.  We've played it probably the most out of any of the other games in our collection.

I don't have time for Magic Realm but I want something to scratch that itch.  Runebound does it for me.  The expansions add so much variety and replayability to the game that Runebound can be whatever you want it to be if you find the right combination of expansions and optional or house rules.  In short, it is an above-ground RPG rolled into a boardgame with plenty of fun and adventure as well as replayability.  It is a fine game on its own and aa great game once you find your personal sweet spot on how to play it.  It may be that it cannot really accomodate large numbers of players, but I plan to play it with no more than 4, anyway.

RATING: 9.9
My favorite fantasy game.  This game is superb.  Another Wallace game that captures a light version of adventure and RPG.  The rules are easy to learn.  I would play this game anytime.  My favorite solitaire game.  

For me, the fun of Runebound was taking a weak hero and making them more powerful, using experience, items and allies. It's more about the journey than the destination, to use an old cliché. The game evokes so much theme through the flavor text, the use of weapons and allies, that I just have a blast every time I play.

I enjoy fantasy roleplaying games, and Runebound  keeps me thinking about it long after the game is over. Each game is a story:  you develop your hero in skills and weapons and then you win the game by slaying the Dragonlorand.  I am always willing to play this game. Players seeking a confrontational game in which they can constantly effect what their neighbor does may be disappointed, but those seeking an RPG experience in a board game will likely have a good time.

While a bit on the long side, this is a fun fantasy adventure boardgame...I like it much more than Prophecy, Talisman (bleck), Return of the Heroes (barf). It is surprising how many games of Runebound have come down to just a few turns...for a three hour game, it can get mighty close at the end.

We have always played without pvp combat.

I guess I purchased too many expansions for this game...they didn't increase my enjoyment of the game all that much.

One of the many challengers to Talisman's crown of best fantasy adventure game.  Runebound showed lots of promise and won the favor of many gamers.  However, the ruleset features that typical, early to mid 2000s FFG bloat.  The game has too much downtime and just doesn't play smoothly.  It's a great game, but I'd never play it with more than 3 people.  Sadly it fell upon it's own blade while Talisman continued to live on stronger than ever before.  If FFG were smart they'd bring this baby back with a new svelte 3rd Edition.

Pleasant, Talisman-esque fantasy boardgame. Players assume a character and chart a career with the ultimate goal of foiling the forces of Darkness. The characters roam the land gaining skill, experience, and valuable prizes in fairly disconnected and inconsequential engagements (at first) and then learning more about the plans of the "villain(s)" as they choose deadlier encounters-- which is pretty cool. This may mute replay somewhat, although knowing what lies ahead matters little: the plot of the villain(s) won't progress any faster than the table wants them to. The game appears to be best with three or four players. Any more and the downtime become a serious drag, which can lead to a deflating sense of the game being little more a lather-rinse-repeat excercise. Still, I much prefer this to Talisman. And even Prophecy. Rating may go higher with repeat plays.

Moving the starting location toward the middle of the board was a good idea.  Otherwise, it's very similar to 1st edition so I've snipped my comments from 1st ed.-->  Ulgh!  Luck-heavy.  Dicefest.  I agree that it's a race game hiding behind a fantasy, character-development theme.  Game is fairly repetitive.  **UPDATE**  The more I play, the more annoyed I get with the randomness of market cards.  The markets have usually been wonky in our games... all items and no allies... or all expensive things and nothing cheap.  The cards that let you steal items from opponents (or let you destroy their items) seem unbalanced.

It's okay. I'll confess that I've only ever played this solo but my feelings have been confirmed about the game at each sitting. The mechanics represent a bulking up of a character who wanders around the wilderness fighting monsters of increasing difficulty to buy stuff to fight a big baddie at the end. I realize that I've just described many fantasy themed games, both good and bad, but with Runebound the formula is exposed in an unappealing way. This game was released before Fantasy Flight began adding more ambitious mechanics into their games; the theme needs to be the selling point. And it's not. Set in Terrinoth, we have cartoonishly depicted humanoids and monsters about which you're given a blurb. Nothing comes together thematically; I just can't be encouraged to care about any of the people, places or baddies because the it's a cursorily contrived setting which defers to mechanics, which defer back to the nonexistent story. It could be that the other small and big box expansions do something to aid this, but I think the Runebound experiment ends here for me. There are just too many other worthwhile fantasy games to explore.

Great RPG game , not difficult and lots of weapons and heroes to choose from.

Adventuring done semi-solo. I guess the PvP element was roughly implemented. I'm afraid it's not very well-balanced, but anyway it has lots of options. Unfortunately, the fluff didn't make it to my expectations.
Yet, on a plus, it can be customized to a huge extent.
Has an abundance of expansions to add to the flavor of the experience.
It's nice to come up once in a while on table for a cool enough night.

We recently tried Runebound, and are quite happy with the game.  It's a nice, light adventure game, and a welcome addition to gaming nights when we don't want something as heavy as Descent or Arkham Horror.  It's not a game that we play weekly, but we quite enjoy it and highly recommend it to people that like adventure games.  It's also quite simple mechanically, and easy to teach; would be a fine game to pull out when non-gamers are present.

Runebound lost it's appeal after a few games where we waited forever to get the respawnable encounters to respawn.  Made for a long and frustrating experience for everyone.  Traded it away.

Well I like the interesting version of the roll and move system. Otherwise the game is just not interesting. Move somwhere, draw a card, roll three times, thats it.
Sadly neither the storytelling nor the gameplay works for me. Maybe "strategic" level (the real adventuring is done by a couple of die rolls, game is about leveling up of character) fantasy games are just not for me.

Got heavy into this game.  Own every single big box expansion and every card expansion (minus the character decks).  Really enjoyed the new maps and mechanics that came out with the big box expansions.  Enjoyed marketing and finding new items to equip my heroes. Most of my games played were solo games.  In a multi player game it often felt like everyone was playing different games of solitaire.  Even with some game mechanics encouraging player interaction, it rarely ever happened.  Some people in my gaming group basically gave up if they got KO'ed once.  They felt it put them too far out of the game to come back to have a chance to win.  Got burned out with this game.  Not enough depth, lots of randomness.  But then 3rd edition came out...

I've been wanting this game for a long time and I finally took the plunge and bought it with some Xmas gift cards.  Unfortunately, I also got Heroscape for Xmas.  Runbeound feels like a cross between Arkham Horror and Heroscape.  It is an RPG-lite boardgame with the ability to fight monsters, level up attributes, acquire weapons and items, ... and that is about it.  It's not bad, takes up less space than Arkham Horror and plays a bit faster (with the doom track) so I will probably hold on to it and play it on occasion; however, I'm glad I bought AH first and waited on Runebound.

The components of this game are simply wonderful! The board is nice to look at, the cards are of decent quality and the miniatures are pretty and detailed. But it's a turd dressed up as a wedding cake. Here's whats wrong: 

- It's too long: I don't mind long games, actually I really love long games. Most of my favourite games are on the long side. But all of them have their own dramaturgy. They develop into different games throughout the course of the game. With "Runebound" nothing really develops. You just get more of the same. And this doesn't keep me interested in the game for such a long time. It took us four hours completing a two player game which was essentially the same during its last rounds as it has been during its first rounds.

- It's baggy: There's a lot of text on the challenge cards, which could make for some interesting mini story lines, apart from that it doesn't. At first we read out the text loud. After the umpteenth encounter we didn't anymore, because it just didn't matter. The combat values on the card matters, but what kind of monster you are battling and why? I don't care. Gimme the gold and experience points - next player.

- It's a lot of stuff dealing with even more stuff. During the course of the game you collect stuff from the challenges, you pick up items in towns' marketplaces, and you get some allies as well. All of this adds to your abilities as a fantasy hero. But it's hard to keep track of all these modifiers and special abilities, as they are distributed among lots of different cards.

- There's no drama: Nothing really develops from the game play. There is no story, apart from the event cards, which sort of set the frame for the game. But after one play you're through with them. Even the final battles are just the same as the first battles - the challenges are just more powerful, but that's it. It's a numerical difference, not a semantical one.

- The challenges are interchangeable: After the first few you don't even read what's on the cards anymore because it's boring. The challenges don't add up to a story. They're just numbers. Nothing else. "Oh, I have to fight a coven of bloodthirsty Hospatossas who devoted their lives to the Uberbaddie? I don't care. What's their combat values again?"

I can see how this game has its fans amongst fantasy afficionados, role players and LARP fans. I'm not one of those and I won't play this overproduced sedative disguised as a boardgame  never again, not even if you threaten to kill my daughter's puppy.

After one play, I'm interested enough to consider buying it for solitaire and 2-player play.  Wouldn't play it with more than 2 because downtime would be significant.  Would definitely benefit from more powerful weapons.  Update:  I like it less each time I play it.  The game seems to play itself.

Really good game! Thanks to the countless expansions, you feel in a endless world. In every game you´ll meet creatures and find items that you haven´t seen before. About 70 playable heroes and six different maps. The game focuses completely on combat, wich bugs me sometimes. In Talisman in comparison, there are more strangers or secret places to explore. Still, the combat system is one of the best that I´ve ever seen: it´s simple, but it requires a little bit of planing. Therefore I can live with the lack of other events (there are a few by the way.) I think I prefer that for solo play, using Mr. Skeletors great solo rules.

With one play in the books, I'm loving this game. In our 2p game, we played nice, and the game was a blast with each of us wandering about doing our own thing.

We mistakenly overlooked the importance of building up for the final reckoning, and as a result, the end brought a dose of humility. My one concern is that it might become repetitive, but there are a heap of characters/items/etc., so I'm guessing we're good for the foreseeable future.

Now, I need some expansions. Look out, checkbook. It's comin'...

Amazing fantasy adventure game! Great dice driven mechanics for fighting and world treading, excellent leveling up and character advancement and the story comes through really well!

There are, of course, some problems and the game is better suited for a solo experience or a two player count, but it's also unique in what it provides!

I used to think that Terrinoth's setting was a bit too "cheesy" for my tastes but this is actually pretty acceptable!  

The base game has a sadisfactory replay value thus I wouldn't mind not being able to add the outrageously priced expansions!
(I got mine for 35euros from my FLGS in DEC 2013) 

PS. Download, print and always add the Cities of Adventure fan-made expansion, from the files section, here on bgg!!! Brings the world to life!!!

A thoroughly excellent fantasy adventure game.  This one reminds me of Return of the Heroes, but is a longer and somewhat richer experience.  Both are extremely good fantasy games.

I like the combat system in this game - andthe levelled encounters make for an altogether excellent experience.

My wife and I set this up, play an hour and walk away.  We can leave it for a day and come back with no real disruption to the game - which is excellent.

The game is simpler than the rulebook would have you believe, but a whole lot of fun.

The items, allies and experience system make this game more detailed, on top of a neat challenge, encounter and event system through which the story of the world is bled into the game experience naturally.

Great fun.

Runebound is good, clean fun - at least when you're drunk.  Not an amazing game, but when I'm in the rare mood for a hack n' slasher, I turn to this one, as it has more questing than your average hack n' slash - I played much Heroquest as a teen, and while fun, I have no desire to return to the tactical days of yore.  For that itch, I just play Dungeon Twister these days.

After ten years, I've increased by rating by one.  If you play with fewer players (no more than 3) and reduce the number of experience points needed to gain an experience tile, the game length is tolerable.  The exploration, leveling up, and loot aspect of this game are still top-notch.  The expansions greatly help keep it from getting dull.

I had a rough 4+ hour introduction to this game.  I felt there was a gulf in difficulty between green and yellow encounters which kept me out of contention for most of the game.  We eventually called the game over when one player became a runaway leader.  There seem to be character balance issues.  I need to give this game a few more plays to see if we just had a fluke game or not.  Loses a point for the fantasy theme, which I'm burned out on.

Plays longer than I was expecting.  Nice challenge level, made for some interesting story for an evening of board gaming.  Game looked like one person was on a runaway win, but in the end, though he did win, everyone was within 1 or 2 kills of winning themselves.  The end really turned into who was moving to the final challenges first, not the one with the biggest weapon.

Once you see the dice in action, and understand the phases of play, the turn flow actually goes very well.

For my tastes, this game is very well done. There are echoes of elements I enjoy in Arkham Horror here, but it remains an excellent offering in the high fantasy genre.

Excellent components and well thought-out and balanced mechanics made for a game my group can't wait to get back to.

RATING: 7
Runebound feels like a much more epic variation of Talisman.  While I enjoy both games, there are definitely certain aspects to Runebound that I appreciate far more.  For instance, gold doesn't grow on trees, and I often find my funds running short (as opposed to the small treasure trove my character seems to always have on hand when playing Talisman).  Battles are far more challenging, and there's something to be said for being able to push an ally in front of you to take the brunt of the damage (you say they are meant to help attack?  I say they are my meat shield!).

On the downside, the game can run a bit long.  Even playing the "fast" variant, where you level up with less experience, I feel that the game does not progress as quickly as it could.  It also suffers from older game mechanics.  Be prepared to roll them dice over, and over, and over, and...  You get the picture.

On the plus side, moving is pretty interesting.  While utilizing symbols on a die to determine which terrain you can move on may seem exhausting to some, I find it intriguing in that it helps make certain terrain types feel more difficult to traverse.

I've played this once, at Con of the North (so my rating is provisional), but it was fun enough so that I've traded for it. Though it can play long, and tends toward a "multiple solitaire" feel, the thematics are fun, I like the terrain dice, and the play ticks along enough to keep my interest up as various adventures are revealed and the players hurry toward their goal of defeating the Biggest Baddies at the end.

Similar in scope to Talisman (a well loved game of my youth), this is a roll and move board game with some quasi-RPG elements and light record-keeping/resource management.  A good way to scratch the RPG itch when you don't want to or can't get a full RPG session going.  I particularly like that the game can be played solo, with two-players or with a small group (definitely not more than four) and still be an enjoyable experience.

Reminds me of Duel of Ages. Better in some respects, worse in others. This game is truly painfully dull. Players' choices tend to seem very obvious and there is very little (interesting) interaction.

Especially not when you could probably get through damn near two rounds of Descent in the same time. Traded, never regretted.

This is an underrated gem. One of my favorite things about this game is the ability to take on a character and build them up throughout the game. 

There's a wide assortment of items, armor, and weapons (swords, axes, maces, bows, daggers, etc.) to choose from which is something I always like to geek out about.

I really love the terrain moving mechanics and think this game does a great job of simulating an rpg. At least the traveling aspect. The biggest problem people tend to have with this game is the lack of interactivity with other players and the time between turns. Guess what? That's like 95% of Euros. Anyways, I love this game and have heard great things about third edition so I am eager to play that one in the future.

RATING: 4
Tentative review based on one solo play and one two-player game.  I want this to be a good fantasy game but so far it seems very repetitive: go to encounter spot, kill monster, get treasure, wibble, wobble, wubble.  After very few turns you've seen everything this game has to offer.  The two-player game quickly saw a runaway leader emerge, and I'm not sure why that wouldn't happen with more players.  I'm not sure what the sweet spot is with the number of players, either, since there can be a lot of downtime for players.  Three seems to me to be the minimum one would want to play with.

But my biggest beef with the game is the near-complete lack of story progression.  The event cards seem to me to be intended to drive the overall story arc, but given that many events can be skipped the effect is uncertain.  What tension there is is generated by trying to keep abreast of the other players and not by any sense of expanding crisis.

My rating might not be totally fair as I have only played this game alone.  I bought the game, however, based on BGG comments that the game is solo-friendly.  Unfortunately, it isn't really satisfying solo.  The two biggest draw backs for me are: no time pressure (or too much if the doom counters are used) and too simplistic combat.  EDIT: sold my copy.

I like the changes in the revised edition.  The two dice normalize some of the swings of chance.  As well, the leveling up process is faster, which is good.  I like the variants as well, the timer track makes the game go much quicker.  Forces players to take more risks early rather than plodding along too slowly.  I enjoy playing this two player with my super geeky, Mur Lafferty worshipping, wife.  No downtime, and since the game is basically mult-player solitaire anyway, it's similar in play.  As with the other version, I would be very hesitant to play with more than four.  We generally play with the weaker knockout rules and quicker advancement to speed up the game.  Recommended for fantasy and RPG geeks.

Dungeon crawl with great combat mechanics.  The game has very nice artwork, gameplay is really nice and character development is one of the best of the genre.

The bad part is the game is really long to play.  Another bad point is that when a player takes the lead, he gets harder to reach and there are no mechanics to allow a comeback from players if they badly roll and miss a turn.

Anyway, a cool game if you are more about the experience than about winning.

The expansions that create different win conditions have not been a big hit with me or my friends. It is still nice to have to option to mix things up. (20+ plays)

Fantastic game.  Reminds me of some of the great fantasy novels I have read.  Love the character progression.  I always get into my character.  Can play for hours and it feels like minutes.  Will never get rid of it.  I will play this game any time (at least any time I have around 4 hours).  One of the funnest ways to spend an afternoon.  It also plays exceptionally well solo.

What a boring game.. no interaction with other players, no meaningful decisions, just dice rolling all the time. It also lacks a story or any kind of atmosphere. What a big disappointment. This is the little, ugly brother of the great Mage Knight...

Although its broken and not very balanced, I still find it quite amusing and at the time - this was one of the best role-playing board game experiences to be had (without actual role-playing, I mean adventuring in an open fantasy world). You'll need some patience and/or house ruling in order to get the most of it, though.

Wayyy too much downtime and seems just like a multiplayer solo game (something that I despise with a passion). If you want a game like this play Talisman. Downgraded from a 4 to a 2 because I would never play this game again and turned off many casuals to harder games (much like BSG but with BSG it was a TV show they didn't watch so there's more to it than just complexity and downtime on why that failed). Only not a 1 since at least 1/4 of effort was given to make it look presentable. Why does everybody say this game replaced Talisman again?

RATING: 6
This is the definition of an okay game. All the mechanics are solid enough and the game plays fine but I never feel any excitement nor care about the characters. I feel part of it is in the way the text is written, the board setup is uninteresting, and the combat system is designed for interesting choices yet I feel misses the mark.

All in all, not terrible but I doubt I'll play it much. It might be much better as a two-player game than solo since you have competition going.

I feel like I should like this game more than I do. I can't put my finger exactly on what fails to engage me. I love the theme, and I think the rules are solid in terms of game design. I just don't find that we're having a great deal of fun when we play. I'll probably trade/sell my copy, although I'm willing to play if someone wants to.

After first play (4 players) I rated this with 6 as I found it quite interesting. But then I tried to play it with my daughter and the game went worse with every session.

The only thing that is worth of mentioning is unique movement system.

A great game.  Played many times.  It's good if you're multitasking too, because you don't really have to pay attention on your opponents turns.

I found it best with 2-3 players.  Any more, and the time between turns could be a little long.

The Expansions really add to this game, with different themes and different ways to win.

Had alot of fun with this one.

Two plays.  Long.  Quite fun advancing character.  Good solo game.  Three players tops, and use an easier levelling format.

Edit June 2011:  2xp/level (first eight) 3xp/level (ninth and beyond).  Three players.  Extra market card (face down) on all non-Tamalir town spaces to start game.  Wounds healed exactly as exhaustion.  No PvP garbage.  No doom track.  Way faster, same reward.  Awesome game.

Edit August 2011:  BtB solo rules without doom track.  One of my favorite games now.  Fast and furious.  About 12 plays in now.

July 28, 2008 -- After one play, I found the game has some fun elements with some flaws.

Still, it's not a bad game, and I'd like to give it another try. 6/10

Incredible fantasy adventure game. It is a competitive game, but my group usually play it more cooperatively. The movement system may turn some off, but I personally think it's pretty neat.There are TONS of card boosters for encounters, allies and equipment, and even entire base rule variants - and they're pretty cheap if you can find them. One of my favorites.

First game I bought when getting into board games (didn't know that was what I was doing).  My girls loved the character advancement aspect, the character outfitting and market shopping, and the leveled challenge of the adventures.  They also liked the combat system.  I think I agree with them in all those aspects.  It is roll and move, but with cool terrain dice and in any direction across the map, not just in two, like Talisman, for example.  They also liked that you can challenge other players and take their stuff.

I like the add on decks.  The main expansions can be particularly deadly.

I tried playing this one solo. Good game but there are some problems with it. The doom track from the game doesn't work when playing solo. What fixes that is using the threat track from the Midnight Expansion. People have posted a copy of the threat track on BGG and rules on how to use it. IF you play this game, use the threat track, you'll have more fun playing that way.

A pretty good game that plays fairly well solitaire, well with two players, and is a good game to play co-operatively (even if that was not the intention of the designer...). It does not scale well above, though. There can be a fair amount of down time if played as designed. The biggest drawback is that it takes a big time investment. An interesting observation is that (without expansions) the item deck is heavily weighted to melee and magical weapons and very light on ranged weaponry. While the expansions I had tried address this to some extent, they are still not as capable as the melee weapons that are available in the base game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Surprisingly fun adventure game, though I've mostly played it solo with a common single player variant you'll find in the files section here. Despite having a lot of auto pilot decision making just going with the results of the dice, the decisions you do make are often difficult and player skill is definitely a large factor for success. Great replay and all around great time. Would recommend for anyone who enjoys a fantasy adventure.

Fell in love with this game when I first got it as an alternate to Talisman (350 on E-bay), and I still enjoy it. Works best with two players, anything more than that and downtime is a real issue as typically other players turns are totally irrelivant to you. Oh and it can be LONG.

I want to love Runebound but the game experience always leaves me just a bit short. It's a lot of fun to playthough! The movement is thematic, the battles are fun and leveling up is always a blast. Somehow the sense of a story just isn't there though like it is in Talisman for example. In short: a more gamey version of Talisman with less player interaction. Both are good games, the one you should get depends on your taste in these things.

Although I can understand why some don't enjoy Runebound, the interesting dice-based framework for movement and combat combined with huge variety in card decks from the expansions make it a winner in my books.

Many small choices build up, and whoever is most efficient will (most likely) be the winner. Big fan of the system overall.

My recorded play count isn't close to accurate for this game since I'm unlikely to record solo plays.

This game is enjoyable when you aren't really interested in a "game," but are looking more for an "experience."  It's fun to build up your Hero and deck him/her out with weapons and armor.  

I've seen people online complain about the movement, but it hasn't been an issue for us.  But then again, we haven't really played this competitively.

I can see how the Teleport Rune could lead to some crankiness, because someone could potentially just zoom around the board stealing encounters from other players, making the game VERY dull for them.

I highly recommend Runebound as a solo game.  I've played several solo rounds with some rule variants and it has been a lot of fun.  The level of challenge is perfect, it can be played in an hour to an hour and a half, and you really get a sense of progression and story as you work through.  I love building my character to fit the items available and the enemies I seem to be drawing.  No two games have been the same and often the game has come down to one dice roll.  I'll often find myself sitting down for a game of Runebound to relax; it's a lot of fun and has the same appeal you might find in a computer RPG, only you can go from start to finish in under two hours.

I played this at my first Boardgame Meetup. It was a good game I thought, it brought out the elements of a table top RPG without the need to write up your character. I will probably get a copy of it eventually as it was a good time the time I played it. I say it's Medium weight because it might be somewhat tough to follow if you're not an RPG person, but once that is figured out it's simple to understand.

Got 3 copies of this for Christmas 2013.

This game is a lot better than I was expecting.  Sure it's just roll/move/encounter, but it's fun anyway (though I'm sure it will get stale over time, unless I get a couple expansions).

It does take way too long though.  Our first game took four 1-2 hour sessions before we finally just said "f*ck it" and called it a loss. Once you start trying the red cards, if you fail any important rolls, it's a fast slope to losing all of your allies, weapons, and gold, and then you basically have to start over to build yourself back up again.

Hopefully some of the variants will speed it up a bit for future play-throughs.

My first play left much to be desired, but now that I know what to expect (in terms of length), I may appreciate it more.  I'm still not sure if I like this or Return of the Heroes better.  Runebound definitely wins with regards to visual presentation, and that's not sayin' much.

Now that Mage Knight is out, it's gotta be mentioned as a comparison with Runebound. Both good games, but MK is really a puzzle, while RB is more of an experience game (lots of randomness). Both games are essentially a race to level up and kill the baddie. As a fan of meatier, deep gaming experiences, I definitely prefer Mage Knight. Plus, it just plays so well solo. I like the sandbox feel of MK, whereas RB seems to somewhat be a game on rails. 

Drawbacks of RB are that it's essentially the same thing over and over. Move around acquiring "stuff" to help you kill the baddies. Kill some baddies, level up, buy more stuff, and so on. It's a race game more than anything. It's certainly fun, but I can understand why some grow tired of it after a couple of hours. And the different attack styles (ranged, melee, magic) aren't really all that different beneath the surface. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
I've only played this game once so far and I'd have to say that I wish more games were like this game -- *with a little less luck*.

The thing that does strike me about this game is its ability to inject a storyline into the gameplay -- It helps build a stronger world to play in. 

YES, dice rolls and luck play a large part of this game. YES, I have pulled the 3 strength Assassin from the green deck [The toughest Green IMHO]. YES, I have been the beneficiary of a 15 cost Armor item due to card draw, but I still felt I was tromping through a game with a good leveling up system and eventually felt like I could take on any challenge due to the decisions I made. [Although one of my last decisions ended up getting me baked to a crisp by Margoth :( -- but mostly because I only had 1 ally at the time! Silly me.]

Although I am a huge fan of little to no-luck strategy games, I think the storyline and atmosphere this game builds on is something many games in which you 'roll dice and draw cards' lack.

For people who play games to consistenly outwit and beat their opponents handily, this is not the best game to have consistent outcomes [then again what game with dice and cards usually is?] But if you're looking for a more involved game [time wise] with more atmosphere and an engaging world, Runebound has that in abundance.

There will certainly be those who feel after playing a game for three hours and NOT winning would be a waste of time - [especially when one or two dice rolls rather than strategic placement may have determined the outcome], I, on the other hand, felt it a compelling game that I would like to try with perhaps the weakest character in the deck -- just for the challenge alone.

I finally got to play a full game of the 2nd edition this weekend.  I definitely like it better than the 1st edition.  Much  more tension in the 2nd because the Challenges are more difficult and Healing is more expensive in 2nd ed. However, this seems to make the game longer but game length generally doesn't bother me in adventure games like this.  I also like that skill rolls are now made with 2D10 instead of 1D20, this makes 2nd ed. a little less random. The movement dice are nicer in the 1st edition though...and the Shadows of Margath expansion needs to be tweaked to be used in 2nd ed.  Talisman 2nd ed with expansions still has  more variety, but it looks like FFG is going to support RB with lots of expansions.  I classify it as a Light Medium weight game because of the 'fiddley' rules.  Not a lot of strategy involved, but very fun.  I suspect my rating might go up, my only reservation is game length at this point.  It's definitely a game for the weekend.  I'm a sucker for these adventure games!

The solo play feels a little funny.  You don't get to interact with the other players, unless you want to attack them.  You can't go adventuring together, or work as a group.  I'd rather play Descent, which is in the same world, but more of a co-op dungeon crawl.

Drags on far too long for what it is, and is quite repetitive. (Just like real RPG video games!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very colorful, with nice graphics and cool flavor.  Of course, it suffers from the limitations of the RPG-Boardgame genre -- at heart, it's a dice-rolling exercise with only minimal decision-making.  If you like that sort of game (Talisman, Heroquest, Return of the Heroes, etc.), then you'll almost certainly enjoy this.  If you don't dig the genre, then stay away unless you're really in the mood for swords 'n' sorcery.

The game also has a serious downtime issue, with very little player interaction -- with 4 players, we passed the movement dice to the next player so he could roll and plan his move while the current player resolved his turn.  Otherwise, it would have become very dull very quickly.  I imagine that with any more than 4 players, it would really be excruciating.

RATING: 10
This game is a great adventure game.  It really does play somewhat like a multiplayer solo game, but it is fun to experience your quest and witness the others too.  If you want lots of player interaction, this is not the game for you--at least the way we play the game.  I would not play with more than three.  Too many players creates too much down time.  Having a second set of movement dice is a huge plus.  Sometimes we play with the lighter knock out rules to make risking higher level encounters less risky.

I'm a sucker for games that are basically Dungeons & Dragons in a box. The story and theme are brought to the forefront in this title through the interesting flavor text on the cards. The art is good (although town icons could have been more obviously paired with their corresponding card piles). It is fun to collect goodies that allow you to destroy the creatures that gave you trouble early in the game. It is supported with tons of expansions to extend the replay value. I like the feeling of hero progress, although I wish the pacing was faster (you sometimes end up spending all the gold you received from battle in order to heal yourself). I wish it was cheaper or free to heal in town or something to prevent the game dragging on. I would play it more often if it was shorter (speaking of the 4-player version here).  Personally, I would prefer an action point system for movement, but ymmv. None of this keeps the game from being a blast to play and I would recommend it to fantasy gamers.

Nifty 2 player adventure.  Assemble a crew and kill stuff.  Feels like crayon rails but with combat.  The movement system and market stacks work well and the doom track pressures risk-taking.  DOWNGRADE.  Some bad luck led to frustration.  I blame the crappy expansion decks I included.  UPDATE.  Variant: two draws at each market step.  DOWNGRADE.  This really is a crappy game you can kinda have fun with sometimes in spite of itself.

Like a "D&D" wilderness adventure without all the design work.  I dig the movement mechanism and the variety of characters, weapons and creatures but the fantasy pastiche is pretty generic and unflavorful.  A fair amount of downtime between turns here and perish forbid you play with someone who suffers from analysis paralysis.  Still diverting and pretty fun.

OK, so now having played other RPG/dungeon crawl-style boardgames, I can say that I like this one the best so far.  I particularly like the way the dice movement system works.  However, I also have found that, IMO, RPG's/dungeon crawls do not translate well to boardgames, and that I really don't care for them - especially the big box-lots of plastic minis types exemplified by FFG.  Just not my cup of tea.

I decided it was time to add new games to my collection and new games for my group to try. I reviewed the best fantasy board games and this came up. Little did I realize that it was OOP, but luckily for me I got it and several expansions at original cost. I absolutely love the game. It is not as good as Talisman, one reason because it is not time friendly to large groups, though Talisman is a long game. Runebound feels like you have to rush your turns to get the game at an enjoyable length. I would not recommend playing this with more than 3 players. 3 and under it's great!

So totally the great character adventure game that everyone needs.  Running around getting cool stuff and fighting dragons and feeding them dwarves to dodge their fire breath.  So much better that WoW in mood, combat, and interaction.  (That last one is a little surprising.  Turns are still played separately, but during the other players turns you are watching the fight and cheering on the monster instead of in WoW where you take their turn planning yours and not paying attention.)  The fighting and items and quests and powerups are so much more interesting here too.  I won by feeding my ally to to the dragon, playing an artifact for a double attack, and turning in a quest reward that let me skip a phase of combat to get back to the phases I was good at.

Great game when you're in the mood for lots of theme and lots of chance! Dice chucking fun, but with more than three players, way too long.

We now play with the following movement variant to speed up the game:

Players get 6 movement points (MP) on each turn, subtracting 1 for each wound above 2.
* Cities/Roads/Plains cost 1MP (max 4)
* Hills/River/Forest cost 2MP
* Mountains/Swamps cost 3MP
Cards that grant movement dice rerolls give an extra MP instead. Players may spent N+1MP to regain N exhaustion.

We also play with a variant that divides the market deck into separate stacks for armor, weapons, magic items, and allies. During the market step, a d10 is rolled to see which type is added to the city deck. Players can also choose one type, draw 3 cards, and may purchase as many as they can afford.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I cannot imagine an expansion or set of house rules that could make this a fun experience. If you want a RPG-type game, go try Descent or a similar tactical game. It is a long long game with only a few meaningful choices. There is little play 'style' or marginal decisionmaking at all; go to the nearest adventure location, flip over the card, and roll dice. When you are hurt, go to nearest town and heal and use leftover money to get stuff. Rinse, lather, repeat.

The second edition vastly improved the game balance and progression.  Now gold is in short supply and you need to be sure you are strong enough not only to win challenges but to take minimal damage doing so.  Talisman will always have a place in my heart, but this is now my favorite RPG-type boardgame.  I particularly like the 4 different encounter decks that allow you to take on greater challenges as you level up your character.  This is my favorite epic dungeon crawl type game.

UPDATE June 2016
I finally revisited this game after many years.  I played 3rd edition a little while back, and really enjoyed it, but it was a different game in many ways, so I did not think it would replace 2nd edition for me.  I like the way 2nd edition lets you chose the difficulty of your encounters and this is a huge leap over Talisman and the like.  However, I fear my gaming tastes have evolved over time, and I no longer get much thrill out of the move, draw a card, and roll dice sequence, no matter how thematic.  Firefly the Game failed for me not too long ago for similar reasons.  You roll high you win, you roll low you lose,and that's about it.  All the variety boils down to a different picture over the number you need to roll.  I have grown to want more, and games have grown to give me more.  

My shelves now contain Eldritch Horror, Runebound 3rd, and my beloved Assault on Doomrock, all of which offer a more interesting game experience and challenge resolution mechanism.  Original Arkham Horror is a contemporary to Runebound 2nd, but has held up better, I think, thanks to its more interesting decision space, even in the face of its epic fiddliness.  Runebound 2nd will always have a warm place in my heart, but I don't know if there is space for it on my shelves any more.

Otherwise, an enjoyable Fantasy adventure game.

RATING: 7.5
At first I wasn't sold on this one. It felt random and fiddly. Draw a card, read the text, make some random check for this or that, procede. But as our game went on and the number of items, allies and undefeated challenges mounted, I started to see where this game shines. 

There are indeed tough and relevant decisions to be made, and making the right choices can be a challenging and rewarding experience. I found the overall story plot to be a bit cheesy and unoriginal, but overall the flavor text and artwork combine admirably to convey the theme. I soon found myself having fun, almost against my will. And gaining that next level always seems just a turn or two away, so I found that I kept wanted to push onward, onward... evidence of a good design. 

The game is not without its flaws. As others have pointed out, it can go on too long, and it's basically a multi-player solitaire excercise. No, it's not perfect, but it's still better than I was expecting. And I like it more than Dungeoneer.

This is the first board game that got me into the hobby.
Bought Runebound without knowing anything about it(I am a fantasy theme junkie though) and I loved it.

Excellent solo play and excellent 2 player game (haven't played it with more than 2 players).
With so many expansions and variants it never gets boring.
The only downside is that it is out of print, so expansions are hard to find and expensive.

Easy, relaxing and simple game to get your fantasy fix!!!!

Enjoyed my first game. Played again two days later. Looking forward to trying out the different expansions.

Recently got 1st edition in a game trade. Will try it out with my brother and see if likes it. If so, I will look into getting my own 2nd edition copy.

Very glad I got a chance trying out this game out. Been a long time since I heard of Runebound, but never got a chance trying it. Glad I did. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Reason I got myself the 1st edition. I'll see how it goes with it and how many times it gets played. I know a few people who got the 2nd edition.

Game is interesting and is a very good role-playing boardgame. I want to play it again soon. Martin Wallace can do something good outside of Warfrog which is cool.

Okay, I hate to drag out the most over-used and abused phrase on BGG, but here it is:

Multiplayer Solitare

It's not a cooperative game at all. My game group had two tables of four players each playing Runebound Second Edition, and there was so much downtime for individual players that we'd walk over to the other table, and chat about how their game was going. One table finished after 3.5 hours, the other called the game at 4 hours. 

The theme seemed nice, but as a player I resented the time/money sinks placed into the game. If you died a lot early, you were pretty much behind the rest of the game. We were playing with cheaper skills and "soft knockouts", and it still took too long. The movement dice are the overly frustrating tools of the devil.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Good.  See?  Ameritrash games can be multiplayer solitaire too!

There's some good stuff though:  Awesomely dark feel, hilariously corny flavor text, but oh-so-long.

I'm beginning to think that the "D&D as a boardgame" is as ephemeral as the "Civ Lite boardgame" -- in both cases, an integral part of the experience is that fact that you invest a huge amount of time into your character/civilization.  Trying to pare it down to 90 minutes or so also removes the emotional buy-in that makes it click.  Runebound takes forever, but due to the downtime in a multi-player game, you don't actually invest all that much individual time in your own character.

RUNEBOUND EN CASTELLANO ¡YA! GOTY!!! XDDD

Llevamos la partida a mitad (descanso para sobar) y me parece sublime, justo lo que buscaba un juego de aventuras con sabor rolero!

Aplicamos mal alguna regla y el juego se nos hizo largo, igualmente quedando pendiente una partida más correcta (y usaremos el "Doom Track") lo puntúo de sobresaliente.

Después de jugar otra partida con 3 jugadores, nos encanta a todos, aunque tuvimos que dedicarle dos tardes para terminar la partida. Encantados y enamorados con el juego, voy a pedir un par de expansiones más :D

Enjoyable adventure boardgame when served with 2 and 3 players (takes about 3-4 hours). Adding a couple of Challenge (Terrors of Tomb) and Item decks (Artifacts and Allies) is recommended to keep the game fresh over several plays. I also recommend using some house rules: Market deck variant (Smithy, Tavern and Enchanter), progressive leveling (XP required for leveling equals to the # of level you are aiming at: 2, 3 ,4...), death during escape results softer Knockouts, hiding rule and Caves expansion, to add a few. Currently started to play with Sands of Al-Kalim variant.

Runbound 2nd edition is quite different than 1st edition.  The game is more difficult for the players, and I have been seeing quite a bit more 'knockouts' than in 1st edition.  Equipment is still king and it's still very much a fanstasy adventure game.  Regarding expansions: The market deck expansions add so much to the deck, that I have been considering a house rule of drawing 1 additional market card... otherwise there is the tendancy to not draw enough xxxx.  The amount of additional heroes is such that we draw 3 to start and pick one; then everyone reveals their hero at the same time.  We have added the adventure cards to the deck and play as 'normal'.  The character deck expansions add a lot of potential interaction; but so far it's been that... potential.  Not many abilities are used to allow the potential, in our experience.  Regardless, Runebound is a very enjoyable game.  The character decks add *much* to the player interaction.  Otherwise, it's pretty much a solo race to the end.

Love this game but it has some flaws, the game can outstay its welcome on occasion with games dragging. Sometimes its slow players, but often its that a player just cant quite kill the big baddies and win the game, you could play the doom track but I think it would lead to too many game which dont have a winner which to me lacks satisfaction. The expansions are great for adding diversity to the encounters but you have to rig the decks to make sure the event cards come up at regular intervals or else you can run out of places to go on the map, the gems run out. The player versus player stuff also drags out the game so we tend to remove those cards which is a shame because some more interaction would be nice, but slows down the game, even using the faster runebound option in the rules.

I got into the whole Runebound thing early on in my re-entry into the hobby in 2008 and fell in love with it. It brought Talisman back to life in a much more interesting way, and with a bajillion expansions, it seemed like a great system to invest in, which I did. After enjoying many plays, I eventually sold my collection off somewhat regretfully in order to raise funds for some unexpected bills, but in truth, my playing had dropped off considerably. Still, I think it's a great choice for some.

The game delivers as an immersive adventure that picks up where Talisman left off by taking you on a ride from Average Joe to Junior Badass to Total Badass. The combat system is interesting and dangerous and forces you to balance your character's stats. You collect items that confer all kinds of crazy offensive and defensive benefits. The fun is going on the ride from picking your fights carefully to knowing you're a wrecking crew with the coolest stuff that fears nothing.

As others will tell you, the game is best for 1-3 people. I preferred it with 2P and with house rules. In fact, one of the strengths of the game is that it totally lends itself to variants and house rules. I preferred rules that made people level up more evenly and only able to purchase items 2x their current level. Basically, I used a modified variant of Sonnenblume's rules changes that you can find in the file section. Depending on how random you want the game to be or not, I guarantee you can house rule it to your satisfaction, and I highly doubt that any two people play RB the exact same way. 

I said above that my playing had dropped off and that was because I lost my primary RB partner, and just as I was organizing things in preparation to re-enter the RB world (possibly solo), I discovered Mage Knight which is a different type of adventure altogether, but one that has got my full attention. When some bills came up, I decided to sell my RB stuff as a lot of it was OOP, but I'd still happily sit and play the game given the chance.

With its shallow and repetitive gameplay, Runebound understandably turns off some people. To me it's the board game equivalent of the old NES Dragon Warrior games that I loved as a kid. Grind. Kill. Tool up. Kill. Die. Tool up. Then return to that failed encounter for sweet, sweet mindless revenge. With that mindset, it's an always enjoyable adventure game, and the race aspect adds needed tension. My biggest complaint is the not with the simple mechanics but with the flavor of the base game. It has an uninspired genre fantasy coat of paint that I dislike. I much prefer the slightly darker Terrinoth of Descent or DungeonQuest or the "traditional," more literary fantasy theme of Magic Realm. Best as a two-player game since PvP can slow the experience to a crawl while producing a runaway leader; however, without PvP you are playing parallel games on the same board.

Neat concept. It has all the makings for a great adventure game, and the terrain dice [i]seemed[/i] like a cool and innovative idea. However, relying almost entirely on the results of dice and card draws for everything you do ends up making this take WAY too long and becomes frustrating. Not to mention that the punishment for death is brutal. Gonna have to try some variants next time in the hopes that some them allow the game to move along at a more reasonable pace.

Thought it would be more fun but it's still decent. Minis, beautiful components and a fine battle system. Plenty of expansions. The base game dries up in about ten plays so yeah, I'd love to add something already.
UPDATE: It certainly has grown on me. I enjoy it more with every play.

Good amount of variety.  Really fun, open ended adventure game.  Didn't care for the movement mechanic, and found the dice mechanic for combat uninteresting.  In spite of not liking them, I did find the mechanics very well balanced.

There are so many things wrong with this game.  First off, though I played without the doom track, it's LONG.  Really long.  And there's a serious runaway leader problem.  But even if there wasn't, it would still be pretty lame, because the number of meaningful decisions is minimal.

One of my first buys due to the theme of the game and the nicely sculpted miniatures. We've enjoyed it pretty much every time, altough I only recommend playing this with 2 people. 3 if you have a lot of time on your hands and your willing to wait out your turn. You could probably speed up gameplay with adding some homebrewed houserules or checking the forum here.

This game is more fun everytime we play it.  I've also played a solo game using the Doom track variant and it played in an hour.

We're looking at house rules and variants that get this game down to 2 hours or less with 3 players.

I believe the sweet spot for this game is 3 or less players.  Everytime I've played it with 5 the game took 4 or 5 hours.

I realized the other day that several of the people we have played this game with in the past now own their own copy as a result.  It hits the right mix for some game players.

What a fantastic game.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys light RPG style character builder and adventuring.  The turns move fairly quickly, the combat is fast, and our average games with three to four people usually conclude in about 2.5 to 3 hours.

As said many times in other posts, the 2nd edition is a large improvement over the first.

With no means of luck mitigation, Runebound often made me rage at my dice rolls. I couldn't have fun when my opponent succesfully fought purple enemies and I was stuck on failing on the green ones.

I really wanted to like this game.  Lots of theme and solitaire friendly.  In the end, it is simply too repetitive and you don't really feel like you are doing much more than buffing up for the final fight.  It is not terribly immersive despite the heavy theme and quality bits.  I thought maybe the expansions might help, but they look to be more of the same.

I was kinda iffy on this game my first play, but after my 2nd attempt I can honestly say that I love this game. I bought colored gemstones for the game which makes it look and feel sooo much better. Alot easier to find the starburst on the board using white gemstones for them. If you like fantasy/rpg games then you should love this game. There are a lot of expansions to this game which will make your gaming adventures last for a long time. The only thing some people may not like is that it is a very long game. I however love staying up all night till the crack of dawn playing a good game with friends.

I traded this away, but played it again to find it had regained some of its charm.
I prefer Prophecy slightly. Prophecy's simplicity and oh-so-quick-turns give it the edge. But combat in Runebound is quite fun, the interaction of items and abilities can be crazy, and all the expansions give it a lot of replayability.
I feel the game is better with Sands of Al-Kalim. Also, I played recently with the leveling up variant (level-up costs 1+number of level-ups you have), and it definitely speeds up play and encourages you to kill reds instead of just leveling up forver.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Second edition.  If you have 1 - 3 players, 3 hours, and a hankering for thematic adventure, this game cannot be beat.  The rating drops sharply if played with four or more.  2 Players 8.5, 3 players 7.0, 4 players 6.0, 5 players don't bother.  The game just doesn't scale well with large numbers of players.  If you own 1st edition and like it, the jump to second edition is worth the money.

A very enjoyable and highly thematic adventure game that can be played in 2-3 hours with 3 players, which is the sweetspot for me. Highlights include the free character development system, combat system that offers enough tactical choices, a good variety of different heroes, items, allies and monsters and an impressive support through expansions, both large and small.

The base game is decent, not great.  However, the Sands of Al-Kalim makes it worth playing.  Some of the expansion decks also help.

The main problem with the base game is the lack of direction.  Practically no quests, just wander around where the dice will let me and hack at unwitting monsters.  Repeat.

If you have only the base game, the Doom Track is a must.

Too soon for me to rate, but I prefer this over the recent crop of fantasy boardgames. It's got more theme, it has a story, but the mechanics are still clean.

I can see how this game would be best with 3-4 players, since there is some waiting around for turns to occur.

I like the idea of an adventure game like this. I suppose it's a much less complicated version of Magic Realm (somewhat less modular as well if you don't include the expansions.)
As a solo game I enjoy it. It DOES take a while to play, but it begs you to generate a narrative in your head as you carry out the motions. (if you're not capable of doing that, you probably won't enjoy this game.)
The ending adventure cards are ridiculous too! I have played (with the Doom track)to the end only to have my character burned to a crisp by the red-level baddies! (3rd card drawn from the end pile, difficulty was a 20, WITH bonuses (+13 altogether) it came out to be 19!! 5 damage for that one hit! That was a frustrating end to that story. :)

This game just goes on and on and on.  I think the game needs the flying dog from the movie "Never Ending Story" as a character.  Each turn is basically a dice fest with some small decisions.  You repeat this dice rolling over and over and over for 2+ hours. I would give the game a 3 except that the other players seemed to be really into the game and enjoying it quit allot.  Therefore I bump my rating 3 points, one point for each of the other three players in the game that I partook. If you enjoy D&D (I do not) perhaps you will enjoy this game.

My #2 choice for fantasy adventure boardgames. 

I really like Runebound, except it goes on a bit long at times. If you're looking for a more combat-oriented adventure game, then choose Runebound. It works best with two, and I wouldn't even think of adding more than 3, as the game would drag on for far too long if you have kids or time is tight. It works very well as a two-player game, and doesn't tend to last more than a couple of hours with just the Lady and I.

Little player interaction, and little ability to affect the other player's strategy might make this one fall a bit flat for those with a very competitive nature. This can be remedied with the character decks, but they also add even more time to an already lengthy game. 

The Lady and I enjoy it quite a bit, and it sees a lot of time off the shelf. The huge number of expansions, and sheer number of cards make this one an excellent choice if you're seeking a lot of variety in your adventure game.

RATING: 8
Enjoyable, but I won't play again with more than two players - it really drags, and there's nothing to plan during your opponents' turns.  I actually like Runebound best as a solitaire game, which takes about an hour using the guide posted by MrSkeletor (threat difficulty of 14 or 15 makes for a nice challenge).  Another reason to play Runebound solo is that Prophecy is a better multiplayer game by leaps and bounds, but doesn't play especially well as a solitaire game.  

I love Runebounds's combat system and I also like the movement system.  However, the board play is not as good as it should be.  The board's geography isn't very meaningful because the encounters aren't revealed until you visit them.  The cities suffer from the same problem: very few of the items available are known before you actually visit the location.  And since the items and allies are what will determine whether you win the game, the extreme randomness can be annoying.

I like the fantasy theme and the idea of building up a character. For me its like a board version of DnD. Shorter than the other DnD type board games out there (Descent).I like the idea of dungeon crawl mind you, but at my age I only want a game to last a couple of hours.

Alright, I've only played it once but I'm fairly confident I'll never play it again. In strategy and tactics and story and fantasy and exploration and character leveling games it is thoroughly trounced by Mage Knight.

I love outdoor dungeon crawls and this is done very well. I have the 50 bajillion expansions that go with this, but have only had a chance to use a couple of them.

I do wish there was more player interaction as you do feel like you are almost playing a solitaire game, but still this one is pretty decent. I think I would rather try Descent: Road to Legend before this is going to hit the table again though. 

I find this game very similar to Return of the Heroes. I can't really say which one I like best since I've only played RotH once.

A beer & pretzel game. There seems to be too few meaningful decisions in this, but the theme and the production makes me stay and play it, it is a good way to spend an evening together with friends. While much better than the first edition, more balanced and not the same runaway leader syndrome, it still feels like a solitaire game with alot of downtime. Played with three players are optimum.

Strictly for 12 year olds. Or, anyone who wants to remember what it's like being 12. I like the dice movement a tad, but it's also uneccesary. Beyond that, you have quests, and items, and stats. Kinda like Roleplaying, but only with the marginally interesting parts.

I like it much more than I thought I would. I'll grant that it is largely a mutual solitaire exercise, but the game generates a tolerable narrative and I like the fighting system. Playing it with more than three players is not advised. We favor the "heal all wounds for one gold" variant, which helps avoid the early game healing/gold loss spiral that can really wreck your day.

This game started out great...but the level of depth in the mechanics do not warrant such lengthy play time. The end game is a let down. I will try it again, but unless it a MUCH better experience it is comming off my purchase list.

Sure I got the rules wrong the first time I played as I was adding the gained experience as gained damage rating. Since then have played many times. Bought the Midnight expansion, love this game. Have played changing the amount needed to level up...very quick if needed, and still very fun. Always leaves me wanting more.

A great RPG boardgame with great theme and expandibility. The art and minatures are great and the dice mechanics are solid. You really feel good if you manage to win; the only major downside is that it takes to bloody long to play. I love to play this game but only once every other month, it's simply just that grueling.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable game with a Talisman and Return of the Heroes-type theme.  Your character travels around a fantasy world, builds abilities and takes on a big, evil menace. Fun game, but it does have flaws. Movement and combat are cumbersome and dice-intensive.  Waiting for your turn can become tiring, and player interation is scarce. Thus, the games tend to drag on and lack suspense. The game system could have been simplified and still have retained the same feel.

RATING: 7.1
Great adventure game!  Works well as a 1-2 player at least (will find out how it plays out as a 3 soon).  Easy to learn, plays out well...seems like you are playing solo though...to counter this, we had your opponent play out the adventure cards to get some interaction.

Look forward to trying some of the expansion decks.

This is a lot of fun 2-3 player, but any more and downtime is a bear.  You have been warned!  The clunky terrain dice movement mechanic bogs the game down some, but it is bearable for 2 players.  Pretty good fantasy story feel.  But the small box expansions, except for Crown of the Elder Kings and the class decks.  Crown makes you fight other players in a combat system that doesn't work very well PvP.  Class decks make for more interaction, but add a lot of length to an already lengthy game.

RATING: 7
Roleplaying adventure boardgame aimed at the gamer who grew up playing Talisman, or those who would have loved it had they not been too young. The game system is very neat and the special movement dice help to severely reduce the randomness of movement, allowing you to more easily plan your route.

Despite the fact that we already had the first edition of Runebound, I had heard so many good things about the second edition, and with the release of all the new expansions, I just had to get it. Having played it a couple of times, I'm pleased to say I'm not disappointed. Fantastic revision of a great game.

Can drag on a bit long.  I want to love this game.  There's a lot to like about it.  But the more and more I play it, there seems to be no speed up in the game.  With 5 or 6 it DRAGS.  Even with using 2 exp for upgrade, it still turns into a 4-5 hour game.  Part of the fun is reading out (and to a little degree acting up) the cards.  But, IT ALWAYS gets to a point where you are starting your move before the next person finishes.  So, you no longer really see what's going on with everyone just you.  Making it a Solitaire game.  This rating is for 4 players at 5, I'd drop it to a 6 and with more then 5 players I'd rate it a 5.

A game I like very much. Light but not too light, always entertaining, good ole monster bashing and treasure hunting. Wonderful artwork and great balance between rules complexity and subtlety.

Also while there are more than enough monsters the amount of equipment and allies you can find  is colossal, particularly with a few expansions thrown in. That definitely is a plus in my book, as is the product support FFG is giving to this game.

And in my opinion the game is best played with Doomtrack on, with three to four experienced people and with no combat between heroes. That way it doesn´t take too long, stays competitive and provides a moment of great social entertainment.

Based on two plays - fully expect this to go up to 10 once we get the rules 'off pat' and the games speeds up a bit. 
Four plays now, as expected, up to a '10' (from 9). Love it! 
There are a few tricks (see forums) to speed up play which was an issue to start with but I reckon we should be able to consistently finish in a 3 hr evening without having to resort to 'tie-breakers'.

The Game has flaws and is not perfect, but it gives me the same feeling as realms of arkania where a big chunk of the game is travelling on the map and all the stuff is happening. The perfect Solo experience, but not recommended for multiplayer because of the time each player needs for his/her turn.

If you are willing to overlook the too long playing time, the boring rules that must be houseruled, and digging the theme and nice maps and endless stack of encounters (thanks to extensions), you might have fun with this; I sure do but I wish the game system was better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a good game.  It's a light adventure game where the player controls a party of 1 to 3 characters (1 Hero and up to 2 Allies).

The combat is pretty straight forward, as players add 2d10 with their ability rating, and compare that number with the creatures rating.  This may easily become monotonous.

The market mechanic is interesting, as players visit towns where they may purchase items, hire allies, pay to recoup stamina and/or health, not to mention sell items (for half price).

The players control which ability of his/her Hero will be upgraded when he/she reaches the next experience level (required XP varies based on number of players).

The XP provided by creatures varies depending on the deck it came from: Green = 1, Yellow = 2, Blue = 3 and Red = 4.

The game may appear to be long at first when you are learning to play, but it quickly becomes intuitive.  Even Player versus Player combat is pretty easy.

Adding expansions will be rather straight forward, so there is no need to worry about replayability.  Creative players could easily design their own adventures, creatures and items!

Awesome game that can be modified and customised to your heart's content. I play a lot of 2 player with the wife as each extra player adds a wedge of time onto the duration. Six players is a little silly unless you have all day free. More players = more downtime too. This isn't too much of a problem for me but many younger players don't have enough patience.

RATING: 8
Using the dice to map your route certainly helps you decide where to go next, and adds a bit of an epic adventure feel to it.

It does help to either use a variant that quickens the end of the game, or one of the little expansions, otherwise the game can be quite aimless until your characters are strong enough to attempt a red card.

RATING: 8
Great adventure game. Lots of fun and the expansion packs won't break your bank account. This gets pulled out regularly in our group. Cards and dice with little strategy determine your fate, but the story makes it a fun adventure if you get into it instead of just playing for the points.

[Initial Impression: 2; Unlikely to play again]
I was excited to be playing Runebound - it's by Martin Wallace, a designer I regard highly, has an appealing theme, is very well produced, and I'd heard good things about it.  I came away more disappointed than I think I've ever been by any game. In short, there are almost no meaningful decisions, the theme wears off quickly, and the game just wears on and on.

First, the good: Runebound is dripping with theme, and players will enjoy reading their cards, describing the events they encounter and the monsters they are fighting, and there are some tense moments when you're not sure whether you'll make it out of a particular scrape.  The game is very well produced, with colorful and appealing bits (although the hero minis would look a lot cooler if they were painted).

That's it for the good, now the bad: If ever there was a dice-fest, this is one (and I'm generally okay with some random elements in a game, as long as you can meaningfully affect or react to that randomness).  Dice control movement, by showing the terrain types you can travel over.  Dice determine the effects of most events and the outcome of every battle.  Because you gain upgrades, the dice rolls needed to beat the harder baddies are about the same as the necessary dice rolls for the earlier battles, so there's not much feeling of progress or of escalating tension.  There is almost no player interaction - you just happen to be moving your heroes around on the same board, and another hero might get around to buying an item you wanted first.  It is possible to fight one another, but players progress at a similar pace, so it would be generally unadvisable to risk your spoils to pick on someone else.

Finally, the ugly (and it's quite ugly):  The problem with the dice controlling everything is that it reduces the meaningful decisions to almost zero.  The only real decisions (and even these have fairly straight-forward choices) are: 1) what to buy (although there are some obviously superior items), 2) when to start attempting harder challenges (when you're breezing through the current level adventures), and 3) what to upgrade (get enough on each ability to protect yourself, and then concentrate on your most damaging attack).  The other "decisions" are what dice-limited route can I take to get to an adventure or city on this turn, and when (if ever) do I try to escape an especially powerful monster?  The movement dice almost break the game.  I once spent 4 turns not moving anywhere meaningful because the dice didn't show the terrain types I needed. It might be possible to improve this aspect by assigning movement points, and have each terrain type require a different number of points to enter.  As for the battle system, I felt like you were just hoping for the right number or higher to come up on each dice roll - you could play essentially the same game with a deck of cards and a pair of dice: flip a card, and that's the number you have to beat with your dice roll.  I will say that the game is initially fun, for about 30-45 minutes, as you read off the cards and get immersed in the theme.  After that, however, I realized that the theme was just a veneer for the dice engine, and even the other players (3 of whom did say they enjoyed the game - their reasons, incidentally, were "you don't have to think too much", and "I like that we can talk during other players' turns") stopped reading all the thematic card text and just started saying things like, "I need an 11 to defend, and then an 8 to make the kill".  And that's how the next 4+ hours progressed (the full game took just over 5 hours).  I was bored, bored, bored.  After all the players finally worked up to the hardest (red) challenge level, the third red challenge was the game ending Lord High Whatever, which provided a brief moment of tense battle - the hero was relatively weak going in, but was able to use some items and got some lucky dice rolls to win fairly easily.  Even she said she didn't feel like she deserved to win (one of the other players had a much stronger and well-armed hero), so even the endgame felt randomly determined.  This game might be okay for an hour or so, but it is an insanely long and boring slog (and we were playing the "short" version).  I read the "Doom Track" and "Hazard" variants, and both seem like they might help the game.  The "Doom Track" seems especially essential, as it adds a variable turn limit - and anything that would shorten the game can only be good.  Finally, the feeling of low player interaction is overwhelming.  You sometimes have to wait quite awhile for your next turn, watching others roll dice and announce their results, and I felt it just didn't matter what their result was - it wouldn't change my actions in any way.  We were passing the movement dice ahead so that each player could plan their movement in advance, and I think the game would play just as well if everyone had their own set of dice and just rolled simultaneously and announced their actions.  The rules say you can play with one and I think that may be the best number to use.

I never thought a Wallace game would be among my lowest-rated, but this is the kind of game experience I would pay money to avoid.  This rating is admittedly based on one play, but sometimes that's all you need to make a valid judgment - and it's highly likely that I'll never have a second play.

RATING: 8
Great game with exceptional support and development from FFG. I would not recommend more than 3 players and in my mind it has a sweat spot of 2 players, and using the Doom Track is very worthwhile. If you like role-playing, talisman or just fantasy in general you cannot go wrong with this game. The cards are very much like a CCG and offer the main core mechanic and variety to the game system.

I have made some home rules including improving the money, loss after death etc. One of the main changes is the way I use market decks as shown in the Martin Knight variant.

When a player visits a town he must choose between the 5 Markets (Weapon Smith, The Armourer, The Tavern (Allies), The Enchanter Store (Relics/Artefacts), The Market Place (for cards that are drawn during the standard market step). This gives the game a huge amount of flavour, keeps the items flowing and also incentive for players to travel from one town to the next.

Also take a look at the file QuickRunebound.pdf... excellent suggestions to improve the game.

Adventure! There's a lot to like about this game. You go on encounters, get some fat lute, get xp, and kill more monsters. It's like a video game on its own. So far, I'm liking everything about this game. The components are great, although the cards could use better art. Yeah, I'm an art snob.

The main problem with the game is that it's basically a single player game. The amount of time waiting for your turn is atrocious. Roll, decide what you want to do, encounter, decide how you want to face it... it's way too much to wait. 

If you're playing this as a single player game, you'll have fun (I did), but when I introduced it to the group, it came across as a bit stale. The only real interaction comes in with the PVP, and although that's great, the only real reason to do it is if you can win against your opponent. It's a unique feature at least.

Runebound could have been a great game, if it were not for just a single problem: The fact that the developers forgot that it was a board game.

I start out enjoying this game, but always end up feeling frustrated. The game is way too long, but the Doom Track fix forces an artificial and anti-climactic endgame. The movement dice concept seems like a cool idea in theory, but in practice tends to bite mightily.

My initial rating was a '9' but it's steadily decreased since then.

Problems include (but are not limited to): crushing downtime, trivial choices, multi-player solitaire, telescoping playing time lengthens dramatically with each additional player even when using the Doom Track, requires house rules out of the box to make it playable, but the number one negative in my view is...

Dice rule all. If your character is tough but you roll lots of 1s and 2s, even wimpy green adventures will knock you out. On the other hand, if you consistently roll 9s and 10s, even a first level character will beat red adventures! The game is entirely about rolling dice, and so has more in common with Craps or Yahtzee than with fantasy roleplaying.

This could have been a great game with lots of theme flavor. Instead, mighty battles are reduced to "I need to roll an 8 or higher here."

No comment made on initial play. I recall that it was a rather long and drawn-out affair, but the final battle was exciting. In that regard, it reminds me of Arkham Horror, but this was way better.

Update (10/01/11): After meditating on this for several years, and having played Talisman, Prophecy, Dungeon Quest, Duel of Ages, Arkham Horror, etc., I can appreciate what this design is trying to do. The scale is more worldly, as I feel like I am wandering about a large fantasy-world, going from encounter to encounter. Talisman is a roll-and-move in the purest sense, and thus feels like Monopoly, although you can go in either direction. Prophecy feels like a hybrid between Talisman and Runebound--the "world" is a circular track, although the movement is deterministic (no dice). I may be talked into revisiting this once again.

[center][size=6][COLOR=#878787]LIFETIME GAME [microbadge=28495]:star:[microbadge=28496] "PLAY FOREVER"[/COLOR][/size][/center]

NOTE:  Rating is for the [i]Runebound[/i] system as a whole—the base game, with nothing but the "Rise of the Dragonlords" adventure, pulls a solid 8.  It soars to a 10 when considered with the plethora of expansions, especially the Adventure Variants (each with a different overarching plot).

A fun adventure game system from the "pull a card, read the encounter, roll some dice" family.  Can be boring with dull people—it requires a certain amount of storytelling ability to make it interesting:

Q:  [i]Why do you get a plus to Diplomacy after you kill the Hill Troll?[/i]

A:  [i]Because you made a backpack out of his scrotum, that's why.[/i]  

Be sure to read all the flavor text aloud—dramatically—for best effect.  (This isn't really optional; the plot is gradually revealed through the flavor text as the players progress through the adventure decks.  On balance it's less "flavor text" than it is "story".)

Plays best with 2, though I might be persuaded to play with 3 if everyone is knowledgeable and peppy and takes their turns with preternatural alacrity.  The claim that it plays with 6 is a cruel joke that we fell for exactly once, never to be repeated again—it ate [i]an entire day[/i] to no good effect.

UPDATE:  We managed 9 plays of 1st Edition, and that was without expansions.  As this is a "Saturday afternoon" game (taking several hours) that means we got somewhere around two months' worth of Saturdays out of it.  Two months of solid play off a single scenario.  With all the scenarios FFG pumped out for this—12 total—the replay value blows through the roof, soars into orbit and then takes a hard left into a magical wormhole.  HUGE amount of bang-for-buck!

UP-UPDATE:  Tweaks that make for more gaming goodness:

1)  Use the "shorter game" rules, making it easier to level up.

2)  Use "softer knockouts" to prevent table flippage.*

3)  Separate the massive market deck into three piles:  the Tavern (allies), the Smithy (weapons & armor), and the Bazaar (a catch-all for familiars, magic items & artifacts).  This allows players to really target the holes in their kit/entourage without endless turns of market-stepping loads of junk they don't need.

4)  Ignore PvP.  We found it just slowed things down and lead to hard feelings.**

[size=7]*After too many rounds of bad rolls and bad beats I [i]finally[/i] manage to scrape together enough gold to buy the magic sword that dovetails neatly with my special abilities—only to get my ass kicked by a wild boar and lose the sword.

**After too many rounds of bad rolls and bad beats I [i]finally[/i] manage to scrape together enough gold to buy the magic sword that dovetails neatly with my special abilities—only to get my ass kicked by you and lose the sword.[/size]

While these tweaks speed up the game, I'm not necessarily saying the game [i]needs[/i] speeding up.  For a lazy Saturday afternoon (especially a bad weather one) this game expands to fill the time nicely.  We've found that the above tweaks will take an afternoon game and turn it into a evening game—and that just means we get to play more!

(Second Edition) After disliking the first edition, my friend and I rewrote the rulebook.  We came bizarrely close the the 2nd Edition rules.  I am really warming to the game, and will be purchasing some expansions to give it more legs. 

Update:  After playing some of the expansions, this game continues to be a good time.  I think you have to play to "enjoy the ride" rather than be concerned about balance issues, etc.  Go buy stuff and kill stuff.  

Another update:  I have taken out a few cards from the deck which I consider to be "less than fun", and the game is really starting to hum.  It's a terrific solo play as well, using the Threat rules from Midnight.

Yet Another Update:  I typically only play this solo and 2-player now, and I have developed an excellent variant using the character decks as an "AI".  It's getting played a lot, and I still want to collect the expansions, so that's a good thing.

Call this one a more interesting Talisman.  There's virtually no player interaction, a fair bit of randomness and the game gets a lot longer as you add players.  The randomness is controlled somewhat by allowing players to select the level of their "adventure" and combat rolls can usually be modified.  If you like the "adventure game" format, Runebound is a good choice.

RATING: N/A
When I first played it, it was cool. It has since then died off as last resort type of game. I think mainly it's because it's not cooperative and the characters often will get so powerful that its not a challenge anymore. Towards the end everyone will be talking about Frisky Dingo or  something while one person plays their turn, and it grinds the game to a halt b/c no one is paying attention anymore so they don't know when its their turn. We don't game to take turns playing a solitaire game.

Variants I'm trying:

***Starting Gear:  A card worth 1 or 2 gold & 3 or two gold, repectively.

***Players always receive 5 movement dice (even when wounded).

***Faster healing: 2 gold in town heals all wounds & fatigue on hero.  To heal an Ally costs additional 2 gold per Ally.  1 gold heals 1 wound & all fatigue.

Then, when outside a town, can allocate movement dice to try & heal before moving.  Each die symbol that matches terrain heals 1 wound from hero or Ally.  The remainder of dice are used for movement.

***Can always move 1 space even if movement dice don't match.  (But can't move if don't roll ANY dice to move - e.g. heal.)

***Recover Fatigue after rolling:  You may choose to rest after rolling the movement dice. Roll all the movement dice you have available and then, if you choose not to use any of them, remove fatigue at a 1 per die basis.

***Toughness: need wounds to exceed life to KO hero or kill monster.

***Travel Hazard:  If end turn in a empty, non-town space roll 2 movement dice.  If neither matches the terrain you are on: Night Hazard.  If either matches then travelling salesman: draw one card from market deck & may purchase! 

Night Hazard: Roll D10 - 1-2 Green, 3-8 Yellow, 9-10 Blue.  No before combat, can't escape on first round, no reward, do get experience.

***KO:  Lose next turn - just stand character up with wounds = health.  The turn after they can start trying to heal, etc.

***Experience: XP needed = next level.  Start level = 0 so need 1 for first advancement.

***Market Step: Each turn each player will take a market step, regardless of whether the character is in a town. At the beginning of the game, place a token next to the Market stack for Frostgate. During the Market step, if the character is in town, the Market step takes place as usual. If the character is not in town, advance the token to the next town’s Market stack (moving down the board, then back to Frostgate), then draw a Market card and place the card in the Market stack indicated by the token. So, every turn, one town will receive a new item for purchase.  In addition, to simulate the volatility of the marketplace, each town’s market will only carry one of each type of good. One Ally, one Armor, one magic (Artifact or Rune or Ritual), and one Weapon. Basically, the first word on the card in the bold print identifies its type. If an Item/ Ally card is drawn of a type which already has a type available in that town’s marketplace, the new card replaces the old, and the old is discarded back to the deck. This may cause an item to be removed from the shop when a character is in a town during a Market phase! This can be a real disappointment when a character travels across the map to hire an ally, only to find he's left town that very day!

***Equipment limits: Unchanged - two weapons, 1 armour, 2 allies.



Boardless variant I'm keen to try some time: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1075181/card-game-variant-for-runebound



Another market variant:
[q="nelud"]1. When a hero enters a city at the beginning of market step he reveals cards one by one until their total printed cost exceeds his money (instead of drawing single card). He sets aside these cards, but treats them as though they are in the city market.

2. When he finishes his market step, he must place in the city market one most expensive card of those set aside (that remains not purchased). He discards others of those set aside cards (if any).[/q]

Oh, boy.  Okay, I played this when I just wanted to go to sleep and the game suffered accordingly.  All the same, it seemed pretty excessive.  The rules were rather complex for a dungeon crawl, and it was really difficult to make any progress with the attack cards and random attacks flying around.  (1 play)

RATING: 4
A game in the same vein as Talisman, you roll, you movement you make few decisions. There are decisions here, mixed up in a lot of purely mechanical action, but sadly not enough to keep me interested. I think as a solo gaming experience it might be quite good or perhaps if your group is into talisman. I just can't see it having tons of replayability or me having much desire to explore it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If you want heavy, not quite roleplaying but more of a hack-and-slashing and dice festing experience set in a nice fantasy setting added with character developement and item shopping, you can't be too far off your target if you go with this one. The mechanics are a bit clunky on some areas though, which leads to unneccessary down time. And I would rather play Descent with Road to Legend Expansion, but that's a whole different kind of gaming experience.

Recuerda al AD&D si juegas con hasta 3 jugadores (máximo recomendado encarecidamente) y a los Librojuegos de Altea Junior de mi infancia en modo solitario debido a que toma elementos de ellos: misiones, acumular tesoros, objetos mágicos, mejorar el personaje. Supera a Talismán al no tener el movimiento tan lineal. PROS: ¿Acabar una campaña rolera en unas 3 horas? Inmersivo. CONS: Escapadas en solitario (se resuelven con la expansión de Class Decks). Sin apenas interacción. Aleatorio. 

Permite dar rienda suelta a tu imaginación con las house rules. Recomiendo:

- Usar variante "partida corta" para facilitar el ascenso de nivel (experiencia para el siguiente nivel= nivel en el que estás +1)

- Dividir el mazo de mercado en tres partes: Taberna (PNJ´s), Herrero (Armas y Armadura) Bazar (todo lo demás) así el jugador elige a dónde viajar para conseguir lo que quiere.

- No permitir luchas de jugador vs. jugador

RATING: 8
Runebound is a good game but heavily mired by its absolutely ridiculous length.  This game is way, way, WAY too long for what it is.  Other than that, there's a nice feel of character evolution and more than enough theme to drown in.  However, the constant dice chunking can get old, the movement dice idea is pretty stupid (what was wrong with action points?), dying can be a huge set back, interaction is lacking, and the downtime is annoying.  Despite all of that, I still think it's not bad and wouldn't mind playing again if there were some way to really speed it up.

Update:  This is my average rating.  Solo with a threat track, I give Runebound a 10 (mainly for the ability to "pause" whenever you want).  As a co-op game with two, I give it a 9.  The game as written with two to three players is a 7.  If any more players are added past three, my rating pretty much drops a point each time.  I still want to know how Martin Wallace designed this.  You mean the Martin Wallace who created Age of Steam, Byzantium, and Tempus?  That Martin Wallace?!

High fantasy fun with easy rules and plenty of expansions for infinite variation.  A perfect "Gateway" game for those who love fantasy theme but are uninitiated in the ways of designer boardgames such as "Descent: Journeys in the Dark" or "Dungeon Lords".  While not much strategy is involved, and player interaction is limited, there is still fun to be had here, epically for inexperienced gamers who are interested in trying something beyond monopoly.
Runebound was my first game from Fantasy Flight Games and my introduction into the wonderful world of Ameritrash style games.  As such, it holds a special place in my heart and still sees the occasional return to the gaming table.

Exclusively play solo with Mr Skeletor's doom track variant.  I have had a lot of fun with this over the years but i'm beginning to feel like I've experienced everything that this game can provide.  It starts as a bit of a cakewalk and all of the decisions are pretty easy.  I think it would be incredibly dull as a multiplayer game.  Most of the fun really comes in the final battle when you have many allies and items at your disposal and you are going up against difficult odds.  Traveling around on the map gives me a sense of epic adventure, as simple as it is.  I use the wandering monster rules and 4 xp/level variant.  At this point I think that there are better solo options out there.

A good Roll and Move game where you get to kill monsters and Level your character. It works well as a 3-4 player game. I wouldn't go over that for there would be too much down time.

Despite all of its repetetivness (-> repetitive gameplay) and the lack of fresh/original ideas - surprisingly - it's fun every time I play it [and I'm not a big fan of fantasy-adventure genre].

EDIT:  The base game progresses too slowly (-> too little gold to gain by defeating the challenges).  Basically any expansion which introduces new adventure cards, improves it.

EDIT2: Sold.  Reasons:
- the mechanics is not so interesting (and tedious in the long run)
- I have no co-players
- the game is not suited (without home rules) to a solo play.  And the mechanics presents dilemmas nowhere near as interesting as they exist in other games in this mode.

RATING: 7
Rating is with 2 or 3 players most. I liked this game actually and wish I would have bought it YEARS ago instead of waiting to get a deal on WHQ which never happened.  Everything to make a good D&D like adventure game is more or less here.  Movement dice are kind of silly but they work mostly and I think I’ll forget about how much I don’t really like them eventually or just houserule it.  Not crazy about a static map but it works.  

I liked combat and I liked how you could travel to certain towns to buy things.  Monsters being staged was good.  Very simple overall with little decisions to make, but that seems to be how all these games are, explore/move, hack & slash, level up, repeat.  Overall a nice adventure game for 2 or 3 players, not sure about length and whether or not it can be tweaked yet.  Love that expansions are simple card decks which are cheap and add lots to the game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Reasonably satisfying game. The combat was a big let down, losing with unlucky rolls several times at the start can really take you out of the game immediately and there is no way to control that. Made the adventure element feel frustrating instead of exciting. Otherwise, the game provides great progression. Looking forward to the 3rd edition.

Too slow with a bunch of people, and parts of it feel really generic.  Still, some of the expansions perk it up nicely, and with a couple of folks who know how to keep it moving, reasonably entertaining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Seems pretty much the same as the 1st edition with some minor changes.  Was it really worth all the aggravation of reprinting? I love the game except for the leveling up at the beginning of the game. Why does it cost as much and therefore MUCH easier to level up late in the game???  In every fantasy game I've ever played it was much EASIER to level up quickly early on and it required more and more experience to level up in the higher levels.  House rules are MUCH needed regarding this, it's really what drags the game out so long. 

Well, that and the movement dice. There had to be a better way, it just takes too long to explore all the options of your movement dice, especially the AP prone. I bought an extra set of movement dice just so the next player can roll their dice and start thinking about their turn too.   

Stick to three players, four at the max, otherwise the game drags very slowly and there is a ton of downtime between players.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2010)

First Wallace game I don’t like. I like Talisman so I thought I would like Runebound. My first and only play was with 4 players and it was way too long, but the irking part was the down time between turns (I don’t mind a long game) maybe playing with 4 was a big mistake. I have to say that I really like the movement mechanics and the theme is great. In conclusion I have to play this again but as of now (2011-20-07) I think the max players the game can handle are 3 but maybe it plays better with 2.

Paul and Diane borrowed it and I realized that I had not updated this listing since I bought the game!

In short, I think it's a fun game. I don't play it with more than 3 and I mostly tool through it solo. I like all of the expansions giving it life. It's a pretty good fantasy game and has simple rules. It scratches an itch and it works well. I like playing with the Doom track and the Random Encounter variants.

My 3 favorite fantasy games in this model (no order to the 3): Runebound, Return of the Heroes, Dungeoneer.

Good system, interesting battle system. Not working for me mainly I prefer variability through expansion on current map, not buying a new map and replacing the original one. Not exactly the type of game I love as there is a possibility of runaway leader, very long playing time and very low direct player interaction during game. Having said this, it is nice for solo game or 2-player game though it is my preferred way of playing board games because playing solo is rather boring, i love real player interaction.

RATING: 3
First playthru was fine (6) but bored on second play (5)due to lack of depth in the monster deck and there is no depth to the different heros, skills don't get used often enough and the 3 core stats of Ranged, Melee and Magic are the same for all heroes, especially once you have leveled a bit.  Will only play this using the shorter varient which requires less XP to lvl. 

Rating lowered to a 3 after playing D&D Wrath of Ashardalon, which gives far more character customization and monsters that activly seek you out.

This push your luck adventure game plays very well, king o the genre IMO. Instead of the "test your luck" gameplay of Talisman, this game has strategy, choices and story. Aspects that allow or far better immersion at the cost of the crazy stuf. Oh and great artwork helps too (only played Talisman 2nd ed)


Bought for solo and 2-3 player "coffee and good times in the afternoon" - games 

Also a lot of the smaller packs for variaty. And Class decks. Thought I might as well get what I could while stock lasts

Played again after a while and I think that Mage Knight has put this game to rest for me. While I still appreciate this game as a simple, straight-forward, game of leveling-up - the decisions and mechanics are lackluster compared with some newer designs. I don't dislike this game by any means, but it tends to get repetitive and to over-stay its welcome. I think it is time to stop collecting expansions and just let it all go.

Looks a bit dry, but pulls you in as you play. Movement dice produce some very odd moves, forcing players to go through mountains, swamps etc because they don't have right roll to follow the road.

RATING: 5
I seem to like Talisman better.  Comments for Dungeoneer mostly apply here as well.
I just can't get excited about Runebound - its the most processional of the 'adventure' games and the slabs of 'story text' are frankly dull. In addition, the most innovative part of the game is regarding movement rather than combat. I really could not care less about movement: A system where each character can move X spaces where X is their 'speed' or whatever - that system is just fine. The excitement in the game should not be around if you rolled a 'mountains' on your movement dice ... ho hum. The excitement should be in the combat, which I admit none of the games do well, but at least WOWTAG has the character decks which add some fun and decision making to combat.

Wow, was this boring. High quality production values and good art, but no player interaction at all. And game play is little more than "move, draw a card, do the one obviously best thing to do, repeat". Bleh. I would have given it a 4, but decided to give it kudos for at least being colorful and high quality.

Enjoyed this game with a friend when it came out and bought 4 expansions for it.  I also bought it because you could play it solitaire.  However, it just hasn't gone the distance.  The game tends to descend into moving and rolling dice and it also takes way too long to play for what it is.  It's got some fantastic artifacts, items and followers but lacks interest and length of play ruins 'joy' factor.   I found Descent: Journey's in the Dark a much better game.  I ended up selling  this on Ebay.

RATING: 4
This game includes several of my least favorite mechanics in one really brightly designed and attractive package.  Played as designed without any variant or rule changes, those are:  

1. Lots of downtime:  Turns can be long and the more players you have, the worse this gets.

2. Omnipotence:  Chance across a certain combination of items and you become nearly invulnerable in combat.  I've seen this happen in nearly every game I've been involved in, such that usually someone ends up running away with the game. 

3. The Permascrewed "Oops" factor:  I've found this game to be very unforgiving of mistakes or deaths, generally, in that once you fall sufficiently behind (or even behind at all, on occasion) it's game over, and you end up sitting through round after round, plus downtime, when you have no chance to win or possibly even compete anyhow.

#3 isn't bad by itself (one of the better games I've played, Power Grid, shares this), but in combination with the other "flaws" and longer game length this isn't a game I enjoy playing very often.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A decent game of its type; nice for solo play (even though the box says 2-6 players). (In)famously, the game often runs much longer than advertised on the bok; extra movement dice and/or rolling movement while another player is playing are probably good ways to address this. The Doom Track is a poor way to speed up the game, and it's well-nigh impossible to use solo; the Threat Track (available in the Midnight expansion, described on FFG's Web site, and re-presented on BGG) is a superior alternative that can help keep the pressure on. Player interaction can be very low in this game; class decks may help here (I don't have them). Expansions generally enrich this game, although it's developing expansionitis for me, with 18 small decks and 2 large expansions available now or soon (as of 8/06) and more on the way.

12/28/07: Traded this away, along with the 10 small-deck expansions I had.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really only played solo once so I'm not qualified to rate it. This seems like the next "Talisman". There are a ton of expansions and that looks like it will really open the game up for more adventures and storylines. Would really like to play this with a group but it doesn't look like that will happen anytime soon.
Well, I have finally played it with a group and it didn't feel much different than playing alone. Sure I had company, which I prefer over being alone, but they pretty much played their game while I played mine. The experience was not greatly enhanced with other players. It's a better solo game than multi-player.

Based on one play. Long. Low interaction. Played with 5, probably more enjoyable with 2-3 or even solo, less downtime. Played Solo, would rate the game a 6 for solo play.

I wasted six hours rolling dice for this game one afternoon. We kept tweaking the rules to speed up the game (e.g., When killed a player looses a turn and nothing else; No player vs. player; Margath or whatever the bad undead dragon was named does not heal between player attacks; etc.) and it still took six hours!

This game can become too long if you play with too many players. I would say that 4 is almost too many. But 3 is perfect. The time in between rounds can also be an issue even in a 3 player game if you have players that are prone to AP. And there is a ton of different equipment and allies that you can buy in shops. Which I love, but when players have to read each card over and over to decide where to go it can take some time. I like the game alot but sometimes have trouble convincing people to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I can see why people would like this game, and it does seem fairly well designed.  My problems with the game are more personal biases ("it's not you, it's me").  First, the game is simply too long for me to realistically play more than once every few years.  And it really seems like the type of game that gets better as you play it more - that simply won't happen for me.

Second, the rules complexity is a little daunting, though not as bad as I had feared.  Finally, I'm just not that big of a fan of fantasy themes.  So I'm probably just not this game's target audience.  I appreciate what the game is trying to do, but don't see myself playing it very often.

Very cool game. First Edition was excellent in my books, and Second Edition only improves on it. Would very much like to see a way for there to be something for players to do during others' turns, as it can feel very solitaire-like, but past that my wife and I both love it!

As my girlfriend said a few rounds into our first game: " This is probably the nerdiest game we ever played!" But it grew on her, and she got exited about levelling up and buying stuff and hiring allies. My only problems with the game concern itÂ´s scale, as I like things that are a little more up close and personal! Nevertheless a fun game, and with all the expansions and tweaking possibilities, thereÂ´s no immediate danger of playing it to death!

RATING: 6
A top-view RPG game where players move around a world map, rushing to level up in a race to beat the red quests. There is an interesting movement system attached to the game, which attempts to simulate adventurers getting lost in the world. The game is pretty simple to pick up since there aren't too many choices for the players each turn. Quests have been streamlined into 2 basic types: Skill rolls and Combat; and for this reason, the game seems to get monotonous pretty fast.

Still, this is a pretty good RPG for 1 or 2 players. Note that each player plays a solitaire game, so my BGG rating would drop 1 point for each additional player.

This is certainly a game to be played in the right mood. I think it is probably best played with 1,2 or 3 players. 4 will take too long. The first game I played we all spent so much time rushing the dice around the board to keep things moving we barely had time to size each other up or enjoy the tension of the battles. The game does hold nicely together though and I really enjoy most of the different mechanics. Consider the price of the expansions before buying, though, as the decks can get stale very quickly. If you can take time over this game and revel in the little tidbits of theme and egg each other on to tougher battles and cheat and steal from each other I'm sure this game will move up another notch. I find it a little too time consuming.

I am on a high right now for this game 2/06-? (currently 4/07, still strong with a BIG thanks to Sands...) (currently 12/08...have not played in about 6 months...still love it, however)

I am having a blast with the toughened up game and have played the basic scenario quite a few times and a couple of the Adventure Variants (although I own all the expansions)
Better than 1st ed...anyone on the fence should seriously consider upgrading here...it's worth it.
Balance issues?  Who cares, the game is fun!  And the balance issues are not anything to ruin the game for anyone, I assure you.

My only, only suggestion is to play with 1-3 players only. 4  makes for a loooong and, by the end, tedious affair.
Play solo, with a bud or, at the most 3 players.  Then it is a true 9.5 game.  For more subtract like 3 points off of the rating for me.

Very fun and engaging adventure game.  I really like to play this game solo, and it can be a fun time with a few friends as well.

The main drawbacks are that if you start adding too many people it takes a very long time to play and that there's quite a bit of downtime.  These aren't so bad if you just accept the game for what it is (a fun adventure game that sort of tells a "story" as it progresses), but that can get more difficult the more players there are.

RATING: 3
From my experience this game plays best solo. Less players is definitely better.  The main reason is that this game has an almost criminal amount of downtime where there is truly nothing to do. If you prefer a lighter, let's-use-a-game-to-force-us-to-sit-around-and-talk game this might be useful in ways other, more weighty games, aren't. This is paid for, however, by a v e r y   l o n g   gaming experience, almost rivaling some much weightier wargames I've played.

The randomness of drawing and dice can create very divergent player strengths; even after only a few rounds some players will be having a lot of fun, having very strong and acquiring wonderful things, while other players will be miserable, having been killed by a green slime or something and will be wandering around getting pummeled and desperately hoping for a weak enemy to acquire experience.

Too long, no player interaction, lame dice rolling combat.

Some flaws in this game with timing and crazy card combos people can come up with that would render every other play helpless in PvP games. Seems like its hard to get out of a rut when you're in it.
Great theme, fun to play with some house rules and some cards taken out, tons of variety too.

Nice fantasy game, strong on theme. But there are many things that are really disappointing - I miss a randomly generated board and a more intersting character development. Just choosing between three stats is not that thrilling... And the fixed board makes the game a bit boring when you played it many times one after the other. And first of all: WAY TOO MUCH DOWNTIME. Games tend to last for four to six hours in which you most time sit around waiting for other players to end their turn... The Al´Kalim-Expansion too is nice done - amazing look, but too hard (15 as starting rolls in comparison to 12 or 13 in the original runebound...). And even much more dice rolling in comparison to the standard runebound: story-roll, night ambushes, calculating exhaustion from day-travel... that slows the game down even more... :( In total Runebound has potencial for higher ratings, but the massive downtime and the very luck based character development cost many points...

Solitare game.  Can be played with 1.   Created a 2player co-op.   Rules are VERY customizable to your style of play.   Lots of expansions.  2.5 to 3 hour game. Heavy set up.

Takes forever, even though after a few turns, it is already clear who cannot win; it is an overly long multiplayer solitaire, with the player interaction being limited to beating each other up from time to time, and even this is not handled by the rules all too well.

Is it long? Yes. Is it unnecessarily expanded beyond what even the most rabid fantasy gamer would ask for? Yes. But is it fun? That's still open for debate.

Runebound is a great entertainment after a day full of work. Maybe the theme is a little bit childish. But it all fits together and works just great. I can see that doing the same thing over and over again could get tiring and boring in some time, but than - you can have one of the expansions, besides it all depends on your own creativity and imagination - the game is really very flexible. 

As an adventure game, I like Arkham Horror theme much more.

RATING: N/A
This is a long game with some fiddly rules and sometimes limited flavor.  Gameplay is more complex than Talisman, and the characters feel less differentiated in their special abilities.  However, the game cards are sometimes pretty involved, and there's a movement system on top of the game.

I guess this isn't the type of game for me these days, especially with the length involved.

This is an example of a game that has the potential to be quite interesting but simply has too much downtime to be enjoyable with a large number of players.  I realize that player vs. player combat is possible but most turns are played basically solitaire.  I have played with 6 and with 3.  With three players the game probably rates as a 6.5 with six players it is a 3 for me.

I had to trade this away to a home where it will be loved and played thouroughly I hope. It's a good game and I'll buy it back whenever my game group (and me) is ready to play it and ejoy it. I need to find an exlusively AT group... It's simmilarity to games like Arkham Horror, the hundred of cards in english and the lack of interest from them and honestly from me, the dicefest, and the whole "fantasy experience" ultimately made it hit the shelf (maybe with the possibility of staying there forever)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely more fun with fewer people... our first game was with 5 or 6 players and the longish turns (esp combat) combined with lack of interaction led to people getting distracted, napping, etc. Followed by a game with 3 that was far better, but still the lack of interaction is a serious problem for me... hopefully a future expansion will fix that.

I love Arkham Horror but this game just doesnt work for me.  Too much downtime perhaps?  I just feel like the game is really designed to be a solitaire games as there is next to no player interaction

RATING: 6
I'm none too impressed. Theme isn't very good, the flavor text is even poorer, and the whole game can be summarized by "find the nearest respawn point of your chosen color, fight until you die or wish to move to the next higher color, lather rinse repeat". Is there a point hiding somewhere? the end game does get a little bit exciting when a race develops, but dear god, it take over 2 hours to get there! in that, this game is the most similar to Monopoly I know.

Great AT adventure game and a brilliant counterpart to Descent.  Plays pretty fast and random, but there are definitely good decision points and choices that makes smart players win more often.  Most impressively is how fast it sets up and how fast it takes down.  A go-to solo game as well.

One of the games I bought a few years back, before I really got into boardgaming, I remember playing it once back then and forgetting about it - it seemed too long and not particularly interesting. I played it two or three times last year and my opinion hasn't really changed - it's a mediocre game that gives a good sense of adventure in a fantasy setting, but not much more. It's possible I'll want to play it some time in the future but for now it's sitting in the cupboard.

Very much multi player solitaire so far. Also the downtime seems to cause other players to disengage.

I however like it. On your turn you have lots of decisions. At the start though with few items there are less but then can be rather too many choices later. 

Then you get ko'd with a bad roll which solves the item issue!

Played once.  

Good theme, artwork, and mechanics.  Excellent dice movement mechanic, although a set of movement dice for each player is recommended.  Ugly amount of downtown, even with smaller player counts.  Enjoyed it, but it really requires expansions to support replayability, and it massively overstays its welcome.  Long game with little payoff.  Mage Knight completely supplants this, just as the one-day (imagined) reprint of Magic Realm will supplant Mage Knight.

Not interested in playing again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

The first time we played this, we made the mistake of getting ambitious after winning one or two fights. Somehow we ran out of easy targets for levelling up, and we ended up aborting the game after a couple of hours with no end in sight. As an adventure game, this seems reasonably good. There's a well implemented story, and there's plenty of expansion content available to keep things fresh. I'd prefer to play something a little more cooperative or adversarial (such as Arkham Horror, or Middle Earth Quest) but if you're after something soloable that's easy to learn (or teach), this is worth checking out.

Great game for 1-2 players, really bogs down after 3+.  This game can take a while, expect about two hours per player.  I love the feeling this game gives you of going around building a stronger and stronger character like an MMO, but I don't care much for the theme or the board.  

During the mid to late game, you start wasting turns just walking across the map because it starts to become empty of things to do.  It starts to feel like the board is completely unnecessary.  

This is why Talisman is superior, because the map becomes more interesting, not less, over the course of the game.  Still a very fun game though and it gets played often because of the "zero to hero" feel the game gives you.

[1-6] A nice and good looking fantasy adventure game. Downtime is a huge problem with my friends if played with more than 4. The problem is, that they don't care what the others are doing and play it just for the exp and loot (damn WoW players :P).

My pick for the new "Talisman."  I am hopeful that the character expansion packs will increase player interaction and blow this game wide open.

Meanwhile, its mutual solitaire with a lot of luck of the draw, unbalanced characters which you have limited ability to compensate for, and a lengthy time commitment when you can be playing something else!

Is you like RPGs you will like Runebound. You get a good sense of adventure. Most of that comes from the great card artwork. The rules are simple, and the great rulebook makes the game is easy to learn. The game is customizable and a lot of special rules and variants exist.Expansion should expand on and already good game. Downtime with 2 player is minimal. lasts about 2-3 hours( plus 1h for each additional player). Although good, I was expecting more in the actual map quality. (The map looks pixalized). And I would add maybe more choice in character customization.

The game takes a little too long a 3 and more players. 
I Recommend playing with these variant:

1. The games starts too slow: To fix this, players could start with a lot more gold (maybe 5 ) or start with a 1 gold item or ally.

2. Encounters are rare, especially near the end game: todo play with random encounter variant

3. For shorter play: each level should take 3 experience.

4.Choice at the market is too limiting: Fix is to draw 2 cards at the market step and choose one to put in the market.

To test:
AutoHeal when gaining level? To speed up game play early on.

Find A less dangerous KO rule. Instead of lossing gold and highest item, the player looses one turn?

"The dark lords are gathering, ancient powers are awakening, and a chill has fallen across the land. It is a time of danger and rising evil. It is a time of fear for the weak and powerless. It is a time of heroes willing to face the darkness and bring the light of hope to a realm covered in shadow.
The world of Runebound is a magical, dangerous world of powerful wizards, noble knights, vicious monsters, and power-mad tyrants. It is a world of great quests and mighty deeds. Above all, it is a world of legendary heroes, and the time has come for you to join them"

RATING: 6
Just too long! Really only good as a solo game. But it does have an "epic RPG" type feel. Cool components to be sure. I have to agree with those who believe the story and world to be a little bland. 

But as I said: good for solitaire if you have several hours.

EDIT: I seem to like this game less and less the more I play. It's just dull, and doesn't feel at all "adventurous". It's weird because the game seems like it SHOULD be good. I just can't enjoy it that much. It's okay solo, but still drags on a long time.

Maybe with fewer players this would have been fun.  But it was multi-player solitaire for 4 hours (and I left with the game barely halfway done).  Maybe we were playing it wrong, but even after all that time, we were barely fighting level 2 enemies, since dying was so disastrous, no one wanted to take any risks on the bigger monsters.  So, it was really repetitive.

I feel like I shouldn't like this game as much as I do. It's slow and if you play it with other players, you rarely interact with them.

But it has a lot of charm, scratches that high-fantasy and character leveling itch, and it is just plain fun. I love all the items, allies, monsters, heroes. The components are top notch, combat can be fun/challenging, you can play solo and it is highly expandable. 

There is just too much here to enjoy that it manages to overcome any complaints I mentioned. Not to mention, it is strangely addicting. But as with most games, it is not for everyone.

RATING: 7
Nice adventure game, but tends to be repetitive after few plays. Addition of new cards is needed, but they may destroy the balance of game (especially ratio of monsters/events), additional game modes needed at long run. Takes large amounts of time and is not very rewarding, too random to be strategic, too repetitive to be adventurous. Non simultanous manner of play is baaad (ie 5 people, you play 3 minutes, you wait and watch 12 minutes, you *are* bored, people!).

Decided to try it out after years of fence-sitting.  The art is one area I would change.  Rating pending.

After two plays I am not terribly interested in playing again.  The random huge swings take my interest in the game away.  Will eventually play it again.  It is clearly a 'better' Talisman, but just like Talisman - for the time you don't get enough choices.

My kids play it together and I get to not play.  I doubt I would ever voluntarily play this again.

I had a really good time playing this game. I even enjoyed the length (though in playing with three people the downtime is much less)because there was always something to do. However, with too many players the game becomes exponentially bad, and I did not like the endgame when using the doomcounter option.

Edit: After some more plays it becomes readily apparent that the game is the players. Also, 4 players really should be the max that this game is played with. Rating of 7 remains though.

Theres a basis for a good game here and i whip it out every now and then hoping that maybe its actually better than i think. Perhaps if it was produced by someone with a more thorough approach to game design than FFG id be more impressed.

RATING: 8
Some things I really liked, others not so much (downtime!). The theme just seemed really unengaged to anything I was doing and it didn't feel like there was any narrative thread for me to follow. The card art is great, on par with Magic, but I didn't really feel like it had any connection to what I was doing.

Combat seemed a mixed bag, I liked the attempt to provide interesting tactical decisions, yet found that combat generally dragged far longer than it should have.

All that being said, the more I play it, the more I'm loving it. I am also a mega sucker for fantasy/RPG tropes and adventure games so while I don't think it's the best in it's class, I still am happy to have it and play it regularly.

Playing with two (or maybe three) is the way to go for sure. With two it's a great time, with 4+ it is just way too much downtime.

One of the few proper adventure games out there - actually feels like you're adventuring, rather than shuffling through a dungeon, whacking monsters. That said, it's a lot of rolling dice and seeing what comes out and didn't last in my collection. I do sorta miss it though, maybe Mage Knight would scratch the itch?

Update: Mage Knight filled the gap :) Runebound 3rd Edition is out sometime soon.

Great game to pass the day playing with my 7yo.

Based on a solo play and a 2-player game, I like what I've seen.  Neat mechanics for movement and combat, and while I could see a game dragging on a really long time, the theme and color text on the cards make things fun (and the numerous expansions seems like it will keep things fresh for quite awhile).  Seems to me to scratch a similar itch as Talisman, but with more interesting "exploration" going on.  Looking forward to getting this on the table again, and trying out some of the adventure deck expansions.

This game is a must have.  If you are old school and have played games like Talisman or Dark Tower then you will be thrilled with this game.  Basically take elements of a RPG, questing, gathering treasure, improving your character and roll them up in to a board game.  I highly recommend playing with most of the (recommended) optional rules and maybe making a few house rules to fit your style of play.  Runebound is PVP enabled, but I have only felt the need to use it once, and the many times I have played we have only had one clear cut winner, which is good.  Like I said this is a must have game if you are into fantasy adventure, you will not regret it.  And they just released a bunch of new content that you can pick up in expansion packs.

Its long, its complicated, its beautiful. Its the game for baby boomer former D&D players who just don't have the time to role-play anymore. Get your expandable fix here! While I slightly prefer Return of Heroes; this is still a great game. Expansions may add to more replayability and value. This one plays a little slower than RoH and with too many players can be agonizing. Still worth it for a fantasy role playing sort IMO.

RATING: 8
Fun little game.  A bit more complex than Talisman, and a bit less luck-driven than Talisman (which I like), although there is still quite a bit of luck.

I originally played without any doom \ threat\ timer of any sort.  I found that the game took way too long and it lacked tension.  We got way too powerful and easily beat the final challenges.

I put the game aside for about a year and recently got back into it again.  This time I tried the doom \ threat track and I found the game much better, and a lot more exciting!

I highly recommend playing with either doom or threat track variant.  I also recommend buying a few of the small card expansions to give the game more variety, otherwise you'll soon get bored with the core set.  Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to find most of the card expansions these days, at least for reasonable prices.

If you like Talisman, and light RPG games, I highly recommend this game.  It is fun, and pretty simple.

Generally, I don't like character-building battle games, as I feel the strategy is way too straightforward and the luck of the dice comes into play more often than not.  While Runebound definitely suffers from those characteristics, I still find myself enjoying it.  It's not the greatest game in the world and doesn't really distinguish itself from other battle games, but I feel like there's enough world exploration and entertaining gameplay to keep me satisfied for the length of the game.  It definitely suffers from a lack of catch-up mechanics (especially in the two-player game), as an early battle loss can prevent you from catching up to your unbeaten opponents.  The entertainment value will probably fade pretty quickly for me, but for now, I enjoy this game.

Really on the fence on this one--I like the "open world" aspect of this, which was definitely missing from Talisman, the only game I can relate it to experience-wise.  What is missing is that each character travels ALONE, and there is no reason (speaking rules-wise) to assist another player at all.  You are only playing to be a spectator for others, it you think about it that way.  I think I would like it more if you could ally up, rather than compete, against "the greatest evil the land has e'er known."  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a good group game.  Probably best for solo or two-players only, due to downtime between turns.  The game mostly plays itself, and you're along for the long ride.  Thick and rich, but low on actual nutrition.

Length is too long for me right now. Wish I had more time for the 3 hour committment! I obtained it to play solo, and have yet to do so. I traded Power Grid for this, and am regretting the trade a little. 

EDIT: UPDATE: WOO HOO! I just won this in a cool contest here on BGG. I'm so excited to play this solo now! After giving it away for Power Grid, a game I have only played once in three years, I've regretted never getting to play the solo game. I am truly excited to give this another try, especially after how much fun I've been having with Mage Knight solo.

EDIT2: I PLAYED THIS OVER A DOZEN TIMES, HALF SOLO, AND HAD FUN WITH IT. With 3rd edition coming out, it was time to sell it.

RATING: 2
Much too long for what it is - you have similar battles, over and over and over. For me, it ended up feeling like an MMO, grinding for levels.

The system looks like it could have potential. But this basic set just lacks. You have a nice map - but it doesn't matter, everywhere is the same. I kind of expect some sort of magic or special places on a fantasy map. The characters are uninspired, possibly because fitting them onto a card the same size as all the others seemed to have priority over making them interesting. Character development is meh, your stats go up, yea... The story line... isn't. There's signs of what could be there in the form of event and encounter cards that are mixed into the encounter decks, but they are too few IMO. There were a couple of encounters that, story-line-wise, involved actually helping out someone by travelling to some place on the map, and they were a very nice break from the 98% of them that were no more than "kill this monster".

Maybe the expansion games are better developed.

This game has a problem which stems from the fact that it is neither 'with' nor really 'versus'. Essentially this is a racing game where other take no interest in you except when you change pace (take on higher encounters). Then they have to either take up the same level of encounter or be left behind.
So essentially this might have made a good solo game, but as multi player game this is a total waste.

A good addition to the Fantasy Game Genre but requires lots of tweaks to keep it from growing long and dull. I like it best with 2 people and wouldn't really play with 3 or 4.  It works solo which is ok.  Epic, grand adventures, not really a 'play to win' type of game but an experience.  Wonderful expansions.  Lots of options/cards to tailor the game to your liking and lots of good variants posted around here to help you streamline play.  The threat track is a must to keep the game fresh.  I like to play with 3 market stacks (1-4; 5-9; 10+; use a 1d3 to determine a stack for a random draw)and 3 starting cards in each market (blind) with a market draw from the players choice of stacks (depending on what they can afford).  In addition to that I like the starting equipment variant and the three points to advance variant.  Those are just a couple of things you can do to really help speed the game along and keep the playing time reasonable. Lastly, this should really be played as a co-op game, playing this game competitively feels like a real expense of time.  

Ultimately, I prefer Citadel of Blood, DeathMaze, Prophecy, Return of the Heroes, or Magic Realm.

Expansions all sold.
Base game sold.

About as good as the first edition, although the miniatures are a nice addition. I am giving this a higher rating than the 1st ed. that I previously owned, because 1) I know what to expect; 2) I am now more into relatively shorter games that aren't the brain-burners of the heavy wargames--I just don't have the time or inclination to invest many afternoons on one game; 3) I love dungeon crawls, but D & D is too much of an investment (maybe I could use the map and movement of Runebound and have modified D & D style encounters...

As others have stated, when the box tells you 2 or 3 hours of gameplay they are clearly high.  It took three of us about an hour to figure out the ins and outs of the game, then play moved right along without a hitch.  6 hours later we were finally done, and that was playing with greater experience point rewards (as is suggested for "shorter" games in the rulebook).

My wife really enjoys this, but I simply wasn't taken the way I've been with some of the newer (though based on older) Fantasy Flight games, such as Arkham Horror and Fury of Dracula.  Come to think of it, I would have much rather been playing a good ol' game of Talisman.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating after first play. Surprised Martin Wallace is the designer of this... seems... less complex than his other stuff. Reminded me of Arkham Horror, only the players are allegedly competing. I say allegedly because in the two player game we played, there was no reason whatsoever for us to interact or compete with each other - it was more of a parallel race to victory.  Still I had a good time and wouldn't say no to another game.

Ratings lowered after second game. It felt mostly like the same experienced re-hashed, and I was disappointed. Not so much what I had hoped for and it looks like the only way to unlock replayability is to pony up for expansions--something I gave up on when I quit collecting ccgs.

A definite improvement over the 1st edition, which I already enjoyed.  Certainly not for everyone, but for the right group of players I think it can't be beaten.  If you have role-playing buddies that are interested in a night of "role-playing light," then this is the game for them.  Or if you're an old campaigner that hasn't role-played in a while, and you want to get your fix, this might do the trick.  It'll never replace a true pen-and-paper RPG, but it scratches an itch.

This game is pretty good, the only drawback in my eyes is that it can get a bit boring if you are playing with many players.

I've really enjoyed this game for a long time. Be willing to invest some time in browsing on forums etc. Plays best with two or 4 in teams of 2. Else too much downtime. PVP doesn't work well. 
I should give the basic game only a 7 because I did have to think of and apply a lot of house rules, but with all the expansions I bought and the house rules I applied I could give it an 8.

We are still working on the timing (as we have not finished a game and tend to be too conservative). The doom track apparently helps greatly with this. I think it will be fun in a small group as well as the large group that we have played it in.

Its an epic, if you like the idea of leveling up a character collecting loot wandering the wilds this game is for you. I also picked up 2 of the item/shop pack expansions which has given the shop stack around 120 cards so you never seen the same items in 1 game.

Also there is little interaction with other players, its more of a race to be the winner kind of game. I supose you could call it talisman super advanced
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a cracker of a Fantasy Adventure Game. Sure it is all about leveling up, acquiring the right item combos and the like but it is balanced so well with its 4 levels of adventure decks that help the action scale along with you.

As a multi-player it can really drag so I wouldn't recommend playing more than the occasional game with 3+ but with 2 it is great.

Where it really shines though is in the solo play (using Mr. Skeletor's solo variant - see BGG forums for details) that it offers. I can crank these at in about 90 minutes each and they remind me of plying Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks as a kid.

The only warning here is that you will see the cards in the Adventure decks within 5-7 plays so a regular supply of Deck Expansions is a must to mix up the action.

The big box expansions also throw new elements into the mix. 

I'm loving this game and am so glad I found it.

Несмотря на полную случайность всего, очевидный выбор направления передвижения, мне игра очень понравилась. Я слишком долго искал атмосферную бродилку, и эта явно лучше тех, что играл ранее (Prophecy, WoW:AG, Anima:SoO). Я готов мирится с отсутствием взаимодействия ради ощущения приключений и прокачки героя, которая действительно влияет на игру. Боёвка очень интересна. Вот только от системы передвижения я ожидал большего: вместо того, чтобы кубики определяли направление, они просто показывают попёрло или не попёрло тебе добраться до уже назначенной цели.

Helaas is er nauwelijks interactie tussen de spelers. Het is iedereen voor zich. Dit schijnt oplosbaar met bepaalde expansions.

RATING: 7
Falls short of its promise and is only really saved by the Threat Track rules floating around the 'Geek.  Not played with more than 2-3 players but imagine it would be horribly slow.  Works great solo but can be kind of abrupt in multiplayer.  The expansions are plentiful and this belongs in the collection of any real fantasy gamer.  Even though it's not perfect, it's a good contender for the overland questing fantasy adventure crown.  At the moment.  Someone get out there and design something else, quick!

RATING: 8.25
Runebound is a RPG-lite that let you quench that thirst for killing monsters in a fantasy setting. The expansions add a lot of variety and replayability and are worth buying. A word of caution: never play this game with more than three players.

With Sands of Al-Kalim and several small expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good. Runebound is the closest experience to RPG Dungeons and Dragon inside a Board Game box.  The game plays almost as a solitary game with two players, even if you enjoy how the other player defeats his enemies. The interaction is almost null within the game, and if you star adding more players to the game, you will suffer a penalty of game time... yep, almost 4 hours a two player game... with more, you can reach 8 or even more hours as I've been told.
The doom counter rules are mandatory to put a clock on the game.

Nice Dungeons and Dragons for two players though.

2007/03/01: One of the biggest issue about this game, is that when a player takes the lead, it's very hard to catch for the remaining players (I've only played this game with two other players).

2007/11/11: The leading player issue is solved with character decks.

I REALLY wanted to like this game.  Unfortunately, a recent 3-player session (my first time playing) confirmed my fears of it being a multi-player solitaire game with everyone playing independent of one another.  I just don't enjoy games in which people can leave the room when it's not their turn, come back, and not miss anything important.

This is a great game - lots of expansions available (big boards or just cards) which can really spice up the flavor of the game.  Pretty casual overall feel and is easily accessible to just about anyone.  Highly recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I gave the first edition a 4 and this edition a 6.  As a competitive PvP game, I'd still rate this as a 4.  However, I play the second edition as a co-op game with my two daughters.  Basically, we play it as a sort of co-op, Fantasy version of "The Game of Life."  I sort the cards so that the different markets vaguely specialize in different products, and naturally we start with 4 items visible in each market from the get go.  Green and Yellow encounters are taken on solo, and then Blue and Red encounters are taken on as a team.  Throw in the Doom Track for a little bit of pressure, and the game is a decent RPG in board format.  Even with the Doom Track, though, the game still lacks pacing somehow,...honestly I think that "The Game of Life" has better pacing, but if I have to play it again I'll go nuts.  Too, we've never played a co-op all the way through, but it's a fun night every once in a while, and it scratches my fantasy game itch.  I even have this vague idea that one could create a cool story-oriented RPG experience by adding Descent for dungeons, assigning the deck expansions carefully (i.e., when story flavor warranted), and maybe use the "Sands of Kalim" as a neighboring desert (i.e., essentially have the boards side-by-side).  It'd be expensive, though, and require a lot of rule tweaking.

Update: Sands of Al-Kalim brought me back to this game, and it's really grown on me.  Works best, imo as a solitaire adventure game.  Bumped rating to 7

Update: Bumped rating to an 8 based not on the initial game, but on Runebound as a system.  Through the various expansions the system has continued to work quite well, and reaches a sort of apogee, I think, with Mists.  I haven't encountered any other game system that absorbs expansions so well.  Would rate higher, but I just don't think that the game plays that well beyond solo play.

I am a pretty solid FFG fanboi--however this is medicore at best.  The downtime between players is a killer and random events that could easily give someone a 10 gold item for free during the early game is just too much.  Plus 3-4 hours for this game AND we play pretty fast.  The main thing that kills me is each player is playing their own game.  Player interaction is so low and you don't really care what happens to others on their turn.  WoW: TBG plays very similar.  I guess this could be good to bring out once a year but overall there are far too many better games that scratch this itch:  Descent, Doom, The last night on earth etc.  There is a huge item deck that i think i pulled from twice.  Yes, I only had 2 or 3 items (including allies) the whole game.  Events are fun with good flavor and SLOW build up of your characters powers is somewhat fun.  We played 3 XP per level.  I won't be buying this or playing it often but every once in awhile, maybe.

Interesting, but I think I would have preferred a wider variety of quests/encounters over the numerous combats. The expansions also add many good ideas, but the whole might have worked better if those ideas had been present at the beginning. I do like that it seems simple to play solo, though with a minor tweak from the base rules.

Mainly, it takes too long to play, is too long, and has a bit too little interaction. Like Talisman with more interesting rules but the same fundamental issues.

I bought this game when I knew nothing about hobby games. My DnD group played it often we had a blast. After I got into the hobby I played Runebound and realized wait I have played this games dozens of times and never finished it. It hit me, this is not a good game. I now hide it from my DnD group and suggest, pathfinder the card game or the Drizzt game, much better.

MUCH much improved over the First Edition.  It is impossible to overstate how important just the change to 2d10 from 1d20 is to the game.  Which isn't to say the rest of the changes aren't worthy also.

So much potential here, but it doesn't really do it for me. I really like the way you explore the map and level up, it really feels like an epic adventure.
But Epic also means looo-ooong. This game takes forever to play. 2-3 players at most. And they need to know what they are doing...
Every time we've played, there's been a reversed runaway leader problem. There's alway someone who starts with a few unlucky dice rolls and then never catches up. Not fun.
Also, the endgame can be a bit... anti-climatic...

RATING: 4
I was all set to hate this game when I first sat down to play it. Boy was I wrong.

Update: The Doom Track Variant shortens the length of the game by about 2 hours. However, it does leave a cheated feeling, like the game ended prematurely. I would not recommend the variant. Just set aside some time for the full game.

Update update: Nope. Can't say I like this game. It just takes too long, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so repetitive...

Update update update: Ok, bad joke. Anyway, long games are fine if they don't DRAG. Unfortunately, this one does.

Played a lot of this game solo before having kids, and loved the time spent with it. Used to be a personal "10", but rating has cooled slightly since it hasn't gotten off the shelf enough recently.

I wish there was a better sense of narrative created - either by giving challenges a tighter sense of context or adding some form of progressive individual quests. Still a solid game system despite a few limitations.

I have a lot of fun with this. It a great fantasy adventure game and the movement dice make for interesting situations.

A fantasy role playing board game.  Akin to Talisman, although a bit more strategic and decision-making.  Talisman you roll, move, and pick up a card.  Runebound you have a plethora of decisions to make.  What town/item/challenge should I move towards.

I hate the movement works.  I wish they could have come up with something better.  That is my one huge gripe with this game, the dice for movement.  I feel like I am trying to solve a puzzle every turn to try and make it where I need to be.

The game also tends to move very slowly.  Next time I play I will make sure to use the many different options here on the geek that people suggest to shorten up this beast.

Ooh, never again with more than 3 people. I don't mind downtime if I have anything to do (at least think about my next turn) or the actions of the active player are of any interest to me. Neither is the case in Runebound. 
Long time since I liked a game that needs so many house rules and/or variants. If you get knocked out with some gold, you will run after the leaders throughout the whole game, no chance to come back into the game, once the leader(s) have 1 good weapon and 1 good ally. Playing with variants that let the loser keep his valuables are necessary, otherwise they will be bored to death.

Wifey thought it was "okay" - that's probably because she was winning when we ended.

Runebound is fun with the right people. It might as well be a player-elimination type game, as a bad loss mid-way through the game can force a player to spend the rest of the game catching up while knowing he never will.

I enjoy this game as a solo game, or maybe for a couple of people really wanting a fantasy fix. But, what frustrates me is that everyone basically plays by themselves even if you have multiple players. The lack of player interaction is a draw-back in my opinion. OK for a rainy afternoon on your own, but I can't imagine playing this with a group.

I don't think I'll ever love this game, but I can't seem to let go of it. It's a sort of DM-less D&D Lite with somewhat unpredictable movement on a map. While a few little quests and global events are worked into the base game, it's mainly just fight the monster, win treasure and experience, acquire cool artifacts, level up, and eventually face off against the boss monster. Essentially it's a race game. So if you don't have another player to race against, you need to set a time limit and race against the clock (that's what Mr. Skeletor's threat-track solo rules do).

A good game to play occasionally, but it's simply too long and repetetive for any more than that. The movement dice are clever, but combat is fiddly and there's too much downtime. I'd rather play Talisman. EDIT- actually Runebound is the better game- it's more balanced. 

I'd definately rather play Runebound. I have decided that Talisman is far too random in terms of combat and random event cards for my tastes.

This game bored me. Zero interaction, precious little motivation to actually read the cards, very little decision making, no investment in the characters' development over time. Multiplayer solitaire.

The Midnight expansion was a really, really strong iteration of this game, and brought this up to an 8.5. I think that fixed a lot about what I did not like about Runebound. I once owned this and all the other Runebound expansions, hoping one of them would eventually make the game for me, but they never did. Not going to bother ranking all the expansions, just wanted to clarify that Runebound + Midnight = worthy.

There's no doubt it's too samey and repetitive for a long stretch of time, gradually increasing your dollars to buy better stuff to beat bigger enemies to get more dollars to buy better stuff to beat bigger enemies to get ... and so on. It's a largely non-interactive race game, adding abilities to keep up with the Joneses so that the dice will continue to be in your favour. Despite these flaws, as a two-player game to play with a teenage son, it hits a spot - turns come quickly, lots of dice rolling, a themed adventure, which turns out to be a nice way to spend a weekend afternoon.

This is neat relaxing fun. This light-medium long-playing solitaire-ish fantasy sandbox game is, at it's core, a race to fight the final boss(es) to win. Decent solo as well. However, this game is too long for what it is, and though I don't mind that, others will.

Quality components, including paintable miniatures. Much replayability through it's many heroes, combinations of allies and items, various encounters and events, and a whole mess of available expansions.

It took nearly a full game before we got all the rules right. Still, the learning game was so much fun that we played it again with the Shorter Runebound variant. Be ye warned that the rules need a few readings, and I suggest looking at the FAQ sheets at the FFG website.

Totally enraptured by this game right now. I was put off by a few of the reviews, but got a great deal on the base set, Frozen wastes, and 3 small deck expansions.

Great solo,and I cannot wait to introduce this to my group.

Don't believe the "roll,grind,roll" crowd. This game is fun and has a lot of replay value.

Quite ellegant mechanic but repetitive. You need to buy expantions to keep it fresh. I simply don`t buy this idea.

Edit. I bought it once again for solo playing. Much better experience than multiplayer game. So my rating is 9 (solo). As a 2 players game it is 8, as a 3 players game it is 7, and etc.

Using the Doom track really push players along in the game.  Essential for solo, too. **I'd forgotten how good the solo play is on this

What this game lacks in depth it makes up for in speed.  The endless line of expansions keep it fresh--too bad gameplay doesn't do that already.  I wish FFG would make just one Fantasy game where you get to raise an army or at least a band (not just 1-2 "allies"), so you'll have more on-map decision making in front of you.  Doom, Descent and Runebound are all 1-figure per player games...what, we aren't smart enough to run 4-8 figures each?!

Runebound was part of an ongoing quest to find a Talisman substitute. I play and enjoy Magic Realm but I want to have a lighter version of MR in my stable to appeal to more of my friends. For this purpose, Runebound is unsuitable. It takes a long time to play with many players for what it is and out games never had a lot of player conflict and interaction. This was alleviated somewhat with the character decks but added to the play time. Again, not a bad game at all but one that didn't meet the requirements I needed of a game of it's ilk.

RATING: 10
Picked up the game recently after doing a bunch of research on various games that would be fun for solo or two players and I couldn't be happier with my choice.

By itself I'd rate the game an 8 or a 9 but the addition of so many expansions and ability to tweak the rules easily gives it the full 10.

I really enjoy the artwork, flavor text, and components as I do feel transported to a different land and like I'm going on an epic quest fraught with tension and peril. There's a lot of food to feed my imagination with the game and its a definite plus.

Setting it all up isn't too bad, especially if you organize all your bits and pieces. Once you're familiar with where all the adventure tokens go (which took all of one play) setting it up probably only takes a couple of minutes. Where everything goes is easy to figure out and there's enough room to fit everything comfortably on the board.

I've played the game solo at least a dozen times and while I admit that the base adventure does get kind of boring, I've been playing at least two hour stretches every day since I got it so take that with a grain of salt. 

Even just adding a small box expansion (in this case Avatars of Kelnov) somehow managed to change the feel of the game world entirely and with so many adventure variants to choose from its not difficult at all to fix this small issue.

I should also mention I've played exclusively with Mr Skeletor's threat track variant for solo play and its worked out wonderfully and I heartily recommend everyone who hasn't tried it, to at least check it out as having a variable timer is a great way to play.

I enjoy the movement dice system and playing with another player really heightens the tension. The first time I played with my friend I ended up winning quite literally because of ONE movement die and it was absolutely thrilling. That being said, it always sucks when you roll next to nothing useful, but I've found that if its happening to me, its also happening to the other player so it balances out. All in all I feel it adds to the game more than it detracts as I enjoy the tension it creates when you've suddenly got to really think about where you're going and how you're going to get there, lest you waste too much time.

I've read a lot of complaints about downtime between turns but its not been an issue thus far playing with two people. I can't say anything for or against with more players, but I can say the game is a phenomenal amount of fun with two people.

The only time the game got bogged down was in the very last turns of a Frozen Wastes expansion game where I had just found the princess and my friend had to try and slay me to prevent me from winning and we had to make sense of the PvP rules which honestly, aren't all THAT bad to figure out. It just took a few minutes of reading and re-reading the section. The other problem was there was no way for him to feasibly defeat me given how both our characters were built, but that wasn't the fault of the rules so much as circumstance.

PvP rules aside, everything runs smooth and makes sense and there's plenty of room for adaptation and tweaking so if you're looking for a race style of game play dressed up in an atmospheric and enjoyable fantasy setting then Runebound should fit the bill nicely. If you want a game you can play by yourself and have a blast then absolutely look no further.

Definitely not the most originell, ballanced and thought out game, but always a tremendous amount of fun to play. - At least if you like a fantasy-based 'RPG'-boardgame involving a lot of dice-rolling and luck. 
But 120 min playtime is a very optimistic assumption.
Sweet spot for this game is three players; more than four lead to a considerable downtime.

RATING: 6
This is a pretty typical adventure game in which you run around encountering random stuff, gaining stats and equipment.  I liked the game's movement mechanic, which determined which terrains you could cross instead of how far you could move, but became increasingly limited as your character was injured.  However, we ran into a problem where the "easy" encounters ran out, and adventurers were left repeatedly getting smacked around by the next level of encounters.  Probably too long for what it is.

RATING: 7
Runebound also works fine as a single player game. I modified the 'Doom Track' rule for a single player; +1 card before a new Doom counter comes into play. This means that you add a new doom counter on the board every third card. That gives the game a better length. The regular Doom Track rules make the solo play way too short; you can only have nine cards at the doom track. There's no fun to the solitaire game this way because there really is too little time to develop your charachter.

Travel Hazard rules are also somewhat mandatory in solitary play. Withtout you're just running around the board without penalties for stopping on fields with no adventure counters on it. Travel hazard adds more tension.

Some encounter and adventure cards are useless in a solo game. (i.e. 'Give this card to another player, he then...'). 

A solo play expansion could be nice!

Pros:
+A lot of characters to choose from
+Nice artwork for [i]most[/i] of the cards.
+Fun theme
+Great random flavor text on cards
+Lots of pieces to play with
+Everything is made really well including the cards (VERY thick cardboard).
+Great solo player mode
+Can and should be house-ruled. I think the variants bring this game to life instead of the drab normal rules.

Cons:
-Get's repetitive after a while.
-Does not scale well.
-Zero interaction between players. It's literally multiplayer solitaire.
-Not a ton of variety.
-Can be too long for it's own good.
-Combat seemed a bit too easy.

Another fantasy luck fest. Some items are too overpowered as well, but I actually like this better than most other games in the genre like Descent. There's little in the way of meaningful decisions but it's not bad for an occasional game if you want something light and RPG-like. It's a lot less fiddly than most similar games, and we rarely needed to consult the rulebook unlike most games that are like this.

This game is the closest thing to Talisman that I have found (my thanks to all the lists and advice from other BGG'ers).  And it lends itself to solo play, which is a nice bonus.  Currently this is my favorite game in my (meager) collection.  I higly recommend it!

Very nice adventure game. The consecutive character build up with skill upgrades, items and allies is really enjoyable. The encounters, events and challenges tell a story pretty well: the earlier adventures tell more of a threatening story about what is going to happen soon and later in the game the things get pretty grim. I like how some of the beaten monsters offer thematic rewards to use in further adventures. The battle system is really interesting and offers interesting choices with three different attack types and using the help of allies.

There are some things that could be improved about the game, but nothing too bad. The interaction is also on the low side, but it didn´t bother me for this kind of game. Probably plays best with 2-3 players.

RATING: 7
Base game is disappointing. Perhaps someday someone will really manage to do this type of game just right.

A fun game with expansions. I would never play the game without some adventure variant or big box expansion.

Enjoyable when I'm in the mood for it. It's really best solo or with two or three people. Never play with more than three though.

If you get this get it with either the Mists of Zanaga expansion or Sands of Alkalim. Then add in a number of small box expansions. It makes the game much better.

I do believe the number of plays in this game, even with expansions, is quite limited. It's certainly fun while it lasts, but I think it will wear out it's welcome in my collection quickly. I've seen others with the same sentiments as well. I'm sure I would always play it a couple of times a year, but that's a really low frequency for me. 

edit: with a possible 3rd edition on the way I decided to sell this one.

I'm quite a fan of fantasy adventures where you can explore many areas, have varying encounters and have the option of carrying unlimited combinations of equipment. I have only played one single-player game of Runebound 2nd ed, but it satisfied my every need.
Game wouldn't be as good if I didn't know that there are many expansion and further possibilities to have different kinds of gaming experiences.

Looking forward to trying this with more players and have some competition on board!

Update: The basic game feels too much an unbalanced racing game! I think a lot of house rules are needed. Until then, lowered the rating to 7.
Expansions might fix this problem - I keep trying. And btw, I won't rate those mini-expansions separately unless they are very distinctive (e.g. adventure variants).

Edit2: 7->6 and sold the game. Too race-like game to be fun...

1st solo play. Interesting game. A lot of stuff that I haven't seen yet. Many ways to develop your character. Promises good. An alternative to computer games.
2nd solo play. Totally different game, which is nice. A lot of different ways to develop your hero indeed. But still need to buy more adventure packs since after 2 games I have already seen them all. Also more market cards would be nice. Also need to make the game a bit harder somehow...

This is a great solo game. Takes about 2,5 hours the way I play it. I rate it a 10 for solo play.

I now have all all the extra market decks I have found (5 of them) which makes every game very different.

Also the big expansion change the game radically. Also the small Adventure decks are great.

Great fantasy adventure that plays well with two.  Despite seeing some of the same monsters from one game to the next, it still manages to feel like a new challenge each time.  The wealth of options in small expansions keep things fresh.  The movement system is delightfully AP-inducing.  The only downside is that it requires a 3-4 hours to play, so it can't be squeezed in quite as often as we'd like.  With 3-players, the downtime between turns starts to be more palpable, but it's still not too bad.

Not a bad game, but not a great one. Some of my group really enjoys it, while others find that it's too luck-based, overly long, and has too much downtime, especially with 4 or more players.

Good turn system and built in clock, the movement dice system is cool, and the combat is straightforward and relatively quick.

I own the second edition that came with the miniatures and revised rules.. thank god for that.

This is a good game for me and my friends - reason?  We're not grognards and enjoy a fun time.  This game (as purchased) is not broken, and like many other titles I own, should be appreciated for what it is - an experience game.  I think people who are creatively-minded will enjoy this more than those who aren't, because it is very easy to do anything you want.  I'll bet some people complain about the game 'out of the box', but you know, what Runebound and FFG provide you with is a backdrop to a realm, and its up to the players to bring their energy and excitement to the table.  Dice, chits, cards galore.  Good quality, much fun, and I'm looking forward to playing with the expansion.

Update:  Docked the game .5, relegating it to '7' territory.  As an experience game - it's good.  But.. it will take about 4 hours to result in a win.  For someone. Gets "meh"-ish after the 3rd hour.

(note: the timing here is due to the fact that I don't play with a regular gaming group, a lot of socializing is involved, as well as a lot of beer)

OWN: 3rd EDITION

2nd EDITION COMMENTS...

Awesome RPG on a board. It does take a while to play, but the adventures you get to have along the way make it well worth your time!

Compared with Return of the Heroes, Runebound tends to take longer but is meatier (more complex abilities & items etc.) and much more varied, while at the same time having much less convoluted rules, and being easier to tweak to your liking if required. It also has some of the feel of Talisman, but with many more choices to make.

Plays well with 2 players, and it's faster that way too.

Great components. The box is extremely over-sized, though in this case it could actually be useful for storing the expansions...

The HUGE number and variety of available expansions can only help the replayability (and the base game is hardly lacking in that area to begin with). Definitely a game that we'll be playing well into the future!

Some of the expansions encourage PvP combat, but the system doesn't really lend itself well to beating up on other characters. The base game seems to play better as a friendlier affair, although there are occasions where an attack on another player can be a good move, particularly if they're already weakened from an earlier combat.

NOTE: Includes unpainted grey figures (for player-characters only). With games like this I've recently taken the approach of blu-tacking small coloured poker chips underneath the figures (with a matching chip on the table in front of each player). This helps differentiate the figures when you don't have the time or desire to paint numerous figures.

-The rules for this game are pretty vague in my opinion, it called for us to add some of our own rules for balancing. (Which I didn't mind so much, it made it costumizable.) 
-The movement system was different, but in a good way. 
-This game could use more interaction between players, (We added our own rules to make this happen.) other wise it's just a bunch of people playing by them selves at the same time. 
-I enjoyed the game, it was actually pretty fun to play, though it did last around 2-3 hours. It's nice if you want to kill an afternoon. Once you get the hang of the rules, it becomes enjoyable.
-I would like it if they re-did the fighting system a tad differently. Such as There is only need to defend and attack once per combat round.
-The final monsters became a bit too weak towards the end of the game. There has to be a level cap, and more exp needed to level up the higher you get.
-It would be nice if this game offered some lore as well, to make the role-playing aspect more doable.

All in all, this is a pretty decent game. It's fun and pretty customizable which I enjoyed. They could re-work a few things, but it's not that needed. If you see it on sale, or just for a price under 40 dollars, I 'd say buy it.

Great game of Fantasy. Good artwork (like the most games of Fantasy Flight) and great theme. Its a game very replayable with his multiple expansions, but with a playing lenght too long (correctable with the use of official alternative rule "Doom Track").

RATING: 7
Being a long-time roleplayer I always find enjoyment in the "travel about, kill stuff, level your character" style of fantasy board game. I think Runebound is the best of such games - Talisman being too random, Prophecy lacking replayability and Mage Knight being too complex for the knockabout fun this genre demands.

RATING: 8
very good base for a better game- Runebound is basically a primitive WoW The Board Game.  With more interesting combat (as opposed to "roll and compare numbers") and more player interaction and cooperation, this genre'll be perfected.

Lots of dice - check, plastic figurines - check, beautiful map - check, kicking the monsters butts and take their gold - check.  Well, it's a winner with me.  

I'm not always in the mood for a dice-rolling monster adventure quest, but Runebound is a good one.

I approached this game reluctantly but 
I was very surprised. At the beginning of
the game it is not so cool, you 've got to get
money so you can get stuff. But when you level 
up! Yep, after getting armor, weapons,... and 
after raising your stats - Time to kill some
big guys!
It is like Video game RPG, just on your table.
I like it.

'orrible, repetitive and little to no player interaction. It feels solved after the first play. I strongly warn against buying this game unless you're willing to shell out for its expansions. With all that money though, it's better to just grab all the expansions for Arkham Horror.

Can only be played solo or with 2 players. Anything beyond kills a piece of your soul.

Hi.
Played the game yesterday twice with my friends. Nice and fun.
During the game we had some fights arguing meaning of cards :)

Do some one knows:

1. All "melee weapon" cards have +1 or +2 wound. Does it means that the item inflicts damage only when attack was successful, or in any case of attack and deffence?

2. Does it possible "to buy" items for ally and "to level" him, to make him stronger?

3. We found that it is too easy to kill High Dragon Lord, much more than to kill simple Dragon Lord because there is no some special abilities and "before fight" traps. Are we missing something?

The game to go to for me.
Best game I can think of that has so many options for each turn. Yes there are restrictions in movement with the dice, but without those a lot of structure of the game would be lost.

RATING: 7
Pretty good game.  A lot of fun.  Minies are fantastic with the artwork to match.  Board and cards aren't as good as I'd like.  The box insert wasn't designed really well to hold all of the cards.  Despite this, a very good game.

RATING: 7.25
Players pit themselves against foes (allies if you like) to aquire gems.  Sets of gems help you acquire aditional skill levels.  Depending on the number of players determines the number of gems needed to increase a skill.  I would recommend using the optional soft rules when you die loose nothing.  It helps to move the game along.  Remember to use your character's special abilities. I really enjoyed playing this game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As good as the first edition, but is it better?  Second edition is more challenging than first edition, which is great.  Also, the characters are finally balanced.  Unfortunately, the rules still need tweaking.  Healing is ridiculously expensive.  Combine that with reduced rewards and increased damage from challenges, and the game can turn into a scrounge-fest for gold.  The death penalty is overly harsh as well...again stripping you of all your cash and forcing the game into one big quest for gold.  Fortunately, this game is very friendly to house rules, and I have no problem tweaking it to my needs...reducing the cost of healing and the death penalty for starters.

This was my attempt to get a decent "Talisman" type game. Has a lot to recommend it like great artwork and good theme and interesting and varied card decks. If you have the right people you will have a great game. Played with two very enjoyable. Can take awhile when played with more. I now play with slightly amended rules in order to speed the game up, principally splitting the market deck into 3 piles and using the xp level up as 1,2,3 etc.

RATING: 5
Really not my cup of tea at all.  Like the Warcraft game (whichever is the most recent; can't remember the name) and Talisman, the game seems to go on far, far too long, and consist of rolling lots of dice with *huge* swings of fortune.  I have no desire to - and will actively avoid - playing it again.

RATING: 8
Played once, and the game was cut a little short because of time. I DID get to face off against Margath, albeit well before I would have liked to. Nice gameplay though, with few complaints.

I think this is a game that I would love to set aside a Sunday and play once a month. I think the time limit will frighten most of my gaming groups away, so it probably will remain a wishlist item.

RATING: 7
The upside:
-Mighty fine rpg-boardgame experience with the obligatory player count(2-3 players).
-Plenty of items, quest and heroes to keep things fresh. Also lots of expansions available.
-Using dice for movement keeps me from loathing them, since it manages to provide some decisions in where to send your hero with what you're given.

The downside:
-Downtime issues.

RATING: 5
Nice sized board, not overly large.  Quality bits, and not an overwhelming many of them in this FFG offering.  Played with the Character decks and the "Menace" mechaninc, though I see we got the acquisition of Menace a little bit wrong.  It still made other player's turns more exciting.  Not too wild about the basic game, as the game dragged for three hours, only picking up excitement for the last half hour. With the mistake we made about Menace, the game likely should have taken a great deal longer.  Better than Descent was.

Runebound suits my cravings for an RPG fix, but my tastes spoilt somewhat by the quality and pace of computer-RPGs, I find the game a tad tedious. It's still an enjoyable game, so long as players don't drag the game on longer than necessary.

RATING: N/A
I actually feel a bit let down by this one, it really looked good but actually the map or the means of moving around on it aren't that engaging. It sort of feels quite repetitive with the only saving grace being the event and the missions in th encounter deck to make things feel slighty progressive.
The theme is quite cod as well at least Talisman as the old Teutonic fantasy background, Runebounds theme feels a bit lame.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
We played it just once. While it's a bit more complicated than, say, Talisman, it felt very dull and repetitive. Move, draw encounter card, fight (doing the same steps over and over again), advance to next "level". In Talisman, monsters are just a fraction of the events deck and you never know what you're going to run across. In Runebound, even if you draw something else, you still need to draw again just to complete the mandatory challenge card. It feels forced and not fun at all.

I'm not rating it because we didn't even finish the first game, but it's not something I would recommend to anyone - well, maybe to kids who love fantasy theme, although in my opinion Talisman delivers more laugh and with all the expansions, additional boards and stuff is just a superior adventure game in the "light thematic" category.

I like this game, and it can be really fun, but there is a lot of down time in multiplayer games.  It's pretty much like playing a game by yourself but you have to wait for other people to take their turns.  It's not readily obvious, but this is actually a race game where the fastest player to get high level and good items is probably going to win.  This game is a pretty solid 6.

Great solo play, good multi player and quite satisfying with some variants (May I suggest the threat track and Cities of Adventure variants?) One of my favorites.

Essentially a solitaire race game. Great with 2 players, but the downtime gets significantly worse with each additional player added. Won't play with more than 3 again.

I have played this one a lot of times. Me and my playgroup realy like it and with the different little card-expansions the replayability is growing significantly. I have only one complain: why isn't there in the box any pre-made character sheet??? The quality of FFGs are tremendous, but the lack of character-sheets makes me angry!!
Edit #1: The sweat-spot for this game is 3player, don't recommend this with more. Also the quality of the small-expansions is quite low.

I rate this game a 5 out of the box for 3 players.  It would be a point higher for 2 player or solitaire and a point lower for 4 players.  (It is unplayably slow with 5 or 6 players despite what the box says.)

The main problem with the game is the long play time and MANY people have suggested various house rules to speed the game up.  With a few simple house rules the game is much more fun.  Add 2 to the rating.

I've written a full review of the game which includes the house rules we like.

If you are going to enjoy this game do not play slow and cautious.  You are in a race, push the envelope and go after the tougher monsters quickly.  This both speeds the game and makes it more exciting. 

FFG fixes a number of problems in this costly game in an expensive big box expansion.  (Like what they have done in TI3 and Game of Thrones board game.)  If you want to encourage such a publisher strategy, then buy this game and the $60 expansions.

Runs way too long, otherwise it's a fine RPGish boardgame. Also, it could have more interaction between players. I like it play it with as few as 2 players, so there won't be much downtime. The charater decks are a real cool add-on although they make the game last a bit longer.

So far, we've only had the initial play.  But we had a blast.  Realized that it probably wasn't wise to start the game at 7:00 at night.  Game went until 1:30 am.  It was a little shaky at first, but once we did a few rounds, it was very easy.  Learned some new rules along the way, made up some house rules.  

We look forward to our next game and also future expansions (I know, but it's new to me).

The story bites on the cards match a good theme and make it feel like you have a DM controlling the game.  being a DM myself, I read all the cards to help give it that feel.

Played a few times when it first came out and it sat on my shelf for years.  Finally pulled it out again and have been playing a single game with my son and wife for over a month - we squeeze in a turn or two after dinner before bed.

It's great for what it is.  The movement dice are a really interesting mechanic and the production is second to none.

For me, fighting the bad guys really feels same-y after about 3 battles.  BUT this is great with my 6-year-old son as he grasps what his guy is good at and where the bad guys are weak.

Great game to play with my 6 year-old son.

This is a fun adventure game for two. Also, played solo but that's not much different than with other because there is little interaction between players.  Played solo with Doom track variant which speeds the game up a bit but seems a little broken.  Thus, I tried the skeletor solo rules which seems to be quite enjoyable and reasonable.  the pet peeve of this game is that not all characters appear to be balanced which can be frustrating especially for new players.  Wouldn't recommend over two maybe three players because of the lengthy downtime.

While combat is simplistic and movement overly complicated (but fun!), the fighting and getting stronger really reminds me of what I love in computer RPGs. This game builds stories.

[b]Traded away May 2012[/b]

I enjoyed this game solo using Mr. Skeletor's threat track rules as well as with 2 players using some modified co-op type rules for a while. 

[b]What I like[/b]:
:d10-1: It has a strong RPG flavor. I liked the character building even though it was limited to three character traits.
:d10-2: I appreciate the art on the cards and the flavor and theme the cards impart on the game.
:d10-3: The combat mechanism is cool. Resolve distance, magic and then melee attacks. Because of this, each character approaches combat differently and has strengths and weaknesses that others don't.
:d10-4: Each character has special abilities that further differentiate them.

[b]What I don't like[/b]:
:d10-1: The tension in the multiplayer game doesn't match the theme. For a theme where heroes are trying to stop an evil force trying to dominate the land, Runebound is really a race against other hero players, and not a competition against the bad guys. The bad guys in this game don't apply any pressure against the good guys. They are just there to provide the players something to compete over. In my perfect world, this would have been a cooperative game and the players would be working together to defeat the enemy who would apply pressure and possibly defeat the players.
:d10-2: My main reason for purchasing this game was to have a solitaire RPG game which would immerse me in theme and provide a challenging game, as all great solitaire titles do. I think there are some good variants out there that approach this, but they ultimately didn't quite cut it for me. I also see potential for personally developing a homemade variant to suit my needs. However, it seemed like too much work when there are other games out there that are enjoyable without a lot of work from me. 
:d10-3: No tension, whether multiplayer or solitaire. I need tension, and what this game provides does not suffice.

[b]The Main Point[/b]
Ultimately I think FFG missed the boat with this one by not developing Runebound as a cooperative with the enemy able to exert a competitive game against the players. I guess I'm really looking for an Arkham Horror type game in a standard fantasy setting. I found more or less what I'm looking for in Defenders of the Realm, although Runebound has some elements I like that aren't in DotR. I can definitely understand this game working for some players, especially those with the right group. But it just didn't work for me as a solitaire or multiplayer game.

Solo Player Value = Fair.  A good game, but better with more players.  More players adds the element of speed and necessity to the game.

Two Player Value = Good. A fun game that will get played more.

Three Player Value = Good. A fun game that will get played more. 


Runebound is an adventure game where players take on the role of heroes who stomp across the land to fulfill a pre-subsrcibed task of killing the bad guy. To help them on their travels the players can hire allies and obtain powerful weapons, armor and items. Characters also level and get more powerful as they fight against the baddies.

That is basically the same plot and mechanic of every role-playing video game ever made. So I find it helpful to think of Runebound as a board game version of a RPG video game. Same concept minus the controller.

Overall Runebound is a fun game to play and it handles the role-playing aspect very well. You feel like you are in a role-playing game.

The board/map is large and filled with many adventure sites. Plenty enough to keep to players busy. There are also many cities the players can visit to acquire good and companions.

Movement of the characters across the board/map is handled by a well designed dice mechanic. Players will need to learn how to take advantage of proper movement to make their character go where they want.

Encounters are clearly marked on the board/map and are labeled with a level of difficultly, or experience level, so players know which encounters best suit their character. This very helpful when leveling your character so you know which encounters offer more experience. This is again very helpful for the end game so you know which encounters to go after to find the bad guy.

The actual encounter is handled through a deck of cards that represent that level of difficultly or experience. Draw the top and play along.

Leveling your hero is very simple. Each encounter gives experience in the form of currency equal to the experience level. Players use that currency to purchase upgrades for the heroes that will help them in a specific way; like better melee fighting or more hit points.

Buying items and allies is equally easy. Characters can visit cities and purchase any available items with the money they loot from killing monsters.

Combat uses an interesting 2d10 system. This offers the player better odds when rolling for hitting and killing enemies than using a single d20. Modifying the roll is simply stacking all the bonuses from weapons and items.

The components are all very good. The board/map contains a lot of information yet remains clean and easy to read. The hexes on the map have nice artwork and look a lot the real environment. The cards are made from a heavy stock and have well done art as well.

When we start talking about strategy is where Runebound takes a few knocks because there is not much here. Roll, move, fight. Repeat. It feels almost puzzle like. In fact, it feels just like an RPG video game. Run around looking for things to kill so you can level enough to kill the boss.

Runebound also offers players a different strategy aspect with the ability to attack each other. I never enjoyed this much as it does nothing to progress to the game. Nor does it offer experience for your character. I prefer to play the game as a multi-player solitaire.

Two suggested variants are helpful to use. One is a timing mechanic to bring on the end game quicker to prevent players from stalling. The other is used to make traveling more adventurous and adds in random encounters when moving. I enjoy and use both.

I usually do not like mentioning expansions while discussing the base game, but I will make an exception in this case. The game handles expansions extremely well. Many expansions exists for Runebound and they come in two types: Big box and small box. Big box expansions offer new maps and whole new adventures. Small box expansions only change the existing game slightly. I prefer small box expansions. I believe it better to alter the base game just slightly, to tweak it a little, as opposed to changing it entirely.


Pros - 
- True RPG video game feel 
- Easy to learn and play 


Cons -
- Not must strategy
- The expansions are hard to find and very costly

As mentioned in the full write-up of the game, Runebound handles expansions fantastically.  The expansions fit beautifully into the game.

Also mentioned above were the different types of expansions: Big Box and Small Box.

I do not like the big box expansions. I feel they alter the base game too greatly. The big box expansions offer a new board/map with a whole new adventure. Big box expansions also give you new characters for the new adventure. Plus new weapons, armors, items and allies. Basically, it is an entirely new game. Not much of an expansion really.  It could be a new stand alone game except it requires the components from the base game.

I prefer the small box expansions. These expansions only change the base game slightly. They change or add-to the base in some small detail. 

Additionally, small box expansions come in several different types. Each type of small box expansion changes or adds to the game in a certain way. The different types of small box expansions are:
- [i]Item & Allies[/i] - Gives the players more powerful items
- [i]Challenge[/i] - Adds to the adventure cards stacks to bring new challenges in encounters
- [i]Adventure[/i] - Changes the base adventure to a whole new adventure while using the same base game 
- [i]Character[/i] - Gives new characters to use

Of the four types of small box expansions I only use two kinds: Challenge and Adventure. They offer the biggest change to the game while still keeping the base game intact.

I will go over each small box expansion briefly below while breaking them into their types.


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]

Item & Allies expansions are simply more items and extra allies that are added to the deck.

Many of the added items and allies are extremely powerful.

A few of these are a lot of fun to play with, however I do not use any of them.


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Character expansions add new abilities to the characters.

Each expansions add a new class that can be added to the character that provide new and powerful abilities.  Each has new cards to power the added abilities.

Some of these are fun to play with, but I don't use any of them.


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Challenge expansions add cards to the adventures decks to make the encounters more difficult or to add a new twist in the game.

These types of expansions can be used in conjunction with other types of expansions. You can even use multiple challenge expansions together. But I prefer not to.

At most I enjoy the addition a single challenge expansions and a single Adventure expansion.

The Challenge expansions I have are - 



[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Adventure expansions alter the end game condition.  These take out the existing end bad guy and replace it with completely new win conditions.

I really enjoy types of expansions because they bring a new feeling to the game yet retain the basics.

I do enjoy use a single adventure explains in conjunction with a single challenge expansion.

The adventure expansions that I have are -

Very fun game, but moves a bit slowly, worse with more players. I solve this by cutting back the amount of experience required to level up. That way, the game progresses at a slightly faster rate.

Very little player interaction, few meaningful decisions, a drawn out endgame, and, in my one playing, suffered from a significant run away leader problem.

Update 9/25/11: We played with the 1/2/3/4/5/etc xp/level variant.  While it certainly accelerated the early game, I still felt like we were each playing our own solitaire game.

This is a favorite among my gaming group.  It does have a touch of multi-player solitaire, but we all enjoy watching everyone else race to fight the badguy at the endgame.  It's rewarding to level your hero, and gradually become more powerful.  It's extremely gratifying to take out reds, when you know that they are so strong.  This game is really fun.  It can get a bit long, so I recommend using the variant for faster level gains by decreasing the experience needed by one.  The doom track variant forces players to act too quickly, which causes players to die too much and actually makes it less enjoyable for everyone, IMHO.  Again, great game.

El mejor juego de aventuras, salvo MR, pero este es bastante más sencillo de jugar y de duración. Ofrece un montón de posibilidades de elección y un control bastante decente sobre la gestión del personaje.
Excelentemente ambientado y con un azar "controlable", si no te gusta algo lo modificas pues es muy fácil adaptar cualquier regla que se te ocurra.
Lo peor del juego es que las partidas se pueden alargar mucho, los tiempos muertos enormes ( nunca más de 3 jugadores) y te puedes quedar descolgado con respecto a los otros jugadores.

Pros: Super fun dice rolling fantasy race/adventure game. I loved leveling up my hero over the course of the game, recruiting allies and equipping armor. My thirst for AT has been quenched with this one. It's a lot of fun.

Cons: The artwork on the board is dreadful and makes the towns very difficult to see.
The playtime is MUCH too long. So much so that it might mean the game goes out the door sooner than later, unfortunately. I really liked it, but four hours is unacceptable in a game this light.

This has quickly become a favourite and plays quite well with 2 players.  It's a good mix of activities from buying/selling and exploring, and questing.  The movement mechanic does mean you will not always be able to go where you want, putting constraints on your strategy.  The game does drag on a times, especially if you are not willing to take risk and push the story/events.

RATING: 7
Runebound is quite fun.  I very rarely solo game, but Runebound is excellent for that using Mr. Skeletor's threat track rules.  I scratches the fantasy gaming itch.  

I also play this with my 2 boys, who love it.  The challenge with Runebound for me is that it takes a long time to play.  That is not so much a problem playing solo with threat track rules.  But when playing with the kids it can take a while.  We use modified characters that start the game supercharged in abilities and each starts with one random item and ally, each a cost of 6 or under.  We also allow healing of 2 hearts for 1 gold.  Using these tweaks, we take a 6 hour game and get it down to 90 to 120 mins.  For an extra short game, we play what we call Dragon Hunt.  Under that variant the first player to succeed against a red threat wins.   Anyway, we enjoy the game and the kids have fun creating new characters (we developed a set of character development rules as well) with special abilities and the like.  Runebound does not scale as easily as, say, Prophecy.  Prophecy is very easily scaled and for that reason better for us.  But we still enjoy RB a lot and I expect we will be getting some of the big board and other expansions over the years.  

EDIT:  With more experience, our games are shorter and we are using the base characters who start with a few enhancements and a cheap ally and item.  We play different end game scenarios depending on how much time we have.  Sometime we play to one red kill, sometimes the normal scenario end, and sometimes we just have a real world time limit and use a self-made score system.  It is all very enjoyable.  My initial rating for this was about a 6.5, it later moved up to an 8.  It was at a 9 for awhile but is back down to an 8.

I have to admit I had more fun than I expected to.  My GF and I bought this so she could relive her college D&D days with a minimum of fuss, and it satisfied that requirement as best as could be expected.  The game can run a little long, and may lead to some frustration, but we took a break in the middle and I think that helped.  Still, sometimes blowing one roll is all it takes to knock your character out for a few turns.  Overall, it's a pretty good specimen of the recent Talisman-derived fantasy oeuvre.

RATING: 9
Played solo using threat track variant. Probably took 6 hours to finish. Might play with 2 players, definitely not with more. Would prefer if the game were cooperative. Movement dice can be a nuisance when you're trying to get somewhere and they won't let you. Most of the time its okay but, near the end, most Red challenges are in forest; if you don't roll a forest, you need to wait another turn and keep trying till you do (which, technically, might never happen). Definitely worth investing in things that aid movement (the Teleport rune, for instance, is excellent). Each time you defeat a Red challenge it becomes easier to defeat the next, not sure that's a good thing. The map is not especially interesting. It would be better if the towns had more differentiation/specialization, to encourage you to visit them for specific reasons. Will try "Cities of Adventure" fan-made variant to see if that helps. Also need to play with the adventure variant next time, so traveling becomes more interesting. Can see this becoming stale without expansions. Consider getting the desert and ice expansions....

RATING: 7
There are many valid complaints one might have about this game. There's the multiplayer solitaire factor. There's the lack of meaningful decisions to make. There's the samey nature of gameplay - you hardly ever do anything else than fight monsters and go to town to heal and buy items. The storyline is a (possibly intentional) turkey, and I hardly ever felt immersed into it.

Those are all qualities of a bad game. Yet somehow, in the end, it's not so bad. In fact, it's very addictive - for some reason that I can't put my finger on, I keep wanting to play this thing over and over again.

You're going to need to buy expansions if you intend to play this game more than once or twice. Otherwise, you'll just be fighting the same old monsters every game you play. No need to go overboard though, even if it's tempting because they're so cheap - two or three challenge decks make a lot of difference.

A aventura é bacana. O jogo roda legal. Demora umas quatro horas. Muitos combates. Faltou o movimento passar uma maior sensação de aventura.

Bastante subvalorizado por aqui já que é uma excelente aventura, equilibrada, várias boas expansões. Demora um pouco demais, mas é essencialmente solo ou para dois jogadores, o que flexibiliza a distribuição do tempo.

I purchased this specifically for solitaire play, and I've squeezed many many hours of solid entertainment from it.  My first half-dozen plays or so were very fun, but now that I've seen most of what the base game (and some of the expansions) has to offer, I've lost a lot of interest. The combat system is elegant, and there's definitely a sense of satisfaction that comes from building up your hero and collecting powerful items. However, ultimately the game just comes down to a rather dull move-attack-heal pattern with little strategic consideration.  It desperately needs a quest system.

Once I added the "Sands" big-box expansion, the fundamental weaknesses of the base game really stood out.  With Sands, it is a MUCH stronger game (see my review of Sands for more details) but Sands has limited replayability due to lack of expansions.  I wish Runebound was more than it is because in many ways, this is the game I dreamt about when i was a 10 year old boy.

Generally speaking, just found this very boring. There could have been weapons or armour involved, or something more to spice up the mechanics. Not only that but there is the potential to not win the game at all. If you play with too many players then no one can get enough runes and with only a few red markers, its possible for the dragon lord to be at the bottom of the red deck and never make it to the top b/c the red tokens don't regenerate.

Of the RPG Board Games this one has the best combat system.  Also notable is that there are several different challenge decks of increasing difficulty.  This is a big improvement over Talisman and Prophecy where having only 1 adventure deck results in some odd draws - too tough creatures early in the game or too easy creatures in the late game.

The problem is with even 4 people playing this game, the time you are actually playing is too infrequent for me to justify pulling this out more often than not. I feel like I sit, and sit, and sit waiting for my turn, only to take a 2 minute turn and then I'm back to waiting. For a group that is more efficient than mine this group may be great, but for a casual group of people who chat, drink, and then take their turn, this game is a pass.

This game seemed like it took forever! It had some fun to it but most of the game it feels like your waiting for someone else's turn to be over. We played with four people but I think it would be best with 3.

I bought this looking for a successor to Talisman.  It is a small step up in the "Fantasy Adventure" genre.  I find that the ranged characters can get a big lead early in the game.  Plus, it is difficult to catch the leader, especially if you die early on (a problem for magic types).

We have probably spent more time as a family (not the wife :( ) playing this game (with variants) than any other.  It does run a little long, but using some tricks keeps the downtime minimized.  

Leveling up and overland adventure is just fantastic.  No game does that better.  It isn't super-strategic, but it does require you to push your luck and take some risks.  And excellent, well-developed theme throughout!

My kids (7 and 10) love it.  If it was an hour we would play it more, but then it wouldn't be as epic and your character wouldn't grow, so i think it is the perfect length as is.

Definitely not recommended with more than 3 total players, and 2 is better in many ways.

There is nothing monumental going on here, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do.  I liked the system in the original edition, but the minor tweaks make the second edition a better game.  It is pretty straight forward stuff, you run around and beat stuff up, you level up and repeat.  I find these kinds of games relaxing, others may find them mind numbing and boring.  I'd only play this with 1-3 players any more and the downtime would kill the enjoyment for me.

I'm a sucker for any game that emulates in any way a roleplaying experience. Be it a dungeon crawl or a quest/adventure game. Runebound is the type of game I've wanted to design myself for years. It certainly isn't perfect but it does so many things right in my opinion that I would never turn down an offer to play it. I can see why some people wouldn't like it, but much like it's brother (Descent: Journeys in the Dark) it's exactly my type of game. I appreciate all the things they changed in the 2nd edition. I only wish they'd made it this way in the first place...

Our first game was way too long and a bit too random, but this improved on subsequent plays. I found the movement dice annoying. However, it is fun and thematically interesting enough to make me a repeat player. Having played both editions, I find most of the changes in Second Edition for the better, except that the multiples on the experince upgrade tokens were removed. I don't understand why 2nd Edition deserves a separate entry on BGG, but I have corrected my notes to account for this. I have revised this rating down after playing Descent because I enjoyed Descent more. Runebound is just odd in that it gives the feeling of a cooperative game, but it's not.

By my fourth play, I've found it to be boring multiplayer solitaire and lowered my rating again.

Well, well -- I bought this for the solo aspect and haven't been disappointed one bit.  If I need to have an evening to unwind and wrap myself in a story through gaming, this is the one that gets pulled off the shelf.  Several games are playable with solo play, but if you use the Threat Track, I feel that Runebound is in the Top 3 of what I have seen out there.  Some choice expansions make the game even better.  And of course, I'm a big fan of Terrinoth.

After several plays and attempts to improve the game through some small box expansions, I must admit that this game just doesn't do it for me.It seems like it has the makings of a decent game -  innovative combat, and you really get the feeling that you're playing and advancing a character - but somehow it ends up boring me to tears.

Excellent game.  Again, does not come out as often as I'd like due to length of play.  2nd ed. did "fix" what felt too easy to get through in the 1st ed.  But my group had tweaked the rules to make it almost what the 2nd ed. made it.

RATING: 8
Very good game.  My wife and i like that there isn't a lot of player confrontation.  The shear number of cards makes for a high replayability.  I'll still buy the expansions to keep it fresh.

One complaint is that it's easy for one player to leave the other in the dust in terms of items and levels.  Making the back half of the game one player simply waiting for the first player to win.

Still, we both like the rich theme so it makes it enjoyable.

A fun replacement for Talisman. Unless you attack other players, though, it's largely a multiplayer solitaire game. The movement system is interesting but a bit cumbersome: it takes a while to figure out where you [i]can[/i] go so it would be nice if they shipped the game with more dice. Play with the Doom Track - it's fiddly, but it sure does speed up the game.

More difficult than 1st ed. Play this with the idea that it is meant to be about having fun while going through the game, not just about winning or "beating" the game. The RPG aspect of the game is intentional and is as much a part of the game as is winning.
Every game is a new experience; even plays just as well solo IMO.
Easy to get the rules down, and being able to play a game of this size and length without ever having to hunt for a rule is a huge plus.

Boring for two or more, but an OK diversion if played solo.  There's not enough real strategy or skill, just a series of events and encounters that you roll dice to resolve.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this game a fair amount, but length kills it.  Even when using the shorter game variant, the games seem to drag on for four hours or so.  Playing it with the basic rules can take almost six.  The fact that people seem to think you can only play this game with two or three people severely limits its appeal to me because I help run a gaming club with 5-9 members on average, so a game that's supposed to support six but only really supports three just doesn't cut it.  Like RoboRally, I also feel like this suffers from dragging on to the point where most people just want to abandon it.

My opinion hasn't changed much, but I now have some of the expansions that go with the game.  Maybe those will help me form a firmer opinion on whether or not this behemoth of a game can be salvaged.  Not that it's bad or too long, since I play 18XX games, but it is too long for what it is.  That's never good.

I have a soft spot for fantasy adventure games, and this is one of my favourites. It's a bit on the long side, but if you keep the number of players limited to two or three and nobody dawdles, downtime should be minimal.

Runebound is a fantasy adventure game in the Talisman mold, and has similar strengths (large decks of cards providing variety) and weaknesses (takes too damned long to reach a conclusion.)

Really unfun rolling whammy where the leader gets stronger and wipes out all the easy pickins, leaving the other plays to flounder until the end.  The whole game which lasts at least an hour too long is one repetitive action after another.  It seems to try too hard to be a 'fantasy adventure,' and it's tough to convert an adventure into a boardgame partly because the flexibility of an RPG is absent.

RATING: 5
Generic fantasy game of heroes wandering about, fighting monsters and getting loot.

I vaguely recall reading that Martin Wallace came up with the core system for the game then handed it over to Fantasy Flight to flesh out, which doesn't surprise me. The movement mechanism in particular is unusual and interesting (if absurdly unthematic); the flavour text and everything else is as dull as can be.

I'm pretty sure that it's actually best as a solitaire game, since additional players add essentially no interaction, merely a great deal of downtime. It's basically a race to victory and the same tension can be achieved by playing the game on a timer using the doom track.

If the downtime and lack of interaction aren't a concern -- if you sanely choose to play it only solitaire, for example -- then it's a very solid entry in the "more story than strategy" genre. Mechanically it all works well and there's a real narrative progression in the strength of the monsters and the ability of the characters. My problem is mostly that, as with the rest of its genre, I can't see a reason for it to exist -- you're better off playing a real RPG for an immersive storytelling experience or a strategy game for some actual strategy.

I enjoy it more than my rating would suggest, but I can't see ever wanting to get it to the table. Sold my copy.

Game has fair theme play, it is generic and could be better.  Found the semi-random movement system (by dice) to be frustrating.  Player interaction is minimal.  Game lacks a 'catch up' mechanism.  Combat is quite involved, which leads to extremely painful amounts of downtime.  The components are of excellent quality.  Game length is long and drags for what this game has to offer.

RATING: 6.5
I was disappointed in Runebound; it sounded totally my speed.  But it ended up being a fairly bland "wander around and kill stuff for a few hours" experience.  Maybe with PvP the game would go better and be more interactive (I worry it would also take even longer, though maybe it would just help the strongest player win sooner), but as it was, it was clear who the winner was an hour before we finished.  Granted, we were playing with five people--I hear this is too many for the game to really be of a desirable length--but even that aside, I found the flavor to be lacking (distinguishing it from better "wander around and do stuff" games like Arkham), the mechanics to be nothing special (except for a kind of cool movement system), and it spent far too long in the middle stages of 2nd and 3rd level adventures before we were ready to take on the big bads at the end.

Runebound needed a few tweaks to first edition to be a great game; instead, it got a total overhaul to the system that makes into an incredibly long, drawn out, and fairly dull experience.  Cards to "increase interaction" mostly just add more complexity and even more downtime.  Quite a dissapointment.

RATING: 5
This started out fun, but just takes much too long for what it is. After a while you're just rolling dice, rolling some more dice, then rolling some more dice. Once behind it's difficult to catch up, which makes the game duration even more of a problem.

Besides that, I strongly dislike the dice-based movement system. It has several problems: it can be quite hard to figure out what to do with your roll, adding to the time you need to take your turn; and since you don't know what you're going to roll, it's hard to anticipate. Also, it's extremely frustrating to not get anywhere because of a bad roll.

In short - not my adventure board game. I'm still to find mine, incidentally.

Played 1+ times.  It's a very fun adventure game.  Both times I've played we've played with accelerated leveling and it still took a long time.  so... It's a long game. (4-5 hours)  Probably best with 2 or 3.  I really like the adventuring and buffing your character.  You really have to focus on getting good weapons that add damage though and you don't want to dilly dally around and let other people get them first. 2007/03/17

Whew! Just finished our first (2p) game.  This took 6 hours with making dinner, answering calls and helping the neighbor briefly. We will definitely be condensing the playtime next go round.  We enjoyed this except for certain points where we got stuck on yellow encounters.  I thankfully ended the game by crushing Margath in my third trip to the red zone.  The crazy part was it just took one excellent before combat card and an activated item to kill him.  We celebrated not the win, but the merciful end of the game.  This may sound like we did not like it but it will be hitting the table again. 

2nd play : 3 hours. Wife won with a kill of Margath.  She enjoys it, which is an uber bonus.

Movement in this game annoys me a lot, they added more complexity for no reason at all.

The whole fighting system is illogical beond belief. For example; you add red chits when for wounds, that's great as every other game on this planet use red chits to represent life.

And finally the characters, oh my good, they all have catch phrases...and the lamest ones you have ever heard at that...it just kills my suspension of disbelief.

This game is painfully long, with the potential to be the longest game I have ever played.  Seriously, this game could last for 12 hours.  Additionally, it is not very rewarding and it doesn't feel like you are accomplishing very much in that time.  Worse, there are some serious mechanics issues like when 2 people back stab each other constantly and one ends up res'ing next to the other player, killing them over and over.

Mage Knight completely puts this game to shame.  I don't know why I would ever waste my time with this game.  All this being said, the combat can be fun and the theme is alright.

Takes a high-level view of adventuring (ie short combats and more about optimizing your equips and expenditures).  I'd rather have something with more interesting combats like Descent.  Can drag on at times, even using house rules to speed things up.

I felt like the combat was too complex for what usually came down to one die roll.  Compare to Prophecy, where combat doesn't try to be more than a single die roll.

When played solo with the doom track, this isn't bad. Much like Arkham, when played solo, this is about the story as much as it is a game (I guess like playing an RPG computer game). This is probably why FFG has done so well with this and Arkham and the expansions. The expansions are like more chapters in a choose your own adventure series. Here's the thing - I think this is the better solo game of the two.

With more than one player, it becomes a multiplayer solitaire race game. Probably this should never be played with more than 3 players.

Runebound is the best Ameritrash adventure game I've played.  Mage Knight is better, but that's a totally different animal.  The WoW Adventure game is similar, but not nearly as good.

There are a ton of different heroes and they all play very differently.  I really like the leveling progression and how you can choose which stats to increase.  The items were fun and varied, the encounters were entertaining, and the combat system is unique but satisfying.  The movement system also provided some interesting puzzle solving and unpredictability.

The game can be very lucky/swingy, but that's not uncommon for the genre.  There can also be a lot of downtime because you have nothing to do on other people's turns, so I think the game is best with 2 players.  I would maybe try a 3 player game, but 4 would be way too long.  I haven't looked at the solo rules, but this would be a fun solo game.

This game has had a new lease on life as a 2 player game with my wife.  I don't think I would play it with more than 3 people just due to the lack of interaction and down time.

If not for the infuriating amount of cards you amass in the latter stages of the game and having to remember all their bonuses, this would be a solid 10 bordering on 11.

Everything you heard is true -- it's long, there's little player interaction, and the movement rules are wingnut (if thematic). Still, this game is so customizable, has a vast quantity of expansions, and so much replay that it's clearly the frontrunner of the RPG-adventure genre.

Actually a quite good fantasy "level-up game". This is not the genre I like, so the rating is a 6 only. It is not unnecessarily complicated and the play time can be well adjusted by the number of experience points you need to buy extra points for your character.

Runebound it somewhat like Talisman with a few differences. I think my wife likes this game more then i do, the only thing I don;t like about the game is the dice that came with mine. They have stickers on them and they are starting to come off with more and more use. I like the mechanics of the game and it is easy to learn. It is almost like a dungeon crew, but more adventure like.

Ah, I LOVED this game. So much my friends had to have an intervention. No joke.

This game has so much variation, from encounters, to characters, to leveling builds, to strategies, to item/ally drops. Just with the base set, you can play and replay it to a point of obscenity before it stops feeling fresh, and that's without even involving expansions. 

All that said, I mentioned an intervention? This is absolutely a "winning strategy" game... it involves a lot of adapting to the circumstances, but at any given time, there is probably one decision you can make over the others that is actively wiser and more likely to lead to success... and the player who has the most knowledge of the game will thus win more often than not. Eventually it got to a point where out of the couple dozen people I played with, I only had two friends who had a chance of beating me, and one who'd never won once and was stubbornly determined to beat me at least once... other than them, basically all the rest of my friends sat me down and told me I always win and that's no fun and they never wanted to play again.

So... buyer beware... depending on your skill level, you may become so profficient no one will play you, or alternately you may end up finding a friend/friends who you can never beat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This has to be the most well-designed game I've ever played.The game maintains a balance of skill and luck throughout every element of play. Every decision you make has a meaningful outcome on the situation and there is little chance for the cards to favor one player over another. Draw a tough monster? Get a higher reward for slaying it. Draw a nice item card? Pay extra for it. Everything given usually must be earned, but rarely punished.

one of my favourites... good theme, fun adventure game..  brings back to mind some of the RPG games I used to play on nintendo.

Now that I've had a chance to play the game a few more times, I feel like I've really gotten a feeling for it. It's a really good gaming system. It hearkens back to the good old days in my youth of playing fantasy boardgames.

It's well designed and flows quite well. In fact, it plays a lot faster than a lot of people give it credit for. A lot of the time, we would be ready for the next level of encounters before we thought we were.

By itself, a fairly basic, but well made fantasy game. The expansions offer a lot and I'm looking forward to rekindling that long lost giddy feeling from my youth.

WOW, as an avid player of all that is elder scrolls and rpg's both video/board game... THIS....GAME....RULES!!! easy to learn and soooo much fun, the game is great for solo players as well as up to (i'd say) 3 maybe 4 players. anymore theres alitte to much down time for my liking, BUT don't let that deter you. the game itself is well made, well planned, well thought out and well executed. the game feels like your traveling a fantasy realm engaging in epic battle with deadly necromancers, the evil they spawn and fearsome dragons. The game rules are EXTREMELY flexable, u can shorten and lengthen the game, make it easyer or harder, introduce traveling hazards, and even use house rules, for instance we dont use the PvP mechanic.overall,if you don't own this game... shoot yourself... then go buy it.

RATING: 5.5
First Impression:
Here's a game I never thought I'd like.

It's a fantasy adventure game, with heroes that roam the land slaughtering the "terryfying" but practically helpless mosters left and right gaining exp until someone manages to beat the boss and win the game. It's terribly simple and straightforward but that is a strong point in a fully thematic game. It's enjoyable and keeps players interested.

Despite my detest for fantasy themes and luck-full no-decisions ameritrash games, I'd rate this game even higher - that's how much I liked it. However, there is one serious, almost fatal flaw, that doubles the duration of the game, adds pointless downtime and tires the players for no reason: The movement mechanism. I'm speechless about it. Rolling dice for movement is terrible to begin with, but rolling dice and then trying to figure out where you can move is 10 times worse. I seriously encourage homeruling a simple point cost movement against this abomination (5 MPs to spend per turn + 1 for every henchman/object that helps movement by rerolling and roads/cities 1MP cost, plains/rivers 2MP cost, hills 3MP cost, woods/mountains/swamps 3MP cost or something like that). This simple rule will speed the game to a full gallop and allow the players to focus on the meat of the game - the adventuring.

Overall I expect my rating to drop the more I play this game as I expect to progressively get bored by it. As it is now however, I am eager to play it again, escpecially with the movement homeruled.

A strangely light (dare I say relaxing?) take on the RPG/Dungeon Crawl.  This is a great title which seems to almost play itself at times.  A really good game to burn some hours over without feeling stressed over the outcome.  A surefire hit with Swords and Sorcery geeks who don't have time for a full blown campaign.  The affordable expansions add meat for practically no cost.

I really like this game as a two player title, and would not play with more than 3.  Waaaay too much downtime with higher player count.

**EDIT, 5/16/2011**  Bumping my rating on Runebound to an 8.  This is simply a great game to kill an afternoon with.  The great variety of expansions, encounters, weapons and variants really keep it fresh.  It will never be a balanced Euro or beat my favoirte Arkham Horror, but it is a great little adventure game that simply wont quit.

RATING: 6.5
The mechanics are quite fun but repetitive. I haven't played with large groups so I don't know how it plays with lots of player interactions. With a 1-2p game it is kind of tedious, so you may want to house rule it a fair bit, find what works for you. Most of our house rules are focused on making it play faster, letting heroes level up quickly and accumulate lots of gear and allies so you can swoop in for the kill and take out Kaladra. Haven't played the 3rd edition, so can't compare the mechanics of the two and say which I prefer, but the movement dice were one of the unique differentiators in this one so it's a shame to see them gone.

Theme and variety of cards are excellent, the mechanics look right, but it's just too long and too much down-time between turns.  For me, Mage Knight does a better job of a longer explore and fight stuff game, and the D&D board games the same for a general "RPG-lite".

Wife and I both love this game.  Having a single hero battle monsters and traps and running around the board gaining experience and gaining allies and weapons, armor, runes, magic.  If you are starting out with board games and trying to find an 'epic' feel without the 3 hours of game play then give this one a try.  My wife loves fantasy and this game is nothing but.  The downside?  We find that we spend too much time on the easy experience gain (easy monsters) and when we have 3-4 experience counters we move onto the next level...meaning we take too long to play the game.

Don't believe the 120 minute playing time written on the box.  I've played several 2-players games that took 3-4 hours and many 4-player game that took 4-6 hours.  Even with that being said, it is a fun game if you have the time.

The time can be cut by lowering the amount of experience it takes for each bonus you get.  We also play that you only lose 1 item (player's choice) and 1/2 gold when knocked out.

I like the game for the experience it provides during play, not as much about the result. Although, I only bring it to the table to play solo or up to 3 players, as a single really bad roll (1 1) in a critical moment may ruin the game for a player and he ends up having to watch the others play while he struggles during the many hours till the game is finished.

There are two things that really breaks the fun in this game for me.

a) If you get behind in XP/Level, there is no catch up mechanic. So unless the leader gets some really bad luck, you might be playing for a long time knowing you've already lost.

b) The combat mechanic is completely broken in my opinion. Where ranged classes can possibly kill an enemy before getting attacked. Magic users risk being damaged twice, before they get to have a go at the enemy.

Besides that, the play time is really just much longer than it ought be.

This game seems to go on forever. I play it a lot actually - because my wife and I have found that it is a great game to have standing somewhere and do a couple of encounters once in a while. I do highly recommend making it easier to gain levels. The game has a suggestion for quicker play to reduce the needed experience points to 4 for 2 people. I prefer lowering it even further. Something I do like is that the game gets some "tradeable cardgame feel" as you try to figure out how to best combat an encounter. I have been very impressed by how, if you press on without waiting too much, each battle can seem very close and dangerous, yet you rarely end up dying -- which is a good gamemaster's job -- although there is no gamemaster here.

RATING: 6.5
Great game to play on a lazy Sunday, to relive the old school days of boardgaming. When you are in the mood for a bit of a luck fest and don't mind spending some time with a game, this is quite a good title with great quality components (love the artwork!). Personally, I like this and Return Of The Heroes about the same, albeit for different reasons. Both are better than the much overrated Talisman, although the second edition of that game remains charming for its artwork alone. Runebound looks better, has better written rules and more variety than ROTH. Return Of The Heroes, however, is faster with less text to read and less downtime between turns (mainly because it requires les micro management). But be warned: All games of this ilk seem to have very limited player interactivity. It is much easier to settle for Return Of The Heroes for a similar experience.
UPDATE: It has been a couple of years after my first play and I recently played it again with two players. I like the micro management of henchmen and equipment quite a lot. The looks are not as attractive as back then, though, because lately FFG and DOW have been turning out much better looking titles. The only drawback of this game is that it is very, very long. It took us 5 hours to finish it! I think it will not see the table more than maybe once a year because of that.

I like Runebound. It's fun. I'm just not sure about the fun level being high enough to compensate for the luck level and playing time. If I'm going to play a pseudo-RPG board game of this length, I might choose Arkham Horror instead.

RATING: 7
Runebound fills the light fantasy niche for me just about as well as I could hope. The rules are simple enough to explain in just a few minutes, the combat and movement systems provide enough choices to be interesting without provoking paralysis, and there's enough story in the cards to be entertaining. Like most games of this style, it can run a bit long, especially with more players - I don't think I'd want to play this with more than three. And there's certainly lots of luck involved - I wouldn't play this as a "serious" game in the same way that I would Magic Realm. But Runebound makes for a fine afternoon's entertainment when I'm in the right mood for it. It also solos extremely well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Good game as long as you don't play it too often as the gameplay is fairly repetitive.

It is also good for solo play with the same proviso. Great narrative and the expansions make for a welcome change.
Return of the Heroes is better for non-solo play though.

I really dislike the art work, specifically their sleazy depiction of female characters. They may be adolescent boy friendly but are not adult or family friendly.

Our first 2p game started off very poorly, playing out-of-the-box rules.  After some BoGGling, I added a "gaggle" of house rules/variants and we "finished" the game with a much more fun experience.  I say "finish" because nobody won... we both died witout any red cards when the doomtrack expired.  Although we really love Return of the Heroes, and Arkham Horror, RB is going to have a tough time ever seeing more gameplay, although I would be willing to give it a try.

I really love this!  The movement dice,the player customization, the treasure...very simple to understand and a ton of fun!  Can't wait to get more expansions!  I wish the boss battles would be tougher, but this game gives a very solid RPG-ish feel in a condensed format. Although the game plays pretty long if you have more than 2 players in my opinion.  Great for what it is...

Another in a crowded genre of kill enemies, get loot, level up, buy gear, etc.  This one's main distinguishing feature is the movement mechanics, and the streamlined combat system, supplemented by cards which add the special cases.  As far a light adventure romp, this is pretty good, although I like my fantasy games to have a bit more storytelling and theme.  Still, there's decisions here, and risk, and all kinds of good stuff to explore.  If you want [url=http://videogamegeek.com/videogame/68350/final-fantasy]Final Fantasy[/url] on a board, this is as close as you're going to get, replete with special items, enemies, and frequent trips to town.

After a couple of plays, the game seems to tell its story very well, but is overlong for its substance. Gonna try it with some suggested house rules to keep playtime down a little.

Fun game, I always play with variants though. If I played with the original rules without any modifications I think my rating would move down quite a bit. 

Update: I have played WOW:The Boardgame and WOW:The Adventure game and Arkham Horror of the 4 games I think Runebound is the best. I think it really shines with a few of the item expansions thrown in so there is more variety in the items.

Update:8/25/13 I am moving the score up from an 8 to an 8.5 I just love playing Runebound. Solo if fun but I enjoy 2 players probably the best. 4-6 players is fun but takes a long time.

The game as presented in the rules is LONG.  We managed to *not* finish it twice in frustration before we adopted an accelerated method for building up your characters levels.  This seemed to move the game along nicely and was just the ticket to take it from a disaster of a game for me, to a fun game I don't at all mind playing.  I like the movement dice mechanism, I have not seen movement resolved quite like that before.  Beyond that it is a fairly straight forward RPG style adventure game.  My rating reflects the method we play using our house rule allowing characters to level at a faster rate.

Traded. I thought this game would be a slam dunk for me. I love Arkham Horror and fantasy is more my cup of tea than horror but for some reason this fell flat. The solo rules seem to be too difficult even if I cheat a bit and the one time I played it with a friend it seemed to drag and there wasn't much fun to be had. I think I need to give it another try with a group that really gets into it. This gets a 7 (insteda of a 6) becasue of the solo play option.

Darrell Hardy & Martin Wallace; This plays well solo. In this game you take the role of a character which is one of several adventurers. You travel around over the world looking to find adventures which are presented on the board as dots. Once you land on a dot, you draw a card that tells you what monster (normally it's a monster that you fight, and that's the adventure) you battle, or on rare occasions, what events take place. Upon defeating the monster, or finishing the quick adventure, you gain experience dependant on how high a level the monster was. In the basic game without any expansions, you face one major world threat, which once you defeat it, or it defeats you, the game ends. Lots of expansions!

RATING: 6
It's Fantasy Flight, so not surprisingly the components are a highlight. High quality cards and lots of them, plastic miniatures for the heroes, countless heavy duty tokens and a nicely illustrated gameboard. The only downside is the dice, which comparatively speaking are pretty cheap. They are stickered, and in an odd design choice, illustrated with symbols lifted right out of a dungeons and dragons campaign map circa 1978. Luckily, I am just lame enough to recognize them, so it wasn't tremendously difficult for me to interpret them. Still, normal people may require a cheat sheet the first couple of times through.

At first glance, Runebound seems like a good light roleplaying game in the vein of Arkham Horror or Last Night on Earth. In truth, what Runebound delivers is multi-player solitaire. Player turns are completely non-interactive, to the point that a player with a second set of dice can take their turn simultaneously with the active player. While this certainly can speed things up, it detracts from the immersion that games of this nature require to be successful.

Another challenge to the game's atmosphere is that despite its outward appearance as a fantasy adventure game, Runebound is actually a race game...albeit a very slow one. The only impetus to act is the aggressiveness of the other players. If they all play too cautiously (and they often will, as character death is brutally punishing) the game can drag on endlessly. I have seen sessions which should have ended in two hours instead go almost three and a half because the leader didn't want to risk dying, especially when he had such a commanding lead. This sort of end game stalemate happens fairly often, allowing the game to fall into a rut if no one is willing to push it forward. It my experience, once a leader is established the competitive game is over. From that point forward, the game turns into a cooperative effort with everyone working together to help the leader win...just so they can get it over with already.

Mechanically, the game is solid, but certainly not ground breaking. It probably would have been better served as a straight co-op game with a strong group nemesis. As it sits, with nothing to really drive the game to conclusion and no real player interaction, it all just seems rather long and pointless.

Runebound is a good solitaire game. The Base game has stronger theme (compared with the expansions). The Event, Challenge and Encounter cards do very well telling the story!
Considering, you play with Mr. Skeletor's Solo rules, it works perfect solo! See here:

http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/49058/runebound-solo-rules

Also, for more story elements, I recommend to play with the Cities of Adventure expansion. Thus each town gets the unique backgroud and events happening during you visit the town. (But it makes the game longer).

[b]Pro[/b]:
1. Rules: Easy to learn and to play.

2. Very good fantasy adventure theme, which is well supported by the mechanics, abilities and card images.

3. Difficulty is good scalable, using the Threat Track   solo.

4. Nice card images and flavour text.

[b]Contra[/b]:
1. Usually my solo game takes 8-10 hours (with the Cities of Adventure expansion), because I am still playing at low Threat difficulty.
1.1 Improvements/House rules:
- I play the expansions with the Faster Experience Levelling variant rule from the Frozen Wastes Expansion rulebook, p. 14. 

2. Some item abilities feel at first a bit unthematic, but if you read the following thread, you might see this from an other point of view:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/579724/activation-question/new

3. The rules aren't written very well, so I often have to look up a specific rule in the FAQ. But the BGG rule forum helped me also quite a lot!

A medium-complex adventure/role-playing game. It adds good variety to a collection. The game is largely individualistic -- each player is on their own quest upgrading their characters. Thus, there could be big downtime as each player does their stuff. The game seems to work well with 3, but would be horrible with 5-6.

There is luck involved, since the battles are dice based and the items/monsters you encounter come from shuffled decks. It seems like a decent straightforward adventure game, and I'd have to play again to make a further assessment. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Well I bought this game together with Dungeon Twister. I read numerous articles here on BGG about adventure type games. My collection is heavenly euro/german orientated. So I wanted something different...

I've played Runebound 2nd Edition twice now, solo. And I liked it! The rules didn't have many problems for me. I found them very clear. The only questions I had were about combat situations and the activation of cards.

I found one typo in the rules; a hero can use his special before combat ability once, while on page 8 of the rules "Example of a challenge" it appears a hero can use it more often. As always this answer is covered here on BGG. Some other questions I had were all covered here on BGG too.

What did I like about this game:
- The game tells a story, if you can use you’re imagination, you're wandering the Runebound world.
- At first I had a dice rolling feeling, and I don't like dice... But soon I lost this feeling, for example using dice to move is (for me) something completely new, and feels innovative!
- You can't just jump around and pick up adventures and start beating your opponents. You have to upgrade your hero and use allies, weapons, armour etc. Which all can be bought at the market, the good ones cost hard earned gold! Loved that too; earn it hard and use it wise! Upgrading takes a while, but gives great satisfaction.
- So this game has a strategic touch; upgrade in the right way, choose your allies wise, pick the right items etc.
- In other words I felt myself get more involved and attached to my hero.
- The combat system is just great. Most games I've played that use dice for combat solutions didn't give a feeling of control. After playing for example "Struggle of Empires" I discovered that dice can be conquered. In Runebound it's the same; if you upgrade and use your hero and his abilities wise, if you choose the right allies etc. you’ll stand a change. That makes the combat very strategic, because it has enough 'layers' to choose from! It gives the game tension.
- This game got me involved on an emotional level; good games do this with me.

I won't rate the game yet. Must play it more often and keep the feeling I've described here above.

Conclusion; I bought the game with reservations, at first I was afraid that it would be a dice game without enough strategic options. Two games solo until now proved this feeling wrong. It has enough strategic options where you can control the dice.

After my third (solo or not to solo) game I'll come back. For the record; this is the first game that I've played twice solo and finished.

Okay, I've played this game a bunch now, and I love it.  The character variety, and adventures are plenty enough to make the game different every time.  The expansions (I have the Isle of Dread) add to the variety when you are wanting more.  In some ways, this game reminds me of Talisman, except that you never really get too powerful - keeping characters to one armor, two weapons and two allies is a good way of managing that.  Great game!

This game has grown on me.  As a two player game it isn't too bad.  I can imagine that as the number of players grow, it will probably start to drag.  I have found that you have to pay attention to the flavor text on the cards.  There is a story being told there.

I am interested in giving some expansions (small and big box) a try.

Theme? What theme? At most 30 minutes into the game, you don't talk about magic and such. You say you need to roll a 7.
Too long. Did i already mention it?

In fact, the gameplay feels a lot like Return of the Heroes, only it lasts 4 times as long, is much more complicated, and you have much more downtimes (since the single turns are much longer). And much more random, too.

One of my favorite games, despite it's flaws. Some of the heroes are poorly balanced and some of the Challenge cards and Market cards have vague rules, but I just don't care.
If you like theme in a game, this one has it by the truck load. It feels like you're a character in an epic story as you play. I have all the expansions as well and they add a tremendous amount of variety so that replay value is very high. You will never get the same combination of Market items, Challenges and Events twice! Another key reason I like it so well is because it plays great as a solo game.

A fantasy/adventure board game where a particular adventure is played. Each adventure determines the object of the quest, and what wonders and obstacles will be encountered along the way.
Players take turns navigating a board that displays the terrain of a fantasy world. Each turn allows a character to visit towns or friendly locations (where items and allies can be found), facing an encounter (which provide events and enemies), or interacting with another player by landing in the same space.

This is the solo and multi-adventure game i've been looking for. With Sands of Al Kalim gameplay improvements I actually prefer it to Talisman and even, dare I write, the new D&D games. I think it's the bright, old-skool card art and lush hills and mountains on the board that give it the edge for me over the damp caverns of D&D's Drizzt and Co.

Admittedly, the game needs some rules tweaks:

For a game clock I use Skeletor's doom track for solo. I also strongly recommend Judd Jensen's Cities of Adventure die roll system (see files section under variants for all these tweaks) which adds oodles of theme; Also, the Frozen Wastes' XP system - level up by paying 1 more than current level - ensures a fast-track start but no runaway leader (a problem with standard base rules).

RB would benefit from the 'daily, at will and utility' battle card system of D&D's excellent Drizzt and 'Loft, but RB has plenty of its own whizzo weapons and special items than can be activated in battle in a not too dissimilar fashion, especially if you get a few weapon and item add-on packs.

RATING: 7.5
This is a cool little game in the Runebound/Descent universe.  Each player has a hero and you move around the board fighting encounters, getting stronger with the intent of killing runelords and becoming the all powerful.  Kind of like a more advanced Talisman.  Fun game but sometimes it can be a little slow during the other player's turns.  The expansion with the islands is cool and there's another expansion where all the players fight against one player which seems like more fun.

Great experience: a whole D&D campaign rolled into one evening. Mechanically, though, the execution comes off as terribly monotonous; the game lasts way too long when offering so little variety.

Outstanding adventure game. The Hero customization/specializing is ideal. The markets, challenges, goals and everything right down to the flavor text on the cards is ace. Spot on. There is a feeling of multi-solo play, which is not a bad thing at all, but it can become an agressive, conflict-style semi-co-op game if the players would rather go that way.

***Update***

Like many competitive dungeon crawlers, the game works well as a 2-player game.  For each player beyond the second, knock two points off the rating due to downtime issues.

***Original Review***

Thirty minutes into our four-hour game, it was obvious that only one player had any chance of winning.  (Me, it turns out, but that didn't make the game any more fun.)

Another race-to-kill game that is much less kid-friendly - in terms of complexity, downtime, and player versus player combat - than Return of the Heroes.

If I ever play Runebound again, it will not be with more than three players.  And I'll definitely be using the fast "level up" rules.

This is a great adventure game, although my wife doesn't like it because it took us from 830pm until 3am one night to play through.  Of course, that's with becoming reacquainted with the rules and teaching a 6 year old and 7 year old to play also.  And yes, they actually stayed up to finish.  I'm looking forward to trying out the expansions as well.

Feels a bit like an 80s computer game to me. Comparable to Talisman but more structured. The art is nerdy.

I like fantasy, I like dice. I don't enjoy Runebound.
Too much downtime, takes way to long and I dislike the combat.

I much prefer WoW TBG.

The market deck is what is amazing about this game. I guess very luck driven again, but good fun for the ride.

Better dice system and plastic models. Better board. Doom track to put a time limit on the game.

I guess I see the attraction here, but it is just not my kind of game. This game has a big rich-get-richer aspect to it - if you gamble on a tough quest and succeed, you win big. If you fail, you are set back quite a lot. 
The travelling-dice mechanic feels superfluous, drawing a lot of time and focus to the moving-around-the-map part of the game, away from the battling-monsters part.

Game plays a little long for my tastes.  I consider it a requirement to use the FFG variants from the back of the rulebook to shorten gameplay...and yet when I want a good fantasy adventure romp about I always grab this one.

I have not been able to get into the game. The board is an eye sore. I really like the combat though. Been thinking about dragging this out and giving it a solo play/re-review. Card expansions are very difficult to find at this point and game feels incomplete without them. May wait on word of a new edition.

RATING: 8
Fantasy role playing game.  Roll the dice, move around the board.  Battle card drawn enemies, and increase your power (or die miserably) for an hour or 3 then be the first to succesfully face the bad-guy and win the game.  I really enjoy rpg type games.  Probably beacause of my memories of Talisman.  This one is especially cool because it can easily be played solo without having make  believe friends playing with you.

This is a slow game where the other players, waiting for their turn to act, really don't give a damn about what you are doing. Asocial gaming.

I like runebound a lot, it's not the deepest game out there, but it's a great thematic experience. You tell a new story everytime. It's even enjoyable solo.

Like all the big box expansions of it. Play differs a lot between the versions

This is one of the games I classify as a 'must-be-in-the-right-mood'-game. I only play it with a really good friend of mine who is, just like me, a sucker for RPG's (the video games). To my own dismay, I own the Dutch version, and I've come to the conclusion that games with a fantasy theme (whether they are boardgames or videogames) can NOT be translated to Dutch, for some of the translations are just ridiculous. But still, it's a fun game.

[b]BRILLIANT RPG-LITE ADVENTURE GAME.[/b]

I traded away Risk:LOTR for this big-boxed beauty, so it HAD to be good. And how!

I wanted an adventure game similar to Talisman, et al, that would allow players to explore a fantasy game-world in boardgame form. This is that game. The hunt has been called off!
On the climb up Geek Mountain, this is one of the wayposts.

The graphic design on the cards, and the artwork itself, is up there with the very best in CCGs. The board is thick, sturdy, and functional; a little more fancy touches on the board would have been nice though - but it's no biggy. The components are uniformly excellent, and the box big enough to fill with other bits and bobs too, like expansion packs, etc.
The rules are clear, with examples; nothing is that complicated for a hardened gamer.
The card and dice driven systems work very well. The movement dice are certainly unique, and try their best to simulate the sometimes frustrating holdups you get with a hike in the wilderness.
Combat is handled particularly effectively, and more intricately than I was expecting; a multi-phase affair with allies jumping into the fray, runes cast, large broadswords swung, and artifacts/abilities used. This leads to multiple decisions by the player on any given turn. It is also one of the superior facets of the game, lifting the life-or-death melees well above the likes of Talisman, Dungeon, and the Warlock of Firetop Mtn.

Some say that the central quest maybe a tad hackneyed.
So what?
You get to travel a strange land, sword in hand, looking for villainous dragons to slay - that's how I want an adventure game to pan out for pity's sake!
If you are looking for variety, other expansions with alternate endgames can be bought.
Crucially, this game is FUN. A great deal of geeky pleasure can be wrought from forging a hero from humble beginnings, and then wielding her with a firm hand once she has become all-powerful. Just like in real life. Ha!

It should be noted, however, that the game atmosphere is enormously enhanced, if the players read the flavour text on the cards to each other. This contributes  to the game's storytelling aspect instead of the game merely being a card-flipping, dice-rolling excercise, and transforms the experience into a Fighting Fantasy book style experience. The truth being, that if you're not in the mood to descend into the spirit of Runebound, you might as well not bother getting the box down from the shelf.

Timewise, the game trots along with 1/2 players, but really starts to grind at 3+. At this point my score would drop to a solid 8 or a droopy 7, players depending.

[b]As a rule of thumb, deduct 2 points from my rating for each player beyond the first.[/b]

[b]GAME-HACKER TIPS:[/b]

1. Ditch the Doomtrack rules - use a house rule.
2. Replace/paint the figures.
3. Replace Doomtrack tokens with pewter skulls.
4. Replace the coins with ersatz gold.
5. Replace XP tokens with glass pebbles.
6. Ban PvP duelling.

Now you're ready to eviscerate dragonkind with the very best of us.

All in all, this game does everthing that could be asked of it, and then a little bit more. I would certainly not turn down a game, and heartily advise all who like this sort of thing to buy it.
Runebound also plays marvellously well solo.

I own a ridiculous number of card expansions for this game!

I really like the look of this game and even if the combat system isn't exactly intuitive... it is kind of fun.  However the huge downtime and total lack of interest in other players turns makes this the only thematic "multi-player solitaire" I can think of.  I might try it again sometime with just two players... but no more.

RATING: 7
This game feeds my need to level up and kill things.  On the downside its also terribly long.  So long that as of right now we have to plan an entire day around it.

Player interaction is very low as well, but despite all its flaws my group really enjoys it.

RATING: 9
Quite likely the most customizable board game out there, Runebound suffers from being a very slow game, taking hours- even days- to finish, with serious downtime between turns. While the individual elements are nothing too creative, overall the game presents itself well.

Despite its length, a favorite of my gaming groups.

Significantly better than 1st Edition.  I like using the Doom Track to keep the length down and the Random Encounters for some chance wilderness fighting.  A decent system with some excellent movement rules.  Infinitely expandable.

Holee... If you have the choice between Arkham Horror and this... get this. It fixes everything that is wrong with that game!

Hasn't seen much play yet, so it might see upgrades or downgrades.

Edit: Downgraded quite a lot. This lacks the variety of gameplay that Arkham Horror has. Too much fighting, too little else. Still, they both seem to have the same replayability. It's just that Runebound starts to drag on after the third hour or so...

Only play the shorter Runebound variant!

I'm not a big fan of this game.  The mechanics are ok, but it feels like everyone's playing their own solitaire game which defeats the point of playing a game in a group in my opinion.  I'll opt for almost anything else on game night.

Aha.  Now this is MUCH better.  Pretty much all the issues with the previous game have been addressed, they ditched those awful character chit tearers, sorry, holders, for plastic minis, and the whole thing just seems a lot tighter.  Game length can still be an issue, but I can live with that.
My one BIIIIIIIGGGGG problem with this is that merely ONE YEAR after releasing the 1st Edition, FFG bring out this (albeit significantly improved) version.  Don't they playtest games over there?

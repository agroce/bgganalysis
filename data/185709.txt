Excellent co-op/family game. Dead simple while having a lot of layers to explore, and I mean genuinely explore. The game and it's layers of complexity reveal themselves slowly, like a video game. This has a lot to do with the fact that it's half video game, but it allows you to discover new mechanics as you play, instead of ingesting them all at once via a rulebook. Worth checking out.

A nice combination of a board game and a app. Graphics are cute and so are the pieces. There are two problems: I don’t really like dexterity games and it’s really pricey.

More of an activity than an actual game, but either way it's pretty fun. I like puzzling out how to get the best possible scores, and have been pleasantly surprised at how thinking outside the box seems to be rewarded.

Something that should be mentioned, the components are absolute top-tier quality. The little animals are both adorable and sturdy.

This is an imaginative game that plays like a cooperative Animal Upon Animal mixed with a Pokemon world building electronic backdrop. The fun comes from the exploration of the world building mechanisms and this is engaging. There's a collector sensation that's interesting where you're trying to discover all of the animal hybrid breeds as well.

However, I do think the game is a bit limiting with what comes in the base box. There's simply not enough animal types so you become limited in the physical aspect of the game. You also really want the electronic world displayed on a large screen to keep everyone locked in, as this is where most of the magic happens.

I'm a big fan of dexterity games and was very excited to try this out but unfortunately it was terrible. The pieces don't really stack all that well, the app is super boring and didn't work on my iPad (kept crashing after starting), it did work on my iPhone but it didn't help the game, and the game just wasn't fun. I played it 3 times to make sure I was trying it enough but after all was said and done, I would rather play a hundred other dex games like Tummple, Click Clack Lumberjack, Junk Art, or Villa Palletti. Add in the fact that it's incredibly expensive and CONGRATULATIONS, you have my first ever rating of a 1.

RATING: N/A
This is a solitaire puzzle, not a "game" in the traditional sense. (To play with someone else, you simply each play the whole game and see who gets a higher score.) That said, it is pretty fun. The powers and effects that appear in the app add strategy to the stacking, although the ones that require you to keep an eye on them and react to things on the screen can be annoying.

RATING: 8.25
This is a very cool implementation of a physical game that works in conjunction with an app.  The balancing aspect of the game is quite interesting because the pieces are all unique in size and shape.  And the app side of the game is seamless and fun.  My 4 year old daughter enjoys unlocking new species and reading about them.  My son enjoys trying to get a high score and everything else involved.  But I'm probably the person that enjoys it the most.  This is the first board game I've played where you have to explore a bit to understand all of the rules.  Normally I would not like this, but it works very nicely with this game because it's not too difficult to explore and discover how everything works together.

This stacking game truly breaks the mold of what a game can be, and not simply because it renders the game pieces into a beautiful digital landscape. This game is unique because it is not about the pursuit for points, or optimal strategies, but rather discovery and experimentation. Each beast can be 'crossed' with the others to create strange and impossible combinations. These animals and fusions can also be 'migrated' to benefit from various elements. This creates a vast world for players to explore, unearthing new forms with each play. But meanwhile, player's must prevent their world from collapsing both externally (having your delicate tower collapse into oblivion), and internally (neglecting animals such that they go extinct), providing a firm balance and connection between the analog and digital worlds.

Very interesting game, however... I do not own an ipad or tab that I could really play this on. Phone seems like it would cut in on the experience. 

Also seems like you HAVE to have an app, or it will not work. 

Would be fun as an activity for kids though... so will wait and see.

This game is a lot of fun. Pros: It's cute, discovering new animals for the bestiary is fun, and it's pretty quick and easy to learn. Cons: You have to deal with the video screen, which adds a lot to what would otherwise be a simple stacking game, but that kind of thing is not for everyone.

A truely unique implementation of the app supported Board Game idea. At its core this is Jenga with animal pieces but while it looks simple the app makes it so much more. Using the artefacts to migrate, cross-breed and boost your creatures, all the while adding to a bestiary of hundreds, really keeps this game engaging. The price tag may be too high for some but the fun you and your family will have with this may be worth it.

Awesome dexterity game.  It's a cross between Jenga and Pokemon.

My 6 year old has been playing the base game non-stop trying to create all the different animals.  He's been having a blast setting new high scores. We've been impressed with his balancing and reasoning skills.  It's not easy to figure out all the combinations of animals needed to make new breeds but he's working it all out.

Can't wait for the battle expansion to be released.

I like this a lot more than my wife does, but I feel as though this is primarily a single player game. While it's undoubtedly beautiful -- a work of art -- I feel as though it suffers too much from its freeform nature. I would like to see some rules, similar to Junk Art, and actual requirement for more than one player so it doesn't end up being one assertive player playing and everyone else watching. I also fear that my strategy might end up being based upon a similar formula game after game. There needs to be some random element involved to keep this fresh and to make it feel more like a game.

This is a fun activity that everyone seems to enjoy. One of the best dexterity challenges I've encountered, but not really much of a game. Perhaps that will change when the expansion arrives.

This game was not for me.

This is a cooperative high-score game with an element of discovery via the app. If you have a small, fixed group that can play it gradually over time you could have fun exploring the probability space. The physical pieces and the app are charming. 

Since I don't care about points and play with a rotating game group this was just not a good fit.

(final) Lovely final production quality; no technical hitches here.  Giving this game a Weight is tricky - it's clearly a very light game, but there is more subtlety to the design than initially appears; getting a decent high score is not trivial.
(prototype) Had the chance to play this a couple of times at Gamecamp and was delighted that it lived up to my expectations.  At the moment, the app part of the game is a little unfinished, but the central components - the models, the base and the interactions - all worked well and felt fun.  
I am uncertain about the longevity of the game itself; there aren't that many bits, although to be fair, all them are interesting and definitely combine in neat ways. But I expect the novelty to wear off fairly quickly, and it will then have to compete with other building games.  New beasts and extended app backing will probably help with this though.

This interesting coop game (activity?) has a fascinating combination of an app and stacking animals.  The app is pretty and fun, and the main focus of the game is to learn how to play the game by experimenting with pieces and the app.  While it seems like a great interactive activity for a family, the price tag may be a hindrance.

Played a friends copy "two player" taking turns to stack. but I could see how playing single player would allow you to explore all the combinations that could be made. I wonder how much play would be left after completing the bestiary

First saw the game at Thirsty Meeples game cafe in Oxford. Helped very slightly in playtesting. Innovative, accessible mix of physical and imaginative. Something the whole family can join in with, the plinth and tower acting as a centrepiece. Absolutely love Beasts of Balance and can't wait for my published copy to arrive!

This is a very fun activity that I can easily get my grandchildren interested in.  I do think it will have a relatively short lifespan as it's novelty wears out and scores start to stabilize.

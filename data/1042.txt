Got this in the math trade.  It looks pretty fun and quick.  Very fun game!  We tried the basic version with four, and Nate destroyed us by collecting the silver coins instead of trying for the gem sets.  Can't wait to try it with the magical objects and different scoring rules![update] The magical items are essential and add a lot to the game.  Definitely best played with 6!

+ Plays quickly and keeps things moving throughout with a timer; The theme of getting treasure and having to split it is pretty well done.
- Negotiation games only work with some kinds of game groups (not really my group's favorite thing).


Why it's previously-owned:
I think that negotiating is fun and clever inside of a bigger context, but really wasn't that great as the only focal point of this game. 
I ended up trading this away for Colossal Arena and Pergamon.

Immortal classic. Very easy to pick up and play, explaining, how it works is fast, but it is still interesting to play for "veteran" players. Main idea of speed-arguing works really well, it's tense, especially in 3+ arguments. Magic cards give enough variety to be replayable and feel not so basic. Black diamond is an awesome feature, unrippable from the game. Components are good, the wooden discs are just the right size, cards feel good, though the bag kinda stucks all the time, when you pull strings. As for me - it's a really good game, suited for the most of players, pleasant and fun to play.

The dividing of treasure thing breaks down if not in the right group.  I tried to do a "If I don't get what I want, nobody gets anything" move, and it didn't go over well...  Some of the spell cards are WAY too powerful, while others are really weak.

Definitely a unique game--I have nothing like it in my large collection.  If you like negotiation games, it's probably a must-have.  Can feel a little samey, but the interesting twist on negotiations will keep it coming back to the table.  The magic cards are very dynamic and powerful; they add a nice little twist to the otherwise simple and straightforward game play.  There's even a card that grants you the ability to steal jewels off the dragon cards in the center of the table until you get caught (at which point you must discard the card and lose the ability, but you still get to keep everything you already stole!).

RATING: 7.5
Snappy game that boils down negotiating to the ruthless essentials. Despite the name this is not a fantasy game, it could almost just as easily be about bank robbers falling out over their loot. There's more tactics to the order in which you play your four adventurer cards than meets the eye at first, but the heart of the game lies in how you argue with other adventurers for your share of the dragon's treasure. Too diplomatic and you might not get enough, too demanding and you might find adventurers unwilling to join you on later attacks on dragons. It's at its best when negotiations are deadlocked and that sand timer is nearly empty...so long as you're not playing with someone who's taking it too seriously.
On the minus side, the art work on the adventurer cards, especially the knights, is a bit naff. Also, the coloured translucent plastic gemstones are lovely but the silver and gold treasure is hard to distinguish, though this was easily solved with a lick of gold paint of a deeper shade. But these are minor niggles in what can be an intense shouty 45 minutes.
Update. Earlier games were four player, which were good, but bumped up rating after a great six player game (even though I lost).

This game hadn't really anything special for me.  On each turn you need to put one of your adventures under a dragon and try to defeat it's toughness.  You still need to keep a couple of things in mind though. 

Big problem for me with this version is that you actually have a lot of cards in spare.  There is one pile that you use with every game.  But there are specialist cards on which info in your own language stands.  In the multilingual edition you get this specialist deck in 4 different languages.  This leaves you with 3 decks that you won't use in your games and these 3 decks actually contain more cards then the deck you will be playing the game with.

Great filler game.  Works best with people who are willing to negotiate.  One or more players who could either care less what they get, or are so selfish that no deals are made, are the death of this game.  *If a card allows you to "cheat", is it really cheating?  Once opponents are aware the invisible hand exists, making it worthwhile is very difficult.  [Gift]

One of our most beloved and hated games of all time for my group. Devoting one of your 4 characters to defeat a dragon on the board is easy. Other players go there too and you beat it when there sum is higher than the dragon. The hard part is for all involved in the victory deciding who gets what treasure. Oh yeah, if you don't decided in 30 seconds, nobody gets it!

Tarde casi seis meses en jugarlo.

Es un juego de matar dragones y repartir el tesoro. La mecánica principal es la negociación, puesto que una vez que se mata el dragón, los participantes en su muerte disponen de un minuto para repartir el tesoro. Si no llegan a un acuerdo, el tesoro se pierde.

Muy divertido en grupos grandes. Admite hasta seis jugadores.

Second play took a bit of the shine off the first play. I initially had this at an 8, and I think it may largely be based on who you play with.

Took it down to a 7 but will see how it fares on subsequent plays.

Players play their heroes to various dragons, with the heroes eventually slaying the dragons. At the point when a dragon is slain, all players who had played a card to that dragon must negotiate for the dragon's loot in a set amount of time. If players can agree, the loot is split as agreed. If they can't agree, no one gets any of the loot.

At the end of the game, various types of loot are worth various amounts of points.

It's no surprise that I really didn't enjoy this game, as I generally hate negotiation games, and that's about all there was to this game other than the very simple card play. I suppose I could be convinced to play again if everyone else loved the game, but I'd turn it down in the future if possible.

Update 9-9-08:  Every deal it seems like it is a zero sum game--I take more, you take less, I win, you lose.  Traders of Genoa, because of hidden values, trades feels more like you win, I win a little more.  It does not seem like it is easy to make a win-win negotiation.  

Not even close to being Traders of Genoa.

UPDATE: I've decided there's not really enough to this game to make it an 8. And the negotiation can seem somewhat dry. Guess I'm not cut-throat enough either to thoroughly enjoy this or to do it well. Or maybe that's just sour grapes cuz I never seem to win! Then again, I've played only a few times. And it is fun when everyone uncovers their hoard at the end and you get to see whether their strategies paid off.

RATING: 6.5
This is a surprisingly enjoyable ”party”/negotiation game, at least if you play it with the right crowd like I did – I’m well aware that this game can flop if playing with some family members and such. Cunning and brutal negotiations IS the heart of this game; if you cannot barter, dicker about the loot, you have no chance of winning…

The game is extremely simple; you play a card with a value from 1-4 (you all have one of each), and once the total number of cards played equal the dragon’s strength, the dragon is slayed and those involve share the look, i.e. they have 30 seconds to discuss how to split the various gems which you get for killing the dragon (some are shown before the dragon is slayed while some gems are only revealed afterwards).

I like the abilities of the wizard and the thief; they have a low strength, meaning that you arguably won’t have a lot to say once the loot is going to be split, but you can get a powerful card that changes the rules if you have played the wizard, and you can steal a gem from another player if you have played a thief. This means that you don’t want to be in the lead too early or your opponents will steal from you! 

My first game ended with a big victory primarily based on a lot of sets and “most of type X” points , but there are various other strategies to pursue; going for gold (and to a lesser degree silver), going for a lot of sets and obviously the black gem which is a strategy I’m looking forward to pursue!

One thing I don’t like is the fact that somebody can tank the negotiation and simply state that they won’t accept any offer, which means there won’t be a deal… I know this is totally legitimate, but I personally prefer the negotiation and tension of trying to end the deal before the timer runs out.
A good little game – although I certainly wouldn’t play it all the time.

RATING: 6
Rated 6 after one play. Not quite sure what to make of this one. I traded for this game based on the concept of a timed negotiation. But in our first game, we wrapped up pretty much every trade before the timer even came close to running out.

Admittedly, the first play was a hurried play as an opener for a game night. I didn't get a chance to finish the game. It's quite possible we were all too polite and civil, and greater familiarity might make the negotiations more interesting. 

Update: Traded this away, along with Fairy Tale and Medici for Ys. Granted, I wasn't trying to drive a "hard bargain" in a trade, as I'm trying to whittle down my collection, but I just didn't see how I'd play this with any frequency. I have enough negotiation games between Bohnanza, I'm the Boss, Chinatown, and Genoa.

Negotiatate how to share the Dragon's gold after you kill it.  Fairly simple and short (45 min).

RATING: 7
This is a negotiation game and it can get rather heated and nasty...which I think is awesome and hilarious. This one is best played with people you know well. It leads to some interesting conversations and memorable moments.
It's not a game I would be willing to play all the time because it is so intense and requires quite a bit of energy and effort to play well.

*The reprint has TERRIBLE colors for the gems. We could barely tell the difference between the gold and silver gems. We marked all the gold ones with a sharpie to speed things up. All of the colors could stand to be more distinct.

RATING: 4
For whatever reason, I found this negotiation game to be considerably lacking, I think primarily because it doesn't have the pure nastiness of similar games like Intrige or even Fantasy Business.  The special cards are mostly a bust, causing groans whenever played but the "Invisible Hand" card is absolutely genius and I'd love to see it in another game.  There's some good ideas here (I like the way the thieves and wizards function) but the game was largely mediocre- neither too mechanical nor mechanical enough to really be interesting.

Fun!  I love the aspect of negotiating under the gun of the timer.  The first time I played scoring seemed a little convoluted  (but hey, it was late) and the color issues didn't help.  Is red a gem?  Yellow is gold?  No wait, that is a gem ... but once I got it down I had a lot of fun.  Curiously though seems a bit long and deep to be considered filler but it's quite a meaty game, either.  Kind of a tweener.  I like it!

RATING: 7
Fun game of teaming up to kill dragons and then negotiating how to split the treasure - if you can't agree in one minute, no one gets anything.  Best if played a little quickly and with light spirits.  I recommend using the advanced rules (they are not that different).  It's best to be a part of as many deals as you can, but in a game with more players, this can be difficult.  Be prepared for the typical Faidutti chaotic touches (which I like).  Since I'm not a big fan of "legal cheating," I never play with the Invisible Hand magic object card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Typical Faidutti material: create a silly mechanic, throw in plenty of chaos, and let the players bluff, lie, cajole, trade, laugh, cry and shout their way to victory. Strictly speaking it is fairly interesting that with the simple mechanic of 'bidding' on open dragons it is possible to create so many problems for the players as to how to divide the loot, but the game simply lasts too long to remain fun, and favours those with better memories. You can't win against those people, and by introducing the chaotic spell cards to destroy their hidden counting the entire bartering process loses its appeal very quickly. There should be some point to the negotiations, especially if they occur as often in this game: negotiating based on a position of bluff is just silly if kept up for too long.

I love this game. Everyone seems to have a great time. I've only had the chance to play the basic rules. Can't wait to try it with spells! But even just the basic version, it's already a great game in my opinion!

Update: I had one game with the advanced rules (spells) and it went well! Spells had some nice backstabbing opportunities, surprises and a little randomness. It works really well.

Components: Recognizable player colors distinguish the otherwise identical sets of adventurer cards. The cards don't see much wear, so their durability is not a huge issue. The dragon cards are attractive and clear. The wooden treasures, the bag, and the player screens are all welcome.

Experience: Interesting hand management (of only 4 cards), trying to time it just right to slay dragons or steal gold. The negotiation facet has not been a huge component in my games. I have only played without the special action cards.

Really straight forward negotiation game with some small element of hand management. Colorful gem components and card art. Multiple minor variant rules, two modes of play, and card powers increases this game's replayability a little bit.

The two strongest elements of this game also could hurt it the most. Depending on players, hard negotiations can totally tank the game for some though a meta could evolve from it. Secondly there's a neat card that lets you steal gems while no one is looking which is a cool concept but may not sit well with some.

There's also a memory element to this game in terms of tracking gems.

Great fun. I like the fact that the point of the game is the fight over the treasure, not necessarily the actual dragon slaying. The special powers of the thief and the wizard add an interesting element. The Invisible Hand card is brilliant; it lets the holder of the card steal treasure from a dragon, prior to slaying, if  no other players discover the  theft. Lots of fun and playable in less than an hour.

Fun game that can get choatic at times when you try to divide treasures under a time limit. The main problem is that there's always someone who always choose the my way or no way in deals which can make the game boring. I recommend that you remove the cheat card as well if you want to avoid fights. ;)

RATING: 4
Players play their hero cards against four face up dragons in order to get a say in how the treasure is divided.  Once a dragon is slain, involved players have one minute to agree on dividing the treasure (lots of different coloured wooden bits).  Once all dragons are slain, players total up their treasure sets.  Pretty good - haven't tried the advanced rules (looks to be more Faidutti chaos!)

I've had one gameplay with 3 players. It was excellent. There is a bit of a memory element, but I mostly just went on my gut feel for how many gems each player had. Negotiations were competitive, but we never reached a stalemate. The fear of getting nothing is very motivating to reach a compromise. I've also played this with 6 and it worked well.

At first, I thought this game would be great.  Divide up the dragon's treasure before time expires.  Then I discovered how little I liked the scoring system and how certain strategies just didn't work. What kind of sense does the black diamond make?  Here, I'll take 15 points and lose the 30 that everyone else seems to have.  No thanks.

EDIT: Played again with the wife and kids using the "simple" scoring rules. A little better. Still not a favorite. Also, in multiple games spanning years I think I've only ever had 1 negotiation fail. Maybe my friends and family are a bunch of appeasers, but the timer mechanic just doesn't seem to apply to us.

Faiduttis. :-). Könnyed játék, egyszerű szabályokkal, egy kis sárkányvadászat kalandozókkal. Hatan is gyors. Két verziójából az alap, a legyőzött sárkány kincsein adott idő alatt osztozkodjanak a győzők: pont ezért ki lehet futni az időből, ez inkább a party jellegűbb verzió, ez is izgalmas. Aztán próbáltuk a stratégiai verziót, az kiegyensúlyozottabb, és izgalmasabb: a kalandozó csapat leggyengébbje osztja a csapat részének megfelelő számú részre a kincseket, majd a legerősebb visz el egyet, aztán a második, és legutoljára leggyengébb.
Mindkét verzió jó volt, és 6-an is gyors játék, kellő izgalommal fűszerezve. Tetszik.

Very light negotiation game that begins with simple card play, followed by a timed argument over how to split the loot from a dragon kill. Great filler to begin a game night. I drew a card that let me steal gems from the table, so long as I was not caught. I made off like a bandit before everyone started to question why the gem pile looked smaller. That alone made this game worth playing.

Played once.  Initial impression is fast, simple, and fun.  The sand timer adds an element of tension to the negotiation, which is where most of the fun in this game comes from.  It's interesting to see two players each stare at the timer as the sand runs out, each hoping that the other player will give in.  Scoring is a little unclear in the advanced game.

* Played 15+ times. First game I ever played with Alan Moon, and he and I teamed up several times to kill dragons and split treasure amicably. Had a blast. PURE negotiation game. Quick, fun, and very social. Nice artwork too. (Wish the bits weren't so small and round; they roll right off the table...) Great 4-6 player game IF you like negotiating. Recommended. All my friends, and all my family love this game. Once the novelty wears off the base game, add in the action cards to make it a little more chaotic, but a lot of fun. [tr:KotE]

I had not expected to like this game.

A game of knights, wizards & thieves who slay dragons in order to get treasure.  Killing the dragons is easy, but the heart of the game are the negotiations to divvy up the rewards between those who helped slay the dragon.  I generally do not like negotiating games, but this one is tempered by a one-minute timer.  If players can't agree, all is lost.  Of course this game is ruined if one person refuses to bargain and manages to help slay every dragon.  I found that negotiations more often failed near the end of the game if everyone needed the same thing.

It comes in a small box that fits the game (always good) and the game is colorful.

This was a $10 game, but because of its modest price, the treasure pieces are small & easily lost, the screens are too short, and text on the cards is too small.  Despite this you are still getting a lot for your money.  

Rules include an advanced version which I have not played--Magic Object Cards are introduced (text with very small print)which prolong the game.  I think the length is just right now, so I am not eager to play the extended version.

With occasional play (which is what it will get) the rules will take 10 minute review, which is okay, so will keep this one.

Dragon's Gold is a negotiation game that is pretty basic at heart.  Sometimes you're going for metals, and so the decision on what you want is obvious.  Sometimes you're going for gems, and your opponents are supposed to negotiate for their own needed gems but then I guess keep you from getting your gems as well?  But also you have to keep things feeling a little fair so that the deal doesn't fail in the one minute that is given.  Wizards want red jewels, so that's obvious.  In fact, lots of the decision making is either obvious (when it comes to metals or red jewels) or you really have no idea what your opponent needs in terms of the gems, so you just try to barter for what you need.  Things could get nasty, but it would be a little arbitrary. Honestly, I can't figure out if there's a good way to play this game.  It all feels little random and the negotiating is rarely interesting and feels rushed even at that.  It's got some cute ideas but there are enough negotiation games that are solid that this really isn't a game that floats to the top when thinking of the genre.  It's a little too wash-and-repeat for my like. Maybe if it was 20 minutes, but 45 is a little too long.

Played for 2nd time the other night at game night as an inbetween waiting to play another game. It was easy to understand after a few plays, and light fun. We all enjoyed and one I'd easily take out for beginning or end of game night playing. One I think that will be enjoyed by nongamers and gamers alike. You can decide nicely to split the wood pieces or you can go back and forth trying to take the colors you need and want but of course, so does the person you're splitting the jewels with. I didn't like when there was a 3 way split and I was happy with my take, but the other 2 couldn't decide, so when timer ran out, and they couldn't decide, I didn't get anything either. Now that's not fair!! Part of the game. FUN!!!

[Original comment] Played once. Not wild about the quality of the tiny pieces of treasure, as they tend to roll off the table easily. But, the concept of the game is neat. We will play this more, but may replace the bits with our own.

May 2009 -- I would like to play this again, but with limited game time available, it's just not that high on the selection list.

September 2009 -- We finally played again and enjoyed it very much. My daughter drew the card that allowed her to legitimately steal treasures, and none of the rest of us recalled it being in the deck. She was completely successful in her sleight-of-hand activities for the entire game, and actually won the game, partially because of that card. We will play this again.

My group hates playing this with me.  I will occasionally refuse to negotiate, causing lots of treasure to be lost.  Cruel?  Yes.  But I do tend to win.

The best example how one component can make the game unique. One-minute-sandtimer that limits the time for negotiations. If you don't make it in that minute - the loot is gone. So you better hurry. Or not? Maybe you'll block others so that they won't get anything?

Looks like a typical Faidutti game but this one mechanism makes the game worth playing. Try it - it's certainly an unforgettable experience :-)

Based on first game (3P).  Good negotiation game, but it takes a play or two to get a better feel for what the different treasures are worth.  Myself and another player were competing for color sets, and the third ran away with the win by getting the black diamond, many silvers, and a few too many golds.  Felt just a little too long for what it is.  Might reduce the number of dragons by two next time.

RATING: 5
Okay game of haggling, strongarming, backstabbing and petty disputes.  My choice of words probably reveals that I'm not inclined to enjoy such activities.  I like negotiation, but there's really not much to negotiate here - you're just trying to get a bigger slice of the pie than the other guys, and as many slices as possible.  Dragon's Gold is especially known for the Invisible Hand card, which permits a player to cheat so long as no one notices.  Some folks hate the card, but I actually think it's the best part of the game.

RATING: 5
This one is a blue box Descartes game that is pretty cool. You have different point value of heroes that you add up in stacks with the other players until you kill dragons with the stack total exceeding the dragon's health. Anyone that was involved in the fight gets a crack at dividing up a random handful of loot with a 1 minute timer. This game is a lot of fun unless you get a stubborn person in the group that will not agree to any reasonable treasure split, then the game doesn't work and nobody has a good time.

Dragon's Gold is right up my dark, dank labyrinthine alley.   It presents as a simple, colourful co op. Play a card, kill a dragon and share the loot.  Turns out, it's actually a bit of a bastard; you play a card, kill a dragon and then punch your partner in the face.  Winning is as glorious as losing is painful; it takes a moment for that 'kicked in the gut' feeling to subside.  I love games that facilitate 'congenial confrontation', like Dragon's Gold and Intrigue. But they're not for everyone.

Very basic and light negotiation game where players cooperate to slay dragons and must divide the treasure, with some chaotic special power cards added to the mix. If the time for negotiation expires and the players don't agree on how to divide the treasure, they take nothing. That doesn't always work, because a player can easily sabotage the negotiation by demanding an absurd share of the treasure. Otherwise, it may be a fine, albeit unremarkable, family game.

Like Munchkin, this should work best with RPG players. The game lives and dies by the players. If you are not into it, it will be boring. If you like the theme and all, you'll find a nice small game.

Not superb, but not trash either.  Very enjoyable with groups of three or four (though I wouldn't go higher than that).  Negotiation is the proper way to play this one, and I suggest you use a sand timer to enforce bargaining.  The game bogs down otherwise.

Very good negotiation game aimed at set collecting.  Non-typical (real time negotiations with hourglass).  Could be agressive from the beginning - depends on the players. But at some point it ALWAYS becomes agressive ;)

EDIT: The fun is dependent on the group - the latter should not be too shy and agreeable nor too arrogant and pushing to win over dead bodies.  Sometimes you miss this ideal target one way or the other  ;)

EDIT 2: 2011-2012 edition is hopeless.  Poor quality components and TRAGIC (ugly and unclear) graphics.  I'll definitely stick with my 2001 blue box.

Great dragon killing fun, especially for role players. The best part is that you have to share the treasure, otherwise you lose it all. I don't like everything from Faidutti, but this is a little gem.

I really enjoy this light, but evil negotiation game.  It reminds me a bit of Cosmic Encounter, but much less involved... and with dragons.  Yeah.  It had me at Dragons (I'm such a sucker).

The artwork is darn good in the White Goblin edition, and the tin is very nice, too.  Would perhaps like to see plastic jewels instead of the wooden discs in a future edition?  Still the wooden discs are serviceable and better than cubes here.  Some of the magic items can swing the game in interesting directions, so be prepared for that.  There are some good decisions to be made here, but the point of the game is not so much in the strategic play, but in the negotiations, which I find to be super fun (for the most part).  

Just one tiny problem:  The enjoyment of this game is EXTREMELY dependent upon the group you're playing with.  One or two bad apples can outright ruin this game for everyone, or the wrong group can make it into a boring affair if everyone isn't interested in actually competing/winning and negotiating to get their way (sometimes by any means necessary!).  

A keeper.

Based on 5 plays.  DG has served as an excellent introductory game.  Aside from the scoring, the rules are simple and the learning curve quite gentle - everyone understands the bluff and bluster tactics of bargaining.  The timed negotiations are brief by definition, and the whole game moves along at a clip pace.  Best of all, DG is viscerally fun.  Who doesn't enjoy egging on their friends as they frantically argue over the proper division of treasure?  However, you do need to play with the right crowd, or else the game can get a bit nasty.

The game does have two marks against it, though.  The end-game scoring can be a bit scattered, since it's very difficult to keep track of how many gems you need to secure a majority.  If someone doesn't like to play nice at the negotiations and others take it personally, the game would get pretty old pretty fast.  But as long as people take it in a light-hearted spirit, neither of these problems is too serious.

Great game. Great and crazy. Super simple, all about negotiation. It's also light and plays up to six players which is cool. The theme is "childish" but works great, artwork is kind of silly but nice for most of the cards except for the magic items.

I'm not sure I like how all the magic items work- they are a bit random. I hate those wooden tokens that are used for gems... they could use something shiny. Also if the game was rereleased why did these terrible artworks on the items stayed the same? It's impossible to accept.

This is a very chaotic game with various random, hidden, and targeted elements.  Dissent is also built into the game's mechanics through a timed negotiation phase, where failure to agree results in a loss for all involved.  People hide their acquisitions behind screens, but they can also lose these items through blindly targeted thief actions made by the other players.  Winnings include randomly drawn items, split through negotiation.  All in all, the game is too chaotic for the time investment given my current tastes.

WAIT - coming out with a boxed version.

Negotiation game, with a Dungeon crawler theme. Kill dragons a la Smash up style. Doing so you gain loot, where you have to split the rewards with other players right then, or loss it all. 

Would have to look into more.

[2007.Mar.28] A easy-to-play negotiation game with a fantasy theme. This game plays a bit lopsided when the players are not equal in their negotiating skills.

terrific theme. this isn't a 'serious' negotiation game, which is good for me because i don't like 'serious' negotiation games (quo vadis comes to mind). the timer ensures that the negotiations don't get bogged down, and there's more to the game than just the negotiations, especially if you use the magic items (which you should).

One of Fadutti's greats! If you just want a game about negotiation, this is it.  Bruno really knows how to build a simple game around a deep mechanic. Never subtle, the games always give you tough decisions, but yet are usually really easy to teach.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting negotiation game with a fairly unique scoring system that makes calculating the value of the individual bits of treasure difficult and fun.  The sand timer adds quite a bit of tension to the negotiations.  The magic cards make the game chaotic and keep it light in spirit.  I fell victim to the "Invisible Hand" card that encourages a player to steal tokens from the dragon cards.

RATING: 5
Despite normally not liking negotiation I actually was fine with the brinksmanship here of someone potentially screwing everyone else out of getting nothing, although I can see a lot of people seeing otherwise. The reason I didn't mind is because it is technically in your control to avoid such a situation by offering such a person more.

Card powers seem pretty diverse, but some I felt could lead to too much chaos, and I heard there was one card that allows you to cheat until caught, which I would definitely have hated.

Overall I don't think it is a bad negotiation game, but besides its brinksmanship which I feel lots of people won't like it isn't really anything special.

VERY well done negotiation filler game, for the right people. You have to people willing to get into the negotiations and bribing for the loot. If not, it falls flat on its face. For that reason, it doesn't get out very often. But it is a good game to have for just those perfect times. Nice production, nice bits, very interesting play with no downtime. Great for a bunch of ex-d&d dragonslaying theme lovers.

A fairly enjoyable game that shouldn't be taken too seriously (some people will get mad at each other due to a negotiation that went sour).

Not that it's that hard, but it appeals more to non-gamers that won't want to deal with more than a few rules.

The fun in negotiation games is that they take the chief wrinkle in gaming, player priorities and tactics, and put it front and center.  Dragon’s gold is a negotiation game with the gloves off and in their place all sorts of bionic prosthetics of devious nature as players are given all sorts of tools to aid or just plain circumvent their ability to negotiate.  Rarely do wrinkles on wrinkles result in a resonance that smooths every thing out into a perfectly smooth thing of beauty, but here it does, and its uncanny nature makes for a unique experience.  Where else can you have a negotiation game where one player could benefit from tanking a trade, while the other is ambivalent since they are about to pillage the other player’s stores, all while a third player is sitting back and eyeing a dragon’s horde they alone are in a position to take, and the fourth player doesn’t care at all because he has the card that lets him flat out cheat so he is loving all this lively debate providing the distraction…

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
With the right group, this can be a fun game. The one main down side can be the runaway leader who constantly shuts down negotiations once he gets ahead which would be just really annoying.

With the right group, the negotiating element of the game will obviously be a strong feature and this will cause some challenges for players. If played in the right spirit where everyone negotiates reasonably, not using the shutting down of negotiations as a tactic, however legitimate, it is generally fun. You need to keep track of how many of each of the different types of treasure tokens are potentially available so there is an important “token counting” element which I didn’t particularly enjoy but I can see that it would suit some players. I just lost track and although I enjoyed the experience, I will always fare poorly against those who are better at “token counting”.

So, I have mixed feelings about Dragon’s Gold. I found it fun but I think that it was largely because I have a fun social gaming group. I can see that I would hate it with the wrong people. I don’t overly enjoy negotiating games or ”token counting” games generally and this game has both aspects. I do like the semi-cooperative aspect of teaming up at times against a Dragon and having to think how best to play your Adventurers. I wouldn’t say its a bad game and I think it is a well designed game, but its just really not my kind of game and I suspect won’t suit everyone.

I cannot fathom why people like this more than Fantasy Business. Is it because it's a Faidutti game? Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed myself. And the timed negotiation means filibustering is a legitimate tactic (normally in negotiation games the filibusterer is negatively penalized - such as civil unrest in Diplomacy.) Still, I felt like there was far more tension in Fantasy Business than in Dragon's Gold. I won't say no to another game, and I could see this scratching a negotiation itch as filler on a night where no other negotiation games will hit the table. But honestly, for the time time and the theme, I will take Intrigue, Traders of Genoa, or even Fantasy Business over this one I think.

After some consideration, I know this will NEVER get played by my playgroup, and it was only moderately well received by the kids in gaming club at school. 

Traded away.

I've only played this with my two daughters.  With the three of us it can unfortunately lead to bickering which I then have to head off.  But I've played it with them individually quite a bit as a two-player.  Has a nice goofy theme, and the collecting of jewels and coins (small wooden bits) is fun.  There is some trading strategy in there as well where you are trying to get the most of any given jewel-type.  Probably a game most suitable for a preteen-adult mix.

Bruno Faidutti game, theme based on adventurers killing dragons then splitting the loot. Depending which adventurers you used (thief, magician), you get a special action (rob someone, get a magic card).

RATING: 5
---- Preliminary thoughts ----

All the game revolves about the negociation when killing dragons. If a deal is not struck in 45 seconds, nobody will get anything. That is, you will spend 45 minutes negociating with other players and that can be too much if you don't like that.

The game doesn't offer much more than that. Secret set collections will give you points.

The idea is not revolutionary, but it's nice. I would like the game much more if it was a 15 minutes filler with the same mechanics, but there doesn't seem to be any easy way to shorten the lenght (the scoring mechanism would be greatly unbalaced).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The timed negotiation is great for people (like me) who think other negotiation games can drag on just a little too long sometimes.  There's also a couple of cards that will allow you to cheat, as long as you don't get caught.  Good fun.

RATING: 7
Light fantasy themed negotiation game. I'm not too much into negotiation games but this is so light (and there's time limit!) and fun game to play it is okay. Needs at least 4 players to be fun though. Probably best with 5 players. There are elements that make it a very mean game sometimes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cheeky and very quick negotiation game in which players must defeat dragons and then settle for the right distribution of the loot (there are different kinds of chips, which can be combined differently for scores). Funnily enough the game is not quite as nasty on the table as it reads on paper: there is hardly any time to make a single proposition, let alone reach an impasse, so that players have got no other way than being constructive.

Gioco di carte semplice e immediato con una simpatica presenza di fattori persuasivi e diplomatici. Il gioco si fa preferire con l'aumentare dei giocatori anche se il tutto risulterà più ingovernabile. Componenti del gioco gradevoli, profondità strategica minima mentre è molto presente la tattica. Seppur divertente secondo me il gioco risulta un po' troppo lungo e questo lo rende ripetitivo. Da provare.

[i]Excellent negotiation game I would love to play again. Probabaly not a game that'd see enough play to warrant owning since we have Lords of Vegas and that only sees the table a few times a year.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A negotiation game with a one minute time limit! This game runs at a brisk pace and adds real tension to the negotiations.
- Great art, and I appreciate how the theme ties in with the mechanisms. 
[i]You are fighting dragons with different characters of varying strength and sometimes special abilities.[/i]
[i]- The magic object cards add some fun special powers into the game, at least for the person playing the card.[/i]
- I appreciate the fact that this game focuses solely on negotiation and nails it, there is zero bloat in this game. 
- All of the above points make this an excellent family game, my daughter loved it.[/i]

Neat negotiation game that's perfect length for what it is. It’s 18 negotiations over the split-ups of cubes. But the 1 minute timer used for each negotiation kept things moving along to the conclusion well enough.

We play the advanced game featuring magic cards (which is just fancy theming for special one-use-only action cards) which suit a game of this light nature. Good for the occasional game.

The game is a good filler, although not definitely a great game to insert into the history of gaming. The trading part is the only original one and can be fun for one games or two, then it doesn't make any more sense: if you don't have any chance to refer to any future exchange, or any other external condition, there are positions in which simply there's no solution. Either both players lose all, and lose the game, or one player wins the most part of the treasure and wins the game. Not very interesting. The colors of the cards are horrible. While dragons and other drawings are completely full of too many colours, the players distinguish themselves by small circles that all look brown/grey, unless they are in direct sun light.

RATING: 7
Can't really decide my reaction towards the game. I'm sure it's not hatred but I'm not sure whether I like this or feel neutral...

The theme is basic: dragon-slaying in a fantasy environment. Mechanics are weird: You kill a dragon - easy. You negotiate upon sharing the loot in one minute - not so easy depending on the players.

Components are good in quality and there comes rather lot in game compared to the prize. I need more plays to make my opinion... 6 or 7...

Negotiation. For cubes, which score points. Yet.. the game takes too long for the lightness of the game. I feel this is a common 'older' game problem. Citadels has the same problem, as does colonists of catan.

This game is so much fun. An excellent game of negotiation (a genre I happen to love). Just remember to remove the magic glove or whatever the spellcard is called that allow a player to steal - It just makes people feel angry and frustrated when they find out about it in the end.

Cute, light negotiation game, with a bit of chaos thrown in. It's hard to get a negotiation game right, and this one works well enough, but since it's just about getting points there's not all that much pressure to get the most out of every deal. It's all a bit same-y. I like [thing=122][/thing] better.

A játék lényege, hogy lovagként, tolvajként és varázslóként kell legyőzni a sárkányt a nála levő kincsért.
Két változat van, az "alapnál" azok között, akik legyőzték a sárkányt a "legkisebb" csinál annyi csomagot, ahányan vannak. A másik verziónál a küzdelemben résztvevőknek egy percük van arra, hogy megegyezzenek. Szerintem a második jobb, izgalmasabb!
Sok féle kincs van, melyek közül van olyan, ami pontot ér, míg másoknál sorozatokat kell létrehozni, így gyüjthetsz több pontot.

Dragon's Gold is a very interesting medium weight game. Although the theme of killing dragons by playing adventurers whose combined strike value should be greater than the dragons' life points is somewhat pasted on, the true meat of the game lies in the negotiation to divide the dragon's treasure. 

If even one party does not agree to the negotiation terms when the timer (1 minute) runs out, the entire treasure is lost! Magic cards add an element of twists to the whole mechanic.

The negotiations can be fairly cut throat and brutal and players must be able to play in the spirit of the game. With the right group, Dragon's Gold is a fantastic game.

I am impressed by game designers that are courageous enough to rely on pure and solid communication to solve in-game issues, especially if the core principle on the game is built upon that very aspect. A cutthroat negotiation game. If the time runs out, nobody gets the loot. This game can really go awkward when played with the wrong people but I do like my games dangerous now and then and it can really spice up and evening of dusty euros.

I really like this game, but it's fiddly. You're always having to move cards, move treasure, move timers. I feel like the game needs a full-time game master to run the game. I spend as much time fiddling with cards and pieces as I do playing, which decreases from the fun factor.

The game plays as advertised.  A wary eye should be dedicated to dragon hunts where an opponent puts the thief and wizard in the battle together, especially those who currently hold the Black Pearl.

Very fun negotiating game.  Sure you can play cards to the middle in the style of BattleLine but can you negotiate for the rewards there instead of just getting them automatically?

Nice negotiation game, which does not overstay its welcomeness. There are some possibilities for tactical play. It gets a bit thinky if you try to remember which colors your opponents gather. It is a fun situation, when the black diamond is in play and the owner must evade the thiefs.

I have played only with 6 people, but I assume with 3 or 4 people it becomes more tactical and also benefitial to sabotage the negotiations by not agreeing (which has not happened in my game).

RATING: 7
Based on one play.   A light and vicious negotiating game--a genre to which I'm quite partial.  It took us an hour to finish a game, but I suspect that once people are more familiar with the game, the pace will speed up to something more appropriate to its weight (30 mins?).  Seems very much like I'm the Boss, but more vicious and more luck.  What makes I'm the Boss special are the strange turns of each deal.  Dragon's Gold lacks this aspect but has instead a stronger tension factor, as you try to beat the clock in making deals, and as you worry about key treasures being stolen or being one-upped by your opponents in critical areas. 

It's also interesting to see how people can judge "fairness" in different ways--like all political issues, the conflict comes from different people perceiving an issue in different ways.  It's hard to have a philosophical discussion of justice and fairness, however, when there's only 30 seconds' worth of sand in the timer!

06-09-2015. Dragon's Gold is a nebulous game for me. I have owned it for the longest time without actually playing it. It was on my list to play in 2014, and I just managed to play it today. Stupid thing, I really like it.. even with just 3.

In Dragon's Gold you have 4 adventurers. You want to get points by getting certain combinations of gems from dragons. You kill dragon's by 'attacking' them with your troops (thief, wizard, two warriors). If multiple players are attacking one dragon, then you negotatie in 1 minute to split the treasure.

Fun game. Nice graphics. Hope my next play won't take a year..

A very fun and fast negotiation game.  The threat of "no one gets anything" looming can make some deals intense and can really be used to your advantage at times or you can just get in on kills to keep opponents off of gems.  The magic cards can be kind of hit or miss, but I'd rather play with them than without them.

Players work together to fight dragons and then divide the dragons loot. Problem is the aid per player is not necessarily even. Players must all come to agreement amongst themselves on who gets what share of the treasure before a timer runs out (started immediately upon slaying the dragon), the catch is that if an agreement cant be reached no one gets any of the treasure. 
Lots of opportunity for king-making and making people mad.

A negotiation game that works...barely.

This game is a mish-mash of mechanics. Players control a team of characters that can kill dragons. Each dragon gives treasure worth different points.

The extra cards range from crappy to powerful. The wooden treasure counters are so tiny and the heart of the game: negotiation is so restricted by time and rules that people end up settling instead of negotiating.

One of those annoying negotiation games, where the enjoyment of it depends on who you are playing with. It's also far too tempting to metagame, which I hate. There is still a bit of a game beyond negotiation, but once you strip away the negotiation, there isn't much of a game. Apparently there's an official variant, which improves the game significantly.

Topic: Players send out adventurers to slay dragons, and then try to share the loot.

Gameplay: Loot sharing has only one rule: If there is no consent after a short time given, nobody gets anything. The game is spiced up with a clever scoring mechanism and different abilies for the adventurers which add stealing and magical abilities (special rule-breaking powers). Fun with a talkative group.

Verdict: Recommended.

Ok this may be the geekiest games around.  Still, it was kind of fun.  I've only played the basic game, I'm sure that with the advanced game this may get up to a 6.5.  We played it a bit incorrectly as there weren't rules for the market.  Now it needs to hit the table again.

Good enough for a light filler, but nothing that is going to blow anyone away.  It is in that strange catagory of game where it wasn't really worth buying, but there is nothing that makes me want to get rid of it either.  I'll play this whenever.  I could see this seeming very systematic after a while though.

Next time I'm totally playing with MAGIC!

This is a nasty, evil, cutthroat game of negotiation.

But for those that enjoy a great time, definitely look it up.  I'm sure it's OOP these days, but it deserves to be in print no doubt.  And I've found that it plays very well between 3-6.  Just definitely play with the advanced rules!

1 play, 3er. Sort of a stock/negotiation game: you invest your 4 cards (1-4) in the 5 dragons, each worth a variable (random) mix of tokens. When you meet the card value, everyone invested has 1 minute to negotiate a split -- otherwise, all tokens are discarded. At end of game, each token is worth different number of points either individually or in sets, or for having the most of the token type; most points wins.

OK game, although you need to be a fan of negotiation. I think I'm the Boss! fans would like this more; just OK for me.

RATING: 7
Has an interesting mechanic of negotiations with a timer.  Pretty easy to learn and definitely some tough decisions, especially which colors to go for and how to handle negotiations with different personalities.  I actually prefer the basic rules without all the extra cards.  Maybe I would enjoy it more if the theme didn't involve dragons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an extremely simple negotiation game.  The game consists of players playing cards depicting different adventurers in turn with values ranging from 1-4 trying to match or exceed the value on 4 dragon cards in the center of the table.  This dragon has a certain number of different colored tokens on it and receives a certain number more when the dragon is defeated.  When it is defeated players have a minute to decide how to divide the tokens among everyone who participated.

At its core this isn't that interesting of a game.  Most of the negotiations end predictably with each player receiving about the same value in tokens and a minute isn't little enough time that players are going to make hasty decisions.

It is made a little more interesting by the magic items and the two special adventurers.  The magic items give players different special abilities, the thief special adventurer steals tokens from opponents, and the wizard special adventurer is needed to obtain magic items.  The two special adventurers can also be used together to choose which token you steal from an opponent.

In the end though this isn't enough to make the game that entertaining of a distraction.

It's fine for a light multiplayer game, but some of the cards are unbalanced and I'm never the one to suggest playing it.  I do think the card that allows stealing from the cards to be a hilarious mechanic.  "You're cheating" - "No, there is actually a card that let's me do this."

Some really great mechanisms.  Like the placement of characters and the economy behind defeating the dragon was super solid.  The mystery treasure found after defeating the dragon was great, too.  But then the entire game must stop on a dime and players have to negotiate who gets what treasure.  Passive players take a back seat and can get bullied, or duped if not paying full attention to whom is hoarding which gem colors.  Good ideas, mediocre execution.  Spell card are cool, but not all are fully thought out.

I like Dragon's Gold, actually, and the negotiation is great - I would, however, recommend that people play only with the advanced rules.  In explaining the game to people, I make sure to warn them of the "Invisible Hand" card, so that people don't leave the game thinking "Soandso was cheating" and not report it because they don't want to make a scene.  This is, however, a game where if even one person doesn't want to continually negotiate, it won't be a very fun game.  They might lose, but no one will have fun in the process.  Avoid it with that crowd - the rating suffers as a result.

I often use a variant where if someone has both a thief [i]and[/i] a wizard on a dragon, instead of looking behind someone's screen and stealing something, they can instead ask for a specific gemstone type/color from another player, and it must be given to them (if the player doesn't have any, another can be requested).  Sometimes the ability to look behind the screen and know exactly what other players have can lead to extra AP on future turns, and on a game like this it just isn't worth it.

The game itself is just okay, though negotiation is not a mechanic I usually enjoy. The negotiation here is pretty simple, though, because you just try to convince your opponents to split up some loot in a way that's favorable to you. You don't actually exchange anything, so this gets rid of the "auctions" that negotiation games can devolve into. The take-that elements really detract from the game. You're trying to collect sets of gems, but there are multiple ways that opponents can steal from you, costing you tons of points if they break up one of your sets.

Played the strategic variant, open money, advanced scoring, no magic items, 5p. Interesting how even the strategic variant has negotiation. In my game the black diamond was acquired early and then that player, able to request only cash out of any loot, won the game.

Not sure why I didn't like this more. The decisions of where/how to allocate your fighters and how to divvy up loot to get a desirable outcome, are interesting. But there didn't seem to be room for e.g. alliances. Almost similar to Bohnanza there, in feel. No IOUs. I guess because it's too unclear how you will be paid back. The guy who owes you one may never find himself in the right position to pay you back.

Pretty neat little filler.  I wasn't entirely sure how I was going to feel about the timed negotiation phase, I do like negotiating but I knew that it could lead to people stone-walling. It actually doesn't come up too often, for the most part people are reasonable, but it does create interesting strategic options jumping in on a dragon at the last minute with minimal investment and saying you want the best gem or no one gets anything.  Of course, now you become the target to get stolen from by those people you burned a bridge with, so it all comes back around.

Plays quick and is easy to teach.  Some fun variability with the magic cards.  Not a great game, but it's good for what it is, feels a bit different and accommodates a lot of players so it's good for that.

I wouldn't pay more than the 20 bucks you can find it for right now as the component quality isn't great, and the artwork is all reused.

RATING: 8
I love games where the social atmosphere becomes intertwined with the game play. Where players make decisions based not only on what's happening right now but how now could potentially affect later. Where you might totally honor your word to another player...until, in a fit of defiance, you don't. Usually when they least expect it.

Also, games where players bicker over piles of plundered loot are often hilarious.

That's basically what Dragon's Gold is: a game where people pretend to be doing you a favor, just as long as it means they're doing better than you are. But with so much treasure and so many sneaky maneuvers, it's tough to tell who's in the lead...and that's what makes this game good. You're second-guessing each play, stealing from the guy who you think has what you're looking for, or trying to throw a wrench into the plans of whoever you think has been getting by on too much kindness.

It takes those kinds of rambunctious and unapologetic players to make Dragon's Gold fun. If everyone is always agreeable and nobody ever challenges the guy who always ends up with the gold nuggets, the game will probably be a bore. You have to be a little bit two-faced in this game, with a smile on your face and a dagger behind your back.

RATING: 6
I enjoy this game. It is a negotiation game, but the rules include variants to remove that aspect. Players take turns playing adventurers to attack dragons and claim there gold. Once a dragon has been slain all of the players who have attacked it have to come to an agreement on how to split the loot. There is a set collection and powers of the adventurers, but those only add variety to the game. My family loves to argue so the negotiation is actually a lot of fun and we did not previously have a game to fill that nitch. 3/3/16

RATING: N/A
Light auction card game for set collection scoring. Dragon cards come out with random amounts of different types of gems. Players choose a dragon to play a hero card. The dragon is defeated when the combined attack value of the heroes is greater. The participating heroes negotiate how to divy the loot. I like the different ways the dragon's horde size is determined. The game gets interesting with the special powers of the wizard to get spells and thief to steal gems from the other players. Market phase adds an interesting Pit style trade of gems to build your sets knowing that you also are helping the other players. The huge pile of different types and colors of plastic gems adds a lot to the spirit of the game; tactile, and visually. Caution! I was told the reprint of the game comes with tokens instead? I need to confirm.

Een spel met twee gezichten. De een simpel en lief, de ander lastig en gemeen.

Spelers bevechten met hun helden de draken uit de titel. Als een draak eenmaal verslagen is laat deze een schat achter. Deze schat moeten de spelers nu onder elkaar verdelen. Hier komt echter de crux. Ze moeten binnen een minuut overeenstemming bereiken over de verdeling anders verliest men de schat sowieso.

Enkel nog gespeeld met de basisregels. Hierin maakte het spel niet echt indruk op me. Het bevechten van de draken is erg simpel, enkel het onderhandelen brengt wat plezier. Misschien dat de gevorderde regels wat meer pit in het spel brengen.

You play a number 1-4 and collectively with other players try to get a sum that meets or exceeds the dragon's health.  Players that play a 1 or a 2 potentially get a slight bonus.  Then players argue about who gets which gems.  Set collection doesn't score enough points, so you really just need to go for one or two colors of gems.

Meh.  Wish the gold and silver pieces were more distinct in this edition.

Gameplay is grossly opportunistic, with players most frequently looking to finish out a dragon-attack to get in on the loot.

The magic items push this into the "want to play again" category, and stealing stuff out from under other players' noses (literally!) is always a good time.

And who doesn't love a negotiation game where everyone can come out a loser?  Breakdowns in communication are always enjoyable, whether as a spectator or a (non)participant.

Play your cards to defeat the dragons and then negotiate with all other players that defeated that dragon for the treasure. You have one minute to decide or it all goes away. I like negotiation games so this is a good one. It is a challenge to come out ahead. The advanced rules should be used.

It is ok game. Idea is fun. But sometimes frustrating for me since some people are irrational about it which makes hard for me to make an agreement about dividing the treasures.

Fun, chaotic game.
No idea about it's lasting appeal though.

great game, except we play with the sandtimer-alternative, where the weakest player divides the treasure, and then the strongest player selects the first.

Dragon's Gold is a great game. Using the advanced rules is the only way to play. I love the negotiation period and am willing to let the loot expire if I can't work a fair deal. The event cards usually spice up the game play. Fun for everyone, ideal game length and always a surprise at the end finding out who is winning. However, we could not distinguish the gold and silver pieces, so spray painted the golds to a different shade of gold. http://i.imgur.com/aXFrfIH.jpg

Very good negotiation game, with the right type of players.  Having more than one bull headed player in a game usually ruins the fun for me though.

The more I play it, the better I like it. Played with a group of negotiaters makes the game vicious and exciting. Some of my (non gamer) friends can take T2R or leave it, but this one they fight to play.

Stumbled upon this negotiation game, on BGG.  Have not been disappointed.  Can be hard to find a copy but I managed to grab a 1st Edition off eBay for like $20, so hard to go wrong with that!  I expect this one to see a lot of play.

Gra negocjacyjna z przedmiotami-ułatwiaczami. Gracze: 3-6 os. Tłumaczenie: dość krótkie. Wymagania: śmiałość w negocjacjach, język polski (w wersji z przedmiotami). Czas: 1/3h + 1/3h per os.

Ciekawe negocjacje na czas, ciekawe przeszkadzajki/ułatwiajki w postaci magicznych przedmiotów. Pomijalny downtime.

Decent little negotiation game that puts a twist on the typical "loot the dragon, split the treasure" genre. Interesting, but a little too "involved" to be a filler.

There are many fun elements to this  game. Adding a few house rules to stop stalemates will make this game a blast.  I'm sure you can think of great punishments to encourage negotiations.

Yeah! Trading under time limit whilst set collecting and screwing over your neighbours. A perfect convention game.

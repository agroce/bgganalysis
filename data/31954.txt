Somewhat more fiddly than AVL, but of the same system. Rulebook/game was not developed as tightly as AVL was either. Still, a decent game that I would be happy to play again, but with owning AVL it seemed unlikely that would happen soon. Hence the 7 score.

This is a really enjoyable game - highly recommended. Rules are straight-forward and elegant, and serve to create a very playable and rewarding game. Lots of tough operational decisions to make, and the game system allows you to focus on these decisions, not the rules. I've played solo, and found it an excellent system.

 Juego interesante y desafiante sobre el avance y la conquista de la Rusia occidental durante la Operación Barbarroja. El juego funciona a base de chits que le dan una cierta incertidumbre que incrementa la tensión a la hora de tomar decisiones. Termina siendo ágil y necesitas adaptarte a situaciones muy cambiantes.

RATING: 8
I love this game. The variety of units makes the game very challenging and the map is designed in such a way that the movement during the first 3 turns will affect the rest of the game. There are several strategies that can be followed: attack from north, centre, or south. The attack from the north seems the easiest one, but if the Germans don't break the line in the south (there is a major river which makes the assaults very difficult) things get complicated later on in the game. I think it's a must to have!

As good as Victory lost, if even better. Supply and reinforcements rules are little better, aswell as command links on activations. 

Great game.

RATING: 6.5
Nice game, but I prefer its sibling, "A Victory Lost".
One important difference between them is that in AVD you can activate HQs inside the command range of the HQ you activated with her chit pull. That makes for many activations per pull, which makes for a less agile game than AVL.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Takes the AVL system and ups the chaos and randomness significantly. Things like reinforcements and supply, artillery etc. are governed by chit draws. When you consider the liberal rules for placement of reinforcements (simply near an HQ, which BTW can also voluntarily relocate) you can see how bizarre this game can get.

Still, it is good fun.

Initial Impression: I'm not a fan of MMP games in general. I find their components unattractive and their rules fairly "old-school". I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The map is beautiful as well as functional and the system is innovative. I enjoy the chit-pull command system and simply love the variable hidden VPs which make every city potentially valuable so neither side knows which ones to protect. The OOS marker system is also incredible. The game works great solo but I'm looking forward to trying it out with an opponent.

RATING: 1
There is so much, so wrong, with this game, I am not sure where to begin, or end.

For starters, the combat factors assigned to the units are so far off base, (in what essentialy should have been a numbers counting exercise), that one steps into the realm of fantasy.

For example, a German Panzer Division, with their two regiments of motorized infantry, and one regiment of tanks, somehow wind up in this game with one third the defensive combat power of a similarly organized Motorized Division of two regiments of motorized infantry, but without the tanks !
In this game, independent infantry regiments, with one battery of Artillery, have one half the combat power of a division of three regiments with all their divisional assets; to include nine batteries of artillery !
Keeping in mind that this Artillery is the primary combat punch of any combined arms team, one begins to appreciate how far off the counting was in this design.
A Soviet Infantry Division can be 50% stronger on the defense than a German Panzer Division.
An independent German Motorized Infantry Regiment is twice as strong on the defense as a German Panzer Division.

Then there is the issue of staying power, or "steps" to elimination. Somehow, in this game, the independent regiments are the equal of a three regiment division, with all the divisions inherent assets.

For the Soviets, T-34s and KV-1s that historicaly only appeared on the battlefield at this stage of the war, in small "penny packets", in this game appear in massed divisional sized elements. Not only did this not happen at this stage of the war, it COULD NOT HAPPEN, as  any person with even a fundamental understanding of the Red Army  at this stage of their development should grasp.

Throughout, the nonsensical rules disfigure any sense of reality.

The Supply Rules, for example, remove all sense of any German Command Authority over unit supply priority. 
The rules, in effect, allows the Soviets to plant their agent in the position of Quartermaster for Army Group Center !

Soviet Air Defense units, although they have no possible affect on air defense, do somehow convey magical abilities on inferior Soviet Infantry to ignore retreat results, (on the CRT), without step losses, while elite German units, known for their tenacity, must in ALL cases obey retreat results without even the option to "stand and die" , taking step losses instead of retreating.

Victory Points, for the German capture of cities & towns, is so random, that it is possable for the Germans to get zero points for the major city of Smolensk, on the main road to Moskow, while a backwater town like Sukinichi could be worth seven; the most that can be awarded. 
Cities like Kaluga and Orel are never worth a single point.
 The Germans can wipe out the entire Red Army, and it is not worth a single victory point !

In the game, Mink, and the vast pocket, fall to the Germans at the end of July.
In fact, Mink had fallen by the end of June, and as for the pocket, which was to the west of the city,(NOT as in the game) 'mopping up' operations had ended on July 9; when the game begins.

One might have thought the research for "Niko's favorite unit" might be correct. However, on August 14, when the Spanish Blue Division arrives in the game, it was in fact still training at Grafenwohr in Bavaria, not even getting to the Vitebsk area till late September.

The original design, A VICTORY LOST, had elements that were slightly flawed, but worked out OK, and was a'lot of fun to play. It was hoped this new game would build on that success.Instead, this game amplifies, and then distorts those minor flaws beyond even the remotely plausable, turning this game into a bizarre caricature of reality.
This game may be the very definition of failure. take a great situation, a great system, and then screwing it all up. It just has way too many things that do not make sense, and are unreal. I kept hoping these things were just a little duct tape and glue to make it work, but in the end, I came to realize the basic structure of the old game was gutted to make room for duct tape and glue, and it does NOT work.

Tengo que probarlo mas la primera partida no me dejo un buen sabor de boca.

El juego es majo, las condiciones de victoria muy tensas y la activacion por chits lo hace muy rapido.

Mi problema es que lo veo muy ajedrecistico para mi gusto. La tabla de combate no hace bajas y la forma optima de derrotar al enemigo es siempre envolver rodear y hacer que retroceda en ZOC. Al final es un juego muy de maniobra y poco azar, igual el sistema no es para mi.

RATING: 5
Wow, this game could really use some sensible supply rules. It's *so* hard to isolate anyone because any snaky LoS is good. My Panzers basically drove around everyone in the way and struck right for Moscow (triple back-to-back initiatives once I rolled a 6 for Hitler's Objective), managing to occupy one hex there and instant-win despite no rational supply path.  It was kinda silly, really. I've tried to like both AVL and AVD, but I just can't do it.
---
"Design for effect" rears its ugly head again in the form of ludicrously low defense values for German Panzer units (typically panzers are 9-2's, or even more insanely extreme 8-1s when reduced) while motorized units are 4-4s or 6-6s. OK, I get it, the panzer divisions were not used defensively in the historical campaign, those duties were handed over to the motorized units. But they didn't perform that role because they were incapable, but rather because they were too valuable. A VP penalty for losing armor steps would have been a much more rational way to do this, as Vance von Borries does in his EFS games. Or maybe the problem is the mobility of the motorized units is too high compared to the panzers. I don't know. But having such low defense values for German (only) armor units would seem to create as many weird problems as it solves.

Anyway, I look forward to giving the game a spin, it looks a good situation and shorter than A Victory Lost, which was fun but too long, and STAVKA created a downtime problem. But the decision to make panzers so defensively weak does not show a lot of design finesse, it's the sledgehammer of a relative amateur, not the work of a pro.

RATING: 6
Slightly worst than A Victory Lost. Both sides are fighting in a "catch and shoot" game. German Panzers are strong in attack, but vulnerable in defense. Soviets relies on almost unlimited reserves and waiting to big push to cut of Germans tanks. Some clever mechanics - different dice for both sides to resolve battles, random VP location, Hitler's decisions which changes our plans, Minsk pocket release table.
One trouble bothers me - following Moscow objective, game loses his "history" path too much. This is not "what-if" situation - it's completely out of thin air idea, where couple of German tanks, with completely unsupported flanks, dash hundreds kilometers to Soviet capital. That's no 1940 campaign in France, it's no "Sichelschnitt".

RATING: 7
Playable and dynamic but I don't like the activation of the HQs. It's enough to keep a chain of connected HQs such way you can move your whole army. It's likely that the Soviet player can activate at least thrice all his units such way to counterattack heavily since the first turns. It's a game and not a simulation but I'd have preferred less mobility

Nice follow-on to A Victory Lost with some very interesting mechanisms. German Panzers can't coordinate quite as well with supporting infantry, but the series continues to put a lot of chrome into the game in ways that don't increase rules complexity (like putting the Germans OoS more frequently until mid-game, when the logistics finally catches up). Excellent solitaire game as well.

I don't see how the Germans can fail to win this. All you need to do is get one panzer to Moscow with any semblance of a supply route. The only way the russians could hope to prevent this is by building a silly wall of troops across the whole front.

Recently played, at last.

Nice map and counters. Fine, not complex hex&counter with chits mechanic. Dynamic and entertaining.

Has some things which can be hard to digest for some wargamers: VP values are only unveiled at the end of the game, magical apparition of elite divisions in the middle of a combat, out of supply chosen by the Soviet Player, too low defense values of some panzer units. I can put up with them but I'd understand some people don't.

Picked this up from a fellow wargamer, and this is a first impression of the game after reading the rules. I have played AVL several times, so have some idea of how the system works.  The HQ activation seems to be an improvement over AVL.  And the magical railing into the enemy rear syndrome seems to have been addressed.

Will review rating once I have a chance to get this onto the table.

RATING: 7
Good: Operational - WW II Eastern Front - easy

Plus:
-Great theme: Guderian, Minsk pocket, Smolensk, Moscow  
-Components, please note they have a sturdy box now
-Tried AVL system base that has undergone an evolution
-Interesting additions (see below).
-All these additions work well
-Skill is important, use your Guderian chit too early to make a push, you find your Panzer Corps being smahshed the next Russian chit....you really have to learn to play well.

Cons:
-Compare dto AVL, the manouvre space is more confined and therefore the options more limited. I personally miss the feel of AVL with Russian units swirbling around and the Germans desperately try to plug the holes. I hoped for a similar approach with some extra chrome but for me the unit density is more of a disadvantage.
-I am not sure about the 2 defence strength Panzer. The designer notes explain why it is done but it is horrible to see such lame duck Panzer defending. 
-Color codes not clear (small issue)

Good game, good system but I personally would have loved to see a game with higher unit density (AVL style) trying to break the Russian lines.

I must say, the rules work very well together, some interesting new twists to a new system:
-Panzer group activation
-Russian HQ activation
-Release of forces from the Minsk Kessel
-Elite troops of unknown quality (chit draw)
-Air / Rocket units
-Hitler Directive table
-Victory point chits

In my first game I appreciated the uncertaintees although the 'out of supply' rule is very frustrating for the Germans. Would have been great to have a tool for the Germans to screw their opponent with a 'Stalin no treat or forced attack' directive :-)

Beware, Germans are more challenging to play, Russians just need to react. Early mistakes can ruin the campaign (quite historic) and as German you should consider each move and action carefully. 

This game really forces you to think ahead 'chess' style. If you don't your grenadiers and panzers are gone before you even see the first sign 'Moscow'. 

Less downtime than AVL, more chrome than AVL but somehow I miss the Russian waves and plugging holes. 

Good design but I willhave to play more to give my final verdict. 

Update:
For some reason I did not get as warm with AVD as I did with AVL.

RATING: 9
If you want an in depth sense of history and a solid grounding in a sense of "commander's chair feel" look elsewhere, EFS or OCS perhaps, you won't find it here, but what you will get is an intriguing game that offers interesting decision making for a small amount of rules, AVD delivers. 

Those familiar with A Victory Lost will have the crux of the game, but you will see new chrome like improved command rules, air power, artillery, different supply system and various other bits of chrome. While on paper many of these changes are quesrionable, in play they seem to resolve easily enough. There are legitimate complaints here about historical oddities and even more about the random VP allocation that is kept blind, but ultimately little of this matters. What results is a game that is simply engaging and enjoyable to play and in many ways superior to its predececessor. 

While A Victory Lost was simpler, it had more counters, more chit activations and it was simply huge. AVD however has less counters, less activations and it was too long for its weight, AVD quicker and less hassle. While time will tell on its replayability, so far so good. Well done Adam.

A slightly less popular "Beer & Pretzel" game than its cousin, "A Victory Lost," this game trades maneuver for a gauntlet of tightly timed victory objectives.

Mine arrived 2009-08-21.

Rating based on only a couple solo learning plays so far; I expect it to go down after a few real plays.  (This is the kind of game which I think won't get played much here--only one scenario, fixed deployment, almost no hidden information--so I should have known better, but I wanted to check it out because I never played AVL.)

[b]Things I like:[/b]
- Having the timing of supply checks, reinforcement entry, etc. determined by chit draw is cool.
- Letting the Soviets choose which German units to put OOS is neat.
- The map looks a lot better (really good) in person than it does in pictures.

[b]Things I'm not sure I like[/b]
- The [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/438189]victory point chit draws[/url].
- At the end of turn 6 (after ~34 activations), you roll to see whether there will be 12 more activations, or 30.  Holy cow, that's a bit of a swing in game length!

[b]Things which definitely bug me[/b] (mostly graphic design affecting playability):
- When 2nd PzGrp units are black on gray, and 3rd PzGrp units are gray on black, either [i]make their command chits match,[/i] or put the unit name -> color scheme on the player aid.  "Which guys are 3rd PzGrp again?  Which PzGrp does Guderian command?"
- The most visually significant thing about infantry units & HQs has no effect other than their entry hex: 3rd PzGrp HQs can command 2nd PzGrp infantry, but 2nd PzGrp infantry (which have the same color pattern as 2nd PzGrp mechanized units) can't be commanded when you draw a 2nd PzGrp chit.  The infantry ought to all be the same color, that color should be different than the PzGrps, and (as mentioned above) that color should match the command chits.
- A Stuka counter gives a 2-column shift; why isn't that printed under the CRT, or "+/- 2" on the counter, or on the player aid?  Same goes for the Timoshenko command chit, which gives a 1-column shift.
- It costs 2 extra MP to enter and exit an enemy ZOC.  Why not put that on the map with the other MP costs, or on the player aid?
- Bridges are so critically important, they should be marked much more clearly on the map.
- You only need 1 color of OOC markers, and that color should be different than units.  (When units are red, red markers blend in.)
- OOS markers should have OOS + Isolated on the other side, so that you don't have stacks of 6 counters.
- You use the Hitler Directive table once per game, and the Supply, Reinforcement, etc. sequences once per turn; but it's the former which is on the player aid, and the latter which are spread out through the rulebook.
- The back page of the rulebook is a grainy picture of some art piece instead of a player aid!!  Come on, guys!

[i]Man[/i] that little stuff bugs me.

RATING: 9
A Victory Denied covers the Battle of Smolensk 1941. Both sides engaged their elite units, the German 2nd and 3rd Panzers, 9th Army and the Soviet Corps of the 13th Army, Elite and "Protivovozdushnoy" (POV) Divisions, right before the city of Moscow, in a gigantic engagement to bring decisive result to the campaign. 

The random command chits drawing determine the tempo and strategies in the course of the war, and as the sequence of play is actually randomnized by the drawing chits of supply and reinforcement phase, rendering no two games play the same, and thus no game plan should survive when the next chit is drawn. The Timoshenko reinforcement (arriving on turn one) with his superior attack capability (with one beneficial shift on CRT during attack) and Guderian's higher flexibility in command over 2nd Panzer Group (his command chit can be activated any time after drawing any command chit from the cup, i.e. trumping any command chit) are also featured. German units in Minsk Pocket can arrive at the battle earlier at the risk of escaping Soviet units from the pocket, subjecting the German units to heavier fire combat DR+1 temporarily until the next reinforcement chit. A VP chit is also taken from the German Victory Chit Box but if there is none, the Soviet immediately win. It means that the German cannot release any units from the pocket prematurely without taking at least one victory city hex first.

I quite like the unit differentiation between the mechanized and non-mechanized units in the game. Mechanized units have both attack and defense strength while the non-motorized/ mechanized units have a single combat factor only. Naturally, the former would have higher attack value than the defense. Units are also identified by colors with different command activations when the corresponding command chit is drawn. But the scheme of colors for the two German Panzer Corps has been subject to constant criticism because of non-indistinguishable between the two.

A unit can be activated when it is in command of its HQ within HQ's command range, counted in number of hexes. Nothing can interdict such command range, not even unbridged major river. The German panzer units are activated as long as they are within three hexes to each other. German non-motorized units can only be activated when the 9th Army command chit is drawn and within command range of an HQ. The Soviet units, on the other hand, are activated when they are within the command range of the HQs. An HQ can also be activated by another HQ within its command range. As the Soviet units are not required to be within specific HQ's command range for activation, and they can be activated any number of times in any one turn, they can be congregated in one giant force for movement and attack.

A unit can be in a state of full effectiveness, out of command, out of supply (only attack value halved) or isolated (both attack and defense value halved). The status of individual units on the map tax the players' strength and intelligence in operational planning and execution. The gameplay becomes more interesting and lengthens its life with variable victory points for capture of the cities. The Hitler Directive Table comes in turn 6 to determine if the Fuhrer is going to be distracted from capturing Moscow by other war objective going on elsewhere, historically to the south. There is a possibility that four German motorized units (meaning Panzer corps) when Hitler is distracted.

Aside from the normal cumulative terrain shifts, German Stuka can shift two columns for German attack or defense. Attack below 1:1 is not possible and the maximum odds is 10:1. The attacker rolls a die but it is interesting to note the German rolls a six-sided die while the Soviet rolls a ten-sided die. A roll of 10 would add one Soviet elite unit to the combat, subject to Soviet stacking limit of two units, and recalculate odds. More variability is therefore expected of the Soviet. Majority of the combat results are number of step losses, ranging from one to four. Retreat results are one or two hexes.

Overall, a highly playable and very alluringly terse wargame. It should be one of my top ten game in 2014. I love it.

I mildly disliked AVL, but this game seems to go one step further for me. I just don't seem to be able to like this system or make the game work as history. I gave it a second chance, but it will be my last try. The Combat values given to some units are ludicrous. Stay away from it if you know about the battle; if not, then it still a very fun game, but don't expect to learn anything "real" from it. BTW the map is really nice, and the HQ counters too. Tere is just "something missing" here.  My Rating: 4. Sorry. :-(

Played our first game this weekend and really liked it. I'll be playing more solo. Cool, easy game.

2nd play solo: This seems like a easy win for the Germans out of the gate, but they'll get bogged down and Russian reinforcements bulk up soon. I think the Russians have the edge. Germans will find it difficult to win unless they take Moscow or pile up 'star points'.

I'll probably play this 2 more times before I'm ready to trade..

This is a quickly paced, exciting war game based on the eastern front.

The chit-pull mechanic can make every turn nail-biting, not knowing who will get to go and when, or what else will happen and in what order. The rules are complex war rule but are easy to pick up (relative to other war games) so this makes this game a great entry into the big war games.

Unit balance seems good, unit density is low, chart referencing is minimum, and the components are easy to identify, all this keeps the game moving rather quickly.

Plus it plays well solitaire.

Much faster to play than AVL, but with many of the same choices that need to be made each turn, especially selecting the command chits.  I agree with some of the comments about the colors of the various German units causing some confusion, but that's pretty much my biggest gripe about the game.  After a half dozen plays the game seems to be well balanced with plenty of options for both sides.

Not my favourite period or theatre but this is a pretty simple, playable game. Good fun and nicely presented although not sure how much fun the Russian has (I played the Germans). That's a problem with any game early on the EastFront I suppose.

Not as good as a Victory Lost as the Russian defends quite all the game.

I've only been able to play this twice (one solo play, one face to face where I won as the Germans), but MAN do I want to play this again. The fight between surrounding your enemy (and trying to remain uncircled) is a blast, and it's all too easy to forget the main objective (Minsk for the Russians, Moscow for the Germans) in all the delicious combat going on.

I played as the Germans (my opponent will only play Russians in eastern front wargames), and loved swatting down his turn with a "Nope, Guderian" and use the Guderian counter. This probably backfired, however - after winning the game, he doesn't want to play it again. He's been coming around the past couple of weeks though - maybe tomorrow.

A very good game. I don't like it as much as A Victory Lost. The games are in the same family but A Victory Denied is a totally different game. There is a lot more randomness in AVD due to the extra chits contained in the game for reinforcements, supply, artillery, air, etc.. Rules could use a good rewrite to clarify some of the aspects of the game which seem to cause a lot of confusion among players.

Quite a bit of detail, but not as difficult for those, like me, who have owned or played "A Victory Lost". Either way, a careful reading of the rulebook should make things, on the whole, clear about how to play.

An attractive 4-color, 16-page rulebook actually has about 7 1/4 pages of rules, albeit in small serif type, but with about 5 pages of large 4-color illustrations that include description captions. And, rule flow and explanations are pretty clear. There also is one page of designer notes. Proofreaders hardly missed any typos up to page 11, but apparently didn't check the final version of "Reinforcement Unit Placement", as several errors were missed in that long section; maybe it was the last one added to what became the final version. Regardless, just a few blips on what is otherwise a pretty clear rulebook.

Purchased new at GenCon 2014.

Simple, elegant and eminently playable game. Game length is really spot on, a lot more reasonable than AVL. The map and counters are very attractive. 

My main gripe with it, is that it feels a bit artificial to me for some reason. It is really design for effect pushed to the limit. You can tell the designer has fiddled with it a lot to get the result he wanted which is not a bad thing in itself but I agree with the comment about it being a tad too scripted. The counter density is maybe slightly too low as well, it makes the game plays fast but the low number of units in addition to the fact that there is a lot less rivers than in AVL makes it so there is less incentive to form a front line. I realize this part of Barbarossa was very fluid and it took some time for the infantry to catch up with the panzer spearheads, this part is depicted very well in the game, but it feels a bit odd to have so many gaping holes and empty areas in the front.

This probably sounds a bit too harsh because it is definitely a great game, I have played it 5 times in 3 weeks so it can't be all that bad and I have had a lot of fun with it exploring the strategies involved.

RATING: 9
A few fiddly issues with rules presentation, although everything is there in the end.  Other than that this is a nearly flawless game.  Steep Russian learning curve, but a difficult game for both sides.  Ultimate "play the game, not the rules" type of game.  

Probably more historically accurate than any other game on this subject, although perhaps it is equalled by the B:AGC Smolensk scenario in EFS.  

Fun to play.  Recommended.

I really want to like this game, but I can’t.

The command and control rules are just ludicrous, especially for the Germans.  It is obvious that the designers have no clue about the degree to which German units at every level took initiative and action on their own authority.   It reflects a serious misunderstanding of this campaign in particular, which was to a considerable degree exactly about this phenomenon (Guderian constantly exceeding his orders in pursuit of the main chance just being the most obvious example). 

An example is that ALL infantry units are considered to belong to the 9th Army for command activation purposes.  But historically most of these infantry divisions were actually integrated into the Panzer Groups, and were under their direct command.  So you can end up with infantry units literally sitting next to their own (historical) HQ, but if the 9th Army (unhistorical) HQ is unable to activate them --- well then they just sit in camp and watch the panzers roll on out to fight on their own.  Even short of this extreme, it is just bizarre not to be able to freely handle Panzer Groups as formations with unified commands overseeing different unit types. It's called combined arms.

The random allocation of VPs to various cities also reflects a lack of concern about the historical backdrop.  The goal of the actual campaign was to seize the space between Minsk and Moscow (if not take the city itself) before winter.  Given that, whether the Germans capture this or that town along the way is a trifle.  To randomly assign large amounts of VPs to what are operationally meaningless locations in an operational-level game is simply poor game design.

Other comments have pointed out the basic errors in OOB, the weirdly weak-on-defense panzer units, confusing color choices for counters, and the miraculous appearance of thousands of advanced Soviet tanks that did not yet exist in such numbers or in such large independent units.  I wish I had heeded their comments before buying this game, because all of this taken together represents a basic lack of understanding by the designer of this campaign.

The upside:
-A simple approach to several wargaming concepts. A great second step for beginners.
-The chit-pull mechanism is really great for solo generals. It helps with that "make my best of my play" for both sides.
-Asymetric challenges for german and russian player.

The downside:
-Only one scenario.

Plays well (in spite of a few cumbersome exceptions in the rules).

Yet, questionable whether the whole dynamics are dependable. Simple supply rules allows for the German to rush to Moscow; infantry can move faster than panzers along roads; etc. I say "questionable" for more experience with the game may leads to more inspired play.

My very subjective comments:
Pros:
- easy to learn, even for beginners
- fast setup
- great solitaire play
- unpredictible because of various variables
- fantastic graphics, the map is gorgeous. At first I didn't like the counter art, but once on the map it looks good
- both sides can win. After 2 plays the score is 1:1
- elegant supply design (means fast and easy while getting the point)
Cons:
- the 2nd and 3rd PzGroup counters: the chosen way to distinguish them is not optimal (IMHO)
- some fiddling with the activation rules/chits (maybe just me)
- the german holding boxes should have been on the left side of the map and the soviet boxes on the right
- 1st turn special rules (I hate these special rules that are so over-important! You miss one point and the whole game is flawed!)

The Cons are only minor, but I had to point them out.

This is an overall excellent game. 
GAME, for the guy who gave AVD a rating of 1. If I want a simulation I break out an OCS game. 
Ok, I may be biased because Panzergruppe Guderian by SPI was my first wargame. ;-)
This is one of the few games that went straight from the post office to my gaming table and got two plays in a row and I love it.

So fun. gets out of its own way, rules wise, to allow for some real interesting strategic positioning, and in a playable timeframe too (~4h after initial play). Can't speak to the historicity, as I don't really care about WWII and don't know anything about this conflict. I just know this is a great game. If I keep playing this game, though, I may just pick up a book on the subject, to understand the game better.

Never got around to playing this. Over the years, my war-gaming tastes have evolved to include the desire for high-quality game components (including mounted maps). Component quality for this game was on the lower end of the spectrum in this regard. 

After about a year of sitting on the shelf, the competition was too high -- I owned too many GMT deluxe edition games (or other games of similar quality) and I was never motivated to try it out.

Sold my copy.

I fear that the changes made in AVL basic rules are generally negative.
The system does not suit well to the scenario, as the lack of supply rules and the new Panzer Group mechanism produce weird situations (i.e. 1 Panzer division far ahead of the other ones, that won't move for the entire game). In the end you will see plenty of infantry units in the rearguard of the german spearheads, not because they are fighting, but because both players are spending available chits in other zones, and it is almost impossible to create pockets due to supply rules.

Other problems are the low defence ratings of Panzer units, that simply do not make sense, and the choice of colours for formations, specially the 2nd and 3rd PzGrp.

It is easy to understand why the battle of Smolensk was chosen after AVL. One side has a strong attack and the other counterattacks. Unfortunately I felt that while the initial turns were interesting, the rest was more of a slugfest. There are some minor improvements over AVL, but there could have been more. A Stavka chit for the Germans for example. The odd thing is that because of the rule that HQs activates other units, the Soviets have a lot more commands than the Germans, even if it is hard to use them for effect. 

The out of supply, reinforcement, air support and artillery chits feels unnecessary. And some of the German activation rules are confusing at first. Simply put, for such a relatively simple game, the rules are convoluted.

This is certainly not a bad game at all. It is just not very interesting to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Only played solo but while its not an accurate simulation  what happens makes sense. Its not a particularly brutal game as the usual result for a battle is retreat rather than destruction unless you use Blitzkrieg tactics of exploiting a weak spot, surrounding your enemies, cutting their supplies and then, once isolated, destroying them. 

Then there's the(almost) endless Russian reinforcements, the higher quality but fewer and hard to replace German units. Managing your limited airstrikes and supply lines. Its all handled very simply.

I can't help but feel the manual could of been a little clearer. It was the only major hurdle and I still wasn't sure I had some basic concepts down right until near the end of my first game which considering there's only the one scenario isn't necessarily good.

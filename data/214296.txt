Excellent production, lovely presentation, and an interesting design which plays very smoothly.

At its heart it's a sort of chit pull Musket and Pike. Small groups of units (clans) have one of four orders (attack, defend, manoeuvre, regroup) which tightly constrain what they can do. Chit draws tell you which of the four orders are being carried out that impulse. 

Command points allow you to throw chits for your clans into the cup for the turn for extra actions and to try and change their orders.

It's fluent and easy. Combat is unusual, but again becomes easy to manage. It also seems to feature quite a punishing death spiral which seems extremely plausible, and very fitting.

All in all, a convincing package.

This game brought me back to tactical gamescale I left years ago for operational and strategic scales. 

The battle plan is IMHO a terrific idea. Played several times Nagakute which is a balanced scenario with high replayability.

Tenkatoitsu features some of the finest art and graphic design that I've ever seen in a wargame. The overall effect helps to immerse the players in the atmosphere of Sengoku era Japan. However, there are a couple of practical problems with the graphic design - movement and combat modifiers are determined by hexsides rather than the hexes, and the hexsides are not always clear - the thin, light blue lines representing impassable hexsides can easily be overlooked and quite a large number of hexsides are virtually invisible on the Sekigahara map (black lines against a slightly darker black for the mountain hexes). 

Some of game mechanics were partially or completely new to me, but the rulebook does a reasonably good job of explaining them (in a couple of cases, two or three read throughs were needed to understand them). I don't know a great deal about late 15th/early 16th century warfare in Japan, but the game mechanics give a very distinctive atmosphere to the game. The battle plans and tactics are particularly interesting. Combat is relatively straightforward, though the presentation of the various combat modifiers on the player aid makes it seem more complex than it actually is. However, this is a chit pull system, and comes with the drawbacks inherent in that. Personally, I find drawing chits from a cup or mug that you supply yourself to detract from the otherwise excellent aesthetics of the game. More importantly, the randomness of the chit pull has a significant, if not determining, impact on the game. It feels to me as though you are often a hostage to the order of the chit pulls. The rules around what clans with a particular order can do, also limits the involvement of players in determining what happens on the ground - apart from clans with a Move order, it seems that there is little that players can do to influence things. Some notes from the designer about how to play the game and/or descriptions about related aspects of warfare from this period (such as the battle plans) would have helped, as the rules do hint at some subtleties around moving individual units and the combat system that might provide players with more control. At the moment, how to engage effectively in combat eludes me - I have no idea what the red and blue dice and accompanying combat table actually represents, nor why firepower only has an effect in very restricted circumstances.  

So far, I have only played the Nagakute scenario. It felt very different to playing a similarly-sized battle from Ben Hull's Musket & Pike series. Overall, playing Tenkatoitsu falls somewhere between playing a medieval European battle and one from the 17th century, though perhaps it is a little close to the former due to the relative lack of player control. I'm wondering if, perhaps, Tenkatoitsu plays better as a solitaire than a competitive 2-player game.

Really plush second outing for the Sengoku Jidai series. If it were simply Kawanakajima 1561 #2, it would've been golden; but instead we're treated to three new scenarios, excellent presentation values, and the designer has clearly tried to address a lot of issues with the original game. For example, each instance of combat can still have an exhausting amount of modifiers to apply, but terrain is now more clearly defined.

The already solid base mechanics of the series are further supplemented by some very nice additions, such as the betrayal tracks for Sekigahara, and a lot of just plain neat attention to detail (for example, from that same scenario, Naomasa Ii's charge and Tokugawa firing on Kobayakawa's camp).

I've still only played through one scenario once, but this looks a very impressive improvement on an already excellent system.

RATING: N/A
A fairly innovative tactical wargame that struggles between two concepts: chaos and control.

The chaos is mainly represented with two mechanisms: 1- the chit draw for the activation of your Clans that adds uncertainly and randomness about which of your Clans can operate; and 2- how your Clans units operates with that orders. 
On the other hand, the "control" comes with Battle Plans and the Iniciative Phase where you can choose one Clan to change his order.

In this struggle within your Clans, add some human rival that has the same problems of chaos and control in his side, and you'll get a fantastical experience of what was the battlefield in feudalism Japan.

The game is really fastpaced once you get all the nuances of the rulebook, but my only gripe with it it's the combat system with all the DRM calculations; it gave me some headaches, and still after some plays I feel that counting all the DRM slows a bit the pace of the game.

In any case, a truly fantastic game and I'm looking forward for the next game in the series.

This is an amazing game. The artwork is great, components high quality and the overall system really fun.
It's the first game I ever played that really evolves that much around the concept of friction. It's not about luck, it's really about making the right choices in a constantly & rapidly evolving situation. 
The only drawback for me would be that the drm calculation are a bit tedious, but I guess that if played enough it becomes an automatism.

A great game. 

Very clever activation and order mechanism. Very streamlined combat system with some tactical nuance generating a great range of result. Outstanding battle plan mechanism. Far above any other game I played in the ancient/medieval era. "How could I adapt these features to GBoH" was the question that occupied my mind before and after each play.

As the developper of this game, I will not give it any rating. Just let me tell you that it is part of my top 3 game system with ASL and BAR (CoA).
I really love it !

Surprisingly elegant and simple. I was reluctant to try a chit-based war-game, as it's just never appealed to me as a long-time Warhammer 40K player. However, after playing Battle for Rokugan and loving that token-based game, and with enough people recommending Tenkatoitsu to me as a good entry-level war-game, I decided to give it a shot... and I'm very glad I did. Outstanding game! If you like this game and the samurai theme, I'd also recommend Sekigahara.

Why not a kickstarter backup for other Sengoku Jidai battles? Hoping and waiting new titles and also a reprint of Kawanakajima !

My 10 involves also 5 year participation in building this game, visiting the battlefields and searching for documentation in books and internet.
But the game is really great, very simple mechanics once you have practiced them, great counters, map and also rule book.
The 3 battles have each a unique experience with very different starting situations and specific rules.

A nice depiction of the chaos of a battle, and a wargame that provides lots of options for the players. Having to decide between long term plans and short term activations gives it a nice depth. Solo friendly due to the chit system.

Amazing game. Lots of flavor, fast pace, plenty of fresh ideas, lots of decissions to make, superb art, and excellent solitaire suitability. The combat system may seem a bit cumbersome at first, but after a while you get used to attacker and defender stances and don't even need to look up the combat modifiers table. A gem in my collection.

This is an excellent wargame with a very innovative and fun system. Luck plays its part but doesn't have the upper hand in the game. Your strategy needs to be adapted to unlucky events but in the end the fate of the battle will be in your hands. This game is also very good to play solo. Now to the Cons: The rulebook is a mess with many mistakes in the translation from French to English (even for a non-English speaker like me) and with many gaps (situations in which you don't know what to do). The combat system is a little bit cumbersome at first but then you get used to it. Lastly, there are no designer notes and it is a shame considering the beauty of this superb game.

Addendum: The designer is very supportive and responsive. If you have got any questions on the rules post them on the Forum and Francois will reply shortly.

Years ago I was introduced to "Kawanakajima 1561" by a friend. I was really impressed by clan order mechanic and the effect it had on structure of a game turn. I am also partial to good looking games. "Tenkatoitsu" is a better title than "Kawanakajima", some things are streamlined or the rulebook better organized... I cannot put it down to a single reason. I still enjoy very much a certain dose of inertia that this system provides. The game encourages long-term thinking (selection of battle plans and tactics, a dreadful responsibility for any beginner, I would say) and there is just enough variations in each scenario to keep me interested.

Chit pull mechanic also makes it much easier for me to play it solo. The uncertainty of a pull along with choices available add to that s well.

The game is a "looker", it is also certainly a "keeper", too. Thanks, my friend!

Good times.

Really looking forward to my next game of this. Any wargame that gets me pondering on strategies and gameplay when I am not playing is great in my book.

I mostly played Anegawa (the next, yet unpublished volume in the series). The order system is a variant of Rob Markham/Musket and Pike  with sticky, constraining orders plus a twist (pre-battle planning). Combat resolution is relatively elegant (a simple table but with modifiers depending on the situation). Overall, feels very good.

Interesting use of clans and activation.  Setting battle plans prior to the scenario seems thematic to the warfare of the period.

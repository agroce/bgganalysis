Silly fun game, who is going be the most successful souvlaki restaurant owner? Big moustaches win here. It might drag a bit longer than you want for a lighthearted game but it will make you laugh.

RATING: 6.5
Funny theme, nice idea, the cards incorporate many scenes from real daily orders in the life of greeks!

Played it with 2, 3 and 4 players, works like a charm every time if you want something simple yet funny with your group of friends.

Simple to learn and play.

I guess I gave it an extra point for the theme wich you have to be greek to appreciate! 
I find the mechanics to be very clunky (the card drafting mainly). It's fun the first time I introduce it to new players but almost noone wants to have another go at it.
Plus... I'm on a diet :p

PS. The guys went on to make far better games!!!

Nice light card game but takes longer than the 30 minutes as stated on the box. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is probably one of the best filler games I've tried so far! It plays in around 30 minutes or so and it's just enjoyable to play. 

For what it is, I think I get a decent amount of options to cope with each round and there is actually a little "meat" to the game; which customers to choose, how to feed them and which unforeseen event cards to play. It might take a little while when players are calculating what to do, but it isn't that bad. However, you need to recalculate everything again when the other players are playing event cards which screw your plans over big time!

I dig the event cards even though they aren't all that good; they are perhaps a little imbalanced, but hey, it's a short card filler game, so it's okay! The event cards can be reeeeally mean and can hurt your plans and make the game a little unpredictable, but I like that kind of "take that!" games.

Finally, I think it's a good idea with the 4 different souvlaki chains the players can choose from, and even though the blue seems best, our first 3 games ended with 3 different winners so it probably is balanced somewhat. Future plays has seen the blue player win more often, probably because he can choose customers first because he has the highest reputation.

Overall, this is a game I can highly recommend to both gamers and non-gamers. A true filler gem!

Played a game that was cut short, but it was fun. Rating should go up after a full play.

Played it a 2-player game. It falls a bit flat, but still somewhat enjoyable. Not many meaningful choices, but still not entirely random. Might need some houseruling. At least it's a game I can play with my parents.

RATING: N/A
I'm writing this comment three years after I played the game last, and my memory of the game is rather hazy as a consequence. Reading through the rules I vaguely recall the idea of customer line management, and thinking it all a bit overwrought. Owing to the location shutting down for the night we had to break off our game, but I still see the game's owner from time to time, so perhaps there will be a rematch at some point in the future.

RATING: 7
Souvlaki is a subject that, being Greek, I love to talk about. But a game about our traditional food will only interest us, I know that. We bought it as an inside joke, to play with our non Greek friends, but actually it's a pretty interesting game. The mechanisms are solid and they work perfectly with the way a real restaurant owner would run the four stereotypical food chains (you have the expensive and luxurious and the cheap but pretty unsanitary) competing for customers and money. Great little game.

RATING: 5
I don't know why I'm disappointed by this - it's exactly what you expect from the description: a light, mildly entertaining logistical exercise that doesn't have enough risk-taking or tough choices to make it particularly interesting. Hopefully nobody in your group plays this type of game in "epic" mode. The variable player "powers" (parameters, more like) don't bring with them any different [i]strategies[/i], so I see them only as a source of contention -- for example, if you married someone who insists on only ever playing Blue. I'm not sure that the game is long enough to make up for the different starting points. 

The bowbing cards add a layer of intrigue -- some chaos is welcome, some uncertainty as to how many orders you're going to be able to fill. But, they vary too much in potency, and, especially in a three-player game, add too much kingmaker potential (or, double-teaming on Dad potential). I'm thinking about replacing them with some random effects that would not be directed at a specific player. Not enough skill; you'll never hear "oh, that guy is really good at Souvlaki Wars".

ΘΕΤΙΚΑ
Πολύ καλή τιμή (15ευρώ). Ευκολοι κανόνες. Πολυ γρήγορες παρτίδες. Κατάλληλο για παιδιά που δεν ασχολούνται με τα επιτραπέζια, θα το λατρέψουν σίγουρα. Ωραίο artwork με πετυχημένο το θέμα σε κάθε κάρτα.

ΑΡΝΗΤΙΚΑ
Δεν βρισκω τα μαγαζιά ισορροπημένα. To Λε Σοθβλας είναι σπασμένο είδικά με 2 παίκτες. Δεν εχει βάθος αν ψαχνεται για κατι σε σοβαρό. Επαναλαμβανομενο χωρίς πολλές στρατηγικες (πας για φημη μέχρι να πιασεις τα 25 και μετα για χρήματα), επιλέγεις τον πελάτη με τα καλύτερα στατιστικά που μπορείς να εξυπηρετήσεις και απο κει και πέρα στην τύχη. Επίσης τελειώνει πάρα πολύ γρήγορα για τα γούστα μου.

Συμπαθητικό fillerακι. Θα το παίξω μόνο αν το θέλει πολύ η παρέα και δεν μπορέσω να τους πείσω για κάτι άλλο.

Home Rule: 
1.Παιζεις οσες κάρτες Απρόβλεπτων Παραγόντων θέλεις, οχι μόνο μία.
2. Δεν παίζει πρώτος όποιος έχει την περισσότερη φήμη αλλά αλλάζει σε κάθε γύρο και πάει δεξιόστροφα. Ετσι ακόμα και ένας που είναι μπροστά μπορεί να επιλέξει σε έναν γύρο πρώτος.

This is a game based on the world-famous greek food "souvlaki" and in my opinion, it's more suited to men rather than women; a fact due to the theme. It's a "light" game, quite tense if you play with other competitive players.

Score based on the principles/rules of the game. It all works very well en looks good.
But players need too much time to see what they want to do, how they will arrange the orders, what they will play as unforseen event,... And that makes the game too slow for what it is.

An honest game. It delivers what it promises and it is more than enough for its price. Great entry game, great filler with one exception. You should never try to fill the time you are waiting for a fast food delivery! Even more you should not try it unprepared and with an empty stomach. I have yet to play this game without making me feel the need to eat some souvlakis!

Not a game you want to be in the lead until the end. If you are you're going to get whacked big time. Along the way there's a bunch of interaction, a few laughs and greasy food.

This will appeal to some.

Talk about immersion...it's productions like this that make you realize just what theme can do for a game. Enhanced by eye candy artwork, the theme just oozes out of this baby like grease out of a McDonald's french fry.

 Now, I can't say for sure if I were to have a line of wizards or cars or something else in front of me ( rather than these stunning caricatures ) that I'd like the game so much less.  But I'd be willing to bet it would be an average experience, instead of the high level of fun that emerges with every play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Excellent theme and art. Card Management and minor bluffing are the main mechanics. 

The game is too chaotic for my taste. The uneven supply cards are the main problem., and event cards make matters worse.

I'd play this again happily with the right group. The theme works miracles for me.

In Souvlaki Wars, players are owners of Greek restaurants serving traditional greek fast food like "souvlaki" and "gyros". They try to attract new customers, making sure they can serve them in time, increasing their fortune and fame at the same time.

Of course, this is easier said than done as many things can go wrong while trying to serve a customer: People change their minds, orders go wrong and restaurant owners try to sabotage each other.

Can you become the most successful Greek restaurant owner?

Souvlaki Wars is a light family card game for 2-4 players. Players draft new customers and try to serve them with food cards they draw at the beginning of each turn. This way they earn the money and the reputation each customer represents. However, before they have a chance to do so, cards with "Unforeseen Events" are played by every player, affecting the game in many different ways like altering the order in lines, adding more customers, decreasing the opponent's reputation etc. And of course, each player has to take into consideration that the customers are served on a first-come basis. If someone's order can't be fulfilled, everyone behind him will have to wait another turn...

The first player to reach a certain level of money and reputation is declared the winner.

The game is going to be published by the Greek company "Kaissa Chess & Games" during 2011. It is going to be bilingual, having text both in Greek and English. Its international debut will be at the 2011 Spiel Essen fair.

This is a fun and nasty little game, which features card drafting, hand management and a big take-that element. The theme is great, and the art work enhances the fun of the game. I really enjoyed the players' asymmetric starting restaurants.

I have now played it without the Unforeseen Event cards, in a game with a child without good enough English skills, and that basically takes away the take-that element and makes the game a good family game.

I really enjoy it, and want to explore it further.

There are a few things that keep it from an 8 for me. First of all you have to really juggle your food cards in order to figure out how to best serve your customers, but this could be easily helped by adding another component, like glass beads or cubes, to track which customers you have served what items of food, and what food items you have remaining on your food cards.

Another is that when you play with the Unforeseen Event cards, they are played in order from best Reputation to worst, and waiting around for people to decide what to do, can be slightly annoying.

It's a solid 7.

RATING: 6.8
When playing with the basic rules, there is no war going on in this game. Then it’s just a nice pick up and deliver game. But when you play with the advanced rules, then you have to use the ‘unforeseen events’ cards. Together with them, you’ll add interaction and frustration into the game, as most of the ‘unforeseen cards’ will give something bad to other players. Play with the advanced rules and you’ll have a very nice game. The artwork on the cards is just fantastic. Every card in this game is unique.

Shelf wear abounds on this box...sides, edges, and corners.  A slight dish of the lid, but no split corners.  Inside the game is COMPLETE.  From how many score cards had been used and the use of the double set of defense cards, this game has obviously been well-loved, but could still be played today.  The football, 10-yard marker, and all charts and rule set are present.  Nothing is ruined, just used.

very fun and interesting. easy to lurn rules .strategy and intuition .could be easily adapted and improved  with variant particularly on all star replay magazine yahoo group but the BEST variant is an article of jim burnett "kick off" which is in "the general"(old avalon hill magazine)volume 25 number 2 : with new chart for punt,punt return,kick off,field goal,time......sadly too long for me 2h30 to 3 hours

RATING: 7
What a fun game!  Although the rules and plays are a little outdated (field goals in the 30-50 yard range are almost impossible!), it's still very entetaining.  I also really like how simple and unfiddly it is.  These sports games can very easily get weighed down by tons of dice throws and table lookups... nice to see such simplicity in this one.  This game's a touchdown.

RATING: 7
The game is dated, the options are limited and it lacks any historical connection. Aside from that, it is a fine playable game that has a more than passing resemblance to the way football was played in about 1960. It would be an interesting project to update this game to the age of the West Coast Offense.

The tenseness that this game produces using such a simple system is amazing, especially considering how old the game is.  For anyone who thinks this is just guessing game, explain why the same people always do well at the WBC competition.

RATING: 6
Players represent two teams playing American football.  Simple game of rock/paper/scissors like divination, as one team on defence lays down one of ten formation cards, then the other team on offence calls one of 22 plays.  The play and formation are cross referenced and a result is read off a matrix.  Typically it's yardage gained or lost, but fumbles, interceptions, penalties, and so on can all come up.  Once you're up to speed with the mechanics and recording the game clock correctly, it plays cleanly and quickly.  I think I almost prefer this to 1st & Goal - it seems much faster to play.

I might have played this game more than any other game I owned.  I was a kid when it was given to me, and I bet I played it 100 times or more, either by myself or anyone else who unwittingly walked into my room!  Not to complex, but fun for a kid.

I found the old version of this (with the scoreboard) at a Goodwill. What a nice find! Really has the football strategy feel to me. You call the plays and find the results. Defense can be tough. There's not much too it really, but it works pretty well for me. Not a classic, but a fun time if you like the guessing and strategy of football and don't want to move a million pieces around or deal with individual stats. This is a good overview game. 

I thought my dad and I might give it a go sometime. :)

RATING: 8
Played this a lot as a kid with my uncles.  Clearly the game of football has evolved since 1959 (primarily seen in the field goal kicker's accuracy chart), the onside kick chart is too forgiving to the kicker, and punting can be frustrating . . . but I've never regretted playing this game.  It's just as much a game against another player as it is one against yourself.

While football strategy probably gets some sentimental help on its rating, I still find it to be a very interesting game to play, and a fun one, too.

I've heard that it's cousin--Baseball Strategy--has held up much better over time.  Having played it once or twice I concur.

Great memories of this one.  Strangely enough, I won most often when I used a scripted play-calling scheme, like Bill Walsh would do.  My main opponent in the past could read my mind, so I did best when I wasn't making any decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
A generalized strategy game of competition between two exactly equal teams.  This means a player's coaching decisions account for success.  Nevertheless, there is a minor luck element and I find big plays come up far too often.

Seems to have more strategic variety than Avalon Hill's Baseball Strategy.

A simple simulation of the play-calling aspect of football.  It plays cleanly as a game and is particularly fun if you're really into football.  It can be quite instructional and even does a reasonable job of modeling the use of the play clock.  The down side is that the play selections are stuck in the 50's pro game (which wasn't bad, by the way), and if you take away the names of the plays and the football imagery, all you're really doing is guessing against an opponent on a 25x10 matrix.

A real battle of wits as a 2-player game. Even using very well thought-out solitaire rules and charts, it doesn't work as a solitaire game, as the playcalling, even within predictable down/yardage situations, is too random to be satisfying. But find somebody who knows football or can understand tactics, and you'll have a real battle on your hands.

An all-time classic. There are 20 offensive plays and 10 defensive plays, making a grid of 200 possibilities.  Most plays have no luck -- you just cross-reference the 10x20 = 200 play outcomes.  Luck comes in when kicking for points, or with the occasional "long gain" table result.  Lots of fun, plays take time off the clock, minimal luck.

A pure battle of wits between offense and defense, with no luck involved. It doesn't actually "simulate" a football game all that well, but it puts you into the play-calling hotseat like no other game can... because there won't be a random turnover or spectacular play to save you when you make a mistake. A unique football game.

I have always liked the matrix system EXCEPT that using this for punting really detracts from the game, because you only have 2 punts to use and it is up to the Defensive player how the punt turns out. I have used, for years, a system where the defensive player chooses a return or block option, then a card is blindly drawn and used on a block or return chart.

Simple, yet effective simulation of American Football. Had a lot of fun playing this as a kid and so hence I rate it with fun nostalgic memories. You're basically just trying to get into your opponent's head and guess his play. Your opponent is trying to do the same with you. Add and subtract the chance it'll get or deny your opponent the necessary yardage (keeping in mind fouls), and you've got a good guessing game.

Very good double-think game. Both the offense and the defense choose from a matrix of plays, and the selections are cross indexed to yield a result. More interesting than it sounds when stated like that. Tough choices, and a lot of fun to play.

An old classic.
Perhaps a bit outdated, but it still works because of its competitiveness.
I was my gateway here in Europe (many years before Barcelona Dragons and NFL Europe) into american football, particularly thanks to teh "Widow's Handbook".
We organised a league many, many years ago.

Excellent sports game. I must have played this more than a hundred times. There were opponents that I absolutely "owned". I was practically in their head. On the other hand, there were some players that I would lose to regularly.
The famous remark of my long-time gaming friend Rolf "Berry" Berweiler is still in my ears: When selecting his defensive play he was oftentimes mumbling "no cards - there are no cards" (to choose from in this situation)...

Has some relation to football strategy. Has little relation to actual football.

A decent game of guessing your opponents plays and then coming up with a resolution from a chart.  It's a bit dry, but it works pretty well.  The game has certainly held up over time.  It may not be exciting for non-football fans, but it does a nice job of simulating a game.

This holds up surprisingly well, even if some of the formations and plays are more than a little dated. The basic essence of the game remains and is a fun, tactical little game of bluffing and guesswork.

I'm interested to see how differently the game plays with different offences, having only used the Pro-Style play card so far.

It would actually benefit from a little randomness in the results, I feel as I find myself often playing the odds rather than playing the down and distance...

The dice have too much influence in 1st & Goal, and too little here. Perhaps, Pizza Box Football has the right balance for me.

Using a simple matrix system for determining play results, its an easy game to learn and play.

It's a game of outguessing your opponent in a series of table look-ups (dozens of them).  I suppose the most successful players are able to mentally track the opponent's tendencies and exploit patterns.  Is that strategy? Maybe, but it's a rather dull exercise.

I think this is pretty fair little game, mainly if you play it as a solitare game.  The board is laid out pretty stupid though, huge board that's just wasted space and then the field it tiny where you NEED the extra room.  Ahhh well design wasn't in the forefront of their minds.  My copy has the hilarious "A Wife's Guide To Football" which is nothing more than 1950's sexism at it's finest.  Still not a bad little game to play solo as it does play that was VERY well but if someone else it around...I'll play a different game. I tend to enjoy collecting the Bookshelf games so chalk another up for me. YEA!

Oh man! Really disappointed - Where is the skill, where are edge of your seat plays! We randomized an opponent (picked plays out of a hat) and we got thumped!This was amusing but for all the wrong reasons. May as well play against a monkey or small dog!

Not a bad football game. Abstract players and identical teams. Estentially an outguess your opponent game.

RATING: 5
Not the worst football simulation I've played, but a long way from being the best.  The strategy is very simple, really too simple when you're used to a bit more variation from games like [gameid=1498] or [gameid=4454].  I miss gauging the probabilities as well as the guessing game.  The fact that there are no teams also dims the replay value for me.  This might be the purest game of the football simulations out there, but it breaks down as a simulation.  The 1962 edition I have is extremely outdated, both in terms of playcalling and probabilities for things like onside kicks and in terms of components (the dials are terrible).  The retro charm is neat, however, particularly the catalog that comes with the game.

Played this even before Bowl Bound. Basic, but lots of time went into this one as well.

11/19/05 - Busted it out again this weekend. Still lots of fun and a good game. Upped my rating from a 5 to a 6.

Hadn't played this since childhood, and just picked it up again.  It holds up very well.  Lots of tension, outwitting, being outwitted, outwitting yourself, etc.  Just a pure, quick, fun game without fuss or clutter.  And yes, it is strategic and a game of (some) skill.

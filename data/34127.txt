This just doesn't work. Granted I don't like memory elements in games and this has an important one (although I would play that you can look at your cards at any time despite the extra downtime this adds) but it's just too contrived.

Beautiful card artwork. Fairly easy to learn and can be played in 30 minutes, which my family likes since most of our games take 1.5 to 3 hours to play. We really enjoy this game!

It's Ticket to Ride, turned into a memory card game, and there's too much crap to keep track of. During the game, you just play all these different cards into your "on the track" pile, and then you match up train cards to your tickets at the end of the game. The scoring part at the end of the game is much worse than at the end of Ticket to Ride. Also, much more luck-dependent than the original Ticket to Ride. The "big city" bonuses seem to be doled out pretty randomly.

I like this better, more so for personal reasons including:
1) I've played TtR, 1910, and Europe to death. I won't ever play them again. Too many other great board games and not enough time.
2) I purchases Ticket To Ride Pocket, TtR Europe Pocket, and all of their IAP as day one purchases. I stopped playing them a few days later... I even got tired of the digital versions of those games.
3) the box for the board game simply eats up TOO MUCH space. IMO, TtR the cg mimics enough of what I liked about the bg, without taking that much table space either.

Reasonable - a bit more cut-throat than the board game, but I didn't find it quite as appealing or enjoyable despite that.  Almost like a card-game version of Facebook's Pack Rat in some ways.

An average game.  The train-robbing element makes for an interesting twist, but overall this game doesn't make it to the table that frequently.  If people are in the mood for Ticket to Ride, they generally opt for the real thing rather than its younger brother.

RATING: 6
Feels odd, i'm undecided on whether this is balanced or not but it feels tight with 4 players as colours are frequently present and/or contested, lots of tension over ensuring other players don't get too much benefit from colours in front of them if possible. Would happily play it a few more times to get used to it.

2 player games seem weak as written as there is very little competition for colours, may try it with some tweaks like having to play 4 different and/or you only start skimming off the top after cards have been on the table for two or three turns.

Wow, I didn't really like this game...and I like TtR!  Heavy memory element for the normal game.  Heavy hand manaement for the "beginner" game.  I don't think I'll pick this one up.  Part Bohnanza, part Mamma Mia!, part something really bad.

An interesting card-based version of everyone's favorite train game.  Well done.  I like how there's a memory element and a small screwage element.  Fun game.

Bought mail order to make up the order for free shipping! Not as good as the board game but packable into your suitcase for travel playing. 

Need a memory here - the On-Track pile of your cards is FACE DOWN and you are not allowed to look at it during the game. I can`t remember two cards in there let alone 22.

Played this as a 2 player game - it's a crap-shoot. Really no strategy except process as many trains as possible, rob a few trains, and collect tickets. Not really possible to plan which routes to complete - too numerous to play. Just keep dumping a bunch of train cards into your hidden stack and hope for the best.

The original Ticket to Ride game had a pasted on theme; but, compared with Ticket to Ride: The Card Game, the original is a detailed simulation, monster railway sort of game! Pretty standard type of card game. A "great" memory is not required to play well, but a "decent" memory definitely is! Mild modicum of player interaction. Far superior to Mamma Mia, a game that is similar in many respects. Far inferior to the board game incarnations of TtR, games that have little in common with the card game, other than theme (or lack thereof!).

I hate the memory component, but I understand it's there because it slows the game down if people are looking at their cards all the time.  However, I just modify the game to make it so that you can only look at the cards when it's not your turn.  Voila.  Done.

especially tentative rating.  i played with four, and that apparently introduces wonky mid-game scoring in order to prevent the deck from disappearing.  the goal makes sense and i'm not sure how else it might be handled, but i didn't like that part.  the rest of the game was just okay.  i heard about its memory elements and it's very real, has sort of a mamma mia feel.  i think mamma mia is a better and more scalable game though, and i even got more of a kick out of the ordered memory stuff in that.  it seems like it could be easily removed without breaking the game in ttr:tcg.  it was suggested that it was part of the fun, but i dunno.  i offered to play it 2P afterward during some downtime and it was suggested that it's not good with two either, but i'm still willing to give it a go with three.  once?

Szerencsétlen módon azok a küldetések érnek több pontot, amelyek bónuszt is érnek. Nagyon függ a játék attól, hogy húzol-e vakon dzsókert. Talán ki kellene próbálni dzsókerek nélkül játszani vagy úgy, hogy mindenkinek személyes dzsókerkészlete van, amikor abból húz, akkor csak egyet húzhat. Így elkerülhető a dzsókerhúzás szerencséje illetve a felcsapott lapok készletének bedugulása az 5 dzsóker miatt.

Miserably boring, too much "take that", too much card memorization, and too much of a "that's it?  the game is over" feeling.  The end game has not tension, just a level of "well I can't do anything productive.  What's the point of taking a turn?"

Needs work on end game rules and definitely needs improvement on the mechanic for completing routes.

If you LOVE TTR, then you might like this, otherwise, there are so many other better things that I would do to fill my time.

Very enterteining game.  Beautiful cards to play with.  It gets somehow the feeling of the original Ticket to Ride, but it is certainly a completely different game.  It play in the right amount of time, so that you can complete several tickets, but doesn't make itself too long to get bored.  It has some luck element, but not too much.

Only a couple of 2 player games so far.  I'm not sure I "get" the strategy in this.  Is it just memory?  Or do you just blindly pick train cards and keep all tickets hoping to get a  reasonable match come the scoring round?  Probably works better with more players...

Fun ticket to ride game, the memory asset adds a different element to it, I like the steeling and way you can lay down cards, in addition to pulling the bottom card off the bottom of your stack to add to your face down pile.

Adaption of the original game with an added memory component to spice things up. Can be fairly challenging for some people because of this. Still plays fluently and quickly. For four players there don't seem to be enough route cards to satisfy the demand. Game lasts too long because two rounds are played. Does not seem well polished.

I see the similarities between this and the board game, but I'm not sure that I like the added memory mechanic.  Also, with 4 players it seems that it's entirely possible to complete every single ticket available.  This means that it may be advantageous to just go nuts grabbing tickets at the beginning of the game and then concentrate on completing them later.  That seems to spoil some of the fun, but could be a legitimate strategy.

Another thing I'm not so excited about is the fact that this game can be much more vicious than the standard game.  Since you have the train-robbing rules it is very easy to cut another player off and stop them from getting the cards they need.  And finally, there is no logic to the ticket selection.  Since you can't use the same trains to complete more than one route to a location, you can just jump from one area to another with no regard for the actual map.  Although it contains a lot of little things that I don't enjoy, with my family it can still be fun.  It's not my first choice of games, but for an occasional break from standard Ticket to Ride, this will do nicely.

Two player.  Never really played a card game where it payed to actually know what you are putting in the pile.  Thankfully, I have a good feel for what I did, as did my wife when we played as I made all my tickets and my wife missed only one.  Potentially a mean game as you can wipe out tickets of someone elses.  If playing intensly, I could see that being something to pay attention to.  Looking forward to playing with four.  It's a nice game.  A good addition as it is different that anything of the card games we play right now.

Okay game.  There is a fairly large memory component.  Major city bonuses are pretty random since you have no idea what cities your opponents are going for.  

The 2 player game is a bit unwieldy... you complete tons of tickets and scoring takes a long time.  As a 2-player game, it is easier to get cards into your "keep" pile because it is harder to execute train robberies.

RATING: 5.5
Card game based on the TTR boardgames. Lots of luck of the draw in picking cards, a bit of stuff your neighbour in there at times and a memory aspect as you put cards aside to match the colours on your tickets.

This was interesting to play, but it's not one that I'll go out of my way to play again.

It seems unfair to have to remember what I've collected.  I know this is done to speed up the game, but my (lack of) memory skills really puts me at a disadvantage with this.  I would rate this higher if the normal rules allowed for you to see your collected sets.

No conozco el ticket to ride de tablero, pero este de cartas está bastante bien. Es rápido de explicar y ultrarapido de jugar (un turno dura 10 segundos, si tienes claro que hay que hacer). Tienes que asegurarte que obtienes los vagones necesarios para cumplir el mayor númro de tickets al final de la partida.

No lo he jugado demasiado, pero cuando lo he jugado me gustó. Lo compré en nexus en lugar del exploradores. Fue un error. Me gusta más el exploradores. De todos modos, al final he acabado teniendo los dos, así que no hay problema :-)

As it is, the theme is really a stretch, but the game play is pretty good. It's not a game I really need to own, but I'm happy to play it if suggested.

I enjoyed it - rather nice re-working of TtR with a liitle added nastyness - not a bad thing.  Didn't really enjoy the memory element from 'no looking' rule but as that's optional I would play without in future (though perhaps with a 'not during your own turn' qualifier as I can see it slowing down the game).  On first play, the final bonuses seemed almost random but perhaps with experience that would be less the case.

OK, no, TtR:tCG has a lot more memory than Mama Mia!. For me, sometimes I'm in the zone and can remember stuff and the game is fun, sometimes I've got nothing and the game is a little dull. You do need to track cards at some level.

Still, TtR:tCG works for me, which the various board games do not. In fact, I would actually argue that the TtR board games are not well balanced games due to the fact there is actually very serious imbalance in the scoring of the tickets, while the card game seems to do better. Anyway, I don't play any TtR board games any more, but I do kinda like the card game.
---
Just an initial impression, but as someone who is decidedly not a fan of Ticket to Ride, I might actually like the card game. It's not awesome, but I thought it was clever. I played it more as a risk management game than as a memory game, and I think that was (for me anyway) the way to go. The memory component is significant but not nearly as much as, say, Mamma Mia!.

RATING: 3
The memory aspect totally kills this game for me.  While you're allowed to look at your tickets, your train cards go in a face down stack that you're not allowed to look at once they're played.  This means that you have to remember everything you've played in order to satisfy your tickets correctly, and thus means that I really hated this game, as any memory game just feels like work to me.  While there's probably a good game here, it's just not my thing.

This is a fun game.  It is faster than the main train game, and isn't as messy.  It definitely plays different based on the number of players, as the "screw you" factor is more deliberate with only 2 players, but becomes more common (and accidental) with 4 players.

An excellent rendition of the original game, and is definitely the "little brother" of the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Ticket_to_Ride_series]Ticket to Ride Series[/url] akin to what [gameid=8217] is to [gameid=3076].

RATING: 6.5
This variant of Ticket to Ride is not very similar to the board game even though you are trying to collect sets of colours in order to complete destination tickets. The game is quite a bit more brutal than the board game because you directly try to get your opponents card thrown out of their Railyard into the discard pile; you also must be aware of how quickly the deck is running out because the game essentially ends when it runs out.

This game requires a good memory of what you've collected and discarded as well as figuring what is likely to be left in the deck. Basically, if you can card count you will rock at this game because you will know exactly how far to push (how many destination tickets to take). Whilst I can't be bothered card counting, I try to keep a general idea of what cards I've successfully collected (lots of blue; no yellow, etc).

You should really take note that the more people playing the game, the fewer destinations you will be able to complete. I have noticed this far more in this game than in regular Ticket to Ride. I think we might have tried to play it with 5 people when we were hiking and didn't bring the rules - DON'T TRY IT (there's a reason it only plays 4).

We do enjoy this game (and it's really portable if you ditch the box!), but think of it as pretty separate to the original Ticket to Ride. It can be brutal but fun and probably isn't the best for younger kids (that is, if they are playing adults).

My rating is lower because I'm not a big fan of card games in the first place. I think this game if fine for what it is.  I also think it may be a bit preferable to the original game, but it would need repeated playings for me to sort that out, and that won't happen.

The components are fantastic. I like the card quality, and wish that every card game would use something like this. There is an interesting mechanic with the tempo. I get the impression the game works best with 4p, by a long shot. 

The endgame scoring was a bit annoying, since it requires pencil and paper. I just don't particularly need to be looking for another card game to play. I want games with more meat on the bone.

I still like the board game better. The train theme becomes "pasted on" in this card game. However, we really enjoyed our first play of this game. Beautiful artwork on the cards. Fun scoring. Pretty fun. I don't know if I'd like it that much if I wasn't already a big fan of the board game. Definitely try the board game first then move on to the card game if you just can't get enough or need something more portable.

A passable variation on the TtR franchise, it retains set collection as being the key mechanism.  There is also the familiar use of locomotives as wild cards, and route cards that must be completed if kept.

The differences come in how the train cards are acquired, but also the use of cities.  The cities in general have no meaning, except for 6 key hub cities.  The player connecting to each hub the most often gets an extra bonus.

Although it's a decent diversion, playing this just made me want to pull out the board game version.

Production: Great looking train cards and tickets.  My only quibble is that the backs of the cards look just like the front, except for some pink train.  Play: A fun set collection game, with plenty of opportunity to thwart one's opponents.  The three decisions one makes on one's turn are interesting, and it feels tense, especially when trying to get away with playing one card each of three different colors, and hoping, noone beats them with a larger set.  Has a huge Mamma Mia! quality to it, trying to remember which colors I have in my deck, and therefore whether I've yet completed my tickets and can draw more, or if I still need to get more cards into the deck.

Game is fun and would rate higher but but scores feel random as you can't keep track of all your cards and tickets,and hard to know who will get the big city bonus points.

Timing the end game is tricky and can be important!

Rating based on a single play. Memory element is being conflated, IMHO - remembering what's in your stack, at least in terms of how well you've done with your tickets, is not that hard to do. I also felt the tension in the game was great, on a par with Maerklin. Tickets in any of the TtR games are a random element, but you don't have to keep any in this variant, and there's no "already have that" factor. For time, space, and portability, this game is a worthy addition to the franchise and those who poo poo the game because of the memory element after one playing are wusses. There, I've said it. Wusses. If you can remember your phone number, you can remember what's in your stack, Jack.

Players collect sets of illustrated Train cards, which are then used to complete Destination Tickets - routes between two cities depicted on each ticket. But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of "train robbing," where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards.

The card-drawing rules carry over from the board game, but little else will remind you of it. Fulfilling destination tickets is the core of the game, but you do so by remembering the colors on the cards that you have turned over --- a far less interesting mechanism than trying to connect a series of cities. Also, the conflict in the new game may be more direct than Ticket to Ride lovers will want: stealing cards versus blocking routes.

I have only played this as a 2-player game but I really do not like it.  I doubt I'll try it again (except perhaps as a 3-player game to see if there is some redemption for it).

First of all, it does not have the same elegant simplicity as T2R.  There is a huge memory component, there are a lot of minor things to keep in mind in regards to how to score points, the theme does not make any sense (in other words, it is a very abstract game), the rules are not intuitive (although drawing the train cards uses the exact same rules as T2R making that part easy for people who are familiar with the board game), you have to shuffle back and forth between several decks (my wife did not play with the "memory" rule so she had to constantly pick up 2 of the 3 different decks and look through her cards to count where she was at), and the final scoring at the end of the game takes A FULL 10 MINTUES!  For a game that is supposed to be a "30-min" game, it is unacceptable to have 10 minutes of that time be figuring out which tickets you made, figuring out who receives the bonus cards, and then adding up your score.  In our last game, my wife had 152 points and I had 150 something with another 4 cards which we did not add up.  Wow.  I am very disspointed with this game.

But... if you are not looking for a gateway type game (if your favorite games are the top 10 here on the BGG, yes, this means you), then this might be a game that you can enjoy.

Players collect and meld train cards, then stash them into a deck used at the end of the game to make tickets (victory points).  Pretty standard portage of the board game into the card game, with the board and route-planning surgically removed and replaced by a Mamma Mia stack of pizza ingredients (err, trains).  Season with some light area majority rules and you have the card game.  Pretty vanilla, worth a play or two, but too expensive for three decks of cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Still not sure what I think.  The memory element is not as taxing as I'd feared, because unlike Mamma Mia you don't have to remember the order and you don't have to remember what other people play.  The "train robbing" aspect kind of bugs me, though.  And the endgame seems weird-- it feels like you should get another turn or two of moving cards from your railyard, because why would you do anything other than take tickets on the last turn?

Better than I expected, especially with 3 players.  In fact, this has a very heavy "sweet spot" at 3 players.  4 is tedious since you basically have to play twice, and 2 is too easy where the player with better tickets should win.   The fact that you can "blow up" other players trains makes it fun.  I surprised that people think this game is too heavy on memory elements.  Do people actually count cards?  It's better to just invert your tickets as you get them finished and then get a bunch of wilds to make up the difference.   It's not a taxing game whatsoever.

There are some really great ideas in this game, such as (1) limiting what people can play based on what other people have in their play area, (2) making people discard sets from their play area when someone plays a larger set, and (3) having to choose between playing sets of cards or 3 singles.  It also keeps with the TTR theme of the way you draw cards, how you collect sets of cards and then complete routes.  The unfortunate thing about the game is that it's quite chaotic and I don't like the memory aspect of what cards you have banked for end game.  They recommend for beginners to be able to look at these cards, and I have tried playing it that way.  With this method game play really bogs down as people are constantly looking between their hand, their tickets and banked cards.  This could have been really great but instead I find it to be pretty mediocre.  I will likely try it again to see if my opinions change.

I have no idea why anybody would want to make a simplified version of a game that is already simple and quick to play.

What a mess. I understand that they wanted to retain the play/flavor of the original, but that's all they got right here. Felt completely random and pointless to just start grabbing colored trains to fill random destination tickets.

Playing trains to "blow up" other peoples rail piles simple to ruin their build up of a color for some mystery ticket in there hand is not the same as the tension of laying track on the board and getting in their way. Grabbing train cards is way less exciting as in the original where you need a color for an all or nothing play, and not simple, "well who cares it will match one of these tickets in hand."

A decent game, but just not my thing - too much confrontation and memory required.  It's not really a light or social game, because to play well you really need to concentrate very carefully of cards played.  It's quite intense, and also has somewhat of a take that factor that can be frustrating.  Strategically trying to score points with the final city scoring seems to be almost possible, and so the distribution of points in the second half of the game seems almost random (I'd be inclined to play without it).  Great quality artwork and cards though!

A game that takes too long and is nowhere near enough fun to make it worth the hassle. Just a memory game with the ticket to ride theme tagged on to make it sell more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ticket to Ride is just about as perfect of a game as I have found (it's one of my top three of all time), so it will be very difficult for me to like a derivative. This does not meet that expectation. As many others have already stated, I don't much care for the memory aspect of it. I prefer games that rely more on reasoning ability than memory capacity. If the cards were open it would be much slower, further reducing the enjoyment. Why would I play this game when I can play Ticket to Ride?

(2-4 players) Whoever says this isn't a memory game is a fool.  It is a memory game but it can be mitigated a bit you're generally trying to complete a ticket or two at a time. Any more than that and the early onset Alzheimer's kicks in. Ultimately I can see playing this when I want a dose of chaos and want to work the old memory muscle (those go together these days ;)

This is nothing like the board games as it is essentially a memory game.

You collect colored trains which then turn face down and can't look at again. Have you collected the right colours and numbers for your tickets?

Its different to Ticket to ride but I still really enjoy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Underwhelmed. The only new part for me was the purging another player's colour by placing a larger set. Apart from that, nothing new here. There may be hidden depths, I just didn't do any figuring on the actual destinations for the bonus, just the colours, but doesn't that amount to the same thing anyway. I'll get a copy, but Konig der Elfen is a much better card version of a Alan Moon boardgame, one with real choices. TTRTCG may be better with more than our 3 players, and I'm happy to play again, but I was underwhelmed.

Excellent adaptation of the original.  We even Moon's masterful reuse of the Union Pacific shares playing.  I really like the way the wagons are played to form a stack which must be somehow remembered to complete the tickets.  Lots of fun and more screwage than the boardgame!

Akár jók is lehetnének az alapmechanikák, de valamiért nekem nem állt össze a játék. Sikerült elérni, hogy még kevésbé érezzem, hogy hatással vagyok a játékra, mint a táblás verziónál, pedig ez nem volt kis feladat.
A laplerakási mechanizmus jól hangzott: három különbözőt vagy legalább két egyformát, illetve az is izgalmasnak tűnt, hogy blokkoljuk egymás lerakását, valamint, hogy ki lehet ütni nagyobb sorral a másik sorát.
Viszont az, hogy nem lehet megnézni az elvitt lapokat, illetve a játék végi újra keverés nagyon béna. A többségi kártyáknak sincs semmi értelme, mert arra már tényleg 0 ráhatásod van. Végül az nagyobb sorral felülütés se tetszett annyira - biztos azért, mert túl sokszor szívtam miatta. Nem éreztem tervezhetőnek, hogy most éppen melyik játékosnál lesz 3 abból a lapból, amiből kitennék kettőt.
Lehet, hogy kettesben kontrollálhatóbb, de négyen szerintem nem sok értelme van.

An O.K. card game.  Mild screwage element.  Thematically similar to the board game, but not much similarity in play.  Memory is huge.  You sock away various colored cards and hope to have enough of the various colors to fill the requirements of destination ticket cards you have, under penalty of negative points for any left unfilled at game end.  You may NOT look at your face-down stack of colored cards you've socked away, so you just have to remember what you have/need (or, if you're like me, such brain work is not at all fun so you carry on with a vague notion and a prayer).  Only played with two thusfar.  I suspect it will be wilder and more fun with 3 or 4.

Yeach.  A train game with no little trains, what a waste.  The game is one giant memory test.  If you are good a memorizing cards that have been played you'll be good at this, if not, and I am not, then it is just a giant random draw and random play game.  Boring.  I can't really ever seeing me play this again.

Ticket to Ride: the Card game is a wonderful adaptation from board to card.  The mechanics feel familiar, and the added portability make this a strong option for fans of the series.  This is ultimately a set collection game (as is it's big brother) with a few nice twists.  Balancing the options to either collect as many destinations desired or select according to the big city bonuses is nice.  The ability to flush players trains out with bigger sets adds a nice level of mean spirited interaction.  All in all, Ticket to Ride: the card game offers a quick play, with a few decisions that are light but not without meaning.  As mentioned above fans of the series will enjoy, others may not so much.

Da jeg i forvejen ikke er tiltalt af Ticket to Ride var forventningerne ikke høje. Nogle gange kan man dog være så heldig at en kortspilsversion piller et par fine elementer ud af moder-spillet og gør det spilbart. Det lykkedes ikke i dette tilfælde. Sjældent har jeg spillet så forfærdeligt et spil. Jeg er ikke synderligt begejstret for hukommelsesspil men syntes faktisk at nogle børnespil slipper afsted med at implementere denne del, så jeg alligevel kan leve med det og i bedste tilfælde endda komme til at holde af spillet. Som hukommelsesspils-delen er implementeret i Ticket to Ride: The Card Game står jeg til gengæld af længe før jeg får begyndt. Som udgangspunkt forstår jeg slet ikke, man har valgt at implementere den i dette spil - rent tematisk giver det absolut ingen mening for mig. Da man ikke på forhånd kender samtlige billetter, man kommer til at have ved man heller ikke hvilke informationer der er vigtige at huske. Og så må man jo huske det hele. Alt i alt et forfærdeligt spil for mig! Bvadr!

Ok game but not for me.  I don't like having to  constantly look at your down cards to make sure a route is complete. If you play that you can't review the down cards - the game is almost unplayable and would get a 3.  Keeping the route cards in your hand is a pain as well. It just reminded me of why I don't care for traditional card games.

A memory game with Ticket to Ride mechanics. It is actually  more fun to play than most memory games because the railyard feature allows you to disrupt the thought processes and counting that the other players have to do to win. It's challenging and actually a good game. I can see why it gets its lower-than-7 rating (because it's genuinely not an easy game), but it is worth playing.

An EXCELLENT adaptation of the board game.  Plays quickly, and will be a BIG hit with families.  Easy to learn, yet has some touch choices and a touch of nastiness.

Great game! I really like it. You try to collect cards in the colours you need, while trying at the same time to mess with other players' plans to do the same. It plays fast and light, but there are some interesting dynamics and a variety of ways you can approach your goals in the game. I prefer it to the board game because if your routes get cut off in the board game and there is no way to detour, you're locked into a bad situation that you can't escape. In the card game, however, the situation is fluid, and you're committed to the game to the end no matter what happens.

Initial play: Really smooth gameplay goes fast, but very difficult for me to remember so many cards that are hidden from view.

What can I say? It's not Ticket to Ride, but it works. You are collecting sets of cards, but the feel of the game is different from TtR. Then there's also a memory element involved.

Several plays with my wife, not sure what to say about it yet...  It manages to evoke some of the same feelings as the board game, and the nasty knob can be turned up or down as the players wish.

Ticket to Ride is a problematic and frustrating game to me, but the part I like is fitting multiple routes together ("piggybacking"). The card game removes this aspect of the game, so that each route is independent of the rest; in fact, geography is completely absent. What's left is a take-that card game that relies heavily on memory.  Meh.

Bought this as it was cheap and we love TtR board games. It was a bit different, but we enjoyed it.  You have to gather the colored train cards in order to complete your routes on cards (between 1-4 colored cards needed for each).  But you can't look at the train cards you've collected until the end scoring. Interesting.

In general, everyone in our group, including myself has been gaga for the series.  However, TtR:tCG is going to break with the pattern.  There are some really interesting things in this game.  Timing, concentration in a color vs. a wider spread.  But, on the whole, it feels unfinnished.  The memory aspect is not engaging, like Mama Mia.  It seems to get in the way of the fun part of the game.  That said, you also wouldn't want people constantly filing through their card piles.  But that's what I mean.  It feels like there was a rough edge there that went unresolved.

Básicamente cada jugador trata de ir haciéndose con cartas de vagones de colores (hay comodines) para completar una serie de tickets que requieren una combinación de colores (diferentes colores, diferentes cartas de cada color)

En función de la complejidad del ticket tiene menor o mayor valor. 

Muy simple, se puede jugar con el piloto automático puesto

A little better than the boardgame IMO just because it’s the same game essentially (set collection) but much faster so the game time matches the weight this time which means I'll actually play this as a filler.  

A little dirt is possible here and can help you win a close game so something you need to watch for.  Not a bad filler, very very light and luck filled but short like it should be unlike the boardgame, this is a filler game with a 20 minute filler game time.

Rated based on 2 two-player games.  Nice memory-based, set collection card game with a "take that" element. I am too busy trying to track my routes to remember much of my on-the-track stack or mess too much with my opponent (although a well-timed train robbing can affect the game). Rating may rise with more plays.  The end game scoring is a bit overly fiddly - lay out tickets, match up trains, if tickets are incomplete optimize, prove completed tickets, count for big city bonuses, finalize score, determine winner.

I like "Mamma Mia!" even though I don't like games where a main element is memory, because Mamma Mia is short enough and mistakes are really forgiving.

The girlfriend liked it however so I may have to add it to my collection anyway...

This game has a needless memory element, a clumsy "take that" mechanism and scoring that is completely determined by luck of the ticket draw.  What decisions there are to be made, and they are not many, I'm not interested in making.  My main strategy was to draw cards as quickly as possible to get the game over with.  I have zero interest in playing this game again.

On the positive side, the art is among the best I've ever seen for a game.  It's sad to see such wonderful artwork wasn't given gameplay worthy of it.

I like the mechanic of the "Train Robbery", as well as not really knowing if you are going to make all of your tickets unless you have a photographic memory and remember every card you placed in your "On-Rail" deck.  Got the feeling of ticket to ride board game only played in a lot less time.

**UPDATE**
After 2 plays as a two player game I have realized this game sucks as a 2-player game needs atleast 3.

RATING: 8.5
Complete routes by claiming colour cards, but you can't consult which colours you've claimed -- meaning you need to be very careful in your selections while still trying to screw your opponents by stopping them. It's Ticket To Ride devices and goals but with an entirely different mechanic. A real brain buster!

BIG PLUS: different game, mental challenge, easy to learn but lots of strategy
BIG MINUS: mental challenge is much higher than normal Ticket To Ride

A huge memory game element when it comes to completing your tickets, which wasn't particularly fun.

It's definitely a different game than the board game.

The most disappointing game I have ever purchased.  I love ticket to ride the board game(as well as most family members).  Felt like some kind of rummy variation that was not even fun to play.

edit(7/14) - finally found a use for the game, just converted the cards to a coloretto deck.  Marked the orange cards with a +2.

Great light game if you don't take it too seriously.  If you have to remember everything and make your stack perfect, you will be miserable - there's just way too much to remember.

6/10 after first play but might rise with further plays. Surprisingly high level of direct confrontation in the 4-player game resulting in possible kingmaking.

I prefer the boardgame to this one, and TtR:TCG is still a lot o fun and uses the same concepts.  I like the being able to steal trains, and the alternate way of getting destinations compared to the boardgame works fine.  Besides, this version is a whole lot more portable for traveling.  If you don't like memory games, you probably won't enjoy this and in general, if you like TtR, you'll probably like this take on it.

A pleasant surprise.  The game is relatively simple and fast playing, and seems to maintain the feel of the board game, probably because of the common artwork.  It shares mechanisms from other games I enjoy (Crazy Chicken, Mamma Mia), which makes it seem somewhat familiar.  I like the "take that" and memory nature of the game, though I realize that these things may put some players off.  I hope to play this more, get the play time down, and hopefully have it be a regular filler in our game rotation.

The game has something in common with Ticket to Ride: trains, the way to obtain them, completing the destination tickets. However, contrary to TTR, it has a memory aspect: players have to remember which cards are already collected, and which are missing. This makes it similar to Mamma Mia, except that trains are collected personally and not in the common pool.

Žaidimas turi šį tą bendro su Ticket to Ride: traukiniai, jų gavimo būdas, misijų vykdymas. Tačiau skirtingai, nei TTR, jis reikalauja atminties: kurias korteles jau pasidėjai, o kurių dar trūksta. Tuo jis kiek primena Mamma Mia, tik tiek, kad traukinius visi kaupia atskirai, o ne į bendrą krūva.

I'm not quite what to think about this game.  I already know that it won't ever come close to TTR for me (which I rate a 10, and love playing with my parents).  It seems to be primarily a intensive memory game, but without the joy of something like Mamma Mia.  But this second playing I liked it a bit better than my first playing.  We played the first game that you can look at your "on-the-track" cards, which actually makes it worse since it takes way too much time to try to match up the routes.I also think that there is a problem with the theming.  I keep using the term "harvesting" for the action of taking the cards from the railyard to the "on-the-track" cards.  That seems like a much more natural description of the action, but it really doesn't apply to railroads.I was a bit disappointed that the cards were not in the same numbers as the TTR games (there are only 10 cards of each color instead of 12).  If they were, I could use the cards from the card game as substitutes for the board game.  I also think the back design for the train cards looks too much like a different color of the front, which makes it difficult to distinguish.  I'm disappointed in this offering from Days of Wonder.

Csakhogy én onnantól kezdve, hogy beláttam, esélyem sincs megjegyezni bármit is, szerencsejátékként kezeltem, és csak pakolgattam ide-oda. Néha húztam, néha raktam, nem sok rendszer volt benne.

It is an okay game with a memory element as you try to remember what tickets are in your stack so you can complete the most tickets that you've collected.  As well, bonus points are awarded for hitting the major cities the most with the tickets you've collected.  Overall, just nothing that special and I prefer Mamma Mia in this genre over this one.

RATING: 6
Somewhat similar to the board game, but nicely designed to make it fit a card game format. The end is a bit clunky, might be better to have an "end" card shuffled into the bottom of the deck.
The luck of the tickets is still too great for a game of this length. 
Trying to remember what cards you've "stored" is painful, but definitely adds something to the challenge.

We got [thing=34127][/thing] in another trade. We've enjoyed the TtR series, although we've started to grow past it (at least when it's just the two of us). As a card game, we were hoping to get a quicker, cleaner, and more portable TtR experience---and we're always looking for a good, portable game. Unfortunately, the game only partly works for us---the tickets and card drafting mechanisms feel like TtR. However, the train robbing mechanism (lifted from [thing=6137][/thing]) just doesn't give enough interaction in the two player game. There's little fear of losing your train cards, and playing three single train cards is a powerful move as you can lose a maximum of only one card by your opponent and then immediately move everything into your stack. I think this mechanism would work much better with more players, making the gameplay more risky and tense.

We actually didn't mind the memorization aspect---it's good exercise for the mind, and I tended to generally play fast and loose with it anyway. The biggest problem with the game is that it's not that portable, particularly during scoring. You have to have a big table to lay out all of your cards and match them up to each ticket, which also takes a lot of time and makes the endgame anti-climactic. And that's not even counting the Big Cities bonuses, which you then have to match up with, and which we feel are especially random and hard to play for. It makes the boardgame versions feel snappier. So the card game fails the portability aspect---if we need that much time and space to get the TtR feeling, we might as well play the TtR.

Still, we'll have to pull this out with more players as we've only tried it with two so far, as that may make the game better.

hey! was fun to play! The end game sucked. I won, and I don't know why. I hate games which degenerate into shit-crap like this one does.

This appears to be unedited rules directly written by Alan R. Moon. These are worse than if they were written in English then translated into German then translated back into English.

2011 UPDATE: Putrid Game An Affront To Humanity. Tried the variants, and variants of those. Ran the game through it's paces. We had more fun rolling dice to see who goes first. I still don't see how anyone can 'try' for the Bonus cards, it's all just random chance. I still don't understand what anyone does to 'win'.

Shame on DOW for publishing this.

Dull and mechanical and repetitive, so it might replicate a long train journey.  But for game play, it is just a way to pass time.  This is a comment on 2 player, where you have very little opportunity to affect the other player, though the game simply is not compelling enough to inflict on a larger group.  The end game once cards are played is a fiddly accounting of all the tickets played, then sorting out who wins the bonus cards.  In all of this, there is very little control or strategy, just play the cards you get, judge how many tickets you can make (usually more than you expect due to wild cards), then add up the scores and somebody wins.  I keep it for my train-mad son and for the younger crowd it might be diverting.

Don't look for depth in this cardgame. It is just... a game. And although the Ticket to Ride theme is very present, it is a very different game then Ticket to Ride (boardgame). 
Fuzzy remembering. That is how I would call the activity that you are expected to do during the game. Remember more or less, the cards you have collected, and see if you were to optimistic or pessimistic about your catch, at the end of the game. 
Nice game to take with you on a holiday. Especially interesting when you want to play a quick game with 2 players once in a while without to much brain activity.

Maybe a little bit to much mechanic, and too little fun.

I guess this game got his "sauce" from [thing=49][/thing] by replacing the "shared" ingredient pile by a "personal" trainwagon pile.

Memory extreme! Actually, I think playing with someone who seriously spent the time and energy to memorize everything perfectly would be terrible. I play with more of a general feeling of what I need to be going for and evolving based on how things are playing out between others.

A good game with 3 players, different enough from the TtR boardgames. Room for nastiness and some clever tactical play, but not too much in the way of strategy. The 2-player game is much less interesting I think.

Alan Moon. 2-4, recommended with 2-4 says BGG poll.

This one really fell flat with me and my wife.  Maybe more players would improve the game, but overall it was very boring.  It seemed that the best strategy was to always lay down 3 cards of varying colors.  Then even if your opponent stole one you would still get two cards into your track pile every round.

This game is like Mamma Mia but with trains instead of Pizza and you work on your own orders alone. 

It also has a more direct "attacking" feature by being able to make others toss their cards after working so hard to get them. Sometimes it doesn't matter because they got what they needed out of the stack before this happens but sometimes it really hurts to lose your cards if it is a color you needed for multiple routes. 

I like it ok, but I doubt it will become a favorite since my memory is not my strongest mental talent. 

At the time I rated this, I had played it 3 times in 3 days. All 4 player games.

More likely Ticket to Ride: The UnGame. Say what you want, this is still a memory game, and a dead boring one for that matter. There are certain variants pushing towards to the feel of the original, but hey, I already have the board game. So I think it's just a rip off, riding the name and wonderful graphic design of TTR. 
It's only redeeming quality that if you don't already own a copy of Coloretto, you can play it with this one; you have more than enough cards in there for that.

This surprised me positively. Ordinarily I hate memory-games, I didn't hate this. Probably the best way to turn the TtR-series into a card-game.

3 players is probably the sweet spot - can't even imagine it being too fun on 2.

Also, the card-backs should definitely have been more distinct from the purple train-card fronts.

Printed the US map and the Switzerland map and laminated them. With the spare Switzerland destination cards and the some whiteboard markers this is a great travel version of TtR. When I got TtR 1912 I also did this for the Europe version.
Now that I also got TtR-vanilla plus 1910 I just use the small cards of the US edition and don't need the card-game anymore (although the card game has more destinations).

I like the basic mechanic of this game a lot.  The idea is that you need to bank cards.  To do this, you have to lay out a matching set of cards (all blue or all red, for example) and on your next turn you get to take one of the cards in the set and stow it safely away.  The catch is that if someone else lays down a set of cards of the same color, but with more in the set, your cards get discarded.  I actually prefer this to the board game.

The game has some of the features of the board-game (which I play on Xbox Live), but none of the fun in my opinion. You gather up cards, gather gather gather, and then eventually the pile is gone and you work out who wins. For two players, there is no real interaction unless you want to 'train steal', which is not really worth it unless you are desperate to put down the same colours as your opponent, not to mention that until the game ends, there is no real sense of achievement, where on the board game, you can see what you are aiming for.

Absolutely love this game. It's SUCH a fun card game. Great with two players, but plays well is 3 and 4 also. The more you play this game, the better it gets. (We usually abandon the rule that you can't look in your "off the track" stack. It's incredibly difficult to keep track of everything, but it does make it more competitive, though it can completely screw you over.)

My wife enjoys this game more than the board game. I enjoy the board game more. The card game requires a bit more luck I think, but I usually lose, so that may not be true. 
Differences between the board game and the card game? Well, the card game is a little faster and requires less room to play. The rules are a little heavier on the card game and you have to use your memory quite a bit more. You use a pile of cards you have accumulated but can't look at to make your trains. So knowing what is in the pile is pretty important.

I think I might like this one better than the original boardgame... it just feels more tense, trying to remember what you've placed into the "on the Track" stack, etc, etc... it sure makes going for the last-second destination tickets alot harder. Need more playtime with it, as I've just played it twice now, but I think I'll be raising the rating soon.

RATING: 6.5
Based on the original TTR game, this card game has no board. Destination tickets have a number of colors to complete them. Players put cards on to the table, either three separate ones, or all of one kind. The trick is that the cards you play must exceed in length any of your opponents, and this forces them to discard that suit. The row of cards that survive an entire round go into the train stack, which can be used to fulfill destination tickets. Bonuses are given to whoever has the most tickets to certain big cities.

A memory element is required to play, and with the "train robbing" rule, and depending on the crowd you play with, can be quite cutthroat. It plays quickly and is fairly light. There is a lot of luck with the tickets you draw, there is luck if people train rob you of cards that you need, and luck with the number of wild cards that you draw. Just try to make the best with what you got.

Taking the TtR card drafting and attaching it to a semi-memory-game was an interesting choice, and it works.  The wilds become much more important in this version, as they compensate for any memory lapses.  The final scoring is a bit too much work for as light as the game is.

RATING: 8
We have played a lot Ticket to Ride, in my family, and when I got this game for birthday a few years ago, I was eager to try it out. It is surely a good addition to the TtR-games, but can never replace the original. But as being a cardgame, it has the same functions as the boardgame, and has its nerve.. Will I be able to make the routes.. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
OK, another game that has no right to be as entertaining as it is.  Simple.  Straightforward.  Mixes the better qualities of TtR with the challenge of a memory game.  Maybe about 10 minutes too long?  But satisfying.

RATING: 5
At its heart, this is a memory game. I'm reminded of 'Mamma Mia' the game about making pizzas. You have to fill a stack with train cards and then use them later to complete your routes. Since all the information is trackable, it's really about who can remember what they've put in their stacks better than the others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Set collecting with Ticket to Ride-theme. There is a memory elements that remind me of Mamma Mia although here the order of cards doesn't matter at all and everyone has their own pile. Collecting just the right cards isn't always easy but it's very easy to forget what you have already collected. Overall I liked the game more than I thought I would've.

With three players you have easier time to know what you'll actually get from display. Perhaps it is the sweet spot for the game as with four there is a bit too much uncertainty. Not bad with 4 but just a bit better with 3.

Update (13.7.2008): After second game we found out there is some awkwardness in card distribution. City prize cards have different values (8-15) and not all destination tickets have two prize cities on them making some cards better than others. It seemed odd that there were (at least) two destinations that only need one train card to be completed but they have two prize cities on them. These seem quite powerful as they give as much points straight away and also give better chances at winning (actually the best ones) prize cities.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game, but I'm not fond of games that have this type of memory aspect ("did I save three black cards, or four?")  Also lacks some of the player interaction that I like in other Ticket to Ride themed games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In my view, a comfortable improvement on the big box game. Better interaction and less incentive to obsessively set-collect. A mite long and chaotic, perhaps, but that's no bad thing when you think about the staid persistence of the board game. If you've spent a while standing around a shunting yard, it's surprising how well-integrated the mechanic is, too. A thumbs-up for some good, sturdy and tactile cardstock.

This is NOT a memory game, despite what some people would have you think. I like to think of it as a meta-memory game where you have to do some reasonable foreplanning and on-the-fly strategy in the hope that your stockpile will contain the right stuff.

Further Thoughts - After half a dozen plays, this is becoming surprisingly addictive in a non-brain-engaging way. There's something very reassuring about the 'big count' at the end of the game when you realise how well (hopefully!) your strategy has played out.

This actually works really well as a smaller-footprint version of the boardgame. The card mechanics are clever and allow for planning ahead and blocking of other players, with some risk-taking. The card artwork is nice (not happy about the card backs using purple orbs though - easy to mistake them as purple trains!).

Not as involved as the board game of course, but still engaging and fast-playing. Took a while to learn to play correctly--not sure why, as it's rated for ages 8+, and there are only 4 pages of rules in a small format. Personally, I find the memorization rule extraordinarily difficult, but my approach to that is to count the number of cards I've claimed and then count the number of colored ovals I have to fulfill, plus try to maximize how many wild cards (locomotives) I claim. Overall, I like the game. The board game version fell flat with my family, so this went better, at least in playing with my sister, who liked it so much that in December of 2010 I gave it to her.

It is a great mix of mechanisms and plays relatively quickly. It has a bit of memory, a bit of pushing your luck and a bit more. The only issue is whether the end scoring of the cities is possibly a bit arbitrary.

For something that is easily portable, this isn't bad, and I will play it depending, but I'd much rather pull out the full game than this.

It does a nice job of catching the essence of the board game, but adding in some big, gut-wrenching viciousness for those who aren't paying attention to who has picked up what along the way. It's too much work to keep track of what you've stored away, which leads to somewhat of a surprise ending. It increases the value of those wild loco's, but there's a tempo cost to collect them. A different feel from other games out there. There are times I feel it's just too vicious though, when a big suit play gets wiped by a bigger wildcard set and can knock someone out of the game.

"Filler with some elements reminiscent of TtR. Very strong memory element. Can be a bit nasty."

What I like:
- Played pretty quickly (30 minutes)
- Good graphic design, except for the busy card backs

What I don't like:
- Very strong memory element
- Counter-intuitive central mechanism
- More attacks than I prefer

The tickets, train cards, and card drafting are all similar to TtR. Everything else is very different. The memory aspect pretty much kills this game for me. With an open variant, it might work, but that would slow the game down a lot.

I would put the weight around 1.7, slightly below the BGG-voted weight.

I enjoyed playing this game more then I had anticipated. Although I think the rules don't quite reflect the theme, I still think the game has overall been accomplished quite nicely. It requires you to have a prety good memory if you wanna be sure you want to win, or at least manage to score all your tickets. The cards are of fantastic quality, very large, good material. They even use symbols for each color for colorblind people to be able to play this game, which is a very nice touch! I have played the original game only online, but I'm tempted to say that I prefere this one over the board game, since I don't really think that the game, for what it is, justyfies the price, so I'd rather have it as an easy to carry around, cardgame. Nice one this one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The first play seemed a bit random. A couple additional plays shows there is a bit of strategy as to which tickets you take, mostly by focusing on a couple of the bonus cities. With two players, the winner seems to be the one collecting more locos (which results in fewer unfinished tickets.)

Didn't really take, all the players were regular TtR players and this elicited lots of blank looks as we went through the rules and the general feeling at the end was "rather play the board game". I'd give it a go again, maybe with just 2. I'm not sure about how this is marketed (travel TtR), I find the board game very portable once out of it's box - regularly take 2 or 3 boards, 1 deck of cards and the trains in a backpack

I'm a big fan of Ticket to Ride, and I didn't enjoy this at all.  This mapless game isn't even a connection game--the tickets you get are completely independent as far as trying to fulfill them.  Plus, the game adds a mean "take-that" mechanic where you can destroy other people's train cards.  I don't really see what this game has to offer.

I sold this game away due to not grabbing me.  I was looking for a quicker, more portable TTR game.  This had a lot of card laying and took as long as a regular TTR game, without the travel feel.  I felt I'd just stick with the TTR board games instead.

A quicker way to play TtR.  Strikes me as a cross between the original version (with the luck in the destination cards) and Mamma Mia! (in trying to remember what's in your stack).  Not really unique enough to thrill me, but it's a quick version of the original and serves pretty well as a starter while you wait for others to show up.  Played once with three players.

Tough game that stresses you memory. You play cards to the table and if noone plays cards that remove them, you get to move one from each color to your pile at the start of your next turn. At the end of the game this pile of cards is matched up to the tickets you've collected. Since all unsolved tickets are deducted from your point total it is critical that you can remember what unused cards are in the pile to be able to match them to the new tickets you draw.

Will need more play to find better memory strategies.

Ticket to Ride: The Card Game has been much maligned but I quite liked it. The way it abstracts some of the board game mechanics into pure cards is clever, and the memory aspect has been overstated. I basically made sure I had plenty of wild cards and that I didn't have more tickets than I could possibly complete with the number of cards in my stack. In the event, I could complete all of them.

Played the prototype a number of times and quite enjoyed it. Makes for a quick game with interesting hand management decisions.

The production version's orange, yellow and red colors are far too close making the game almost unplayable. While symbols are used on the car cards to help with the colors, the ticket cards did not add the symbols which just adds frustration to an otherwise excellent game.

Not too bad, a good implementation to a card game while maintaining the basic principles. It almost seems as if you could almost collect cards at random and still do well, as long as you keep track of how train cards you have in your "on-the-track" stack vs. how many you need to fulfill your tickets. Otherwise, my only gripe is that the game rewards those with better memories.

This game shares the same motif and objectives as the board game version, but memory is key; you have to remember which colors you needed to complete your destination tickets and which colors you've acquired thus far. If games that depend somewhat on memory aren't your cup of tea, you may not choose this game; personally, I don't often enjoy games that require a good memory as a key component for victory. However, this game does rely on remembering what is in your inventory as well as on strategy and decision-making, so there's a balance, but a good memory makes the difference in victory. 

That said, this game is good fun from time to time and travels more easily than the board game version of Ticket to Ride, but it's a bit expensive for what is essential a 150-card deck (including destination tickets).

This is a card game version of Ticket to Ride, but the issue is that you have to memorize your cards as you "build" your tracks...and it just makes it a pain to play and honestly rather convoluted.

There probably is a way to make this game a card version....but this one doesn't do it for me.

--Jul2008-- My first play was not terribly enjoyable.  And it wasn't a reflection of the other players, either; they were fine.  It was the game I had issues with.  It's far too much work to keep track of the colours one has saved for the payout, in my opinion.  And the take-that mechanics to wipe out part of another player's display is also less than perfectly desirable for me.  In short:  it's a game that I could recommend to no-one.

The basic draw system from Ticket to Ride games with a memory element. It works and is fun to boot. Love the small box games that pack a decent punch. After a few plays I'm enjoying it for the 30 minute ride it is.
Update: I'm getting more out of this than I initially thought I would. Lots of player interaction as you observe the colours opponents collect. Drawing a colour out of your opponent with a two card meld and then blowing their cards away with a follow up meld is always satisfying. Rating has gone up with further play.

This game is quick, and there's a really neat mechanism to get cards from your hand into your 'cashed' pile where you can spend them to complete tickets. However, that you can't look at the cards you've accumulated feels like a chore, and I'm not sure this game uses that mechanism in the best way possible. The mechanism is great, the game is just "meh."

I generally like Ticket to Ride - even the look and style of the game - but this game is just maddening!

Requires too much memory of your prior plays. I'm okay with some (purposeful) use of short-term memory. But you literally need to keep a mental tally of colors you've played. And I just completely blow it every single time.

Plenty of folks like this, but I'm out.

You know, I really wanted to like this game more.  After all, it is a flavor of rummy, which is arguably one of my top two or three flavors of card game.  Unfortunately, it did not quite work for me.  The biggest problem I had was getting rid of another players melded cards.  Whether or not this happened seemed to be pretty random.  Random is fine, but the game is fairly random already.  This seems to make that worse.  This is bad because getting these cards into your sfe stack is extremely important.  Randomly determining who gets to keep things seems wrong, taking much of the skill away from the game.  Still, I would like to get this played again as there is some interesting stuff in there.

Set collection with a nasty twist: you get to force other players to discard their cards. Will be interested in seeing final version though the price point might be a little high...

Update;
I really wanted to like this one. To Alan Moon’s credit, it does have the ‘feel’ of TtR. Players are drafting cards in order to fulfill routes. This time, the routes are completed by having matching colour cards at the end of the game. 

There are twists: players either draft cards or put out cards. One can put out three cards of different colours or any number of cards of a single colour. However, if a subsequent player puts out more cards of any colour you’ve put out, your cards in that colour are discarded. If the turn goes round without any discards, you put aside these cards.

Memory element: Now, you know your route BUT you can’t look at the route cards you put aside. As a mechanic, it’s fun and adds some agony to decisions. However, there is thematic disconnect: why should cards put aside be secret? What does it represent?

The pluses are the portability (though the price point is a little high for a card game) and erm…that’s it. The graphic design is overly ornate (it’s hard to tell the backs and fronts of train cards) an symbols could be larger.

Solid lovechild of Drive (Crazy Chicken) and Mamma Mia. The memory aspect is much easier to manage than in Mamma Mia and it is not as nasty as Drive.

Update: Game is drastically different as a two-player game. There is less knocking out the other players' cards and more dropping cards quickly to complete more tickets. Still fun but I think this may be optimal at three players - still short enough and yet there is more chance involved in play of smaller sets and competition for the bonus cards.

A nice little blend of basic Ticket to Ride mechanisms with Mamma Mia-like resource collection, except that everyone is collecting for themselves. There are also some new things: the take-that of forcing someone to discard cards, the end-game destination bonuses (although I wonder if anyone really tries for them specifically, or if you just hope for the best?). In a 2-player game, you can collect a lot of train cards; that makes it easy to draw a lot of destination tickets, but also makes the end-game scoring and calculations (which tickets did I make?) last a bit too long. 

Not a bad card game, but not one I'm likely to seek very often.

An interesting and creative way to make a card game out of TTR.  So far I've only played with my daughter, but I can see it getting pretty cutthroat and I'm quite curious to try with different numbers of players.  I like Canal Grande quite a bit, which is Alan Moon's card game version of San Marco, a game I don't care for all that much.  Here he takes a classic game and makes a unique card-driven version.  Impressive!  Update:  after four plays, I am surprisingly intrigued by the strategies here.  Moving it up to a nine!

Not a patch on the excellent board game - in fact the only aspect that links this to it's bigger brother is the theme. It's still fun enough to play though, and games are relatively short (30-45 minutes?) so it's not a bad filler game.

A nice card implementation of the succesfull boardgame. Feels a lot like Mamma Mia, but the drafting and playing of train cards is typical for a Moon game. It's defenitely a lot harder to keep track of things than in the boardgame, but since everybody has their own pile, it's not as hard as in Mamma Mia. And it's really beutiful.

This does actually capture much of the "feel" of the boardgame, with significantly more player interaction.  I do like the various boardgame versions as well, with Marklin being my favorite for its increased player interaction as well.

Anyway, back to this version--it plays quickly, much closer to how long the boardgame should take given its depth, and that is VERY nice.  The increase in potential screwage is very nice too sicne it doesn't have to come at an expense to your own expansion.

The memory component is significant, but not overwhelming because you going to be doing more risk management in getting cards out into your yard when you think they might be safe to last long enough to get onto your track.

Lastly, I must say, there is a brilliant balance found in this game between laying the multiple single-suit vs 3 different.  On the one hand the multiple single-suit makes an inviting train-robbery target and aggressive players will push that.  Plus it only "blocks up" that single suit which leaves more room for the other players to get their cards down.  

On the other hand laying 3 different suits works well because it blocks up 3 suits, leaves you with a better chance to get various cards onto your track.  plus robbing a player of a single card may be an action of chance, but even an aggressive player won't see it as a target to "change plans" for.  very cool!

All that said, two things keep it from being an 8.5 or even a 9.  First, the card backs are TERRIBLE--way too intrusive that it is actually easy to mistake them for card-fronts.  Particularly if you don't play this one frequently, and we don't play any filler that frequently.
Second and even bigger...I HATE the tracking for the most trips to a particular destination.  It HORRIBLE.  Having to "share" the points is a pain to keep track of because there is only a single of each card.  It's a part of the game that needs streamlining in some way, as current it seems absurdly tacked-on to an otherwise very tight game.

RATING: 6.5
[DoW 2008 edition] {Train; drafting, set-collection, connection, memory; optimal 4p} This game is a nice adaption from the board game but the core mechanic is a remote resemble of the board game.  It's more about blocking and memory.  Player interaction is better than expected.  It's not difficult to memorize the collected card; however, it's quite difficult to calculate how the bonus card is awarded - players can only know the result at game end and the distribution is usually a surprise.  Therefore, it can only be a light came, without serious planning.

The card illustration is pretty.  The card stock is sturdy.  I like the production quality.  Thumb up! Days of Wonder.

This was kind of a pleasant surprise! I'll be honest and say that I think the original TtR games are enjoyable enough but not the be-all and end-all that they seem to be among some Geeks. But I figured I'd give this one a shot during a long game day yesterday--especially since the designers continued to be thoughtful in using symbols along with colors for us color-impaired folk--and I think I may have enjoyed it more than the TtR board games I've played. It's substantially different--it barely even feels like the same game--but that's not necessarily a bad thing. TtR:tCG is a tense memory battle with a bit of screw-your-neighbor by canceling out their groups of colors. There's a nice feeling that you could have done better at the end, when you see that you have a couple wilds you didn't need in your deck and realize you could've easily taken another ticket or two. I'll play TtR when other people want to, but I may actually suggest trying TtR:tCG again myself; it's shorter and more enjoyable than its board game sibling, for me.

A bit more complicated than the board game, and a bit better IMO.

It lacks fun. The only fun is making HA to the opponent when you destroy their vagons, and after you count the scores.

The 4 player variant is aweful, it is like playing the game twice.

No fun. The very important and entertaining geographical aspect of the board game is gone and the memory aspect of this game is just frustrating. Very little interaction, and after a while we (me and my wife) lose track and just end up throwing colurs into the stack more or less by chanse. Don't bother!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A game about timing and luck, Timing is essential and pushing your luck.

There is also a big screwage factor that not all players would like.

Second game played, I was effectively out after 3 minutes, I lost 5 yellows after only picking up one and all my tickets required yellow.

This is way too much luck, even for a relatively short game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Far gutsier and much more of a challenge with heaps more player interaction than the board games.

The game now challenges you to play sets of cards to the table earlier than you would like to stop someone else collecting cheap cards in that colour. Also reminds me of the pizza card card where you have to remember which cards you have added to the set to build the train routes.

It must be possible to import some of these new mechanics into the board game itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
T2RCG pretty much does what a card game version of a board game should do: it captures a lot of the feel of the original with a more portable package that plays in a shorter time.  The tickets are still there, the train cards are still there, you're still playing sets of cards, but the mechanics are quite different and there is a relatively strong memory element (very similar to the memory element in Mamma Mia).  I'm not a huge fan of memory elements and that's why this game doesn't get a higher rating from me but it's a very good game and I'm happy to play it just about any time.

While I like Ticket to Ride better than the card game variation, I did enjoy playing it with my group.  For a 4-player game it definitely felt like you wanted to bulk up on your trains for the first round and then play large stacks in the second round to complete a bunch of destinations.  It was still close at the end, and if I had the opportunity to complete all of my destinations, I would have been close to winning.  I did not stack up my number of cards from the first round to use in the second.

RATING: N/A
Played 1+ times.  I like ticket to ride.  This was surprisingly fun and tense.  The only thing I didn't like was that the pile of collected train cards couldn't be looked at, but was totally trackable.  I would probably play with it open or at least you could check your own if I owned the game.  Justification: 1) I don't really care what other people have collected because I don't know what tickets they have. 2) I have to try to remember what I've stashed and it just slows the game down. 2010/03/19

I understand the comparisons to Mamma Mia, but its only vaguely like that. It really is Ticket to Ride, without a board, and faster.

This is definitely a filler kind of game and probably best for three.

RATING: 6
People give this game a lot of flak because it puts set collection front and center instead of route building. To me, set collection is the truer heart of Ticket to Ride, especially for a card game spin-off. If you enjoy a memory element in your card games, this one is actually worth a try.

Played once with 2 players, supports 2-4. This card game is a very brain bendy game involving trying to memorize what is in the On the Track Stack. Can be tough if some of the colors you need don't come out. The locomotives can make up for some of it, but only being able to draw one can be tough. Not as confrontational with 2 players and players are able to get more cards to the OtTS.

As a staunch fan and supporter of the TtR series I have to say I was excited to get this game. Reading the rules was clumsy and seems like it could have been better written. The game itself in the sense of play is dull at best and does nothing in my mind to bring the feel of the board game to a card game. Very disappointing. Could have been a better approach I'm sure or well in all honestly couldn't we have done without a TtR card game and been just fine? I think so. Hell I'd love to see Days of Wonder produce a TtR expansion game that implements itself to ALL the previous board games so one expansion that works and adds stuff to several games I already own! That would have been better to me than this game. 

UPDATE:
I've now played several games of 2, 3 and 4 player games. SIGH. Yep it's just kind of dull.

The mechanics here are pretty interesting and definitely different from the board game, which is a good thing- the game stands on its own two feet. I mean you'd think it would just feel like rummy, given the board has been eschewed and all, but it manages to be more somehow. 

So why don't I rate it higher? The central mechanic of the game, although clever, creates situations where you can really be screwed- large investments can be completely destroyed. It's reminiscent in feel to the situation in the board game where you're saving up a bunch of cards in a color to play a route, only to have that route snatched up by someone else. Except here you lose the cards too. Yes, it's as devastating as it sounds.

Mamma Mia meets Ticket to Ride.  The cards are gorgeous - the best in the series yet. Yes it is a memory game, but if you play it according to the tickets you have then then isn't too much to remember at any one time.  Played 4 player and it took longer than the 30 mins on box. Two player is very fast - no time for forgetting!  May upgrade to 9 or 10 with more plays.

I really do not think this game works as a two player.  I need to try it with more people.

Very good adaptation of the board game. I usually don't go for such adaptations either because
A) they're just bland compared to the original (San Juan), or B) they're so close to the original that I don't see the need to play the card game (Caylus MC). 
But this one hits just the sweet spot... Very nicely done.

Good alternative to the board game. This is a very good adaptation. While it maintains much of the "flavor" of the board game, it's been redesigned to play well as a card game. Also, this takes up much less space to play, and can be set up and taken down quickly.

Fun game, but even with the little symbols, the partially color-blind seemed to be at a big disadvantage.

reasonably easy, low luck factor, memory is NOT an issue, you don't have to remember that much.
maybe there are not very though decisions to make but you still have to plan your strategy. there's a fairly good level of interaction if this is your strategy.
nice !

I haven't played this with any yet that hasn't agreed that the rules need to be changed.  Everyone hates the blind train pile making the game too much about luck and too little about skill.  Their are some great variants found on BGG.

Wow! What a really fun game!  Keeps the feel of the original, but condenses it down to a nice card game that plays really quickly.  Can be REALLY cutthroat as a 2p game.

If you are concerned that your friends have grown overly fond of you, make them play this game.  You won't have that problem anymore.

Interesting. Several people thought the 3 player game was better but I liked the 4 player because you get a chance to make some runs and look at your cards again.

Played several times (with 2 or 3 players). Although it is quite unrelated game-wise to the TTR board game and its sequels, I happened to like this game as well. However, I am not too convinced by the necessity of the memory element (and we have actually played some games without it, allowing ourselves to look at our scored cards - which makes the game a bit longer but more enjoyable for some people).

Doesn't feel like the original Ticket to Ride series of games in any way. This is a memory-based card game with the Ticket to Ride theme unnecessarily attached to it as a blatant marketing ploy. There's no feeling of connecting cities, just collecting enough of the right colours. I don't like it.

Wow, is this one a brain burner. Not in the fact that turns take long but the fact that most of it is up to your memory and remembering. Fun fast paced and slightly difficult. Memory is key though.

I probably should have kept it, since my short time memory is going away.. but it doesn't make it a good game. As soon as my memory fails me, it becomes a luck fest.

Regrettably little more than a dull waiting game, without the timing element of the Ticket board game between placing early to lock in good spots and placing late to conceal your tickets. The shaft factor runs rampant - and is, indeed, the game's only real strategy - because routes don't accumulate on the board, so no longer can players observe, say, who is taking blue and where they might deploy blue on the board, but rather are forced simply to understand that person will probably hose them if they attempt to lay down blue themselves. The memory aspect is irritating and end-game bonus points are basically a toss-up. It's shorter than the original, if that's your thing...

Dare I say that this is a completely needless addition to the Ticket to Ride series and a fairly dumbed down version of the original.  The tedious memory exercise alone would turn away quite a few family members that have became fans of the board game.  What was once an interactive activity involving lively chatters is now an almost solitaire experience because everyone is too busy trying to recall the number and the color of the cards they've put on their stack.  The only good thing about this is its portability, a feature I personally don't care about since I doubt I'd ever want to play it again.

Generously given to me for free when I bought Robinson Crusoe from a maths trade. Feels kinda like the board game but the gameplay feels sloppy to me. Or maybe I just suck at trying to memorise the cards. My wife destroys me in this game.

I was surprised by the number of mechanisms new to the Ticket to Ride series, especially those that seemed totally innovative.  I was even more surprised by how underwhelmed I was by the play experience.  Also, although you've always been able to cut off people's probable paths in Ticket to Ride games, this is the fist game in which you deal the damage to existing work, knowingly.  I think the experience would improve with repeat playings, but I don't see this one rising above a [b][bgcolor=#9999ff]&nbsp;6&nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] for me.

A good substitute for Ticket to Ride (TTR) if you are on the road, but it is not as user friendly. On the track stacks and on the rail stack and various other mechanics can be confusing at first. I would definitely introduce the boardgame first before exposing this variation. On its own, I don't think I would play it as much. But, to get my ticket fix on the road, I am all over it.

After 1 Play: This is really just a memory game with a few uninspired wrinkles.  Were you to play without the memory aspect, it would be wholly decided by luck.

К одноимённой игре имеет слабое отношение. По-сути, это игра на память. Нужно собирать комбинации паравозиков и отправлять их себе в личный сброс. А потом брать квесты и вспоминать, сколько же ты разных цветных паравозиков набрал. Маршруты или соединения отсутствуют - в этой игре могли бы быть просто цвета.

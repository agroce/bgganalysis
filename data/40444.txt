Another gorgeous Menzel game.  Here especially, you can see how much his art elevates the game play.  Looks almost exactly like a Rio Grande game, down to the critically flawed translation.

Fairly average Euro these days.  Dice (but very limited luck), action selection, area majority, cryptogram-y cards.  Not bad, but nothing to really separate it from better ilk, like [b]Yspahan[/b].

Update: Traded away.

I was pleasantly suprised when I took a gamble on this game. I like how all the strategies combine and the "tall-poppy" aspect of the game. The game is so simple and well balanced.

My only grudge is that the board could be a bit bigger. The score track and score markers are too small.

I am a Thebes fan: Livingstone has almost nothing in common with Thebes, since one does not necessarily need to excavate in Livingstone.

One of Dr. Knizia's many luck-management games, with a negligible theme made bright by Michael Menzel's artwork. Dr. Knizia seems fond of taking mechanics from other games (including his own) and attempting to improve upon them. In the case of Livingstone, he borrows from Hab und Gut, where the player who has donated the least money to charity automatically loses. The difference here, though, is that (unlike Hab und Gut, where money is needed to win) money is only a means to an end. Also, Hab und Gut has simple rules yet requires deep thought. In Livingstone, the rules are somewhat more complex...yet is the lighter of the two games!

A tentative rating of 7. My rating could go up; it will definitely NOT go down!

RATING: 4
Of the three Playroom games, this one is my least favorite. It's a simple area-majority game with a clever dice-drafting mechanism, but at the end one player just plain loses based on (mostly) a memory sub-game. Bluh. We house-ruled the auto-loss into a penalty, and in my mind it improves the experience, but I don't rate games based on house rules.

Livingstone is a very well produced game with great art by Michael Menzel and gem pieces that are not your standard fish bowl decorations. It is a simple race game but that is one of its flaws. 1) It really is just a simple race in whcih you play cards to advance a ship along the board. 2) Why it is called Livingstone we have no idea. David Livingstone was a Scottish missionary but nothing about him comes across in the game thematically unless you count his image on the box cover. 3) There is a mechanism in this game that involves putting gold that you've collected into a chest during the game. If at the end of the game you have the least gold in your chest you lose regardless. We are not sure what this mechanism has to do with the theme but as the theme is just pasted on anyway it doesn't matter that much in the long run. However in a 2-player game that mechanism becomes pointless as it can be easily kept up with throughout the game. So it looks good but ... eh.

Admittedly I bought 3 copies of the game at a sweepstakes just for pillaging the components (gems, pawns, dice, cardboard money).

But when I gave it a try, it was a fun, short game with multiple ways to victory and a nice luck factor.
I even liked the treasure chest mechanism that sounded meh to me from just reading the rulebook

This game is really amusing.  It is fun to pull jewels out of the bag.  It is fun to pull cards and use them.  It is fun to place tents.  That is basically the game, so the whole game is fun.  Though simple, there are great elements of strategy to the game and choices are not obvious. I can explain the rules quickly, and the gameplay is fast.  It is one of my favorite deeper gateway games.  Every game I have played I have enjoyed.

Another spectacular offering from Playroom Entertainment that has gone largely unnoticed in Eurogaming circles despite a fair amount of hype. The excellent dice mechanic, irresistible push your luck feature, clever integration of money management and bluffing, and a very cool scoring system make Livingstone a winner on all fronts. Beautiful bits and pieces are just icing on the cake. 
I have a job that often has me playing 10 new games over the span of a week or two. I always appreciate the craft and ingenuity of the good ones, and I enjoy the opportunities they give me to sharpen my brain, but it's not often that I experience a feeling of pure fun while playing a board game. Livingstone gave me that experience.

RATING: 5.5
Another okay game with an innovative use of standard 6-sided dice.  It combines an Yspahan-like dice mechanic with a Thebes-like "informed" random draw mechanic. It's a simple but tense (tight) game if you don't mind a healthy dose of luck (rock/gem draws and action card draws). Overall, it's lighter fare, mostly forgetable, and probably has limited/no staying power.

UPDATE 2012:  It also includes donations to the queen (much like Cleopatra and the Society of Architects), and the player who donated the least cannot win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Light, pretty easy to learn and teach. That said, it does seem to be missing the most crucial element of any game...fun. Perhaps with more than two players it will be a better experience.

9-22-15 Ran three three player games back to back to back...Forget the earlier comments about a two player game. Three or more and this game comes to life, with decisions like "to go in the bag or not go in the bag." I would actually rather play this than King of Tokyo. This little sleeper has become my light-medium weight champion.

Liked this more than I thought I would. As a euro/filler it works for me, but I can see how some will loathe the luck element.

I don't like playing with 2 or 3, but with more it's fine if played at a pace as the dice pick mechanic is more interesting.

Only annoyance is the score track - the scoring disks don't fit ...

Interesting theme and cool components. Game incorporates mechanisms from different games known to general gaming public in an interesting way. I liked the dice and didn't like the use two dice card (which is very strong) and the white stone in the bag (can basically ruin your game if you happen to be unlucky).

EDIT: The rule of the white gem is really unclear in the Finnish rules but after resolving the problem with the help of BGG community (you are able to sell the stones you draw on your turn before they go into the bag) the game is much better.

This is a game where rooting for the failure of your opponents is so satisfying and well done.  The gems themselves are pretty cool. I like how they were fashioned (they feel good in the hand), and it's great fun to watch other players draw a hand full of black (value 0) gems.  

In order to succeed at this game, three things need to happen:

First, you need to guess right.  This game ultimately comes down to guessing how much other players will donate, because if you donate too much you'll lose for not having enough points, and if you donate too little you will lost "just because".   This is the most important part of the entire game.

Next, you have to be lucky.  There is wild variablity in gem draws and card pulls.  There's no way in the world you will win if you're less lucky than other players.

Finally, you need to earn enough points.  Of course, this entirely depends on 1 and 2 above.

So in the end, this entire game is about guessing right and getting lucky.

Thematically this is pretty accurate.  Heading out gem mining in the 1840s wasn't exactly a game of skill, so the above don't bother me too much.  

Unfortunately, this isn't a game I have much interest in.  It sort of dresses itself up to be a strategy game, but in the end it's a bit of an illusion.   I'd play this again, but probably wouldn't request it.

Initial rating 6.

Well designed game, but poorly translated rules, and inadequate reference cards.

It's not so bad that I wouldn't play again, but Livingstone is a mish mash of game mechanisms which seem like there weren't playtested in order to balance the game.  I can definitely see what was trying to be done here, but nothing actually works the way it was intended to work.  It seems like the first prototype of a game that needed to be playtested a lot more in order to realize its potential.  As is, it's a rather unbalanced mess of a game.

RATING: 6.5
Super fast game to play, and an enjoyable game. The only thing that slowed the game down was a few ambiguities around rules. I felt we were able to deal with them quick enough but I think it left a bad taste in Colin's mouth (after buying the game). I would play the game again, but if I was to own a game with a very similar (IMO) feel that would be Vikings. I feel that the bribing of the queen is the best mechanic, except if you have a bunch of coins at the end you're just going to pile them in... so you can't really think about that as much...)

Decent game, but a little too swingy for my taste.

UPDATE

Rated this down to a 4.  While I think there are some good mechanics, I feel there isn't enough luck mitigation to make the game fun.  Moreover, I hate the pay out to the queen mechanic.  I understand it's there to try to reign in the runaway leader, but it doesn't really work.

I really don't plan on playing this again.

Production: Attractive board and tents.  Cool stones.  The cards are too slick, but otherwise have good iconography.

Play: Other than a few murky rules, this game plays very quickly (one of the few games that plays in its advertised time).  Some nice gambling choices, between taking guaranteed coins, or risking a pull from the stone bag.  Clever use of the dice, forcing players predict their opponents' moves when selecting their dice.  Tents become more and more expensive to build, even though a player's income never increases, which is a bit of a problem.  But fun. (3+2+3) (1 play)

Each time I play this game, I like it more and more.  I've played with 2-4 players, though not with 5.  Each player adds two more dice to consider in the draft.  Plenty of strategy and a variety of fun mechanics, even though the game is pretty simple.  One could accuse the presence of the dice of adding a lot of luck, but the game offers different avenues to victory and ways to mitigate the luck of the dice.

A very undervalued game in my opinion...games with fewer components cost far more than this one.  But that's good for players who enjoy this kind of game.  When a game is this satisfying and this quick, it'll always be a winner for me.

My now 4 year old daughter requests this game often.  "Daddy, can we play the gem game?"  Needless to say, a strict gem-drawing strategy doesn't win games :o).

very fun. It's got some euro elements with the majority control and the dice selection but lots of fun chance-y elements too with the "mine" bag and the card pulls.

For a shorter game, I recommend either removing one or both of the "move a boat back one space" or only have it count for a single players turn as opposed to the whole round.

After a couple plays, we realize that the core of this game (which is the area control aspect) really isn't very good. It's bland and just not very interesting.

The gem drawing is cool and I love the bits.  But this type of game was better done in Thebes.  We got a rule about the gem refresh wrong which altered the game significantly..so to be fair, this one needs another play.  However, I still don't think it would go higher than a 6 for me.

Players are exploring Africa, basically for victory points!  Nice game, but a bit of a Frankenstein's Monster built up from other games.  A player rolls a bunch of dice, Yspahan fashion, which are claimed and used to take actions.  Actions include grabbing gems or dirt from a bag, Thebes fashion; placing camps on the board that looks like Stone Age's art; grabbing gold (Yspahan again); or drawing cards.  Gold can be donated to the Victoria and Albert coffers, entering a secret chest to be revealed at the end of the game - the player donating the least is eliminated right away (High Society via Cleopatra).  Still, really nice game - the dice claiming mechanic is well implemented, the game doesn't drag, and offers a nice payback for the time invested.  Good stuff.

Great components. I like how the dice rolls are used to create entropy and at the same time, how well balanced the amount of that entropy is compared to many other games that involve dice rolling.

This plays very quick when all players know what they are doing. End game scoring can be a bit anticlimatic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
One of those games that mixes interesting decisions with uninteresting randomness. You take a die on your turn and then an action with that die, but on subsequent turns, you must take a die higher than the one you took previously. Going about scoring points is relatively interesting in this regard as is the fact that the person with the least coins reserved for the queen at the end of the game is eliminated, so it may not necessarily be the person with the highest score.

Unfortunately, amidst all that the bonus cards are very swingy and pulling gems from the bag can make or break you. The mix of time spent on decision making and then having decisions unmade by the randomness feels disjointed to me.

Bought March 2014, on the basis of an underrated games geeklist. 

After my first play: With two players, very interesting and extremely quick. A pleasant medley of dice-actions, area control and chit pull gambling. 

Plays in 40 minutes or so, which is great because especially as the game delivers depth and variety.

This one is an easy game which makes it great to play with my little one (6yrs).  He enjoys pulling Jewels out of the mine and selling them for pounds.  He is usually the one to put the most money for the queen especially toward his last turn before game end scoring :) Plays fast.  Good family game.

I purchased this game because it is heavy on dice and dice games are the favorite of some of my children.  The mechanics of the dice remind me of how the dice in Yspahan are used, but still, the mechanics are not the same.  Since the roll of the dice has more to do with what you do on your turn, and how many actions you might get, than it does with lucky combinations of the roll, my daughter was not thrilled with the game.  I enjoyed it more than she did.
     It is a fast little game with nice components and easy rules.  At this time it is listed as best with 2 players--I disagree.  I didn't like the 2-player game rule that everyone had to pay more homage in the treasure chest than the roll of the die.  I prefer the rule used for more players that eliminates the player who paid the least to the treasure chest/Queen Victoria. This I believe, results in harder choices, and makes the game a little more cut throat.  In a two player game there is never a need to donate more 24 coins, unless you think you need extra as a tie breaker.  The 2-player rule is more child-oriented and therefore might also be used in a lower-key family game.

15 mins with 2.  Often hard choices to make.

A very light-weight, quick game with seriously beautiful components. I can see this being a great first game for any game night. I've only played it 2-player so far and that wasn't bad at all, though I can see filling up the players making it more challenging. 

I was surprised that the MSRP for this was only $40 considering the quality of the components!

UPDATE: A FANTASTIC 5-player game! I may never bother with just 2 again. It really changes up and is a lot more variable and fun.

Interesting dice drafting.  House ruled the money as 1vp a piece, scored at endgame, and you can only bank an amount each round equal to the highest die you took(in that round) and the most money at the end gets +5vp.  Quick enough to be enjoyable for what it is.

RATING: 6
An inventive dice game with beautiful graphics and streamlined rules. Two things bother me:

1) I don't like in games when you are excluded from the fight when you didn't fulfil a certain secret condition.

2) The cost of acquiring the cards is pretty high and yet the randomness decides whether you can use them at all.

Apart of these two gripes the games is fun. Plain and simple.

RATING: 6
Standard Eurofare, but nicely constructed.  I enjoyed the first outing, with reminders of Yspahan and Thebes in gameplay.  Yes it is a construction of mechanisms, but it it does it well, and will get some play.  If you can handle the luck element of Thebes you'll have no problems here.  Lovely bits too.  What is not so lovely is the title - I can handle the theme of camping in Africa collecting gems - but it has nothing to do with Livingstone.

Uh-oh, 2nd play with 5p it dragged.  The players were partly to blame, but with players tending to hold cards the few that are left in the deck can keep whizzing around - like the back up the boat one, extending the game heaps.  Stick with less than 5.

This is a very nice family euro.  The board is gorgeous, the bits top notch, wonderful gems, thick card stock, treasure chests, and wooden tents and ship.  The game play is unique in that players draft dice which determine the actions and relative value of the actions players can take.  It's a neat unique use for dice where "low" rolls aren't necessarily bad.  Just use that 1 to build a low value camp, but might be worth big points at end game, or draw gem or card both of which could be very valuable.  Plays in about 30 minutes or less with 2 players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting mix of area control and dice rolling. It uses a mechanic similar to Yspahan to distribute the dice among players. Each player has many options on how to use the die they select on their turn.

I liked the idea of it, but the luck of the draw for both cards and gems takes it down a bit in my opinion. I don't have anything against luck in games, but I think it is too large a factor here.

RATING: 4
A neat gem of a game. Decisions are meaningful, but never overly serious. Dice drafting to choose actions all lead to different ways to either get money or points. To compete as winner, you must have secretly placed enough money in your chest throughout the game. There is a nice balance between ensuring you have invested enough for the future and spending the money now for points. Light and a pleasant way to close or open the game session.

An OK dice-euro, that, for me, had a vague feeling of Yspahan, where you are choosing actions based on what dice are available from a communal pool... with an area control element and action cards. Here you have the added 'paying tribute' mechanism (like the corruption in Cleopatra), such that the person who paid the least cannot win.

I liked Yspahan more, so I can't see myself playing this very much.

RATING: 3.5
Too much luck even for a light and quick family game. The dice mechanic seems clever at first glance, but in practice it really plays itself. There are some agonizing choices in what to do with them, but which die to select is usually obvious. The best thing about the game is the artwork by Michael Menzel.

This is an OK-to-good family game with cool components, but I can see why many gamers don't like it: The dice/action mechanic that's at the core of the game can result in a player losing a turn (well, technically getting only one action instead of two) through no fault of their own, which is a thing that most BGGers really dislike. There's also a significant amount of luck, which I myself welcome in a family game (gives the kids a chance).

I am dropping this a hole point for the horrifying application of theme.  Livingston was a great figure of the 19th century, and Stanley's epic travels to find him are the stuff of legend.  Unfortunately, Schmidt takes that legend into a bizzare new direction.  It seems Livingston wasn't serving a more noble calling from God, but rather searching for gems.  Well, aren't we all?

The thing is, a rudimentary knowledge of colonial history would have suggested an obvious and appropriate alternative to Livingston -- Rhodes.  Suddenly you switch the clear "diamond" pieces to be the most valuable, and you have a game that ALMOST fits its theme.

Alas alack, instead we have a lack luster Euro with a theme that actually denigrates its object.  Nice work, Schmidt.

Family game.  It has lots of luck, but it's still fun for me.
Nonethless I possess too many good family games to keep this one.
I can play it as a pure filler if someone suggests.

One of the very few euro-games with the prominent role of dice, which I can tolerate.  The use of regular dice here is possibly the most original one I've ever seen.

Be warned: _very_ dry game.

various luck factors (drawing gem's, drawing action cards, dice rolls may give last player in turn order only 1 action, etc etc).  add to that the hidden info with the stowing away money in the treasure chests and can see why this is considered much more a family game than a gamer's game.

Livingstone plays pretty quickly, and I have yet to work out what the best tactics are.  It's not something I will rush to play, but it's a solid choice and I'll play it ahead of some other games in my collection.

I could go either way on this game.  On the plus side, the pieces and artwork are nice (though very samey, typical Menzel style) and the theme is somewhat different, though still kind of typically pasted-on.  The rules are very simple and easy to teach, and the choices are interesting, since you never really know what is best.

However, the spark of fun is not really there.  It can be really frustrating at times, though maybe it's because of poor play.  It really is difficult to get a good pull of gems out of the bag, so there can be huge swings of luck there.  The cards are somewhat balanced, though the right card at the right time can make a huge difference.  The dice mechanism is kind of silly.  I guess that's supposed to be the hook, but there is a way that the final player in turn order can get very easily messed around, only getting one action while everyone else gets two.  I guess as long as the game goes quickly enough (and it is fairly quick), I don't have a problem with it.

I loved Livingstone as much as I expected to: it's a great game. Despite having quite a bit going on, it's easy to explain; even if it sounds confusing, it makes sense after just one turn.

The various ways in which it introduces and mitigates luck and chance (and, in some cases, doesn't mitigate them) are fascinating and entertaining, and I've never played a game where one person gets eliminated based on a non-primary objective at the end. (In our first game the score-winner got eliminated for being the donation-loser.)

---

Two years without a play makes this an easy sell, as nifty as it is. Sold.

The components are fantastic, too: gorgeous board, nice cards, great artwork, quality coins, a big fun bag of stones, and of course the nifty little treasure chests. Like Stone Age, the components help make the whole play experience just plain feel better.

This seems like a perfect game for non-gaming friends and family, too -- it hits a real sweet spot of play length, innovation, and pure fun.

Two downsides: the VP score chips are much too large for the board, making it look like you might have accidentally nudged them off the correct score, and the board is about a third too small.

Many people have commented on the scoring track.  I think this could have been easily solved had they swapped out the discs for cubes.  The track is fine the size it is, it is the size of the counters that causes all the issues.

Attractive components.  Chests seem printed wrong though.

Typical eurogame.  I like the strategy of selecting dice and also the spatial strategy of which grid spaces to explore.

What is with hiding the money, and also the cave-ins?  This makes mining gems practically infeasible as a viable play.  Taking money instead is always more reliable and just as lucrative in the long run.

Sounds like a pretty good fit. Good with 2 players and lighter/quicker to play.

You are placing huts as you explore. You also mine and have to pay 'taxes' to the Queen (the player with the lowest number of coins cannot win, even if they have the most VPs).  

Downside: memory of coins placed.

A lot more going on than it looks at first glance.  Five-year-old gets it fine - though it's tough to pass up reaching into the bag to see what you come up with...even if it may not be the best decision.  Nice components - gems and coin box in particular.

RATING: 6.5
A lightweight with quirks, but doesn't add up to much. The rule that whoever banks the least amount of money is disqualified from a win is a lazy way to curb over-investment. The gem-drawing strategy loses its luster early on once the desirable gems are drawn. It's pleasant enough, not conducive to AP, and plays quickly.

RATING: 3
Didn't like it right from the explanation of rules, a mixture of several luck-dependent components. Great: Each player is Livingstone (a scot), the player that donates the least gold to the Queen loses regardless of accumulated victory points. I guess, Livingstone would have chosen this loser as best incarnation of himself ...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
First impression (3 players): After reading the rules game felt ok but it soon turned out to be rather silly. Dice mechanic is pretty clever and is the best part of the game. With just 3 players the rule that one who donated least will lose is quite harsh. On the other hand with 4+ players this will be most likely too chaotic. Endgame is silly as you may hoard cards and then play many of them in sequence. There are some killer combinations that can literally win you the game at the last turn(s). As a final insult the score marker is too big for the score track!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An abstract family game with a pretty nifty turn system but quite a bit of rough edges.

The treasure chest is a completely separate kludge without any real connection to the other parts of the game; I'd rather ditch that completely. Trying to fix the overall dryness of the gameplay by adding very powerful card combos does not feel quite right either. The gem bag does not seem to reset quite often enough, at least with four players; This makes the bag action a lot less useful for long periods of time. The scoring tokens do not fit on the track, and the track is not divisible by ten.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It's easy to see why Livingstone is rapidly becoming a cult favourite. There are puzzle-solving elements reminiscent of Puerto Rico, groupthink-screwage like Caylus, economic calculations lifted from the likes of Dominion, and an optimisation challenge reminiscent most of St Petersburg. The whole thing is more than a little reminiscent of Yspahan, but with a sizeable chunk more screwage. Crucially, it doesn't really seem to reach the heights of any of those great games, but the short playing time is a boon nevertheless.

Further Thoughts: it seems like the randomness in the cards make it a little too easy to force a win through early pick-ups. Downgraded from 8 to 7 while I test this theory.

Further Further Thoughts: Made redundant entirely when I picked up Yspahan and realised it was the same thing done better. Downgraded from 7 to 6 and traded.

A super short well balanced game! I like it...it has so many fun elements to keep you interested! Upon further plays I find that this game is pretty strategic. A good family game that is simple to learn and easy to play! The gems and treasure chests are really awesome silly fun! The gems are worth the trouble to collect, the black ones may be worth zero money, but they bring victory points at game end...well unless someone digs the white stone out of the bag and all gems are returned to the bag! The card, gems, money, tents and dice mechanics are all integrated together in a nice way that really works...fun!

We now play this game outdoors...for some reason this makes it even more fun to play!

That is fun.  It is a unique mix of mechanics that is better than I expected.  A 4-player learning game lasted about an hour which is perfect.  There's some luck for killer cards that are drawn at the exact right time, but you have to choose to use otherwise useful actions to get those cards too.  

This will be playable with my kids, and the game pieces and board are awesome looking.  I'm pleased we chanced into this.

This is a game with some fun ideas and some nice components that breaks down in two places. The most important piece, is that the player at the end of the game with the fewest dollars auto-loses regardless of his points from the entire game. The other problem is there is a pulling gems from a bag mechanic that's fun, but is worse than any other action you could take.

Where were you all my life, Livingstone?!?!???! This rating is unstable, but likely to go up.

To play with two people, I highly recommend the following variant, due to Devon Harmon:

Use the rules as written, but give both players 3 coins to start, and use a collective pool of FIVE dice. Yes, this means that the person choosing first might get more than the other guy, but each player has the same number of opportunities to get 3 dice. This ramps up the tension a hundred-fold. Just try it. It is amazing.

A mish mash of mechanics makes up a mildly interesting family fare. With three players it seems there's all too much of actions, money and points.

I enjoyed this game much more than I was anticipating; it reminded be of a light variation of [b]Thebes[/b] (one of my favorites).

It's not bad, but really nothing too special either. I do like that you have to be careful in the order in which you take your actions to ensure that you can use both of your dice and certainly there is a press-your-luck element to drawing jewels out of the bad that is fun. Nevertheless, it's fairly light and not super compelling, but won't mind playing from time to time.

A nice blend of mechanisms with an exploration theme:
- dice rolling like Yspahan, with a twist: roll 2d6 per player; on your turn, you choose one of the dice but it must have more pips than your last-chosen die
- multiple options for using die/pips:
... 1 gold/pip
... all pips for 1 card
... 1 gem/pip (out of bag, like Thebes -- lots of useless rocks in there, too!)
... build a tent in the row specified by d6, and active column (advance to right each turn; game ends when get to last column). These cost gold (less early in game) and score VP right away (=pips) as well as at end of game (for each row/pip number 1-6, player with majority scores 14-2n VP)
- any time on your turn, donate gold into cleverly made treasure box; at end of game, player who donated least cannot win (like Cleopatra Society of Architects)

The randomness of the cards and dice is not so bad. Like Thebes, though, the randomness of drawing from the bag -- while thematic, perhaps (there's really not a lot of theme here) -- is a little annoying.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It's not a bad game. It has some good decisions to make although it could have a bit too much luck involved. It's still a solid design with very good components (despite the round scoring discs don't fit very well on the VP grid) and it plays very quick in about 30/45 minutes.

A pure family euro game also good for newbies.

It should be played with the certain spirit, like not too seriously or too slow. Decisions are almost the same every turn, it plays very straight forward with the dice rolling and picking the best thing this game has. It's an interesting way to use dice in a kind of new mechanic - at least for me. Basic choices are constructing a hut, taking stones from the bag or picking a card. Huts are essential to get points. Stones are a good although risky way to get money. Cards are very different in value, some are really good and some are absolutely innocuous. A simple fun mechanic is a blind donation that can prevent a player from winning - the player whom at the end of the game has donated less money to the patron is not able to win. This adds an interesting blind, bluffing characteristic to the game that I like.

lovely shiny plastic stones, very nice cardboard, treasure chests, board and cards uninspired art work.
 
A little bit of Thebes, a tiny bit of area majority. Dice. Choices. Nice balance between short term Vps and long term. 

I like it, choice of dice requires some calculation  as you can be left only having one action in a round. The mining is mot quite as frustrating as Thebes as the treasure is refilled in the round and 'hoarders' get punished.

The cards appear  well balanced - i  especially like the ability to move the scoring column back one (or not).

Filler, might not be an ideal family game, certainly good with gamers. Quite likely move to  a 7.

On the cotnrary after a few games it's a family game not a gamers game. too  much randomness for gamers. Great with children who love the gems

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light, quick, but with a bit more luck than most strategy gamers are accustomed to, this is fun game for families and those not looking to strain too much. There are still plenty of interesting decisions to be made. How can you best draft your dice to benefit yourself and hinder your opponents? Do you go for short term or long term points with your tent placements? Do you fish for a card that can boost your points, cash, or throw a wrench in your opponents quest for tent domination? Do you take the safe money or fish in the gem bag for a potential wind-fall?

If this were a long game, I might not like it, but it's an excellent fit of weight to game length. It doesn't hurt that the components are quite nice as well.

This may be the best of all possible worlds. If you win, it's easy to credit your incredible strategy. If you lose... well it was just bad luck!

RATING: 5
Forgettable dice-driven area influence game. Players roll a number of dice and select one to use for actions such as obtaining money, searching the mine, obtaining an action card for further options, and placing a tent on the board for victory points. The lower the value of the dice selected the less powerful the action you can take, but it does allow for further actions, which is where the game's main decision process takes place. The one area of the game that introduces some unpredictability and tactical play is the necessity to make financial donations to the queen. These are done in secret and obviously make obtaining victory points more difficult as you require money to place tents for VPs. This is a critical aspect of the game because whoever has made the smallest donation is unable to win the game. Other than that though 'Livingstone' doesn't really make for an interesting experience. It's part of the publisher's 'Gateway Games' series but there are far better introductions to Euro gaming than this.

Livingstone es un eurogame en toda regla que utiliza la vida de David Livingstone como excusa para crear un juego que parece ser bastante dinámico.

El sistema de acciones mediante tiradas de dados es lo que me ha parecido más interesante. Me recuerda un poco al de Yspahan, pero muchísimo más sencillo, depurado y elegante.

También tiene un elemento de forzar la suerte, al extraer piedras preciosas de la mina (una bolsa llena de cristales de plástico), que en el fondo es lo de siempre, pero que me gusta por el componente de emoción que añade a las partidas.

Otra mecánica que me gusta como han integrado en el juego es la de las Donaciones a la reina, aunque es casi igual a los puntos de corrupción en Cleopatra y la sociedad de arquitectos: el jugador que menos dinero haya donado a la reina es eliminado de la partida, incluso aunque por puntos fuera el ganador.

A ver si en mi próximo viaje a Alemania me lo traigo de vuelta, porque no parece muy caro ni muy grande. Por el momento, y hasta que lo haya podido conseguir y jugar y hablar de él con más conocimiento, os dejo a continuación el reglamento traducido al español:

I think this is a wonderful gateway game for children to move into euro-style games.  My daughter, 6, is so proud that she can follow this game.  We leave the cards out for her because of the amount of thought they take.  What could be better than little treasure chests, gold and gems plucked secretly from a bag.  She may not understand the scoring, but she did pretty dang well.

Livingstone is a buffet of mechanisms you'll recognize from other games, but it never transcends the sum of its parts.  However, Livingstone could also define "Euro-filler."

The score markers don't even fit.

Interesting little game like a cross between Yspahan, Oregon and Thebes.  I like having the dice create a random situation each turn with the game play being in how you choose to deal with that situation; better with more players so there's more dice and therefore more choices available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An interesting blend of euro-mechanics, but ultimately disappointing because a few lucky draws can lend to a runaway leader problem.

Also, players are required to pay favor to the Queen throughout the game, as they see fit. Whoever is in last at the end of the game, automatically loses. The punishment is absolute. In a two player game, its worse, as the two players have to beat a dice roll...so, you play a full game, roll the dice, and just like that you can both lose. A surefire way to make the experience of a game feel pointless.

Luck in the dice rolling, luck in the card drawing, and more luck in the gem pulling. A bit too long for this much luck.

Bought as a two-fer from Tanga as a gateway game.  It's been pretty well received, but don't believe the 35 minute playing time.  We've never finished a four/five player game in less than an hour and a half.

Also, the English rules are highly ambiguous and don't appear to have covered some of the original rules from the original German.

In this game you follow in the footsteps of David Livingstone to the roaring Victoria Falls. On your way you may want to try your luck in the Diamond mining or you may prefer to seek a more calculable risk.

A light game with a nice dice mechanic which involves a little luck and a little strategy. Doesn't take long to have your turn and gives you just enough to think about while others have their turn. It plays out in roughly 45 minutes (depending on player count) which is a big plus. The game is mostly about acquiring enough coins to buy tents while making sure you have given away enough of your money to the queen so that you keep her favour. Simples!

Some fun. The pick up of hiden gems in the bag reminds me Thebes. Too random for me. I don't hate random if it is associated with probability.

I need a 'BLACK stone'.

Well, yes, it needs a few 'tweeks'. The scoring tokens are too big. There are too many 'black' stones. The grid lines are hard to see. No player screens to hide the money. It drags on a bit, with more than three players. We really enjoy the dice drafting mechanic; it's quite ingenious. Our End-game: The most generous donor gets 5 VP, however, everyone is still required to make a donation at some point during the game, to have their points counted. The best strategy for this bonus: save up a pile of your coins and plop 'em all in, on the last turn... relish the looks of consternation in your opponents's faces. Credit: Kathy.

One underwhelming play.  The art is fantastic, and the components are good, but otherwise this is nothing special.  The exploration theme is pretty thin, and the mechanics feel shallow.  The dice aspect of the game is not especially great, and was done much better in other games, notably [gameid=22345]. You can do worse for a lightish Euro, but you can also do a lot better.

I really enjoy this game.  It's a good family-weight game that lasts about the right length of time for what it is.  I love the "donation to the Queen" mechanism that will elimate you from the game if you hold back money from Her Royal Highness!

Lovely components, but the game isn't as good as I had hoped. You roll 2 dice per person, then choose a die and do an action, usually using the number on the die as part of your action. Use a rolled 4 for money, get $4. Use a rolled 6 to place your tent, place it on the 6 row, which gives more points than the 5 row, etc. The dice choosing mechanism promises to be interesting in that you always have to take a dice higher than the one you last chose this turn. However, in practice for two players, this wasn't, because it was obvious how the choosing would go. The first player would look and think "If I take the 2, then the other player will take this, leaving me with a second 2 that I can't use, so therefore I have to take the 4..." There's also a mechanism where the player who donates the smallest amount of cash to the Queen during the game is automatically eliminated, and this also doesn't work too well in two players, as both players could lose the game on a high dice roll. I think it would be better in 2 players to simply have the player who donated the most get a specific number of points, or perhaps get the difference in donations as points.

Sold after one more try.

This should be the defacto gateway game.  Simple rules, fun to play, except for the lowest donater elimination, but that has been house-ruled away

Even our second game, when everybody knew the rules, took over an hour and half, and that is too much for a game like this. 30 to 45 minutes as the box said would be quite right, but I don't know how it can be done. The game itself appears to be quite simple, there are some cards to give more options and the amount of dice give a nice touch of randomess, but still there is something, that I just don't get. Not a game for me, too long and too boring.

I would recommend the game; 'Livingstone', I presume (!), regarding that fantastic old Victorian tradition of invading, sorry, enlightening the misguided natives (played on Monday evening this week instead of 'Star Wars' RPG.
All in the name of altruism (profit). Each player takes on the role of a European whitey explorer, who may use dice selection to undertake several options, like build a camp, sell gems, take a card or take some money equal to dice score.
It is a very cleverly balanced game where players must balance the short term victory gains in camp placement on the gridded board in each line against the longer game objective of scoring for the greatest number of camps on a row.
BGG will show what the board looks like so the context should be clear. It is worth noting that players must also send monies back to Queen Vic to encourage her patronage towards them upon their return. The lowest money sent back excludes that player from winning!
DJ and I played with one of our role-playing friends, and they would have won on 76 victory points, but for this rule, so DJ with 70 won, and I was second with a good old 69! I did send back the most money so at least I won most loyal subject award.....
There was only one KRO, generated by poorly written rules to be fair, albeit there were only two sections where this was evident. There are two dice rolled for each player on each game turn. Now comes the clever part.
Players select dice but cannot take a dice lower or equal to what they previously took as each tries to vie for the best combination of scoring dice. Higher numbers mean placement higher up the vertical grid and more victory points.
It also means more chances to draw better quality gemstones or take more coins, one of the other actions allowable, but selecting lower dice may get you more dice than an opponent. It may also prevent an opponent from having more than one dice with three or fewer players.
Very tactical, too, as we all 'did one' (of these) to one another along the way. We did play the first few turns with all ten dice, (being a two to five player game) since the rules did say 'use all the dice' when it should have said according to the number of players * two.
Good entertainment. No slavery included.....

I actually really like some of the mechanics of this game. It has more luck than say Stone Age, but I'm okay with that. I love the fact that you can be eliminated if you don't contribute enough to the queen. That and the dice selection process, make this game interesting for me. The components are also very neat.

I knew going in that there would not be that much "game" in Livingstone. At least there are some decisions to be made here and I have something other to suggest in place of Afrikan tähti or Inkan aarre for younger gamers.

RATING: 4
Too random:
- Value of the cards can be quite different.
- Drawing gems gives you on average 1.1 money per draw - but we had somebody pulling out 18 money with 5 dice, another player 0. Usually, you need to spend an action to get 4-6 gold.

The treasure chects are very beautiful made, and completely useless. There is no point at all to put in any money until the last turn.

Rating further downgraded after more plays

Smooth, uncomplex, moderate theme.  It's a great game to play with kids, and decent to play with non-gamers.  The goals of the game only peripherally relate to Livingstone's life, but decent game nonetheless.

In a game that is far too long for its own good, the inclusion of cards that can actually extend the number of game turns is a terrible idea.

Livingstone also has "draw from the bag" randomness (in the vein of Thebes) that is knee-slapping fun when someone gets burned, but isn't good for much else.

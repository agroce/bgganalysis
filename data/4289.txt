RATING: 7.5
I have owned this game for quite a while now and really do like the level of detail for the armoured combat, but must admit that the infantry rules are a little lacking in comparison.  But if your looking for a tank on tank Game then 88 or Panzer or Armor is a great system.

Ótimo jogo tático de combates na Africa do Norte, entre 1941 e 1943. As regras foram baseadas em jogos de miniaturas. Jogo antigo mas muito bom.

Com os 3 jogos da série: Panzer, 88 e Armor, é possível jogar em qualquer teatro da Segunda Guerra Mundial na Europa e na África.

O sistema foi revisado pela GMT e já está disponível, ver a série Panzer (GMT).

Sorry I sold this one.  Good series.  Have the others.  Only comparison I can think of is Tobruk.  I liked 88 better.  We also used the system with micro armor, which worked quite well.

Part of the Yaquinto tactical trilogy made up of 88, Armor and Panzer.

During a game session you have the impression to fight at rallenty. A lot of details to be controlled, a lot of dice roll... it takes too much time.

Too a complex game, also compared with Squad Leader. I don't like games where armor thickness has greater relevance than tactics.

RATING: 5
I think this is the only game that I've owned twice and sold twice... I think on the premise that it was "better than Tobruk" (which I still own for some reason).

RATING: 7
The detail in this game is unreal! The vehicle cards contain the armour on every part of the vehicle. The simultaneous movement really works for me making you second guess your opponent. This is however an extremely complex game and especially when your starting out you can get a little bogged down with the rules.

88, Panzer and Armor...my first real wargame system. I still like to play these after 20 some years.

Q: How much of your rating is nostalgia based?

A: I think that "very little" is the correct answer. Yes, it was a good time in my life when I was playing alot of this but I still enjoy it very much today.

Q: If not nostalgia then why do you like it so?

A: I have always enjoyed the concept of armored vehicle warfare ever since I was pushing around little green tanks and men on the living room floor. Yeah, I still do that but I meant in a nongame related way.

This series focuses on armored conflict in detail. The rest of the WWII battlefield components are present, however, they are either abstracted a bit or streamlined to keep the armor as the lead element.

This is an excellent, incredibly well researched game.  I played a lot of this when it first came out.  For a while, it displaced SL from my table until ASL appeared.  The only limitation for me was the plotting of movement which made large scenarios impractical.

RATING: 8
An alternative to the complexity of ASL and its desert rules, '88' is a playable, armor-oriented game which covers the North African theater in a fraction of the rules that ASL requires. Fun, fast-playing and exciting. Sister to Panzer and Armor games.

Great set of miniatures rules.  Very detailed and maybe time has passed this one by.  Many fond memories and nostalgia though.

Enjoyed this game as a child - also Armour and 88. May introduce my son to them - simultaneous programmed moves, quite easy to play I seem to remember.

RATING: 9.5
Among the best games I have ever played, (though I am an admitted Desert Campaign fanatic). Like the other games in the series, Armor and Panzer, this feels like a thorough research study of tank capabilities with a game attached, (approve!). Why did the Italians fair so poorly in 1940?...set up a scenario and watch it happen. Point system scenario generation provides variety and play balance. Historicity vs. gameability dovetail impressively in these games. This one goes in my casket.

I used to have this one as a kid and really enjoyed it. Somewhere I have a picture of friends playing the game from around 1980. Very detailed tank battles. I remember finding that there was an awful lot of firing back and forth with few hits and few armor penetrations; which was probably fairly realistic. The armor in this game was more early war, and on the light-medium side. Would love to pick up a nice copy.

EDIT; Finally found a nice minty unpunched copy on eBay for $54.

Played this a few times when it came out. My friend loved it. I wasn't as keen on it as Tobruk or Panzerblitz.

This is extremely complex, as I recall. My teenage brain had already absorbed Squad Leader and Air War, and I was afraid it might burst if I tried to learn this one, too. I have barely even opened the box since then. I remember liking the terrain hexes, the variety of units and the high level of detail. But the little turret counters looked to be extremely fiddly. I am not as fond of desert warfare games as I was in my youth.

GREAT system. Desert version of Panzer and Armor. Very much a miniatures game using cardboard. Terrain features could be placed on the map, cards for the tanks and troops, guns and weapons. Exciting!

Battlefront on PC made these obsolete.

LOT's of fond memories of this game. Bad infantry rules, but of course this series WASN'T about the infantry...It was about the ARMOR and an attempt to treat every angle and possible effect the hit has on the armored vehicles.. As a young guy I thought it fascinating and always wanted to see how the tanks did against each other with plenty of Fantasy battle combinations....

Complex. As with most games of this complexity, it helps to have a good memory. Very cool desert tank battles. Loads of fun. Tactics are waaaay more important than armor thickness, but a little extra steel never hurt anyone. IMO, not as rule bound as Squad Leader, even the original. Nice thick counters, they can even be picked up with fat fingers easily. Slow at first like anything else, except our favorite tactical game, hehe. You will develope your favorite tank and position, yes, still talking about 88. I would trade for more fun stuff, or bundle it up with more for a wish list game.~~~~~~~I know have one that is like new and unpunched nice new crisp cards lookingk mighty fine. This has become a seller or a keeper. Big offers alway help make my mind up.

I own 88 and Armor, but have no gamers to play against. I have a nice case full of Micro armor as well. Probably a 100 pieces, most painted. The best scenario was three of us all going for a share of the gold hidden in a desert canyon. Over 14 vehicles got wiped out. A disabled Panzer iv held two of us off while a Valentine stole away with half of the fortune. My damn wife figured half was better than none. She won. It was a hell of a game.

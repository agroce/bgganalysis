Playing with the version 2.0 rules. I've pre-ordered the upcoming Gettysburg game, LCV, so obviously I like the system. I have a few quibbles with it, basically disagreements with Dean Essig's design philosophy as outlined by a couple other commenters here, but nevertheless it was (mostly) just what I was looking for--a realistic seeming Civil War tactical system with individual regiments as the main components.  I really love pushing around the 28th Ohio and the 79th New York and so on.  

The LOB rules seem to handle "defensive fire" issues better than what I've heard about the RSS system, as the designer says he intended. Units running across a field to attack don't take much in losses, and will often inflict heavier losses on their first shot against the defender, but almost inevitably in the next half-turn other defending units will make that attacker pay.

The Line of Battle system is the definitive treatment at the regimental scale. I've played and completed the entire campaign of this and it was the most epic gaming experience I've had in my life.

This is the first game in Dean Essig's new evolution of ACW games - Line of Battle.  Still waiting to get a game in before I rate it, but I think it will surpass the RSS as my preferred set of rules.

The first game of the Line of Battle (LoB) series of regimental American Civil War games.  By far the best rendition of this battle.  Highly recommended.

Too much detail, cluttered map and an insane SOP with constant die-rolling for little effect ... recommended only if you missed out on the re-enactment. Otherwise look for a real "game".

I've played this just once, the Sunken Road scenario (4.3).  It flowed along very nicely and was much smoother than the original RSS rules.  However, I think it will take a larger scenario to show the real impact of the new rules, which do not allow you to easily withdraw once you've moved into enemy ZOCs.

I really like the new LOB system. I'm playing NBH with Version 2, and it is an excellent refinement of the first version. The Command system is easy to use and really deepens the narrative of the game when your own orders are out there struggling to make it across the battlefield to their destination. Finally, I think the 'Opening Volley' method of addressing defensive fire is not only simple, but is effective as a sim component. The evidence of how very hard the designer worked on this game is apparent throughout.

RATING: 9
The Line of Battle system is absolutely brilliant (note: I haven't tried its ancestors CWB or RSS). As a model of regimental-scale American Civil War combat, it produces exciting simulations that, to me, really capture the chaos and grind of ACW battles and produces great narratives. You constantly struggle to keep your units doing what you want them to do, despite fluke attack stoppage, cowardly legs (higher likelihood of retreating when their neighbors retreat), and ever-worsening morale. The system is excellent and I find myself thinking about it when I'm playing other games.

The rules (I play with LoB v2) are relatively straight-forward and the short scenarios do a great job of introducing you to the core of the game before adding extra problems like fluke stoppage. It's only unfortunate that the short scenarios don't really give the opportunity to learn the orders system, which only really comes into play in the campaign scenarios. 

Some people say they have trouble with line-of-sight rules, especially given that the map contours do not align to the hex grid. The key is to not think of the contour lines as "layered cake", but as elevation lines as you would see on an actual survey map, which show the rate at which the elevation changes by varying the distance between the lines. Mentally pictured that way, it becomes very easy to imagine the landscape and "eyeball" LoS obstructions.

With all of this in mind, None But Heroes provides, then, a very detailed look at the Battle of Antietam/Sharpsburg. This was a singularly bloody battle, and your play-throughs will see similar results. You will see just how much of a meatgrinder the fight for the Sunken Road was. You will get a feeling for just how vital the reinforcements from A.P. Hill's division were, and even how things would have been different if Hill took an alternative route to the battle that would have been an easier march (giving him stronger units upon arrival). 

A note for the space-deprived: there are 4 one-map scenarios (the Sunken Road scenario is on two maps but uses only a small portion of both, so can be played in the space of a one-mapper) and 4 two-map campaign scenarios. The one-mappers are still very interesting and some of them will definitely take a long time to play through. So it's absolutely worth it even if you can't play the two-mappers.

RATING: 9
Based on my first solo playing of the very short Charge of the Texas Brigade scenario.  MMP's Line of Battle regimental system is simpler and smoother than either GMT's GBACW system or MMP's own RSS/CWR system.  The flavor and feel of the new system is better than that of RSS/CWR (where fire has its own phases and close combat/shock/charging almost never works) and more akin to GMT's GBACW (where movement and fire are integrated and close combat/shock/charging works well when the numbers, leadership and morale is there). Moreover, the new system  achieves this without the fiddliness that accompanies some of  GBACW's mechanisms.

It will interesting to try some of the other small to medium sized scenarios.

RATING: 9
One ofthe best simulation of Civil War Tactics ever designed. While the rules are still in flux, Version 2.0 Beta works as both a simulation and a playable game. The streamline combat system is both easier and more realistic than the older RSS system. While I had a few issues  at first(with the vulnarbility of artillery and weakness of defense) I defer to the designers knowledge and accept the game as is...

Antietam creek near the town of Sharpsburg. None but Heroes is the first game in the new Line of Battle Series. With Dean;s design reputation, it is almost sold to me instantly. As usual, the game receives favorable comments from the wargamers as it is released initially.

The smoothness and clarity of the Line of Battle rules reflect three decades of experience across four related game systems by designer Dean Essig.  The movement and battle subsystems are amazingly simple in practice, although described in typical Essig detail.  The command rules do an excellent job of simulating the era (idiots talking to amateurs though a com channel limited to the bandwidth of a horse) with a minimum of overhead.  There is a lot of nice weapon-trait chrome, made simple by well laid out player aid cards.  Overall, you get a lot of simulation realism with little fuss to get in the way of the game.

Elegant game design from Dean Essig. He has the ability to capture the essence of the battlefield with clean mechanics that focus on the right sort of decisions for players to make.  I was somewhat cool on the Civil War Brigade Series and I was not attracted to the regimental games based on that series until the Line of Battle rules came along in this game (they can be retrofitted to the earlier regimental games seamlessly - which is how to play This Terrible Sound).

An intricate system that aims to model the vagaries of the command structure to shape play. The best laid plans of the best can go eerily wrong at the worst of times.

Worth spending the time to get to know the system before tackling the full games.

In addition to the big campaign game there are some excellent smaller scenarios, the first two of which provide a very programmed approach to learning the system.

My rating of this game has significant up-side potential. That potential will be realised when I get to play the full game.

While playing one discovers that the game isn't really that complicated as the rulebook suggests and things develop quite smooth. I would give this game more than 7.5 if it wasn't for some fiddly rules about LOS and a general odd feeling about the rulebook organization.

I was involved in early playtesting of this game and series. I haven't played the final product, but I read the series rules and the game rules. 

Normally, I would rate this a 9+. Circumstances dictate a perfect 10. Thanks Smjj.

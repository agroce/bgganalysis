RATING: N/A
While over 90% of the game is present and virtually unused some of it was cannibalized for A World At War before I actually got that game. Mostly the Research stuff that applied to A3R. 
I put it here in case someone wants this for parts or can live with having to replace some of it.
Quite high on eBay.

Creates a good global campaign with Advanced Third Reich. Creates a good feel of Pacific campaign but naval air rules makes battles a bit too long.

A bit of a cumbersome game.  The system itself is not bad, but it seems like it could be made "leaner and meaner" to make a better game.  The map is outstanding, but if I want to play a grand strategy game of the Pacific, this down the way some on my list of options.

RATING: 3
Advanced Third Reich is a dreadful hack of a game, long and intensely complicated for no real purpose. And hey, what do you know, when you try and take a fairly mediocre game designed for the ETO and port it to the PTO more or less straight-up, you get something worse yet. As a PTO game, this has essentially nothing to recommend it. As an adjunct to A3R, maybe, but what would the point be?

RATING: 4
Historical Japanese expansion too unlikely.  Punishes bad luck even more than A3R.

Cool carrier battle system though - far more fun to resolve carrier battles than, say, Empire of the Sun, but that isn't saying much.

Amazingly complex.  I doubt anyone on earth is playing this anymore.

RATING: 10
The game is addressed to veterans of the hobby. A companion wargame to the ‘Advanced Third Reich’. It portrays military actions taken from 1936 to the end of 1945 in the Pacific Theater of WWII. Instead of using panzers like one does in the Western front, you use flat tops and fleets to ‘breakthrough’ enemy lines. The navy is the core of the game to attain superiority over the adversary and maintain your possessions. The game adds rules for research by using part of your resource points to achieve a technological breakthrough. Also it provides a small booklet to join the game with its companion and start a global war. Although a hard row to hoe, one can just by exploring ‘what-if’ situations gain satisfaction from this game.

Never liked the 3rd Reich system, though it had its big fans. I prefer tactical games to strategic ones. The 3rd Reich system has some quirky play to it. I sold this one after looking it over. I have tried the original 3rd reich before.

Take the Pacific war... add the rules for Third Reich... mix well.  Many don't like the 3R system and rate this game a lot lower... I think that it fits quite well and makes for a fascinating game.

Add Advanced Third Reich for a better experience than World in Flames.

Great work done for this game which resulted in the first ever 'A World at War' game, combing both A3R and ERS in to one massive game of WWII.  Excellent, and still a strong stand-alone game.

Advanced Third Reich on the Pacific theatre.  A proven wargame system being applied to a grand theatre. But to play a campaign game proves to be a daunting task which require several weekends to complete.

RATING: 5
Very clever carrier system layered over a base system that, no matter how much chrome is lathered on it, is no more suitable to fighting the war in the Pacific than it was in GDW's Pearl Harbor.  Seasonal turns and corps-level ground units just are not suited to the theatre at this map scale. As such, the technical achievement of incorporating said carrier system is the main reason not to rate it quite low.

A pretty long rulebook (too long), but still fairly playable.  The rules for carrier battles are actually really fun.  While the rulebook is too long, the game is fun if you take the time to learn it.  This game is included as the (revised) Pacific portion of "World at War".  But the rulebook for that edtion is much, much, longer.

Still waiting to play the game. I am missing the appendices for the game. I hope to get them soon through this site, but I would be gratefull to anyone who has the game and can send me a scanned version of the appendices.
Ultimate goal for me is to finally play the global version of WWII with Advanced Third Reich. 

Temporarily rated as a 9 because of my experience with ATR.

RATING: 7.5
Great game in its own right.  Advanced Third Reich types will notice that Carrier units are to the Pacific what Armor units are to Europe.  Even China has its own BRP card!  A rule book lawyers delight but well worth it.

RATING: 4
Seemed an accurate enough representation of the front, but added such complexity to the already complex Third Reich that it lost all playability for me.  I realize others will have embraced it...  I'm happy to just turn the Pacific over to MacArthur.

RATING: 5
A game that's perhaps too big for its own good.  The problem with the PTO is that it's hard to capture the vastness of the space while keeping sufficient life in the game.  I'd say EotRS suffers from this problem.  Long stretches with not much going on, coupled with a very dense rule set and many choices to make.

Perhaps this is best played with Advanced Third Reich to give the Americans something else to do and some additional hard choices to make - We've never had the time to make that happen.  And we probably won't - the game's just too long and unappealing to someone that's not a WWII nut to invest the time and energy in learning the rules, let alone mastering them.

A brave attempt to export the A3R system to the Pacific theater.  That said, the 3R / A3R system is not designed for naval battles and adding named carriers into general fleet don't mesh well and as such is rated lower than A3R in my views.  Blending with A3R with two naval combat systems for a global war is awkward.  Designers acknowledge the shortcomings and refine the game system in AWAW that becomes the definitive WW2 grand strategy game.

Companion to my all-time favourites. Added Research and carriers. Though, I have always favoured the ETO and considered the Pacific a backwater... bias, I admit, but for carier battles I play Flat Top. Still, GlobalWar scenario; I must have solitaired it dozens of times.

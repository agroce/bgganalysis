This is the only game I have ever sold...it's was that unenjoyable.  I kickstarted it and sold it after attempting to play it about 3 times. After the first attempt I started writing new rules. Literally two pages of rules rewrites. I managed to make the game a bit more fun, but by that point it was just too much to keep track of all the changes that need to be remembered. If you would like, I can provide the rules changes I wrote as a PDF, just message me.

Its very much an rpg-ish, ameritrashy game that's about the experience, as opposed to a euro strategy game.  That's neither good or bad, its just different.  (Though some people prefer it and some don't).  

I thought its main issue was that you had some really short turns like 'I camp - heal 2', that were done in 3 seconds, and then you would sit there and wait for another player to fight through several encounters in one turn, each one have a ton of die rolls with a complicated combat system.  

Basically it is a solo game where you can play it with other people and then just sit there doing nothing while they take their turns.  Every person you add to the game only adds more downtime.

It seemed like it took a long time to get your character going and manage to gain one stat point or find a good weapon.  An opponent looked for a good melee weapon all game and never found one.  I never got a good ranged weapon that I wanted, only a slight upgrade over the starting pistol.  We all got enough exp during the game to increase one stat by one, which didn't feel like much character progression at all.  

In the end while I like parts of it a lot, it had downtime and pacing issues, it felt like we spent 2 and a half hours playing and I barely got anywhere.  But I think fans of ameritrashy games with lots of time to kill will enjoy it.

Also, I think this would be a good solo game.  its main problem is that the extra players do nothing but add downtime, because you don't really interact with them.

A second game played and generated our own characters. Even playing the "shorter" version it lasted four hours with three players.  Hard to imagine cutting the time down much. In both our games we lost to the mutants.  Skipping the level 1 encoutners to speed the game on didn't seem to help gain a win.

Love the fate element of the game - possibility of turning  mutant. The stages of the game are simple, but where it get's seriously fucked up is the dice: 3 types - combat, melee and defense dice, and they are not the "normal" numbered ones either. Understanding the dice results proved to be beyond my current brain capacity and I owe endless gratitude to the dear boyfriend who always patiently explains all that to me. Maybe if I play more often I'll start digging it. 
Another downside - no proper miniatures, just fairly generic meeples. But hey, you can get minis from any other games you have.

RATING: 5.5
We kickstarted this, but I think it's disapointing. Played once with three players, where one player turned mutant to late in the game so we never saw how that worked out.
While playing this, I felt I was dragged through a history where I couldn't do strategigally choices to win. My choices was limited while much random was happening in dices and drawing from different card decks and a tile deck.
The game takes long time, and has lots of downtime when other players have combats. Before anyone turns mutant it's almost no interaction between the players, other than trading. 
It didn't help that the rules are written complicated, and we used much time looking up things.

The positive things to say is; nice graphics and very thematic.

Some interesting ideas in this game.  I really like the macro/micro level map stuff (and I wish more of the game revolved around this).  The game still feels like it could use more development.  The combat system feels clunky, and I wish there was a way for the players to resolve their encounters simultaneously as this would cut down in play-time siginificantly

Really loved the idea behind this one, almost backed the Kickstarter campaign and honestly I am glad I eventually didn't. The game is a monster of a game, simulating a PC game on tabletop. Lots of choices, some of them on the 'too much' side, prolonging the game with persnickety rules easy to miss and hard to intuitively remember. I wanted to like the game, it just fell short on the 'theme/fun vs complexity' scale.

It would be a much much better game if it weren't for two fundamental issues:

 - Melee is the most important stat in the game *by far*, probably followed by Mind.  This means that your chances of winning are already heavily determined by your character stats.  This also breaks character customization, because by pumping those two stats you get close to no variety in characters;  no one will want to make a good shooter because shooters are fundamentally weaker than good fighters.

 - Player interaction is fairly minimal, at least between players which haven't turned posthuman yet.  This may be less of an issue with more than 2 players.

Fun game, fiddly as all get out, and very well balanced it seems.  Pays to put more into melee than shooting and even if you turn it isn't a instant loss for everyone else as you are limited in your options.  Game I played came down to a single die roll on if the one player would win or become a mutant.  Great game.

I love the setting and the story that can come out of the game. Unfortunately, melee combat is a little clunky and the mutant system doesn't work quite as well as one would hope. Enjoyable solo play though, and one I don't mind holding on to.

A decent "AmeriTrash" dice chucker. Set up takes a little while inasmuch as there are a metric ton of cards. That's not a ding as this type of game almost requires it. The sheer volume of weapons, armor, and items possible to obtain over a single game is one of the many reasons I was drawn to it. 

Game-play is intense during your turn with some down time when it's not. The dice rule all and sometimes your luck fails, even when maxed out. Game-play makes a 180, however, if you mutate because you're actively hunting the other players every round.

This is not a game for the faint of heart. There are a lot of pieces that go into plussing up your dice-roll and victory is hard to come by (as a survivor). But the theme and good-old-fashioned dice chucking is extremely satisfying. Plus, there's a sense of accomplishment when successfully foraging supplies or defeating a mutant in a city. 

Overall, Posthuman is a fun, if complicated to learn, game that gets regular play these day. Once players figure out the various ins and outs, it's 60-90 minutes of dice flying and mutants dying.

Kickstarted.  Received mid-December.  

I was really looking forward to this game, but after a couple tries, I think I'm already about done with it.  My impression is that it is unnecessarily complicated (lots of components - fourteen decks of mini-cards and piles of tokens, fiddly player boards, confusing rules), long (at least one hour per player), entirely luck dependent (all about those dice and often hard-won card draws with highly random results) and incredibly difficult (there's a good chance you will be KO'd in a single encounter in the earliest zones).  

As humans, there isn't much player interaction at all, other than trades, assuming you ever get enough resources to even consider trading.  As mutants, you can play one card per turn to harass a human player (attack to do damage or steal items) in the hopes of knocking them out or "driving them to despair."  

Chances are very good that no one is going to win the game as a human by racing to the fortress, and that the mutants will "win" by default, just because the game is difficult on its own.  I guess that could be called thematic in a Posthuman world, but it feels very anticlimactic in the Posthuman game.

It is similar to Munchkin.
If you get lucky card draws, then you have options and fun. If you get unlucky draws, then you get to sit there bored and frustrated. Way too heavy of a game to put up with that.

Yeah so this kinda kills off Pathfinder adventure card game for me as it's basically the same type of game with card flipping and dice rolling.

But I like the character development of this one a lot more and each session has an end to it.
Mechanically it's more interesting a well and I'm a sucker for a post apoc theme.

I originally kickstarted, then backed out and a friend kickstarted it in my place. We played it once with 3-players and could barely keep our interest as the rules were ridiculously fiddly. Even so, I loved the theme and I wanted to give it another try.

We played again with 6-players, and everyone started off interested but 30 minutes in, we all just wanted it to end. Passing around one set of dice made encounters and combat drag, people would keep losing encounters and being sent back, melee was ridiculously powerful for some people but a death sentence for others...eventually everyone but me turned mutant, and I barely made it to the Fortress to win the game.

Everyone agreed that the last 15 minutes of the game, with all the other players trying to sabotage me, was the best part of the experience. But no one wanted to slog through another 3 hours of this game just for those great 15 minutes.  I'm glad I backed out because this game has never hit the table again since.

Humans travel/race across the post-apocalyptic world trying to reach a sanctuary.  While not cooperative it is in your best interest to help other players. If players die they turn into mutants which are actively trying to hurt other players.  Dice rolling combat, tile exploration, and time/resource management game.

Not a bad game but a bit of a dissapointment. The game feels like it's still a prototype. It needed more development and play testing. For example: Why is what amounts to a victory point tracker the centerpiece of the game when the actual play area tiles are off to the side? Why are we laying tiles in our own play area with no interaction with other players? Why aren't we building the whole game space as we play? Why is combat so clunky and why is it necessary to have SO MANY rolls per player? Why isn't the mutant stuff more interesting and better integrated into the game? I feel like we were promised a deep story-driven adventure game with lots of interaction and a cool mutant mechanism, and what we got was multi-player solitaire with clunky game play

There is a high level of randomness, but I enjoyed playing. The method in which you interact with other players is interesting, via the different terrain types. I wish there was a way to add a little more variety into play. I feel like, even though there are fairly large stacks of explorations, that given enough plays it will feel repetitive. Haven't reached that yet though!

Unique dystopian sci-fi adventure/survival game.  Wholesome ameritrash components and luck, though rules are in some areas unnecessarily complex (especially combat).

Overlong for what it is, too much rules overhead for what it is, repetitive (only 4 actions to choose from, and you are doing only 2 of them most of the time), lacking in interaction despite the supposedly interactive-type theme, and with wonky endgame conditions.

If you like the theme, you may get one interesting play out of it to experience the mutant narrative, and then you will likely not be eager to play again.  If that is worth 40+$ to you, go for it. If you are neutral on the theme? There are hundreds of games more worth your time.

Yet another "Let the Kickstarter pledger beware" story.

Really Really wanted to like this game, loved the theme but it doesn't come through in the game at all. Very Dull flip a tile move onto it starve, run out of bullets repeat.

Coming from a  group that love the whole survival/zombie/post apocalyptic theme everyone to a man was bored to death after 90 minutes.

Hats off to the guys for trying but this feels cheaply made and like a home version of a board game a few friends cooked up and managed to make work as a kickstarter by selling the theme so well, hell i bought into it hook line and sinker.

This game is a complete headache on many levels. Video reviews make it seem like much less of a mess than it actually is. There is no way to describe the actual experience until you play it. If you do, you had *better* read all the errata to compensate for the awful rulebook, and insert your own house rules to make up for the more broken aspects (most notably food/hunger).

Playable with ~3 players only.

Watched the ~ 1.5 hour vid from Radho (thx Radho) and got a pretty good feel for the game (this is also because I [i]was[/i] co-designing a very similar game from 2009 that was a cross between this and Dead of Winter)

The premise is very cool and of course I like it, you can definitely see the FFG influence here; things like theme, lots of cool options to upgrade equipment and character stats, neat semi-coop aspects included like trading, or camping together, working as a team as mutants, etc but I have a few specific concerns with this title ATM: 

Downtime - Looks to be an issue again as it was in DOW, only for different reasons here, and I'm not sure it is tweakable here like it is in DOW (the tiles with 2 encounters in one spot seems particularly troublesome)

Repetitive - Only 4 actions to choose from, and most of the time you're going to being picking the same two, over and over  

Luck - Definitely seems on the high side, could be in line for this type of game but also might be too high and pretty much determine the winner (hard to say for sure without a couple of plays, just how it looks, depends on length too and again at higher player counts I think it might be too high for the length)

The game looks like it will work fine solo or even better 2 players, but those are the weakest numbers by far it seems and the game will be missing more than it already is at those counts. Even with 3, I think it could be a little lacking but with 4 or 5 the game could definitely get interesting in the 2nd half if one, two or three players turn Mutant(less the downtime aspect). Its not the same kind of Intrigue that DOW has however (potential traitor and most of the time you are never sure) and the kind I really like, but at least it changes from being a pure semi-coop sort of straight forward race (semi because you can trade or even help each other a little) to now having to contend with "thinking" opponents who are actively plotting against you and trying to get a team win by having all the surviving Humans lose (forcing them to potentially cooperate more to just survive and try and win). Even at higher player counts this "players turning to Mutants" may not even happen, but it does seem like chances are it will (it also seems players will often have the option to do it too which is kind of cool like if you're losing too badly screw it go Mutant) 

Not sure I like the all or nothing damage system, it seems like it works okay but also seems to remove some tension too and make fights less meaningful since many times you avoid damage completely instead of it culminating (then all of a sudden you lose and can take big damage, so also hard to mitigate against and takes away some management aspect). 

I'm probably a bit biased here in this next bit but it seems without the hidden objectives or potential traitor element it seems to be missing just that little "something" and maybe a little too straight forward, which in those cases is a big dose of Intrigue and tension. Here someone eventually might turn Mutant and when/if it happens, its just open info, it will help a lot though when it happens to alleviate that feeling I think. 

Anyway those are just my initial thoughts. I'll eventually probably want a copy in trade to fool around with, but the game is WAY too expensive for a Canadian currently, with shipping and exchange its $90 before taxes possibly even get added and game has no minis so even if I really wanted it that would be enough to back me off and wait (coupled with the fact it seems like no experienced playtesters were sent the game for development purposes)

I really like post-apocalyptic themes so I really have high hopes for Posthuman.

For now I can say that the game wasn’t cheap so I expected better components´ quality, they are very flimsy :(.

I bought the KS edition, but my copy of the game came without the KS content :(. The publisher is replacing it though.

I expect to play the game soon.

As a solo game it would be a 5 or 6 with the rules as written. A small tweak on how the event deck is built raised this game up to a 7 for me. As a multiplayer game, it is long, but fun. There were some good decisions to be made, but it seemed like it could allow for a run-away leader with few mechanics to help compensate for it.

This game had huge potential but every time I play it I find it frustratingly flawed. I've tried several games with varying players and no one has ever made it to the fortress at the end. Only one time was a single player even close to it. I never seem to find many items throughout a play session; maybe one weapon or armor per player if you're lucky. I also think that the game missed an opportunity on more player interaction. I'm working on major revisions to make the game both more playable but with huge additions of player interaction while keeping the a high but manageable difficulty level of actually winning. There are also numerous minor flaws that I think could have been addressed with additional play-testing but this isn't an in depth review and I won't be discussing everything that I like and dislike about it.

RATING: 5
The game has strong balance and a good, if somewhat disorganized, rule set. It takes twice as long to play as it says on the box, which makes this strictly a 2-3 player game, in my opinion. Using the Defiant expansion to play 5 or 6 is ludicrous. Nothing here justifies a 3 hour play time!! There is NO thematic text in the rules whatsoever. Need to go to the website for that (and there you'll get full on short stories...?). And the decision tree is shallow. This is nothing more than draw a card and roll dice to see if you defeat it.

The new element the game introduces is that as you take wounds from mutants you gain scars that can later turn you into a mutant! THIS is an amazing idea with so much potential. However, when it happens, all you essentially do is harry the other players and try to prevent them from winning as well. Why a game would take such a fabulous idea and boil it down to a rendition of "Well if I can't win, then you can't either. Neener neener!" is utterly baffling. What a missed opportunity. Here's hoping someone can pick up that idea and do something interesting with it.

I think this is a much better game than it gets credit for. The two different combat mechanics don't help it at all, but after we'd played it a few times, it does really seem to make sense and to capture the theme of the game world.  We've house-ruled a few things, but not very much and every time I think about it I want to break it out and play a round.

First the positives. 
-Good production value- board, cards, meeples and chits are good quality.  
-Unique play on variable power (create your own).
-Some good decision-points that really make gaming enjoyable (how to spend kill-points.

Nonetheless, I will sell this game for $10 and feel bad for overcharging. 
- Turns are agonizingly slow.
-Very non-grandiose.  You don't feel like you've done much by the end of the game.  You look in front of you and you're like "I upgraded my strength from a 3 to a 5 and laid down 6 tiles.  That's it.
- 5 hits and game is over.  That's right.  Not 5 unsealed hits, or 5 health. Just "get hit 5 times?" You lose. Lame.
- Way way too complicated.  Most of the complexity doesn't feel like it adds anything very meaningful- like "both on same type of terrain".
- player interaction feels awkward and forced.
- mutant powers are mostly really lame.
- Too easy to go from lead to dead in one turn with a bad dice roll
- Just all around feeling of "when will this game end?" It's not enjoyable.

A dice chucking ameritrash game (which I'm usually fine with and more than not look forward to) that is longer than advertised. The game is not co-operative, until you're playing to tie for first, but what actually feels like last. The rules all make sense, the actions are simple, and the motions are almost too simple. The character design and role-playing level up with new skills, ability score increases, and equipment are all things I love, but the game just could have been better implemented with these aspects. The game has theme, but the encounters aren't that story-driven, rather just retelling of events, and all of the mutant related theme just kind of loses its intrigue. The game length can be cut arbitrarily and started at anywhere on the trail, although the rulebook suggests taking off 1/3 of the game. I think what makes me dislike this most is the changing into a mutant. I'd rather just be eliminated at that point, since actively playing spoiler against the other players wasn't fun and didn't make me feel like I was accomplishing anything. I guess that's the point, to be part of the hive mind and not think about the fun you're having or others' fun after you've changed.

RATING: 6
3 players. Here are the thoughts from one of the others players as I couldn't have put it better: "The equipment is cool. The skills are cool. The option to create your own character is cool. The events and encounters are cool. The mutant side is cool. But the lot put together is just really lackluster. I think its just over complicated. Even at 3 players the downtime between rounds if everyone is having a combat encounter is too long. I wouldn't want to try it past 3 players but it might only get better at higher player counts where people turning mutant is more likely. Overall the game looks really good and it sounds great but it's just too fiddly and doesn't live up to its impression."

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This carries the same problem all coop-etition games have - refusal to work together in most cases even if necessary since it is a race to the end. Once a character mutates, they take a different role and make the lives of the other players even more miserable. Flavor of the game is great, but success is challenging and making it to the end would involve a fair bit of luck and skill. The player board quality was disappointing - cardboard was thin for those boards and some tokens but thicker for others? Board is largely unnecessary - just a glorified scoring track. Tons of cards! Did not play with the expansion. Interested in trying again but be aware that game duration is fairly long - particularly learning games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really wanted to like this game. We played it yesterday, and were pretty disappointed. I'm hoping we missed a rule or two, and were playing wrong. The difficulty was off the charts impossible. Like, there's no way to survive. Maybe it was a bad first draw on the event, some bad rolls, and some unlucky encounters all in a row. 

As a side note, the estimated playing time is listed as 30 minutes per player, but it was closer to 1.5+ hours per player... which leads me to believe (and hope) we were doing something wrong. But if we were, we can't figure it out from the rulebook. We'll consult the FAQ and forums for some insight before our next playthrough.

Update:  I have played this several times now with other players.  I've enjoyed it very much.  Highly thematic, with character development.  Upgraded rating to 8.5

The game itself I would rate an 8 to an 8.5.   The rules, 2.  So I deducted a point off the final rating, just because the rules could be so much more clear.  
I've played a couple of solo plays and we just finished a 4 player game today and all the players said they would like to play it again.  Fun, heavily thematic game, but the rules could just need an overall, there should be a FAQ and errata posted ASAP.

RATING: 6
Posthuman on the surface seems like it should work - it's awesome looking and has a great theme - but ultimately it doesn't (for me).

It's a competitive multiplayer solitaire game where you play against the game instead of each other. It's a race to the finish and the game provides challenges to each player in a different way, so if I get 3 really tough encounters or my dice suck, I fall behind while my opponents may get a great lead because they had a much easier path.

As a catch up mechanism, players can turn into mutants and then attack or create obstacles for the human players. If every player becomes a mutant, then everybody wins. So, in a 3 player game, you could have 2 mutant players trying to turn the last human player into a mutant before he/she reaches the objective and wins the game. If they succeed and turn the last player into a mutant, they win. But how is that a win? It just feels like "oh, I couldn't win, so I'll stop you from winning too". Lot's of fun... :gulp: Besides, playing a mutant is pretty much just playing a card on your turn, not really fun.

The solo game is quick and okay but can't compete against other much better solo games.

En el juego, los jugadores son seres humanos en un viaje solitario a una casa que promete seguridad. 
Este viaje les lleva a través de diez zonas. A medida que viajan, se encuentran el uno al otro, otros humanos y mutantes. 

Los encuentros con los mutantes pueden causar cicatrices y mientras más cicatrices, menos humano se es..y más "posthuman" se vuelven. Van a tratar de aferrarse a su humanidad, y evitar ser un posthuman, mientras consiguen su objetivo: Llegar a la casa segura, y así ganar el juego.
También se puede ceder a la mutación, que es cada vez más tentadora, y unirse así a los post-humanos, negando la victoria del resto de los normales.

I have enjoyed one multiplayer game and half of a solo game of Posthuman. I don't think it's too fiddly or complicated. Player turns including, including combat, went smoothly. We had a reasonable number of rules questions as we progressed through -- not more or less than any other game of similar scope in my estimation. 

The part of the game that sounds fantastic but seems to break down quite a bit for us was the idea that everyone wins if you all turn into mutants. I think there should be an incentive for a single mutant player to win. Otherwise, once there is a single mutant player, the easier path to victory (for everyone) is likely cooperating to make all remaining players mutants for a shared win. That seemed to take the steam out of the end game for us. If we had mutants competing to become the leader mutant or something, I think the end game would have been far more competitive and compelling.

Excellent theme gives a good sense of desperation. Unbalanced character builds punish investment in ranged weapons. "Fight or Flight" (being able to attempt to run from an encounter) seems like the only significant choice once the game starts, as it's almost always apparent when Camping, Foraging or Moving is ideal. Rules of combat are not the most intuitive, and the wound system can lead to extremely quick KO's based on 2 bad rolls. Winning or losing never feels like your own decisions had anything to do with it, it all comes down to luck of the dice. Game drags with more than 1 person, especially if only the owner knows how to play. Fairly enjoyable as a solitaire game but would not recommend as a multiplayer game. Recommended way to play is solo, and be prepared to do 2-3 attempts. Game takes long enough to set up that only playing 1 (unless you get a lucky, long run) doesn't seem worth the setup/breakdown time.

My favorite post-apocalyptic game so far.  Story driven.  Cooperative game that can be stingy on the goods necessary to survive.  In this case the difficulty is a plus.  Additionally, if you succumb to the plague that has taken out most of humanity, you get to keep playing as a mutant with a goal of stopping the remaining survivors.  Great fun!

I find the game in the same vein as Power Grid. In all our games, players will move to the end of 'phase one' and fight guys constantly for the right set of gear, ammo/food, to ensure they can just run through phase 2 and 3 to win.  Its a stalling game with a burst ending.

All in all, felt it was a good game but not a great game.

Basically Fallout: The Board Game. The one glaring flaw to it, however, is how mutations work. Becoming a mutant is a little arbitrary and random, and it usually means that the game is going to end in defeat for everybody pretty quickly. That aside, this is an incredibly thematic experience. This is up there with Arkham Horror and Firefly as a very solid and engrossing experience game.

This game is really fun and enjoy able. The rules took a little bit to fully understand but I think I am playing the game right. Each player is in a race to get to the last human city which can only let one of you in. AS you progress you have to make choices like when to eat or when to fire your gun vs melee and other typical survivor game scenarios. Like most games that have a potential to turn players into the monster they are fighting the last few turns may or may not be fun if you are the last surviving human player as the mutant players team up against you.

A highly thematic post apocalyptic game that suffers from a lack of play testing and meaningful decisions, especially in combat - roll well you win, roll bad you lose. Evasion is not a real option yet it should be a central theme to a survival game. You are instead forced to fight encounter after encounter with no say in the matter. Complaints about the combat system being difficult were unfounded but game play in general is clunky with fiddly rules that are easy to forget. You will find yourself referencing the manual and [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132779/posthuman-official-errata-and-faq-v201]FAQ[/url] far too much even after multiple plays. The tile placement element is unique but under utilized and the penalty for scouting is so great you almost never do this unless you are in a safe zone. Thus, you will likely wind up with a randomly drawn map based on pure luck that can easily decide the winner. In the end, the game runs excessively long and feels more like it is playing itself.

Pros:
* Highly thematic.
* Looks great on the table.
* Switching to a mutant is unique and keeps players invested when winning seems out of reach.

Cons:
* This game easily over stays its welcome with a 1-2 hour per player minimum game time.
* Card text is tiny, hard to read and should have been condensed.
* There are far too many decks of cards to shuffle.
* Mutant abilities seem underdeveloped.
* Scouting is almost useless since you are more likely to starve.
* Shooting is under-powered.
* The game more often appears to be playing you.

This game is beautifully put together and the theme is strong and it isn't "Zombies" as much as Mutants.  Love the fact you can become a Mutant through this process and the dice elements are fun.  That being said the game is not very balanced.  It can go from very easy to incredibly difficult and quickly and randomly.  Level 3 cards can decimate you fast and it seems almost to much "Luck" to survive it to the end.  Love that it has a Solo version but don't expect to Win very often if not ever.

Kickstarter project co op survival game (from mutant humans). Seems like a cool game but price is high for the kickstarter ($61 including shipping). Look for it in stores for cheaper when it releases, around October 2015.

very cool game - nice components, great story telling potential.  Of course we had Mt B run the game for us, I'm not sure you'll get all of that from the rulebook / videos.  A little long for my group 2-2.5 being the length for a 4 player game.  Would definitely play again at a covention.

On one hand I really enjoyed the theme and narrative to the game, felt connected to my character and had no issues with any of the mechanics, including oft criticised combat.

On the other however it didn't seem to pose any dećisions and 90% of the time I just picked the move action, only sometimes forced to decide on tactical escape, and for a game that will most probably last over two hours, this is not really acceptable. Merchants and Marauders offer much more in that playing time, and the incessant sequence of virtually mindless, dice-focused combat made me think of of Gauntlet of Fools, a connection not giving it any credit, despite the fact that I am actually fond of the latter.

Surprised how much I like this game.  It plays really well 2 player, decent 3-player, and ok 4-player.  Complex and random enough for repeated plays, however length increases as the number of players increases. A good blend of Euro and Ameritrash elements, each play through seems unique.  Only gripe is leveled against the "turning mutant" and "playing as a mutant" mechanic.  Never feel any satisfaction trying to turn other players mutant as the game play in that regard is quite limited.  However, managing to make it to the "Fortress" while being chased by multiple mutant players is quite enjoyable.

Lots going on here.  You need a large set up area for game board & numerous decks of cards, tokens, dice, etc.; for players to expand own territory base; and to add skills and equipment to character.  Very fiddly, confusing at times, but eases with more play.  Rules are not always straightforward nor easy to find.  Cardboard tokens come unglued.  Holding cards warp causing strength tokens to slide under cut-outs.  Print on cards is very small making it difficult to read.  Wanted to like this game but it was painful to play. After hours spent reading the forum posts and watching the video reviews, I finally got a handle on this beast and played a relatively smooth SOLO run-through.  Starting to like this one.  [UPDATE: I am using yellow, white, green, red, and blue dice to represent the character strengths instead of the chits.]

An interesting idea and amazing attention to detail (example: there's a "flare" card you can fire to make trading between players easier).  Runs way too long, combat is crushingly difficult and the early part of the game is basically multiplayer solitaire.  There's a great Ameritrash game in here but it needs some more iteration.

RATING: 2.8
I will never be willing to face that rulebook again. Never. (Ignazy T, all is forgiven.) So, per the BGG rating rubric, I can't even give this jumble of good intentions a 3. I feel a bit bad about that; the premise is interesting and, hey, the dice spin rather pleasingly, but nope, nope, nope - never again. The promise of rumored fun left completely after a shocking amount of time had passed (my husband is too embarrassed to let me say how long, but check other comments - we're not alone) and one of us had yet to leave the starting tile. #thehorrorthehorror

RATING: 6
What posthuman lacks in quality of gameplay it tries to make up for in flavor and narrative. I love the very light RPG elements, the sense of a lonely journey at the end of the world, the character customization, the map tile search mechanics, and the complexity. Since you can build your character to overcome it I can overlook the clunky and somewhat confusing battle dice mechanics which add far too much randomness to encounters. I can overlook the extremely long play times since there is a quickstart variation. I can overlook, even enjoy, the difficulty because it matches the feel of the apocalypse. But I wish the mechanic for turning into the enemy was actually fun. I bought the game excited to play a mutant if I lost and discovered one of the potentially freshest, most exciting gamplay elements is a terrible failure. Instead of adding a new dimension to the game it turns it into a long spite session for the players who lost their human characters. They get a small action on their turn (if they're lucky) and must sit and watch the human players play out their complex and engaging (did I mention long) turns. 

I would suggest keeping all your character stuff and just add on mutations if you become a mutant. 

I recommend this for diehard survival/apocalypse fans (a lot like the last of us) but to everyone else: it may not be for you.

This is a very good semi-competitive survival game I ever played. You have to manage your health, moral, food and gun ammunitions. Explore the world to sustain those while competing against the game's critters.
And when you die, you become a Mutant with a brand new achievement: killing the other humans.

In addition, this game introduce RPG components with Stats, Skills, Equipments, and XP-evolving.

Very nice components made with good quality materials. Unfortunately the game is mediocre at best, with some rules being over complicated whilst others not being fleshed out enough, leaving too many ambiguities. The combat system is too complicated and over engineered in comparison to the rest of the game, which is very easy and repeatable. In overall, this is not a game that will land on my table very often. The gameplay is rather dull and there is only one goal in the game, making it a kind of a race against time (or other players when playing in a group). 

This game had all the makings to be something good, but turned out to be a bit of a missed concept, unfortunately.

RATING: 6
I ended up kickstarting this one even though I was on the fence.  Generally when I do that I end up being disappointed.  But I really liked the character creation and adventuring aspects.  Post-campaign, they made some component changes that I thought were universally bad, mostly related to the player boards.  So I went into it with low expectations.

[thing=171835][/thing] is a post-apocalyptic competitive adventure game where each player is trying to make it to the stronghold first.  So there is kind of a race aspect, but it's mostly just multiplayer solitaire adventuring.  There is a lot of character customization between variable stats, skills, and equipment.  To win, you need to defeat at least 10 encounters that increase in difficulty as the game progresses.  Encounters are usually a single enemy, either human or mutant, but sometimes they can be groups of enemies or non-combat encounters.  

Combat is resolved by first firing any ranged weapons, then proceeding to 3 rounds of melee combat.  The rules for melee combat are a little wonky, but I actually really like how they work.  They make it so that only one person takes damage each round, so if you are a good fighter you can often defeat enemies without taking any damage.  On the other side, if you're a bad fighter and/or if you encounter multiple enemies, you can easily die from full health in a single encounter.  One death sets you back a decent margin.  Two deaths and you become a mutant, with the sole objective of preventing all the other players from winning.

The game is listed as 2-3 hours long, so I feared playing a learning game at the max player count would take 4+ hours.  But I believe we finished in about 2.5 hours.  The nice thing about 4 players is that you can mostly go simultaneously.  In combat, one person rolls for the enemies.  So with 4 you can resolve 2 rounds of combat at the same time.  Also, I hear it's a solid solitaire game, if that's what you're into.

[b]Overall, I felt like I had very little control over how my game progressed.[/b]  The loot and skills can be awesome or useless.  You camp and loot locations when you get the opportunity, then you get back to fighting random encounters.  You better hope that you don't run across a tough monster.  Usually the non-combat encounters are easiest, so hope to find those.  [b]Yet, ultimately it was a somewhat enjoyable post-apocalyptic adventure experience.[/b]  It's not perfect, but I think it fills a niche that I was missing.

Nice enough game, except player boards the quality is good. Gameplay-wise .. I must admit the game didn't live up to my expectations.

* The rulebook - almost everything is in there. Somewhere. But often scattered. It's for a reason that so many people come asking questions on the forum.
Next to that, Gordon (designer) has admitted that the completed tile token when you haven't foraged yet or want to stay on the last Safe House zone is confusing and unclear.

* Also imo we have some redundant rules. Like: 
a) the size of your melee party while fighting multiple opponents - while there is only 1 follower that could possibly influence that. None other of the 10 available followers counts in melee. Either do away with that rule or make every follower count, I'd say. 
b) tile reward and foraging - why not make it one action instead of 2 seperate things? 
c) the "3 cards in hand" rule. Better just make the inventory 4 spaces bigger. Such things.

* Mutants "win" - I think very few people (perhaps it's an idea to make a poll?) would consider becoming mutant is a "win" thing. I bet most people would consider it as "everyone loses". These are not X-men mutants, these are grotesque toothless creatures with 3 arms, a tail and eyes popping out of their skull.

* Luck - just personal taste but I think (bad) luck plays a far too great role in this game. After choosing your character there's not a lot of tactical decisions to be made and the outcome will mostly be made or broken by events and dice rolls. Which - again, in my opinion - doesn't it make it more exciting.

* Lastly there are a few imo silly rules that don't make gameplay any more realistic. Like 
- a weapon trader - that only wants to buy max 1 weapon to exchange for food. And apparently rather goes traveling around for weeks to trade one (and only one) weapon with someone else than to trade another weapon with you for some food?!
- Or when you are KO'd you go all the way back to the starter tile - but you somehow stay on the same spot on the progression board?
- Or that in a Safe House, you are "fed" and you can regain all your health and morale if you camp there for a few days - but you don't "eat" so you stay hungry??? Just plain weird!

For the rest I think it's decent. The components are good (except for the wobbly character board). Fighting and shooting (once you have figured it out) are ok.

Personally I'd give the game a 6.8/10. A bit higher with some houseruling (Which shouldn't be necessary).

This really seems to hit the same note to me as Arkham Horror. Yes, it's fiddly. I like fiddly! It's got good flavor text, it's got an interesting concept. The print quality isn't perfect, die cuts a bit off, and I think I could make some good suggestions about tile border colors and a few nitpicky graphic design things. That said, it's solid and I hope to play it more.

There's a lot to like about the narrative told by Posthuman, and its messy sprawl ends up being its greatest strength. Not everything works, in particular the whole "turn into a mutant" thing, and the things that work occasionally lumber along, but the result is better than I expected.

Enjoyed this race/story game. 
The mechanics of the game (once you wrap your head around them) work and are decent.

My issues with the game are as follows:
1) Hate the 'mutate' mechanic. It gets rid of player elimination, but feels half assed and that is only there because of player elimination issues.
2) I wish the encounters (specifically the decision/text ones) were a bit better. They feel a little too random, the choices do not seem all that great, and I wish they were streamlined a bit better. 
3) The few times I have played the game, it seems like food is a little un balanced. Due to the randomness of the tiles there were many time multiple players were stuck without food. Seems a little too hard to get (especially with other event cards where you use food as currency) 
4) Wish there was a bit more player interaction. There is a little bit but 95% of the game is you doing your own thing.

Played solo. It was fun and I'll definitely play solo again - in fact there's a pressure in my brain to play again instead of making my way through the unplayed portions of my collection. But since the entire mutation portion of the game is not part of solo, it's fairly straight forward. I will say, though, it was extremely hard to keep track of all the things that were modifying the current moment. And the rule book not very good. This was a game that needed an extensive glossary section of the rule book

LOVE the theme.  Potential concerns are downtime between turns, overall game length, fiddliness, keeping the decks organized (may need to create foamcore trays, and recalling all the little rules (although many seem intuitive).

Kickstarted (Funded Apr 24,2105)- project due Oct 2015 per initial projection. They are targeting an Essen release (Oct 8-11, 2015).  So, hoping to get this very soon!

--------------------------------------------------
This game is dripping with Theme....the non-combat encounters leave you with interesting moral dilemmas...and you're never quite sure when they will show up.  Combat takes a moment to get used to, but really makes for interesting decisions in how to best equip your character.  The decks have a metric ton of variabilty to the epic stories you'll weave on you adventure.  This game definitely has an RPG-lite feel.  There are interesting in-game social interactions....opponents may need to help one another, because if you get too much of a lead, your fellow racer may decide to "Go Mutant" and try to take you down and win that way instead.  Love how the terrain changes the likelihood of what you'll find.     

Plays well solo (very challenging)...The 2p experience isn't quite as strong as w/ 3+.  Not sure I'd want to play @ 5-6p due to downtime...although the higher player count would make the Race/"Go Mutant" battle very interesting (perhaps we'll try at an upcoming convention) 

Slightly disappointed in the thickness of the plastic-coated player-mats and counters, but overall the experience exceeded my high expectations.

Sci-fi apocolyptic human race for survival from our own genetically altered supplanters. Variable and customizable character powers, explore and scavenge random tiles, flee or fight dice-based combat system, and player mutation threat from scars. Seems like it can take awhile between turns. Not much interaction until human players become mutants and turn against the survivors--this is where the game gets interesting. The thematic human objective seems off. Wouldn't the safe house accept all surviving humans and not just the first? Evenso, the world is engaging and the encounters can be exciting with storytelling and an RPG feel.

Near-death doldrums with a mutant chaser.

Reasons why my rating will probably go down after a second play:

- A lousy rulebook, thanks to Kickstarter, that has generated hundreds of rules questions.  Despite my unflagging faith in humanity, it seems clear that designers and backers will never learn.

- Starvation death spirals if you start with a low-food character - or sometimes just any character - and get unlucky with card and tile draws.

- A reliance on trading to balance out the randomness of food/ammo/item rewards for foraging and encounters.  The problem:  Food is a critical commodity, and my opponents would rather watch me die (and knock me out of the game) rather than feed me.  No matter how beneficial the trade might be for them.

- Only tolerable with 1-2 players.  Far too long with any other player count.

We took a chance on the kickstarter and the game did not deliver for us. It feels amateurish and lacking elegance of design. Abstractions introduced by the game mechanisms take away from the immersion into the theme. The combat for example is unnecessarily convoluted and has been handled in far better ways by scores of other games. The exploration lacks tension and just feels like card flipping and dice rolling. This game is a dud.

We have played 3 times so far (4 players) and I don´t think this game is hitting the table again anytime soon. 2 times we broke off early, since we had 2 players turned and didn´t see any chances of pushing through and one time one player was so powered up, that we had no chance to catch up to him. I think there are a couple major flaws: 
1.) there are only very few choices (move/forage/camp) that the game feels very repetative despite all the rules, cards and tokens. 
2.) You play next to each other more than anything else.
3.) Turning mutant is just not fun since you don´t really win (at least it didn´t feel like winning).
4.) It is way to long for a game which depends so much on luck.

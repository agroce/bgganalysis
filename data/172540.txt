Very enjoyable abstract game with incredible production values (I played the metal version). It has very much luck based (card draws, dice to resolve combat, dice to place scoring opportunities), but still plays very well for all that.

Played through it a couple times. Lots of fun. Simple mechanics but still high depth of enjoyment. Admittedly with fewer players, luck might play a heavier role. However it is a great game. The card mechanic is a great way to keep the game varied, forcing players to play tactfully instead of simply destroying everything they can find.

I cannot rave highly enough about the beautiful art and super premium materials that come with the game. If you're a fan of dragons at all, the game is worth it purely for the great metal pieces!

I look forward to the expansion coming out Spring 2017. I hope they keep the metal piece theme going strong. The guys at Lay Waste Games are very supportive as well. I met them at Gen Con 2016 and they did everything they could (and then some) to make sure my order went smoothly to keep my inner dragon happy.

I enjoy playing this game but I can't keep but feeling that my $70 could have been better spent elsewhere.

Pretty decent middle weight 45 min filler; great components.

This game is great. There's something about being a dragon and destroying villages & demanding tribute that appeals to the monster in me. The cloth board and bag as a scoring mechanism make it such a great travel game, too. I can not wait til November 2017 for my copy to arrive...

There is a lot to be said about this game.  

1. Wonderful immersive theme!  
2. One of the most beautiful games in my collection!  Maybe THE most!  Every ew gamer that sees me set this up is blown away and falls in love with the aesthetic instantly!  Not only are the components amazing- the design work on the board, box, bag, and rulebook are perfection!  I am a professional illustrator- and these guys knocked the art out of the park!
3.  Definitely falls into the entry-level/gateway game category-  perfect game to pull out for new gamers-  but even my uber boardgame geek friends and I have fallen in love with it as staple in our collection.  Yes, there is a lot of luck, but it is balanced nicely, and amazingly fun!  
4.FUN!!!!  in the age of incredible complex games, that result in so much coffee and silence that i wonder if I even had a social experience with my friends at all- this game is a breath of fresh air!
5. plays well with a huge range of ages.  Taught my 8 and 11 year olds, no problem.

CONS:

1. Everyone that has played it, wants it....BUT THERE ARE NO MORE!  Lay waste! Lets get moving!  (FYI, give me another shot at the gold dragon set please...super regretting I didn't up my kickstarter pledge)

Final thoughts/TLDR:  

Need something fresh and fun that you can bust out for players of any level of experience or almost any age!

Amazingly stylish game. Looks like something visually designed in the 70s, but with modern day mechanics.

I backed this game on Kickstarter. 
The game itself is FANTASTIC. The components are all great quality, which is astonishing given the variety (cardboard tiles, metal totems/player tokens/dice, cards, fabric game board). The game is very easy to play and learn with well-written rules as well.

The artwork and the theme are all very well execuded too. It feels like a game characters would play in an iconic fantasy setting from books or films. I could picture some drunken rangers drinking mead while playing at the Prancing Pony. Best of all, of course, the game is a lot of fun. 

Players play as dragons competing to be the first to earn 50 gold. To do so you have to take caim over villages, steal, and do battle. Each turn you get 3 actions. Each player gets a list of the actions they can choose from as well as a hand of cards that can be played for special abilities. Those two main gameplay components give players a lot of freedom to strategize and play how they want or react to other player actions.

This made the game very balanced. Just when you think there's no chance you could win, performing the right combination of actions/cards could change the tide of battle. 

I can't recommend this game enough. I backed about 20 games on Kickstarter in 2015 and this one is definitely my favotire. I can't wait to see what else the folks at Lay Waste Games come up with next and if it's on Kickstarter I'll definitely be there to support them.

I played at GenCon. The game first seemed very basic and I was like MEH. But after playing a few rounds, the strategy shined through. Maximize actions. Use some nasty card combos. Fun, strategic. It was a no brainer for me to buy it. I've played it maybe 8 times since GenCon. Still love it. Massive replayability (sp?)

Metal Dragons version
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Dragoon has some of the highest-quality components I've seen in a game. The canvas bags, the metal dice and the stunning cast dragons are gorgeous and deliciously tactile. The game and pieces look great and the art style is fanciful and unique. It's a simple, light game that suffers from too much randomness. Since the majority of the game is a product of several dice rolls each turn, the best laid plans of dragons and men often go awry at a single bad roll. It's especially awful when you roll a 1 for a village and it riots, stripping you of its resources. In spite of its flaws, the game has its rewarding moments - it feels great to rampage through the countryside (and other dragons) roaring and spewing flame.

Why this is not a 10:
-> Too many feel-bad moments from die rolls.

Strictly on the game play side Dragoon is fun. It's a light game with with a lot of player interaction. A large amount of the game is random, but the light nature and short playtime is fun.  While I'd pick it up if it were in the $30 range, the price is unfortunately much, much higher. The components are beautiful, but for such a light game it's more of a show piece than I game I'd get out constantly with my current group.

A game where you can be worshipped as a dragon or destroy like a dragon. Great concept and beautiful board design and artwork. The only downside to the game is the random placement of tiles can create a one-sided board that is hard for other players to interact with depending on where your dragons roost is located.

Dragoon isn't the most complex game you'll ever play.  I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be. This game is just fun to pull out of the box.  It's fun to set up.  And it is FUN to be a DRAGON!!! What other game can you say that about?

I first played dragoon at gen con 2015 and it was the highlight of the show for me.  I preordered it as soon as I got the chance and was extremely happy with the final product when it came. It is a ton of fun to play and is one of my favorite games. My one criticism would be that luck can play a fairly large factor especially when playing with 2-3 players, but other than that it is a very good game

This game plays as well as it looks. Gorgeous art, amazing strategy, and solid replayability. On the surface, it might appear basic, but for an avid gamer like myself, it felt great after many plays. Plus the whole game fits into the scorekeeper so it MAY just live in my backpack ;)

The pieces! I was immediately sold on the game from the pieces alone, I asked to see one of the dragon pieces and once I felt the heft of the metal I was already pulling out my CC. The game is a fun light territory control with an outside random mechanic that can hurt or help you on a dice roll. Take control of cities/towns while trying to butt out your opponents from their own cities. Play cards that lend you abilities and collect 50 gold before your opponents. Plays in about 30-45 min, takes only 10-15 to teach. Good game, great pieces, game can also be converted to be carried in a provided drawbag if you don't want to bring the beautiful box around.

One of my favorite games of all time, and I love teaching it to customers at the cafe! It captures the distilled spirit of the theme without being bogged down with unnecessary or cluttering mechanics. Anyone can play but there is real strategy involved. Absolutely wonderful.

Was fortunate to come across Dragoon at Gen Con this summer, and jumped at a chance to grab demo tickets.  I found this to be a really unique and enjoyable game.  So much so that I put in an online order that same day, springing for the colorful "Mantis" edition (I was too late to be a Kickstarter backer, sadly).  Based on a single 4-player session that took less than an hour, I would rate this game a 9/10.  Very creative concept, the design is gorgeous, there's a lot of room for strategy, the perfect balance of decision-making vs. randomness, and as I said, it plays fairly quickly.  Can't wait to see a Dragoon expansion at some point!

Played this once at Gen Con. I was surprised to enjoy it a fair amount, since it looked like it was going to be the sort of game that emphasized theme at the expense of mechanics. While it was a pretty thematic game, it held up mechanically. It was not bad. Not as much my thing, though, but still a decent game.

Simply the most beautiful game in my collection. Simple to teach and play; offers a balance of strategy and luck that works pretty well most of the time. I've had a few frustrating rounds, though. But thanks to being a rather lightweight game (ironically, considering all the solid metal pieces), it's fun most of the time.

Saw the game at Pax East, and really got to sit down to play at a Knight’s Move Café in Boston. I intended to play for an hour, and 5 hours later I was still playing. That night I supported the Kickstarter.

The game is very simple pick up, but had enough depth to make it challenging. The cards bring a lot of strategy to the game. A vaguely skilled player can easily turn the tide of battle in their favor, or just screw over the person in first. All the different strategies you can use are what makes the game fun (capturing or destroying towns, attacking the thief, forming temporary alliances with other players). 

Another thing is the quality of the game. I played the prototype of the game and the pieces already looked great. Cannot wait to see the finished product, since it should look amazing. Love the design theme, it looks modern and different from any fantasy game I have seen.

Would highly recommend this game to anyone.

After one initial play, this seems to be a really cool 4 player game. A bit too long for a filler, but with the right group quite entertaining. Might be a little swingy and luck driven for some.

Great game and seems to be pretty well balanced.  Very easy to pick up and teach and the concept is spot on.  It does seem that sometimes the villages can cluster on a couple sides of the board and not randomized around the board, which can make it difficult for some players to get an edge.  But otherwise plays very well and quality pieces.  (Although the paint is starting to chip off some of the dice.)

Played once at PAXEast and overall not a bad game but would have to play more times to get a true feel for the game.  The randomness of the cards can lead to some unbalanced play based on the luck of the draw; more plays needed to see how this works out.  I had a handful of cards that protected my cave but seemed the risks for raiding another dragons cave are not worthwhile enough for the movement effort.  Setting out villages uses the same dice mechanic as Flashpoint setting out smoke/fire which is good for replayability.

A pretty basic little strategy game where you either raze villages for immediate gain, conquer villages for possible future gain or combat other dragons, spiced up with some card play. Nothing special but works well enough and the metal components are pretty cool.

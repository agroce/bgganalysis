Update: que jogo interessante! Com uma mecanica simples comandada por 3 cartas (que são comandos simultaneos), o jogo funciona muito bem em 3-4 jogadores. Em 2 ele não me agradou muito porque o posicionamento inicial influencia demais na partida. Ótima surpresa com este aqui.

It's not actually a bad game, it's just a hollow game and the extreme, bland, abstract nature of it doesn't get my particular tastes.

RATING: 5
Initial impression after one play is that this is a nice little abstract strategy game where the theme is almost entirely chrome. It's not really a "4X" game, it's a game of moving your pieces around a board and trying to score more points than your opponent. Worth pulling out to play at lunch or for a light games evening.

4x games often suffer from 2 faults.  They run very long and for much of the game , 
Players can turtle - giving the vi tory to last player to emerge from a shell.  But neither of these traits show up in this surprisingly strong little game.  Using a clever and simple 3 commands, players must time their actions rather than plot when or if they should be done.  The key element of the game is the smart scoring mechanism.  In a straight up solution, the commands and scoring combine to produce a game that moves along and yet captures the feeling of a 4x game.  Overall, its a solid game and holds true to its feeling of 4x in a short time. I think the game could really shine as a 3-player experience. It's fast and easy enough to bring to a game event and so will likely make it into the game bag rotation.

RATING: 6
A neat wargame. Vicious too, as many of the games I've played have revolved around fighting for the key central system, or encroaching on the sectors of the player who controls it. Must make some decent counters for it.
Update: Earlier rating probably a bit generous, given the limited variation from game to game. Most turns, most players get identical scores, unless you're the player controlling the centre.

Played it once as a 2p game. I feel like 2p and 4p modes are only variants to a game that was thought-out as a 3p game.

I like that it was made for three players only, usually a hard spot to fill so more games here is a good thing. I also like the role selection a la Race for the Galaxy, the more people that choose a certain role the worse it gets. The actual gameplay was ok, but nothing really exciting. The old rule applies here that if two people fight over something the only winner is player number three.

Short programming game with deterministic combat. Timing and guessing on programming the three common orders is crucial.

Victory is dependent on maximizing the benefit of occupying the center of the board.

Ok, for 30 minutes, it's very bland. The only asymmetry is the layout of the planets and your starting location.

I am unfairly biased against the game because of its association with Kickstarter as well as the fact that it is trying to whittle down a 4X game, for which I have no real desire to see happen, as I would never choose to play a regular 4X game, so paring it down won't change things.

The micro nature of the game is annoying, since it basically results in an abstract game of chicken. The deterministic combat is boring because it is so predictable, draining the game of any personality or excitement. It really is little more than a souped up abstract.

The action programming with you getting stronger actions if you choose to play an action during different phases compared to your opponents sounds amazing mechanically on paper. In practice though, the few choices and the fact that choosing a less than predictable order often hinders what you want to do means the mechanic actually ends up being fairly bland in execution. Also, at least one action generally seems to be fairly weak at any given time (e.g. having no planets to explore, or having all options for combat being basically suicidal).

Without its action cards, the rest of the game is a fairly derivative area control where people push back and forth for control of spots and you try to fly under the radar while nabbing these spots. Sure there does require some finesse in leaching off sectors your opponent has most of their ships concentrated so that you score when they do, but the combat is boringly deterministic, each sector doesn't feel particularly unique, and the game overstays its welcome as a light filler. Just play Eight Minute Empires instead.

After seeing its nomination for Golden Geek and some comments, I PnP'd a copy of this - very easy to make. Initially missed that it was really a 3 player game (it is listed as for 2 on page) while I got it to be a light 2 player space/4X game. So these comments are for the game as a 2-player not 3-player. Our original play was wrong really the 3 player game with a player just absent and it didn't work. Plus the lines between hexes were much too hard to see. Played again with 2-player rules (3x2 universe, neutrals in the II and III systems, 10 turns). Redid the lines between hexes with silver pen too so nice and clear. 
We both knocked off some neutrals but J got in position to defeat the III neutrals first then held that for the rest of the game. I made some progress leeching points by getting into her sectors but then she began to neutralize me completely, attacking to destroy rather than defeat. My attempts to build up to take the III system were also thwarted as she could see even a first turn Exterminate coming and respond. My longer term plan was to stay in touch point-wise and score a lot at the end from occupying multiple sectors, J was pretty much restricted to 2 plus the III, in a fairly defensive formation. But even that was undone as J could spread out on that last turn after my last turn exterminate, without fear of reprisal. In short, I leeched a few points but the game was a foregone conclusion from the moment someone took the III spot. Disappointing.

Backed this on Kickstarter and I wasn’t disappointed. Indeed captures the essence of huge 4X games in a minimalistic design that lasts 30 minutes. Its biggest strength, however, is also its biggest weakness, as the options you have each round sometimes end up too few and you are in trouble whatever you do. Plus points for the multiple variants. A good filler overall.

This may be the small 4X-ish game I've been looking for. Each player can expand, explore or exterminate. The interesting part is each turn you secretly determine which of these you will do in order. The orders are revealed one at a time and executed. The more players that select an action at time, the less ships/moves you will get to do (example: you can expand more if you are the only one that chose expand for their first action). So with that it becomes a little of a bluffing game. The only thing I would like to see in an expansion is maybe individual player powers and/or some more tiles for variety (but the tiles are double-sided so you have some from the start).

Another minigame or "pocket game" that is supposed to be a filler but the playing time is much more than the box suggests. I'm not sure if this even properly playtested with four players, 8 round game is just ridiculously long.
 
It is very possible that you are effectively eliminated from the game due to bad luck with building ships and others attacking you. On the other hand, getting lucky with building allows you to dominate the board.

I like this game!  'Reading' other players as you simultaneously select your actions for the round is my favourite element of Pocket Imperium.  If you choose the same actions as others you only get to carry out a small potential of your actions (e.g. place one ship); if you choose your actions uniquely you get a bigger benefit (e.g. place 3 ships).  This is the strength of Pocket Imperium: simple rules that hide deeper gameplay.  I find myself staring at the board in-between turns, trying to work out where I need more ships, where I should colonise and, most excitingly, who to strike alliances with and who to attack!

Very much depends upon players consorting to keep the leader in check. Players behind in points can conspire to help one another by scoring tiles for each other and maximising points. Of course, if players choose to charge off on an aggressive course then they're just shooting themselves in the foot and it'll devolve into a mindless bashing fest. This is not a mindless bashing fest. Ships are hard to rebuild and need to be treasured.

A lot of game in a little box.  I really need to explore the game play of this a little more.  Games so far have tended to have players stick to their general area without a lot of exploration.  Random tile selection is interesting.  Would like to try the various configurations of the set up to see how they play.  

The shine has worn off a little as it is getting a little samey.  Scores tend to be very even given the generally symmetric play.

„Pocket imperium”, czyli kosmos w małym pudełku.

Plusy:
1.	Małe pudełko.
2.	Proste zasady.
3.	Grafiki na kaflach.
4.	Sporo możliwości modyfikowania planszy (rozkład kafli).
5.	Czas rozgrywki.
6.	Dobry tytuł, aby na przykładzie pokazać, na czym polega 4x.

Minusy:
1.	Słabo wyczuwalny klimat (subiektywne wrażenie).
2.	Skalowanie.

„Poczet imperium” to mała, szybka gra 4x. Osobiście czekałem w napięciu na pierwszą rozgrywkę i… się rozczarowałem. Nie ma tu klimatu, który się czuje w innych grach 4x s-f (może pocket też odnosi się do klimatu). Rozgrywka jest… no właśnie, jest dla mnie nijaka, nie ma tu emocji. Tytuł ratuje dodatek „Prosperity”, który składa się z 12 kart, ale potrafią dodać trochę emocji do tej gry. „Prosperity” to obowiązkowa pozycja, jeśli ktoś chce czerpać z „Pocket imperium” przyjemność. Gra nadaje się jako „czekadełko” w oczekiwaniu na resztę ekipy i większy tytuł. Grę oceniam na 5/10 (z dodatkiem „Prosperity” 6/10).

The decisions felt very random.
It takes very long for such a shallow concept.
The art is just 'ok'.

After seeing this game on the PnP GeekList, I tried the PnP version.  After three plays I can confidently say that this is NOT really the 4X game that is advertised in the rules.  

I would say that it barely meets the definition of 4X.  "Explore" is just movement with no fog-of-war or discovery.  "Exterminate" is just a 1-1 exchange.  I guess for a micro game, the experience had to be distilled down quite a bit, but that distillation process also filters out flavor.

Some may like this type of game, but it's just a little to generic for me.

With 2 players it feels too open and seems to go towards a draw too easily. Feels like it will be better with 3 or 4. Without any random elements aside from other players action it strongly feels like checkers in space. My box includes both the mech worlds and the prosperity expansions.

Light, inoffensive, takes a little long to play, and it's the pretty standard take over the world before scoring phases area majority with some space bits and a neat selection-order-of-three-actions with penalties for following the herd (or your neighbors). A little reminiscence of a longer space eight minute empire.

Only one play; the simultaeous action selection mechanism seemed to work well for this mini 4x game. In hindsight, the three player game offered opportunities for alliances and negotiation to develop in order to mitigate a runaway leader.

After demoing this game several times I have come to the conclusion that it's really easy to explain, it has lots and lots of clever bits and also plays very nicely.

Love sci-fi games and thought it was a cool idea. In practice I decided I wanted more than the micro game could offer and lost my desire to play. Sold so someone else could appreciate it. 

Included Mech Worlds and Prosperity expansions

Micro space 4x as the title advertises. Basic play of programmed actions to expand, explore and exterminate. Modular random planetary tiles in a small system around a central main planet makes for early and constant interactive confrontation. Outguess the action order of your opponents and get extra moves for being the contrarian. Area control of the system planets determines exploitation scoring. Reminds me of checkers in space.

Really enjoy this.  Genuinely gives the feel of an epic game in a small space.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  There have been a few good reviews and a few negative ones, so i wasn't sure what to expect.
I've realized, since playing the game, that the negative reviews stem mostly from the expectation derived from the name and premises of the game rather than the actual gameplay.
Going in, everyone should know this ISN'T A 4X GAME!  Mechanically, this game does distill each of the 4X elements into simple concepts.  But, similar to how you could say that chess distills a characters political importance, strategic flexibility and brute strength into positions and movements, Pocket Imperium can still not capture the fifth, unnamed thematic portion of a 4X game that defines the genre, the same way chess doesn't capture the thematic feel of war the same way a true war game does.
That said, for such a small simple game, there is a good amount of depth and strategy.  The planning phase is interesting because it relies on bluffing as well as strategy.  And, once everyone's plans have been relieved, the action phase does reward tactical flexibility.  Since the actions you can take depend on whether your opponents wish to take the same action, you need to be able to adapt your strategy as it unfolds.
There are some rules that I did miss the first couple of times playing the game.  these were mainly restrictions (and broader options) placed on the Exterminate action.  The Expand and Explore actions are simple and require little explanation.  But the Exterminate card seemed under powered till i realized you could use ships from multiple hexes to invade a single hex, as well as the fact that you can invade an empty planet (called "systems") rather than just ones containing your opponent.
My only other small gripe was the terms that the instructions use for the different spaces of the board.  Each modular board piece consists of 7 hexes - some containing planets, some empty.  The rules call each module a "sector" and each planet a "system" (empty hexes are just called "empty space").  Now, [sector and system] are obviously different words, but I often read a rule and swapped the two, making if a bit harder to learn the game.  I would have preferred if they had just called the planets "planets"!  They are depicted as such, and the word is much more clearly delineated from the "sector" name for each module.  Its a small gripe, but one that I made a clear decision to fix myself when teaching the game (people kept asking me "which one's a sector and which one is a system again?" till i just started calling the systems planets).
The other criticism i've hear in other negative reviews is the deterministic battles.  There are no dice, no surprises.  Battles are as simple as "kill one ship by sacrificing one ship.  That's it.  I, personally, love this though.  To me, there is nothing worse than waiting for two people to finish a battle that you aren't part of.  When dice or convoluted tactical options are part of those battles, I often want to just quit.  Not because I don't enjoy them, but because explaining them to new players, or waiting for AP prone player to decide on them is PAINFULLY NOT FUN!
So, the fact that this game has such a simple battle mechanic makes this an easy one to teach aswell as a vastly more tolerable one to watch.
All and all, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a quick game with a little bite.  It wont go down in the annals of boardgame greatness.  But it scratches a little itch for an abstract game while giving just enough of a theme to not come off as dry.
Like you could say that chess is a game about a war game rather than a war game itself, Pocket Imperium is a game about a 4X game rather than an actual 4X game.

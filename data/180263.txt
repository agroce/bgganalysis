This is obviously a labour of love.  It's Choose Your Own Adventure: The Board Game.  Unlike Robinson Crusoe, this doesn't pretend to be a game where your decisions matter.  You're thrown into the world and left to explore; that's the game and it works really well.  

It's innovative and enjoyable.  I need more play thoughs to see if the scenarios maintain my interest after the original wow factor wears off.  I feel like my opinion of this may go down with more plays.  I certainly am not interested in replaying areas/scenarios after dying like in TIME Stories.

Also, is this format better suited for an app?  Fairly fiddly.

UPDATE : Read a review that this actually becomes more of a game after you explore and efficiency becomes important to win.  Also, if you lose you reset everything, so this is probably more like a 7 for me.  Enjoyed playing it, would play again, but several reservations about the game for me (length, repeating missions, efficiency in a game with lots of randomness).

2017 11 01 : provisional rating. I have really enjoyed my first expeditions... it’s truly an amazing achievement in game design. However, having almost fully explored the island and failed a few times I am now reticent to start again and try to beat the first scenario. It feels overwhelming somehow, knowing the length of the game ahead. Part of it is that I really have no clue how to solve it.

For now, I think I will wait for the expansion for the errata cards and try again then.

One comment; I came to dislike the design choice to make EVERYTHING a numbered card. I think the play experience would have been improved if certain types of cards had been simply decks of cards that were shuffled and placed to the side of the game board. Things like conditions, food, etc. It’s hard to randomize properly in the existing format! And it would make getting to the actual story elements easier. I think I might make this change going forward.

Finally could play it again after receiving my copy, and I must say the game is a blast! A chose your own adventure game with some interesting gameplay (resource management, crafting, push your luck, etc). 

The crafting system is sometimes quite un-thematic, but improves gameplay, so we'll see how that pans out. 

The multiplayer elements do look a bit more promising, but I'll need more plays to check if it really is an interesting proposition to play multiplayer, besides the very real satisfaction of sharing a good time with good company!

A much overrated game due to its scarcity because only available via Kickstarter. The rulebook is a mess, not clearly stating how to achieve the goals for getting the much needed "stars". 

Some of the "adventures" one faces come down to: "solve it and continue the game or fail and be stuck here forever".

Replayablility is very low since if you know the way to the goal there isn't much need to go away from the straight path to "explore" beyond that.

Even the "Choose your own path" - adventure books had more variability.

The rating "4" comes from the nice artwork and the overall - design of the game, not from playability. I would rate this a 3 max.

This is a paragon of old school adventure games. Not quite as passive as some Lucas Arts games, but also not as combaty as others.  It is a solo game that basically requires a well adjusted hive mind to play with multiple people. As a solo game it seems like something sent from heaven, as a co-op, I think there are more specialized experiences that can deliver what that co-op group wants. Do they want a dungeon crawl? do they want to save the world from viruses? do they want to escape from a temple? do they want to time travel and visit an insane asylum? It is a game that if made 10 years ago would have simply dominated and defined solo/co-op. As it is now, alpha gamers need not ask other players to join.  Solo players looking for some wonderful 90's adventure game action need to look no further.

This is the boardgame version of a classic point & click adventure. A little fiddly with the cards. Replayability is quite low, but it will take you many many hours to solve all the curses.

Backed on Kickstarter September 2015
Played the PnP demo on 23 October 2015 - Died on the island as I attempted to launch a raft off the east side.
Second attempt, Roped a couple of sea turtles and escaped off the west side very quickly but with less exploring.
Looking forward to the game but anticipating that I will die a lot as I like to explore everything I can.

August 2017 - Exceeds my expectations. Fantastic gameplay and an amazing world to get lost in.

There is so much going on here. The system is super smooth and runs like a well oiled machine. The world feels alive and dynamic. The save system is very clever and provides good 'resets' for hunting areas meaning that the game is always subtly changing around you. Learning about the different flora, fauna and areas that the game takes you is great fun and opens up possibilities as the game progresses.

It actually feels more like a computer game and is the best solo experience I have ever had with a game.

Currently sharing top spot with Gloomhaven for 2017's game of the year. Definitely fiddly with all the card searching and shuffling but wow, what an experience. Story-driven gaming at its best and definitely the absolute best exploration game I've played. Awe-inspiring for the content alone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Cool adventure card-laying game. Lots of cards, quite a bit of reshuffling going on(at least for one deck of the game). Full of choices, a good 2p game for the a couple if you like the adventure discovery/card driven/mystery games. There are slightly too many rule/subrules so don't expect to get everything right from the first session, but you should get there by the end of the first or scone session. Comes with a few curses(mystery scenarios) that can be played again (there is a few random encounters that might change the flavor but honestly the map remains the same so..take a small basket where replayability is concerned). All in all a fun experience that needs quite a bit of time (i am estimating a good 3-4 sessions of a couple of hours each for the first scenario that i believe being half way through) but is quite interesting, unique and satisfying. Quite hooked for now.

Excellent addition to the boardgame family. The graphics are perfect. Many of its mechanics should have been introduced to boardgames long ago. It is also free of any unnecessary fiddliness. However, it is not a 10 because I found that the hand management mechanic does not account for the amount of strategic decisions I would prefer. I'd like it a tad more heavy.

The designers have put a lot of work into this. A huge game world, great artwork and with a cool sense of real exlporation here where you really discover the continent.

BUT: The game lacks exciting moments. It is more like a feel-good experience. There aren´t any emotional bumps in this game.

Despite the immense effort of the designers, this game is just good. But in my opinion it is overhyped for what it is.

And because of that I am slightly disappointed.

RATING: 10
(Spoiler-free review) 
Based on one session (so far), this game is a hit.  I played with two friends visiting from out of state, and after four hours of playing they decided that they would definitely be backing the second KS campaign, and wished it was available (for a reasonable price) sooner.

Here are my complaints, and I consider them minor:
1) I wish there was a feasible way to store the game state for more than one campaign at a time.  Yes, this is *technically* possible by recording the status of each card (by the unique card identifiers), but this seems too painful to do regularly.  I think that this is just a fact of life, though, not a "problem" with the game.
2) I'm concerned about replayability.  Caveats: I haven't completed my first campaign, let alone started a second, so it may be that there ends up being little overlap between the campaigns,  Also, even a single campaign is up in the 20-hour range, which is the equivalent of one or two dozen "normal" games -- so there is quite a lot a play value there, even before considering replay.

Great game, so far!

Update: I've played four attempts now, and have yet to survive.  To be fair, two of those were single-session "tutorial" attempts, and one attempt I stupidly forgot that the game isn't quite over yet when you exhaust the action deck -- I was in trouble, but not dead yet.  The fourth I died like a (cursed) man, by drawing the curse card from the discard pile after several a series of desperate turns of trying to recover my action deck.  Still lovin' it, and looking forward to trying again this weekend!

An interesting aside regarding my #2 "complaint".  All four of my attempts have been with the initial curse, so I've played on through some of the same map sections up to four times.  I've found that there are alternate pathways to proceed each time -- whether that path is chosen deliberately or "chosen" for you by accident.  But even when playing the same portion of the map, although the "surprise" factor is reduced, there is still tension -- you are trying to find *better* paths, so that you can make it a little further before dying this time.  So the replayability may be better than I feared.

Love the theme and that you can choose your own path in this game! 

The game is a bit complex. More complicated and fiddly than games I would normally pick up. I find myself checking the rule-book a bit too often but I think after I get a few more plays under my belt it will be much easier.

It's a difficult and punishing game and I have failed on my first 2 attempts at the 1st curse thus far - but I'm determined to get through it as with each card flip the variable reward possibilities are so addicting.

This is game is really a masterpiece!

it is one of the best games in my collection as of now and id say is the best Survival board game I have ever played, the fact that i my never know everything that this game has in it, is fantastic. ill be playing this game for years to come.

the only reason why is not a 10 is because, is a game that you will wont to play with the some people and you have to play it in Sessions, so when you wont to play it, you will have to wait for them or they just are going to have to wait for you, which mean you will have to plane your time with them so you and them are able to play long hours. when you wont to play a new game with others, you cant coz you will have to end your ongoing game. time it well and play it with people you know will be able to play Regularly. 

but is still a blast to play.

ps, you will get lost in the world a couple of times. xD

I'm giving it a "soft" 9.  I had a wonderful time playing it and enjoying the story but I'm wondering if there is a Time Stories problem with this. Is it really a choose-your-own adventure, or is it more on rails where you have to do things in the correct sequence and while you are sandboxedly exploring you're really just trying to find the optimal path. I guess time will tell.

Now that I have e few plays under my belt (2 with the print and play and half a dozen with the main game - mostly with my three boys) I’m totally amazed how good and well put together 7th Continent is.  

The replayability of the material keeps it fresh, and its still fun even if you are replaying the same portion of the island.  (Its like covering old ground, but you have to be efficient...  so sometimes you deliberately skip actions to keep your mission on track.  On the second time through you may realise you “need” to investigate those skipped actions)

The story and Art is addictive and keeps you engaged.  

And I haven’t even tried the other curses yet!

I really appreciate the amount of work made here with the numbered cards, etc... everything is right and makes you think that you are in an adventure, but the game play is too repetitive I lost interest after 3 hours doing the same turn after turn... It's only an okay game but with tons of hype it's going to be a top 25 of BGG. 

Not for me.

After almost 10h into the game I can say that I love it! I love how the game implements 'choose your own adventure' mechanism but at the same time still feels like a proper board game where you need to think about your actions and not only choose A or B and move on. 
You need to be smart to survive on the continent. You need to rest and eat. Take care of your injuries and be prepared for any eventuality. We learned that the hard way - losing our first scenario very quickly. I hope it won't get boring and will keep me engaged like it does now.

That being said it's not for all. It's an exploration game so mostly you walk, explore new tiles, search for clues, search for food and items, read lots of climatic descriptions and so on. So, it might get tedious and boring for some. It certainly requires right mood and attitude.

Where do I begin? Wow. This game has a lot of things going for it. It feels kind of like Friday mixed with TIME Stories mixed with Tales of the Arabian Nights kind of. The game takes a really long time to complete. Our first game took 6 individual plays (roughly 2-2.5 hours each) and we lost :( but we had a great time and will be better prepared for the next run!

I love the variability that can happen (in fact sometimes I wish there was more!) At this stage anything 7th continent that actually adds to gameplay (not worried about mats, special dice, etc.) will be an insta-buy for me.

Kickstarter edition with bone dice

sleeved

Well well well. I've waited a long time for this.
But when I got it it stood on the shelf for almost one and a half months until I first played it.

The game itself is pretty heavy, the box is totally stuffed (I have everything that was avalable in the first Kickstarter) and the artwork is pretty cool.

The downside is the card quality: Better cards would have made the game more expensive, yes, but for a card game the cardstock is pretty bad. No, it isn't really bad it is much more... vulnerable.

The gameplay is less a game and more a choose-your-own-adventure.
Well designed. Very hard. I'm looking forward to playing this beast more often.

Première Curse pas réussi. on est mort après avoir trouver la statue. L'aventure est engageante et donne envie de rejouer. Le save fonctionne bien, mais il faut toutefois ranger tous les cartes, soit au début de la prochaine partie ou la fin de la parti en court. C'est long a faire et difficile à faire à plusieurs de manières efficace.

Absolut genius. I really like exploring games and this is by far the best. Even if the continent has been revealed, there's so much chaning in follow up games due to curses and events, that no game is the same. I really really love this one!

Probably comes closest to giving an "RPG-feel" than any other board game I know of. Never have I played a game where I feel I can do so much: hunt for food, gather seaweed, build a raft, look over a cliff, swim across the bay, search the forest, go into that cabin, etc. 

My husband found the unstructured nature of the game frustrating (he kept asking "what are we even trying to do?") but I thought it was a refreshing change from the many linear text-based "narrative" board games we've played. 

With that said, the game has some issues. The constant output randomness can be frustrating, and feeding/resting takes so much time and effort that it keeps you from doing what you really want to do: explore. Finally, the time investment is a little too much for me, since it can take several hours to play through just one curse, and there are so many other games I want to play in addition to this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great game.  Love the adventure aspects of it and the action deck is a very clever design.  You eventually learn the secrets of the island, so there is a limited number of times that you can play the game, but it is a lot of fun getting there.

A very cleverly, even beautifully, designed game. But I found it to grow tedious after just a few hours. Absolutely everything you do in the game, including simply moving, requires doing a skill check, and I found myself dreading the idea of losing and starting over and having to go through all those dozens and dozens of skill checks again. A certain amount of busy work is also required (hunting) just to keep the game going, and bad luck there will sink you. 

I would have enjoyed it more with a check point system, adventures tuned to not require hunting (i.e. you just have the N cards in the action deck and that's it), or adventures that only take 3-4 hours to complete, rather than 10+. 

Sold.

RATING: 8
Wow, this is truly about the greatest feat I've seen in game design, with well over 1,500 unique games played under my belt! The epicness of content here, and how it's all presented and structured is truly a marvel of game design.

For me, it's a bit hard to rate, though. Based on sheer appreciation and admiration of what was created here, it's a solid 10. However, I also prefer games that I can play in one sitting, and many of the scenarios are 10+ hour affairs, so the likelihood of me playing this one any more than maybe once per year is low, and I'd really have to be in the mood to undertake such a thing, making it a 6 or so on the BGG scale. So, I'll settle the rating in the middle.

I love how every scenario is played on the exact same map, but you'll only experience a small fraction of the map each game. It means that in one scenario, you might cross a section of the map that you remember traveling through in a previous scenario, and over time, you'd become almost familiar with the entire map layout, with different parts of the map playing very different important levels from scenario to scenario. It definitely takes some discipline on the part of the group to stick with what you think you need for the current scenario vs. just wandering around and exploring!

I'll also say, that while my first game was a great experience, I can definitely see the possibility of the game turning into a real grind if you end up exploring in the wrong direction, or things just don't go well. We finished the Icy Maze in a snappy 6 hours, but I can also see coming away with a much less enthusiastic experience if we had wandered around for hours on end, not finding what we were looking for.

Like I said, truly a marvel, and it's obvious this is a real labor of love by the designers. If I could give them more than two thumbs up, I would.

RATING: 7.5
This game is fantastic and perhaps the best exploration game ever designed. It's evocative and reminiscent of the video game Myst.

It does approach tedium though as you have to manually sort and organize cards constantly. I fear when the magic wears off all of the busy work and fiddliness will overwhelm. At 7 hours in, I'm not approaching that state yet though.

---------------------------------------------------

Still feel like I'm far from being able to review this game after close to 8 hours with it. In the last session, we found a secret passage which felt like a shortcut based on cues earlier in the game. Taking this secret passage cut  us off from returning from where we came and ended up dumping us out of the way. We had to backtrack through terrain we had already been in and spent an hour and a half of a wasted session just getting back to where we started. Beyond frustrating.

We also were forced to use the 777 card at this point (an "easy" mode the game suggests on your first curse) or we would have lost and had to restart, losing hours of progress and having to start over. I can't imagine actually losing after all of this invested time and feeling good running back through the game. I hate to say it, but I think we'll cheat if this happens again before we beat it - since our 777 card is gone and we can't legally use it anymore.

The above experiences caused me to drop my rating and it may drop further as I contemplate this more. Very unsatisfying experience.

Great narrative and theme, excellent graphic design and artistic aesthetic.  The card based mechanics are used to create a lot of interesting choices and ideas.  Every once in a while, card management gets a little onerous, and there are a lot of complexities and rules to keep track of (playing with a buddy helps!).

The game can be played in short sessions, or long chunks,cooperatively, or alone with very little set up time.

There's a ton of content in the box, and the whole mechanic lends itself very easily to updates, expansions and new adventures.

A fantastic game over all, certainly worth the time investment for me!

Great idea for a game, and well executed.

but...
* the main game mechanic is rather dry; just keep drawing cards to collect stars. Not interesting, few actual decisions
* this is a solo game. Works well with a book or a video game, but as a board game it isn't that great of an experience. Additional players do not really add anything to the game. 
* replay value is low, and sudden death after xx hours of grinding kills the fun
* and my wife didn't like it at all, just thought it plain boring. And since I'm not into solo boardgames, that's what killed it in the end for me. But it's not like I would shed bitter tears after the few hours experience I already had.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game is fun enough but with little longevity in my opinion, this is negated by the extra curse packs avalible but it is already an expensive game.

The art work on the map is good the rest of the art work (skill cards, player boards) is poor.

The translation to English on the cards has some grammatical errors (never though I'd be bothered by this type of thing) such as words not being abbreviated which makes the story a bit jarring in places.

The game is fine and if you like choose your own adventure books and have the time and money to invest in this then you'll like it, for me the reward is not there for time invested.

8/15/2017 - I'm three attempts in to the first Curse/Quest and this game is incredibly epic.  I fully anticipate failing completion once again but have learned so much about the "continent" and expect to defeat it with a fourth attempt.  (Maybe I'll get lucky with my current expedition).

There's a great deal of cleverness here. I expected to like it a great deal; instead... it was all right? I love exploration and discovery, but for some reason this didn't click with me nearly as much as I'd hoped, and I don't know why. Perhaps it'll grow on me if I give it another go?

(The only thing I actually disliked was the constant necessity for declaring who was in/out of a particular action..)

So much potential. But poor design decisions just killed this. There certainly is a lot of innovation here, and the exploration is fun. But the actual mechanisms of the game are a grind, especially when re-starting after dying. The fact that you have to reset the game to the beginning when you die after 10-20 hours of playing is fatal to this game. We've put in maybe 30 hours of total playtime into the game, and have yet to finish the introductory scenario. I don't care to play again.

Bloody brilliant game. Took a while to get going even though the rules are quite clear and understandable but it's just so different. Once up and running it's very easy to play. Lots of decisions and just the right amount of angst when you realize that you deck/life is running low and you're still not close to the solution.

Fantastic as a solo game, not sure I'd play it with more players and in that case probably two players max. Might be wrong though as I haven't tried it.

Also, the ability to save your game at any moment is a nice feature. Easy to do too.

Update: Gets a bit clunky at times, still a very cool idea..

Quite an interesting Solitario cooperative game. The rules are a bit vague and I find myself trying to track down the answers to some questions. Since this is a story driven game it's quite hard to find answers though. Otherwise quite an interesting  and unique experience

A nice effort but honestly light years away from some of the very good Adventure/RPG games + books. Very bad with three or four players. 

The game comes with some clever mechanics but some of the concepts are simply not to my liking (like the absolutely insane combinations of items which make no sense at all).

I honestly want Star Saga Clathran Menace back.

The adventure and exploration packaged in this game are simply great. The rules system is simple, packs some tension, and has amazing flexibility to all sorts of narrative situations.
Yes, the game can be quite long, but the save system allows you to break it up into manageable chunks.
If I had to pick one negative - it would be that the length of the campaign makes dying (and starting over) somewhat harsh given the time investment involved. Fortunately the community appears to have come up a few ways to approach this, I just have to find one that works for me and doesn't 'break' the tension behind the game.

Beautifully done game with lots of details. The cards are exceptional and the hints,  clues, and puzzles are very well done. It is definitely immersive, well thought out, great storytelling, and a unique game.

I've played the base game with the Voracious Goddess (VG) curse twice now for somewhere around 8 - 10 hours, and have not solved it yet. However, I'm pretty confident that I would have a great chance of success on the third time through as I now know pretty much what needs to be done. (I have been to the final location and back tracked to achieve one prerequisites with a pretty solid idea where to go to from there.)

That all being said, I found the VG curse as the first curse to be a bit much for my personal tastes for an initial play through. We got to the final location the 2nd time through only to find out we needed to go back and meet some prerequisites. It was fun, but at some points a bit long and tedious.

I don't know anything about the other curses (either in the base game and the 3 unopened expansions I have from the original kickstarter), but would love to see a rating on length and difficulty. Admittedly that would be a bit subjective. I would prefer some shorter and easier curses to get the hang of the game before delving into a 10+ hour session.

Fantastic flavorful adventure full of mystery, suspense and surprises. It is choose your own path, exploration, survival game in it's essence with a lot of details to discover. In 9 hours we haven't finished the first curse and there's 5 more to come. We love it.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Drawing cards from the deck which represent your entire energy to determine the outcome and then keeping one of the cards in your hand (discarding the rest). That is brilliant thematic example of how characters are learning by both success and failure.

RATING: 9
Original Rating: 7

First session lasted an hour before I died, at that point, felt the game was too random without many meaningful decisions (the way I died was unexpected and rather hilarious). My 2nd session I played more conservatively and not charge at everything I see, but managed my hand, food, inventory, etc. more effectively - voila~ game became a lot more fun!

There still isn't a lot of meaningful brain burny decisions - but this isn't really the game for that. Much like another kickstarter game I played recently (This War of Mine), it's really about the narrative and experience.  You just have to roll with it and accept that your decisions and choices will have some randomness thrown in and that's what you end up getting really. An adventure. 

The way I'm engrossed in my character and the story changed my original score of 7 to a 9 - unsure of the replayability, hence not a 10. But the way the save system works, you can play as long (or as short) as you want, and that's really a plus in my book.

One hint - when the game asks you to draw - don't just always take the first few cards in the decks of the same number and then place it back. Always worth it to take all cards (of the same number) out and shuffle it before drawing. Trust me on this.

Kickstarted this game and it's fantastic.  Still working on my first curse but it's basically a giant choose your own adventure game but with amazing component quality (minis are small I guess), tons of replayability (7 full curses that each take 10+ hours from what I head), and amazing game design.  There are so many small little design choices that make this game so amazing.  You will just constantly be impressed by all the little details they thought of... and the save system is just so well done.  Definitely recommend it although if you don't like choose your own adventure books this will not be your cup of tea.

Charming. This game is absolutely charming. That's the word that kept coming to mind for the experience it created. At one point I realized the artwork was not just art but was giving me visual clues as to what was actually around my character. After the game I realized I should've used the enclosed magnifying glass to look more closely at the map. I think it's telling me which way to go.

The sense of mystery of waking up on a strange island and having no idea where to go or how the hell to get off it was great. One of the best adventure games I've ever played, perhaps THE best. Crafting new items and deciding how to use them is a lot of fun as is trying to figure out just how the hell to get off the island.

The gameplay is so unique that even though it's quite simple, it took a while to get my head around it because it was just different than anything I've played before. Very neat card-based system.

Just finished a learning game where I made some mistakes and corrected as I went along. I did NOT survive, heh. Can't wait to get back to give it another try. I'm excited to show my friends, but it plays super solo for that sense of being isolated and having to figure everything out yourself.

RATING: 10
Not completely new (TIME Stories, Tales of the arabian nights) yet a complete revolution. A non-identified boardgame which deserves to be played at least once in your life to discover a new facet of bordgaming (as Concept  for example).

It leaves you a complete sensation of freedom with really smart ideas well implemented. The mechanisms, possibilities and level of intrication makes the game a real "open world" game  with a feeling similar to the last Zelda on the switch.

It will not please everyone as it clearly is an uncommon game but for someone adhering to the concept of the game, it is a trully beautiful piece of art made by master gamecrafters. The serious poulps have found a splendid gravy train and can mine the same vien for a long time with endless possibilities.

No much of a game but a pleasant experience. Once again more style than substance and those who bought into it will no doubt defend it vociferously; but it’s just a bit average. Plus the constant rerunnning of a curse is infuriating and dull.  I didn’t love the mechanic in Time Stories, but here you could be throwing 3 hours of gameplay down the toilet.

Viel Spielmaterial mit einfach zu wenig gutem Content.
Man wird künstlich hingehalten und muss immer den gleichen kram nochmal durchkauen.
Kaum Abwechslung durch die flüche da die Flüche nur aus 2 Karten bestehen.
Ein Spiel wie Kaugummi.
Wenn man zudem noch raus gefunden hat wie man nicht mehr durch Deck-tot sterben kann dann ist es noch öder...

Man hätte soooo viel besseres draus machen können aber leider haben sie das hier draus fabriziert..... Schade drum.

Just started playing (after about 4 hours) The amount of work that was put into this game is just crazy. We are really enjoying exploring the continent and trying to solve the various puzzles and problems. The game can be long but as long as you split it up and don't play too many hours in one session I think this will remain a great game for a while to come. Once we have finished the curses I am not sure how much more playing time it will see until new curses come out. But even with just the current 7 available curses we may play this game more than any other in our collection.

This game was tailor made for me.  I am a 'choose your own adventure' fan.

The action system, item combinations, map building, amount of searching and discovery you can do, it all adds up to a completely enjoyable experience for me.

I've already died, but see the value in exploring all that you can in a certain area and then moving on, noting what is useful and what is not, so when you die and start over you know what to not waste time on.

In addition, there are some places that make obvious save points that I could see using as starting points if I died so that I didn't have to redo everything.  We'll see.

Feels like a classic point and click adventure game. It's amazing how easy the rules are and how well they translate to the exploration feel. I'm intrigued to find everything the game has to offer and I hope the game replay ability will hold up.

This game is ridiculously big, thoroughly enjoying what I'm seeing so far. So simple gameplay and so much content to go through. The save mechanic is brilliant!

Update: To be honest I don't think I will ever play this game as intended. There's too much grind to trace back your steps after you die so I'm playing with house rules for losing the game: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1843540/avoid-grind-easier-variant-house-rule

Second update: After finishing 2 of the curses, I don't really feel like going back. Yes, it's a great ride discovering the continent but just like any other choose-your-own-adventure type of system, once you've been trough it and seen 80% of the content, it's too much work to go back for the other 20%. I'm sure there are areas I have not seen yet but at this point I'm not willing to sit though hours of already explored sections just to get to them.

This is a heck of a game. Lots to uncover. I would agree with reviews that it's a choose your own adventure type feel. During our first 4 player playthrough we got past the first third of the curse (Voracious goddess) pretty quickly, but we got cocky. And that was our downfall. But fun game and everyone enjoyed it. I'd bet we got about halfway through the first curse before losing, and it took us about 4 hours.

So far I felt that the game would be best played with one player, it really feels like game play with more than one is cumbersome and unnecessary. The game feels railroaded so far...yes there are choices but they ultimately end up pointing you in a particular direction or pattern, Im not sure if this will improve with more plays. This feels like a more elaborate version of Unlock to me. The icons and elements in the game were perhaps too numerous and redundant and the equipment cards seemed overly complicated. I also felt that there was no real danger or threat, nothing to keep me on edge while the game was going on (and thus no excitement). Aside from this I do think there are some interesting things going on such as the card details, card placement, and the game save system...though I'm not sure if they are enough to carry the game through.

Kickstarted. Arrived August 2017.

[b]Top 5 thoughts:[/b]

1. This is an epic exploration/survival game.

2. It's the only game I've ever happily played solo.

3. It does an excellent job of regularly piquing your curiosity, but is so unforgiving that you often can't afford to indulge that curiosity.

4. It is extremely difficult: there are few markers to reassure you that you're on the right path; bad luck or oversight can put the game in an unwinnable state (sometimes without you even realising).

5. I've tried this two-player, but in my opinion it does not work well multiplayer, mainly because there are dozens of micro-decisions you are constantly having to make that are just easier/quicker made alone. (My bias: I rarely like co-op games.)

[b]How I felt spending ~20 hours cracking the first curse:[/b]

First full solo play through of the Voracious Goddess curse, across two sessions (on easy mode): Clearly this is brilliant, I find myself hungering to go back and explore more. It was a little fiddly, to the point that I think I'll stick to solo play for now, and frustrating that curiosity meant I burned through my action deck super fast and died just when I felt I was really getting somewhere, but totally worth it for the feeling of adventuring in a richly detailed and dangerous world. I'm keen to give it another try - next time I'll try using two characters and being more single-minded about winning.

Second solo play through, Voracious Goddess easy mode with two characters this time, and again I burned through my deck early. Annoyingly I found loads of food just after depleting the deck first time - i.e. too late. This game can be pretty unforgiving. Still enjoying it enough to want more - eventually I guess I'll be familiar enough with the map to make a beeline for the useful bits.

Third solo attempt at the Voracious Goddess (normal mode). I looked at an online hint so this time I started with a different character, and worked out how you're *supposed* to get off the first island. Both of which (along with just being more experienced, I guess) meant I was managing my cards MUCH better. During my second session I went on an unfortunate detour in some kind of death cavern - I had to turn back and came out alive but somewhat depleted. But then - yay - I finally found the Voracious Goddess... and discovered that's probably only the first third of the mission. Third session, I went in what I thought was the right direction - nothing there. Frustrated, I wandered about a bit and died. I enjoy the exploration aspect, but am beginning to find it annoying that you're so punished for inefficiency that you can rarely follow through on the fun stuff you find. I'm not massively relishing having to redo the whole first bit now, although at least there are enough options that I can try and do it a little differently.

Solo attempt four (normal mode). Experimented with getting off the first island by raft this time, and bent the rules for the sake of satisfying my exploratory curiosity. Ended the first session lost. Second session, I continued being slightly more casual with the rules, and got back on track. Third session, went in the direction I thought I should, and found nothing, which annoyed me sufficiently that I looked online for a clue again - it turns out I’d just taken a wrong turning. Having to take clues makes me feel dumb, but I enjoy knowing I’m at least vaguely on track, and the game doesn’t tell you. Aaaand, fourth session, I FINALLY found the first [significant quest item], and promptly died.

Solo attempt five (normal mode), determined to be super efficient. Session one, got off the island and made a beeline for where I believed the second [significant quest item] to be. I was right. (Although at one point I did peek a card ahead to be sure.) It is increasingly clear that making maps/notes and using knowledge from previous attempts is essential for success - if you know something, use it, even if your character didn't discover it on this particular outing. Session two, went straight to pick up the first [significant quest item] again, but I had two runs of bad luck and died AGAIN. Fed up now, so I allowed myself to be invincible, skipped to the Voracious Goddess and lifted the curse.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
This game is incredibly ambitious, and almost completely successful. Despite finding it occasionally annoying, I'm glad to have had an opportunity to explore this game. I can see myself tiring of it eventually, but I will have got a lot of juice from it by then.

Incredible game and really fun. I play it solo and will lose track of time since I get so caught up in mystery and exploration.  This game is extremely polished and well designed.  The storage solution that comes in the box is probably one of the best I have ever seen in a card/boardgame. The rulebook is clear and concise. I backed this on kickstarter and was very impressed with the campaign.  The designers listened to feedback and made smart improvements to the game and the final product is now a well oiled machine.

French language edition

Excellent concept, beautiful art. 

The first KS was almost a year late, the cardboard while pretty is not sturdy enough: corners of the cards tend to get damaged the thicker board needs to be handled with extreme care which is something I cannot do myself. On the other hand, it was overproduced with minis and a pointless discard box (I would have preferred the postcard they offered as a promo in 2015 or nothing). The weather expansion also has some huge not very practical standees which, if assembled, no longer fit in the box.

So, my cards will be all sleeved eventually, they fit quite well in an IKEA box. I also decided to lacquer the thicker cardboard and now it is almost sturdy enough.

Great, beautiful game, not so good implementation, limited replayability.

Rating after three (each ca. 3.5 hours of) play. The game goes on like you are  gently rowing down a big slow river.  Nice to look at everything but not really exciting.
 An adventure game like this must be strong on the story and its unfold during the game; I think this is the weak point of the game. Many and good written flavor texts, but not much story (Bloody Hunt Curse).

Just started playing, Voracious Goddess, left tutorial island on session 1, now in forest/swamp/mountain session 2 & 3. But for sure delivers everything as I expected it to be:

- great artwork and "adventure feel" (especially with free soundtrack in the background)
- always curious to look and discover things
- nice riddles, clues, hidden numbers, suprises, but not too hard (so far)
- saving and continuing works good

I am normally not a coop or solo player, but this got me hooked. At the moment a solid 10 (will always enjoy playing), might go down a bit once I know the continent very well, but for now I am exploring (and surviving) with my eyes sparkling with joy...

Good exploration game. The card mechanism for life, skill-checks and crafting items works nice. It creates some amount of deck/hand management. Once you get a feel for the game you start to know when to play it safe and when to gamble. But the game is mostly about the exploration. Once you've been through an area that part of the continent looses a lot o replayability. The game can't stand on it's own just by it's mechanisms. So once the exploration element goes away, the game just becomes repetetive. But there really is no other game like this.

The game has one big issue for me though:
Dying halfway through a curse that takes a long time to complete is highly anti-climactic.
It's not fun enough to replay all the hours you've spent to get to the point where you died. The card mechanism isn't interesting enough to warrant spending time on that. But just ignoring death and continuing on removes any challenge from the game.
Repeated plays with new curses will also have you exploring some of the areas that you've already explored in previous curses, which will reduce the replayability of the game.

RATING: 8.5
It's no secret that I'm a fanboy for survival games, and there really aren't a whole lot of them in the board game world unfortunately. One of the things I really like about these games is acquiring items and having to puzzle out how to keep in the game until I get more items as well as having to weigh the effects of how to spend my resources when I have multiple options. 7th Continent really excels at this in particular because you do have many options as to what you could be doing and there's a layer of murkiness as to what is most important that I find oh-so palatable

The other appeal of 7th Continent is how much game is actually here. For contrast, I think euro games really struggle solitaire because there isn't a whole lot to explore or react to; you don't have other players to play off of or adapt to - you just have the game mechanics as-is and can only hope they can maintain your interest over multiple plays. 7th Continent counteracts this by giving you a ton of variety and making that variety first-class. The gameplay is also on the light-medium side making the entire experience very manageable for the long sessions it asks for. I really like it and can see it going up with more play

Best with 1-2

I really like this system!  Most things do what you think they do, and it's a really flexible way of creating an interesting narrative.  Player choices really matter, and the negotiation among players as to what to do was very enjoyable in our group. The fact that you can't explore everything makes the world feel bigger. I enjoyed this a lot and I'm looking forward to playing more. (1 play, first 2 hours)

Rating fell with every play session. Started very strong, compelling story, fun events. After many hours it became a frustrating experience with repeated events that were now tedious and not enjoyable. If it makes it to PC or tablet app will happily try again, as all the procedural tasks are far better handled by an automaton than a person.

Suggestions of improvement for those setting out on their first adventure. Add no generic blank curse cards to the action deck and put in all four pictured curses (and have all four clues). Banish all explore events (don't discard them to the past) so you don't recycle them. If they run out, good, you'll get the adventure done faster.

Absolutely fantastic cooperative adventure game. Excellent production values and attention to detail, wonderful interplay of mechanics and theme, and a compelling, show-don't-tell narrative. This puts me in mind of choose-your-own-adventure novels in a really good way.

After we finish an adventure or two, this might end up getting bumped to a ten depending on how repayable it turns out to be (EDIT: Very. So yes, it's a straight-up 10). I eagerly await more expansions, and possibly other stories with the same mechanical setup (in particular, it seems like a Dark Souls edition would be flavorful as hell).

Do your research before you buy. Not everyone is going to like this - it's much different than any other board game and feels more like it owes its DNA to long-form exploration or survival video games like Myst, Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Don't Starve. If you want to continually feel helpless and underprepared for the occasional moment of elation when you pull the right card or find a new solution, then this might be the game for you.

my wife and I love this game. Still playing the first curse and can't explore everything, because hunting/fishing options are limited, so I expect reasonable replayability using the different curses, but when using the same curses, events/locations and what you can find there will be familiar. 
Game does have some surprises if you revisit locations, so I expect some replaybility when using the same curses, but it would probably grow stale once you played everything several times.

Good part is that we've already spent several dozens of hours on the first curse and still haven't finished the first curse, so I expect to be able to enjoy this game for many years and perhaps at the end we might have forgotten the first curse and can start over again.

Surprisingly simple in concept and gameplay, but delivers a complex and engaging adventure unlike most other game that have tried this sort of narrative exploration. It really feels like playing a game of King's Quest or Myst with more engaging game mechanics--or like a Fighting Fantasy or Lone Wolf book with a more immersive, more free narrative. 

Replayability might be an issue (as once you've solved some puzzles, it'll be hard to forget them). But I imagine the metric ton of content that comes in the box will keep this game fresh for quite a while. A great game accomplishment, and a talented design.

Wasn't too impressed with the design after an extensive playtest at Spiel '15. Graphic design is really cool. The gameplay on the other hand lacks choice, planning, and variety in my opinion. For me it feels like Talisman. Either go this way or that way. And then we see what you get. Find loot? Or your death? Setup seems to be tricky as well. But maybe the biggest problem is the lack of story, because all players do is flip a card. 
Interesting enough, this game is trending in 2017 and has stellar ratings. Many 10 star ratings seem to come from Kickstarter backers...

Fun, fascinating game, but also a bit fiddly. The game surprised me by being more generic than I had thought it would be: Most of the cards you see when playing are not specific to the scenario being played.

Esta é a prova de que jogo legacy pode ser TODO REJOGÁVEL, o que era óbvio!! Basta boa vontade da editora e do designer e que a maioria dos consumidores optem pela compra de jogos duráveis somente. Prefiro um legacy de 700 reais que depois de jogado continua valendo, do que um de 200 reais que vira lixo.

Easy 10 after 60-90 minutes of Voracious Goddess. We'll see how it holds up after completing a curse or three.
After an 8-hour session and burning through the Skill cards, I lowered to a 9. Each character plays pretty similarly and the Skill deck doesn't really promote different playstyles. We'll see how my opinion changes after completing our first Curse and starting a second. It could drop to an 8 or rise back to a 10.
A third session complete. Restarted Voracious Goddess (so I have two different session running) with CJ. She absolutely loves it and claims it a 10. I still believe the repeatability will suffer as the Skill deck is pretty static and the few advanced skills available aren't WOW! Still holds with a solid 9 though!

The adventure game I had hoped all other adventure games would be. Tons of interesting details with plenty to explore, featuring a replayable world with different curses to defeat and tactical push-your-luck survival and action mechanics that feel fresh.

When I sat down to play 7th Continent for the first time, it felt like Christmas morning when I was a kid with a tree full of presents to open. Very few things in my adult life have given me such a pure feeling of glorious anticipation. And, while I have admittedly only scratched the surface of this game, that feeling persisted as I played, every card being another glittery, mysterious delight to unwrap. 

Mechanically, the game is simple once you get used to it. You take an action shown on the terrain card where your character is, on an exploration card next to your terrain card, or on a card in your tableau of skills, items, companions, and conditions. If playing with more than one player, the other player(s) can join you, throwing their items and abilities in to help improve or manipulate the results. Every action requires a test of drawing action cards (0 or more, depending) and getting a certain number of successes (0 or more, depending). If you fail, the failure result impacts all players who participated. The action card deck is also your life force, so the central tension in the game (besides looking around the next corner) is in drawing the fewest cards while getting the most successes. The deck is seeded with 4 generic curse cards + curse cards specific to the curses you are playing, added to about 35 action cards. If your action deck is depleted, you start drawing from the discard for actions. If you draw a curse card from the discard deck then you lose the game. The main way to replenish your action deck is to eat, so one must hunt with relative frequency to survive. Action cards are also skill cards and when you draw cards to complete an action you can keep one as a skill. You can also collect experience points during the game to trade them in for advanced skills at certain points, which not only grow your action deck, but also can give powerful items and new skills.

The seamless and innovative connection between actions, life force, and skills constitute the elegant mechanical heart of the game. The size of the continent, the consequential - but not outrageous - variation and the epic scope of exploration has no rival in board gaming. The writing and art are of the highest standard and create a fully immersive experience. This is the best adventure board game ever produced.

Kickstarter...  Supposed to arrive Oct 2016 - Arrived Aug 2017.  

Cool art.  Interesting concept... but ultimately, I found the experience to be less than what I had hoped it to be.  Not much decision making above trial and error.

The exploration element is fun, but that fades quickly when you have to repeat the mission often in order to make any headway.  Could have house-ruled it, I suppose, but just didn't feel worth it to me.

Also found the rules quite fiddly and the multi-player experience lacking.  

That's not to say this is a poor "game" --quotations used with purpose there-- but that it isnt the tabletop experience I usually look for to spend my time.

Currently a ten, but will depend on how replayable the game is after multiple attempts. The exploration and potential devastation makes for an amazing co-op experience. The experience is the selling point, and, being a possible double digit hour campaign, is definitely not for everyone. If you are a fan of choose your own adventure books and aren't scared of having hours poured into a loss, definitely check this game out.

Played the full demo (first 5% - 10%), excellent, backed immediately.

Played about 12 hours of the first curse - its a novel game, not without its problems, but ultimately not like anything else in the boardgame space and clearly a labour of love.

Recommended for a solo game - 2 at most.

Not sure what I want to rate this yet. Played about nine hours and I appreciate the experience (heck I even enjoy the experience), but it's not really a game. It's really a puzzle...a puzzle that challenges the min/max vs open world adventure parts of my brain.

I am nearly convinced I would love this game, but it really doesn't make any sense that I would have to pay more than $100 to get it. Considering the reception, this should be available commercially and the base game should cost no more than $80 msrp. 

Basically the poster child for everything wrong with Kickstarter.

The 7th Continent isn’t just a game about exploration, it is a gaming milestone for how exploration should be done. Most games confuse exploration for adventure, and the 7th Continent conflates them, and it is the epitome of exploration.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game is massive, and massively entertaining! I can't say I've ever played a game like it ever before, nor do I think many people could actually pull off a game like this.

I must say that this game is not competitive, not invigorating, not very complicated, and yet it is incredibly fun to play whether you have hours to spend or just a few minutes. I really doubt that I will ever sell my version of this game, since it is a game I simply don't see ever getting boring! The expansions add very nice, unique twists to the gameplay without taking away from the original game itself.

The nicest thing about this game BY FAR, is the quick-save feature. Serious Poulp have done an incredible job at making the saving system very quick, easy, and intuitive. Although a "full play through" can take 30+ hours, the quick-save system makes you forget that it will take so long, because you can play your adventure in as small or large of chunks as you want! With setup and take-down of only 30 seconds each, it's quicker than any other game I own...

This is a gamebook come to life with beautiful art and some cool stories. Unfortunately the exploration part which should be fun turns draggy after 8 hours or so. There are no short scenarios and the game takes even longer its your first time. I would've liked more puzzles and less luck (in terms of skill checks and finding items). e.g. in my 2nd game, I found 2 idols early on which made the game super easy.

My major gripe is the lack of clarity in the quests. Vague wordings may sound cool thematically, but in practice it does not work well. There's also quite a lot of sorting of cards and bookkeeping and the map can become too large to manage sometimes.

It certainly does not deserve its rating. It's an expensive game that has no true replayability. Also many decisions are not informed, and it feels like you're just messing around with a toy rather than actually going through a mental challenge. As many have said, this format suits well for a tablet App, certainly not for a physical card game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Probably best with 1-2 players and I'd rate it higher in those instances. With 3-4 it devolves a bit into community chit chat trying to make decisions although you are ultimately responsible for your own character's actions. However, with no set turn order, anyone can take an action at any time. This feels quite a bit like a choose your own adventure book set inside a game and it is interesting - at least at first. I'm not sure how often I would want to retrace my steps if I failed continually...Tons of cards and I am looking forward to exploring this more.

It very much is a choose your own adventure book in a board game format. If you don't like those, or point-and-click adventure games, or roguelikes (to borrow a few examples from video games) you might not like this. But if you enjoy a tough, puzzly adventure in a well-crafted world then this one is a treat.

It's amazing how much detail is contained in every aspect of the production: the writing, the art, the story... even the tiniest bit of seemingly innocuous flavor text could mean the difference between survival and doom in this game.

Time will tell if this one goes the distance for me but it's definitely an engaging experience and a lot of fun right now.

10/2017 Good consept and story telling.  Though it's basically a 'choose your own adventure' style book in game format.  And over time I guess the new format will be limiting and tedious with thousands of cards.  It's fun to tag long, but I wouldn't buy it - I'd stick with the book-format.

I played 2 sessions on one curse for about 8 hours. We are still not finished with that curse. It is a outstanding game. The possibility to save a game is great, but it is also a weakness of this game. You need to save the game to refresh certain card decks and the "map", for example hunting grounds and hunting loot especially food. Without refreshing the game you will not get any food, because you already used the cars. Without food you cannot restock a card deck, which represent your life points.

The game is just hyped.

It tries to combine the good sides of game books and RPGs. But it fails entirely, taking the worst of them.

Essentially it is just a Gamebook (that exists since forever) that develops in space, with island tiles.

Why so bad?
First, the story is underwhelming. There will never be the depth of a game book, or a true storytelling board game like Near and Far or an RPG. So if you look for immersion, and storytelling, look elsewhere.

It has cumbersome mechanics, and tons of useless skills that are useful only to show off, but that one can't really develop. In fact, characters' skills and development are boring: the strategy is the same whatever character you choose, apart from the fact that once you find a skill on your card, and once another. Nothing like a good game (like Cosmic Encounter) in which you have to use different strategies depending on the character.

Graphics is lame: the island tiles are ugly and grayish. For a game in which discovery is the main thing, they should have done much better.

Finally, there is not real strategy: just card flipping. One has mainly to learn what to do by failing a curse and start again. This was the biggest defect of Gamebooks. 
It was not solved at all. But at least Gamebooks did not require 10000 tiles and had much deeper stories.

Concluding, one does play a game here, rather it is the game that plays you. There is no freedom, in a game that wishes to be an RPG but it is not.

If you think this is a good game, and like the "deserted island theme" play Robinson Crusoe. Much faster, much deeper, much more thematic and consequential. Or just buy an old Gamebook. Both experiences will be better!

The most ambitious game I've ever played...there simply isn't anything like it anywhere. A rollicking adventure from start to finish, this is one of those "one more turn" games where you don't notice the hours tick by. Every card holds a mystery, tells a story, dares you to go further.  A must have for any fan of thematic games.

Exciting and adventurous. Rather an experience than a game, or if a game it really is one of its kind. Played for 10 hours now with the first curse (of four in the main box) and have not even half discovered the area of the 7th continent and my guess is: from all the secrets it contains we have discovered only a tiny fraction. And I backed it with all the expansions so there are still hours and hours of even more fun waiting. Would suggest playing it with a maximum of 2 players though as in its heart it is a solitaire game. Edit: updated from a 9 to a 10 after 40 hours of play and still enjoying tremendously. I love the puzzly aspect of crafting and combining items to pass the tests better and the constant surprises that still await in every corner of the continent.

This is really just a beautiful and unique game. The intricacy of the design is beyond anything I have seen in cardboard; truly impressive. The artwork is lovely and it really feels like a Jules Verne novel come to life. The iconography takes a second to wrap your head around, but it is a deceptively simple game. It is more of a storytelling experience than a strategy heavy game, but it is absolutely the best at what it does. I can't even wrap my mind around how they managed to bring this design to life.

Very cool, interesting, and unique at first...but starts to wear after a good 10-15 hours of play.  That's a lot of play, so not bad overall, but I'm itching to finish just so I can pull Gloomhaven back out.  My wife has been requesting Gloomhaven for a few weeks, but I feel like we need to finish this curse first.

Best solo game experience I've ever had. I've played games with solo rules that were never originally intended to be played solo, and they felt like the solo rules were an afterthought. This game feels like it was designed with all modes of play in mind. It's not a walk in the park as far as games go. It's a very decision intensive game, with heavy storytelling elements. I found it both refreshing and invigorating to play it for the first time. I look forward to playing it for years to come and to soon playing it with friends.

Pros:
- Hits a lot of the highs I loved from playing Zork, Zelda, Lone Wolf, etc. type games as a kid
- Setup and save system is super clever
- Has a sense of exploration and wonder that I've never encountered in a board game before
- Mechanically simple (listed here, because teaching and learning the game is a breeze)
- Blue and purple banners are really clever, though the ones encountered so far don't really seem to allow a branching storyline, just a "do
- Tons of game to chew through, plus mixing and matching party makeup and size can alter a story you've done already


Cons:
- Mechanically simple (listed here, as all actions essentially feel the same with the only difference being in the iconography)
- Randomization can cause "difficulty spikes" at inopportune times
- Fiddly as there are lots of cards and things to constantly rifle through
- Emphasis on story and discovery means that certain elements are intentionally obfuscated. This ambiguity can lead to spoiling the game (as you want to make sure you're doing things correctly), whereas a simply saying "this is a quest icon or this is used during the 'x' curse" story would have been fine

I realize that I'm probably giving this game a pass on things that would normally bump a game down on how much I want to play it, but these things are all incredibly minor compared to the amount of fun and (good) frustration you get in exploring The 7th Continent and its locations. Sharing stories of encounters and events with other gamers, using your wits and skills to overcome obstacles, or constantly looking out for secrets and hidden clues is not something I even think of when discussing board games and The 7th Continent brings all of that and more to the table.

Great first Impression, but it just doesn't have the mechanics to continue that way. pretty much 90% to 10% actual game mechanics.

Art work 10/10
Theme 10/10
Mechanics/ depth of play 2/10
Replay value 3/10

"Have you watched Rahdo 's updated final thoughts? He talks about the fact that the game is first and foremost a survival game, so you actually spend the majority of your time just hunting and eating. Also this means that the game is very long and we found that while trying to solve a clue we went entirely the wrong way for two sessions (5hrs gameplay) and just completely wasted our time when we started to get an idea of where we should be. Now if the game mechanics were interesting and engaging it wouldn't feel like wasted time you. But it does because there is about 15% mechanics holding together 85% theme here the depth of decision making is how many cards you want to wager for success and maybe after that what card might be most useful to craft for the future. But that's it nothing more. So think about the action deck is about 50 cards (+advanced ones) but you are going to just keep seeing those cards over and over and over again man. Also the when you die or go the wrong way you have to go back through the same areas again it is really really boring,  kinda like walk all the way back to the beginning in an Adventure game to try and find that one star you left behind so you get 100% on the level. "

Nothing like it. Was completely lost the first time through, died pretty quickly. Got better at exploring the second time - lasted a little longer - and the third time through, figured out how to survive - and fell like I nearly made it to the end...but didn't. Tense and fun and there's humor and adventure and discovery. Honestly - there is nothing quite like it. Probably will get compared to TIME Stories - but this is 1000x better - TIME stories is a one and done play and is just a grind and memory test. NOTHING like what this is -- different variations every time - with some overlap - but actually fun to play again instead of just a grind to get to the end. You could play on easy mode and regenerate instead of dying but I chose not to. More fun to get better at the game and get better at survival and get better at using the mechanics that the game provides. And the art - wow - essential to the story - lots of little details and clues that seem like window-dressing until a few times through and you have an epiphany...oh -- that's what certain things are. The game's best gift is the sense of discovery it gives you. Nothing like it.

May well be one of my last Kickstarter backings because of lateness.  I don't like this ordering mechanism.

The game itself has been an awful lot of fun at this point.  Played a few turns solo, then with my family and we had one hilarious disaster after another.  Played with Bartel last night and we both had a good time, and very excited to see what will happen next.  The artwork is great, the tension is good.  Not deeply strategic or anything but for someone who loved the ''çhoose your own adventure" books, this is great stuff.

Superb game. Excellent with the family, solitaire or anywhere in between. Easy to deal players into or out of the game and the unique save system makes it the easiest game to set up, take down and set back up again that I have ever encountered. Works with gamers of differing experience levels too. Keeps you wondering what's around the next corner and wanting to poke your nose into everything even when you have a fair idea it won't end well for your character.

I kickstarted this, and I can easily say it's one of the best games I've played in a while. I played the starter curse with 1 friend, and we died. I then played it again with 2 friends and had a totally different experience. I'm not sure how much replayability each curse has, since some of the key events are semi-scripted, but there are many curses and decisions to make, plus the characters you choose change the game as well. All in all, money definitely well spent and I highly recommend it. Also, the save system is very elegant and useful, plus new people can join mid-way through. Both very good features to have. :D

A gorgeous and ambitious production. As someone who owned all the Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks available during my childhood, this is really nostalgic. If I do have any criticisms it's that it's perhaps a bit -too- much like a fighting fantasy or choose your own adventure. 

These old eyes find the cards a little bit hard to read when they are on the table, even with the magnifying glass. I might see if I can get an A4 sized one made out of the same material.

I never liked 'Choose-Your-Own-Adventure' books. After my first few forays into reading them I used to just flip through and read every page that finished with 'THE END'. That's basically how I feel about 7th Continent: I'd be more satisfied to read all the cards out one-by-one and then pack the game up for trade/sale. It would save me hours upon hours of frustration and boredom.

We played about 10 hours of it and had a great time! A wonderful ambience, great and innovative use of cards for all your actions, items, maps, etc. What sets it back a little for me is the continuous (non-value-adding) work of looking for cards by number, sorting them back in, shuffling. It's not a problem at the beginning, but after hours of play, it becomes tiresome.

This is a really clever game. I've been unable to sit down and commit a lot of time playing to it, so I cannot speak to replayability. The one campaign I have played probably 15+ hours on has been extremely fun, and if I had the time to continue it I would prefer to play it over any other game in my collection.

The 7th Continent is a cooperative exploration game.  Players move their pawns around an ever-expanding map board, overcoming challenges, discovering new places, and gradually uncovering the mystery of the world.  Everything is driven by a check system, where you are given some threshold, and draw some number of cards to see if you get enough stars on the cards to pass the check.  Some of these cards can then be kept as items the players found along the way.  However, when the deck of cards runs out, that triggers the end of the game, so players are encouraged not to stick around and look at everything.  Describing the mechanics really sells the game short though--this game is all about discovery and narrative.  Players are constantly being forced to make interesting choices, and in doing so, find out various things about the overarching story.  While I'm generally not a fan of cooperative games, this doesn't really scratch the board game itch as it does the discovery itch--I just can't wait to find out more about the world.

If Jumanji and a chose your own adventure novel had a love child, you would get the 7th continent.  The system is wonderfully simple  (From setup to saving the game) while offering a uniquely complex adventure that we did not want to put down once we had started playing.  There is so much depth and complexity that has been rendered beautifully on all the cards through art, flavor text, and interaction that we have been wowed every time we've put the game out to play.  If you are looking for a game that tells you what you do to win, 7th continent is not for you, but if wide open adventure calls your name then go explore that continent!

[floatleft][ImageID=2642016 tiny][/floatleft][b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
I say this with absolute certainty: 7th Continent (7th C) is one of the most cleverly designed games I have ever seen/played. I am so happy I KickStarted this game.

[b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
I am a player who tends to ignore the narrative of a game. I gravitate more towards mechanisms over theme and I usually skip over flavor text. With that said, 7th C is the most robust narrative game I have ever played. The narrative just smacks you right in the face. When I play this game I feel like I am playing out a story and the narrative just writes itself in my mind. I have never felt like that about any other game.

Growing up I remember reading those choose your own adventure books where you would encounter a decision and have to skip to page X or Y for the outcome. It was a fun little gimmick to try to solve the "puzzle" of the book to get the good outcomes. Clearly the designers of 7th C took inspiration from these books. 7th C feels like a choose your own adventure board game which introduces random elements.

One of the downsides of the choose your own adventure books was that it was set in print and had no random elements. If you were to reread the book and were to make all of the same decisions the final outcome would be identical to the previous read. As a board game 7th C adds random elements which gives variety. 

The way 7th C handles random encounters using the adventure deck is ingenious design. I love the cleverness of the adventure deck where cards could be land, encounters, random items, status effects, etc. The thing that absolutely blew my mind is how the gold backed cards could replace the green backs and thereby alter the state of the game forever. On top of that the gate system of the banner mechanism that acts lock and key to other avenues of the island really makes this system shine. This is what pushed 7th C from a 9 to a 10 for me. 

I also really enjoy the push your luck element of 7th C. Each action tests how much you are willing to risk to save the precious cards in the action deck. Some actions you will want to gaurentee a success so you will need to commit more cards which will drain your card pool faster while other checks you might be willing to risk failing so you commit less. 7th C is basically an optemization puzzle and you have weigh the risks versus rewards with every decision you make. 

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
Every game is not without flaws and 7th C is no exception. My biggest gripe with the game is the dependency on hunting to sustain the action deck. Thematically I wholeheartedly understand what the designers were striving to achieve but the tedium of moving from one hunting ground to another seems to over shadow the overall Curse objective. 

I think my biggest concern for this game is replayability once the novelty wears off. In some aspects 7th C reminds me of a rogue-like where you push as far as you can and when you die you have to start from the beginning. I have died a couple times already which forced me to start from the beginning and each time I have felt like the movie Groundhog day where I know how things are going to play out but I am striving for the best possible outcome. Some elements of the game will always be the same every play through, other aspects will be a weighted decision if the risk is worth the reward and other part will just be completely random and you just have to hope for the best. Time will tell...

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
Its hard to write a review about this game without divulging spoilers. Overall it's apparent that I am enamored with 7th C. I have solely been playing this game solitaire and have been using the save mechanism for every play session. I think this makes the game harder for me but I enjoy the challenge. I am savouring the experience and I doubt I will get bored with this game any time soon. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a remarkable boardgame conversion of old style choose-your-own-adventure games, helped by evocative art and a mechanical system which is simple and effective. I have enjoyed the game and find myself wanting to play it regularly, but I recognise that it has its downsides.
There is an unfortunate similarity to TIME Stories in that you will most likely have to do the whole darned thing over again... and again. The 'save game' feature is more of a 'pause game', whereas what is really needed is a 'save and reload from this point' feature, as trudging over the same ol' same ol' is fairly time consuming and not as exciting as the initial exploration.
The first quest, Curse of the Voracious Goddess does give you a good-ish map to go on, but there is still a lot of aimless wandering, which leads to what has been probably my biggest criticism: it's too darned expensive to get anywhere. Without a Walking Stick (or similar), moving from card to card very quickly drains the Action deck (aka your life-force) making the game one of remembering where to go on a re-run and optimising that route, rather than an exciting exploration. And you're not guaranteed to get a walking item at all unless you churn through the deck, which then forces you to go hunting and fishing with quite variable rewards.
OK, it's a board game, not a computer game, I can 'fix' this issue myself easily enough, but I do find it a detriment to the overall enjoyment of the game.  A tremendous achievement, with some issues, but still fun.

RATING: 3
- 3 for the hunts after 50 plays. They're just unsufferable and represent 60% of the game.
I give up on this thing. Every play's the same: get stuck hunting for 3 sessions on a 6 card area, not achieving anything.
Unbrearable.

EDIT: Hunts ruin the game for me. They take too much playtime, and too much resource, and unfortunately are your main source of replenishing your action deck, even by the end of the game.
I would have liked more variety in foraging, fishing, drinking water, resting, talking, and so on.
There are other ways but they're seldom and not reliable.

As for curses:
- The Bloody Hunt is very very good.
- The Black Box is unreplayable troll.
- The Voracious Goddess is a time-consuming interesting adventure.
- The Offerings takes many resources and prevent your growth as a character but sounds interesting.

Formerly: Succeeds as an adventure, but fails as a game. Sudden death is too punishing for the time invested in the game. Doing everything over and over and over and over is a pain and not interesting. The action deck mechanism doesn't work.

SP wanted to make both a gamer's game and an adventure story. Both those parts work independantly. But they don't mix together well.

Very disappointed.

I really wanted to like this game,  but I just didn't.  I spent many hours on a curse looking for certain items,  but all I found was frustration and disappointment.  I have finally accepted the fact that I'm neither patient enough nor *gulp* smart enough to solve the vague clues presented in this game.  

If you're someone who is patient and good at solving vague clues, then you may enjoy this game.  However, if you're not good at those things, run far away from this game lest you be cursed with frustration and disappointment, too.

I admire the effort and detail that goes into making such a large game, but it is hard for me to justify spending so much money on what basically boils down to a choose your own adventure book. I didn't see a lot of reason to revisit any particular island after the first play, since not much would change. It also serms this is best solo or two player at most, which isn't my usual gaming preference.

A well crafted adaptation of choose-your-own-adventure exploration plus euro-ish resource management and survival.  On my initial play, the game was a delight -- surprises but no non-sequiturs, a reason to stop and look at the art and read the text carefully without devolving into Waldo.  Life is harsh and you have to trade-off survival, exploration, and quest progress.  Each curse is loosely guided with an ambiguous map or clue, which adds just enough information to give you a sense of where to spend your efforts without making it a chore to just follow the path and see what happens.  It feels scripted like a good story arc, not like a contrived leash; I know there is a solution and can look for it, but I also know there are emergent choices that matter.

The biggest issue is that it is not much fun to repeat an adventure if you fail (or if you succeed).  That sometimes feels fair when you make a bad judgment, sometimes feel harsh (but thematic) when you get unlucky, and sometimes feels frustrating when you didn't find the right clue to know how to proceed properly.  On one adventure I got the end but lost because I hadn't found something I needed along the way.  I needed to have gone off the primary route at just the right time to explore, but I saw no clue to that fact.  I did, in fact, go off the route by accident but not in the right place, and the game felt like it was punishing me for not staying on track with my quest.  That punishment felt fair, until I later realized that I had been punished for doing the right thing at the wrong time without sufficient cluing.

update:  reading spoilers, I found out that I had missed a subtle clue.  But I likely wouldn't have otherwise found it without flailing around on successive plays while repeating 80% of the content I'd seen.  That isn't a terrible experience, but it isn't the brilliance of a play on the first time through a mission.

The saving system is a rogue-like saving system that allow resumption later, but it does not allow back-peddling to avoid repeated content (that would be hard in a board game, but if possible it would address other issues).  As is, it's a nice feature, but it can damage your board position if you haven't already just cleared the board from a voyage -- I lost a game because I false thought I was done backtracking and so I saved.  When I resumed, I found myself in a dead end and died re-exploring content that should have been face up.  Save carefully!

Fear the Devourers, Facing the Elements, and Path of Repentance expansions add "fat" and over-complicate the otherwise simple gameplay. They are not only unnecessary to enjoy the game to its fullest potential but actually hinder the experience in significant ways. I wish I hadn't spent the extra money on them.

A few mechanisms add fluff that isn't fun, but monotonous instead. I think the designers did it to tout a larger number of potential playtime hours (i.e. "value"). Otherwise, it's a nifty "point-and-click" adventure that's been severely overhyped.

Note: it is really a solo or couple's game

I ordered this game at the tail end of the Kickstarter campaign. I ordered the base game and all expansions and all add-ons. I'm glad I did, because everything is made so well right down to the cartographer's notebook and the "bone" dice.

This won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I feel like this game was tailor-made for me: single-player friendly, emphasis on exploration/survival, a strong mystery element, puzzles, great production quality, and looooooooooong playing time. I really like a game you can "chew on" for a while, like Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective and the like. 

I'm so happy with the finished product! This is one of the best, if not the best, gaming experiences I've ever had. I'm pumped to see what else the creators come up with in the Sept 2017 KS campaign.

I think the resemblance is closer to point-and-click PC puzzle games than adventure game books, and the laborious “go-everywhere-press-everything” nature of those is present here, and something that doesn’t appeal to me much, though I have a lot of admiration for how well the transition from screen to decks of cards has been achieved. If I was deserted on a desert island with this, I imagine that once I had gotten over the irony I would find it an engrossing pastime.

Wow.  What an awesomely designed game.   I have played two sessions thus far totaling 12 hours.  While the game is completely immersive and challenging and fun, I can't help but think I could be playing all of my top ten games in the time I try to finish one curse.  I'm truly torn on this one.

RATING: 9.1
It's difficult to say "i would suggest this game" because, with a play time of 10-20+ hours, who's honestly going to say "yes" to that suggestion? Nonetheless, this is a unique, engrossing, and intense game with surprisingly approachable rules, and i expect we'll start to see other games adopt some of the mechanics "real soon now". The idea of a adapting this choose-your-own-path style of game to a Living Card Game ((TM) of FFG, by the way) format (and sales model) doesn't seem far-fetched.

The game's "weight" rating seems to be a point of contention. The rules are actually remarkably light, but the interaction of cards, and their sheer number, begs for the weight to be adjusted upwards. i've got to rate it a solid "Medium", all things considered. Despite the number of moving parts, this game does not feel "fiddly" nor (IMO) brain-burny. However, you have to go into the game recognizing that it may take "arbitrarily long" (many people are reporting 15-30 hours for their first session, due to the scope of the adventure, not the complexity of the rules).

i can't really imagine playing this with multiple players, but as a solo-play game it's one of my two favorites ever.

It's also the only modern tabletop game i own which prints the manual on non-glossy paper, which has made me realize what a plague on the world glossy paper is.

PS: those rating it a 4 or less "because it costs too much" haven't bothered to calculate the production and shipping cost of 1400 cards, and such rants can be ignored out of hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great game with a good replay value even if you already explored a certain part of the island. I love how all cards make sense together and the mechanic of deck-managing is also very good.

I would say that the only "drawback" is that you'll need a lot of time with the same team to get to the end of a scenario. (Yes, I know a player can enter or leave the game but I don't know a sensible player who wouldn't play this game till the end ;) )

Thematic / 1 - 2 Players / Fantasy / Adventure, Storytelling / 2.9 / Dec 2017

This is an amazing adventure but it does get quite stale after a while, especially as I have just invested 3 hrs so far in solo mode and I think I have barely completed 20% (at most) of this the first curse.

This is an unfair comparison, but if I wanted an epic solo adventure experience, I think Video Games are a much superior medium to express the grandiose setting and thrill of the unknown. Skyrim and Witcher 3 stand out as unforgettable storytelling and adventure RPG masterpieces, offering excitement and "immersiveness" that unfortunately 7th Continent was unable to convey.

Very early first impressions: 

Reminiscent of TIME Stories or Unlock in its use of numbered cards to hide information, but with more of an RPG adventure feel. The game consists of a very large number of numbered cards, mostly representing locations on a map, each of which will have actions to complete or things to investigate. Success and failure in these actions reveals cards telling you how your failure to climb down the cliff has led to you falling to your death, your success has revealed a new area or given you an item etc.

What makes it a Fighting Fantasy game rather than a Choose Your Own Adventure novel is the overall deck-management metagame. Completing actions requires drawing cards from the deck, or (when the deck is exhausted) the discard pile; drawing a curse from the discard pile ends the game. It's possible to replenish the deck by hunting, which takes items, actions, relevant locations and relevant equipment.  There are a large number of item cards making various actions easier or cheaper, but these require actions to craft and space in your inventory and so are not no-brainer pickups.

Initial impressions are that it's a fantastic idea and very well realized, with some caveats. It's very fiddly: the constant card lookups remind me a little of the ungainly paper-based AI in Ambush!. This would be less of a problem were it not for the traditional gamebook problem of needing to start again at the beginning after making a fatal mistake. This is also an issue in TIME Stories, but subsequent playthroughs of TIME Stories scenarios are much faster than they are in 7th Continent.

Great game - I think this is what I was looking for with Mage Knight, Pathfinder Card Game and Robinson Crusoe. Somehow it combines elements of all of these to make a really good game that's a lot easier to learn than all of those with a deep narrative. Possible negatives are the limited replayability and that ultimately the game is about finding an optimal path through each scenario, and once that's done, the game is used up. My worry also is that the joy of the game is to wander, but often it feels like the pressure to move on and be efficient detracts from the desire to want to fully explore.

RATING: 7
I backed the first kickstarter.  Soon after receiving it a second kickstarter started with additional curses/content.  I played the game 8 times to decide if I wanted to continue to invest in the system.

I really liked the theme, the exploration, the art, and how to use the action deck for item creation.

I was turned off by the idea of being able to play for 10 hours and having to restart if I died.  I have a lot of games that I enjoy and I would not  restart...didn't like this game mechanic in T.I.M.E Stories but that game is shorter.

The newest kickstarter has an alternative to the instant death/restart thing but when I played on easy (game comes with a card that lets you reset your action deck) instead of dying it lacked the tension that was there with the threat of death.

Ultimately, I have decided to sell the game.  My favorite games (Descent, LotR, Legendary, Sentinels) all have shorter scenarios.  When my daughter and I beat a scenario or defeat a tough bad guy she will exclaim, "Boo-Yah-Kashaw"!  I have no idea what it means but it is kind of her touchdown celebration.  When I play The 7th Continent I don't have any Boo-Yah-Kawshaw moments...sure exploring new things are cool, but if I play for an hour or two and I don't have any big moments it makes me feel like the payoff isn't big enough for the time I spent.  I just ended up feeling frustrated with how long it was taking to complete the course.  

I started to try to convince myself that I liked the game, but once I am at that point it is time to move on.  I have a lot of games that I don't have to try to enjoy.

I am also learning that I am just not a fan of puzzle games.  I got lost and ended up retreating and covering a lot of the same ground.

The other thing that convienced me to sell it is that if I had the opportunity to play the game in the first place I would not have backed it.

Bummer...the experience of getting off of the first island was awesome but the fun didn't last for me.  

I wish all of the other explorers the best.  The game is incredibly ambitious and is well executed...it just isn't for me.

I also received Aeon's End around the same time.  The game fits my style much better.  In less than an hour I will win (Boo-Yah-Kashaw!) or I will lose and be ready to go again.

RATING: 8
Super cool system, great usage of cards.  A touch fiddly in terms of finding cards and placing them but very small hindrance in the overall scheme of things.  One negative I felt was that we played for 3+ hours and felt like we only accomplished a very minimal amount of the story-line. It's a bit tough to play a full session and have to save a game.  I feel like I would be much more apt to do this if I was playing solo or with someone I was constantly around.  Getting together a group is much harder to than just sit down and get it done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Does a clever job of converting a computer old-style text/graphics adventure game to board game form. But...was that something that was really worth doing?
 Interesting...but long, cumbersome despite essentially simple rules. Feels more like a solitaire game than a co-op. Most decisions are either "trial and error" or random. We played through the first curse, but not sure it interested us enough to play more.

Haven't touched it all, halfway the first curse.

The start feels a little scripted, and I wonder about the replay value but it is a bit early to judge on that.

Playing the game, I feel immersed and excited. Exactly the thrill I hoped this game would bring. Figuring out what to do, always wondering what will be at that path you haven't explored yet and in the meantime putting your brain to work in order you don't perish.. or at least not too soon as you will encounter the unexpected at times you really can't have it, until you've figured out the flow of the game.

Wonder how fresh it will stay, and wonder about replay value but for now, it delivers. And that is far more than most kickstarter games do, so I'm pleasantly surprised. Rating is still preliminary until more playtime is in.

One caveat: I would have liked a multiple save structure, as right now you either need a very dedicated coop group or play this as a solo game. As I find myself wanting to play it more but at the same time not wanting to spoil the fun of jointly exploring the continent further with the one 2p save I have. Ah well.. it is a good sign to long for this game with so many other games to choose from.

[EDIT OCT 2017] The first flaw shows: had to break up the 2p save game with a friend as it simpy takes too long to plan for a follow-up session. And I don't want to wait on that, I want to play NOW :)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a great exploration game with an important survival twist, i.e. you need to properly manage your Action deck.

The continent is beautifully illustrated, and there is some kind of "Myst" experience going on: you try to unravel the mysteries of the curse you are under.

Be prepared to repeat several of your quests in order to "solve" them (i.e. like a TIME Stories reset). However, maybe it is better if you fail at one curse to try another one next. It will not only be a fresh experience, but you may get hints along the way about the other curse as well...

Since items/states/locations/actions etc are all cards sorted in the box, getting the right ones makes for a *very* fiddly experience. I did not plan to sleeve the cards at all, but after a few plays I will definitely do just that. The corners get minor damage very quickly.

If kickstarter was meant for games at all, then it is this type of game for sure. The amount of detail and story telling on all these cards is breathtaking. So it is no wonder the project took a long time to complete.

Add to that the amount of attention to production detail (including the magnifying glass, the discard pile holder, the minis AND standees, etc) and you get a top class product. Glad to have such a unique gem in my game collection!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
7th continent feels like a Choose Your Own Adventure Book, plus a ton of card sorting to slow things down and make it less fun than that kind of solo experience. Ultimately, the playing is largely that of resource management and card sorting, and while the mystery/fog element is neat, the inconsistent art isn't appealing to me--some illustrations are roughly drawn while others resemble 90s computer models. The play style of "go everywhere, do everything, and the clues will eventually be found" also seems laborious rather than adventurous. And having the positive and negative outcomes shown on the cards before a decision is made really spoils the narrative bit by bit. 
This gameplay is somehow both too linear and too open in that it requires specific things to be done in a massive system.  The adventuring feels set up for right and wrong paths to achieve certain goals rather than a truly open story that I can live out with my character.
It's as if somebody is whispering "Keep to the script" when I wanna explore. Perdition's Mouth doesn't do this.  Mage Knight doesn't do this. Even oldies like Barbarian Prince and rogue like Citadel of Blood don't do this.
It's a respectable and admirable achievement, but the play felt tedious very early on each time I played.

Great idea and good fun for about two playthroughs.
The game is rather repetitive and it is boring as hell, if you restart the game with a new Curse (or after you died) and have to do everything all over again - the changes in the world between the curses are minimal. 
So it is a game I can totaly recommend to play one or two curses - after that the game is basicaly burned out. But at that point you will have spent quite a few hours with this game, so it surely is not wasted money. But you won't need any expansions at all.

Explore the continent. A very nice game where you battle time against survival.

This game is my nr one game of all time. And my first kickstarter experience. Why I like this game you wonder?! It's exploration, push your luck, adventure, crafting, narrative storytelling wonderfull piece of art. Everything I wish a boardgame should have. And here you have it, the 7th Continent. And then there is the art, just wow! Every single card is beautifull and the components are solid! I just love playing this game. When I received the game I just looked at the box of the core game and the expansions for 10 minutes, before I opened it. It is so thematic! 

It reminds me of the fighting fantasy books, I still love to read! I hope and just hope the guys from SP keep supporting this game. Because once you've completed the curse. The experience of playing it again wont be so immersive as the first time you explored. But this goes the same for all story telling games. Like time stories or the excape rooms. There is still some variability because of the fog cards but still, you know what to do to get rid of the curse. 
I hope like with time stories (also a game I own, and all expansions) SP keeps supporting this wonderfull and beautiful game with new stuff for years to come.

You can tell that this game is not just something created to make money. But a dream of two kids that after years and years finally has been brought to life! This game will stay in my collection!

Tentative rating. Feel no progress after 6 hours play. Need to start again. Can’t say I’m not enjoying, often awed by so original implementation. Original, nothing like this. Probably because of that, it seems asking different approach. Maybe not a board game but a long time puzzle, pretty long I think.

Have only played solo, so far. I'm dubious of the replayability of a given scenario (curse). Am I meant to remember what parts of the continent to avoid the next time? Is that the only way to get through enough to explore uncharted areas? Because I will definitely remember most of the areas I explored in my first game. And I'm concerned that knowledge will effect the gameplay if I were to play the same curse with a friend.

The most unique game I have played. 

Six hours in and I am having the most fun I have had with a boardgame... ever. It is also the only game I have played where the actual game is as good as (my) hyped kickstarter expectations... usually, even the great ks games, do not feel as great as I had at some point imagined them to be.

I love this game. But it's not a fast one, For only one curse it's more than 24 hours of playing. The continent is very large. A fabulous game in solo mode, best with 4 players.

Surviving, exploring are the main themes. I recommand you to make your own map for another attempt.

First impressions: A well made adventure game with suitable amount of meaningful decisions. Had a lot of fun but need to play more before a verdict. Currently leaning toward a 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Outstanding game/experience; full of adventures and exploration, dripping with theme and backstory, and the mechanics are a model of stremlining while offering a ton of meeaningful decisions. I love it. 
Still, it has a couple negatives that keep it from being a 10. I would say it is a 10/10 as a SOLO game, and the fisrt time you play through a curse.
first negative, the game suffers a bit in terms of replayability; some  curse are trivial once you know what to do; I honnestly expected the continent to be bigger.
secondly, the game is fiddly; searching for multtiple cards can take you out of it, and replacing cards when saving or when putting the game away is a chore!

still there is a ton of challenge in the box: 7 varried characters to choose from, 7 curses (each ranging from 20h at first to 10h once you know what you're doing), the HARD mode makes every little action more costly and the whole thing much harder; the "history of the continent" is like an 8th curse; finding all trophies in the hunt is so much fun; playing with all 7 curses at the same time is a blast (but so hard)!

[+] theme is awsome and very present, artwork & components are very good, setup is fast, streamlined mechanics offering so many choices and very few rules questions, it is "hand & inventory micro-management" in a box, many many hours that you won't see passing
[-] box is huge, very fiddly teardown (10-15 minutes of sorting cards), multiplayer takes even more time and can be even fiddlier, replayability of some curses, better experienced in long sessions

rating the curses separately:
goddess: 8 [+] both a good tutorial and a good adventure [-] a bit criptic for the second gem
hunt: 10 [+] scalable and replayable, ties in with other curses to achieve 100% [-] ...
gardians: 7 [+] simple but [-] repetitive
chest: 9 the first time, 5 after that [+] layered story but [-] the least replayable
maze: 8 [+] new kind of exploration but [-] more randomness and in its own bubble
swamp: 8 [+] fast succession of hard trials [-] felt very short
sanctuary: 9 [+] excellent mix of exploration and puzzles [-] ...
history of the continent: 8 [+] got me spending more time on a side quest than on any curses ;) [-] got me ;)

obviously there is a huge potential for add-ons, expansions, re-theming...
as a side note,  I could totally see that system implemented as a mobile app; it would remove all fiddlyness, could be upgradded for replayability, but of course noone would pay 100€/$ for that.

got from Kickstarter without add-ons
got promo cards from BGG
backed 2nd KS to get expansions and maybe 1st add-ons

This is not a game, this is a labour of love. Each little thing in this game is just a marvelous shout-out to its inspirations (which are mainly gamebooks). Is it a perfect game?

Really wanted to like this one but was very disappointed by the PNP demo.   Hopefully the issues in that have been resolved in the full game, but it was enough to kill most of my interest in the game and made me glad to not have backed the Kickstarter campaign.

If the game crosses my path sometime in the future I'd definitely still be willing to play it, but it's off my wishlist and will not be actively sought out.

As I've gotten the rules straightened out during this, my first ongoing play (1-player), I am liking this more and more. There are numerous clever, smart, and ingenious design choices that you can't appreciate until they pop up in the game. Also, being allowed to combine inventory items lets you imagine some very funny fusions of different items. Use your bow as a walking stick? Sure! Use your camouflage outfit as bolas? As soon as I pictured violent pasties (not the Cornish meal-in-a-pastry; the other things one uses in pairs), I was quite amused.

No matter how much you're into the story, the choices are good and tough. You get to feel like you cleverly game the system, while it [generally] righteously abuses you right back. …but it doesn't [generally] feel unfair! Yet. :ninja:

Rating based on a demogame at Essen. I was excited to see and play the game and was lucky enough to playtest the game with an engaged and fun group. Surprisingly, however, the game did´t grip me (or us for that matter) at all. Even after an hour of playtime there was no real tension or storyline and it felt more like grinding the map. Maybe there is much more down the road - but it left me quite cold so far.

Unreal... sooooo much story, creativity, depth and replayability.

This game has taken over my every waking thought since I played it the first time.  All I want to do is play this game, take one more turn, see one more terrain tile or go back and try this or that option I neglected the first time through.

There is nothing like this game on the market.  If you ever played text based computer RPG style games, or even Zelda on NES, you'll love this game.  The cleverness of this game is astounding.

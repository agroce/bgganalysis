Beautiful work and a wonderful game.  I can't believe that this is a free print and play game and it just begs for commercial production.  The reconrd keeping is intuitive and although the rules may seem weighty at first blush, 5-10 minutes of learn-as-you-go play is all that is really needed to get rolling.

So.  Notes.  step one - loved Island of D (D2).

This follow-up both succeeds and fails.
It adds a fair bit of variability, and expands upon the game systems drastically.  Cards now serve about 5-6 purposes instead of 3-4.  This all works well.

Unfortunately, I feel that the game itself suffers from being too long and too easy.

The brilliance of Island of D (and this game as well) is that even with a completely optimal gameplay, your endgame fight is going to be a 50% chance at victory.  So victories are both earned and lucky at the same time.  Without optimal play, you'll find the end fight impossible.

So most of the gameplay is in the setup for the final fight.  Can you get the items you need quickly enough (D2)?

Dungeon of D removes the time pressure, and in doing so, removes most of the challenge from the early and mid-game.  Movement doesn't drain your resources like it does in D2 - so you are best served by wandering around levels to 'level up'.

After 8 levels of wandering, attempting to level up all your stats to maximum, the game begins to drag.

So the final confrontation, which remains difficult (optimal case chance of success 65%) takes too long to reach.

Like any game of difficult solitaire, the urge to replay immediately should be high, and due to game length, one game is usually enough of Dungeon of D.


Other thoughts.
There are also some other bits that I'm not sure if they belong in this game system.  Notably, you can alter the composition of the deck (your random number generator) by choosing to keep items that have low ## values.  Should this be part of the game?  At least the best items are paired with the highest numbers - but if keeping an item that gives you a plus one removes one of the 5 cards from the deck.....

Very nice looking solo dungeon crawler. Card-based.

RATING: 7
Very good solo dungeon crawl.  Need a lot of luck to survive long enough to build up your character to be strong enough to pass all the tests on the final level of the dungeon and escape, but it's a fun journey!  I finally won after at least a dozen attempts: 6220 was my final score.  
The system is very well designed.  There is constant tension between wandering around to kill things to get the money to improve your stats vs. moving on to the next level.  Moving costs you hit points if you run out of move cards, which can be devastating if you move too far from a room in which you can rest effectively.  You basically only get one rest per level of the dungeon, so if you don't draw some of the rooms that let you buy healing it can get very difficult.  It a fun dynamic that some of the better items and potions are on the high numbered cards - if you keep them you take those numbers out of the deck which makes subsequent checks more difficult.
It's not the kind of game I will play a lot, but I appreciate the cleverness of the design.  Well done!

Published online.  Interesting solitaire game that features a multi-use card mechanic.  Extreme resource management required.  Hardest part is making the cards.  Requires patience and a hefty amount of time.

RATING: 9
This is an extremely clever and well designed solitaire game. There are some well thought out mechanisms that balance the advantages and disadvantages of playing each card. The cards are multi purpose, a feature that always makes for interesting decisions. I've played 4 times now and only got as far as level 5! I can't understand how some on BGG have gained the amulet in a couple of games? The difficulty and frustration of failing are  good features as far as I'm concerned.

Fun game to play solo when you have a half our to 45 minutes to spare.  I am still a little unsure on the timing and some more obscure rules but overall the rule book and cards are designed great.  I had the cards printed out and shipped to me from Printer Studio and they look and feel just as good as cards from any FF board game. I spent $14 and had a free shipping coupon.

If you like dungeon crawls and looking for a challenge, this game fills that niche easily.

Yes, it's a free game but sadly, less compelling than IoD2. It's a bit repetitive to have to go through 8 levels of samey-samey dungeons. Frankly, I was bored by the 4th level. But the main problem is that, again, the system is too sensitive to card draw. You can't afford to waste cards because Rest is so hard to come by (there's not enough opportunities to get Fruits in the game!) That means you can't afford to lose battles, which is ridiculous. I think it would help to make Fruits more available in the game.

Bought from Artscow because I thought it would be as much fun as Island of D 2. Sad to say, it isn't. Not sure why since it's based on the same system. Maybe it's because it has less "questing" feel and more "hack & slash" feel which I like less. Maybe more plays will tell.

RATING: 6.5
This was simple to make, and the artwork is great for a P&P game.
The gameplay is a lot of fun, although it's obviously dependent on luck. My first play I was crushed on the third level. My second play I went all the way down and got the amulet for the win.
After two plays I am anxious to play again. Also, I haven't seen the majority of the character abilities. And I haven't touched more than half of the special items. So there should be a good amount of replay in here.
This is better than Dungeoneer. And it's free :)

Printed and ready to play - haven't tried yet (April 2009).  Looks great.
UPDATE:  After two plays, this is totally a winner with me.  I do a lot of solo gaming to "chill out" and this one is going to get worn out big time.  Very replayable considering the deck isn't huge.  Just a clever, clever system.
UPDATE #2: After 6 plays now, I stil want to keep playing!  I haven't won yet, but have come very close.  The game keeps surprising me with clever design elements (the better permanent items are printed on the best off-skill value cards - evil deck thinning).  One of my top 3 solo games, with Runebound and Arkham Horror.  Can't say enough good about this game.  Rating raised to "9".

This was the first "print-and-play" game I ever put together...  I did a horrible job and am thinking about remaking it as it is a really good game.

It's a very "roguelike" card game with an interesting "power card" system.  The game can be very harsh at times with luck seeming to be stacked against you, but there are ways in the game allowing you to try and mitigate the risk.  This can make for a lot of tough decisions...

An amazing print and play game for sure, this is absolutely astonishing work cramming so much great gameplay into 94 cards. The core mechanics are really clever, simple and yet rich - as a player who always favors cards over dice this is a winner for me, and apart from that there is just enough flavor here to make it a great game overall. While ultimately 18 rooms is not that much it is worth noting that the overall variety is really great and while ultimately retreading the same grounds, there is always a slightly different "story" to the game if you're willing to stretch your imagination a little, and the order the rooms come in does change the whole experience quite considerably. So do all the characters, items and stuff like that, making it a highly replayable game in my opinion - especially since the difficulty seems to be solidly balanced - I did make it from the dungeon at level 8 once, but already a few games in I'm still trying to actually escape with the amulet, which seems to be a difficult feat to accomplish.

Great solo dungeon crawler. I think the key to making the mechanics good is that EVERYTHING is on cards. So, the clever player can stack the deck by, for instance, holding on to potions/items that have low numbers, thus keeping higher numbers in the power deck. Needs more room card expansions!

This game has some real aspects of genius. The power cards are a fantastic mechanic, and they really make it a tight game, where you need to think carefully about each move.

Let me start off by saying this is my 1st PnP game.  I love the idea of card and board games but never really get to play them all that often.  I bumped into a description of DoD one late night and was really intrigued by the idea of a solitaire Dungeon crawler that only required cards. I followed Google to BGG (1st time I've been here as well) and saw all the rave reviews. I figured oh why not. Spent a half an hour setting up an artscow order and clicked buy. I am utterly impressed.  The mechanics involved in the game's design are both simple and brilliant.  Truly artful game design.  The power card system is a masterpiece, makes me wish I was clever enough to concoct such a design.  Being this is my first PnP it sets a really high standard.  I received my order on a Friday and I played through the entire weekend, all the while muttering how genius the game's mechanics were.  Great game, well worth a print.

Many designers have tried to offer a genuinely enjoyable solo play experience. Most don't succeed, and even those that do usually only get as far as 'not bad'. Dungeon of D is a solo-only dungeon crawl using nothing but cards (plus something to mark your position with, such as a counter or coin). The cards which are used for many different purposes, in a way which works surprisingly well. While it's never going to be as enjoyable as a full scale multiplayer game, it's easily one of the best solo tabletop experiences. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
UPDATE: Bumping up my rating to 9. The games is pure rogue-genius!
Getting the amulet is to a really high degree a matter of luck (like ending NetHack) but you "win" the game by just surviving, so you have an intermediate goal (beating your high score) and a long term one for your lucky plays (getting the amulet).
The game is full of tense decisions:
- Should you heal now or risk a movement with low health?
- Do you try a small test or save the cards/HP?
- Run away? Try for a ranged attack?
- Do you go deeper or do I leave the dungeon?
That is, if you find the exit... :D

***********************************************
Great "little" solitaire game.(if you play well it can go for a couple of hours!). Very clever use of the cards and a lot of replayability (mostly because of the ton of characters you can use).
It has a great Rogue feeling! 
If you like Rogue games, this one is for you.

13-10-08: Printed this out and card sleeved everything using 2 decks of normal cards I had lying around at home. A very well thought out card game that squeezes a lot of mechanics into two simple decks! After 2 plays, I'm beginning to realise that you'll usually end up escaping the Dungeon without the Amulet (to score points), and only luck will see if you make it to the final room with the Ice Dragon. Thumbs up for great game play in a free game! I only wish that the games were shorter; the last games I played went well over an hour.

The theme is terrific for such a small variety of cards.
A lot of creativity here.
It's easy to learn and packs as well or better than any other game I own. I have it all in a single Ultra Pro deck box with room to spare.
I never concern myself with card backs when it comes to print and play games, and instead just sleeve everything. But what sleeving enables me to do is create my own rooms - which I shall!  Once I have Jack's permission I will add them to the files section.
Good about the game: Depth of game for such a small package.
Not good about the game: Could use some more content.

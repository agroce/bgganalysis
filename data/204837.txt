Uma boa versão do Cosmic Encounter, com ótimo nível de interação entre os jogadores. Jogo de mecânicas clássicas, mas não datado. caça níquel por conta do seriado, mas vale a pena ter na coleção

RATING: 7
It is a cosmic encounter reimplementation imagined in the Game of Thrones Series. It really is a good game, and the theme fits very well in this design, but it is impossible not to compare with the predecessor game.

Cosmic Encounter overall is a better game, with more variety (specially with expansions, but just the base game is a lot more variable than The Iron Throne), but The Iron Throne have a best control over the cards you get, since every player have his own deck of cards.

The game implements some new interesting mechanics that are a lot powerful, like hostages, in spite of being a really harmful mechanism.

This game have potential but I think it would get better with more expansions.

Re-themed cosmic encounter. I really liked the way allies can play event cards. That's a big improvement on cosmic. I also like the curated selection of powers/aliens--there's too many in my copy of CE, and I pruned my deck. Let's be honest, 50 unique powers is plenty. 20 is probably plenty. The hundreds of aliens in CE bloat the game and dilute the experience.

It's the classic Cosmic Encounter system (which I played long ago and wasn't entirely to my taste) re-skinned with the strong hook of Game of Thrones (also not something I'm fanatical about), but a popular and enduring system that was missing from my collection teamed up with a popular and (so far) enduring theme at a sale price ($34) seemed too good to pass up.
I know from owning [thing=103343][/thing] that Game of Thrones is a theme that can interest people in playing a game they might not otherwise, but the boardgame is very long, complicated and doesn't have images from the TV show (it was licensed from the books and has drawings of the characters). This game addresses all those issues (it seems like it might fix some of the misgivings I had about the original Cosmic Encounter as well).

The mid game is great, the end game - especially the kingmaking in the last rounds - ruins it for me. This, and the fact that there can be multiple players sitting on the Iron Throne makes me regret getting it.

czech version from blackfire.i was missing a targaryen influence token and there promtly reacted and will send me one.kudos to them.back to the game.
pros
cheap for a HBO licence. good cutthroat game with very good tide to the tv series.every character has abilities that are thematic to the IP.
components good.rulebook ok.easy to get to and quick play even at 5 players.
negatives.
the design feels quite dated to be honest thou.
very little to bargain with.power,influence or hostages mostly thats not too much.
i cannot imagine to play cosmic encouter and pay for it 50 euros + 23 for each expansion.simply not enough game for me at this price point.i would rather buy blood rage.
and i dont know why they says 3 people it must be so stupid to play wih 3.4 minimum and at 5 the fun begins.now i understand why the expansion is so high up.but i need wait for the czech version and i will.

this is at least cheap and got good license with better IP that suits the style better.its has better tactical play than a over the top insane power abilities in CE which makes the game a total craze.you want some grip in a boardgame.
a must for game of thrones TV fans

Decent fun, maybe just a tad repetitive. It seems like the game should always be close, since folks aren't going to support an attack that's going to win the game for the attacker, unless maybe it'll get them a tie for the win.

I can tell that knowing the game well could improve the fun, since folks will immediately understand the potential card abilities of the characters participating in the encounter. The game badly needs a rule reference though.

RATING: 6
While it presents a more cogent theme than Cosmic Encounter, it also feels more tame and less interesting. The card play doesn't feel as wild (I miss flares, especially), and the setup of using heroes and your leader also feels unnecessarily complicated. Separating influence from power is also probably a step too far and makes the game more complex without more depth. 

I would play it again, as it has some of the same DNA as Cosmic, but I would never choose this over CE and I'd never own this.

It's GoT-themed Cosmic Encounter, with a few tweaks, including separate characters and card decks for each player. The theming is nicely done, although the hostage mechanic might be more complicated than it's worth. The separate decks add variety, but of course it's not the same as the original's myriad expansions offer.

If you like both properties, and don't already own Cosmic, you'll want to look into this. If you already own Cosmic, this game's value might depend on whether you have friends who would be more interested in playing this version.

Personally, I'm not a huge Cosmic guy, but it's good for a few chuckles.

RATING: 1
Boring. An unbalanced chaotic mess, with unclear and incomplete rules. A product placement TV show pasted onto a 1/2 baked game. To be fair, I'm not a fan of games where any strategic, or in this case, even tactical results pivot entirely on the often unpredictable actions of other players and the best laid plans get blown away. In other words, no planning, just jump into every battle you can, flip a coin and pick a side. That's the game. The special character cards for some factions border on being useless and are often unplayable, where as others seem to offer up some hope of reducing the luck factor (for the owner of that faction).  The first game took 1.5 hrs, but felt like 2.5 and the second game, took about 1 hour, that also seemed like 2.5 hrs. Cosmic Encounter is a classic game, it's theme and  campy originality over rides it's flaws, and I can accept the randomness, and the underlying game system because there was enough variety to make it interesting-not with this.  It's clearly a crass attempt to make a crap base game and then flog expansions to fix the mistakes, and for the unfortunate ones....extend the pain. If I want to play a game based on a TV show I'll stick with Partridge Family, more exciting...Danny > Joffre any day!

The Iron Throne is a new implementation of the Cosmic Encounter game system with the Game of Thrones theme. Game of Thrones is the perfect theme when you consider mechanisms involved in Cosmic Encounter. There are some marked differences between Iron Throne and Cosmic Encounter. They are:

a) Player's don't draw from a communal deck of cards. Each player has their own deck of attack and negotiate cards. The player's deck also includes character cards. Consider these similar to Flares except when you use them, they don't go back to your hand.

b) Instead of 5 planets, each player has 4 characters. When you attack or defend in Iron Throne, you choose which character you are attacking or defending with. The character you choose to attack/defend/ally with, will dictate what character cards you can use. 

c) In Cosmic, you have planets and ships are trying to go on other's planets to win the game. In Iron Throne, you are trying to spread 5 influence to other player's houses. These are separate from the characters and power on those characters (which are similar to planets/ships in Cosmic).

d) In Iron Throne, you can kill characters. If every character in a player's house has been killed, this acts as an alternative end game condition. Dead characters can't use their related character cards for special abilities.

e) In the Iron Throne, you can take hostages from an opponent. These are either a random card from their deck or hand or one of their hostages. This seem to result in the death of characters more than the negotiation of exchanges.

I like this more than Cosmic Encounter. This is mainly because it feels less chaotic. I feel this way because each player's deck is identical in composition. Well, the characters in the deck are different, but each deck has the same number of character cards per character. So, things don't go crazy with random flares, reinforcements, artifacts, and rewards. The character system also makes the game less random. I say this because each player has a leader and character involved in an encounter and only character cards of the involved leader and character may be played. So, when you have an encounter, you will know all the range of cards and special abilities (2 per person involved) that can happen. As you play them game more, you'll recall what special abilities a particular house has as well.

At first, I didn't think I would like The Iron Throne because I thought it would be very chaotic with many rules ambiguities due to all of the powers, as in Cosmic Encounter. I was also sad they used screen captures from the show, over artwork used in the LCG/new artwork. In the end, I enjoyed this more than I thought. The changes from Cosmic make it a better (and quicker) game in my opinion. The rulebook isn't the best, but with a good player aid/teacher who knows the rules, there aren't many rules ambiguities. The screen captures turned out better than I had originally thought. There is even an expansion that will add 2 new houses, the ability to play up to 7, and ally cards. Definitely worth a look if you liked the idea of Cosmic, but it didn't quite work for you. If you love Cosmic, you may not like this as much, but it's still worth a try.

Extremely boring game that falls into the category of the 80% of games made themed on a movie, video game, book or series.

Don't buy this. It's really not worth anything and especially not at the price they are charging. It should be a 20$ game at most.

The gameplay makes you go asleep quickly. Very little is happening in this game. It is like they wanted to make a card game, but only two players can play one and only one card. The goal is to get rid of your tokens, yay!

Fantasy Blight is really a poor game designer. All they do is eyecandy.

not much play, but the little I had was underwhelming.  a lot of chaos, and then someone wins, mostly based on whining/complaining/someone not understanding the possible outcomes of the cards.

Our first game drug on at the end.  The player in the lead could not ever spread his final influence due to the rest of us ganging up.  Finally the other 3 of us were able to  end the game by ganging up on him on an attack and sharing a 3 way victory.  We just needed to end the game at that point.  I think we were all a little disappointed by the ending (once my brother got within 1 influence of winning) but up to that point was fun. Not sure how often this one will hit the table.

Ez engem meglepett. Nem igazán vagyok oda a "győzzük meg egymást" játékokért, de ez valami miatt érdekes, élvezetes, szórakoztató volt. Abszolút érezni, hogy vannak mélységei, és van mit felfedezni benne. Egyértelműen az a játéktípus, aminél extrém fontos, hogy kikkel játszik az ember, az a játék lelke, a szabályok csak egy olyan keretet adnak, amiben a kommunikáción van a hangsúly.

RATING: 7
FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a variation of Cosmic Encounter but is its own game. The crowns (space ships) are a limited resource and you will never be able to add more to the game - you can only steal them from other people. Once lost, crowns are permanently removed from that game. Character cards in the decks provide a bit of flavor and special abilities as does the ruling member of the family. Games can end in several ways, not just people winning by reaching 5 influence. The hostage mechanic is well implemented and interesting. I'd recommend looking through your decks and knowing the abilities of your characters before playing the game.

As a long time Cosmic Encounter fan, I find this one to be an improved version of Cosmic.  While it doesn't have as many powers as base CE, it does have powers that feel strong and useful to the player.  There is also far more diplomacy and strategy involved.

However, this is a game where you do need the players to talk to one another.  If the players just simply go through the turns without talking to anyone (or at least being too honest), it can fall apart quite easily.  This is a game where bluffing about your intentions is a very important part of this game.  If your group isn't like that, avoid this one.

Another important factor is Encounters in GoT are far more involving than in Cosmic Encounter.  Because each character sent to an encounter has their own power, there are more factors to worry about when you are engaging with another player.  Because of this, some players might find it a bit overwhelming.  As someone who grew up with Cosmic Encounter and Magic: The Gathering, I'm fine with all these effects, but other players might not.

Cosmic Encounter remade for a Westeros setting? Uaagh. Sounds like a "20 expensive expansions required to make it equally as variable as the original" licence.

I love GoT and the fact they have the actual pictures of the characters, I very much enjoy. It might not be that way for many people and those who don't know the show will probably not enjoy it as I enjoy it. I can't say I was a fan of Cosmic Encounter but for some reason this game is just SO MUCH FUN. I can't wait to play it again with different characters and encounters. the table talk in this game is just the best. You have to play with GoT fans though.

With limited play experience, this game did not grab me. It seems abstract and prone to interpersonal dynamics between the players to drive the action. I am not adverse to cutthroat games, but this one seemed overly adversarial. Strategy seems to be so very dependent on other players support and betrayal choices that planning is almost irrelevant… draw good cards and hope others don't stab you in the back. (First reviewed: Feb. 23, 2017) Update: Won a 5-player game with a "chaos strategy" of attacking, betraying and supporting on a whim. Seems to confirm my initial thoughts on the game. The best part of the game is the belligerent table talk, but I stand by the rating. I should note that I am unfamiliar with the TV program.

Played a few times and overall enjoyed it. Rule book a bit insufficient, but there are good play aids out there. Spreading only 5 influence markers seem like it happens a little too fast, especially with fewer players. Have now played a 5-player game with the expansion. Definitely a go-to multiplayer game with relatively low rules overhead (despite a clear lack of precision here and there).

A great game with lots of interaction and bluffing.  If you like Sheriff of Nottingham, but want a little more depth, this may be a game for you.  If you are a Thrones fan--then this is  a no-brain-buy;and  though there is room for both games on the shelf,  I sold my copy of Cosmic Encounter and bought the WARS TO COME expansion just for the extra factions. This game will see more table    time due to  its theme and the streamlined rules set--and it doesn't wear out its  welcome, playing in about an hour or so. Feels great at four players--looking forward to five or more soon. . .

I don't know.... I wnat to try this some more, but it seems like a much dryer version of Cosmic Encounter. Yes, it's so close, that comparisons are mandatory -- which may have been a mistake, I think, and I'm not sure GoT really fits here -- it sort of feels like a lazy attempt at capitalizing on the GoT license with the engine of an already successful game, and that's probably exactly what this is.

However, comparisons to Cosmic Encounter and philosophical questions aside, I think this still has potential to create some very fun games. Need to see more of the powers.

[thing=204837][/thing] uses many of the mechanisms found in [thing=39463][/thing], changing the setting from cosmic to Westeros and including some other differences, mainly to give more thematic flavor and enhance control, as you won't find the crazy (and fun) powers of the aliens, nor cards like the Zap, Flares and such.

However, the changes didn't really accomplished its goal: there is still a lot of luck in the draw (maybe even more), in spite of the numbers going from 0 to 20, instead of 0 to 40. This is due to the character cards, which are, in one hand, a neat addition, since it makes the "planets" into persons, and to get the use of a particular character card, the player must send that individual to the encounter, and this, sometimes, means sending a weaker person, which can raise suspicions and create some tense moments. Yet, on the other hand, these cards are awful to be your main defense or attack, just giving a value of 0 - they are a good complement, but aren't, usually, meant to carry the bulk of the encounter. Thus, a hand filled with character cards can be an awful thing, and hard to recover, since cards are only drawn at the turn of the own player or when helping in a successful defense. And this gets tougher to deal when you already lost one or two family members.

[thing=204837][/thing] even makes easier to keep facing the same weakened opponent, as the once the player reveals a card of her own family, she can choose what family to face, which may sound good on paper, but in play is just more blood in the water and the vultures surrounding above.

Replay value is surprisingly high - even with the fixed deck of card each family has, the order in which they come, chances what you need to do; and each family has 5 members, with one of them being chosen as the leader, and the ability of any of them have impact in the play - it is as if the game came with 25 races.

Theme is present and there is some care to bring it forth. But adding people like Doreah as a key person in the Targaryen family (if you don't even know who she is, that is ok), or allowing Shireen to by the leader of the Baratheon, truly take players out of the immersion in the theme.

In the end, even if [thing=204837][/thing] has some nice features, as one player properly appointed, [thing=204837][/thing] brought several of the issues in [thing=39463][/thing] (luck, bashing) and made them worst, while not adding more fun - the encounters are more predictable, and bad card draws can bury your chances even more than in [thing=39463][/thing]. While it can run shorter, I much rather have a hearty and longer cosmic affair than a quibble for an iron throne.

Improved version of Cosmic Encounters, Less swingy and random, but there is probably less variability too.

Mechanically similar to CE but for fans of the GoT series it wins out on theme. Card images are actual shots of characters from the series rather than artistic renderings.

Played it once so far, but I'm not yet comfortable enough with the flow of the game and the rules to rate it. I think I prefer Cosmic Encounter, but I have to play this game some more to form a final opinion.

RATING: 5
[EDIT] I quite like CosmicEncounters but I didn't like this very much... too fiddly and disconnected, there's nothing helping me remember what happens in the different cases, releasing hostages or torturing them in different cases...; our game was just too random

Am I the first writing that... "I am intrigued!" ?

Review Date: May 2017

Disclaimers for context:I enjoy both the book and TV Series of the IP

Positives: As expected from FF, the production is excellent, although my personal preference would have been for artwork of the characters the photos of the actors are perhaps more recognizable to most and are well chosen. It plays very well with 4 or 5 and has that backstabbing game of thrones feel to it. It takes a lot that works well with Cosmic Encounter but is far less random than cosmic is with the alien powers, this may be a negative for many!

Negatives:  See above for more predictable outcomes/less randomness, perhaps a little light in depth for fans of Cosmic and maybe a little complex for just fans of the show

Conclusion: If you enjoy aspects of Cosmic Encounter and are a fan of Game of Thrones, it is a solid game that you will enjoy. If you are fan of the franchise, but don't play many board games, you might find it tough to get into. If you love the craziness of Cosmic, you might find this a little dull!

Score: For me it's an 8 - Cosmic Thrones!

This is Cosmic Encounter focused down to the world of Game of Thrones.  It is more structured.  And because of that it has great bluff/counter bluff options without being nearly random.

I think this game benefits by knowing the character decks gained through replay.  Deeper than CE at first glance without being any harder to play.  Nice Job FF.

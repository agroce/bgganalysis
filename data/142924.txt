A fun spin on the hidden traitor game, one that makes partial information a key part of the game. Very likeable. Probably a bit broken.

RATING: 8
After reading the rules this game seemed convoluted... But after having played I found it to be very easy. This is a different take on the "The Resistance" genre, but the actual playing is very different, on The Resistance you're doing the same for each 5 missions, here the game has a first suspicion phase, then some players get the benefit of the doubt, then 2 of these become Reliable, and finally one of them enters the Cockpit, and becomes the Captain, then the Captain nominates another player to enter the Cockpit and that player chooses another one, and so on, until all "good players" are inside the Cockpit, if one infiltrator enters the Cockpit then the game is over and the infiltrators win.

Funded the game.  Played it now for the first time, I liked it, there were al lot of discussions going on. Will not rate it yet, not yet sure of the balance. For the moment I think it's a lot easier to win if you play the bad guys.

RATING: 8
The first playthrough was a bit rocky, but once we figured out the rules, we played it four more times in about an hour and had a blast.  The most fun I've had yet playing a hidden-traitor game.  Great art, too (although I may be a bit biased).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
 Basically a single round of Resistance (so, more streamlined) that packs a lot of punch. We got some rules wrong, but the feel of it came through and I really liked it. It needs more plays before I can decide if it's a replacement for Resistance or just another one like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A little resistance-like, but not nearly as elegant in design.   The rules confused a number of players throughout much of the game, and even in the second play it was hard to keep track of what the goal was and what you were supposed to be doing.   

Apart from that, it was still an interesting game and I'd like to play it more.

RATING: 7
A hidden role game where information is filtered to you in a nice structured way for players to work out the good from the bad. Quite amusing that the voting options aren't yes and no. They are Protect or Punch in the Face. 1 Play.

RATING: 7.5
This is the Puerto Rico of werewolf games. You don't explain the whole rule set at the beginning of the game, just the basic idea of narrowing down who's in and who's out until you get one captain, and the captain must pick all the honest crew members to win. As you go through the game, explain the rules for each phase right then.

Great strategic deduction game.  More meat to it than others.

Again, more plays and rating may go up.

RATING: 6
The Resistance, but with more hard facts.

The problem with this game is that it's incredibly difficult to win as evil.  "Spies" have to not only get lucky, but they have to be 100% convincing in their deceit.  If not, then they just straight up lose.

It's almost the opposite of the Resistance in this regard, where it's Team Good that has to play a perfect game in order to win.

Comparing this game to The Resistance (Avalon) there's a cool difference. In this game, when there's double crossing, actual proof stays on the table. Nice.
That's not to say either game has my preference.

A deduction and bluffing game that works very well, although in my first game, I never got to look at a third card at all (consequently, we lost). I didn't really mind. Of course, there are various games of this kind, but this one impressed me more than some others.

Great game! The next evolution of hidden role fillers, in the tradition of Resistance, Werewolf Inquisition, etc.

What's neat about this one is the large amount of information available due to the notekeeping present in the game. In theory this should make it easier for the good guys, but their win condition is exact and difficult!

In 2015, the theme is almost shocking, especially with recent current events. That said, I like the theme more than, say, Resistance.

But in every other way, I prefer Resistance. Here there is too much information available to players, or at least more than I would prefer. I like pure lies, or less trackable information. Playing this is sort of like playing Werewolf or Resistance in a PBF setting, where every vote is scrutinized. It's a nice change of pace, but not something that's going to replace any other game in the genre for me.

It is in the same vein as Avalon/Ultimate Werewolf

In Mayday!Mayday! all players are flight crewmembers aboard flight LK-886, on which the pilot has suddenly died. A heart attack? Poison? Murder? The copilot must now take the lead, but other crewmembers distrust him. The crew believes there are infiltrators amongst them. But who? A skirmish occurs. Will all infiltrators get exposed?

Resistance on a plane.  Deduction, bluffing traitor game.  Chits to avoid needing to remember players evidence. Good but prefer the resistance.

While there is more visible information in this game than the resistance, there isn't enough to properly deduce, and not the same hard information as is available in the resistance.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Resistance with some changes, that seem for worse. You don't get many facts to think about, but there's plenty of discussing about who lied and why.

It really depends on the players to have fun, on how they address this kind of social games. You really need players willing to get involved.

less intuitive than the resistance. More deduction, less social. The only thing holding it back, are the slightly unintuitive rules. Everytime I try to play it there's confusion somewhere.. Even though it really isn't that difficult. Then I think to myself: we could just as well be playing the resistance.

This game by Corné van Moorsel is a coop. All players form a flight crew and the pilot has just been found dead in the cockpit. There are good guys and some bad guys in the flight crew and each group has its own agenda.

In this game, each player receives a card with a designated role and a further one good and one bad card. These three cards are placed in front of the player. At the start, each player may view one card of each of the two neighbors and indicate whether he saw a good or a bad card.

In a game round one person may see a card from another player. So by conduct and indications you get some limited information.

We played the game with eight and it took a while before the game got underway and it suddenly was over.
Yet I see a welcome game for lovers of Resistance looking for some variation.

My enthusiasm for traitor games should be well-known by now. I was undecided about this one (mostly since the written rules are a steaming pile of shit that you need to read at least five times until they start making any sense), but buying it was not a mistake.

Back at home we played two rounds by now. It's mostly a deduction game: Given the information on the table, can you determine at least one configuration in which at most two of the players have lied? Or, if you are one of the traitors: Can you come up with an explanation in which at most two players have lied, [i]and you are not one of them[/i]?

And hey, I wrote my diploma thesis about deduction games (in case I have not mentioned it often enough already). It's a nice game.

P.S.: For clarity's sake: The rules themselves are absolutely okay, just the way they are conveyed to the reader would benefit from some cleanup.

If you enjoyed the Resistance but the game has since grown stale in your usual group, definitely look up Mayday Mayday! It is a more satisfying and meatier game with a stronger slant on deduction, but can you talk your way out of doom faster than others can deduce? Absolutely in love with this game!

Of course there are many games out there in this genre.
However, I have to admit that the element of deduction does add a lot of spice to this game.

Deduction.
Bluffing.
Lying.
And probably shouting.

This comes at a time when people seem to be craving more deterministic social games as Resistance core & Avalon tend to be fairly unpredictable which is certainly the point with those games, but I appreciate why determinism might be a welcome alternative at the least. While I will always favour the super-talky, super chaotic Avalon, these more mechanical social games give those slightly more introverted players a bit of leverage in talking up the game.

Mayday! Mayday! sounds absolutely hilarious so I'm keen to run it soon.

Played once.

Interesting social deduction game that certainly reminds of The Resistance.

Before playing the game and after reading the manual, I'd expected the game to be leaning toward the bad guys, since at the end of the game ALL the good guys have to be in the cockpit, which means there's no room for error and one mistake is instantly a win for the traitors. 
However, over the course of the game it became apparent to me that the game actually seemed a little tilted toward the good guys. I was one of the bad guys and my two teammates were instantly distrusted from the first round onward. It became very clear that in this game the bad guys have to work together even more than in Resistance or Werewolf to spread confusion and distrust, because in this game it's easier for the good guys to confirm someone else's statements by looking at other players' cards. 
In the end, the good guys won pretty easily. Opinions were mixed, the overall consensus being that we really should try it out again another time to see whether this is an adequate replacement for our beloved game The Resistance if we want some variety if we want to play a social deduction game.

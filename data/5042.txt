Was supposed to take place in Europe but the wall came down and the game migrated.  Very interesting perspective into Command and Control.  The final evolution of the Next War system.

Interesting system emphasising 'deep battle' concepts.When laid out the map shows what a thin and small piece of land Israel really is. On the must try list.

There is apparently a set or rules allowing this game system to be retrofitted to SPI 'Fifth Corps' series.

Another Mark Herman classic; he's amazingly versatile, and one of my favorite designers for modern-era conflicts (see The Next War, Gulf Strike, and Aegean Strike); I may just try the Flashpoint: Central Front variant someday soon.

I really like this game system.  It works great in the Golan, and it is also working well for a variant in Europe in the 1980's called Flashpoint: Central Front.  The system has enough playability to make it fun while at the same time enough detail and chrome to make it a decent simulation.

Even tiny actions take an inordinate amount of effort to
preform in this game. One of the most detailed operational
designs out there, it is just too much for my tastes. Pity
too, because it provides a very accurate model of modern
warfare - but there's just a limit of what I find palatable
in a game.

Complex mechanics make for highly realistic game.  However I'm not sure I care for the chit-driven system.  Nonetheless it's a fascinating look at a heavily armed, volatile region as it existed circa 1991.  Beautiful map and really nice counters.

Interesting mechanics that gel pretty well after a little play.  A good design with a few quibbles (cruise missiles are too powerful - a legacy of the initial Central Front setting?).  Definitely a keeper, overdue for a revival.

RATING: 5
If you like Battalion/Brigade level control games than you should give this a try.  I feel it is weighted in favor of the Israeli's, but I think this just represents the technological advantages the IDF has over the Syrians etc.  But the Arabs can win this game, if they are fast and focused.

"Turning within enemy decision cycle" Mark Herman stated in this game, and he by used the momentum mechanism simulated that. Let me tell more on that, whenever do battle the win side will gain some pts called momentum pt, when the pt reach a level, it will provided additional activition chit for that side, and when that additional chit picked up, the side can choice one of his formation to move and fight once more. I always pefer Random formation activition game rather than my turn move, combat, then your turn move combat system. In additional to random formation activition with momentum mechanism, I think it is the bestest operation level system, to simulated the progress of a war.

Due to the playability, The Air-superiority issue will handled by die-roll, bsaically Israel will own it on 2-3 days. So players will only concentrated on the land units operations. Any operation maybe trigger reactions, reaction is a kind of operation too, so in the early stage of the war there are tons of reactions. This is also a unforgetable game experience.

With a good and playable game system, however the battle field is not good for gaming, there are only few roads for tanks or trucks moved into Golan or West Bank. With a smart Arab player, destory all bridges will make Israeli more hard to do a lighting movement. Moreover The hilly ground around Golan Arab player using a Syrian SF unit defend in a +2 fortified location. you can only elminated it by 10% chance of Air Stirke, 10% chance of land battle with that is 4:1 combat ratio (max ratio)

So this game got "8". As Mark Herman said, It should be Flashpoint: German, however at that time being, The end of cold war, make him considered the game focused on the protential conflict area Middle-East to be a modern wargame at that time. Now hope him consider release a historical wargame - Flashpoint: German :)

Smart design from Mr Herman.
If you want to play a near contemporary scenario over Israel area, this is undoubtedly the BEST game.

Rules are a bit hard to digest (mainly to the constant interaction of different arms and also due to it's extension -27 pages) but they are well written. 

Recommended just for experienced gamers. A true gem if only for it's original and innovative mechanism.

Unfortunately there are not any replays on this game available on the net, apart from that included in the rules.

The system has me intrigued!
Especially the concept of gaining and losing momentum, and using this to 'pay' for operations (which I may have misunderstood a bit, but there seems to be soo many other interesting bits under the engine!). 

Looong out of print from Victory Games, this one will have to be found - not that simple.

- actually it turned out to be just that simple :)

Game system is great and easy to learn and understand. I'm wondering why no further expansion to fit modern conflicts.
I should score it at 8 but now just 7.5. It is because
1. Modern warfare is not my most favorite game;
2. Jordan River is totally let Arab has no hope to win.

RATING: 5
On paper, a fascinating system.  The set-piece battle mechanism reminds of 48th PzKorps, a personal favourite.  The reaction cycle mechanism is very unusual and feels very appropriate for modern warfare. That said, the system is very luck-dependent as many results are of a yes/no type with massive impact (artillery/air strikes, HQ detection, even the breaks in the ground CRT), and the variable TQ outcomes which stick through a whole scenario like an albatross.  After some short scenarios, I thought, wow, this is among the best of the bunch.  After an abortive campaign that introduced us to the critical breakpoints in the strange CRT, I must say that playing this two-player can turn into an exercise in frustration.  Something to be solitaired for the experience.

Update: Now into the fifth game. After abandoning the campaigns for the scenarios, turns out the first scenario is another pointless exercise in Arab headbashing. The detailed example in the rules makes it look more interesting by having the Arabs win a critical attack that has only a 30% chance of succeeding, and then admits that the chitpulls on turn 2 can basically defeat them anyway.  The last hope at this point are the historical scenarios - Peace for Galilee and the Yom Kippur variant from the Boardgamer.

RATING: 10
Simply on of the best contemporary era operational games available. The formation activation, the battle mechanichs with each player adding always more strikes in the hope to break the opposing line before sending the merkava (war chariots in the litteral meaning) to the fore, the exploitation phase (if you have made the hole)... and the  system is surprisingly easy to assimilate. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Simply the best modern operational warfare game at it`s time. Innovative system that gives the player a real flavour of modern combat. Complex but playable:you MUST go through the example of play as this clears up many of the questions you might have about the rules. It also helps to think about modern doctrine and use this: those units are organised that way for a reason and they're not just bits of card! You have to consider what job they're there to do....playability is enhanced if you're organised about bookkeeping and have multiple players (but you can say this about any monster game).

Complex operational design.

Looks interesting (momentum driven turn sequence) with a certain view or near future operational level warfare which emphasized attacks on vulnerable rear elements using missiles and artillery.

Traded without being played, but would still be interested in trying this game if I could find willing players.  Also wished they had retained the original Central Front setting, but probably not possible given the changed geopolitical situation at the time.

Very intricate and involving.  It's also very interesting in light of the last 25 years of history in the region, how things have changed when you look at the FP Golan Map and compare it to the real world now.   There's no special rule for Assad attacking his own people, there's certainly no US drone strike capability, and no UK ground forces.  Areas that were DMZ or peace keeping controlled in the game are now in real life Israel. Gaza strip is not mentioned in any game scenario (though the west bank is).  It would be interesting to see this game get an update of course, but as it stands it's fascinating with its 1989 view of the then middle east and then then perceivable / conceivable potential futures.

Good game to get a good idea of what Israeli and Arab forces were up against until the late eighties and early ninties.
While Israel almost always has to deal with a number of opponents, the Arab Nations always have to deal with Israeli air superiority, better technology and US support(technology and supplies). 
This game also gives you a good insight of the mayhem in Lebanon in the eighties. 
Though the game has several variants it is easy to get a complete escalation of any variant cause the lack of rules regarding intervention.

I played two campaign scenarios. It seems to me that the game is very static due to the risk of reaction by the other player (artillery, air, SRBM). Since the game is also rather tedious to play and very unbalanced (in favor of Israel), it's no wonder that it was not a big hit. I sold it in 2006.

Beautiful maps covering Israel, Lebanon, the West Bank, parts of Jordan and Syria to Damascus.  Interesting scenarios covering a full scale PLO uprising to combined Syrian and Jordanian assaults with Iraqi support.  A bit outdated in some regards assuming Iraq as a major contestant (who knew in 1991?) this game still offers a multitude of possible future engagements.

RATING: 5.5
Very neat system covering operational combat in the Middle East.  The maps are very nicely done and do a great job of highlighting the terrain in the area.  The rules are pretty short and easy to follow and learn.  Counters are standard NATO icons.

Playbalance is decent as the Arab forces can, in most cases, stand up defensively at least to the Israeli forces until the imbalance of airpower takes over about mid-way thru scenarios (see comments on Strikes to follow).  

There's a neat metric to determine troop quality (big factor in fighting) wherebye a roll is made against the training level of units (elite, 1st line, reserve, militia) when it enters combat for the first time.  HQs are handled rather abstractly, but contribute very important capabilities (air defense, engineering, rally, etc...) key to surviving and winning battles.

Combat is also very involved due to the ability to support or not support with artillery or reserves.  Maintaining reserves is critical unlike most games since the ability to breakthrough and exploit is VERY real.  Winning or losing also determines momentum which provides initiative and bonus activations.  My issue with this is once your opponent has a heavy momentum advantage, it's virtually impossible to reverse since you must win big fights to redress the imbalance (and if your opponent is leading in momentum he likely got there by smashing your units leaving you w/ little to counterattack with).

Two issues : 

1.  Strikes.  The detection and strike capabilities seem a bit too powerful as virtually any moving unit can be detected and attacked as long as you have airstrikes or artillery to use.  This can slow play down and causes an unreal ability to interdict anything behind the lines.  Maybe a house rule to limit detection or keep the detection rules and add a roll / DRM to be allowed to strike?

2.  Scenarios.  The ones already 'built' are a bit limited and apparently low on replayability.  The hypothetical ones are a bit better.  I've elected to ignore the Superpower & UN Intervention aspects of the game, but that does add to the variation.  The plus : there's a very quick, simple way to build your own scenarios based off certain regional conditions.

I would highly recommend any game using this or similar systems.

Lowered rating from 7 to 5.5
I've now played this 3-4 times and fail to see how the Arab armies can make a very interesting go of this in any scenario where they have to attack.  Seems the two key parts of combat (morale and the gaining of momentum; not to mention the overpowering IAF!) are distinctly weighted against the Arabs (not saying this may not be historically accurate, but it ain't fun for a game).  Not sure I'll get this back on the table any time in the near future.

I don't remember when I bought my first copy for $5.00 at a discount store. I never played it, but I read through the rule book two or three times. I had two General issues (v28 nr1 and nr2) that had long articles about it.
I don't remember what happened to all of that.
Two years ago, I replaced it all from eBay, along with General v30 nr1 that has a short article.
I still haven't played it, but I will. It's intended for two players, but nothing is hidden, so it should solo easily enough.

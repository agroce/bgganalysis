Game has good theme play. However, it was too short and boring.  No action was required to win.  Just place playing pieces (thugs, vamp & etc.) in a pricey location to extort money quickly to get to the $10,000 victory condition.  Very little player interaction needed.  The components are very good.

I think the first game you really don't want to play with a timer because it takes you a while to figure out what's going on, but after that, the timer is really required.

a fun beer and pretzels, game, but my language deteriorates atrociously in this game as I'm referring to the pieces on the board.  I think that I'd hold off on playing this with kids because of that.

Seemed to be a fun game, and then once I finally read the rules, and we began playing at a con, I'm going out on a limb here, but I think JP took the included squirtgun and started to have his way with everyone's face.  This led to the eventual breakdown of the game, and the permanent shelving of the game.  I was too disgruntled to take it out again.  B O O H O O.

Teetering on a 9, I really need to play it more to figure out if the little squabbles I have with are worth b&%ching over.  I think this is really a neat piece of game design, there's a lot of really smart (and thematic) rules that lend the game a great flavor.  It has some Euro ideas in there but it's really theme-rich, which is an absolute necessity for me.  I do think that the "exact move" rule is kind of dodgy and seems to extend the game as players try to figure out which of several possible routes they can take.  There might be a little too much micromanagement, but I kinda like that about it.  This is a better game than Bootleggers and it's a lot more interesting than most Euros.  A little bit ahead of its time, it plays sort of like a modern hybrid.  BUT THEY DON'T COME WITH A SQUIRT GUN, DO THEY????

RATING: 6
Great game, a reprint of Supergang (so I&#039;m not sure Greenwood was the designer!).  Players play a faction of gangsters that must exert their influence on property in town.  Players roll five coloured dice, each colour representing a gangster or cops/public, then start a timer to allocate out the die moves. Some very novel mechanics via the die roll allocation system, and some good chromey stuff like &quot;wheels&quot;, &quot;heaters&quot; and &quot;vamps&quot;.

Surprisingly fun AH title.... strange levels of abstraction in this title. Instead of charts cards to show levels of conrol or criminal activity, you have wargamey-type chits for your Thugs and Racketeers. You try to herd the public into your shadey Chigaco mob establishments. While odd, it is a satisfying and tense game. In no time you find yourself speaking the words "rub him out" and "get that vamp into his joint"... and assaulting your friends with the squirtgun (provided). A classic.

RATING: 6
An odd duck, this one. The core of the game offers some rather interesting dice-drafting decisions depending on the endgame goal you're pursuing (money, monopoly, or ownership). Choosing your own victory condition and the turn-to-turn dice decisions all work well for a reasonably compelling experience. Where the game breaks down is in its roll-and-move mechanism.

Each turn you roll five dice and, after using one compulsory die, you get to choose two actions from the remaining dice. Not all but most of these choices will be to move your own or neutral pieces around the board into positions whereby you can earn money. Thing is, you have to use the exact number of the die. So there's a lot of counting and watching other people count to see which pieces they can move where. The game can degrade into 5+ minute turns as people count out all -- and I mean ALL -- their possible choices then contemplate which ones to choose. It ... felt... ponderous. 

To solve this problem, the game imposes a two-minute time limit. Sounds good, right? But this just means that people count out their options before starting the timer. I was averaging 15+ minutes between turns without the timer and 10 minutes with the timer. Still a slog. The result is the game takes so much longer to play relative to the quantity of interesting decisions it offers. 

As to the gameplay itself, "monopoly with violence" is an apt description. You move your pieces and neutral pieces (the public) into positions that make passive money for you each turn. Then it becomes incumbent on other players to spend their precious actions attacking your positions rather than building up their own. Like in Monopoly, at some point someone will get better rolls and start to run away with it and then it's just a grinding down of everyone else from there. 

Perhaps if turns were truly 2 minutes long and the timer was started as soon as the previous player was paid and things hummed along, it'd reach a level of speed and hilarity that was intended rather being ponderous. After all, the game actually comes with an included squirt gun that you're supposed to shoot each other with. This was one play with a bunch of new players. I'd give it another try to see.

Gets an extra point for exquisite use of theme.  Fun game, but a lot of downtime.  The two minute timer is good to keep the game moving, but since it was the first play for all except the owner, it was a guideline rather than a hard and fast rule.  Takes a lot longer to play than one would initially think.  Lots of depth to it.  Nothing more frustrating (in a fun way) than hiring a new thug for $400 just to see him succumb to the charms of a rival's vamp before you even get to give him an order.  Would like to try again when more time is available.

To avoid water damage to the game board (and to keep in line with the theme), it is essential that you get up out of your seat, walk behind your victim, and squirt him in the back of the head...execution style.  I fell prey to a few throat shots.  Cold blooded killers in my group...

Rather strangely for a late Avalon Hill game, this is entirely dominated by die rolling. Since the dice decide both your movement capability and the price of upgrades, it determines your tactics as you move when the value is high, buy when it's low. A modern designer would have made much more of this theme. Not the best of AH.

Very nice mix of skill and luck and the timed moves prevent any analysis paralysis.

Players who like to take a long time to think about their moves will probably not like this game, but it speeds along nicely with the enclosed egg timer.

Because there are multiple ways to win, the game plays differently for each player and sometimes you cannot tell who is in the lead.  Probably best played with four or five.

Finally got a chance to play, and you know, it played a lot better than my initial reading of the rules suggested.  The two minute timer added immensely to the game, the winning goals were not impossible to attain, and there was quite a bit of agonizing about moves.  This is coming off my trade pile now.  A couple viable paths to victory, and plays pretty much on 45 minutes/player.

RATING: 7.5
A crime game that's steeped in theme.  You can use your thug to extort or beat up on others.  Your racketeer can help you take over property (new joints you control) and your vamp literally sucks the skills out of your opponents or uses her wile to extort.  Cops can bust crimes but can be bribed and the public can be used to increase profits through organized crime.  There are a good number of choices and movement options (secret passages through buildings you own, subways, the mean streets).  Playing with a 2 minute timer makes the game clip along at a good pace and builds some excitement in trying to figure out the best tactical moves before the buzzer goes off.  Oh! and let's not forget that if you successfully gun your opponents you get to shoot them with a water gun.  

My only problem is with the win conditions.  It seems much easier to win by money than through buildings acquired.  If you go for the buildings win then it becomes much more difficult to compete with those just trying to accumulate profits.  Seems this could be fixed if your equity was somehow added to your profits.  Additionally, the $10K win condition comes by way to quick -- especially considering that payments can often be 3K - 5K with a good organized crime setup.  Seems that 15K or 20K would make more sense.

I played this at WBC 2007, thanks to my friend Kaarin Engelmann. We started at midnight and played until 4 in the mornig, then we went to bed and at 8 I was playing the We the People tournament, a game I had never tried before. After two games, the Monsters Menace America tournament started and I left the American revoution follow its path.

Oh yes, Gangsters was a nice game. Pretty different from other AH titles of the same time. In fact, it is a true Euro, with lots of player interaction.

Chaotic but fun. Hard to control your own destiny admidst other players whims and wants. Lots of luck. Bad die rolls will do you in everytime. As gameplay possibilities go, all you can do is minimize the bad ones and maximize the good ones as best you can and hope the dice are with you.

RATING: 8
Like most AH games, Gangsters is not a 'light' game. It comes complete with seven pages of small-font rules (similar in complexity to Merchant of Venus). Plan on spending a few hours playing it. (The box says playing time is 45 minutes per player.) Each player controls a gang during the Roaring 20s. Your gang includes a racketeer (for purchasing property), a thug (for extortions and shootouts), and a vamp (for seduction of rival gang members). The game board looks somewhat like the bird's eye view of properties in Chinatown. Each turn you roll five colored dice and have only two minutes (timer not included) to figure out how best to move your racketeer (green die), thug (black die), vamp (red die), cop (blue die), and public (white die). There are plenty of strategic decisions to be made and the timer keeps play moving right along. You win by controlling ten properties (joints), or controlling all properties of the same color group, or by earning $10,000. With these three victory conditions it is not always clear who is in the lead--a nice feature.

Now for the real surprise. Gangsters comes complete with a squirt gun! Its use is optional, but I highly recommend it to spice up the game. I quote from the rules, "12.8 Crime Does Not Pay: Each time a player loses a gangster strength point in a Shootout, he may be 'shot' with the squirt gun as an added incentive to avoid Gang Wars or Shootouts with the Cops."

Gangsters is for 2-5 players but works best with four. If five play, the fifth player controls the cops (instead of a gang). In all of our 5 player games, the cop never won but sure had fun with the squirt gun!

Just seeing the shock of your fellow gamers when you unveil the squirt gun is worth the purchase price.

Monopoly with hits...gotta love it.  I do like the water pistol, it not only adds flavor to an already flavorful game, but the great thing is is that after you hit someone they tend to forget about the pistol and a well placed shot in their ear reminds them real quick.  Definately a fun game

Takes far too long to play for a game of this weight. Strong dose of king-making as well.
As much a social exercise as anything - you don't want to either offend another player (and have them harass you for the rest of the game) or do too well early on. Better to stay with the pack and lunge - but everyone else is likely to do the same, so the end becomes arbitrary and makes a joke of the first 60-80 minutes. Worst possible outcome is to get distracted by a feud with another player.

A neat old-school Avalon Hill game with some really clever mechanics.  You roll 5 dice at once, and each color die corresponds to a different type of piece.  You basically run around town extorting money, setting up gambling joints for the public, sending the police to harrass your opponents, and getting into gunfights.  Fun, and a really nice set of components - including a real squirt gun for use in gun battles!

Rating for AH version.  My only experience was in the well-run WBC tournament using the timer, which I feel is essential.  Trouble is, time pressure meant that while I took my turn I did not feel the theme at all; I just thought about optimizing my moves.  The board is big enough that players don't have to fight if they don't want to, another factor that subtracts from the gang war theme.  The only reason I can see to attack another gang is to stop it from winning.  Fighting does not help you win, it only slows down both parties, so "Let's you and him fight" is the best strategy.

Quite a fun game.  This game is just entrenched in theme.  You have cops in your pocket, you run raids against each other, you try to move the people into your establishments (done before Bus or Marracash.)

Very simple and probably too chaotic, but does that matter if you are having a good time.  Be sure to set a timer for increased tension.

Interesting economy game from the later years of Avalon Hill. Game play reminds a bit of Air Baron (also AH, but even later: 1996), because return on investments is somewhat random. At the same time you have to ride the proabilities while thinking about an all-out aggression versus the perceived leader (as with Fare Wars in Air Baron).
An added bonus is the 2-minute-rule which I had not seen anywhere else before in a strategy game like this.

The exact move rule, and the fact that you can plant a vamp & thug into a spot and just collect money from round to round till disturbed, makes this game way too random for my taste.  But with some home rules, though, this game could be brilliant.  Lots to like about this one.

Only played once. Pretty good game but familiarity with the board would be a huge help. As knowing where the buildings are is very important. We played a lax game but once people know the game and you enforce a 2 minute a turn time limit I think this would make it pretty fun.

It has all the elements of a fun and exciting game, it just isn't. Still got to roll some dice.

This game is tons of fun. A bit lengthy for what it is, but I love to play it. There's more strategy beneath all that die rolling than it seems. This is an excellent game that I love to play every year at the WBC.

This is the Avalon Hill game, not the Tom Wham game with the same name. One of his few that I don't have a copy of.

Hmm, don't think I really need to play this again. Dark board gave it an unecessarily dark atmosphere.

I've played this game once and it had a nice mix of strategy and trash talking, and you could shoot them with a water gun when you ransacked their place. I'm sure there's more possibilities, but I gotta play some more games..

Very politically incorrect (so I kinda liked it!). How often do you get to rack up the dough from being a bad guy?

3 different victory conditions is good. Hard to win. A very tight theme.

A unique game bringing together elements such as roll & move by exact count on a timer, dice combat, real estate development, and alternating control over a shared weapon (the cops) & the major source of income (the public). It comes together very well, being both abstract and consistent with its theme of 1930's organized crime. The game's mechanics ensure outright warfare is kept to a minimum while also making it absolutely necessary from time to time.

not Hollywood mobster but more of a mobster simulation.  If you go in shooting up the place it will attract the police and that is bad for business.

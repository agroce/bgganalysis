I love this game! It is really easy to teach and it has that infectious quality where you keep wanting to play just one more hand.

A fun little filler. Not enough strategy to have me reaching for it often, but it's fun, gets your endorphins rolling as you try to sneak in cards first, and it's anyone's game - no unfair advantages early on. Will play again, but will not rush to play again.

This is a very simple game of symbol matching.  It is very easy to teach, but not really a game for more experienced gamers.

I could see this being an interesting bar game, watching people play after a drink or two.

A favorite in our house - it is fast paced and chaotic, and just right for getting everyone involved.  Parents can easily play against kids, and will quite often lose to the younger players.  Any Looney Labs game is awesome, most existing in the inexpensive, fun and silly category.

Hard to rate this. I'm not very good at speed games, and therefore I don't often enjoy them, but LOONACY has proved to be a smash hit with my casual gamer friends! They can't get enough of it! 

I actually have a pretty good time playing this, because the rounds are so quick and I can usually get THIS close to winning, but never quite beat them to the punch.

A fun quick game. There is not much to the game other than putting cards down, but you need to be quick about it. Great for a quick game between larger games or while waiting for other players.

Lots of random fun, great to show to guests. Easier to explain, play and jump into than Fluxx, does not overstay its welcome.

Well, here's the thing: I generally don't like speed games.  Loonacy is a speed game.  So, you know, it has that against it from the start.  It's a light card game in which the object is to get rid of all the cards in your hand by playing to the table in real time, matching images on the cards.  For a speed game, it really wasn't that bad.  If you like speed games, you might like it.

RATING: 6
Loonacy is a small, light, fun game that is great to play while sitting around a table when you only have a few minutes to spare or you have very limited space to play a game in.

It seems the Looney Labs logo is a reliable sign that a game is not for me. In this perception/reaction game everyone tries to get rid of cards in real time by putting them on a stack. There's less maintenance work than in Pick-a-Foo - just deal some cards and go - but also no very compelling reason to play in the first place.

Similar to a Spot-it feel.  I think it's a cute game.  I'm not sure how much value it gives over something like Spot-It though..

We like two kinds of games: Games with Theme and Strategic thought + lots of choices or Super Fun Games (which are often light fillers that create lots of conversation and engagement).  Loonacy is one of those ridiculously light games that none-the-less helps you shake off the stress of the day or provides a great lure for non-gamers.  Plus inexpensive so...

I'm not a big fan of speed games and that's all this extremely simple game is.  Put out domino-like cards from your hand matching the discard piles on the table as fast as you can and the first to empty their hand wins.  In summary I don't like speed games because they reward physical ability more than gameplay in my opinion.  But even if I did, this game is too simple to be any interesting, it just seems boring.

I am keeping this copy however because it is a custom deck made for my local Game Store which I support.  The card backs have the store's logo and name on them and the art is all game pieces such as dice, cards, and miniatures.

RATING: 5
Fun, but uber-light. Simple matching and speed game mostly for family and kids. Could work as very basic filler. Random set 2 images per card makes for double-taking and funny moves when frantic. But can have slow plays, too.

If Dobble didn't exist, or Geisteblitz, oe Jungle Speed and I had a much lower tolerance for the quality of game I was willing to play, Loonacy would still be terrible.

It's as though all of the interesting design choices and all of the tightening up that a publisher does has been ignored here. Did they print the cards first and then try and design a game around it?

So many better quick play fillers to choose from before this card game which offers nothing more than speedy picture matching.

I tried playing this with my daughter and she wanted to stop without finishing the game.  It just wasn't fun.

We like Blink which has some mechanics in common (no turns, matching) but this game is slow, boring, and pointless in comparison.  Maybe this would be better with younger kids, but I still think Blink is more fun for adults and kids.

I've had this game for ages, but it always seemed too complicated as a child, partly because of a poor translation of the rules (it's called "Marnon" in Finnish, after the island it takes place on). Now that I've read the rules in english, I think it might be a decent game.

Orc Frenzy!
I love how the designer was able to balance the random elements of the Wizard and the Orcs to add non-player challenges to the conquest of Marnon. I might give it a higher rating than my sons, who always want to team up and vanquish me, then find the randoms stop their plans and give me a fighting chance.

So, is Wizard's Quest like RISK? Well, yes... in the same way that Dixit is like Apples to Apples, or Defenders of the Realm is like Pandemic. The core combat and reinforcement mechanisms are reminiscent of -- though not the same as -- RISK, but that's where the comparison ends. The goal of this game is not world domination, but rather seeking out a set of treasures; the Wizard, Dragon, Sorcerer and Hero all add unique elements, as do the Orcs (an additional "player" of sorts, entirely controlled by the game itself). This game is another classic example of how dice can tell a story, and it offers a handful of managable choices and considerations to keep players engaged without bogging down the game. It's a solid medium-weight affair; just follow the superb rulebook, and after a turn or two you'll be off and running. Fun, compact, and deliciously vintage -- play it if you have even a marginal interest in games of this genre and/or era.

RATING: 7
30 Plays: When I was in highschool I received this game as a Christmas present from my brother. This game is one step up from Risk in complexity and can easily be used as a gateway game. The game does not center around conquest but rather achieving the goal of acquiring all your treasures. Opponents armies will clash and the combat system is basic but works well. Random elements of orcs, a Dragon, and the Peacemaker all add to the fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Easily the best "Risk" variant I've encountered. Mitigates the first turn advantage by randomizing the first player each game turn

In addition to a reasonable amount of tactical thought and careful positioning of men this ancient game also provides a lot of fun.

RATING: N/A
Talking about this game is important to remember that Wizard's Quest is an old time classic, therefore, it has neither modern rules nor a contemporary design. In my opinion, it has a big mechanism fault: you can exit the game without any opponent's intervention, but just for the action of PNGs. Sure, this is an element of uncertainty raising the tension of the match, but, time after time, the game can become a little 'frustrating'. However, it is a game worth trying, both for those who are beginners and want to play the classics of board fun.

Old copy that's been with me from my teen years.

A similar game as Risk in respect to it's mechanics, but with a fantasy theme and with a bit more gameplay going on. I played the heck out of this during my youth; so it holds a certain nostalgic charm to my eyes. 

The components are not bad despite it's age and the gameplay still engages you. It could become repetitive after a few plays, but it's definitely better than Risk.

A great game back in the eighties!

Depends on the group - if everyone goes out to grab the treasures then this is a relatively quick, fun game - gotta love the ORCS. However if players try the slow/sure approach of slowing building an empire it drags to mindless tedium levels. Oh, and combat is buckets of dice which some have a problem with ...

Pimped a bit with modified rules Ver.4.1 from Chris Conboy and a green dragon, Peacemaker the tin wizard, risk cubes as men at war and small sorcerers! Castlewalls can be upgraded and a DiY abandoned Hidden Mine system links the game-territories underground. Aswell as a new NPC, the famous Lord Bane, gets one random castle at start and attacks vice versa as the orc do their Frenzy assaults.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A classic which we enjoyed playing again and again and again in the '80s. Even now, while it's a little more fiddly thanmost of the German genre, it has a very nice mix of thinking, mindless luck and nice theming.

I really like how the Orcs add a little chaos to the game.  Sometimes, it seems like half the game is working the orcs, but it adds quite a bit.  It's not that close to Risk as the combat rules are simpler.

3 plays (2x3p, 6p). "The time of the orc is now!" Really enjoyed the full game with 3 people. Plays quickly. Lots of personality and a wild spirit... Seems like ameritrash fun in a Risklike mode, an aggressive and strongly themed dice game, but with more choices than Risk, different types of dice battle choices, and more to it in general. The map is very clever--for example, the middle territory, which suffers the Monkey in the Middle Syndrome, is also mountainous, giving defensive advantage. The tunnel removes the edge stasis (no "Australia"), while the river and lake add some semi-permeable internal boundaries. The find-your-3-treasures goal is a nicely gameable one that gives an appropriate sense of purpose. It also makes the competition slightly sideways, not 100% head-to-head against the other players, but also a race. The luck factor seems fine here given the number of things going on and the fast play of turns... And there are more tricks, tactics and strategy than I expected, much more than Risk. The connected territories rule is a bit like a "supply" rule which every wargame needs, right? Game time with 3p is less than 2 hours--and despite all the wild attacking and die rolls--very close, down to the last turn. That was probably my best WQ experience. 6p I think was too much turn-waiting for the optimal game, but still it had a very close finish. I think the treasure goal is key to the game's success. I would like to retry a variant (invented in my first game due to error) where the orcs multiple quite faster--creating a situation where it is in doubt that the players' forces can even survive on the island (thus cooperation/competition). This would involve more orcage--maybe simply removing the orc production rule limit of 4 orcs max per space (thus unlimited orc rage). I customized my copy with wooden bits--see gallery pics if interested.

I love this game, mostly for nostalgic reasons. The game is easy to learn and is very entertaining. We used to change the rules every now and then to speed up orc generation. This resulted in the players working together to kill the orcs until you could sneak in and pick up one of the treasures (interesting twist). Probably not a game for the hardcore gamers but certainly a fun game when in the mood for something light.

Below average in my opinion. It is a very basic multiplayer wargame with some good elements. The strategies are common sense for the most part. Good negotiations will help as always. The theme is ok. Overall it just doesn&#039;t have enough going for it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Indeed it does feel like Risk. The description of the way die rolls work leaves a bit to be desired IMO. The dragon and orcs and more like annoyances than true threats. The dragon can really rebalance the map quickly when few players are on the map by gobbling up tons of orcs.

Overall, the mechanics feel dated. Probably because of the Risk feeling to it.

I think my sisters bought this for me as a present when I was a kid, but it was way over my head at that age. But, it was fun to look at!

Update: Hey, I recently got to try this after one of my gaming buddies picked up a used copy. Not bad at all for a beer & pretzels game. It could definitely use a little love, especially the physical components, but it was kinda fun. If you or your kids are looking to upgrade from something like [i]Risk[/i], this wouldn't be a bad choice.

Some folks even prefer this over [i]Small World[/i], probably because of its less static nature. I may be in that camp, we'll see.

Better than risk. Orcs kind of take up a lot of time and there are a few rules that could use come clarification. (Do the orcs press attacks when they frenzy or do they just attack once then attack the next region? How can you move men from a territory that isn't attacking or assisting an attack on another region - sounds like you can't?)

And lots of little cardboard chits to lose. Still, an okay game if everyone is into it.

A check of the game page shows it's 50% not recommended with 2P which is what my one play was. I got off to a quick start and steamrolled to a turn 3 victory, so thankfully it was a short experience.

Received in trade 10/11/05   EDIT:  Traded away in math trade


DISCLAIMER:  I have only played the AI version.


I don't mind randomness, but WOW this game is quite full of it.  There's a lot going on here I like--the "AI" of the orcs as their menace spreads, the sorcerer and hero, the ability to supplement your forces (a big strategy missing from Risk, which would make it a much better game)

But still...random dragon popping around eating your guys, random orc attacks, big swings in combat thanks to high lethality rates (as many as four guys killed in one swath)...things just seem to hinge more than I'm comfortable on in the luck department.

I think a modern game like Quest for the Dragonlords has completely supplanted something like this.


If I ever get to the table, I will re-rate, as it's possible that playing with other people enhances the experience (though I don't look forward to handling that upkeep manually--ouch!)

It's cool to own an "older" game like this, but man, game design has come a LONG way, baby.

I have tried a few dungeon crawl games and have not appreciated them.  I try a new one every couple of months as there are people at the Game Night who really like them.  But as of yet I have not found the genre appealing.  So, this is the reason why I bought this game for $1 and sold it for $15.

Last 3-player game played in 45 minutes. Good for all ages. 5 players can take 1-2 hours.  I think the 3 hours (180mins) listed is too long.  I don't think this game is anything like risk (very rare somebody tries to empire build - mechanics are against it).  This may explain why some people take hours and hours playing and others, who play it as a 'capture the flag' type of game play alot quicker.

Played 20+ Have not played this for years but I used to play all the time. Great fun. All players at some stage in the game think they are the one who is going to win. It would be great to see this game re-released with the card counters replaced with plastic figures. *UPDATE* I had the chance to play Wizard's Quest recentally and I turned it down. Fond memories but I have moved on. I am not sure what it is, maybe the rules are a little too involved and the game length a little too long. I have lower my rating. May 03

Breeding Orcs, Bouncing Dragons, and a Demented Wizard causing our simple island realm to descend into total chaos.  Collecting the treasures is a great way to go.  The one big problem is that the placement of the treasures needs to be good and well balanced, because one poor player can give the game to another.

Better alternative to something like Risk and doesn't take all day to play.  Reasons to attack more clear than to draw a reinforcement card.  A little chaotic, but with right attitude and play for fun, it doesn't bother me at all.  I like subbing in plastic figures from other games, Lord of the Rings Risk works very well, also look at Warlords of Europe, Age of Mythology, Risk Godstorm....etc....

RATING: 5
Area control game with a twist of collecting treasures. Lots of random elements: every turn includes a dragon that gobbles soldiers, a wizard who propagates soldiers, orcs prone to frenzying, and cards which can be very good or bad. I like some luck in a game, but all these elements can undermine even the best strategy. Thus, the game can be frustrating and limited to light play.

  Delightful game! My non-gamer friends really like this one, so it sees a lot of play.
  Love how the treasure set-up intrinsically pits players against one another and takes the dynamic of the game well beyond risk. The randomized orcs / dragon / wizard is also a fantastic element I really like.
   I mean, it's not many games where orcs who aren't controlled by a player are WINNING.

RATING: 8
(01/2014) Classic chit-fest, "Dudes on a Map" game, from Avalon Hill's days of yore.

It is classic Risk, upgraded into a fantasy setting, with some additional rules. Instead of player elimination, it is a race/quest to find three of your own hidden treasures scattered on the board, while battling it out against the other players and the orc hoards. Each player has a hero and a sorcerer, which are like the commanders in Risk:2210 A.D., giving them additional powers. The battles are fought on a fantasy island, scattered with castles and various terrain, which affect combat. There are also boats that allow convoys. The most interesting feature of the game are the Orcs, who spawn and then frenzy, attacking indiscriminately (sort of like the allies in 2-player Risk, but under no one's control). There's also a Dragon that flies around munching on orcs and human alike, as well as a Wizard that visits and enforces peace in a given region, as well as doling out petition cards (aka "the good stuff"). Played it a number of times back in high school, where there were some games the orcs almost wiped out the players. Great fun. Acquired a good copy from eBay in 2010 for the nostalgia. Nowadays, it is difficult to bring to the table, since some members of my gaming group do not like war games. Nevertheless, it is a solid "8".

I recall playing this with my friends as a teen.  We had a great time and played it quite a bit.  It needs 4 or more players.  Randomness is certainly a factor but oh well.  I am not afraid of dice.  Dice rolling leads to lots of anticipation and strategy busting/booming when the dragon attacks or orcs frenzy you or the enemy.  This is a one of AH's more playable games for those who are not into full-on strategy games.

Wizard's Quest offers a highly tactical and wildly unpredictable fantasy gaming experience. Troop placement is critical as you seek to acquire your treasures, but your plans are subject to the swooping dragon, frenzying orcs, and how the dice fall. These random elements, while certain to interfere with your plans, make the game memorable. You will groan in agony as the dragon devours your newly placed army, and moments later shout with delight as the wizard favors you with extra soldiers and a bonus attack. Without such moments, the game would surely be a dry, soulless shell. As it is, Wizard's Quest is a light, fun game that has the potential to entertain both casual and serious gamers.

Well, the Risk is certainly strong in this one. I'm also prepared to believe it's more enjoyable than Risk, even with the combined luck elements of card drawing and dice rolling, and the prospect of a game going on forever. This may not be saying all that much, though. I've only played it against bots on the computer, so I can imagine that the handling of the balancing elements (orcs, dragon and wizard) in a physical game will eat up a lot more time than some people will find they are good for.

Use minis from other games. We like the [GameID=10383] minis, and [GAmeID=8107] black Orcs.

It is different from games such as [GameID=98] and [GameID=181] in that (at the least) you only get one attack per turn, and you only ever roll a single die. And the Orcs regenerate, and the Dragon eats Men, and the Wizard flies around granting Peace and random assistance.

The 'goals' in this game are to recover your 3 missing Treasures - the board is typically in flux as you wade through Orcs, the Dragon, and other players' Men to your next target. Of course, the updated minis required updated Treasure tokens (see the Files section).

[old comment] Played Loooooong ago...

[8-2005] Played the game, was a blast! We used LOTR Risk figures, which improved things. A great time was had, even though I lost.

I like the chaotic Orcs and the computer-game-esque NPC challenge they provide. Makes the game world feel like it is alive and dangerous. This will see light of day now and again!

RATING: 7
A cleverly dicely designed, smoothly-playing old game that has some of the abstractness and mechanical inventiveness of more recent Euro fare. It's fun to watch each player's fortune wax and wane as her quest evolves, and fairly suspenseful during the endgame as one races toward one's last treasure. It's a mistake to go into this one expecting to have much time for strategy and tactics, though - so much of what happens on the board is out of everybody's control that the game sometimes feels a bit too much like it's playing itself.

Fantasy Risk.  (I know, I compare most strategy wargames to Risk, ...it's just my standard...  Cope. ^_^ )  Very balanced play mechanics and a capacity for up to 6 players.  The orcs usually suffer from an island-wide genocidal purge early-on, but they're fun while they last.  Taught my cousins this one before they could do long division.  I used to let them win, ...now I can't beat them, even when I'm trying!!!  ^_^

There's lots of interesting ideas here: best of all it manages to be one of those games where you never have enough resources to do everything you want.

Fantasy variant of RISK. Read plenty of reviews claiming it's more fun and underrated. Understand the underrating part because it's fantasy vs traditional war so will not be broadly accepted on mass market. 

The orcs seem to be an independent player (random AI) and the boat stuff is like Castle Risk. The rolling is simplified and I'm not sure that's a good thing. The randomness factor is high here. Really too high to consider this strategy in any real sense. I imagine this might have been fun when I was 10 and it would allow everyone to be on equal footing, but now not so much.

I used to play a lot with my neighbor when I was in high-school, and I think I must have given him my copy to payoff a bet of some sort, since I no longer have it, and wish I did. A nice light-ish game, with still lots of theme. A lot of Euro designs could take lessons from this game.

Simple yet satisfying.  Easy to teach and fun to play.  This one has some really clever aspects to it (i.e., Dragon gobbling and Wizard prosper phases).  I know there is a large amount of luck to this game, but good strategy still has a significant enough impact on the outcome to make this game a lot of fun.

Woo-hoo, Ducosim auction win of PRISTINE copy. Had a trial 2-player game, and it was a lot of fun.  An easy game to play, quite a lot of wild fate swings, but in a fun manner.  I made a big comeback after looking left for dead.  My son ought to enjoy this someday.  Have also played three player, and it was even better.  Why ever play Risk when this is available?

Rampaging Orcs? Check. Dragons eating people? Check. Random wizard? Check.
   The game play is just fantastic. Immediately players are set up against one another, and the random mechanic of the orcs gives a splendid change of pace from other Risk-esque games. My friends and I play it over Risk anytime.

Your reward for well outnumbering your opponent in battle? Getting most-to-all of them wiped out 9 times out of 10. It's one thing when the die rolls are crappy, but when it's part of the combat system itself??? That's when you have an utterly broken "game".

. A Fantasy Warfare game for the control of a magical island. 

I of course had a soundtrack of Dio, Black Sabbath and Aqualung going in the background.

It was not a bad game. It has your typical Risk battle feel but with a better battle system. The victory conditions are not based on world conquest but rather each person is searching for three treasures of their color (3 real treasure and one blank false one).

At the start of the game you give your treasure to your opponent and they place all four somewhere on the board. You do the same to their's.
So you are trying to fight your way through the island getting to your treasure and keep opponent from getting theirs.

However, the game itself plays against everybody. There are orcs that are seeded at the start of the game in random provinces and every turn they expand. When ever four orcs are in one province they frenzy and attack bordering provines till the player's armies die or they die (almost a pandemic feel). There is also a dragon that randomly travels the provinces every round, until he eats 1d6 of a random player's forces.

I certainly want to play this again. Clocks in at about an hour and fifteen minutes with two players. Turns go rather quick as you can only do one battle a turn.

I picked this game up from the goodwill knowing nothing about it.  It turned out to be a very good game.  It is a lot like any other land capturing game  but there are some random elements to the game.  These elements are what set it apart from most other conquering games.  If you find this game, get it, you'll be surprised like I was.

For a 70s game, it's pretty good. It's still a 70s game, with all that entails. It looks a bit like a war game at first glance, but it definitely is not. I think the game is best described as a combination of Risk, Pandemic, and a scavenger hunt.

The play moves pretty quickly, and it keeps you on your toes, but about half of the game is waiting to see how badly the orcs and dragon are going to kill you, what region the wizard is going to "lock" for the round, and just how bad off you're going to be when your turn finally rolls around.

I definitely did enjoy some elements of the game though. The random placement (the npc's A.I.) was pretty good for the era that this game was released, and the rolling for first player each round made the turns just that much more chaotic, which seemed to work in this game. You couldn't predict even one round in advance, because of the constant, major fluctuations to the board state, so quick, tactical thinking was crucial.

We've only played it with two players so far, but it seems it would be better with more.

RATING: 6
This is a good game.  With 2 players we called it "Risk With Orcs" but you don't get the "run over the whole board in one turn" effect.  Running around with a huge stack of troops does still seem like a viable strategy, until the dragon lands on it.  With 3 players, the board is much tighter with more orcs, more orc frenzy, and less player pieces.  

For a game of its age, especially coming from Avalon Hill, the rules are very well written.  

For a first play through it is quite feasible to sit down and read the rules step-by-step as you set up and play the game, instead of reading them ahead of time.

"Marnon" The game I played had no PeaceMaker Cards, but the game has been very good nevertheless - the deck might add random effects too much, now I think its balanced (we made a house rule to have 2 attacks per turn - but the second attack cannot be from an area conquered by the first attack) 

Now I finally have it again ("want in trade" worked) - and playing it again!

Essentially Risk with fantasy elements, however, where Risk-LotR feels broken compared to the original, this version actually works and I prefer it to the original. Lots of plays on this one, but if you play too many times in a row the game play can start to feel predicatable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The typical problems with games of this tyep: excessive time, excessive luck vs time spent ratio and some clunkiness detract from my want to play this game. However i was pleasantly surprised by the novelty and effectiveness of the combat mechanics, they worked surprisingly well and if used in a Risk or Axis/Allies type of setting would probably be a step up. There would have to be something done about the logistics of it all, i.e. some sort of way to provide a realistic way to vary the number of attacks one can make. The game does this aspect poorly, as you basically only get to attack one region, but you can make as many attacks as you want. This is a very awful design kludge in that it is both too much and not enuf. Which also ruins any attempts to create a coherent strategy in the game. So from a player stand point: no this is too long and too much luck, but from a creative stand point: this actually deserves some praise although does not go far enuf to push the strategy.

Fun multiplayer game. This almost qualifies as a "family game", with the right family of course.

Interesting take on the Risk system (orc frenzy!). Like the fantasy theme, and I also really enjoy the artwork on this one.

A fantasy-themed Risk type game with more flavor.  I played this a lot growing up, and always enjoyed those orc and dragon attacks.

RATING: 8
on replaying this game again after so many years, I am amazed at it combining a fast wargame; a wonderfully illustrated compact map; orcs that frenzy as their numbers grow; a rampaging dragon; all wrapped up in a strategic bit of genius. 
There are a few clunky rules and ideas, but it's fun!

Good game that draws in non gamers. Not too difficult to play. We always played with unlimited Orc production and that orc frenzies do not leave an orc behind. Makes the orcs much more powerful and feared.

Treasure-hunting mechanics are a bit unecessary, although they're there to prevent games from lasting forever.

RATING: 5
Like Risk, but not. I like the concept of the neutral Orcs that you have to overcome. They are actually a threat. I don't particularly like the battle resolution system though. The fact that a 6 is bad, but a 4 is good just messes with my head. The map is quite nice, I think they did a good job with it. The Wizard and Dragon random elements are also a fun part of the game.

I really like this game. An old favorite. It is fun, it is tense, it is a blast! Somehow I really like procedural games. It plays best with 4 or less players. One of the best old timers!

Another one of the first games I ever played that got me hooked on to Avalon Hill and the Fantasy Genre when I was a kid. An updated map and components would really help this title as it feels a bit dated.

Recently purchased this as part of a board game bundle.  Played with my brothers and really enjoyed playing!!

After several plays with two players, it's still good.  But takes about two hours to play.

I’m a massive fantasy fan and I’ve always fancied trying Risk, but haven’t crossed it off my ‘to do’ list yet, so when I saw this was billed as a fantasy version I was sold.  I just need to find someone to play it with now.

RATING: 5
Fantasy Risk with some interesting added mechanims, 3rd party Orcs rampaging, Wizard granting bonuses and Dragon swooping in to wipe out your forces.  A good game, but takes too long for me to get it to the table regularly  (Traded with Othello for Masons and Bausack/Bandu)

Feather-light fantasy romp that plays quite quickly.  There's a lot of luck in this one, but if you're looking for some trash talking with some fantasy fans, this game will definitely hit the spot.  The game moves along quite quickly, and there's just enough interesting here to keep people from being bored, and enough luck that nobody feels truly out of it.

RATING: 6
Very good light wargame. The fighting is similar but not exactly like Risk. You are trying to find 3 special treasures that belong to you. The others are doing the same. However, there are also orc tribes all over the board that are not controlled by any player, a dragon, and a wizard that mess with things.

In school I didn't play Risk -- I played Wizard's Quest. Beautiful board and for me a theme much more exciting than risk. More than one strategy was available too (large empire of precision strike team?  defend treasures yourself or bury them with orcs?)

Wizard's Quest has a high dose of luck with the dice & card draws, which I typically enjoy, but it doesn't feel like you can manage the luck well in this game. A good string of cards can let you march through & pick up all your treasures, or some bad die rolls with the orcs & dragon can decimate your armies with little chance to recover.

Maybe playing with minis will up the fun of a dragon attack!

This is a preliminary rating, based on playing with only two players. I want to try it with more, because I think the game will be more interesting.

Old school Fantasy game with some odd mechanics. It's fun and a decent challenge, but it's too slow and my group rarely finishes a game.

The low production values may turn off casual players. I love the Orc generation system though. I'm interested in hearing what modern games have built upon it.

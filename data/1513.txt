I think I like the thought of this more than I actually enjoy playing the game. I suspect the reason I don't reeally like it is because negotiation plays a large part of the game and it also seems there is an unstated requirement to play 'in character' and I really don't like that. Having said that, it is probably as a good a design as one could ever dream of in terms of how it places you right in the thick of the decisions a Roman Senator would have to make. Intrigue, politics, back stabbing and all.

Is there anythng more fun than backstabbing your friends? Never have I played a game with this fun politics involved. The mix of cooperative and competitive elements is yet to be achieved by any other game published so far. Every time you play will be a time to remember. Another one of my few classics.

Es un juegazo de negociaciones y tramas, con cierto desarrollo semicolaborativo, mil fases por turno, y muy largo y duro de aprender a jugar bien, aunque con tiempo y jugones, amantes de las tramas y la historia, se puede disfrutar de lo lindo. Está muy bien documentado y adaptado a las 3 etapas de la República. Una joya digna de los paladares más esquisitos que tienes que degustar poco a poco y con tiempo para sacarle todo su sabor.

Fun game of intrigue set during the expansion of Rome. you need to co-operate to start with or the system will win but in order to win the game you must ruthlessly stab your fellow senators at the right moment. The thing is they know it too and will be trying the same thing. Not a game  if you dislike confrontation and double dealing. Perfect if you do. My one criticism is the rules layout, far too complex and someone should have taken a strong development hand to weed out the unneccesary chaff such as minor resolutions (which have no game effect).

Grandísimo juego, que nos transportará a la vida senatorial de la antigua Roma.
Con el grupo adecuado, y si os gusta la historia (más concretamente la romana) puede ser una de las mejores experiencias que puedas tener delante de un juego de mesa. Muy buenos componentes, como pega, que necesites de 5 a 6 personas, y bastante tiempo para poder disfrutar a fondo de la experiencia.

Game is quite immersive and reminds about modern cooperatives, but has a lot more fiddly rules and is only semi-cooperative.

Game is nasty, lots of unpredicted setbacks (senator death, for instance), one needs to be able to welcome them and make the most out of it.

Very cut-throat game, with plenty of negotiation.

It's a great experience, but a hard seel for most players.

Republic of Rome is a 6 player, diplomacy game set in ancient Rome which spans more than 200 years of the republic from the Punic Wars to the assassination of Julius Caesar and the onset of the Empire. Players vie to control the Senate while also cooperating for the good of the state against Rome's enemies. It is this constant balancing act between personal advancement and the welfare of the state that that sets this game apart from ordinary games. If the players allow their personal goals to interfere too heavily with the republic's best interest, the people may revolt or the state may fall to foreign conquest and all players will be put to the sword. 

Be forewarned! This is not a war game in the traditional sense. It is a game of political intrigue with miltary overtones that literally oozes the rich detail of the period's history. Each player controls a faction of influential Senators vying for political power!

Expected playing time is about 4 - 5 hours.

The best game I ever played !!! Diplomacy, Rôle Play, Strategy, Treason, etc. Everything is done to get rid of your best friends ! 

This game is great and very complicated. The ennemies of Rome are numerous and powerful and they come to often ! For defeating them, you have to cooperate, and that is the problem, only one win, only one get the reward of the wars... so you can't let another player go to often in war ! In thoose conditions, how can we manage to make Rome survive (prosper is likely a dream) ? 

Most likely, we choose Rome death (defeat for all) instead of letting one player win the game...

I'm a huge fan of this game !

RATING: 10
Two thumbs up. A wonderful political/negotiating game where the theme matchs perfectly. You need to struggle against the "system" in the early republic scenario so it is much harder to play than the middle and late ones. While historically accurate, this might scare off some first-timers. Avalon Hill's rulebook is not so well organized (it thus have a glossary though, which many recent games don't) and is better to play with someone who "knows" the mechanics for the first time. Greatly recommended.

Backstabbing, cutthroating politicking, roman style - but take it too far and it's curtains for everyone. Very thematic game, even in the fact that its heart is the senate phase. That's essentially the time when you're actually playing, negociating and coalition building with the other players. The rest of the game is mainly throwing dice and looking up tables to see the resolution of the collective decisions, though it can provide plenty of tense moments.

Probably too much luck influenced for some: it's easy to see your plans brought low by a key senator dying at an inconvenient time. But, at least for the first era (which is the only one I've played so far), you should probably expect more to play for the experience than to win - and the fact the game oozes theme everywhere allows those who enjoy that to really appreciate it.

Wow, there is a lot going on in this game. A deeply thematic portrayal of the politics of the Roman republic this game packs a lot in. There are unhappy plebes to placate, foreign wars to fight and rival senators to out maneuver and perhaps even murder. Offices are bickered over, military commands are coveted and all is put to the vote. Everything can be bought.

Its all good if the initial hand of senators are even and people know what they're doing.

The problem is it falls apart if those things don't happen. If some players get all the good senators and others get the trash, then its very hard for the players with the crappy senators to get into a position of real power. Oh sure you can threaten to sink the republic if you don't get offices or something, but really, you have no money and little chance to do such things as lure other senators to your faction or win military glory etc.

Also it can go on for a very long time (in one game we got 2/3 of the way through the early Republic deck in 8 hours).

Oh and the rules could do with a weeding, they're a bit convoluted.

RATING: 10
This is my favorite epic game.  The theme is fantastic, the difficultly level is pretty brutal, and the Senate Phase at the heart of the game creates the best lightly-structured political environment I have seen in a game.  I would play this every weekend if my friends could stand it.

Now that I own the game and a bit more acquanted with it, a proper comment: 

For anyone, the first couple plays of this game SUCK. It feels like you have no decisions, and the game feels like book-keeping. 

After you have a solid handle on the rules however, it becomes nasty. At one point in the rulebook it states: "This is for people who find Diplomacy too tame." I wholly agree. 

Add in that I have actually had FUN playing this as solitaire, and this game is complete. You just have to get through those first couple plays and study study study the rules.

Még nem is játszottam vele, de már a legek játéka nekem sok szempontból:
1. Ez a legdrágább játékom eddig (20+)
2. Ennek volt a leghosszabb szabálya (az eredeti csak 30 oldal körül van, de a magyarban valami régebbit fordíthattak le, kb. 80 oldal!)
3. A legtöbb FÉLE lapka ehhez a játékomhoz van.
---
Végre kipróbálhattam! A legnehezebb szabályrendszerű játék az eddigiek közül, amit próbáltam. Veri a Here I Standet is, főleg hogy itt a készülést kicsit nehezítette a különböző kiadások különböző nyelvű szabályainak összefésülése. 
Sajnálom, hogy elrontottam a szabálymagyarázatot egy lényeges helyen, és a szavazást szinte végig rosszul csináltuk, mert egyébként egy nagyon alaposan kidolgozott, egyedi, a korabeli viszonyokat jól modellező, nagyon tematikus játékról van szó, ami ráadásul nagyon igényes is ebben a kiadásban. Bonyolultságához képest durván nagy a szerencse szerepe (bármikor meghalhat bármelyik szenátorunk...), de pont a témája miatt ez megbocsátható. A játék tele van nagyon jó ötletekkel (jók az egyes hivatalok, a halálozás, a haladó játék-beli per, és az egész kártyarendszer..., stb.), látszik hogy a szerzők teljsen szabadjára engedték a fantáziájukat, mert ahogy ők maguk írják is a szabályban, eredetileg le szerették volna modellezni ezt a 250 évet. Jól sikerült, és tényleg helyenként nem is annyira a játékon van a hangsúly, hanem azon hogy beleéljük magunkat abba a korba. Sok újrajátszási lehetőség van benne (a kezdővel is csak az 1. kor 1/3-áig jutottunk 4 óra alatt, szabály 2 óra volt), kérdés, hogy kinek van erre rendszeresen 1 napja...

I agree with Chris Farrel's main review. This is a great design, but here's my comment in reply.

I seem slow at RoR. Probably because we play infrequently. Early Republic game at 4 hours? Great. At 7 ... uh. 

2) A great experience game, but there is the potential to just nuke a player. My last game had two plagues (random events) in quick succession and two players lost all senators but one. Ugh. And then we had to go on for several more hours. 

A rare event, but after thinking about it, a fair number of my games had one (or more) players put out for several hours. So I sold my copy. I know its the journey, not destination ... but still.

Still, I'd rate it a six. Good design, but has practical issues. Now that it's been 5 years since my last game, I'd play again.... but I'd probably drop my rating afterwards.

A political simulation that relies on the players' understanding of balances to be a good game.It provides a dynamic system of threats and opportunities on which the players compete but also cooperate.It could still be a better game though.Rules are not that hard to comprehend as many people think.Theme is exactly the same as Hannibal:Rome vs Carthage.

This is the First Edition, the "non-glossy" one. Missing some chits. I don't like the game and will not play it. And I can't trade it. Just a dust-gatherer at this point. Actually, I have trashed it now. It's a "previously-owned" game.

RATING: 3
The random mortality chit draw is a game killer for me.  I'm not a big fan of spending 25 minutes negotiating to boost a particular senator and then having that very same senator die off the following turn.  

Unfortunately the entire 8-hour session annoyed me.  Rolling a 7 instead of getting a card is frustrating.  Spending talents (money) to improve a die roll, but still failing to obtain a knight is frustrating.  Spending talents to win an extra initiative, but drawing a war card is frustrating.  You get the point, or did you stop reading my dull comments a paragraph ago?

To wrap things up, the Republic of Rome fell from my "want to play" status to a 3 Rating on BGG.  I guess I shouldn't be suprised since I dislike negotiation games and randomness.

A strong initial first impression from one basic game won by me by rebelling and leading my legions against Rome. It did appear too easy though but I did have two loyal legions and rolled several 5-6 leaving Rome with 4 legions to my 5. It was unthematic that the Rome legions were not lead by one of the available Senators or the Rome Consul. That would have made the battle a closer affair. Need to check the rules for possible errors.

I'll probably rate this game higher when I've played it more often. The rules are Avalon Hill's best attempt ever at squeezing as much information as possible in a few pages. There is no real explanation of how the game works, just a summary of the rules. Still the setting is great, as are the many ways of playing the game. One real drawback is the random dying of senators, which can be too much of a deciding factor.

I love this game. And I love to make landbills, because the people love them and because my co-players hate me for making them. Early republic is "simple" to play, but it is so difficult beating the game if you cannot co-operate. Voting in The Senate is great fun also convicting your co-players for minor offenses is fun. I really love the mortality chit drawing: because eventhough you may have a Super Senator he may just die from a disease. Also controlling the masses to prevent mobviolence slaughtering the senators is fun. On the other hand provoking/trickering mob violence when you are weak is great fun. Especially if some of the stronger players get hurt. The game is best to play with 5 or 6 players!

I love it. It's difficult to found the right people to play with, and it's long. Anyway all the people I've teached has been seducted by the game. The main downside I've found is that you need the right group of people to play well with it. From a playing PoW is too much common and important the assasination ritual at the end of a match. Maybe historical, but having the game decided by a single dieroll sometime is tough.

Republic of Rome is an incredibly fun game, once players get into it, the roleplaying and bickering becomes very fun. Improves with multiple plays, as players are able to move past the clunky forum phase quicker and spend more time in the Senate arguing endlessly while Rome burns.

I'm a huge Roman history fan and I got the chance to play this several years ago. It's a lot like Diplomacy but with muc more chrome. It's best with as many five players but the game can easily last 6+ hours. Newbies will get frustrated learning the rules. For some, this game should be called "Roman lawyer" since they tend to argue about the rules rather too much. This game really needs to have a "gamesmaster" who keeps track of all the heavy accounting, decides on rules interpretation and generally attempts to keep the game moving along. At one point someone new in the game couldn't make a decision about which offer to accept because he didn't know who to trust!

In conveying historic atmosphere it has no equal and in deal-making and subterfuge it blows the Diplomacy out of the water.

Point me on the side of the haters... 

We played today for the fist time and I'm sad to say that this game doesn't work at all, a pity because the explanation looked promising... but I was punished twice (in the 4 turns that Rome survived) with a senator's death due to the awful chit drawn... And now, are you expecting that I'm going to organize some circus festival after all that bad luck to decrease Rome population's unrest and make the situation easier for the rest of the players? Really? But as if that wasn't enough, I got the Pope's character and the next event that happened made me pay a fortune to survive with him... I paid 30 T and all I got was the surviving of one worthless senator that entered in no votation at all... stupid pope.

After that, my only aspiration was praying for this game to end as soon as possible while the best situated players was distributing the leaderships posts growing on me a snowball paranoia. 

Thankfully the game ended soon because some of us felt tired of fighting with our naked hands against the strongest players and made nothing to prevent Rome's collapse. If not, I would rated this a "pain in the ass" 1 instead of a "not totally broken" 2.5

This is one of the biggest disappointments of my gaming life, maybe because I had big expectations.

IMO it is tough for newbies to get a handle on.  It is very clunky with dice tables and formulas and overlong for the amount of player decisions.  There is a lot of player interaction with experienced players, but negotiations for piddly concessions/prosecutions are tedious.  In the early Republic, you either lose (mostly), or give one player the game trying to save Rome.

Este juego simula el funcionamiento del senado en la república de roma. Cada jugador controla una facción de senadores, que deberan competir entre ellos por obtener mayor poder e influencia. Además, deben colaborar entre todos los jugadores para no ser vencidos por el juego.

Es un juego en el que la diversión está en las negociaciones y tramas entre los jugadores, al estilo de diplomacia. Tiene un reglamento espeso, pero bien jugado y tutorizado con alguien con experiencia es un juegazo como la copa de un pino.

Eso sí, la duración puede ser enorme (aunque tambien puede haber partidas de 20 minutos).

This is a fascinating concept. I love all the dealmaking and backstabbing with the permanent threat of Rome getting defeated. The rules of this are poorly written and pretty heavy. The main problem is, that once Rome survived the first era and stabilizes, during the second era things can become quite boring and it seems to drag on forever. It gets more interesting once you are in the third deck, when revolts become more likely, but to find people who have the energy to play that long is the real challenge. 
Still, I love the idea and enjoy big parts of the game, so it´s a seven...

Truly magnificent game!  3 player Early Republic game badly unbalanced though.  Our first games were very long as everyone argued about every stinking issue possible.  Once we played a few times and realized that it is absolutely necessary to attack the first Punic war on the first turn just to get a 50% chance of surviving the Early Republic scenario, things sped up considerably and an early republic scenario now takes one to two hours - one if the game kills us, two if it doesn't.  Playing the large scenario encompassing the early middle and late republic would be great, but if the early republic is survived, someone usually wins very early into the middle republic. I've never played starting in the middle or late republics and I really would like to. I had to lower my rating from a 10 to a 9 though for this game since since my friends learned Kremlin first and tend to play this game like they were playing Kremlin.  Small wonder Rome always falls.  Still, marvellous game but I think I will always prefer Traders of Genoa in the negotiation game genre.  I like RoR better than Quo Vadis however.

Very deep and thoughtful reconstruction of the Roman Republic in game form. Engaging historical details. But the tradeoff for the game's complexity is that it requires a very dedicated group with a good amount of time on their hands to pull it off. It's hard to find a setting that I can pull this out since the people that would be interested (my fellow historians and classicists) are all too busy to devote the better part of a weekend to learning and playing a game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Rating reduced to reflect the fact I would not want to play this again, despite how flavorful it is. 

This was the first and last semi-co-op game for me.  Made me realize the principle is fundamentally flawed.  Games should be either competitive or cooperative.  Semi-co-op doesn't work as a concept.  It was an interesting experiment, I just don't think everyone learned the lesson, since more semi-co-ops have been made since then, sadly. 

RoR is the ultimate vicious politics game - "designed for those who think Diplomacy is too tame" was the sentiment. In my experience the Mortality chits and assassinations played way too strong a role in the outcome. No good mechanic to keep losing players from letting Rome fall - unrealistic despite all the rules and chrome.  No fun to have a weak faction and have other players making all the decisions either, which means even if you couldn't make Rome fall if you were losing, it would still suck to be excluded from the ruling group the whole game.

There are solitaire rules as I recall, but I don't know what the point is of a solitaire game about deal-making and backstabbing. The mechanics of the game are primarily about money, prestige, popularity, etc. and the foreign stuff is very abstracted so I don't think it would be very fun to just try to keep Rome afloat solitaire.

Very good historical multi player.  One of the first games (if not the first) to be simultaneously cooperative and competitive.    Players must prevent Rome from falling to the Barbarians while aggrandizing their own factions.

Contrary to common belief, the rule book is not 'impossible to understand' as many have said, although it is dense.

The game definitely should be played with the full six players.  If you have enough time you should also try and take the basic game through the mid and late republics.

Reprinted recently by another publisher because it is a classic, and most certainly worth playing.

A little complicated but a great game. I love a theme of it. The mechanics is exceptional. It's the best when you add a little role-play to it and when playing with 5 players.
Republic of Rome simulates politics of Rome between first punic war and fall of the republic. You are a head of one of fractions in rome's senat. You must cooperate with other players in order to save the republic but in the same time you mustn't let any other player to grow in strenght too much. It's a real politics! Unfortunetaly this game last for minimum 3 hours so it's difficult to find time for it.

I changed rating to 8 because of too long game time. It's difficult to find gamemates because of that.

[UPDATE 1/2016]: Much as I adore 1830 and 18xx in general, I have to keep it 100 with chall: if I had a choice of any game with a bunch of enthusiastic players, Republic of Rome would be my choice. That has to mean something. That's why this is my #1 game. A friend of mine (for whom I'm pretty sure this is not their favorite game) said that whether you love it or hate it, there's no other game like it. True. And I love it.

:coffee: :what: :what: :) :) :D :D There are plenty of games about politics, but they are mostly games of international/geopolitical intrigue (Diplomacy, multi-player CDGs, Pax Britannica), or area-controlish games about election campaigns (1960, Die Macher), or screw-yer-neighbor games like Junta. I know of only one game that really conveys the feel of making laws and sausages, as the expression goes. RoR is an "experience" game. It would be best described as a thematic game if that wasn't a euphemism for "game with plastic minis and Yodas n' shit in 'em."

You can't go in with a fixed idea of the Plan you intend to pursue come hell or high water; this bad boy is negotiation first, tactics second, and strategy a distant third. This is not a zero-luck game for the 18xx/Imperial fans. (Of course, I am an 18xx/Imperial fan, and I love this game; I contain multitudes.)

The dice [i]will[/i] screw you. (They'll screw everyone else, too, but you won't remember that.) The foxes will have a ball, the hedgehogs will find themselves starting down the pointy end of the mortality chit draw.

And it's friggin' complex. Brutally complex. Old-skool Avalon Hill complex. None of yer sissypants Euro 4-page rule books here. (You may be reading this shortly after reading my comments praising the beautiful minimalism of Chicago Express and Maria -- like I said, multitudes.) I played this with a group of guys in college, all of whom (except me) went to law school or developed a serious drug problem or both. Not too bad compared to monster wargames, of course, and much much easier if you have a sensei to teach you instead of trying to work through the wall o' text rulebook by your lonesome, but if Power Grid is your upper bound of complexity, give this a wide berth. But if you like negotiation games, you have three to five friends who share that fetish, and you can set aside 4-5 hours for a game, accept no substitutes.

Best with 5, good with 4 or 6. The solitaire variant is somewhat fun but a pale shadow of the real game.

Hmmm amazing game with an amazing theme. I waited 20 yrs to play this game! Gives the feel of being part of the bickering Roman Senate, with a lot of brutal political backstabbing. It's hard to win either as a group for Rome or as your own Faction. It encourages players to get each others senators or gang up in groups, so much so that you could end up losing friends and making enemies. Lots of possible random factors and events add to the chaos. By the end though, you're sick of it and of all the voting and of each other and don't really care if Rome burns in flames!

Hmmm, only played once but it was not a great experience. It was not the complexity because I don't mind that and this one isn't really that complex anyway, especially if someone introduces you to the game. It has some strategy and very interesting diplomatic elements. The experienced group I played with assured me they really didn't play a smart game. We got trounced fairly early so perhaps I should reserve judgement but as of right now its a 4.

Besides not being my style of game, the very nature of the game is such that you can end up sitting out long and important parts with absolutely no ability to participate and that really set me off.

Absolutely amazing political/negotiation game. Plenty of opportunities for backstabbing and strengthening your position in the Senate (assassinations, prosecutions, forced governorships, etc.), which have to be kept fairly low in the beginning, since you don't want to end up losing the Punic or Macedonian wars nor facing the wrath of the Roman people. Downsides are the complexity, the length and that you'll need five or six really dedicated players for a game. If one or two persons aren't into the game, it's quite easy for them to screw the game for the rest. However, with the right group, this is simply a stunning experience. Highly recommended.

The theme is nice and it initially manages quite well to capture the atmosphere of Rome. Soon, however, you realize that this is the showcase of a game where the designers had a brainstorming about what would be cool to have in a Roman Republic simulator, and then put everything they wanted into the game mechanisms - never spending a second thought about whether a balanced and skillful game would result in the end.

Whoever put in the tags for this game that it is "Cooperative" needs to be taken by my Marian Legions to the city square and crucified.  This is one of the most evil, backbiting, nasty, and just down right VICIOUS games of politics ever made.  What makes it so great is that the BOARD (the game itself) wins about 50% plus of most games!! You HAVE to work together, even though there will be ONLY ONE who will Rule Rome.  The game is fiddly, yes.  Even I admit that there are several things that could be cut for the 'modern' audience.  This is not an 'elegant' game.  Its not a 'fair' game.  It is a game for people who LOVE politics, LOVE intrigue, and want their games to evoke an EXPERIENCE.  If you're looking for a process game, play Puerto Rico or Through the Ages.  If you're looking for a game where you FEEL that you Cornelius Sulla, bringing his legions into Rome for a final accounting against his political enemies, then this is the game for you.

El mejor juego que tengo en mi colección, una verdadera obra de arte.
Eso si, tienes que juntar un grupo de gente que sepa a lo que vaya, y que no le importe ser aniquilado por un juego brutal.
Si se consigue, y tienes MUCHO tiempo disponible... el mejor juego al que he jugado. No le pongo el 10 por lo que cuesta sacarlo a mesa, pero se lo merece.
Advertencia: El azar en este juego es BRUTAL. Mira que odio ese azar, pero la experiencia de juego que ofrece lo compensa con creces. En este juego, tienes que asumir que no vas a ganar, sino a disfrutar de una... no se como decirlo, partida. De una historia. Olvídate que es un juego, y se un romano. Salva Roma, o marcha sobre ella. Si se entra en la partida con ganas de ganar, vas a salir con muy mal sabor de boca. Lo importante, es conseguir meterte en el tema. En este aspecto, yo casi lo veo más un juego de rol que uno de mesa.

RATING: 7
A brilliant game! Really captures and simulates nearly everything from the birth of Rome until its decline. The rulebook makes it harder to learn than it is. It's really a great game with natural flow if you know all the rules. 

The best part of this game is the negotiation. This game takes best part of gamey and negotiation, making it seems like Cosmic Encounter with many other things to do. As always, gametime might be a long, but what can you say for epic and perfect game. Unfortunately the theme is Classical Rome.

It's easier to arrange a wedding, than to organise a full 6 player session of RoR. The rules are quite hard to learn and the system is very unforgiving. However, it is a very tense game to play. 
Two aspects make this game great:
1) the historic situation is very well represented in this game without getting too cumbersome. I really like the designer's notes of this game.
2) the balance between personal gain and cooperation is perfect.

There's a lot of dealings and backstabbing between players. Not a good game for hot-headed people though! I've seen people leaving the game because they couldn't cope with the "player-interaction". 
I love this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can't really make up my mind about this game... The "political" part of it is almost perfect, rules are well balanced except for the assassination rule... couldn't they think anything better than having 1 third chance of throwing away hours of strategy? The presence of a single dice randomness is really disturbing for me... 
MUST be played in no less than 5 (and when I say "MUST" it means that you should lower my rating by 3 otherwise).
[26/3/2007] After 2 more games I lowered the rating to 7. Like all "epic" length games, they should be played to their full extent... It's not a matter of "strategy" or "winning or losing", this is a game only to "play".

My first game of RoR should have been called "the extremely rapid fall of Rome".  Both Punic wars and the first Macedonian came out in the first turn along with a manpower shortage.  It went downhill from there and we lost a few turns later for having 4 wars in play.  That said, it was fun and I'm looking forward to trying again.

I played the first edition several times and it's an excellent political game. I've just recently played (and purchased) the new Valley Games edition, which looks very nice.

I recommend sticking with the early republic, though, as it forces a level of cooperation among players that isn't required in the middle or late republic.

I've only played by email.  But oh what a game!  If you are looking for a diplomatic game with lots of theme and chrome, look no further.  The rules are daunting at first, but once you have them under your belt...there are very few look-ups and the game isn't overly complex.  I'd rate this a 10, but I need to play it face-to-face first.  I'd imagine it loses a little ftf, as I think it may be somewhat fiddly and messy.  Also, deal-making games tend to shine via email.  Really curious to find out how it holds up.

Update: Finally got to play a 6er face-to-face.  I think I have it rated correctly at 9.  The deal making was definitely less than pbem, but it was a beginner's ER scenario.  May bump it up to a 10 if I ever get a chance to play MR or LR ftf.

Update: I hate to bring this game down from a 9 to an 8, but my gaming tastes have changed enough that this is no longer my style of game.  Brilliant game and design though...especially for its time.

RATING: 8
Players represent factions of Roman senators during various stages of the Republic.  Ultra dense game that plays surprisingly well once the rules are penetrated.  Players navigate their way through the chaos of an excellently tuned game system, as well as the political aspirations of their opponents to try and (a) keep the Republic of Rome afloat, and (b) win the game themselves.  The main key to it all is money, influence, popularity, loyalty and military standing - and nothing can be taken for granted.  Great game - amazing that something like this can be designed, and then developed down to such a finely tuned game.  Great thematic stuff, rating likely to rise.

Brutal, brutal game. The overly long, complex rule make this a hard game to play the first few times, but a delight when the players get the hang of it.

a slog to learn, but worth the effort it think. This is a coop game where your fighting against a card deck but with a catch. You are also competing for political power, so you can become Caesar.

I loved my first game of Republic of Rome!

I had heard very good things about Republic of Rome. I am very happy to had the chance of finally playing it.

Repubic of Rome is very unique as a board game in its own way. The players have to work together as a group or Rome will fall and everybody losses! It doesn't stop to have our own agendas and progress in own path during the game.

In all my games played, we saw the actually end of the game. Rome had fallen and we laugh very loud together. It was so funny all the bad luck we had. We lost all of our fleet at one point due to a card. Another card came out twice. The one which increases the cost of troops. First time out troops and fleet cause double the normal cost. The second time was three times the cost. OUCH! Talk about having money problems!

Never mind all the failed Assassin attempts and trails and senates killed! 
I want to play this game again soon. Republic of Rome is becoming my favorites board games.

Once I understood how the game worked, it was very easy to get in the game mood this game requires.

Another Avalon hill classic. Found a used french copy at the Valet garage sale for $20.

Can't wait to play Republic of Rome again.

*UPDATE*
Republic is my absolute favorite board game.

Own french Decartes and english Valley Games edition.

2016-01-17 : A political deal-making game just like Real Life (tm) - tons of flavor and I'm pretty glad I got the chance to experience it with a bunch of great guys. I liked it for the experience, but there's very little real long-term strategy in there. Sure, you can try, but luck plays such a huge part in this game that there's no such thing as long-term planning, which is a bit of a shame as sometimes you feel that you don't get to make that many decisions in a 6-hour game and that the game is playing you.

Absolutely brilliant game. Very few games achieve this level of interplay of theme, negotiation and planning. Just need to watch out for a couple of things though. The AH version had some ambiguities caused by the complex rules and house rules are needed to "even out" the Punic Wars in the early Republic period. But good to see a strong effort by VG and dedicated BGGers to improve an already fantastic game no matter its age. This is a classic.

There are two reasons why this is not graded as 10. The first is the game length which means it can be difficult to find play times. Secondly, players in my experience prefer to see Rome fall rather than see one player win. It can be very disappointing to see such a thematic game take a swift turn based on the actions of the players.

If it was shorter, and made up to modern games standards (iconization, semplifications of superfluos phases, and so on), I would give a 9 to this game. Treachery, discussions, politics, corruptions...it's like real politic, and really makes you feel to be a senator of Roman Republic. So my vote is high for this, but I would never play again this game unless I have really loooong time and really good and sporty players, and no better game to play. So it's 7.5 rating for me, but really if I watch it from a "contemporary" view, I would give it 5.5-6

[Political, Negotiation, Rome] {6P:9, 5P:8, 1P:4} Man, I still haven't put up any comments as I wanted to play this game a bit more, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards for a while. Let's see: this is bar none the best political, diplomatic and thematic game I've set eyes on. Its main weaknesses are its length and its difficulty (difficulty meaning Avalon Hillese fiddly rules). The rules can be daunting, but if you have someone who can grok Avalonhillese, they're not that bad. Lots of "third Sunday in the month of April under a full moon" rules, as usual, but if you miss an item here or there, it shouldn't impact the game much. Players take the roles of Roman Senate faction leaders, struggling for control of the Republic. The heart of the game is the Senate phase, where proposals are brought to the floor to be voted on by the Senators. These include offices, concessions (sources of income), persecutions (real fun) and practically anything else the players want to introduce. This is a riot if the players get into it and roleplay. The wars section of the game is mostly die-rolling, and takes the form of a cooperative/adversarial system that is hugely interesting. You want to Consul at war to succeed, keeping Rome safe, but you don't want him to be TOO successful such that he wins the adulation of the populace, the loyalty of his crack troops, and the ability to march on Rome itself. Accuse him of homosexuality or something, and persecute him down a notch. The admin parts of the game, including Senator mortality, can bog the whole thing down if you're not careful, so have some handy-dandy aids in place to speed through those parts. (Someone who's able to handle the rules can rune the admin in the background and keep the game churning.) I'd think that any gamer without an adverse reaction to diplomatic/negotiation games must give Republic of Rome a try at least once in his life. It's that fascinating. If only I could scare up a game as easily as I can for Puerto Rico... sigh.

Great game. 

You must create a faction in Rome and attempt to get your leader declared Emperor. You will backstab, exile, bribe and fight your way to supremacy (by gaining influence in the forum and popularity with the Mob) but will frequently have to cooperate with your rivals to fend off assaults by numerous enemies of Rome. 

The 'game' can and does win sometimes, if Rome falls. This fact creates yet more tension. The Forum becomes real as you furiously berate the leading faction for protecting it's own position whilst jeapardising Rome itself.

Downside - the rules are hard and it takes ages!

I believe there may be a 2009 reprint.

It is very demanding in terms of rule complexity (although that's far from the worse I've known) and clarity (there it's pretty bad) and in terms of playing time. But once you're past that, it's really an incredible experience, went completely differently each time we played and generated tens of great stories each time. Your senators take on a life of their own, senatorial debate is tense and incredibly engaging. And the base principle that everybody has to balance his own progress with safeguarding the republic as a whole is pure genius, and I've never seen it implemented so well elsewhere.We were blown away.

Had a first game with 4 players last sunday. Setup and learning the basic rules of play took quite some time since it was the first time. We only had time to complete 4 turns but I was impressed by how involved everyone got in the decisionmaking in the senate phase. We agreed that this will be played again when we get together for our next gaming session. I won't rate it after just playing a few turns but it sure feels promising.

RATING: 8
This is a fascinating game for anyone interested in the politics and intrigue of the period.  Players control factions and have to use influense in the Roman Senate to make things happen.  Fight wars, raise armies, throw games to please the mob, this game has it all.

What is interesting about the game is the way players have to work together AGAINST the game in order to try and win.

I have played many games where the players fail to grasp this one concept.  The key to winning in this game is to work with the other players so Rome isn't overwhelmed by wars it can't manage, while at the same time, managing your faction so you can ultimately win the game as an individual player.  For example, taking an army that you control that has been sent out by the Senate to march on Rome!

This is one of my favorite games as the system of play is unique, the physical quality is excellent and the topic is extremely interesting.  Now out of print, but worth tracking down.

There is a lot to like here. You really get a feeling that all the factions are bickering about personal advancement while the enemies of Rome are at the gates. At its core it is an enjoyable game. Unfortunately the rules are terrible and add so much unnecessarily complexity that it breaks the flow of the game and necessitates lots of rules checking and some boring periods of play.

One of the best games (taking the "experience" in consideration, not the games itself) I had ever played, RoR is a true gem. A semicooperative game in which the players try to gain personal fortune and power in the Senate. To do that they can assasin rival senators, seduce their wifes, send them to remote provinces as Governors keeping them far from the old Rome, but at the same time they have to cooperate each other in order to save the Republic from foreing powers or rebel senators cause if the Republic perishs all of them will be put to the sword. Interactive, with strategic and tactical options, beautiful components, this game is just a masterpiece and is twenty years old¡

I finally got the chance to play this, and the game was met with a rousing "eh."  I found the complexity completely undone by the large amount of luck involved in the game.  It just felt too much like a dicefest with lots of chrome.  In a short game I might have found that manageable, but for 4+ hours for a game that I felt was almost determined by luck at the end?  No, that's too much.  Pretty disappointing, to be honest.

Impressive game simulating politics within the Roman Senate, and one of very few negotiation games that I enjoy. There's great opportunity for many creative strategies, and the brilliant cooperative/competitive design gives a unique tension to the negotiations. Remarkable also in how well it conveys its theme.  Play it with exactly five players for the best experience.  Republic of Rome could probably benefit from some updating and streamlining, but it might be tricky to perform the surgery without slicing an artery.

I love this game. It simulates a subject of great interest to me and does it extremely well. Unfortunately, its rating does come down because of its complexity, length and poorly organised rulebook. It's not for the thin-skinned and not all of my friends like it. It's a game of diplomacy, negotiation and deception and played purely against its mechanics it fails miserably, which means it needs to be played with people keyed to that. All of which which means opportunities to play it are rare...although it's a gaming experience and one or two sessions a year are enough to justify me owning it.

Wheels within wheels within wheels. So there is some good stuff, most notably the theme and the politicking. To get there, though, you need to deal with three things (which, when taken together, are deal-breakers); a) the obtuse rules that are desperately in need of a redesign, b) the bad rules that are just arbitrary (the bad auction stuff, the weird turn order nonsense, etc.), and c) the incredibly wild swings of luck.

Joc semicooperatiu de simulació política i diplomacia amb puteig i molt temàtic. El joc inclou diversos escenaris (desde la República dels inicis fins a gairebé la seva caiguda) que canvien la forma de jugar, que pot ser més cooperativa o més competitiva.

L'atzar pot ser decisiu, hi han tirades de daus constanment, però li dona molta emoció al joc sense restar estrategia, ja que l'important és la teva posició al Senat en front de la resta de jugadors.
La dificultad del Escenari de la "República Temprana" és molt elevat, resulta complicat defensar la República de totes les agresions que pateix.
Té una duració molt elevada, de unes 5 hores jugant a un escenari de una sola época.

Actualització després de més partides: realment, l'atzar de les fitxes de mort és molt decisiu, especialment si es dona sempre en el mateix jugador. A més, totes les partides acaben sent molt similars (especialment a la República Temprana). Hi han algunes cartes que estan molt descompensades (com Sabotaje o Seducción) i que sempre es guarden per fer intents de influencia el últim torn... Tot i que el sistema de votacions, discussió, etc... está molt ben dissenyat, al final resulta molt farragós i cansat. El vaig agafar amb moltes ganes però cada día em fa més mandra jugar-hi, per duració abans prefereixo fer un TtA, un TI3 o un Runewars...

An endless festival of randomness and fiddliness that pretends to simulate Imperial Rome through a neverending succession of events and die rolls. 

The only reason that I can find for its surprisingly broad appeal is the understandable human need to justify the burdensome effort of coping with such a dreadful and complex-for-no-good-reason rulebook and the waste of time of playing a game that can languish for hours.:D

IMHO it miserably fails both as a balanced game or a credible simulation.

Tried to play this F2F years ago and it didn't really work with my crowd. Have since been playing a couple of games via PBEM and it works really well. Very difficult game to get your head around in terms of what you can or could do and how best to influence events to aid your own faction whilst also keeping everyone else down. Perhaps the best political influence game out there!

Have recently found a group of dedicated players who are up to playing this F2F in the local area. Latest game on the 4th had five players and as ever the game system brought us down by the end of turn 4 when the First Punic War with Hannibal and Hamilicar in command, The First Macedonian War with Philip V in command and Syrian War with Antiochus and the Gallic War were all left as active wars by the endu of the turn. This was by far the most co-operative game of RoR I have played, we did everything we could to keep Rome afloat but the die rolls were brutal to us. Great game, can't wait to play again.

Latest play, six player affair using the Mid-Republic deck. Very little war action this time but loads of in-fighting and political interplay. Still only made it until end of turn 3 without a result this time due to lack of time. Once again fantastic play and great gaming experience just too long a game....still love it o bits though!

I've not the patience anymore to play games where I have to re-read tons of rules every time I play.  Too bad, since the theme is great, the cooperation and cuttroath mix is really nice.

Unlike Archipelago, the players here have a real incentive to cooperate, and the whole war thing make much more sense than giving pineapples to calm down the natives.

The Balance of "Spear and Shield" in this game is perfect, Will you give all the legion for a Consul to fight a critial battle than in return he revolted and matched back to Rome and claim Victory, if not, 3 un-managed wars will force all players to be loser, and the game designer win.

By the way, Rome can stand-up in the middle of Mediterranian Sea, it has been killed 2 great enemies Carthage, and Greek. Even all players promised WON'T revolt for a personal win, it is hard to match to 2nd age of the game.

No scipios, I don't know how to win Hannibal and Hasdrubal with 1st and 2nd Punic War on the table. If you got that Scipios red card, you will give to the player with #1 faction controled??

RATING: 6
Based on one play (early Republic, 6 players). I can see the potential in this game but its not as precise or smooth as the games I prefer playing. I'm not talking about chrome when I say that. I mean things like: in our game a player lost his two of three senators in the first two turns due to unlucky mortality chit draws. He's pretty hosed at that point, has close to zero chance of winning, and so his incentive structure changes: sabotaging Rome at every turn makes just as much sense as anything else.

Another player had one Senator assassinated and a second sent to War (and stuck as Proconsul), leaving 1 vote in Rome. That's an entire Senate phase of doing nothing for that player.

Those kind of situations feel like they can crop up a little too easily in a game of this length: it's not much fun for those sidelined players.

It also feels like it requires players in the right mindset: in our game players clearly had a stabby-gamey approach. We had heaps of (unnecessary IMHO) assassinations, which then begat revenge assassinations. During the Consul for Life voting several people voted in favor of it (maybe they just wanted the game to end?) even though it meant they lost.

I don't mind that kind of silliness in the right setting but RoR is just too damn long for that, I felt. If the game is over in an hour or 90 minutes that can even be fun. But four hours in?

It also feels like it suffers from the same problems that can affect Battlestar Galactica: unless someone keeps on top of things the game can drag. This manifested in three ways:

- One, the Forum phase, which should be over in a minute tops most of the time, takes far longer. Players dawdle over their choices, take extra seconds rolling for events, etc. No one player takes THAT long but an extra 15 seconds here and 30 seconds there and suddenly the Forum phase has taken 5+ minutes.

- Two, the Rome phase can stretch to eternity unless the Presiding Magistrate keeps on top of things. In our game the PM would get distracted, we'd lose the train of thought, etc. This is a delicate balancing act since this is, really, the heart of the game. But you still need to keep it productive and focused.

- Three, as mentioned above it feels like it requires the "right" group (and the "right" number of players) much more than many other games.

I'm still interested to give it another go to see how my concerns above pan out after a few more plays.

================

A second play (also Early Rome). I doubt I could be convinced to play this game again. Above I mentioned Battlestar Galactica and my second play made me think of it even more. The core mechanics of this game are thin: take out the interpersonal diplomacy stuff and there's not a lot there. Maybe that's not fair, since that's the heart of the game. Here's the problem: I feel like I'm in a meeting at work. I feel like this takes everything potentially horrible about cooperative games and stretches it into a 6 hour marathon. I don't like 6-hour meetings at work.

I am unconvinced there is enough scope for actual game play here. One person is randomly determined to be the initial HRAO, which gives them a huge initial influence boost. Another person happens to have the personality that is good against the current Active War. In our game there were three players that I felt had no chance of ever winning the game. It just doesn't feel like there is enough stuff happening for players to control the outcome the way I think you should be able to in a 6-hour game. Consider for instance, the difference between someone who rolls a 7 and triggers an event and someone who doesn't and draws the Shipbuilding concession. There is simply no in-game mechanism to balance that out, which makes it feel like the entire game devolves to luck and metagaming.

To me, this is an "experience game" where you go along for "the ride".

Lots of nice ideas, options and mechanics. But after three or four attempts. The last couple played purely cooperatively. We have NEVER had Rome survive more than about three or four rounds.

Great game! It's not that complicated after you played the game a few times and IMO, it is still unsurpassed as a political game! Highly recommended, if political games work for group! Not that cheap, but I guess that will get worse over time. If you don't like it, you will be able to sell it wothout a great loss.

Update Oct 2015: This game ultimately didn't work for my group. I can see it function very well for certain groups, but if it doesn't, the investment for getting the rules right IMO isn't worth it.

This is definitely the most complex game I own, but the good news is that it is playable with people that don't know every single little rule as long as at least one person does, and can guide the others along. Also, this game is only for those who can handle a lot of player interaction, persuasion, and conflict.

It can last five or more hours, but the key is to keep negotiations moving along, and for people to know when they just aren't going to get their way this time.

This game has so much for and against it.  To me I felt like I was playing Munchkin for a really long time.  There were some really great bits.  I liked the voting on things, and how to people went of to govern provinces and many of the intrigues and wars that were fought.  But since external pressures weren't ever a problem, people could just use their votes to kill whoever was approaching 21 influnce points or if it came down to it, try to murder him.

Endless?  Maybe.

RATING: 8
Still a unique example of a semi-cooperative political/negotiation game, but the combination of grossly over-complex rules with the extreme arbitraryness of the mortality chit draw doesn't sit well in the modern environment. This is simply crying out for a Euro makeover, which should it ever happen will leave the original swiftly forgotten.

Flows much better than other games of a similar style due to the low number of special cases requiring their own rules. The luck factor felt fairly high, but overall not a bad choice for a multi-player game lasting a few hours.

PG: Around 10

One of the few games I will rate a 10!  Many different compnents come together in a game that feels like your faction is vying for control of Rome while keeping those pesky barbarians at bay.  This game has it all, assassinations, forced govenerships, blackmail, bloody gladitorial games and military coups, not to mention a very fickle Roman population!  We have played this 10+ times and it was always fun.  The main complaint with Republic of Rome is the fact that there is a strong "playing against the game aspect".  That is, there is a very good chance that the game will beat it's players, and nobody wins.  However, I think that this threat is essential to this game, otherwise it would quickly degenerate into nothing but assassinations and the like. It emphasizes the need to put aside petty squabbles for the good of Rome.  Also, their are three different scenerios which offer different types of games and levels of complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Need to think more about this one. A great recreation of aspects of Republican politics, but the assassination rules are perhaps too arbitrary, unhistorical and need some tweaking (although the game I'm basing this on may have been anomalous in this respect).

Played through almost all of the Early Republic scenario (almost certainly would have ended on the next round).

This was certainly a roller coaster ride of a game, with wonderful swings of fortune that turned the game on its head with startling regularity.  It certainly took awhile to understand the flow of the game and figure everything out (and this on the "easy" game) but I can see myself wanting to play the full experience (finding the time though? maybe not so much...).

This game takes a long time.  The first time we played it, we played on three successive Tuesdays.  We left the game set out on a table and didn't disturb it.  The ending was quite a blitz as most of the players had a chance to win.  One player assassinated her way into victory.   Forming an alliance with someone you can trust (until the very end, that is) is key to winning the game.

EPIC and ULTIMATE historical game.

In an ideal world every historical game should be like RoR: rich, complex, deep, full of details, true to the history and having almost RPG character.  Here you can REALLY feel like a Roman senator handling the affairs of the empire...

But all comes with a price.  And the price is high here.  An enormous entry barrier for beginners (full explanation of rules would take several hours) and huge playing time (I estimate 2 full days for proper climatic game with no shortcuts). 
 Had I had time and had I known people with that much of time and dedication, I would've played it regularly.  In real life - PASS.

The other issue - players who don't do well can deliberately sink Rome and cause all players to lose.

It's been a long time since I've been part of a group which really wanted to get into this game.  A pity because it can be such a fun experience in the right mood.  Usually bad luck with epidemics keeps a player or two out of contention, which can reduce fun factor.  If the group is in the right spirit of negotiation then being out of contention doesn't completely kill the fun, but it takes the right group to redeem the game for such a player.

One of my seminal board gaming experiences was an 18-hour session of RoR which stretched from the Early into the Late Republic.  Oh, to have a summer break again.

If you and 2-3 friends have a day to spend, and you like deep strategy/negotiation games, this is a winner. The game takes a lot of time to complete, though, and at times the mechanics can provide surprise turns of fortune (death chits especially).

I'm conflicted.  If I had rated RoR ten years ago, I'd have given it a ten.  Nowadays, its rough edges are showing.  The rules are a little overly-fiddly, and a new, updated edtion would probably be amazing.  Luck plays maybe too much of a role here...one player in my game lost almost every single senator he had to mortality pulls.  He had no chance at all to win.  Diplomacy had a simillar feel but is an easier game.  Werewolf has a simillar feel too, with a much shorter play time.  Get someone to teach you if you haven't played, that really helps.

Oh goodie, a 4+ hour quasi-cooperative game. I know that people love their theme but to watch players lose senators to death because a little chit was pulled out of a cup was just too much for me. If that's really going to happen can't we play the game in a shorter time frame? Painful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I spent a week studying the rules to this game, but still when we came to the senate phase it was like walking through a bog trying to understand how everything fit together. Even with our confusion in full effect, we still found it easy to get into the spirit of the deal-making, backstabbing chaos of the senate floor. Alliances and payoffs are short-lived and change vote to vote.  It was a little unclear to us what was fair game for buying votes (can you give a commission already attached to a senator? Can you pay money from both faction and senate treasuries? Are knights fair game?). It might be in the rules somewhere, but it was not apparent to me.

The complexity of the game is both its strength and weakness. I think a few things could be streamlined without losing much in play and I hope Valley Games is able to produce a more readable rule set. I like what they did with Titan, so my hopes are high. What the game gets right is the balance players must find in cooperatively protecting and strengthening Rome while also selfishly working to raise the influence of their own factions in the senate. There are nice character touches throughout the game, such as the State of the Republic address, which essentially just a dice roll, but as a player how can you not actually speak to the rabble in the hopes of raising the prospects of your faction without causing a rioting mob of malcontents rampaging the senate and killing any senator they can grab a hold of. Republic is a heavy negotiation game with a lot of character. Players who enjoy long, complex games, negotiation and voting, and a bit of role-playing will find a lot to like here.

RATING: 6
Semi-coop where everyone can lose but only one person can win. Republic of Rome includes a "mortality" phase in which your influential senators can die without warning, dramatically changing your score and relative position. This turns it into a bit of a roller-coaster ride in which players have to reassess the situation each round. Today's leader is tomorrow's non-entity. In a way, this is one of the game's features, because you have to clear the slate to an extent and stay on your toes as far as making the best decisions. Although admittedly, it can feel like the game comes down to who is on the upswing when the clock stops, which in turn means that players have to hold back a couple of 11th hour shenanigans. 

Interesting game.

Buying this game was probably a mistake.  I have spent some time reading the rulebook and watching how to play videos but this just feels like a monster to learn/teach and will require a large group, some of whom are familiar with the game hopefully, and a full weekend day to play it in.  That happens maybe once a year.  I've tried a mock playthrough and couldn't get through one round after realizing how important the negotiating/diplomacy part of the game was.  The components are very nice and much improved from the older version.  The game doesn't fit in the box which annoys me.  I'll hold onto this one for now but I can see this being a trade or sale in a year or two without a single play.

Played once with 5p in 7hours. Although crunchy, didn't seem too difficult. Barely controlled chaos. Flopped 1st and 2nd Punic wars. Were repeatedly forced to fight and win a war or be eliminated by four wars. Treasury went down to one gold during a disaster (again nearly ending the game). Game was great until the last turn when everyone not winning tried to assassinate the person who was... which was against the rules. I'm willing to play a 7hour game but the vast majority aren't.

This game is tough to rate. I love the theme, and I love that it simulates the whole political process. 

However I hate almoste every single mechanic in the game, especially, disasters and stand-offs. They FORCE you to use that one statesman. If he's at the bottom of the deck, you're hosed. If any other Punic war comes up in the first turn (an apparently inevitable event based on my 4 playings) you're hosed. In fact, in my four playings, I have yet to either finish a game or win it.

Wow- very hard to compare this to anything else I have played. I tend to play a lot of lighter fare (Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, etc.), so this is nothing like anything else I have played. I don't know that it is a good game, but it sure was a fun one the 1 time I played it. I am not cut out for the negotiation aspect of it, and ended up blowing the game by letting myself be talked in and out of things, which must be fatal every game. I had a great time- loved the tension between cooperation and competition. But the next day, I have a nagging feeling that it won't be the same feeling if we play again- like when you like a dish so much so you make it again the next day, or when, as a kid, a pick-up baseball or football game is so much fun and you all agree to play again the next day. That next day is always a let-down, and feels forced. Is that how a 2nd game of this would go? I am not really sure how to rate this. It was an OK game, but a great experience. Would I play it again? Will I have the time? That's the question...

I found this game painfully tedious to play. I felt like I was playing an accountant rather than a Senator. 

I remember being way behind in the senate, so being bored to near tears I declared an attack on Rome or such... a few die rolls later my perplexed opponents declared I had won. 

I guess I need to have a game with actual units or something on a game board with things to blow up rather than just a bunch of charts....

Rating to 2 from 3 just because I see so many people playing it and I just don't get it!

I like some elements and concepts in this game. In particular, I think it is cool that the players are competing with each other but need to cooperate to avoid having everyone lose to the game. However, the VERY long play time combined with high complexity, heavy negotiation & backstabbing, and wild swings of fate (due to luck & chaos) make this game a brutal experience for me.

As a simulation exercise, or as a teaching tool, Republic of Rome is excellent. If you're interested in classic Rome you must experience it, hands down. But as a game? I'll stay away from it, thank you very much.

PLUS
Fantastyczna symulacja polityki i władzy, zarządzania personalnego (senatorzy, członkowie partii), finansowego (dochody partyjne i indywidualne, wydatki na własną popularność i pożytek Rzymu) i wojskowego (którego konsula wysłać na którą wojnę, ile otrzyma armii, można mu ufać, że je odda zanim przekroczy Rubikon?), rozgrywek dyplomatycznych (ty głosuj za moim senatorem na konsula, ja zagłosuje w obronie twojego senatora w rozprawie prawnej) i historii Rzymskiej Republiki (z prawdziwymi wydarzeniami i osobami). Cały czas toczy się walka o przetrwanie Rzymu (w innym razie wszyscy przegrywają partię) a także o zdobycie jak największej władzy dla samego siebie. Czuje się jeden z błędów demokracji: dylemat polityków biorących w niej udział gospodarować na dobro narodu czy do własnej kieszeni...
MINUS
Za dużo różnych reguł na wyjątki, bez których mogłaby być krótsza.
SUMA
Po prostu: moja ulubiona.

PLUS
Outstanding simulation of politics and power, managing of people (senators, faction members), finances (faction and individual income, popularity spending and expenses on state maintenance) and military (which consul to assign to which war with how many armies, and can he be trusted to return all of them before crossing the Rubicon?), diplomacy (vote for my senator to become consul and I'll vote in favor of your senator during his prosecution) and the history of the Republic of Rome (with real events and persons). The whole time you struggle for the Republic to survive (otherwise all players lose) as well as to gain the most power for yourself. One of democracy's flaws becomes tangible: politicians' dilemma to work in favor of the state or for their own benefit...
MINUS
Too many exception rules without which the game could be shorter.

Not as complex as I initially thought; the myriad rules and exceptions made this game far too much of a slog to enjoy on my first try, but the second and third play was enjoyable. Seems dated for a 1990 game, but fantastically detailed and historically flavoured.

Pre-ordered.  I heart you, VG!

Update: I was actually in the game at BGG.CON 09, the first play on the new printing, in which it was discovered that there were no "0" markers, so I got to hear the phone call delivering the bad news.  Since then my preorder copy has shown up, and it looks [b]great![/b]  I think I'll need to make some player aid cards, since the one included isn't quite what I want... and although I'm sure I can get my friends to try this [i]once,[/i] I'm a little worried about getting them to play it a second time.  Maybe it gets faster once you know what you're doing, but I'm a little worried that our first game will be 90% accounting, 10% actually playing, and that that will turn everyone off.

...

What I'd love to see is the original design, described in the "The Making of Republic of Rome" section of the rulebook:

[q="Robert Haines"]We played three games that first night. Each game took between an hour and ninety minutes to finish. [...] Our gaming group played Senate on and off over about five years, usually as the last game of the evening to fill a short time slot.[/q]
What came out the other end of the Avalon Hill sausage works is a game you have to schedule an afternoon for.

Also from that section: "I suggested the solution might be to hire ADULTS to do the playtesting. As you might imagine, this was not the answer they were looking for, and from this point on, I was out of the development loop."

You control one of the powerful factions of the Roman Senate.  But, that's not enough.  You must be the most powerful.  Vye with your opposing factions' influence by sending their Senators off to remote governships or to lead wars.  Vote on everything.  Don't get too caught up on the battles on the Senate floor, though, as the barbarian hordes will overrun Rome if you're not paying attention.

Another game where you really need a group of players that all "get it" to make it worthwhile.  The rules organization is IMO a disaster -- they are effectively written backwards, so that essentially never do you see a term defined before you encounter it in another rule.

Very interesting game that recreates some of the feelings of what it might have felt like to be a member of the Roman senate.  As a Latin teacher and a lifelong gamer, this was a game I had to experience and that I enjoy despite its chrome-laden fiddly ruleset which would normally not be something I admire.  The swingy nature of various aspects of the game make it both a brain burner and a chaotic affair.  Unique game that cannot really be easily rated along with other games. Scenarios played -- Early, Middle and Late Republic.

RATING: 9
Treachery game in the Roman Senate.  I hope I could have found the people who have the same interest in playing this game out.  A complex negotiation game though. A contrary to the common belief that game using cards is a simple one.  This is definitely not. A good site discussion on the game can be found here: http://www.spotlightongames.com/playback/ror0.html 

The game system itself is actually not that complex.  You want your faction grows in terms of power, influences, popularity and after all, wealth while you cooperate with other factions to defeat the Rome's enemies - there is no shortage of it. At the same time, you won't trust the Senator who brings the troops to the foreign provinces without restrictions.  Too few a troop, the war would be lost.  Too powerful troop vested in one man, he might become a rebel and win the game by returning to Rome as the Dictator. 

This Active - Inactive - Imminent War mechanism is the most exciting thing in the game, setting the background stage to the Roman politics.  I played this game once and fell in love with it at once.  

The is the perfect game I have seen about he Roman Republic.  All aspects of the politics are covered. I love the game. The new edition even has solitaire rules, thus always playable alone.  Without the negotiation part, it might be less fun but watching the history and development of Rome like a movie right in front of your eyes are spectacular too.  Highly recommended for anyone who has an interest in the history of the Republic of Rome, or Imperial Rome, depending on who to see it and when to see it.   

I have the AH edition and I haven't made up my mind whether to get the new VG edition too after 3 plays.  The new map is certainly the one reason I should buy the new edition!  But at times I don't like the wheel things in the new edition because the rounds inside the clip clashes each other when you move the rounds - accidentally changing the numbers on the other wheels. After all, Republic of Rome is truly the best political game I ever experienced!

Dropping from 8 to 6. The more I play this, the less I'm thrilled about it. The amount of work required to slog through the game is very high for the amount of enjoyment it brings. The management is also quite awkward for a quasi-boardgame: there's a ton of counters floating around just to keep track of a few parameters. A better experience in PBEM, really. Only for die-hards.

Another old AH monster come back to life. Takes quite the investment in time, and it can be very frustrating to get beaten by the game due to a bad draw of event cards (2 punic wars and no Scipius Africanus will spell disaster quickly)

The main appeal for me is the balancing of helping yourself or helping the republic. One surprising fact: Nice guys don't always finish last! - but then again if they win, they probably weren't all that nice in the first place.

Length of play is a bit of an issue. You need dedicated players and to keep bickering to a minimum
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very complex game (hence the 8.5/10 rating) but well worth the investment in both money and time. Nowhere else will you find a game so perfect as a political simulation, even more so for the Roman Republic. Not for casual gamer but a must have for any politico/scheming player.

RATING: 6.8
A very nice, extremely long game of politics.  Though it’s clearly very closely based on the Roman Republic, many of the game’s mechanics make it seem much like modern politics.  It’s both fun to play and a good simulation — But it takes so very long, and the rules are so obtuse, that I may never play it again.

I have only played this game by e-mail since it is next to impossible to find 5 other dedicated players within a 30 miles radius!
As far as I am concerned it is a fantastic game of deception, politics and diplomacy with enough historical flavour to make it real fun. I understand that random events can be somewhat destabilising but, eh, that's life for us all : It is all about making the best of the cards we are given.
I will not give it a 10 simply because the sheer dedication it takes to learn the rules means the game never hits the table. Otherwise it would be perfect;-)

One of the few old Avalon Hill games that actually hold up well.  The game is incredibly complex with a lot of exceptions but it really does simulate the political dynamics of the Roman Republic.  Not everything is historically accurate but it much of it is very close.  I really love the Senate phase and the voting.  The game is highly asymmetric and is self balancing in that you want to keep everyone in the game.  If you do not, no one will win.  

It can take 6 hours to play, but unlike Dune or Civilization, it always moves forward and you don't feel like you are doing the same thing over and over.  

Along with 1830 and Merchant of Venus, this is one of the great AH titles.

When I purchased the reprint of [i]The Republic of Rome[/i], my board gaming circle consisted of seven players - four men and three women. A couple of us were serious gamers, but the women had barely progressed beyond "gateway" games. Nevertheless, I just had to have this game - it just oozed too much theme.   Since then, the guys played it a few times (and got in a bit of trouble over the long hours it's kept them from their lovely wives) so it's been a wee bit poisonous in our little group. Now my group is smaller so it's unlikely to get played any time soon.

Amazing game, that pits players against each other in a vicious political areana, but also forces them to co-operate to ensure Rome survives. A brilliant concept that I'm surprised no-one has copied.
The excess chrome could be shaved off, but the basic game isn't that complicated.
A knife fight in a phone booth on the edge of a cliff!

Update: A recent play of this didn't go down as well as I remember.  The good stuff is definitely in there, but so is lots of needless chrome, bookkeeping and general fiddlyness.  The first-timers I taught it to felt it needed major simplification and streamlining to be considered playable by modern standards, and I reluctantly agree.

[Played once - AH edition]
The game relies entirely on diplomacy (plus double crossing, backstabbing,...) and random effects (cards, dice).
The premise (competion between the player and occasional cooperation against the game) is good, but the game is simply an outdated product of another age.
Very long.
Massive and poorly written rulebook (a dreadful combination).

The most immersive, emotional and fun game of all; what the players decide or vote, how they behave toward each other, everything counts. The most enjoyable point of this game is that it allows you to do endless things. It's about politics, after all, and that's what makes the game shining: the emotional factor. You can convice the others to vote or support you, and then betray them. Or you can make the others don't see you as a threat, and instead judge another senator and execute him. Or send him to a war. And it has a right sense of Roman history. For a history lover, it is even more enjoyable. The only flaws are the length (more than 5 hours ruling Rome may be exhausting), the big amount of rules and the optimal number of players, which prevents it being more played as it would deserve.

Δυστυχώς υπάρχουν πολλά πράγματα που δεν είδα, από σενάρια μέχρι κανόνες, οπότε δεν μπορούμε να πω ότι έχω ολοκληρωμένη άποψη, αλλά δεν μπορώ να αφιερώσω κι άλλο χρόνο στο παιχνίδι.

[b]Θέμα 5 / 80[/b]
Η συμμετοχή στην Σύγκλητο στην απαρχή της Ρωμαϊκης αυτοκρατορίας, η αντιμετώπιση πολέμων και προβλημάτων και οι προσωπικές φιλοδοξίες για άνοδο στα αξιώματα είναι ένα πολύ ενδιαφέρον θέμα. [b](9)[/b]

[b]Components / Artwork 6 / 80[/b]
Η Valley φημίζεται για τα εκπληκτικά της remake. Στο συγκεκριμένο έχει κάνει ίσως την καλυτερη γραφιστική δουλειά αν και δεν είμαι τόσο οπαδός της computerized αισθητικής. Ωραία αν και φαίνονται ευθραυστα τα treasuries και οι επαρχίες με τα ροδελάκια τους. Λίγο τα tokens μου φάνηκαν old school αλλά ΟΚ μικρό το κακό. Λάθη στο board που χρειάζονται paste-ups! [b](8)[/b]

[b]Rulebook 4 / 80[/b]
Εντυπωσιακό εκ πρώτης όψης αλλά δύσκολο στην ανάγνωση, χωρίς παραδείγματα και γραφήματα. Στα συν οι ιστορικές αναφορές και οι designer's notes. [b](6.5)[/b]

[b]Fun 25 / 80[/b]
Γενικά είναι ευχάριστο παιχνίδι. Υπάρχουν αποφάσεις που πρέπει να παρθούν από την ομάδα για το καλό της Ρώμης, αλλά πάντα σκέφτεσαι και το προσωπικό σου συμφέρον. Μπορούν να γίνουν τρελά σκηνικά (ελπίζω να τα περιγράψει ο sakal σε session review του). Σε μεταφέρει καλά στο κλιμα της εποχής και σε βάζει στους ρόλους. Τα πράγματα μπορούν να έρθουν όμως πολύ άσχημα για κάποιον από την μια στιγμή στην άλλη και να ξενερώσει. Το παιχνίδι κορυφώνεται στον τελευταίο γύρο αν η Ρώμη φαίνεται ότι θα αντέξει τα προβλήματα της. [b](7)[/b]

[b]Πρωτοτυπία 5 /80[/b]
Δεν έχω μεγάλη εμπειρία (για να μην πω μηδαμινή) για παιχνίδια πριν το 1990 οπότε και βγήκε, αλλά από τα εκατοντάδες σύγχρονα που έχω παίξει δεν μοιάζει με κάποιο. Είναι κάτι διαφορετικό απ'οτι έχω παίξει. Την εποχή που ανήκει την δείχνει κυρίως από τους πολλούς πίνακες που καθορίζουν αποτελέσματα μετά από ζαριές. Σαν συνολικό gameplay όμως είναι ξεχωριστή εμπειρία. [b](8)[/b]

[b]Μηχανισμοί 22 / 80[/b]
Το παιχνίδι έχει πολλή τύχη. Δεν με πειράζει προσωπικά αλλά μπορούν να καούν άσχημα παίκτες. Π.χ. έτυχε να έχω τον καλύτερο πολιτικό από την αρχή και τον τουμπάνιασα πανεύκολα. Και άλλος να τον είχε όμως το ίδιο θα κατάφερνε χωρίς κόπο. Την ίδια ώρα, άλλοι συμπαίκτες πάλευαν με πολύ κόπο να ανεβάσουν τους δικούς τους. Ανά πάσα στιγμή κάποιος καλός πολιτικός μπορεί να εξαφανιστεί. Μια ζαριά μπορεί να καθορίσει επίσης τον νικητή στο τέλος, αν και πιστέυω ότι παιχνίδι σαν αυτό πρέπει να το βλέπεις πιο χαλαρά και να μην σ'ενδιαφέρει τόσο η νίκη. Κάτι άλλο που δεν μου άρεσε ήταν ότι στο γύρο του ο κάθε παίκτης δεν μπορεί να κάνει σχεδόν τίποτα, κι αν κάνει θα εξαρτηθεί πιθανότατα πάλι από το ζάρι! Άντε να παίξεις καμιά, κάρτα να πάρεις κανα ιππότη ή να φέρεις με το μέρος σου άλλο πολιτικό. Το δυνατό σημείο του παιχνιδιού είναι ότι οι μηχανισμοί είναι έτσι στημένοι ώστε να σε μεταφέρουν σ'εκείνην την εποχή με τον καλύτερο τρόπο. Η συνεργασία των παικτών για να αντιμετωπίσουν τους κινδύνους είναι όλα τα λεφτά. [b](6)[/b]

[b]Διάρκεια 6 / 80[/b]
8 ώρες για παρτίδα 5 άτομων είναι πολλές για να τις αφιερώσω ξανά, όταν έχω τόσα παιχνίδια που σε 4-5 ώρες νιώθω ότι μου προσφέρουν πολύ περισσότερα. Δύσκολα θα το ξανάπαιζα λόγω διάρκειας, ακόμα κι αν πιστεύω ότι μπορει να βγει σε 5-6 ώρες. [b](2)[/b]

[b]Replayability 7 /80[/b]
Για μια παρέα που είναι αποφασισμένη να αφιερώνει κάθε Κυριακή τής στο παιχνίδι αυτό, το replayability είναι αρκετά μεγάλο. 3 σενάρια, μεγάλη τυχαιότητα στα events και σε οτιδήποτε άλλο γίνεται, δολοπλοκίες. προδοσίες κλπ. Αντικειμενικά δεν μπορώ να του βάλω χαμηλό βαθμό υπό την προϋπόθεση που ανέφερα, Ποιος μπορεί να το κάνει στην πράξη δεν ξέρω. (8.5)

Easily my favorite game.  It transitions very well from cooperative (when Rome is starting out, and you must all band together to protect it from foreign wars) to competitive (when one senator gets too powerful and must be taken down a notch or perhaps assassinated).  The secret deals, alliances, plotting, voting and prosecuting of fellow players are all a tremendous amount of fun. There is little to no downtime in the game -- you're never just sitting around waiting for someone else to finish his turn.  Plays best with 5, and one turn up for auction. 

I would never turn down a game of Rome. Now if only it was easier to get a group  together to play the game.

An epic, 15-hour game played over the July 4th weekend, 2006 reaffirmed my ranking of this game.  With the right group, this is the best game ever.

I just could not get into this game at all.  Due to the ability of the game to "win", you really need players who don't make their mission to help the game.  Disruptive players can really take the fun out of it.

The rules in the re-print addition are also pretty bad.  There are many holes and sentences that just don't make any sense.  I really would have thought that these sorts of things would have been ironed out in a reprint.

I never understood the rules. Maybe it's not good to play with only 2 players. However it's long ago I played it. 

We are planning to try it again ... the living rules may clear some things. Besides everybody here says it's a great game ... I hope I will enjoy it too. And it seems it is quite a valuable game (80 Euros???)

I have heard there will be a new version, hopefully the rules become available so I can play the old game again with understanding them.

I've played 2 (one learning) games of this now in the first phase of the Republic. The first terminated, as expected, when our 3 hours ran out. The second took 6 1/2 to get to the bottom of the first deck... and there are 2 further decks to go!

Whilst I'm pretty happy to play anything just so long as I'm playing, I'd only play again because it was what the others in my group wanted. I do not 'get' the game and have no intention of so doing. For me, it's much too complicated for what it delivers and for its timescale, especially the political elements which I did not understand, meaning I was far too easy to persuade when it came to assigning office or concessions. Admittedly, I'd made little effort to get up to speed with the rules due to other priorities, but I don't really want to either. It doesn't feel worth the investment. This tilts very much toward simulation rather than game for me.

Others in my group clearly love this sort of thing because it was described as 'engaging'. I would perhaps go as far as 'diverting'. That's about as polite as I can manage. Not a game for me.

By putting you in Rome's Senate and not at the head of her legions, "Republic of Rome" offers a unique perpective and gameplay.  That perspective encourages a megalomania and cruelty tempered only by the threat of the barbarian hordes.  A game that can destroy friendships -- name another where you can put other players on trial or exile them!  Fascinating, historical, rich in unusual gameplay, and deep.  Only the complex rules and length knock it down from a 10.

RATING: 7
Having played both face to face and via email a few times, I think it's a game best suited face to face.

A lot of conniving in the game, so if you're up for a play, don't be gentle. At some point, you will have to face down your enemies (which is everyone else at some point in the game), so throw them out to the wilds (I mean provinces) while you secure your powerbase making deals to suit your goals.

The deal making in the game is one of perception, if you can make the other person think they've done well in a deal, then, even if from your perspective they've done just as you wanted, you're on your way to victory.

Always a blast.  It's hard to get a political game that actually feels like politics, but this one gets it right.  There are enough things to trade, and things to worry about, that you get real nuance and variety.  It doesn't immediately turn into "let's you and me make an alliance against the world" or "let's all gang up on the leader" (the latter can happen at the end.)  The fact that everyone must fight to keep the Republic afloat is a stroke of  genius, and makes the rest of the system tick.  That challenge might be too severe in the early game, but better that than too small.  After a play or two you take the threat to Rome very seriously.  

The rules may never be completely clear but it's a game of negotiation, so you can work it out.  The two-player and solitaire rules have some vagueness (or rigidity!) about persuasion attempts, and especially about the choice of military plan.

This is one of my alltime favorites. Have played the game countless times, both competitively and as a form of (almost) live roleplay. The game works best when the players adopt the roles of roman senators and conduct the diplomacy in character. These gaems can take upwards 12 hours to complete, even when playing early republic, but at conclusion it does not matter if you won or not, you always feel that you have been involved in a great gaming experience.

GREAT game, hard to find opponents willing to get creamed while they learn the rules.  A great political game , but requires some effort to learn from scratch, but not impossible.  The Early Republic scenario is a killer.  Finally survived one, and went on to win BIG, but the game took a LONG time.  Loved every minute of it.  Best negotiation game around.

Jun '16: Still unique for what the game offers.  negotiation, cooperation, dissent, bribery, thievery, selfishness and selflessness.  All in one box.

This game is so awesome. I've played it twice and I want to keep playing it as much as possible.  It is like the best elements of Diplomacy and Battlestar Galactica rolled into one (with the "traitor" mechanic being the personal choice of over-ambitious Senators rather than a secret, random card draw).  I feel like it completely captures the feel of being a power hungry politician.

One of the best games I have ever played (possibly biased due to my interests in classical history). Nathan owned a copy, and we had a few games.

Brilliant and unique (but complex and long)!
It is a very special experience of living a democracy in a war cenary. If you read "The first man in Rome", you understand when i say it is just like the book. You must be a good politician, orator and military commander (and not only) to win the game. You must work with your fellow citizens to defend Rome but you must also defend your personnal objectives. Contradictory  and provocative in the best possible way.

This must rank as one of the great immersive simulation games of all time.

RATING: 9
Birthday gift 2010 from the wife!!!

After slogging through the mire that is the rulebook, along with the online sources provided here (that definitely assist in clarity) I finally got this to the table in an epic, four-player, early Republic scenario, six hour dagger fest. It was, without a doubt, one of the nastiest, and yet most engaging, gaming experiences I've ever had. Indeed, our game ended in some eerily similar ways to the fall of Caesar. A player used his Tribune to call a referendum declaring himself Consul for Life, a last-ditch attempt at assassination was made, and in this case if failed spectacularly. The assassin found himself brought before the court and put to death for his crimes against the Republic. And the Consul for Life made it to the end of the turn without triggering any of the game loss conditions. It was well and truly epic. Thematically, it genuinely felt as if we had all spent the last six hours NOT in ancient Rome per se, but in point of fact in Washington D.C. I found myself pushing for pre-mature entry into foreign wars (call it Bush doctrine pre-emptive strike if you prefer), simply because I had the Armaments and Fleets concessions and would receive massive kick-backs on the building of legions and fleets. And that was one of the many many examples of the grotesque thematic similarities between this game, allegedly a simulation of Rome, and our very own political system.

But, the real magic of this game is that it simultaneously generates crisis situation that demand players to cooperate, but individually rewards specific single players nudging them closer to victory. In that sense, it seem to sit on the gladius' edge between a cooperative game like Pandemic, LOTR, Ghost Stories, etc, and a competitive negotiation game as nasty, ruthless, cut-throat, and underhanded as Intrigue or Diplomacy. In that sense its relation to semi-coop games like BSG or Shadows is also apparent - not that there is a traitor mechanic where one player is explicitly told he is trying to undermine the attempts of the others to manage the game crises, but something far, far more disruptive and terrible: all players are essentially incentivized via the game mechanics to make agreements or take actions that only benefit themselves, and in that sense, ANY player during a given round could be the traitor. This "shifting" traitor element makes things volatile and intense--indeed, for at least one player in our play group, the chaos, unpredictability, and constant shifting of allegiances made him feel frustrated with the game. For me, it was something magical - the same type of nasty, backstabbing bullsh** I see in my daily life, abstracted into a set of board game mechanics. 

Indeed, I would argue that this game is an even more accurate depiction of human interaction than Diplomacy because it includes the cooperative element in a different way. In Diplomacy, I only cooperate for personal gain or benefit. In RoR I can just as easily be persuaded to cooperate as often as not simply to prevent losing, even if such cooperation will not necessarily facilitate personal gain.

So this is not a game for everybody. Indeed, I would imagine this is a game for very very few. The rules are worse than the U.S. tax code. There is layer-upon-layer of complicated theme-specific chrome. The real game is played in the Senate phase with the negotiations and deal-making, which means if you are an introverted wood-fondling Euro-gamer who dislikes shouting, threats, intimidation, name-calling, backstabbing, kingmaking, bribery, lies, and general nastiness, you will feel bullied and frustrated for most of the game (and I suspect at least one player at our table did.) But if you can tolerate these few flaws, and the negotiation bit is making you feel all sexy, than this game will seem like a masterpiece. The only thing keeping me from rating it higher is that I know there is a finite group of people who I will ever get to play it with, and it's game length means it will have to be specially scheduled in order to even see the table again. Still, when it does... phew. What a game.

===================

Second play confirms - just so much damn fun, and much of the subtlety reveals itself this time. Timing seems far more important that I realized during my first play, and it also is now important how essential it is to watch the influence being gained by the other players.

Can't wait to move on to the middle era and late era scenarios and to eventually try an all-day/all-night game involving early, middle, and late scenarios all in one sit down!

The rules don't seem as complicated as people make them out to be, but they definitely make the game seem incredibly dull and highly random. I have issues with a game like Eclipse because every step in the game has some random element, but at least there you're constantly making key decisions about your little space empire. Here, it's just randomness to build the "experience," and the decisions you make seem be nearly inconsequential. As others have said before, the core of the game is in the Senate phase, when players discuss laws to institute, decide who to send off to war, etc., but this seemed hardly more complicated than Diplomacy. Indeed, the designers of this game claimed to want to make a game that basically put Diplomacy on steroids. Unfortunately, most of what they added was just piles of cards, chits, tables, and other randomizing elements rather than new mechanisms to create more meaningful decisions. I have no interest in playing this game and would almost certainly turn down an invitation to play it.

Hail to the King, baby. Well, the emperor, maybe, or the dictator is better suited for this game, but the meaning is that: this is the best political game ever released, and I doubt it will ever get better than this. Tehre are some little problems with assassination in my experience, but there are house rules to solve this problem... and if you exclude that you get a roman political simulator that it is so much fun and so much involving, you'll end up feeling you are really in the senate. It is THAT good.

Players act as Roman senators to manage Rome, fight wars, distribute spoils of office. Novelty in this game is that everyone can lose if Rome is not managed properly. However, spend 2 hours building up a senator, watch him die in a random draw of a chit, protect yourself from being manipulated by other players, 3 hours later, there is still no resolution and this is supposed to be fun? I got dragged into this game by people who played it many years ago and I think it brought up fond memories for them (sort of like Kingmaker), but perhaps not having intimate knowledge of the game, and having people tell me certain things were fair (and knowing they were not fair) just doesn't do anything for me as a game. On the plus side, this game added "Die Swine!" to my vocabulary.

Cutthroat strategy game for 1-6 players.

And since it's a historical simulation, you can actually base decisions on common sense (which is not possible in abstract Euros).

I've determined that the semi-cooperative genre is one of my favorites because of the psychological underpinning -- not knowing who to trust is a wonderful mechanic.  Add this game to the pile, although the mechanic isn't exactly the same.

I dock this game a little due to its length; you won't be getting through this in a breezy 3 hours.  Plan your weekend accordingly.  You won't regret the decision, but plan an additional hour to whatever you think the game will take.  Our last game went over 8 hours, and we only made it halfway through the Middle Republic after flying through the Early Rep unscathed.

Also, as the kids say, "Beware the Ides of March."  At some point in the game, the game's flow will shift from "everyone save Rome, we're in this together" to "we're safe now, so here come the knives".  With BSG, you're at least assured that someone WILL go against you, and that decision is decided by the game as opposed to your new backstabby buddy.  Here, everything is more... fluid.  If you're unimpressed with direct conflict and a little bit of heavy-handed negotiations and/or betrayals, go elsewhere.

Gioco lunghissimo e molto complesso. Difficile trovare il tempo per fare una partita e spesso quando si programma non si riesce a portarla a termine, già un ottimo risultato è finire la prima era (di tre). Gioco di diplomazia dove si dovrà simulare il Senato dell'Antica Roma con tanto di morti per anzianità, tradimenti, assassini e complotti. Un giocone, ma come detto, quasi ingiocabile. Dopo ogni partita mi dico che non ci giocherò più perché a tratti è frustrante per lentezza, fortuna, imprevedibilità, ma di fatto il gioco è più un'esperienza che una battaglia strategica. Oltre al tiro dei dadi e alla pesca molto viene fatto dall'aspetto strategico.

Wheeling and dealing in the violent politics of ancient Rome.  The game is about bribes, negotiation, voting, proposals, law, government, Roman history, war, assassinations and using circumstances to your advantage!  Lots of interaction between players and downtime is minimal.

Epic game which takes several hours to complete  - especially if playing the Middle or Late Republic Scenarios.  Plan on setting aside a good 5 hours for the Early Republic, 8 or more for the Middle/Late.  For those of us with families, finding the time to play this can be challenging.

The metagame is the game - if you don't like table talk, then this is NOT for you.

Very good "American" game, it gives you the feeling of really be a senator in Rome. Rules are very long and contorted, but they are obvious once you play the game.

RATING: 5
Only played the early republic so caveats apply. For the rookie, the game is just one big level-out exercise. In effects points are handed out by popular decree - nearly everything is voted on. As a result, any move to hand points to someone in the lead is voted down. Any move to to hand points to someone trailing is voted up. And because there's no hidden information, it's not a particularly interesting exercise in perceptions either. Horribly random things then happen which in an instant send someone from first to last ... but it's all ok because then they'll be voted up when points are being handed out, getting them back in the game. It's interesting watching the history of Rome pan out via the cards (much like a CDG does with early, mid and late decks) with a backdrop of senate decisions and voting on how to process the cards. Apart from voting yay or nay, your main contribution to the game is arguing who should be getting points and who not, and how big the army should be to go off a fight wars. The game isn't about making lots of decisions on your own behalf like most games provide, it's a talk-fest. So the question is, do I really want to do that for hour after hour? Not really. Interesting once; don't need to repeat. And the rules are truly, truly horrible.

This game does have a lot to  as there are a lot of rules specific to events and actions that only come up once in a while. You must play together in order not to lose, but look out for yourself at the same time. Alliances are formed and if you are close to winning, you can get killed. Playing only one of the three eras is enough in my opinion as the game can be frustrating at times and if you are a new player, be patient as strategy is not at all obvious.

One of the most influencial games I have ever bought and I played this a lot in 1993-98. However when played at conventions three players would always gang up together to rule Rome leaving me and newbies out in the cold doing nothing for hours. I started making my own variants in 1996 and a sequal Empire of Rome in 1998. This turned into a monster (image the admin for 50 senators and 50 provinces), but in 2008 I realised mthat I had not played ROR for ten years and I sold it. It was lost in the post and I had to refund the buyer.

Ok - I admit that this high rating is purely subjective. This game for certain has it's flaws - it's lenghs, some produktion issues (though most of the components are really great, esp. the coins), the luck factor...etc.

But nontheless I was thrilled since I first catched a glimpse of it and the very first game already didn't disappoint me. Even my gaming group, which normally avoids any kind of intrigue or backstabbing, went well along with it. If you are and/or know classical philologists, archaeologists, historians, historically interested people or just gamers who need a good, far vacation from euro-boredom - this is the game for you!

RATING: 5
TRY Jan/12 - played 6er, early era.  I would rate this as a game of political bickering and virtually random role assignments based on lucky draws or the need to keep particular senators from getting too powerful.  I don't mind negotiating games, but you don't seem to have enough negotiating tools available to make it meaningful (my opinion only).

Assassinations seemed unlikely to succeed, as did attempted bribery to have senators swap factions.  While I liked how dice were incorporated, it seemed that luck heavily overrode planning.

I do agree that it is a neat design, and just isn't my style.

Incredibly heavy, complex, rich, involved, dense game, in which basically everything has to be decided by majority vote. Many options, negotiations, and screwing people over. A unique cooperative/competitive feel, which is to say it's the most competitive game you'll ever play.

I do seriously dislike the randomness, especially in the setup card draw. If you start the game with only a third of the income of another player, the lowest number of votes, and your only military competent senator dies of a heart attack before the game even starts, you won't be making many meaningful decisions for the next 5+ hours.

Sadly an old game that is just too much of a good thing. It lacks the clever insights that became the hallmark of the Euro-explosion. Just too plodding with several subroutines that I think could be abbreviated or excised altogether. It also plays far too long.

An outstanding negotiation/diplomacy game, very thematic - you want interaction look no further.
  
In the role of Roman Senators you are trying to enhance your faction's power, and if that requires taking others down a notch or two - so be it. Most actions must be voted on by the Senate which leads to a good mix of wheeling an dealing. Even things such as prosecutions - rely on how well you feel about the results. 
If you don't like the results there is always assassination succeed of fail it will be painful.

Yes Rome needs to win it wars, so the consuls must succeed - but you don't want them to succeed so well that faction can march on Rome.

RATING: 3.1
I can't tell whether this simulation of history was intended as a role-playing game, a purely strategic competition game, or a cooperation game, but whichever way it was meant, it failed.  You're supposed to control various senators in the Roman Senate as they try to make the right decisions to keep the Roman Empire from collapsing (which makes all the players lose together), while keeping their political opponents from gaining too much popularity and/or influence (which are confusingly not the same thing and have very different sources and effects) and/or gaining enough loyal troops to successfully lead a revolt.  The game is replete with options, and has a turn/phase order 'summary' longer than a dictator's enemies list, but most of the things you can do, or HAVE to do, seem to make very little difference to anything.  Sure, you collect money, but it doesn't seem to matter anyway. Sure, you CAN spend some to get another knight, so you can make more money and have another vote, but it hardly matters. Sure, you CAN bid some money to get another turn (unless you roll bad), but usually a turn has no effect on you personally. Sure, you CAN 'sponsor games' to reduce unrest, but it's usually 0 anyway.  Sure, you CAN 'veto' a proposal - and the next almost identical proposal, and the next, until you run out of cards anyway. Sure, you CAN vote against a land bill, like THAT will ever happen in a hundred games played. Sure, you CAN try to steal someone else's senator -- with less than 0 chance unless you've been Consul or something. Sure, you can 'prosecute' someone, but that's just fiddling around to undo the effects of previous positions they've held.  The way wars were run was terrible - draw a card and a war starts - with a 'strength' given on the card - roll 3 dice, avoid rolling certain values, and the war is over. What fun. Role playing a senate trying to figure out how best to suppress this uprising or repel that invasion boils down to "if we wait, there's another card in the deck that will make that war double strength, but this one only has a leader card..." What fun. Build up some power on a senator, someone pulls a token from a cup at random, and it's all gone. What fun. Role-playing whether to have a dictator or not boils down to whether the leadership points would matter compared to the war strength points, or not. What fun.  Or not.

Revised rating down. Still a masterpiece of a simulation, and one-of-a-kind gameplay. But unless you play frequently (twice a year, I'd estimate), you'll get bogged down in frequent rules look-ups. And both the AH edition and the Valley Games edition have very frustrating rule books.

========================================== 

Everything a historical game should be, as well as the best negotiation game going. This IS the desperate and ruthless struggle for political supremacy in the Roman republic. The deal-making is rich and cunning, without devolving into hard computation. And the game perfectly models the challenges and stresses the growing empire places on the republic. 

I used to think it could benefit from a streamlining, but I've come appreciate the texture and tremendous narrative value of all the sub-systems and thematic chrome.

--Jun2007-- Played once in 1990.  Rather complex; immersive; memorable.  Really a fascinating game.  And just found a perfect copy on eBay...

--Jun2009-- But didn't play until now.  It's still quite cool.  But I hadn't quite remembered how random it was.  Maybe it was one of those _enhanced by the passage of time_ things, but I fear while my current rating is still positive it's not quite so enthusiastic as once it was.

Great game! With the possible exception of Diplomacy, no other game encourages player interaction and provokes heated discussions like this one. There is NO downtime, everybody's always involved and cold-blooded vengeance is always lurking around. I've seen people cry playing this game!!! It's important not to take it personnally... Only problem is the last turn, where you can encounter the dreaded kingmaker issue with the use of assassins.

Dripping with theme - so much so that it's almost a roleplaying game. Engrosses you in every aspect with a high level of player interaction. Although the rules are a handful, there's enough helpful aids to be found that'll really smooth out learning the game. If you like Roman history then you must play this game!

-------------------
So, I got to play this again recently (Feb 2011), and it really needs to be looked at as a game you play for the experience. There's a heck of a lot of luck with the drawing of mortality chits literally wiping players out of contention. I always thought you need to spread your influence out between a couple of Senators to protect yourself from an unlucky mortality chit draw or assassination, but it's hard to go up against other players risking it all by investing all in one Senator and getting away with it.

It seems to me there would be one simple fix to cut down play time. A one minute timer to discuss Senate phase appointments, etc, followed by a simultaneous blind vote. Sure you'd lose a bit of the subtly, but a minute saved here and there turns the game into an evening affair instead of a dedicated day requirement.

The rules seem unnecessarily fiddly. A fair bit of streamlining could have been done to create a more accessible base game. The way it stands you're really only going to get good value out of this if you've played it in the last six months (so the rules are fresh in your mind), and your mindset is that you're in it for the ride.

Down a notch, but as a fan of Roman history it's still one I'd like to experience a few times a year.

Goodness. Dunno how they decided on "240 minutes" as the playing time for this game - perhaps if only the early republic deck was used, all the players knew the game, and none of them were too inclined to argue...or I guess if you factored in that half the time Rome burns fairly early on due to the players failing to co-operate...personally I've never had less than an emotion drenched 8-15hr shitfight of a game of RoR. I haven't played in over a decade - most of my friends swore off it after one too many frustrating losses that came down to one or two rolls of the dice after hours of pain and anguish. But a few have recently started to get nostalgia about playing it again so who knows? :-) I think I actually managed to win the last couple of games I played of this, which got me picked on in other games for years afterwards because you have to be really (a) good, (b) sneaky and (c) evil to have a chance of winning this game. Oh and of course it helps if you've played a few times before, but IIRC Icehawk demonstrated that being sufficiently good, sneaky, and evil would get you a long way without prior experience. 

The main reason I don't rate it higher is that the rules are WAY too long and convoluted. I'm pretty sure every game we played we realised we'd got something wrong. But we had fun every time anyway.

Played three times: one 2er, one 4er and a solo. All the times it was a wonderfull adventure, but I think you need more than 4 to fully enjoy this game. It's an experience game so don't go sour if you lose. The game can take as long as 6-8 hours to complete and that's only because we have lost 2 times and in my solo the auto-player was named Consul for life towards the end of the first era. I can imagine a full game of all thre era's reaching into the 10 or more hours spot.

A superb game of Machiavellian politics. Unfortunately it is difficult to teach to new players and it takes one turn too long on average for our short time. Overall it is definitely worth the effort. Also, the rulebook of this game is epic. It is by far the closest approximation of a legal document that you will find in games. That is not a good thing. On the whole, as long as you have someone who knows the rules, this game is great.

I liken reading the rules to this to playing Call of Cthulu.  Everytime you finish a page you should roll a sanity check.  It is like reading computer code for a game and trying to imagine what playing it would be like.  My brain was drizzling out my ears.

BUT, once you get it the game actually runs quite smoothly.  I think it is genius.  So rich in theme, great interaction, high levels of tension, and lots of tough little decisions.  After playing this you really can look back at where you made mistakes and learn from them.  Still though lots of random elements, serious kingmaking, steep learning curve, tons of tables, cheap components and an outright cluttered mess of a board prevent me from giving it a ten.  This game is screaming for an update.  As of right now, perhaps because it is so much a simulation,  it is more an experience rather than a game.  But what an incredible experience.  Not for the sensitive or a player that is not willing to commit to the spirit of the game.

After almost 12 months of planning, could we eventually sit down a whole day to play Republic of Rome. We had talked about this game in more than a year and the theme - antic Rome - combine with both collaboration, intrigues and a bit of role playing, was right down my alley. The game flow was too slow in the beginning, the first turn took almost 90 minutes and ended with - Rome at the brink of ruin. We draw four war cards the first turn, the first was the 2:nd Punic war, with activated the 1:st. As we precipitated the problems with having both Punic wars active at the same time, so one of my senators - maybe Fuvius? - became dictator and took all our fleets and legions to battle the 1:st. After much rejoicing when we thought that we had defeated the enemy fleet, they sprung upon us and turned the table to a disaster (rolled 13, we all looked at the table and read victory, smiled, patted our backs, and then, after maybe a minute the rule book guy said - "oh no, it seems that it is a disaster"). The first two mortality chits drawn was the dictator and the master of horse. The next card to make an appearance was Hannibal... Time for lunch.
After the lunch break the game flow was quicker, but Rome was not really save able. We never came to any cut throat action as the game gave us a headache with all the problems. When we at last had the money to combat the Macedonians who also was on the rise, we had a manpower shortage due to the unrest that kept rising despite our gladiator games. In short, we blow it, or the cards, the dice and the mortality chits blow it for us. The game never became anything more than a brutal fight for survival that seemed impossible in the long run. I can see that with a better start and a possible to build some sort of foundation in your fraction the game could become more tense and not just a display of hopelessness/helplessness. 
At the end of the summer we might give it another go, and I think that we then will have some red wine to swallow your defeats with and make the game dress code toga .

Although I've only played it one time this is a very original, tense, full of nice and difficult cooperative choices to make, game. The theme is present all the time and you don't know if you´re going to achieve something or lose for the game itself. It's a great, great game! I wish I could play it again.

This is one of those cases where the experience is better than the game. 

I had to trade it away because I wasn't getting any chance of playing it in my group.

If you have endless patience, a good gamer's brain, and are into the theme, give The Republic of Rome a try. It has every aspect of the ancient Roman theme you could want, and I can imagine that if you have a group of people who know the game well, all that Senate debate would be an absolute blast. Gorgeous production to boot in the Valley Games edition. Downside: the game also comes with a tricky rulebook and a great deal of complexity, accounting, and fiddlyness.  Overall, the learning curve is a force to be reckoned with, and those looking to immerse themselves in the Roman world will also be immersing themselves in memorization tasks and many nights of reaching for those rules again and again and again. There is greatness here, but no one involved in the game's design believed in "Simplify, simplify..."

There are some very cool elements to this game, the forum phase being especially interesting.  There are many random factors to the game, and while I am OK with randomness in games, I like some ways to counteract the randomness which seemed to be lacking here.  The wars seemed to ramp up rather quickly and leave little room for error.  The endgame turned out to several choices of: Do I let the game beat us, or do I put (insert name here) a better shot of winning the game and not I?

RATING: 7
No man is an island.  This is especially true for senators in The Republic of Rome.  The rise and fall (well mostly fall) of the Roman empire in an evening.  Up to 5 players control senate factions and cooperate to run Rome while trying to position their faction as the most influential.  External and internal enemies abound, but this doesn't stop the bickering backstabbing bribing and strong-arm tactics of the factions.  The game has a huge amount of randomness, not uncommon for an AH game of this era, but none the less, it creates huge swings in fate, and when I say fate, I mean fate, there is a chit draw for senators to die of natural causes.  Let me understate it when I say that when one of your few (~2-4) senators dies, it kind of sucks.  With a single chit pull, your faction can go from a force to be reckoned with, to an afterthought.  

If you can successfully avoid  death, assassination attempts, persecution, a highly influential senator can eventually be made Consul for Life and win.  There are other ways to win of course;  You can have the most influence when the game ends, or you can bribe legions and march on Rome.  But there are more ways for Rome to lose.  Civil unrest can reach a point where the citizens revolt, the treasury can become bankrupt, or the strain of persecuting foreign wars can crush the republic.  

The game itself is long, dense, heavy, fiddly, and slightly obtuse, but once you get beyond the mechanics, it is the political maneuverings that are the real meat of the game.  This is the interaction and backroom deals creates the mood and tension and in essence the fun.  Funny enough one of the players pointed out that with a 40 page rulebook, much of the game takes place in the section of the covered by two words: "other business".   I think this game would be come horribly tedious with the wrong group.  You really do need 5 players who are engaged and motivated and willing to withstand the emotional rollercoaster that it is to be a senator of Rome.

In my one play, I had senators die of natural causes, die in battle, be assassinated, and lured away by courtesans,  but at the end of the day, my political maneuvering resulted in my second most influential senator being elected Rome consul, and then my most influential senator was appointed dictator (for the greater good of Rome, a strong leader was required) at the final climax of the game.  Any card draw could result in the end of the game; but Rome was embattled in the never ending Punic War, the treasury was too low to raise enough troops to prosecute the wars, and civil unrest was at the breaking point.  The inexperienced self-serving dictator, only looked after his own interests and ignored the issues crushing the republic.  Did he propose a landbill to quell the public? NO.  Did he use his personal cash to sponsor games?  No.  In fact, when one of the senators suggested that the Dictator should be sent off in a glorious effort to wage war vs. the Carthaginians and Hannibal, he quickly and selfishly ended the voting session.  On the next State of the Republic roll, the citizens of Rome revolted and overthrew the senate.  I am sure the bodies of the entire senate were dragged through the paved streets of Rome that day; but my hope is the beleaguered (former) dictator Fabius found his way out of the burning senate through the secret catacombs beneath the forum.

The best political boardgame that I've ever played, and probably one of the most enjoyable games I've played. It's greatest weakness (as has already been noted) is the length of the game as well as the complexity of the rules, something which is not helped by a rather opaque rulebook. It is more than made up for (in my opinion) by the elegance of the game itself, which shines the most in its full 5 player glory. Surprisingly, the game can also be very entertaining as a 2-player or solo-game.

"usually willing to play" does not apply to me for this game. But when you play it with REALLY willing players once every ~3 years its big fun. My rating would be higher but it's length (with senate hearings over and over) is just to much (for me). I did not subtract points for the abysmal rule book and the in terms of clarity and simplicity less than perfect printing as the game is really old and there exist updated versions online.

The perfect game for gaming groups that like really heavy games with lots and lots of negotiations. Everybody has so cooperate, because if Rome falls, everybody looses (unless somebody is a rebel, then he wins). But while it is important to cooperate to keep Rome strong in order to not lose the game everybody wants to position themselves in such a way to gain personal power, because only one player will win in the end (unless everybody looses). Beware, if you appear to strong people will gang up on you and you will be put in a really bad position. 
But wait, maybe somebody does not want to have a strong Rome because if Rome is in a weakened state they might win by declaring themselves the strongest rebel. You have to watch out for so many subtle ways your opponent can win the game. The game might go from everybody seems equal one round to boom one player wins the next round, but if they do it is the other players who have not played optimal and should have forseen it and taken mesures to prevent it several rounds before it happens.
This game is so complex, and you can think of so many devious ways to backstab and position yourself that it makes "diplomacy" look like a happy light childrens game.
It does require a dedicated gaming group, and one player can ruin the game if he wants to. Not reccomended if you play with people who gets upset and does stupid things.

My number one game of all time if we have the time to play it (which we usually don`t), Republic of Rome!

I find the theme of the game very original: controlling a faction of the Roman senate and decide the future of the republic.
I love the semi-collaborative approach of the game. Players have to collaborate for some common goals, namely to fight the enemies of the republic, keep a solvent economy, etc. In the same time, they have to enrich themselves, gain influence, sabotage other player's plans... You have to balance your selfishness and collaboration to win. That's an amazing idea!

The game mechanics are more RPG than board game. I mean, you can almost do whatever you want, propose any kind of motion, discuss it... which is good. However, that brings a very complex rule system. My main concern here is that lots of rules refer to situations that occur rarely. It's a hard game to learn, explain, play correctly.

Another problem. Ok, you can discuss about anything. In fact, you have to discuss about everything. Most of the time, At least 3 of the 5/6 players have to agree on every single decision. And the game is very strategic... that means endless discussions. Yeah, you feel like in a senate, trying to convince the other factions why you should be assigned that concession which makes rich the person who possesses it. It's really funny the first hours, but 5 hours of discussions are to much for almost every human being.

And here there is my other main concern. This game should be played with 5 o 6 persons. And requires 5 hours, more in the firsts games. Plus some more time if you have to explain them the rules... good luck finding such a group.

The game has different scenarios, several optional rules, etc. It seems that, if you can regularly play with the same group, the game has a lot to offer. I can imagine that, for experts, the senate discussions don't last too much. And the complex rules are no longer an issue after the firsts plays. However, arriving to this level may be very difficult. Your 5 or 6 player group want to invest a lot of time in this game? Try it. But it is definitively not a game to play with different people from time to time.

Has to be my favourite non-wargame.  Excellent game for negotiating and subtle--or not so subtle--politics.  Love the balancing act that has to played between personal goals and the maintenance of Rome!  The maintenance and defence of Rome require some extensive debate, manipulation and compromise that is the meat of this awesome game.  They don't get much better.

Amazing game of negotiation and backstabbing, coalition-forming and betrayal. Poster child of the coompetitive game category - together against a common non-player enemy, but only one player gets to win (at most!).

Three *very* different scenario's
* Early republic which is mostly about coop, with tiny sprinkles of treachery
* Middle republic which is all about jockeying into position
* Late republic which is all about the well-timed revolt.

Great fun.  The game captures the feel of its subject matter beautifully, and maintains wonderful tension between competition and cooperation.  The assassination rules add too much of a random element (hence I don't rate it 10), but on the other hand you couldn't really remove those rules without hurting the thematic value of the game.  The rules are badly written, too - I suspect that if they were tidied up they'd double in length (Magic Realm, anyone?).

I played [thing=1513][/thing] years ago (around 4 years), but at this time I didn't recorded plays nor comments regarding games. So, in this new phase of actually doing stuff, I had the opportunity to play the game again and, thus, I'm able to comment more precisely about it.

However I won't really talk about the rules of [thing=1513][/thing]. It just has lots and lots of them. To completely simplify, a round of the game is: rolling to take a card or activate one event (if the number rolled in two d6 is 7), then do one action - try to contract a knight (to gain more votes in the Senate), sponsor some entertainment (to gain popularity and placate the tension in Rome), or try to convince a Senator (neutral or of someone else) to join your faction.

Then there is the Forum phase. This is were the game shines, since players act as members of the Forum, wanting to gain prestige, position, popularity, avoid persecution, propose investments, and so on and so forth. Almost everything in the game is at the table and can be used as a bargain chip. You can say that if a senator of yours is elected Censor that you won't go after the corrupted senators of the Consul. Or if your senator is elected Field Consul that you most definitely will accept going to war against Carthago. Or say that, only if you are elected Pontiff of Rome, you will "bring" Quintus Fabius to fight the macedonians.  In here one can propose how many Legions or Ships must be built. Laws can be made. A General in the filed might ask for reinforcements, and the Senate decides if they will agree or, if they don't, how many of those Legions will be sent to the effort of war, as they might fear that the General becomes a rebel, since already so many veteran legions are loyal only to the General.

A senator may put his name to be Consul, saying his popularity will help to put the romans at easy, even in the face of the many difficulties due to man shortage, plague and droughts. But the senators, not wanting to put too much influence behind one name and/or faction, chooses another one, almost unknown, and the speech in the steps of the Forum is as bad as one could expect, bringing Rome to the breaking point. The senator says that this is everyone else's fault. Others argue that the people is fickle and no one can predict how they will behave. Accusations fly around.

Money should be spend to make Rome happier, more than one faction point this out, but which one will be to one to actually spend money, when everyone is holding coins to try to steal the loyalty of an influent senator. No one usually wants to see the roman people angry, but none also wants to be the first to help, but will gladly follow when someone else start to spend money.

Then comes the War phase. This is the time the Generals face the enemies in the sea and land. Usually with undecided results, since the senators hold on to the troops. And also don't want that the General come home too soon - he is most useful when he is out there, and not using his influence and popularity to be in the fight for positions in Rome. Not good, not good at all.

This is basically the gist of [thing=1513][/thing]. Is a board game, sure. But is also, mostly, a game of political schemes set in Rome. At least we play more like an RPG, with as much roleplay as we can put into it, more than care for the rules. For instance, after we start playing, we had some issues with the rules regarding War. We notice that fighting it was worst than we thought. The normal reaction would be some mumbles, trying to do over without change much of what happenned after, and went proper from that point on. But what we did was...

The General (fighting Carthago): "What? What devilry is this? Do you want to take the glory of my naval win against my enemies? I told you all I need more ground troops to crush my foes, but did you heed to my words? No! And now you want to act as if the war never happenned? What more?! Do you want to take my family name also?"

Senator 1: "Did the blow to your head was too much for you to retain your mind clean? You never won! We cannot take what never occurred!"

Senator 2: "Well, knowing that the army was so much larger than we initially thought, it would made sense to send more legions. I would have vote differently if..."

The General: "Do you see? You are all blind inside this marble house of yours! Only trickery and lies!"

Senator 3: "Well, senator, if you want to increase the war effort, please, Rome will gladly take your donation! The coffers of the Republic are strained as it is."

Senator 2: "Uh..."

Senator 1: "And if the General stays in the field, might be easier to nominate one of your friends, or even you, to the Consul position..."

We did correct the rule, but what was a win against Carthago turned into an stalemate, and the General player wasn't mad with the rules fumble, but with the senators!

[thing=1513][/thing] isn't the most polish games considering its rules. The rulebook is difficult to understand, going by that dreadful gamebook sort of rules explanation (turn to the section 7a to see...). Also, there is plenty of luck - you can start without any senators that can be "upgraded" or your most influential senator can, well, just die - and this is made by randomly taking a chit out of a bag. There are dice rolling for several important things (war, contract knights, trials, assassinations). However, there is balance - but the one that comes from players. For instance: you can have Scipio Africanus, accomplished general, boasting big popularity and legions under your command. Very nice. And Scipio might never win a single position in the Forum, simply because he is too awesome and none of the other factions want to give it more power. He might just be the right man for the job, but the wrong one must do. I had one senator - Terentius, if I'm not mistaken, and he was basically nothing. He never had a single elected position except being the cosponsor in a Land Bill. And he was exactly the person the others were looking for a harmless fellow to become the new Consul of Rome! The contrary is also true: Scipio might agree to go to war, only if someone is his faction is declared Dictator! A dire request, but, the affairs of the State can require decisions like this.

It must be pointed out that a game of [thing=1513][/thing] can last several hours. Several. We discussed for around 10 minutes in the Senate for something we already had agreed on! Simply because everyone wanted to be sure that everything would be accordingly to the deals made. There were those that wanted things to be said in front of the whole Forum, so that, if you break the deal, you would fall into shame. Even though you wouldn't, as none there should be trusted. Some might pity you (but, still, better you than him), others would only think you are naive and a fool. Some could even be impressed by the nerve required to betray a deal - it shows that he got what it takes.

So, simply put, [thing=1513][/thing] is great. A blast to play with the proper people. Maybe not particularly the rules lawyers (but they might come handy to face the rulebook in the field of battle), but the talkative, the devious, the liars, the ones without feelings and the ones that are all feelings.

Playing [thing=1513][/thing] is an experience to remember.

Factions cooperate to maintain the viability of Rome throughout the Empire while striving to amass the most power for themselves - all while avoiding the treachery of other factions, of course. Extremely heavy semi-cooperative American-style game oozing with theme. Very long game that can average well over 4-5 hrs to complete. Can also be played solo, which is the reason why I obtained a copy in 1994. Would have liked to try it in a group but I didn't have any guinea pigs with enough patience and time for a game of such complexity.

The history and depth of the game are big draws, along with the "coop but solo win" aspect.  And there's nothing like Diplomacy with a whoppin' big pile of steamy theme slathered on.  Not that the game is ol' Dippy but knowing how to get your way helps.

Ok, got to run a 4 player game.  I really thought I had given this one a ten and I'm seriously considering moving it up.  I'll give it another game or two to decide.

After two more games, the theme is still just as rich and we're starting to actually play the "enlightened self interest" part of RoR.  I'll hold off on the 10 until we've had a really brutal game.

After seven games, one mid and six early, I'm still going to leave this at a nine.  It really wants to move to a ten but there is an element of luck that distinguishes this from Diplomacy.  Sure, a player has to plan for the luck but given the length of the game a bad roll or draw can be quite disheartening.  The theme is still fantastic.  Nine or ten, nine or ten.

Ya know, this is still undecided between 9 and 10.  Nothing in life or politics is guaranteed and this game models that perfectly, but for 10+ hours of gaming goodness to come down to a TDR or two...f' it, this is a ten.

Clearly a masterwork by designers who are intimately familiar with the Roman republic.  The ties to the theme are strong without putting the gameplay flow on rails.  The deal-brokering, politicking, and compromising are exactly what I think of when I think Roman senate.  Touches of history are all over, such as the dual Consul system, the power of the Censor, and even the appointment of temporary dictators.  Everything that's good and juicy about Roman politics has made it into this game.  This means that the game has a high amount of rules overhead, but it is worth it to anybody with an interest in the topic.  If you don't have even a remote interest in the topic, your patience for the intricacies of the rules may be lesser, but remarkably, the gameplay hangs together very well.  Tension against the game is high, and tension against the other players is even higher.  Any fan of negotiation games should try this one.

The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history. It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic. The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate. They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents. To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome. While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained. A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure. If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!

Comment for the VG version as I now have both the AH and new version.  The new version manages to marginally  streamline the rules and fix a few minor problems with the endgame.  The component quality is much better and the board is graphically nicer as well.  I have an issue with the way the made the card color run out to the edges which make the different cards easy to recognize when in a stack.  I'll have to fix this by sleeving the cards.  For all the time it took VG to get this out the door, they should have proofed a few of the errors better.  I'd give it a 10 if they had done a bit more QA on it.

Only played 3 times in my life - I hope I can add 1 or 2 more times as it's an incredible game, extremely sophisticated rules, but no "useless" ones, meaning that every rule adds to the game an important aspect. Furthermore, it's an excellent simulation of Roman politics, as close to reality as a game can get.
The downsides: I had to learn the rules anew for every session because after 2 years or so you simply forget the 40 pages of rules. And then I have to teach  the rules to the other players - oh my!

Once you grok the rather complex rules, this game is quite playable and fun.  You'll need to play it twice to figure it out, but then it will play briskly.

(Desire: low) frustrating if you're not all in sync, because you can easily lose the whole game if there's no cooperation.  perhaps playing a few games of Lord of the Rings before this would help.  maybe the score will go up with a few more plays.

Haven't played yet, but dying to. Looks like it's right up my alley: lots of player interaction, complex strategy, historical theme.

Sólo lo he jugado una vez, pero me decepcionó mucho, pensé que tendría mucha más gracia, lo vendí y me compré el Battlestar Galactica, que sin ser exactamene lo mismo, se parece mucho más a lo que buscaba.

Epic. Combines negotiation, strategy and role-playing in quite a unique manner. Hours of wheeling and dealing, and a great flair. Sure, it's very complex and demanding. You will need some matches to get into it. Don't play with less than 5 players (except for test games).
 
There's something about the concept, though, that is a little awkward. Something about the time-scale. A turn represents one year and five years and twenty years at the same time. Without having given it too much thought, my first suggestion would be to cut it down to the late scenario. Start from there to find a different approach to a theme perfect for game simulation.

As a final note, I don't mind long games, but this is just too long. If you negotiate and roleplay a lot, this game can take 7-8 hours, which is just 1-2 hours too long, even when using game ending mechanics like the kill card or the like.

Unfortunately played only once (very bad rulebook). Took us very long to get to playing and we could not finish the game due to lack of time. 
Would be willing to try again with someone who knows the rules properly.

Requires a lot of time to play which keeps its score down.  Great game, but requires more time to master than I have.

I wish I knew how to play this game properly. It's a beast, but such a compelling one. Brings Rome's problems and internal politicking to life.

12/19/11 -- Rating 9:  RoR has grown into being one of my favorite games.  We get to play it from time to time, and it's always awesome.  Maybe we'll even get to play the Middle Republic scenario some day.

11/23/09 -- I believe we've finally hurdled the learning curve after our 3rd game (basic rules only).  Of course, this was just getting the rules down; actually understanding the nuances of good play might take a bit longer.

I was pretty disheartened after our first game and felt that the effort to learn the game couldn't possibly be worthwhile.  However, the game continued to intrigue our group and we persevered.  Republic of Rome covers a lot of gaming ground and rewards the persistent with a very rich gaming experience full of politics, intrigue, negotiation and cooperation.  It is also fun to watch the similarities between a game about Ancient Rome and modern politics in the USA surface.

8/1/07 - Having had some time to reflect, I just don't see the pay-off in investing more time into this game.  I'm not saying it's not a fun game, but that the energy-investment trade-off required to get to the good does not work in my favor.  Maybe it sounds weird, but I think Quo Vadis?, which I heart dearly, will really end up being sufficient as the sole Roman Senate-themed negotiation game in my game-closet, and, deep down, I can't help but think that the 7-or-so hours I spent playing this game could have been spent playing 2 games of Dune instead.  *sigh*
----
6/17/07 - It seems to me that we're slowly exiting the age in which games can afford to expect players to spend their first time with it in complete confusion and bewilderment.  In Republic of Rome's defense it was designed prior to this new age I describe, but, if a game's reputation is to be considered, it will have to survive unforeseen gaming trends or face extinction.  So the real question becomes this:  is the effort of reading and re-reading the rules, and then spending 30ish hours (combined individual gamer time invested) for a learning session worth the gaming enjoyment payoff and will it incite repeated plays?  Even if it is, is there perhaps a newer game that "scratches the same itch"?  For me, these questions go unanswered after my first time playing it.  I hope to one day form a firm answer to these questions, and here's to hoping I get the chance (imagine raised mug of beer).

Now, THIS was a game I used to play with my friends and would want to own it just for that "trip down memory lane" factor.

Of course this is also a great game.

Of course this is also Avalon Hill (but hey, even the reprint would be ok).

AAAAARGHHH!

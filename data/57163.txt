RATING: 6.5
Componentes visualmente atractivos y de buena calidad, sobretodo las piezas plásticas hexagonales. Leyendo el reglamento parece bastante más entretenido de lo que en realidad es, y aunque las mecánicas funcionan bastante bien, no hubo tensión ni diversión en toda la partida. Podría decirse que es frío y abstracto. Abstenerse ameritrashers y aficionados a temáticos.

RATING: 5
A good idea, but lacks the strategic depth. Now you just generally go with the flow. If players would get to choose, in which order they played their pieces (and at the same time bid for the turn order), this would be more fun. If I'm ever to try Gonzaga again, I'll suggest this house rule.

RATING: 7
Its frustrating to play but its not very interesting. You want to put your fiefs next to each other but at the same time you want them covering sets of far-flung harbours and cities: thats about as engaging as it gets, and the weddings+rings are there to get the game past this incongruity. Simple mechanically and quick, difficult conceptually and overproduced  .

Gonzaga is cool in its own way. It combines funky spatial decision-making with action programming. Although, the gameplay options are a bit slim and the theme really makes little (if any) sense--it's a nice palate-cleansing Euro with a unique feel.

Be sure to try this designer suggested variant - all players play off the same fief deck (ie all players will place the same piece each turn), turn order is determined by your choice of A,B,C or Crown cards. If two or more players choose the same letter card the tie is broken by current score.

RATING: 5
A sort of tile-placer, except that the "tiles" are plastic arrangements of hexes of different shapes and sizes.  Placement is constrained, both by castles on the pieces (that have to go on land) and by the requirements of an action card that you choose each round.

Your aim is to score by covering harbours and cities and by building the largest network of pieces.

I feel that Gonzaga is a reasonable game, but that it has a couple of problems.  First, if another player places in the spot you had planned to, that can put a real dent in your score.  Second, each player draws a bonus card at the start showing two varieties of city symbols; covering those symbols scores escalating numbers of victory points.  Be unfortunate enough to draw the same symbol as an opponent and watch your score suffer.

Production and artwork are both pretty good.  The board is handsome.

RATING: 4.5
The best thing I can say about this game is that I have at least tried it.  

Why do I dislike this game?  I like a game with a bit of luck but the few decisions in it are uninteresting, and even the luck factor (which is large) just left me cold.  But the worst part of this game is that the pieces are already tricky to assess with respect to the board (laying oddly shaped combinations of hexes onto a board marked with hexes) but the board itself is poorly marked.  I don't usually mind spatial puzzle games at all, but I had a headache by the end of the second turn and had lost interest.  Perhaps if the lines had been drawn more thickly?  Or perhaps not.  To quote Officer Barbrady from South Park - "nothing to see here, move along"...

I thought Gonzaga a good game.  It employs a unique area control mechanism, but I think this same mechanism also makes it sometimes hard to visualize whether the pieces will fit into the spot you wish to place them on the board.  Those who are better at spacial perception will do better at this game, and thus probably enjoy it more.

RATING: 5
Decent plastic-piece-laying game with lots of distinct objectives: cities, harbors, longest chain (while blocking opponents), secret objective. Variable number of turns, 6 to 12. Must plan ahead a bit, too: choose your plastic piece shape (randomly), your placement country, your placement type (harbors, cities, combo or a "marriage") and your hopeful turn order -- but your plan may go awry if an opponent places his piece where you wanted to go. Additionally, the country and type you choose are unavailable for your next turn. 

One issue I have is that the 15-point "longest chain" bonus is too high. If the game is balanced (and I think it is) and the scores are close, whoever gets this bonus will win the game. Seven points might be better.

Overall, Gonzaga doesn't overstay its welcome and is an okay game.

For fans of area control, this game brings it in spades.  From bulking plastic pieces that cannot be denied once played on the table to spatial relationships that can compound the most experienced hex-board gamer into desperately attempting to reform the basic angles of a hexagon.  Game play is very straight forward.  Game length is nicely controlled to ensure the game doesn't overstay its welcome.  Scoring is clean with just enough options to vary player strategies.  While not for the visual non-astute, fans of spatial games owe this game at least one play through.  A surprisingly nice game that might fall under the radar but shouldn't.

Gonzaga has a beautiful board and is a strategy planning game. I was instantly turned off by the plastic, primary colored fifes, but after I got over that, I found that I really enjoyed the game. It was tight and tense. I'd like to play this again soon. There is just barely enough time to accomplish what you want to.

Juego con mecánicas y elementos interesantes, Gonzaga. Este es un juego extraño. Primero destacar los intentos loables del diseñador por hacer algo fuera de lo común. Lástima que dichos intentos no hayan llegado a buen puerto ya que original el juego lo es. 

Las piezas hexagonales de plástico son interesantes, pero el juego es simplemente soso. Sensaciones de poco control en la partida son una constante. Su carencia de tema lo hace abstracto como el agua destilada, incolora, inodora e insípida. 

Lo mejor que puedo decir del juego es que hay que probarlo para saber que no te gusta. Otro punto que destaca es que estéticamente es resultón. Me desagradan los juegos familiares de corta duración con un puntito de azar si estos son divertidos y amenos, pero es el caso Las pocas decisiones que nos ofrece por turno y el factor suerte moderadamente alto, simplemente me dejó frío. A lo mejor es que no me gustan los juegos con componente de rompecabezas. Un juego sin pena ni gloria.

Beautiful looking game. The playing pieces and the map all look very good. The game is build on a simultaneous action selection mechanic. You have to build your abstract little "kingdoms" (or whatever they represent) on the board in a way limited by the action you selected. Your goal is to ensure you build on as many harbours and cities as you can. End of game bonusses are awarded for a secret mission and for having connected pieces. It played very elegantly but I'm not sure about the replay value of this game. For the moment I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

Reading the rules and reviews online, I thought I would really like this game. Hidden agendas, clever placement, puzzles, an interesting where-and-how I can place mechanic, a cool method to prevent spamming. Unfortunately, this is a great example of games sounding good that just don't work for me. I found this game not only boring, but also frustrating. The spam preventing option makes you have to think a turn or two in advance, but without knowing what piece you will be working with next, there's no real way to do that. The amount of thinking/AP that had to go into turns is way to high for the result. To top it all off, because of the shape of the buildings, it's hard to see the icons sometimes and you have to stand up to get a view of the board. All and all, I played this twice and would not play it again.

RATING: N/A
I'm sure some will love it- I loathed it, playing it just felt like frustrating work, and games are supposed to be fun.

Problems with the game for me:

Pretends to offer strategic choices by restricting you to not be able to play the action you did last time ... but you have no idea what shape bit you will get next time, so it's not exactly a choice, rather a crap-shoot.

There are only 3 actions (a/b/c) plus the king so you're going to clash quite often, and the tie break is the number on your shape card, and that seems rather luck dependant. Going last and not being able to place your bit sucks.

Blind action selection, so you either have to try to second guess what your opponents are doing and plan accordingly, or just plan and hope, or plan and try to have 2-3 backup plans ... all leading to major potential for AP - you get your shape, plan your turn (fortunately you're all doing this simultaneously), then reveal the actions - then discover you're not going first and then have to rethink what you are going to do with the action and tile now ... 

If your secret score card duplicates a symbol with someone else, good luck getting any score from that.

Theme is paper thin - this is an abstract, I'd rather have played it without the theme.

Finding the bits to play, ok it gets easier as the game goes on, but still annoying

Overall I just don't much like tactical/puzzle/opps you can't do what you've planned so now rethink abstract games - never want to suffer this one again.

I feel bad I pooped so badly over this game, while playing it, but it really was not for me. There were a couple of little rules, that really just felt rulesy. I like there to be a theme and the theme to match the game. Even Torres felt a lot more thematic than this game. I ended up winning and I don't feel like I deserved it, and that works against the game, for me too. I would play it again, sometime, but not anytime soon. That might help me enjoy it more. A little understanding of the game mechanics.

This was an abstract, but not a fun abstract like Clans or Through the Desert.  I think I feel more down on the game now than I did over a year ago... Sad...

The colors of the pieces kindle the nostalia of 1970's Parker Brothers games. I really like this game. I think it is a nice mix of piece placement combined with trying to figure out how important it is to my opponents to place before me.

Shape-laying game with interesting card play mechanic. If others go for your secret objectives, you score will really suffer. 35 points is not to be sniffed at. The most connected pieces award of 15 points is hardly worth chasing if you don't score a lot of points along the way.

An interesting concept, marred by the final scoring. There are 8 different symbols on the board, you are trying to claim 2 types of them. Unfortunately, it is possible that two people can be dealt the same symbol, while the other two players have distinct pairs. This means some people have to work alot harder without knowing if they have to.

Nice looking board, plastic pieces, and card art, but essentially it is a themeless abstract about placing puzzle pieces on a grid.   It's kind of like a large, slow, multiplayer Ubongo Extreme crossed with Don Quixote.   The goal is to cover certain key spots, but you are forced to play certain pieces amidst several restrictions.   Sea lanes are important for scoring well.  Secret missions, not so much, because most players will likely have parity in that.  There are some physical component issues, despite the game's eye appeal -- scoring pieces don't stack properly (although they were intended to) and the rings do not lay well on top of the castles (although they should).   The game is definitely prone to AP lockdown, so be wary of that.   It's fine as a 45-60 minute game, but at 90-120 minutes, no thanks.

Egyszerűen zseniális. Családi játék, de... 
Nézzük sorban: szép kidolgozás, szép játék elemek, leszámítva a műanyag birtokokat. Mondjuk az sem csúnya, és nagyon nem tudom miből lehetett volna szebben kihozni.(Esetleg fém, fából nem tudom könnyen elképzelni.) 
A játék: nagyon ötletes, nagyon érdekes, végig izgalmas, a játék majd minden periódusában elhangzott: "A pi*-ba nem tudom letenni, azt és oda..." Mókás. Jó látás, térlátás, elhelyezés látás fejlesztés. /Speciális tetris :-)/.
Alapban 4 akciólappal és a vele kombinált terület lapokkal dolgozhatunk. A 4 akció lapka, tulajdonképp 3, hisz az egyik csak az elsőséget adja meg, és egyből elvisz még 1 lapot. És ráadásul a 4 akció lapkából 1 mindig nem felhasználható: azt amit az előző körben. Ugyanez igaz a terület lapkákra is. Így persze pl. ha az előbb várost takartunk le, akkor most nem tudunk csak kikötőt vagy kikötőt és várost. De simán várost nem. Szerencsére a szövetséggel lehet még ilyenkor variálni.
Ami igen fontos: mindenkinek van titkos kártyája, amin 6 város, aminek a megszerzése fontos: az első játékunkban én csak 3-t szereztem meg, a 2 ellenfél 5 és 6 db-t: és 15-25 pont előnyt jelentett nekik. Ugyanakkor ez sem megy úgy simán: jó eséllyel másnak is ugyanazok a városok vannak kiosztva, legalábbis a fele biztos olyan. Ugyanis 2 féle város típus van minden kártyán, és mindkét féléből 3-3. Egy féle városból nincs is több: ez azért konfliktus forrás. Az esküvővel sokat el lehet érni.
Összesítve: jól összerakott, mókás, de mégis komoly, fejlesztő és tervező, de azért inkább családi. Egyedi. /Bár az alkotó elemek egy része más játékokból ismert lehet./. Nálam év játéka díj esélyes lenne.

Update: bár a végét elrontottam, s így csak holtversenyes második az első helyett, de továbbra is tartom: ez a játék sokkal többet ér, mint ahogy értékelik...

Significant replay value is apparent from the options on setup of the game.  First game played wrong ignoring borders of countries, but will correct in future plays.  Overall has some nice choices to make and pressure builds when space is constrained and everyone knows your previous move history, effectively locking you out of specific spaces/regions.  A lot deeper than what is on the surface.

First off, the fact that everyone shuffles their piece order and everyone can only play one shape every turn game the game a nice limitation/replay aspect. It was fairly hard to figure out how to place my piece without figuring out how to optimally lay down one piece from a field of many more (think Blokus) so I liked the rigidity of the forced piece. The game seemed to be a little to easy to achieve your hidden objectives, and there seemed to be little incentive to block others, unless it helped extend your largest chain. Overall, I found the game to be light and enjoyable.

This is an abstract game with a paper thin theme that has nevertheless been excellently produced. The map, cards and plastic fiefs are all excellent, filling the box to the brim.

Unless the spatial element real puts you off then this overlooked game is certainly worth tracking down.

Very nice placement game.
Easy to learn, not so easy to win.
It's neverthless much more tactic than it could look at first glance.
You have to carefully plan ahead your next move or you will have often to give away your fief to the Church for 3 pts.
Good replayability, also for to the short length. Many choices and just too few moves available for accomplish them all. Four different victory conditions: cities & towns held, port monopoly, the longest chain and secret cities.
You need a well balanced management of your choices to stay ahead.

I sat down to Gonzaga with very low expectations, so it was a nice surprise when the game was actually pretty good.

The main activity of the game is placing tiles in your color onto the board.  Except that the "tiles" are actually weird-looking plastic doohickeys.  Each turn, you flip a random card from a personal deck showing which doohickey you'll be placing this turn.  Next, from a different personal deck you secretly choose both a region card and what I'll call an annoying card.  The pair of cards you chose last turn is locked up for one turn and unavailable.  The region card and the annoying card will govern where you can play your piece: touching a specific region and covering specific types of symbols - either cities or ports or both.  These two cards along with the first card you flipped also govern the turn order, which is very important because there is tight competition for space on the board.

You score for covering cities and ports, but there are also bonuses for covering sets of matching ports, forming the longest chain of connected pieces, and covering specific secret locations indicated on your personal goal card.  You'll probably have to get a few of these bonuses in order to win.  The personal goal cards present a bit of a problem.  The locations are grouped into symbols.  Depending on which goal cards are dealt to players (there are more than you'll use in one game), some players may be fighting over the same symbols while other players have no competition for their own.  I view this as a significant flaw - possibly a fatal one - for a game where winning margins are going to be very small.  But I've only played once so far, and I may be wrong.

I doubt I will buy this game, but I would play again if anyone else in my group does buy it.

I love games of tile placement and I like Gonzaga which has some interesting ideas (basically it's a mix of area control/area scoring and a tetris/hextris-like puzzle.

RATING: 7.5
An interesting spatial puzzle where you have to find the best way to place your pieces made of several hexagons. Placement is restricted by the shape of your current piece, the castles on it, the cards you choose to play, barriers on the board and, of course, the placements of other players. You still want to cover certain cities to fulfill your hidden goal card, and harbors with the same symbol, while trying to connect as many of your pieces as you can. Different scenarios, with different flourishing and inactive regions, are used for variety and scalability. It may be a little chaotic with some random and unintentional interference from other players, but overall a pretty good and original game.

Very cool and kinda unknown game. I'm really wondering why it's this way, as it's an easy and nice (looking) game with a somewhat unique feel to it.

There isn't much luck involved, but it can destroy one or another plan of yours. Coolest part of it is that you really need to plan ahead which is not that easy due to the opponents and the bit of luck that's involved.

Good game for familys aswell as for strategic players.

My biggest plesant surprise of Spiel 2009 - this one has been getting a lot of play, and I think it's just a really nice, short Euro with some depth and cleverness which makes it requested by friends and family.  Has a bit of a Ticket To Ride feel, but I find it more interesting.

I was a little frustrated with the spatial aspect of this, and also the blocking aspect.  It's clever in several ways, for instance, the players' inability to use the same action twice in a row, and I'd certainly be interested in playing it again, but on my first impression, the frustration predominates.

This is kind of an ordinary networking game made good by limitations.  You are limited every turn by the shape of your peice,  You are limited every turn by the cards you have available; and you are limited every turn by what your opponents might do.  The combined effect of these limits creates a game of introductory complexity, but with a much more meaty feel.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (December 2013)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game, and I wasn’t disappointed. Gonzaga has great bits that look great on the board (the board is also great), the only component I don’t like are the rings, they doesn’t harmonize with the rest of the board. The theme is paper thin.

The game has simple rules that can be explained under 10 minutes, also it can be played (relatively) quick. However I dislike the random nature of the goals and the tiles. It seem the game will be decided by the goals, if a player managed to get more goal location than his opponents, he will probably win. Also the tiles break ties as to who play first, and I don’t like that. I feel the decisions are (more or less) obvious each turn, and it is mostly luck if you manage to accomplish your plan or not before another player, at least in a 4 player game. If another player wrecks you (by chance) you have a huge disadvantage. I know the king card is there to try to play first, but still these situations left a bittersweet taste in my mouth. Random goals also bring a lot of luck, if two players share a lot of goal locations, more likely they will fight against each other leaving other players unhindered, perhaps if all the goals were separate or all had a lot (of the same amount) of overlap, the game would be better for me. 

To summarize, I feel the game has a lot of uncontrollable luck.

Gonzaga should be better, it has some great ideas in it (I love that you cannot play the same card in a row). The espatial aspect is challenging (at least for me), but at the end it end up as a forgettable game to me. I’m selling my copy of the game BUT I will read the rules, as there is a strong probability that the explainer got some things wrong. Perhaps I’ll play it online.

Current Rating: 5.0
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a very interesting game.  The decisions are very tough, as there are always 2 (or 3) cards you can't play, and invariably one of the is perfect for the fief you've drawn that turn.

It can play very quickly, unless you are spatially challenged.  A/P hasn't been as much of a factor as I feared; in fact, normally fast players have been slow and normally A/P players have been fast.  I really think it comes down to the spatially-challenged aspect of it.

I found most of the mechanisms to be novel, and certainly the way they combine seems unique.  I've played with 2, 3 & 4 and all worked fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Bought this for our spatial child as it looked like it might feel like Tetris on a board.  It is actually more complex that that because you simultaneously are working on an individual end goal, scoring bonuses for shipping groups, and scoring for covering cities and ports.  Good game that I look forward to trying again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Gonzaga plays quickly and is easy to learn. The big problem is that the theme is so boring. Look at the box cover and it should be difficult for you to repress laughter. I wish the game could just have a different theme.

The game definitely works. The decisions are interesting and the spatial element is unusual and the plastic pieces also make the game stick out. But there is little that is convincing or that makes you want to play again. It's inoffensive.

Nice, but nothing spectacular here. It isn't as intuitive or straightforward what it should be. And because you don't have any control of what kind of shape you are allowed to play next, there comes some odd situations. But in the end, an OK game which I'm ready to play again...
Those plastic components aren't the best choice... makes the board a bit hard to see overall situations.

PROS: 
The game has a lot of fans
Pretty easy to learn and play
Can be modified with variants to make it easier for younger players.
looks beautiful.
Tanga deal (not cheap, but under $20)
Given the under 7 avg rating, it's nice to see that there's more people who want in trade than are trading.
Medium weight (2.4)
Scales nicely for 2-4 (although many say best with 3 and above)
Bruno Faidutti likens this to TTR and Blokus (which makes the game more appealing to casual gamers like us).

CON:
Have many other games that are higher on the wishlist.

The game does feel like a cross between Ticket to Ride and Blokus. Yet, it's not as exciting as both of these games. I think it's because the board didn't feel so tight, but that might improve with more experienced players.

Fresh feeling game with elements of spacial awareness, hand management, and set collection.  There are a lot of decisions to be made in a short time frame.  I would be interested in trying a variant in which players have advance knowledge of the next 2-3 tiles.  This would allow for more forward planning rather than having the game be so tactical.

RATING: 7
Obtained 08/04/10. I enjoy the uniqueness of the plastic "see through" fiefs. I think some people may not be fond of the spatial element of the game (will my fief fit?), but as a player of many abstract games I don't mind this at all.  

I did find one thing strange. The whole theme is you are the head a wealthy European family trying to enlarge your land holdings. And the artist used the crests/coat of arms of actual well known families from the period covered on the cards. Yet the rules make no mention of them at all. It would have been so easy to add one sentence to the rules saying, "The green faction represents the Visconti family, yellow represents the Medici, red is the house of Gonzaga, and blue is the house of Este."

08/28/10 Played a four-player game. I was afraid we'd have a lot of analysis paralysis, especially with new players. But my fears were unfounded. The game took 69 minutes; about what I'd hoped for with first time players. 
04/10/12 Played a three-player game. We found it too easy for players to achieve their goals (hidden and otherwise). I think this game absolutely requires the tightness a fourth player adds. 
05/19/14 Played a four-player game. 01/13/15 Ditto. 02/23/16 Ditto. 04/25/17 Ditto.

Once was probably enough for this one. I appreciate that it pays to be strategic, a rarity in games of such low complexity, but it doesn't seem like there are that many strategies to try.

I like the limits that the game places on you - from the shape of the piece, to not being able to use the same cards from round to round. I'm curious to see how easy/hard it will be to fulfill all 6 of your hidden objectives. My concern is that if 2 players get similar objective cards in a 3-player game, the other player will walk to victory. I have similar concerns in the 4-player game, based on the card distribution.

This is one I've wanted to try for about 4 years and finally got a chance. I like it quite a bit. A simple Euro game that by just having one rule (can't play the same cards twice in a row) makes each decision a tough and fun one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A game that often plays quickly, and reads like it should always play quickly, but slows down during later rounds. Simultaneous action selection determines the variable turn order, two of my favorite mechanisms combined. There's a great tension between playing a good current turn and planning for subsequent ones, with a randomization element thrown in; to wit, you don't know what shape fief you're going to draw next. Fast, fun, obliquely competitive; it deserves a much higher ranking (maybe top 250). Plus which other strategy games feature brightly-colored Mousetrap-like pieces? Downside is that the game plays pretty much the same each time.
----
After enough plays, the aforementioned downside has caused this game to hit the table infrequently. This may end up being a novelty game since it plays so similarly each time; it feels like there is a winning solution, with the winning factors being of the king-making ilk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression (3 players): It's a tile placing game. You score points when laying tiles and then there is hidden goal for everyone that they can aim for. Also at the end of the game you get points for having 3 (or 4) harbour cities covered and most tiles laid together. Placement of tiles is limited by the use of cards (area/type) and you can never use the same card twice in a row. This is a good thing that limits your options just enough.

Gonzaga felt good/ok game, perhaps a bit soulless and almost too analytical. At least it was a fast game to play and therefore I'm happy to play it again too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The action selection mechanism is a nice touch: You can never build in the same area twice in a row. The other essential effect of this system is that you usually don't have the action card you'd want to play, so most of the time you are so screwed when trying to place a tile (Which is a good thing, mind you), especially since the board fills up very quickly. 

The scoring scheme might have used a bit more tuning: It' not very satisfying as a whole, and for example the bonus points for the longest chain of tiles can usually be safely ignored.

Dopo due partite sono già pronto per il mio commento. Tipico gioco di piazzamento che parte veloce per poi ingolfarsi a causa di un tabellone ben presto caotico e affollato; infatti giocando in 4, nel finale di partita, le soluzioni saranno 'ad incastro' privilegiando il giocare contro piuttosto che far pochi punti. Regolamento semplice e chiaro, interazione fortissima, durata contenuta e una discreta componente del fattore fortuna (la pesca delle carte/pezzo). Anche la longevità dovrebbe essere garantita dall'effetto del 'regno dormiente' che altera i valori delle regioni ad ogni partita. Consigliato. P.S. ho avuto anche l'onore di ascoltare la spiegazione dallo stesso autore e questo è stato sicuramente un valore aggiunto.

RATING: 7
The board shows a map of Europe overlaid with hexes. The players represent the heads of great dynasties, and try to control contiguous lands. The unusual aspect is that the area control is achieved by placing randomly drawn plastic tiles on the board. These tiles are three or four hexes in size, like hexagon-based Blokus bits! Turn order is variable, there are scores for "capturing" cities and ports, for making sets of cities, sets of ports etc. In truth Gonzaga is quite abstract, with a simple core of area-occupation.
Gonzaga is fairly light-weight, on par with Ticket to Ride or Thurn and Taxis. It takes a little over an hour with four novice players, a little under an hour with experience. The rules are OK, but a little clunky to read. The board is clear and the plastic pieces quite sturdy. I am (just) able to split the colours- players with severe red/green colourblindness should check, but it would be easy to repaint one or more sets.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: A nice fairly light game where you place shapes on the board to claim areas. You use your cards to do this, selecting one card for the area and another for what you can play one (which icons you can lay your piece). The cards you play will only return to you in two turns, thus you must plan ahead and since you have goals for bonus points and also get a bonus for the most connected pieces you must watch out not to get blocked off.

This game involves players filling up a map of Europe with various tetris-like multiple-hex pieces.  Players can attempt to cover up port spaces for fixed points, city spaces to fulfill their secret goal and earn triangular points, or just have the most pieces next to one another to earn a 10 point bonus if they have the most.  Players are bound to get into each other's ways without even trying.  This game is definitely not for the spatially-impaired, and even with a good spatial sense, I didn't find it that compelling.

I enjoyed my first play of this...  

The bits are interesting and the mix of long-term scoring goals (connected fiefdoms and objectives) vs short-term immediate scores makes this rather fun.  I also like the fact that each bit is a different shape on either 4 (mostly) or 3 hexes; trying to put these in some clever fashion makes the game non-routine.

The simultaneous play of your cards and planning decreases downtime as well.

I expect my rating to go up with more plays.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Polyomino-based game with a plausible theme.

Pros: The game plays very quickly and it comes with a lot of large plastic pieces.

Cons:

* Stay away from this game if you are the type of Blokus player who has to actually pick up a puzzle piece and check if it fits on the board. All players simutaneously have to decide (a) what region of the board they want to play their tile and (b) which marked spaces the tile will cover. You cannot simply pick up your piece to verify if it will fit.

* Typical Euro-style scoring obfuscation: There are a lot of ways to score, most of them fiddly and impossible to calculate throughout the game. This artificially prevents leader-bashing and artificially creates tension throughout the game -- if you don't know who's winning, then it's more of a surprise at the end of the game.

Scoring obfuscation of this kind is huge pet peeve of mine -- a game this light should have a similarly light and elegant scoring system.

A very full box of bits in this game!
Easy to learn but tricky to play well. Some spatial awareness needed to work out how the bits will fit on the board, and a lovely mechanic to deprive you of cards used for the next round which leads to frustrated groans when you really need them again immediately! Secret objectives and most connected fief points keep the result in question til right at the end.

Just about the weight I'm looking for nowadays in my average game.  I really enjoyed the constraint of not being able to use the same order or region card two turns in a row.  The only complaint I had was that the primary-colored pieces are garish; black, white, tan, and brown would have been easily distinguishable and much more attractive on the map than green, blue, yellow, and red.

RATING: 6
Gonzaga is an area control hybrid that uses variable turn order, and plastic puzzle-like player pieces. It's certainly a novel concept, but wasn't well executed.

I played a three player game, and watched a four player game, but I can't help but think this game is devoid of meaningful decisions. The depth is about at the level of a gateway game, as I was slightly reminded of ticket to ride. Gonzaga's rules are a bit too complicated for a gateway game, and the length is too long for a filler.

It is fun placing the pieces on the board, but I could even see that pleasure wearing thin after another play or two, which leads me to believe this game to have some serious longevity issues. All of the mechanics that randomize the experience don't seem to matter all that much: with each new secret objective card, the only thing that changes is the symbol, and other than a slight variance in size, it doesn't seem to matter which regions are flourishing and which are not. 

The theme is utterly bland, but the production value is excellent. An abstract puzzle  in the disguise of a typical euro. I may play it again, but never request it.

--Jul2011-- Nice irregular tile placement game.  It's attractive and sensible, with enough randomness to make it a great family game.  The no-two-common-placements-in-a-row rule leads to some lovely manoeuvring, and one can almost justify the "I might have won if my tiles had come out in another order!" whine at the end.

It reminds me a bit of Ticket to Ride in its game play and level of complexity but is able to scratch a different itch.

A surprisingly solid abstract strategy game with a "euro" veneer. Reminds me quite a bit to [b]Ticket to Ride[/b] just slightly more complicated. Given the cheap price and it's lack of attention, I feared the worst; fortunately, this is an under-appreciated gem. Recommended.

Gonzaga -- Played once; three-player.

On  Bruno Faidutti's [url=http://www.faidutti.com/index.php?Module=ludotheque&id=649]Ideal Game Library[/url], he wrote, "With pentominoes and secret goals, Gonzaga feels both like [thing=2453]Blokus[/thing] and like [thing=9209]Ticket to Ride[/thing]."

Now I normally agree with Bruno's game evaluations, but in this case I just don't see it.  Gonzaga is no gateway game.  It lacks the streamlined play of [thing=2453]Blokus[/thing], and the theme-rich instant familiarity of [thing=9209]Ticket to Ride[/thing].

After determining which piece you will be playing, you decide which action card to pair with which region card.  This not only determines where you can place your piece, but also which action and region will be unavailable on your next turn.  The unavailability of a region card doesn't necessarily prevent placement in that region, so long as you can play in an adjacent region and let your piece cross the border.  But the unavailability of an action card is far more restrictive, since action cards determine which type of symbol (city or harbor) may be covered.  Managing card availability is key.

The 10 point bonus for covering three (or four) matching harbors is also significant.  When Rich managed to complete two separate sets in one move, Eric and I knew we were in trouble.

Achieving your secret goals requires some diversion, otherwise opponents will intentionally block you.  After all, if you place a piece which covers only one city symbol, you're asking for your opponents to cover the others.

Gonzaga [i]is[/i] a bit fiddly, but sensibly so.  It has the feel of an abstract to me, in terms of placement — blocking and connecting.  But the rings which can be placed atop another player's piece do ameliorate some of that harshness.

I enjoyed playing it, and I respect the design, but I have no desire to own it.

Essentially an abstract in that you're placing tiles to score victory points. This is an older title that I didn't play early in my career, so it gets no bonus points for nostalgia, and really its design is simply dated at this point. The only interesting twist in the whole game is where you can place your tiles rotates from round to round, so you can't simply always place in just cities or just harbors, so you have to do a little bit of planning ahead. There are hidden victory conditions which do help you to frame your strategy and direct what you're going for, but overall, it's just a basic, simple design that fails to excite me.

RATING: 6
An interesting tile(ish) placement game, although it wasn't exactly a lot of fun. Willing to try it again because it should be pretty quick. However, the spatial element was challenging for all of us! As in Ubongo Extreme, those hexes are not at all intuitive!

--- Summary ---
Each turn, players randomly pick one of their plastic hex-pieces ("fief") to place this turn, using a deck of cards (each with a unique number). They simultaneously pick one of 3 actions (cover 1-3 cities/harbors or place 1-2 of your 6 rings on the board, cover 0-3 cities, cover 1-2 harbors), and a location (country) in which to place it -- with one caveat: may never choose the same region/action as chosen on previous turn. Resolve in A-B-C order (actions marked), using numbers on those initial cards as tiebreakers. When placing, get pts for covering cities/harbors and for covering sets of harbors (or for discarding the fief to the church). The game ends one round after only 0-3 uncovered cities/harbors remain. At end of game, player with most-connected fiefs gets 15pts, and all players score for covering cities in their secret goal cards (dealt at start of game).

Really did not like. The plastic bits are minging and difficult to see how they fit on the board. Plus the scoring is opaque. Not really a gateway or for gamers. Played once will not try again

Edit - did play again under duress and ejoyed it more the second time out. It's caught between two stools of a game for gamers and a gateway and does not work for either. You really need very good spacial awareness to play Gonzaga.

RATING: 4
Gorgeous production in this game about placing tetrahexes to cover harbours (10VP bonus for covering a set of 3) and cities (0-35 points at game end for covering your secret six), plus 1-3VP for covering each one. The polyhex to be placed is randomly chosen; players then simultaneously choose planning cards to dicate where it can go: one location card matching a region on the board and one which dictates both turn order and what can be covered (only habours, only cities, cities and harbours...).

Some of the comments on BoardGameGeek say that the mechanism whereby the location cards chosen in one round can't be re-used in the next is a nice touch to force "planning", but the fact that the piece to place is chosen randomly throws that out the window. Inevitably, the perfect location to place a given fief requires one of the two cards just used. It's not just that it's more tactical than strategic, it's that it's frustrating while it's at it.

An odd game that I felt should be longer: I thought it would be a little strategic, but I suspect it's almost entirely tactical.

Each turn you’re aiming to place an odd-shaped plastic tile to cover the map and score points. Points for ports, points for cities, points for not placing your tile, points for a bunch of ports, points for longest string of tiles, points for covering secret-mission cities.

Awesome game.  The planning is brilliant and the I love how you can't use the same card 2 turns in a row.  That really makes this game shine.  Works brilliantly with 2.  Looking forward to playing with 3 and 4, although I suspect 3 will be the hot spot.

Fans of Fits might like this, but I apparently don't like spatial relations grafted onto my strategy board game experience and found Gonzaga a bit dull and frustrating. It is a somewhat novel idea, however, and it should get some credit for that. Take my rating for what it is ... a personal dislike for this kind of game rather than a reflection of Gonzaga being a terrible or broken game. Gonzaga is neither terrible nor broken, but it is a game I didn't much enjoy.

Gonzaga is a breathtaking attempt to combine an influence game with a spatial game.  Each player's set of giant interlocking fiefdoms is always just slightly the wrong shape, and any placement will disrupt their opponents' efforts.  The result is a delicious game with perhaps a few too many moving parts, but Gonzaga is a unique experience that every gamer should attempt.

I didn't know much about this game before playing it. Pretty much all I knew was that it had been Tanga trash for a long time and that the people I knew who had played it, liked it.

Given that I knew this was being sold off for a couple of bucks on Tanga and other sites for a long time, I was surprised at the game components. There's like twenty pieces of giant tetris pieces for each player, along with a personal deck of cards. Whoever published this game must have lost a chunk of change on it.

On your turn you flip a card from your fief deck and pull the matching plastic piece. You then select an action card and a location card and put them on your player board. You won't get those cards back until the turn after next. Then you simultaneously reveal. The three actions are ordered A, B and C. Generally the player who plays A precedes players who play B who precede players who play C. Except there's a King card that lets you jump the line (but costs a ring to play). In case of ties the fief cards are numbered. So once you've figured out the order, each player places his piece on the board. Depending on the action card you picked this piece must cover either just cities (or just nothing), just harbors, or both cities and harbors. It must cover at least one space of the region you picked, but can extend into neighboring regions.

You get points for covering cities and harbors. Additionally there's a bonus for getting all or almost all of a certain type of harbor. There's also a secret goal where you want to cover particular types of cities. Finally there's a bonus for the player who has the largest chain of pieces.

The game requires you to wrap your head around a couple of things. First, the spatial aspect... which is just going to knock out a bunch of gamers from the get go. Second, the fact that you have to time things around the fact that the cards you play this turn won't be available next turn. And third, the wonkiness related to "weddings" where you can place one or two alternate pieces in lieu of your fief piece.

I definitely didn't quite grok the game correctly at first. And I was a little cheesed to find out that my two opponents were both competing with me for my secret goals, but weren't competing with each other for secret goals. I definitely think I need a second play to find my footing with this one. The game is interesting. I think it will be enjoyable for a few plays, I'm not sure about its longevity though.

About [thing=57163][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=57163][/thing] is a tile (truly, more a piece) laying game, mixed with hand management, area control and simultaneous action selection.

[thing=57163][/thing] is a game that constantly puts players in tough situations, as players are frequently blocking the others, and not only that, the need of making the best use of the pieces, alongside the action and place, make for some difficult decisions (even if not complex ones).

The rules are simple, but create a fine base, as the board became a tetris-like screen, but with several persons trying to fill the gaps.

The production value is good, not great, as the pieces, cards, board and tiles are well done, but the player boards are flimsy and the there is a single card serving as player aid - and the game plays up to 4.

Replay value is high, as [thing=57163][/thing] have several scenarios, the hidden goal of the players change and also the order of the pieces have a big impact in the decisions made.

Overall, [thing=57163][/thing] is a very unique game, playing differently than almost everything. It has a good pacing, with some downtime issues (as the person can try its piece in several ways in the region chosen before settling, and this can take a while, but this can easily be controlled), and offers a good amount of decisions in a relativity short playing time.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
After the set up is done, there will be flourishing regions and inactive ones (1 to 3). Then, at the same time, players will draw a piece card, which will show which piece each person will have to use in that round.  Afterwards, players, simultaneously, will choose a region and an action to do in that region, using the piece they draw. Everyone reveals their choices at the same time, and the actions are carried following the order of the actions and, if the same, by the numbers on the piece cards, from lowest to highest.

The actions are:
a) Harbors: with your piece, you must cover one or two harbors, and no cities;
b) Cities: with your piece, you can cover 1, 2 or 3 cities, and a space covering no cities nor harbors. You can't cover harbors with this action;
c) Alliance: with your piece you must cover either 1 harbor and 1 city, or 2 harbors and 1 city, or 2 cities and 1 harbor. Or, you can use the action to do a Wedding. With the Wedding, you use 1 or 2 rings (each player starts the game with 6 rings), to put on a hexagon of the board - it can even be above the piece of someone else. That hexagon is also considered to belong to you, for purposes of connecting your Fiefs (your pieces), for your hidden goal and for the formation of Sea Leagues. If you put a second ring, it must be in an hexagon adjacent to the first;
d) King's Privilege: this isn't an action per se, it only allows the player to play first, regardless of the action chosen. When chosing the King's Privilege, the player also picks the action she will do, putting it on top of the deck. Once all the actions and regions are revelead, she picks the action chosen from the top of the deck and executes it. There is a cost to use the King's Privilige: one ring.

The turn order, as mentioned, is done by actions: King's Privilege -> Harbors -> Cities -> Alliance. A tie in actions is broken by the number of the Fief piece. 

The piece must cover at least one hexagon of the region chosen by the player, following the rules of covering of the action, can't pass over mountains, can't be placed above the piece of someone else, and the castles must remain on land hexes. If the player can't or don't want to put her piece on the board, she can donate the Fief to the Church, and receive 3 points.

After the piece is put, the player receive points:
- 3 points for cities and harbors covered in flourishing regions, or 1 for each in inactive regions;
- 3 points for donating the Fief to the Church;
- 10 points for forming a Sea League (covering 3 or 4 harbors with the same symbol).

Very important: both the region chosen and the action done won't be available in the next round. Players keep these cards above their players boards.

The game will end if, starting by the end of the 6th round, there are less than 3 cities or harbos uncovered in flourishing regions. When this happen, the next round will be the final one. Otherwise, with 4 or more cities and harbors uncovered, the game will carry on. Regardless, the game will end, at the maximum, by the end of the 12th round, with the use of the last Fiefs pieces.

Then players will score their hidden goals - the more cities in their goal each person covers, more points they will receive: 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25 or 35. Finally, the player with the highest number of connected Fiefs will gain 15 points.

The person with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
It boils down to two main decisions:
a) Which region to pick;
b) Which action to do in that region.

These aren't complex decisions, but do required a lot of thought and timming. Since all the other players are constantly adding Fiefs to board, covering coveted cities and harbors, things quickly starts to become tight. Fiefs start to not fit properly in the spaces, connections are broken, and so on. Weddings, serving both to take what was already lost, and as a 1 hexagon Fief, can enter in small places, but, can give half, or 1/3 of the points a nicely laid Fief can get.

Also, if that wasn't enough, there is more depth to the decisions, as the region and action chosen won't be available in the next round. Therefore, even if you can do something now, maybe you will want to wait, as you next Fief can fit better in your plans for that region. 

Therefore, you start the round pretty sure that you would build harbors in Hispania, only, after some thinking, end up doing Alliances in Europa Orientalis. That is [thing=57163][/thing] in a nutshell.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- High replay value;
- Though decisions coming from a simple set of rules;
- High amount of player interaction, all by blocking, and not by attacking directly;
- Good production value;
- Quite easy to teach;
- Language independant;
- Very unique, both in feel and rules.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Requires a good amount of spatial awareness in order for someone to do well;
- Has some randomness in the draw of the Fief pieces, (but the region and action used with the piece is left to the player);
- Abstract in nature, though some names and and actions have thematic reasoning, there is nome theme coming out of the play;
- Best with 4 players.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in a multiplayer and competitive match of Tetris, all done in a single screen with some dots behind, and only the ones that cover the dots gain points. It can be brutal! Or you could feel like playing a more complex version of [thing=16986][/thing]: making everything fit in the proper place. And there is so much blocking going around that you would take a time out from it by playing [thing=14996][/thing] with 5 people.

[thing=57163][/thing] have many positives going on for it: constant set of tough decisions, short-ish playing time, fine level of interaction, good production, and high replay value. It do suffers somewhat for the lack of theme, and it enters in a type of skill (spatial awareness) that many don't like. Which means it ended falling in that sort of grey area in the ranking, between 1000 to 2000: good, but not enough to be talked about or be remembered. For most of the time it stays hidden. Still, with is unique style and strong points, it is, deservely, a gem. Recommended!

Love this game. Although it plays differently, it reminds me of Thurn & Taxis (another game I love), with regard to the mix of calculated risk taking, the move optimization and the straightforward rules. It also deserves an extra point for originality - having to lay down puzzle shaped settlements on a big board in order to occupy strategic points makes it feel very fresh. The components of the game (especially the map) are great too, even though the planning tableaus are completely unnecessary. Oh, and did I mention that it plays great with just two players? I am not a big fan of simultaneous action selection, but with all the information out in the open, it really fits this game.
Update: The game is definitely played best with three, as there is only one non-flourishing region with four (cancelling the only advantage they have over flourishing regions). Still think it is a great game that can be enjoyed by children (8 & up), adults, gamers and non-gamers alike. I do use the alternate distribution rule for handing out assignments found on the publisher's website.

[b][i]Gonzaga [/i][/b]is a nicely constructed design, with players divided between chasing connections with their plastic doodads, grabbing ports, and securing locations that match their secret scoring cards.

One concern I have with the game is that with more than two players, your success seems driven by how well you do with your secret scoring card – and your success there depends on whether other players are competing to grab those same icons. If they are, then you have a lot of jostling on the board, but if not, then you're far more likely to secure all the spots, or at least more of the spots than any other player. As a result, I've enjoyed the two-player game the best as players are then guaranteed to be on equal footing. What's more, the two-player game takes several regions out of play, which makes for a more interesting game as players try to sneak across borders with their pieces and "cheat" their way to connections.

The day-glo bits clash with the standard issue Euro components that comprise the rest of the game, but that aesthetic issue isn't a game-killer. What is a kiler, however, is the spatial contortions sometimes required to figure out which piece can be placed where. I've had a couple of players ready to throttle me for suggesting this game when I [i]knew[/i] (hunh? what?) that they had trouble with spatial-related games.

Gonzaga left me with a strange feeling of unsatisfaction. It works, it is nice looking and with these strange original pieces it makes a good impression on the table. But the game passes without notice and at the end there is a "so what?" feeling. Dunno why.
Rules are quite simple and in their way original enough (even if after a second though, there is nothing really new), the game flows well but there are no moments when i really felt involved.
A pity.

I play online often at youplay.it.

Nice abstract spacial acquisition game. Good abstract simplicity that I like. Enough variety to keep it interesting. Good balance and limited luck. I would change the chain rules personally making them weaker in order to keep the game focused on the more strategic aspects. Making long chains that win the game with the rings without really making solid overall board play feels weasely to me. That could be limited by not allowing each ring to be worth a point to the chain length or not allowing them on the count at all. But those long chains are often easy to defeat if your overall gameplay is strong. 

Takes a bit of time to learn what sort of play works best and what to pay attention to over time so new players have a learning curve. I feel like this is best with two or three players. Four players really limits the board play and sort of makes it like playing musical chairs.

A very unique spatial puzzle game with a hidden objective.  The production quality is top notched and very attractive.  The experience itself is okay, but did feel rather repetitive after two plays under my belt.  Since you draw each piece randomly, there is simply no way to pre-plan your moves, resulting in a lot of thumb twiddling during other people's turn (and you will do plenty of that since the board is often changed, for the worst, so you have to find new placement on the fly).

I like how Gonzaga took familiar mechanics and mixed them up to create an interesting combination, but ultimately the result does not seem to hold a lasting appeal.  I enjoy it, but don't feel compelled to play it again (I could be convinced to teach it to people looking for something new to try).

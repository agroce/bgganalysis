I love the Tank Leader series, but this is my least favorite of the three.  The tactical doctrine for the Soviets is TOO restrictive.  The Soviets always seem to be at an extreme C3 disadvantage, even in 1945 scenarios when you would think they would have had their act together better.  Still a good game to play PBEM.

RATING: 6
Comprehensive yet assessible boardgame of operational land warfare on the Eastern Front during WW2. Clever use of cards to simulate Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) and other battle-related events made this fairly revolutionary back in the 80's. Fine production values by West End Games also carried the theme well, especially on the cards. Notable also for the "battle-scarred" organizations that both sides were given to fight with: players fought with units that were not to TO&E strength. Games could stretch from a couple to several hours. A remarkable faithful and playable tactical WWII combat game.

RATING: 8.5
Playing the scenarios in chronological order.  A beautiful clean system unencumbered by irrelevant chrome.  Should arguably be called "Battalion Commander" or "BattleGroup Commander".  You really have to think about formations, proper road net rationing, fire and manouevre and the timing of same and proper use of terrain given strict stacking rules.  The game had that feeling of move / counter-move that you see in written military history but that most wargames fail to capture. An enterprising designer could adopt this for several later 20th Century conflicts such as Korea, Vietnam, Arab-Israeli.

RATING: 7
Along with Western Front Tank Leader and Desert Steel, this my favorite platoon level WWII game system.

It uses a mechanic that rates units, grouped into realistic formations which are nicely represented on cards (as opposed to dense charts or handmade spreadsheets), for the "intangibles" that made one side better than another instead of focusing on hardware and specifications, or inflating the unit values.  The command control rules, through these formations and how the players use them, are the heart of the game, which highlight the differences between the armies in both time and place.  They are simple yet satisfyingly sophisticated, depending upon decisions the players make each and every turn, and manage to do this without 'leader' counters.  They work well for "normal" situations and yet are able to portray some of the more unusual engagements of the war in a realistic manner.

The combat mechanics, while involving a number of steps, are well thought out and easily integrate the "intangibles" of unit capabilities with the physical aspects of terrain and hardware, taking into account a range of factors from spotting over distance to unit stacking.  What could be a mess is presented in a modest set of charts on a single player aid card that are easy to read.

The big problem with these games are the scenarios, many of which are poorly designed.  Some of the unit ratings are suspect.  Also,  infantry don't have much ability to stand up to enemy fire, though this is toned down in Desert Steel.  Finally, "off board" artillery and air support are simulated simply but realistically (with built in probabilities of delay and national differences), but the actual combat strength of the "strike" cards seem terribly overpowered - "poof, you're dead".

With Eastern Front, the use of a single map in a multi-battle tactical level game system means the scenarios tend to have a "sameness" feel to them.  The the variable terrain system doesn't really solve this problem.  Things are slightly better in Western Front, which includes two maps.  Sharing the three between the two games would help with scenario design.  Actually, the maps from "Blood & Thunder" work as well, as the terrain graphics are almost the same.

Eastern Front Tank Leader plays much better if you use the Western Front rule set (which are fully backwards compatible), with a few tweaks from Desert Steel (particularly the changes to not allow combining fire against soft targets, and the +3 modifier for Indirect fire units spotting their own target, instead of doubling).

The formation cards are an excellent design feature and the heart of the game.  But they do come with the drawback that they limit the range of formations represented, and occasionally the counter mix is not as wide as it could be (unit types for the British in Western Front are particularly lacking).  Both are a result of budget and space issues, but there is a huge need for expansion of available formations and unit types, as well as extra maps, that was never satisfied.

What's not too like about an operational level game from the designer of Squad Leader?  Some unique concepts for the time including variable terrain map, and command cards. While others may argue there are better games out at this level now I believe that this game still holds its own for capturing WWII command, communications, and control at the platoon level. Something I don't think enough  WWII games take into account in their mechanics.

RATING: 5
This was the first game in a series that had the possibilities of overturning the venerable PANZERBLITZ/PANZERLEADER "lock" on the scale and subject.  The first playings of the game are the best, before the C3 ratings of the cards/formations are well known (and committed to memory)--the tension of not knowing who will get the next few moves is a large part of the fun of the game.  Once the game is mastered, however, play is often felt to be "choreographed."  Still, the game does a great job at showing how the Germans could translate tempo into a weapon at the tactical level; counter strengths/ratings are the not the primary device to show tactical superiority.

Other platoon-level board wargames now achieve the same effects but without the "choreographed"/predictable effects, which has caused this game to slide a good bit in my rating of it.

Tank Leader has a brilliant command, control, communication sytsem for WW2 tactical armored combat simulation.   This simulation is easy to learn, good for beginner wargamers, and has a reasonable playing time.  This system portrays what an army with an excellent C^3 system, organization, training and experience can do against an adversary with numerical superiority, but with poor training,leadership and comms.

Vote is for the simulation, graphics is really bad even considering the standard of games in mid '80es. You can find files to redone the counters It's a demanding job but worth the time spent. Tank Leader is a system so good that more than others deserve to be update and reprint.
Absolutely to have if You can find one at a reasonable price.

Picked this up during the May 2009 Euro Math Trade. I used to have Western Front Tank leader and I always wanted to get a copy of this one. Western Front Tank leader is long gone traded, sold off or given away. Don't know if this one is better or not but I certainly am interested in the subject matter. I really like the card activation for the C3 aspect of this game. 

Update
Having recently learned how to play this game and having played two curtailed scenarios I have to say that I really like this system. The games have been tense and fun. The simple rules make for an easy to play tank fest and are enjoyable. Love the uncertainty of when and what will activate. The maps can be problematic with the variable terrain system. Would like to get some more scenarios played to completion. Last game my opponent had some horrendous die rolls and he suffered due to this!

I have also reacquired Western Front Tank Leader and now have a copy of Desert Steel too!

Game uses cards to activate formations, all units of a formation can take actions before units of other formations. Higher activation rating the better. Cards also indicate moral and other soft factors which determine the effectiveness of a given formation. C3I built into the game in a workable fashion. Cool. Much better than Panzer Blitz or even Panzer Leader in depicting better training, doctrine and tactics.  Didn't like how the maps were to be used. Depending on scenario the terrain changes for terrain symbols. Too much bother. Needed more maps with non morphing symbols.

A simple but realistic system finally brings the problems of command and control to the tactical armor world. Finally the Germans are not better in 41-42 becasue their tanks are better! This is the first in the series and I recommend using some of the changes in the last game, Desert Steel as they improve realism.

A lot of good concepts but just not that interesting a package.  I'd think it would work better as a series of historical modules, similar to what Critical Hit has tried to deliver with ATS.

One thing I *do* quite like about the system is its provision for a "quick kill" result in combat, where an attacker eliminates a defending unit and can then fire again.  While there exist some peculiarities with how the game models hardware (light AT weapons receive too much of a boost at close ranges), this idea is one worth preserving.

I ejoyed the game and found the card system to be an advance in gaming.  The germans are so much better in early war, the russians have a bad time of it.  Germans will control the flow of the game. Once into the later years of the war, they are more evenly matched.  I find it quite accurate as a simulation of what the system is trying to show.

When this was released back in the mid 1980's it was touted as the next step up in platoon level WWII armor combat from Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz and PanzerLeader games. I liked EFTL, and bought the next two games in the series, West Front Tank Leader and Desert Steel. 
On the negative side, the cards needed to play in every scenario were printed on flimsy cardstock and tended to wear out. There is a good game in there that needed further development. If this game series had been adequately supported by West End Games it could have been much bigger. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Command and control cards are excellent in theory, terrible in actual gameplay. Everything bogs down in figuring out card ordering and activation.

10 points for effort, 4 points for execution.

(AMENDMENT - I may have played this game incorrectly, due partially to a hasty rules explanation by the person who taught it to me. Final rating pending play with correct rules.)

Always want to take this game, like a Holy Grail.  Who doesn't want to have tanks in their hands? I want a reprint of this game too.  But...it's kind of hard to find the one who retains the right to it. So I bought it over from BGG second hand market.  Finally, it is in my hand in Nov 09!

RATING: 9
Started the series that remains to this day the best of all platoon-level armor games. A fantastic step forward in the hobby that still is state of the art.  It is fascinating to read some reviews from 20 years back and see the reviewers not being able to handle the notion of cards in a wargame, something that is a frequent feature today. Good history,excellent command control rules, simple and elegant. Slightly less flexible than its two sequels, Western Front TL and Desert Steel, due to lack of geomorphic maps.  Also, the rules of the later games are better and it's best played with those.

RATING: 9
Great, simply great. One of the few tactical game able to succesfully implement a real C3I system. Panzergrenadier come close, but the Tank Leader is awesome. The C3I system is both abstracted and directly represented. Sometime it's a bit difficult to play solitaire.  Nice scenario selection and programmed approach.

--------------------------------

Excellent card driven tactical armor game.  Ahead of its time, some scenarios don't seemed balanced though.  

Very good treatment of C3i... Germans will usually have better troops and better command ratings vs Russians, allowing them to choose when to activate and to fire and spot enemy units more effectively.  Infantry seems a bit underpowered and very slow in this game system. This system should be updated and republished... it would work great I think, for the Arab-Israeli Wars.

This is an excellent game system that didn't really catch on.

Simulation system for tanks, designed for multipurpose situations. Basic and advanced game scenarios. I strongly recommend playing the advanced ones where, infantry, transport, artillery, forward observers, indirect fire and many other issues are carried out. As in Squad Leader, geomorphic map boards are used, with variable contour, urbanization, rivers, and any other terrain feature to set up almost any possible eastern front scenario. Units vary on time, so, depending on the year, the same formation could be green, seasoned or veteran and vehicle improvement in present too. The most of the tank models of the period are present so it is possible to use this game as a fast and accurate historical reference. A great John Hill design if you like tanks and vehicle warfare and as a Hill trade mark, it is possible to play an almost unlimited situations qith just on map and a bunch of unit counters. The graphic design could be better, as in all West End Games. Recommended

Exponentially better than Panzer Blitz.  The scenarios in this module are not really as well designed as they could be.  By the later years of the war I believe there should be some Soviet units with better command ratings.  At any rate, this should be reprinted by someone, somewhere as it is the most realistic and playable of all the platoon armor games.

I am rating this an 8 instead of a 9 because some of the rules are broken. The broken rules have been fixed in Western Front Tank Leader. If using the Western Front rules, then I would rate this a 9. I haven't played this game too many times. I used to play Panzerblitz a heck of a lot, and the the Tank Leader series is superior, in my opinion. I am currently working on a miniatures adaptation of this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I'm really surprised that no one has resurrected this system yet, as I think it represents a real triumph of focused design.  The design tackles the basic question of how the Germans consistently won at the tactical level with smaller numbers and inferior equipment by elegantly modeling their C3I advantage.  The trump system works much better here than it does in GBoH, where it seems somewhat nonsensical.  The major flaw is the map, where terrain switches from scenario to scenario thanks to a regrettable attempt to rein in costs, I suppose.  Still as good if not better than any platoon level game on the market.

I don't feel the cards add that much to the game because their use is often a no-brainer but I think what deters me the most about this game is the fact that most of the scenarios are imbalanced.

With 5 games played, you can't say we didn't give it a descent try. But still, there a a lot more wargames that I would play before choosing this one. The cardplay is a nice idea, but is 95% of the time a no-brainer, so only slows the game down, in stead of adding something.

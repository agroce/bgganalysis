There is a game here. However, it lacks the simplicity and elegance of Mall. It makes up for that with complexity. But since the game is only four turns long, you have very few opportunities to adjust your fate.

As a disclaimer, negotiation games aren't really my cuppa.  Voting for who dies instead of any form of combat seems lame to me.  Some action cards and a few of the character abilities are the only ways to kill zombies, and cards are very hard to come by.  Some characters have a drawback instead of an ability, which is only partially offset by their respective point values.  LNoE is probably still my zombie game of choice, and I'm not crazy about that one either...

RATING: 5
July -   this game started out ok. The group I was playing with was mostly working together, burning cards and generally surviving. Then we ran out of cards and things got tense. The game is well produced and if you're a fan of this type of game, this is a game you'll like. I'm not.

This is the kind of game where 3 people are in a room, and someone has to die. You vote and whoever is best able to swing someone to their side wins, odd man out dies. The problem is, having a character die is a pretty big swing, so it's hard to stay in the game, through no fault of your own. And the game is long (2 of the players had AP, for example I ate half a hamburger and a slice of pizza on one of their turns). 

They wanted to win, I understand. But I will avoid this game the next time it comes up.

Pros
- Zombie theme peeks through well
- Negotiation and trading is fun
- Shooting zombies 
- Voting to feed someone to the zombies is great

Cons
- Too many icons to keep track 
- Everybody better get a player aid
- Some parts feel really mechanical and gets in the way of the theme like the zombie color wheel

Sold/Traded because:
- Hard to teach because of how phases went, unintuitive 
- The theme didn't mesh as well as it should have

Nasty negotiation game. It's thematically perfect for our group but it suffers from fiddly rules and a horrible rulebook for what should be a simple game. It's too faffy and complex for its payoff (or complete lack thereof). Want a nasty negotiation game? Play Lifeboats. It's totally superior in every way.

RATING: 8.2
Only played this through once. With the wrong group, I can see this stagnating. I see how tenuous and useless alliances are in the last turn. I can also see a lot of opportunities for king making, especially from grudge-bearing players. In the group I played with however, the negotiating was tense and smart, the backstabbing was prevalent while always being sensible or properly implemented (to win the game as opposed to spite.) With the good fortune of having played this under the right conditions, I really loved this game.

City of Horror is fun and lighthearted, but it doesn't scale as well as I wish it did. Extensive use of symbols takes some getting used to but it is an easy game to teach and play once you get past that. One outstanding part of the game: the artwork/characters are absolutely great.

Top-notch! I've seen it played nice, but the bloodier it is, the more fun it ends up being. It's easy to teach and a good introduction to board gaming. It might be somewhat player dependent, but more often then not it is a universal hit. Because I've mostly played it with new people, I still haven't had a chance to try out the card drafting of action cards. Worth noting that a 3 player game of this was, surprisingly, just as fun as bigger games.

Fairly brutal negotiation game. Something about it just doesn't strike me. I think it's because your negotiation platform is so random. It's all based on what cards you draw rather than how good you are at negotiation... the negotiation is pretty much an afterthought, and to me that makes the game kind of... bad.

That said, I would certainly give the game another shot, but I'm not going to rush out and buy it.

Blunt cut-throat game. 'Live and let die' mentality (ok, turn-lasting friendships too) + being in the correct place at the right time is the combination you are looking for.

Overall a fine game to play (preferably amongst friends to avoid trouble :P )

Nasty. A game in which the main mechanic is voting on which of your friends to feed to the ravenous zombie hordes. Repeatedly. An extremely confrontational game, and it can in fact be a bit one dimensional because of it. When your only action can be to screw someone over, you should probably just screw over the person with the most points.

A reimplementation of Mall of Horror, which is a game I really enjoy. This is very similar, with slightly more complexity/fiddliness and for me that slightly detracts from the purity of the original. Still not a bad game but not quite as good as MoH.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There’s only one flaw in City of Horror: it’s quite repetitive, as every game makes for the same setup, the same occurrences and the same interaction among the players with just a few differences, too small to really change the way it plays. Actually most of the variations from game to game depend on five cards only (one per turn) that try to make different areas on the board more or less dangerous whilst still keeping the basic mechanics the same: on the one hand you place zombies and see whether they eat someone or not but on the other hand you still need to move one of your characters from a building to another every turn in the hope there’s a free place. It’s always the same story.

Interaction among the players is good but isn’t as high as you would think with these premises: auctions and short-termed alliances work but most of the times there’s no way to really oppose them as the other involved players simply do what’s obviously the best strategy for them, that is either bashing the leader or uniting against the weakest for a little gain.

Don’t get me wrong: I enjoy City of Horror once in a while yet I can’t but find that every game plays way too similar to any previous one, which grows quite boring soon.

Lots of interesting things going on, and the theme is extremely well integrated.  It does do the "we got this, we have lots of options" ..... "oh wait, maybe we dont, my dudes are gonna die" kind of thing, pretty well. But, in the end, the voting and back-stabbing make this not my kind of game. For those who like that kind of game, though, this is great.

A good social game, that should be more tactical. The card/antidote drops are game-deciding. Intense player interaction. I had one player that felt offended after being eaten. Needs relaxed players. Has player elimination.

In the last game I felt offended myself, because I was singled out as a target immediately in the first round (before I even did anything). I fought my way back by bribery and discussion, but it was slightly too stressful. It was exciting, but it suddenly got a somewhat negative feel to it. On the plus side I was rarely that engaged in a game ;-).

A mildly entertaining negotiation game. Deciding where to send someone each turn is always tense and funny, since you don't know where the zombies are going to appear and you can't be certain of where other players are going to move. 

I wish there were more opportunities to draw cards, because after the first couple of turns you tend to have little to negotiate with.

I brought the game from Essen and it was my biggest investment at the fair. Not only fnancially but emotionally too: i read the rulebook, watched the gameplay videos, preordered it, got the authors signature and promo card... and basically I was really enthusiastic about it.

The more it is unpleasant now to say, that I regret buying it.

During the first few games we felt like there was no real emotions on the table. Much rather: overcalculated moves and blind luck. I decided to gave this game three more runs even after I thought it was just kind of 'meh'... and well, it still is kind of 'meh' game for me. 

First of all it is very random game of blind moves. You base your strategy on a hand of cards you draw at the beginning (random or draft) and abilities of your characters (random). Come to think of it: game gives you like 5-7 cards + 4 moves (because there are 4 turns) + 3-4 characters... basically 15-20 decisions to make during the hour long game. 

And at times game really drags on (box says 45 minutes, our games tend to last twice as much). The worst moments are the movement selection phase - when players try to consider all the possibilities. And actually games encourages this "overthinking attitude", since it is really unforgiving. At times stupid move can cost you two of your characters in one round, and most of the time that cost you a victory. But you find your move "stupid" only afterwards, because you couldn't have known where the zombies will come up. I must also say it is hard to explain the game to new players, since there is a lot to take in at first - and knowing the flow of the game gives you an unfair advantage. 

The moments of backstabbing and negotiation (the selling point of the game) occur at times, but there's really not much to them - nothing more than finger pointing. To it's defense: This game is beautiful. I would say 'overproduced' really. But sadly that's not good enough for me - not why I bring my games to the table.

Like Mall of Horror but with special abilities for each of your characters, equipment cards and syringes.  Mean and back-stabby. The board sections are extremely prone to warping so spin round at the slightest provocation. During my game I turned some concave board tiles upside down to keep them still. By the end they had become concave again!

[b]Includes City of Horror -- Lawnmower promo.[/b]

City of Horror is negotiation for fans of Ameritrash and zombies. And, it's one heck of a vicious game. Players are quickly incentivized to cut deals, betray, and throw other players under the bus. You're not wheeling and dealing in commodities; you're trading who dies and who doesn't. Consequently, this game is for the thick-skinned only and those that like a ruthless game.

...but if you and your group does enjoy a ruthless one, then this game delivers. In four rounds, players definitely feel the crunch to keep their characters alive. In our first play, we used up all our action cards way too early. I'd be curious to try this one again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A social game, which I normally like.  I like the theme as well.  However, it seemed a bit too easy to "gang up" on 1 player.  Also, another criticism I have is the resource cards.  They use icons instead of titles, but the rules sometimes refer to a card as if it had a title.  Some cards also share icons with other cards as well.  It would have been much simpler to just use the titles and print the effects right on the card.

RATING: 7.5
This game is wickedly fun (emphasis on "wickedly"), but is very group dependent. If you are worried about offending/upsetting someone you're playing with then DON'T play this game with them. It will completely fall flat if you try to be nice because this game is cut-throat and that's the way it should be.

Components are great and the choice of things to do in this game are quite varied and fun.

The only reason I haven't ranked this higher is because I can't get it to the table that often, due to the restrictions on who it plays well with, how many players, length of time and rules explanation (since I only play games with 'non-gamers' and my boyfriend).

RATING: 6
City of Horror has, at its core, a wonderful mechanic that's similar to "voting people off the island." In this case, it's voting people out of the safehouse and into the waiting arms of the ravenous undead. I personally found, unfortunately, that it has a few issues in both this regard and the general, overall difficulty of the combat. A main issue might come not from the game itself, but the group of players you have: for example, a couple probably isn't going to vote each other out, and that sort of thing means you might be destined to die harsh and early before the game even starts.

This one kind of flew under the radar a bit. This one needs the right group or it can miss pretty badly. But if you have a group that will have fun throwing their buddies to the zombies and begging not to be the one thrown out next time this can be crazy fun.

RATING: 6
Likes: The mass of zombies always look intimidating. Each character's abilities are very thematic and fun.

Dislikes: It's very much more a politics/vote-off-someone-like-in-survivor type game than a zombie theme game. There's not much in terms of strategy since everything generally blows up anyway in the last round... really all about sneaking by and not catching any attention from the other players.

First play through of the game over the weekend. A bit complex for what looks to be a simple game and it's all because of the iconography.

While this fixes some of the issues w/ Mall of Horror, it hasn't caught on with our group the way MoH did.

I believe part of this is due to the characters being so different that they need a decoder sheet for the characters & play cards.

This is pretty much everything Mall of Horror should have been. It's fun, strategic, and captures the essence of the zombie apocalypse. Careful, though, it can be a friendship-ender, so make sure to play with friends who can go with the flow and shake off serious betrayal and backstabbing.

This game could be quite a bit of fun and I actually had it rated a 6 after I first played it at Essen 2012. But at the show, the given setup was explained to us so no one noticed all the errors and confusing inconsistencies of this game. It starts with funny things like the instruction to shuffle the character cards face down when all character cards are double-sided so there obviously is no face down. Okay, we can manage that. But the errors just kept on popping up. There are misprints on the game boards and/or in the rules describing them. At least one area (Armory B) shows effect symbols entirely different from what is explained in the rules. The rules also state a different number of character spaces for at least 2 game board areas (Hospital A and B). In both cases it is not clear whether the boards or the rules are correct. The rules list different victory points for at least one character card and there are was an infection cards telling us to place zombies in an area where it makes no sense at all. The symbolism on the character cards is inconsistent. For example, "The Blonde" shows her special ability only on the "rested" side when the ability is active. But for "The Pregnant Women" the special ability is shown on both sides of the card although it is only supposed to be active on the "exhausted" side according to the rules. One of the action cards simply does not have any symbols on it at all. Is it a blank / create you own card? The rules don't mention it. Those are only the obvious problems we encountered during one single game. I guess it's safe to assume that there are more errors waiting to be discovered. In the end, we spent more time discussing and interpreting rules and wondering about the mentioned problems than actually playing the game. I know that mistakes happen but so do bad ratings as a result. (This is for the Repos Production (2012) edition using the German rules included with the game.)

A very simple game which always starts off fairly pedestrian, with everyone trying to help one another, but soon ignites arguments galore as cards become sparse and alliances are forged. Definitely a game you'll be talking about for weeks afterwards.

Once the rules are down, plays fairly quickly.  I was doubtful as to how it would go with 3-players, but it actually went VERY well and even quicker.  This game can definitely suffer from spousal alliances and king-making, but overall it's a blast in the right group.

I really enjoy this game but it must be played right. If playing with bunch of PC friendly people that refuse to be cutthroat the game does not shine as much as it could.

If you are with people who will play to win it can be a really fun experience, though the dynamic of voting will not be for everybody.

There is a learning curve to this not so much based on turn phases but on abilities of each character, and understanding how they factor in to your strategy. The game does supply you with 2 cheat sheets with this info but I suggest copying up a few more.

Nice group game of betrayal. Interesting characters and mechanics. Be careful who you back-stab though because the tables can turn really quickly in the zombie apocalypse!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game is great or terrible depending who you play it with.

My first game was with a group that wouldn't back stab or try to get anyone killed. They treated the game more as a co-op. Terrible experience.

The next two plays were more interesting and there was more backstabbing and deaths going around.

I am still on the fence as to whether I like it a lot, or if it just a good game.

Would like to try it with players that have already played it a few times.

1 more try: Not really a fan of the game. If people only pick on people that are behind even to the point of just eliminating them the game is pretty bad.

Survival negotiation game. Personally i prefer lifeboat to this. At their core they are the same game and i prefer the shorter simpler format of lifeboat. However if you love zombie survival and want to vote on who gets what rations, make tactical decisions about when to hide and when to run etc and have a wad of chrome and nice components etc this is a good buy. I give it a 6 because it doesn't massively appeal to me. Its quite fast too, takes less than 2 hours.

This is not a bad game at all.  It's great!  I quite enjoy it, in fact.  However, according to BGG, the rating of 6 means that I will play it when I'm in the right mood, and that's exactly how I approach CoH.

Great artwork done by Miguel Coimbra, definitey one of my favorite artists. Similar mechanics to lifeboats, but not as good. The quality is not the best since the tiles wrap and do not stay flat on the table. Played with 6 and had a nice time. What I found more anoying of this game is the amount of symbols used on the cards.  However, after a few rounds it gets easier to deal with the symbols. You have to play with the playing aid at hand.

This really feels like a zombie game more than most.  The "screw your friends" mechanic (aka the "vote your friends off the island" mechanic) is brilliant and is at the heart of the game.  Very fun... so long as you're sure your friends won't hate you for screwing them over afterwards.

At least for our group, City of Horror succeeded where Lifeboats failed.  Lifeboats felt to mechanical while City of Horror gave the external pressures and dilemmas to fuel conflict.

It's more swingy, more lucky but it is an absolute riot and offers plenty of variation for future games.  Love this game.

Mall of horror but with character abilities ... Yes please!

My FLGS has a copy set aside for me. I didn't order it but apparently I have been a little excited and may have mentioned it once or twice :blush: Now I just have to find some way of paying for it!

Jakimaru loves me:) He bought'ed it for me :)

This is a really nice remake/reimplementation of mall of horror but it is sufficiently different to warrant keeping both on the shelf.

I am a little disappointed about the amount of negotiation taken out of this however there is still plenty of opportunity to back stab and beg and plead to try to get your way and get somebody else eaten.... if all else fails play a card or special ability!

The special abilities are nice however it is very difficult to keep a character with a draw back alive until the end. I really like the blonde screaming and drawing in extra zombies (a nod to the original mall of horror) however she is devilishly difficult to keep alive until the end. A granny not being able to move means she cannot run when the zombie horde comes-a-knocking.

Double sided boards add a large amount of re-playability and each location having an action means where you travel actually matters (in original if you weren't getting cards you were trying to get in the security office).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The game here is the other players, and City of Horror give you a perfect way to interact with them.  I really enjoy it but it needs the right crowd due to its slightly random and very 'take that' gameplay.  Not one for the Die Macher fan club.

Very fun game. Played with four friends. Me and another buddy got in the water tower from the start and sort of cooperated throughout the rest of the game, which really angered the other two players. So that was a plus for me.

This played out more decently than I was expecting it to be. Definite randomness makes this a game that relies less on strategy and more on the negotiation and fingers-crossed mechanics. However, the game really is evocative of the theme even if the special powers at most times don't really make sense. You still try to fight out the best you can, work out card combinations that will keep you alive, and plead with other people to not do anything to you that will kill you off. There are points though where a player may die off too easily (e.g., the water tower) and you have to make certain that you are never in a position to die that quickly - or you might just be out of the game! It took a long time to get the flow just right as you continually have to look up what the special symbols mean. That being said, you get it after awhile and a second game would flow much better I think. Not too much in the way of strategy of very interesting mechanics, but CoH wins on theme and a negotiation system that actually works rather well without losing itself too much in endless rule and exception lookups. I would recommend a timer is used for the negotiations, however.

It's roots in 'Mall of Horror' are clear, but it adds a wonderful tactical layer on top that makes it really stand out. More paths to victory, *many* more ways to hose your opponents...for my group it's a perfect fit.

My only gripe is that it is apparently made of the same warp-prone spongy cardboard that 'Duel in the Dark' used. Hopefully it'll settle down after being out of shrink for a while.

The best zombie game out there.
Here's your back story: A diverse group of townsfolk must survive four more hours of the zombie apocalypse before the helicopters arrive to take them to safety. All of their resources are depleted, and the only thing they have left is each other. Unfortunately, the only thing they have left to distract the hungry zombies is - each other.

DISCLAIMER: Don't play this game with people you don't know well, or with "angry" gamers. 
It will NOT. END. WELL.
 
We had two incidents in our home where players exchanged heated words, and nearly ended a friendship. Honestly, that was the most brilliant part of the game!
Those hostile interactions are practically the "meta game" in City of Horror, in that all the arguing and double-dealing going on is, very likely, exactly what would happen in the last hours of a zombie apocalypse. 
Normal, rational, ethical people begin to turn on each other, exploit each other's weaknesses, and bargain away their souls for one more hour on the planet. This is a game where a tin of food is the only thing a little girl has to offer to the priest who is about to throw her out of the water tower to be eaten by the not-so-friendly, flesh-eating parishioners.

City of Horror is funny, morally tragic, and while not perfect, it's a perfectly wicked good time.
Not to mention, good practice for any upcoming global pandemic that results in a World War Z-type run on the international human meat market.

Joc de puteig amb votacions molt divertit, amb molt "faroleig" i amb un toc d'humor en els personatges. Cada jugador porta un nombre determinat de supervivents de un holocaust Zombie que han de sobreviure uns quants torns, guanyant el jugador que ha aconseguit més punts (no tots els personatges otorguen el mateix nombre de punts, depén del valuos que sigui, en pot donar menys).

Es crema molt ràpid. Necessita mínim 5 o 6 jugadors per poderlo disfrutar al 100%, a més de que els jugadors s'impliquin i negociin entre ells.

殭屍外皮的party game，角色設計很有意思，例如生寶寶變兩票的孕婦、大屁股大媽、會隱形的超殺女，更爆笑的是使用能力才能移動、投票的阿公跟阿罵，但當抽到這兩個角色時就不好笑了...
機制上也蠻有趣，佔水塔的人可以得到較多資訊，每回合的移動跟殭屍入侵很high，地點擠不下的人只好去十字路口，用行動卡解決問題等等
但這遊戲對我來說有個大缺點：投票機制，這真的很不合理，假如真有這麼一天的到來，我想應該是槍大支的人說了算，而不是用投票...這使得原本就設計得不平衡的角色可能因此更糟糕，例如抽到阿公阿罵這種負面能力角色，被嫌棄沒啥路用乾脆去餵殭屍。後期一直在投票分物資及餵殭屍使得針對性非常強，很多遊戲都有針對性很強的缺點，這款可說是其中的佼佼者...可能有人因此玩得很upset，小心失去朋友...

I doubt I will ever get this to the table. Not a big fan of "psuedo/semi-coops" to begin with, but this game embraces "take that" more than I would like. I enjoy interaction but not direct player elimination like this game has (and promotes even), especially since the game can take 90 minutes to play. 

The game is extremely cheap online nowadays, and I might take another look at it and house-rule the elimination factor, maybe point loss or you can come back at the end of the round or something. Elimination in games is NOT fun in games that run 90-120 minutes long, plain and simple. Bang! The Dice Game is great cause it's 15 minutes, you die, boom game is over.  

Sorry Vasel, you were wrong on this one

Not really a zombie game, more of a vote for the winner, Survivor type game. Supposed to be a negotiation game but there's not even much to negotiate over, people just point to kill off someone who isn't the little girl or pregnant lady and there's not much in the way of strategy you can do to avoid it.

At least what little theme there is makes it more bearable than Lifeboats.

I don't understand the zombie craze, but a good negotiation game will always get my attention. This one just happens not to have too much negotiation in it, and it's overly finicky. Will avoid.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (November 2012)

I love zombies games AND I love Mall of Horror, so it is natural that I like this game. Perhaps I expected a little more from the game but it is a good game.

The game is now shorter with only 4 rounds and the characters have special abilities that can be used once per game, this is an improvement over the original, however I feel City of Horror has less negotiation than Mall of Horror and that’s a big negative for me. Also there are some characters that have a huge disadvantage so it is mostly luck if you get one of them and I don’t like that either, although that’s very thematic. To be clear what I don’t like is the unfairness on that account, if you get more than one character with a weakness you are screwed. To solve this (I believe), the game offers canned food with VPs which adds another layer of luck as you can only see 3 of them at a time and you don’t know what you are getting if you pick them up with the can side up. This canned food can be more important (can gives a lot of VPs) than finishing with most of your characters alive and I´m not sure I like that.

In comparison, this game is more complex (and have more luck) than Mall of Horror, but I feel this complexity detracts from the overall fun (although the voting mechanic a la Cash N Guns is pretty nice).

Also, as each player begins with 5 cards in hand it is very easy to survive many attacks (although if you don’t have the antidote that would be for naught), due to this you don’t care as much if things don’t go your way, in Mall of Horror the items were much more scarce and that was a good thing, as there are less death and less votes there is also less negotiation. 

The components are pretty good, however I would have liked miniature zombies like Mall of Horror. It is also nice the modular board offering a different experience each time you play.

There are some rules mistakes and the translation has some issues too, for example in the Spanish rules it would seem that grandma can move every time once she had used her power, but the English rules cleared that up, also in the quick guide (in every language) the grandma appears to be 5/3 when in reality she is a 5/2. Small issues all of them.

As with Mall of Horror, you need to play this with a group that don’t take very serious the backstabbing, otherwise fights between friends can (will) occur :devil:.

Bottom line, a good short game but I still prefer to play the original.

After more plays of City of Horror, I feel I’m not enjoying it very much and I’m resisting further plays. City of horror has lot more chrome than its predecessor, but for the same reason negotiation is a lot less critical in this game and that is a huge fail for me. 

I’m downgrading its rating.

RATING: 7
Great!

The negations are tight and the game pushes the players into temporary alliances with ease, just to have them at each other's throats again a moment later. Enough tools for everyone to win, but the game can end for some players really soon, and they get stuck with nothing good to do for the rest of the game (if they fail at the start). Also prone to king-making. Stays in my collection due to being shorter than Nothing Personal and can be played by up to 6.

RATING: 9
My favorite zombie themed game.  Lots of game theory at work here, as players simultaneously must chooose which spots to move their avatars to in order to stay safe and procure items.  Trouble is, everyone is usually fighting for those same spots!  Hilarity often ensues...

Add some backstabbery, potential explosions, and plenty of opportunities for verbal mexican standoffs and you have a near perfect boardgame experience.  

One thing that keeps this from being a 10 it that it is sort of cheaply made.  The board itself is warped in many copies (including the one I've played on) and some of the characters/powers are a bit lame.  Just a little more thought into the material used and into making the avatar characters less one dimensional would make this game that much better.  Second edition, perhaps?  Also, don't expect a tight strategic game here; depending on how the game goes and who sides with who and at what time, you will often lose through no fault of your own.  These minor gripes are far from disruptive, however.  In my mind, City of Horror is well on its way to becoming a classic.

A fun social experience with some interesting choices. The voting mechanic often felt underwhelming in our 4 player game. There wasn’t that much incentive to cooperate or take a lot of chances. If they added food tokens to the outer locations would help. Also, I think it would help if they had voting cards like they do in Lifeboats game.

A game which I feel the zombie apocalypse theme is reasonably matches with the mechanic of it. It has a lot of back-stabbing ,hate-voting, bluffing, and negotiating.
Just like in any apocalypse setting, doesn't matter how dirty your trick is, it will be worth it as long as you keep yourself alive.

The main flaws would be the fact that syringes item is too important in the game, while the primary way of getting it is through the hospial location. Your chances of winning will drop significantly if you do not start off with a hospital location card.

CRITIQUE OF CITY OF HORROR
Put out a game about zombies these days and it's bound to sell, even if there isn't much of a game in the box. But is there something to City of Horror? Perhaps... but not much.

CoH was a fun game to play the couple of times I played it (both on the same day). I enjoyed the scarcity of your characters' resources and the fact that spots in the buildings would fill up, leaving you stuck in the crossroads (with the zombies). But there was the start of the thematic disconnect, because being at the Crossroads wasn't always a disadvantage. In fact, being in the buildings was often worse.

This is one of the many things about CoH that made no sense. The character placement and movement rules make no sense at all, and neither does the random placement of the zombies. Zombies climbing the water tower? Really? All of these thematic blunders seem to be the result of a lackluster (or poorly tested) design.

City of Horror is a negotiation/survival game, based on reality TV (being voted out of a building is certainly a rip-off of Survivor and similar shows) as much as anything else. It's also pure Ameritrash. When your characters die, it is almost always at the hand of the other players, not the zombies. And this kind of mean-spirited social interaction can be fun in small doses, but there really isn't any more to the game than that. It's a "take that!" game with a zombie theme.

Given a group of people who are pretty thick-skinned, I'd say that the game would be crazy fun initially. Then it would be pretty fun for a few more plays... but after the new wears off they will have exhausted its potential. There isn't enough diversity or substance here to sustain many repeated plays. The characters are wildly unbalanced, the zombies are very nearly a static feature of the board (and don't act like zombies at all), and there is a huge "runaway leader" problem (with no catch-up mechanism other than playing kingmaker, which is bad design).

The graphic design of the game is exceptional, and it really draws you into the theme. It's just a shame that that theme isn't present in the gameplay, as well. In the end, CoH is only half-realized. It takes the idea of "Survivor with Zombies" and attempts to make a game out of it. But the result isn't satisfying. It's a flashy game with little substance... like every other zombie game I've played.

In Romero zombie movies, the humans are often far more villainous than zombies. In this mean spirited game, you play the humans, throwing each other to the zombies to save your own skins. Certainly a different take on the zombie theme, but actually very fitting - I love the idea, and the game can be a lot of fun.

But there are definite problems that hurt the game:
* The attempt to keep it multilingual by using just iconography means you will have to check the rule book for all your action cards.
* You'll also need to check the rule book for your character powers, because your character cards make no mention of their powers.
* There's only one rulebook in each language. With potentially 6 people all needing to look up rules for their cards and characters, it can really drag down the game.  (So I recommend making extra copies of the rules).
* For how light on strategy the game is, it's "fiddly" all around.

UPDATE:  ultimately too fiddly for what it is. I'm replacing it with the simpler, original, Mall of Horror.

City of Horror is a backstabbing survival-horror game. As in classic zombie movies, a shambling horde is invading the city. The goal is to survive the assault. (Un)fortunately, surviving often means sacrificing some of your fellow players to the undead...

Each player controls several characters with different abilities; these characters can move to various limited-capacity locations, which they can then barricade and scavenge for items and weapons. Critical situations, such as zombies breaking in and eating a character, are resolved using vote.

The basic game mechanisms are the same as in Mall of Horror.

I was really hoping this was going to take [gameid=16772] and raise it to the next level of awesomeness. But what you get, sorry for the allusion, is just an undead corpse of what made the original game such a fantastic game. What used to feel like a truly a fight for survival in a mall with hundreds of undead walking around and strangers voting to toss you to them so that they can get away safe only feels like a lot of game mechanics trying to do that. I know a lot of game players do not like luch, or dice, or choas in their games, but sometimes dammit that is exactly what you need to make a game the best it can be. [gameid=16772] excelled because it was simple concept. You start out with a band of survivors who are all worth different points. You can then get to move around board trying to find safety. If you are unfortunate enough to be located at a location that got over run there is a vote to see who gets tossed to the zombies. Rinse, repeat. It was brutal, but it was a fucking blast. What you have now is just a euro inspired, game the system, even distribution, barely has a pulse game. No thank you, I will play the original and love every second of it.

Delivers what a good game should offer.  Plenty of interaction, tense moments, alliances, rivalries, backstabbery.  Excellent stuff.  This measures right up there with Cosmic Encounter.  Not an insanely difficult game to learn but our first game was a little clunky with rules checking and timing conflicts but the second game ran a lot smoother and proved to be a lot more interesting and fun.  I would warn that this is a game that plays better with close friends that have thick skin.  Great game.  Can't wait to play it again!

A game of social politics during the Zombie Apocalypse.
You and up to five other players control a number of survivors trying to find enough vaccines while holding out until rescue arrives.
Where the game gets wonderfully nasty is when the zombies start piling up outside the differing building where the survivors are hiding out. When too many of the undead are outside a building, someone has to sacrifice themselves to save time. A by sacrifice themselves, I mean they'll have been voted and pushed out by fellow survivors.
Expect bribing, negotiating and backstabbing galore.

A great little thematic zombie game with very awesome Social Negotiation mechanics. It's all about getting victory points by grabbing the vital serum and saving your survivors, but with the zombies coming in someone is surely going to die. Your role is to maneuver yourself into a position where you will have the power of numbers to vote someone else to die. 

Its main cons are that it takes a while to setup and tear down, but that's the case with a lot of the more complex board games. Still great fun regardless, but it's not a game for everyone. The amount of backstabbing and cutthroat negotiation in this game will no doubt put off a lot of gamers. But if your group is good with it, it's hilarious fun.

Brutal game of limited resources, negotiation and back-stabbing. Tons of fun if you can handle the meanness of it, and looks great on the table.

===============
This one is a little bit too fiddly, and requires a little bit too much rules referencing (for the NUMEROUS special abilities/effects of the characters and the action cards) for what it ultimately offers. Furthermore, the negotiations, while amusing, failed to have any real BITE to them. There is seemingly too little to offer players in turns of bribes, and too little to threaten them with in terms of leverage. As such, most of the game comes down to who was lucky enough not to look like too much of a threat.

I will continue to play it, just because it's a light negotiation game that the kids enjoy, but if I want something meatier with negotiation, it will probably be something else.

Played again with kids who all felt like it was too random to do any real negotiating.

Fun game but not as good as Mall of Horror. Yes it's a different game; but as its based on Mall, it fits into the remake category.

Why isn't it as good? Well it does have more interaction but its too convoluted. Too faffy. MOH was very slick and fast flowing; COH is more complex but time consuming!

If you like screwing your friends over, then this is great fun. It's a fairly light game in which you'll help someone on one turn only to use them as a meat shield the next minute. Lots of laughs and betrayals.

played game one with light hearted fools who wanted to cooperate and save everyone - much better the second time with some bloodthirsty fellows - not as quick and fun as mall but i like it and think the potential is there for it to get more play and a higher rating
backing off the higher rating and dropping this down played it with some experienced gamers and the 1st time play for them really bogged down and did not flow well - i miss mall of horror - maybe a card that you flip to say you are doing one thing/killing zombies/using your power - the negotiation and mess just makes the game take too long

Brilliant. I just love the negotiation aspect of the game. The cards are funny and I have a lot of fun playing it. 

The rules are simple enough to get the non-gamer on board and the game plays in less than 1h.

I love games with secret card sellection... wooo it looks that you are going to be fed to the zombies... lol.... no, I use my special power card and you will be zombie chow this time :p

A quality re-implementation of Mall of Horror. The random character deal at the start can mean that you have a bit of a struggle with the weaker characters.
The game just feels a little too long for the level of r andomness and elimination to me.

I think I like this game? I really need to play it again. The presentation of this game is gorgeous, and I love how thematic everything feels. The game play though...I'm not sure about that yet. This reminds me of a slightly better version of Mob Ties, which I didn't care for, but I could see the potential for a great game there. This one does a lot of the same things, and for the most part, I think it works a lot better here. There are a few areas that concern me though. 

For one, the first player breaks ties, and certain locations only have spots for so many people. When you're vying for items at a place where there's only room for three people, and one of them is the first player, it feels like a forgone conclusion on who's going to get the items to hand out. Mob Ties is better in this respect, as any amount of people could exist on a single space. I'm not sure why they didn't allow for that to happen here. Also, there are WAY too many things going on in this game to have only included one reference sheet. Along with that, the game feels pretty long, despite only being 4 rounds. Having to resolve every location in order really breaks up the flow of the game.

City of Horror is pretty fiddly, ultimately, and while I think they got the semi-cooperative aspect mostly right here, there are still some rough edges that could have been smoothed out more. I'd like to try this one more time before I decide if I'm going to keep it or not, because I do think that this game would fill a pretty unique hole in my collection. I'm just not sure if the presentation is what is elevating my opinion or if the game really is enjoyable enough.

RATING: 5
Reviewers tricked me into believing City of Horror was a strict upgrade from Mall of Horror. This is not the case. They are pretty different games sharing the same base mechanisms.

While it tries to randomise everything in order to enhance replayability, reduce the amount of already decided votes and fix the central area hoarding strategy, City of Horror really comes across as an ameritrash redesign that adds a lot of new parts that don't really change enough to justify the increase in complexity. Most places allow you to trade a ressource for a resource, which is hardly exciting, but the mandatory vaccines make you care about these little calculations that aren't in the end as tense as deciding who gets thrown to the hungry mob - which was much more focused on in the previous game. Notably because it lasted more than 4 overly long turns. Also I really really miss the truly random dice-based zombie spawning. The hidden zombie cup built excitement. You wanted to be the security chief to look at its content.

On the components side, while I can understand why they went for a bigger and less gore thing, the water tower feels a bit cheap and the disappearance of the cool dials in favour of tiny tiny cards and finger pointing is a strict downgrade. So basically in order to have the price kept reasonable, you traded the dials for a gigantic board that hardly fits on a non-U.S. table and fulfills the same functions than Mall of Horror's which was 4 times smaller.

I'm not impressed.

This game can be intense, don't play with people who will get hurt feelings after being voted to be zombie chow by all of his or her friends.

RATING: 8
Talk about a game that has about everything I love.

It's got programmable movement, negotiation, variable character powers, a unique point system, and a game where the zombies are not the biggest threat to face man kind!

This game brings you back to why Zombie things are interesting, and not that Walking Dead crap.  Good old fashioned occult-movie stuff.

You take control of a number of characters each one with different powers that they can use through the game.  You have to survive 4 hours (4 rounds) till help comes.  Will your guys survive?  Who will you sacrifice to make it out alive?  Who will you team up with and betray to win this game?

Okay let's get to the bad stuff since there isn't much.  First off there are no miniatures, this isn't even a big deal to me, but it seems to have gotten people's panties in a bunch. The reason it makes me mad is they didn't use miniatures, but instead of going the extra mile with something else you get a game board that is thin, wobbly, and warped.  The board itself is the worst board quality I've ever seen.  I had to leave my board under a bunch of textbooks and a printer to get they to a flatness that allowed stuff to stand on them.

That's it!  The rest of this game is a gem!

The art on the crap board and the cards and everything else is great and flavorful.  People immediately become attached to their different characters and why not, they're all cliche tropes from the movies.  Like the rockstar, punk, teenager, pregnant teenager!, business man and woman, and much much more!  There's 21 characters!  That means 21 different powers!

The turns are very very simple.  Everyone selects a location they want to move in secret.  Zombies invade different places and players take turns moving one of their characters to the location.  But becareful!  If the location is full your player ends up in the crossroads, which usually ends in someone getting eaten!

Then after everyone has moved [hopefully to safety] the zombies will begin trying to assault your locations.  In order of the locations everyone resolves what they want to do.  This is where the game is located so be ready!  Players will determine if their location is overrun, if the location is [which it most likely is], then players must either kill the zombies down to a manageable level or vote someone to get the hell out of the building, thus feeding and sating the zombie fiends.  Hold onto your wallets ladies and gents because you're going to be negotiating your heart out to save your Pregnant Mom or Granny.  Players can negotiate what they own, what they may own, all sorts of different stuff just to gain their vote.  You'll see vaccinations, cans of food, and cards flying all over the place!  Then it's time to vote.  Players vote someone to basically go and die.

There's so much more though!  Depending on the rules set up before game start you can choose when and if a player can betray other players.  I highly recommend you go with the, whatever is done is done rule.  Which means make sure you get your items before the vote goes down or vice versa.  Because remember how I said I wouldn't vote for you if you'd give me a vaccination and you gave me it?  Well, I'm voting for you anyways!

Don't feel threatened by this sort of play though because this person just revealed they can't be trusted.  They had better have a good plan in their head to survive the rest of the game, because they will most likely be voted to be killed in every location from there on!

So let me tell you about my game.  I some how connived everyone to allow all my characters to live.  They all made it out, each with a vaccination.  My older brother survived with 1 person, it would of been two if my psychotic priest didn't needlessly throw 2 molotov cocktails that caused the water tower to blow up and shove my brother's Geek character to the crossroads which he was later eaten alive in!  Should I mention me and my brother teamed up right at the start?  He's lucky I let his one character live!

This is an amazing game that is incredibly simple to play.  Players will shed tears for their lost characters and they will come back with a vengeance!

Few will ever survive this game.

Delusione pazzesca. Partendo da un'ambientazione a me non gradita mi sono illuso di trovare un gioco con un minimo di strategia, almeno la possibilità di fare qualcosa… nulla, le carte decidono la sorte della partita il resto è un mostruoso king maker fatto dai compagni al tavolo. Io lo sconsiglio, ma se proprio dovete giocarci non mettetevi contro ad una bionda tettona, attirerà sicuramenti le simpatie degli altri giocatori e probabilmente vincerà, ed è bruttissimo perdere per mano di una bionda tettona!

RATING: 6
I feel that with the right group, this almost purely straight negotiation game would be quite fun. Problem is, it's not for any of the people I play with. It will probably collect dust on my shelf, unfortunately. 9/25/2013

Verdict:

What I Like: Believe it or not, there was a time when zombies were an innovative theme. If not true for this game, then surely for its direct predecessor Mall of Horror. And, despite the trend, this game focuses on what zombie themed stuff should in my opinion, the interrelationships of the survivors themselves when faced with brutal situations. The negotiation aspect of this game thematically captures this rather brilliantly. This game has great, thematic components and artwork as well.

What I Do Not Like: Initial placement of survivors is by far the most important choice in the game. Drafting cards at the beginning is essential as some are way more powerful than others, which is a fault though probably an unavoidable one. Some characters are straight up more useful than others so drafting them is necessary too. Decisions players are forced to make can often be arbitrarily mean with no in game incentive (well, the game says someone has to die now, so it might as well be you).

RATING: 7
A solidly designed 3-6 player game that heavily emphasizes inter-player negotiation, betrayal, and backstabbing through a simple voting mechanic to see who's character dies or receives much-needed "antidotes" or action cards.

If you like screwing your friends as you lie to their faces, you will probably enjoy this game! If that sounds horrible to you, then stay clear of this game!

Crazy combination of zombie shooter and voting game, with emphasis on the latter. Hmm. Make that a "Zombie runner" instead of "shooter". It contains A LOT of cool ideas, a lot of bashing and nasty twists, but fighting comes too short. No cool items. No search. No flavour text (compare that to LNoE!). I suppose it's a game for people who have played dozens of other zombie games before. Luck dependence seems pretty high to me, starting with the characters (the "Little Boy" is much better than "The Blonde", for example), followed by initial placement, start player... A good negotiator might nevertheless do well.

A great game of negotiating with your friends and trying to survive the zombie invasion.
This game has tons of player interaction, making alliances, backstabbing and all that. People are nice until their survival is at stake...then...at that point...who knows.
You work together each turn, discussing how you will handle the zombies lurking right outside the building you are in.
A vote is taken...
It's at this point you hope your alliance holds...before you become the one in the minority and are tossed out to the zombies.

A game of negotiated death. The blind movement simultaneous revelation decision invokes much collateral damage death - if you go where no one else is, you'll probably die; if you go where everyone else is, you'll be ejected into the centre of the board where chances are you'll die; if you make it somewhere safely, then chances are it'll be a negotiation to see who dies. Add in a touch of action cards which can be played whenever to help target whoever you like. So some of the damage is collateral, but most is a popularity contest - making the trick to winning being either to have a neat power on your character, not winning the meta-game much recently, or being a cute girl who the boys won't pick on. Which makes it not so much a game as an experience, and not one I much want to repeat.

Zombies randomly arrive in one of six locations and you must move around to avoid them, but the game is determined based on cards and dialog as you must get others to help you out. If there are too many zombies or items to pick up, the player that is killed and the one who gets the items is based on a vote, with one vote per character in the location. Thus by teaming up you can kill others and get items, but friendships do not last long. The mechanics are really frustrating as you determine if discussions are binding and who must act first. Almost nothing can be controlled and it just gets really annoying, plus there is player elimination which can really suck if you are sitting out early. There are much better games with this theme.

superfun sequel to Mall of Horror.  i wouldn't say it fires its predecessor, which remains a great game, but this one changes and improves on a good chunk of MoH.  the most important advance is a system that further intensifies the "survivor" aspect that makes MoH so viable.  in our game, the priest sent the granny into the maw.  the zombies might be on the outside, but the real monsters are on the inside.  a must for any MoH fan.

This one really feels like a zombie holocaust. People dying all the time, hordes roaming from place to place. Backstabbing for survival. Goods shortage. Shifts of power...

However, it feels a little bit too repetitive. The good thing is that the game's got only 4 turns, which is just about time to keep things interesting and not tiresome.

Recomended!

An interesting game with playing cards for movement along with various character powers for the survivors in your group and other miscellaneous things you can do to thin the zombie herd and survive. The ability for players to play cards and use abilities that can affect others makes the bargaining/trade mechanic a lot of fun as you will likely need help from other players, even if the "help" is for them not to target you and make a survivor die. The rules are a bit unclear and wordy which can cause confusion and the first few plays will likely be longer. Six players being able to play is also a plus for this game.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed City of Horror. It does a good job of spreading a sense of impending doom on the players and really triggers their survival instincts. When it comes right down to it, there's enough choices in the game to decide how nice or mean you want to be. A nasty player will make promises and find ways within the mechanics to break them. A nice player can be generous with their information and action cards and even win through cooperation. I like that a shared win is an option, even if it's not a fully cooperative game. Chances are each player will have at least one survivor and it will really come down to the wire on the antidote points. 

Overall: A ton of fun. Especially fun to play with different styles of players and see how the game adapts to it.

I must confess, I absolutely loathed this the first time I played it (back in 2012). There just seemed to be no fun in there at all - too much randomness and backstabbing (potential, anyway - we weren't that nasty to each other on the first play), and not much in the way of actual decisions. We also struggled with what the turn sequence was and when you could play cards and apply effects.

On a second play a week or so later (I consented on the grounds that I was told we had got several rules wrong the first time, and because I felt it couldn't possibly be quite as bad as my first impression), it indeed wasn't as bad. I can definitely see the appeal for certain groups who like to do lots of deals with each other and then potentially stab each other in the back. But, sadly, this isn't the kind of thing I enjoy much - and, aside from the politics of it all, I still see very few meaningful decisions to be made. (The game as a whole is too short, even though I'm actually glad it doesn't go on longer!)

In short, this is probably great with a group of players who really like this sort of thing - but for someone who doesn't, like me, it's boring at best and excruciating at worst.

Possibly suited as a rather lengthy and heavy party game (original theme with funny characters, possibility to play up to 6 players, nice components).

However, as a boardgame City of Horror cruelly fails due to extreme randomness.

I deeply disliked the totally disfunct 'negotiation'-mechanic, the huge luck-factor compared to the long playing time and the possilibilty for players to drop from the game before the game is over (I tend to take pity on those players which is quite problematic in a negotiation-game).

29-05-2014. Rated after about 5 plays. Fun take on the zombie-game genre, in which you play a bunch of self-preserving survivors. You know you have about 4-5 rounds before an helicopter comes to pick you up. So you try to escape with as much VPs as you can get, while you also need to have antidotes for each survivor or the helicopter won't take them.

So basically, the whole game you are trying survive by killing zombies using action cards, using the one-time special ability each of your survivors has (but reducing their VP worth) and getting medicine. All while trying to do that as cheaply as possible in order to score most VPs at the end and potentially killing your co-survivors.

With the right crowd of backstabbery people, a blast. Can completely fall flat if you play the game with the wrong crowd though.

Could have been far better. Negotiation is on thing, but when the winner in a space gets to teleport items across the map, rather than just getting first pick, there is a problem. And you can't skip the vote for item distribution even if the players in the space agree, rules force you to empower one person to be able to screw you over and then HOPE they don't warp the other items across the map. Terribly lopsided characters and the only hope of balance is a popularity contest.

I looked forward to this since I thought Mall of Horror sorely needed more powers, but this one seemed to jump the shark. Now every location has a power, every character has a power and each player starts with a fistful of cards.

The fistful of cards (but difficulty in getting more) makes this more a payment-timing game, and I do like how I can exhaust characters for an ability, but make them worth less afterward (especially since the thematic jokes are all here). Think it would've helped with the glut of powers if the character powers were more distinct from the card powers (most of them have a corresponding version), and if the character powers were less varied (say, only 3 kinds of powers, like in Mall of Horror).

Having icons instead of text for the simple powers is pretty lame.

I should like this but it hasn't come together, with games seeming to just be reactionary to random luck (all the movements seemed scripted / hard to influence), especially with the security-camera player no longer revealing his location first. Think this will go away with more plays, but ceiling-wise, I'm not too big a fan of games where I have to screw (or have to get others to screw) people even when things are equal. Bash-the-leader is fine, but bash-somebody when everybody is even (and make them hate you irrationally), or when stakes are unclear, is less palatable.

+ It looks really nice.
- Total lack of control. That makes me not care about the actions I take. There is always another special card someone has.
- None of the promised backstabbing happened. From the start small 2player teams (all the other couples) formed that didn't change all. No surprises in voting.

Made me feel like I was playing Werewolves. Which is not a good sign for me.

[i]Half-Baked Concept that Could Have Been Much More[/i]

This game is alright, but seems kinda limited in what you can do. I'm pretty clever but find negotiation leverage too limited, and bashing the leader too bean-county. But really I think there are just games I'd rather play since it demands 5+ players and 1.5-2 hours.

Also, icons over text on card abilities is annoying to me.

The game and the mechanics are extremely fun in my opinion, but those who don't like losing (and you WILL be on the losing end of a negotiation, sooner or later) or aren't keen on bargaining hard or backstabbing to win had troubles with the constant negotiation and the strategic assessment necessary not to be sacrificed to the hungry undeads. Also, the early stages of the game are spent learning the symbols on the cards and the function of the different places. 

But once everybody grasps how the game works, they are up for a fantastic ride through the most hilarious zombie apocalypse ever.

Interesting concept, somewhere between cooperation and betrayal. Good for communication & interaction, might not be the nicest talks, more filled with threats and bluffs than help and togetherness. Some surprise elements enhance the dread, for this type of game the luck factor was rather high, imo. Could have been slightly better me thinks, some fine tuning seems to be missing, some variety in possible actions. And I am not sure I am the biggest fan of this type of game anyway. I liked the characters and the look of it though. Right now I am only very mildly interested in replays, I'll see. We played with 5 which seemed to be a good number. It is a concept one should try!

Extremely thematic. The game is most enjoyable with a group that likes to roleplay a little. The gameplay mostly involves negotiation. A big potential downside is that if two players decide to form a permanent alliance (because they're in a relationship, for example), one of them will probably win, and the game won't quite work.

On the bright side, the game is good looking (though a little too oversize and overproduce for my personal taste) and the theme is extremely well integrated.

On the other side : the horror, the horror!  It's a negotiation game with arbitrary alliance and voting method.  This game will break up friendship, couples and family.  You WILL be backstab and hold a grudge.  This game is a pure exercise in frustration and should be reserved for people who like to argue (my threshold for this is very low).  It's really no better than Chinatown.

Great theme play.  Easy to learn and play.  Play is OK, some choices to make.  Game better with more players.  Components are fair - thin cardboard modular boards which significantly warped, broken plastic stand, artwork is too dark and hard to discern.  The rule book is good, in color and has examples.  Game length slightly long at about 2.5 hours.

Quite fiddly to start off with, though new players can quickly catch up due to easy to understand iconography which explains the various actions. The game can get really personal as you vote for people to feed to the zombies, though there is enough leverage you can acquire within the game through careful use of your limited pool of action cards, character abilities, and through your numbers. This allows the negotiation to be quite involved as promises of future/present favours, and calling on past actions, can also influence the votes on who to kill and who gets to distribute the supply drops.

What a shame. I don't recall thinking much of Mall of Horror and so was hoping to see an improvement here. I really don't think the card play added much here other than a layer of randomness and there remains very little space for real negotiation as the points players have, or can score, is open information and so, generally, you just simply kill the person with the most points.

What a shame.

I really loved the concept of CoH, It's yet another zombie game, but the idea is that the only way to stave off the zombie horde is to "feed" it people. Each player has a handful of characters, and when it comes down to it, there's a voting system in place where everyone in that zone has to vote on who gets eaten. Deals can be made, bargains struck, alliances forged. But in the end, only some will survive.

Problem is, despite the fun concept, the game is a clusterfuck of rules. It doesn't feel cohesive, none of the rules really gel together. It's not awful by any means, but it's not really good either. In the end, of the four people playing, one straight up disliked it, two said "Eh, it was ok" and one thought it was "kinda fun". General consensus is, while I'd be willing to give it a chance if someone else chose it, I'll probably never personally choose it on a game night again.

11/8/12 - Got my first play in and I'm interested to see how it plays with more than 4. I'm certain it will be better. I'll hold off on any ratings until I give it a couple more plays. I got it thinking it would replace Lifeboats, but I'm not so sure it will. It's almost like CoH is to Lifebotas as Shadow Hunters is to The Resistance. They're both great designs, and they share so much that one should replace the other, but because one is so much more black-and-white than the other (Lifeboats and The Resistance being the black-and-whites of each comparison), I can't get rid of one of them. I just might be keeping both in both cases.

The perfect next step from Mall of Horror. Enough changes to be a really different game. I don't know which is my favorite zombie game now, it's always been Mall of Horror, but now I have City of Horror too. 

UPDATE: After a few more plays and revisit to the Mall I think Mall is a better game overall. The additions to City were fun but ultimately kind of change the game just enough to make it not as fun.

Some chance of raising this to 6.5 after a second play (someday).

Components are bad. Warped boards and cards, and takes up a ton of space (nine boards, three of which you shouldn't really need). I like the nicely drawn characters on colored stands, but the zombies are pretty uninspiring.

My major headache with this game is the action cards and character abilities and location abilities that I kept needing to check. The rules don't mention any in context (most annoyingly with the fact that the blonde girl needs to draw an extra zombie to her location each turn), placing everything in an appendix. And most abilities are of the "do this whenever you want" sort which is such a pain to keep track of and accomodate.

I also dislike all the abilities that don't even need to be used where you have a character. I guess that encourages more negotiation but thematically it doesn't make much sense.

In comparison to Mall of Horror, things are more complicated (see above...), the game seems short (four turns) and less bloody (I saw only 5 out of 18 characters die), and the players are given some responsibility and ability to kill off zombies themselves (since they don't run away after eating anymore).

Another way that the game is more complicated is that there are antidotes that you need to collect: one for each of your characters who survives. These didn't turn out to be that hard to get, but it is pretty hard to PLAN to get them. Usually you're just trying to move wherever you can minimize the odds of losing a guy.

I do like that at the Crossroads (the place you go if your destination was full) zombie kills are are determined by a (partly manipulable) rondel instead of by vote. But supplies are not distributed from there anymore, so the old MoH Parking Lot strategy is doubly (redundantly) solved.

So, you never vote at the Crossroads, and tons of people end up getting dumped there. And unless I misread the rules, only four people total can get killed there over the course of the game. This certainly contributes to my feeling that there was a lot less voting in CoH compared to MoH.

And I also did like the idea of antidotes and food cans: Things to contribute to your score aside from just which characters survive.

I think my bottom line is that there are some decent ideas here, but the balance of mechanisms seems messed up (after one play), and making the special abilities more tolerable to me would be quite a bit of work.

Not as good as the original it was based upon (i.e. Mall Of Horror). Its still a negotation game at its heart, but City Of Horror adds lots of unnecessary chrome, mostly resulting in more chaos, more take that card actions and more randomness. People who do not like negotation may find this more to their liking than the original, as long as they do not mind a lengthy explanation of the rules and icons. The artwork of the game is very nice, too bad the component quality is not (warping boards, cardboard zombies). Would not mind playing this every now and then, but cannot see myself asking for it.

Now, I have only played this game once, but it was fantastic. It's a bit complicated to grasp at first, but once you play it it's actually really simple. The area control portion of the game is fun and each character is fun to play with (you to get use multiple characters). However, this game really shines in the fact that it is an excellent zombie survival simulation. By this I mean that I actually feel like I'm in a zombie apocalypse. I'm making shaky alliances with other players and I'll quickly turn on them when it most benefits me. You can never play a game where everybody makes it and you are helplessly outnumbered. Setup is a bit intense and it isn't a quick play, but wow do I like it.

My first game was a bit flat, but I couldn't get the other people that I know are fun to play this sort of game with.  I can definitely see the potential with more players who are more animated and ready to make deals for everything.  I expect my rating to go up with further plays.

One of the guys at the table called it "Gamer Musical Chairs" and that's a pretty apt synopsis.  Who is trading positions with who, who guessed their opponents actions correctly, and who can weasel their way out of trouble the best.

well, it's definitely the most fun zombie game in the market. it grasp the theme very well, the tension of surviving the apocalypse is there. The mechanics works perfectly to simulate that feel.

The play time was decent and reasonable. we didn't feel the game overstay its welcome. setting up and storing is quite fast too.

The quality is nice, but my board got a little bit warped, but nothing as horrible as others.

Player interaction was lively and fun. There's a lot of it because the mechanics really encourage players to negotiate everything. Everything in good fun atmosphere. Nothing nasty and no hard feeling

the problem is in teaching the game to new players (and learning the game for myself). it's not that the game itself is complex, it's just the amount of iconography built within the game is borderline stupid. 

a lot of these icons only representing one or two VERY short line of text. that definitely don't need an icon.

then in learning game session, players spent majority of their time checking the meaning of the icon, and it is very disruptive to the game flow.

it cut cost at the cost of customer satisfaction. very stupid.

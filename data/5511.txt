RATING: 8
Interesting situation in the Balkans. Replayability is good due to variable involvement of some minor countries.

Game 2 in the Third World War series. This is a very different game from the first one, as most of the forces involved are the 'second string', both in terms of equipment and capability. The rugged terrain of the Balkans and Turkey severely limit room for manuoevre by conventional forces, expanding the opportunities for the use of amphibious and airmobile troops to bypass / envelop front lines. However, if these troops aren't used correctly, then either or both sides can end up with a long, slow grind to their objectives.
As the subtitle (Race for the Straits) indicates, the game boils down to the battle for the Turkish Straits. This is a good game, probably not best played as a stand-alone, but adds so much when linked to Third World War and Arctic Front.

First one of the series I came across and still great fun.  Have played it stand-alone, combined with PG (great for putting the squeeze on Turkey from both ends), combined with TWW and currently playing all four together.  Not sure about the balance - if NATO know what they're doing it's almost impossible for the PACT to open the Straits (haven't seen this done since our group were novices).

RATING: 9
A great and challenging game. Sequence of play has to be carefully followed the first couple of times, until it becomes familiar.

RATING: 7.5
Part of GDW's 3rd WW series. Very much a Europa look but this module has small unit count and looks like an interesting and rarely simulated theatre.

Started a game of this. Intriguing system, takes a while to get the play sequence down pat, but then quite quick playing.

One of my very best gaming experiences. Superb system. Superb play and replay value. Best game was 3WW + SF. (Arctic Front took too much space and not enough action, and Persian Gulf irrelevant to classic mid-late 70's/early 80's time frame.) Pact broke thru Yugo into Po Valley, raced almost to Milan, but there the Eye-Ties dug in and Pact ran out of steam. Central Front was also a nail-bitter with my NATO air rolling endless 6's giving Pact chance to drive dangerously deep into GY, but finally Pact stalled there, too. But what a hoot to play. Have also played Southern Front alone many times, short(ish)playable, violent, great for aging grognards. I was in SETAF '83-'85, so defending the straits in "Display Determination" gave game added meaning/context.  In short, one of best game systems ever.

Not as fluid as the Third World War game.  The push into the Balkans must be done quickly by the Pact player, otherwise it gets into a grind it out type of conflict.

A lower counter density than the sister game The Third World War.  This game plays quicky and produces some tight results.  At times the NATO player feel impotent as the PACT players steamroller gets up to speed. 

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

The Balkan aspect to the TWW series is interesting to play as the Soviets have a major decision to make initially on where to make their thrust. Do they go all-out for the Turkish straits or go elsewhere? Lower counter density than the central Europe game means its quicker to play, but it also fits in well as part of the combined game.

Adds in another side show to the main events in Western Europe and the Persian Gulf, like the Arctic Front there simply isn't much points to be had here, but those that are here are still to valuable to lose.  This game in the combine 4 game campaign is where NATO have the chance to go on the offensive, especially in the Balkan detente scenario, where the Soviets lose Romania and gain Albania (a far poorer country). 

Even with the smaller scope, it still adds an interesting strategic situation to the overall campaign game.

The best follow up game to Third World War.  Persian Gulf is a close second.
The Balkan region lends itself well to several user defined variants like a Balkan war not involving superpowers, or a Greek-Turkish war.
Definitely has replayability qualities.

Good: Strategic/Operational - WW III - Medium

Plus:
-Same great system as the mother game
-Great what if situation

Minus:
-As stand alone okay, as extension of the main game it's great

Nice addition to the main game but as stand alone not as interesting as the battle for Germany but still a great what if situation!

Sold it.

A great hex and counter game from a time well before I entered the hobby. The air system is great and overall rules complexity is low. Ultimately an interesting system and game. One oddity for an operational level game is the lack of supply rules.

GDW's "Third World War" series game.  Southern Front is actually a simulation on the Balkan Front, where Soviet backed Balkan allies confronted with NATO members Turkey and Greece, with the "independent" Yugoslavia.  What the designer cannot anticipated, however, is that Yougoslavia now gone. Warsaw Pact now gone.

Worthwhile addition to the series, probably best after the Central Front game. Many strategies, and the force density that the system requires. Of course the question of control of the Straits is central, making much of the game a bit of a sideshow in geopolitical terms.

RATING: 10
While the light forces battle in Norway and the massed hig quality tank formations duel for Germany here the players control an assortment of lessere quality units from "minor" partners of the two alliances. Still the sitatuion is tense beacuse the prize is big (the opening of the turkish straits). More often than  not, when playing the combineda game reinforcements are diverted from other teathers to bloster the faltering offesives (or crumbling defenses) in the Istanbul area. Another sure it in my collection.

A down-side to having a large gaming table and a large gaming group is that one almost always plays monster games and misses out on smaller gems. This is such a game. An unusual turn structure sees the Soviet player slowly grow weaker yet, with care, having the ability to sustain an attack. Unfortunately I only have this one game in the series. My ongoing hope is to buy the three other games and put them together and get the group to play them!

Good to play with Battle for Germany (or even just Austria southwards) as the Pact gets to decide whether to prioritise the (almost unwinnable) battle for the straits, or instead send more troops to Italy and see if you can sack Rome.

Prob best played in combination with other modules.  Don't see the need for the Pact to mess with Yugoslavia if they can cordon the northern portion and move into Italy.  Opening the Straights does not seem to pay off in VPs for the effort required either.

TWW series is the best modern wargame series I know and this is probably the most interesting individual game. Soviet and Bulgarian/Romanian troops try to take Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey and invariably end up over-stretched. There are other variations like Romania changing sides and extra Soviet Airborne troops.

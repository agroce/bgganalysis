This didn't set too well with me.  The decisions you get to make are not that interesting, compared to a [b]Pandemic[/b]/[b]Forbidden Island[/b]/[b]Lord of the Rings[/b].  (It does take a lot to get me excited about a cooperative game these days.)  The art and figures are quite nice, of course.

2012. Full co-op. Deck-builder?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very tense co-op deck builder! Has some of the most amazing components ever! The rule book isn't the clearest, but once you've played a few rounds you'll get it. Very glad to own this Fragor beast! The box sides on the ridiculous for size but that's a little nitpicky.

Big, beautiful game with a really interesting theme.  I think they could have done more with the deckbuilding aspect, though.

RATING: 7.5
This is a game whose heft factor goes off the scale - the components are exceptional, the board enormous and the visual effect stunning. When you see the size of the box, the only rational conclusion is that it's overdone and must be mostly empty; stunningly, it proves to be packed with goodies. This is a recession-busting production par excellence. What's more, it's a very decent cooperative deck-building game - the first of its kind? - with a few nice new touches that you won't have seen before. 

We played this quite a few times in playtesting, to quite a few different rulesets, including with the difficulty ramped way up, so we were confident; too confident as it turns out - even on normal difficulty the witch won on turn four or thereabouts ... though next turn we would have ... let's just say that you need to be prepared to struggle before you're going to win.

RATING: 6
[floatright][imageid=1455885][/floatright][size=11][b][thing=130295][/thing][/size][/b] is every bit as adorable a production as the early comments have indicated.  The craftsmanship of the game pieces really do justify the game's hefty price tag.  As I was being read the rules, I found myself becoming increasingly enamored with the marriage between narrative and mechanics.  The game seemed highly promising.

Then we played.  

[thing=130295][/thing] turned out to be a perfectly fine game, but it did not quite live up to the lofty experience promised by the rules and production values.  The game's problems (such as they are) are two-fold:  

[floatleft][imageid=1453664][/floatleft]First, the game's simplicity is in tension with my desire to experience a sufficiently textured game world.  For example, players seek to rescue five spellbooks that move along individual paths, but the paths are identical (or nearly).  Saving the red spellbook requires the exact same types of actions as saving the yellow spellbook, and results in the exactly the same effects.  I would have loved for each book to have some personality that informed players' strategies.  Likewise, players can recruit assistance from allies in the game, but (for the most part) the contributions of these allies are rather generic.  Moreover, the game seems to incentivize accumulating as many allies as possible (regardless of contributions), so we felt little need to distinguish among them.  

[floatright][imageid=1451955][/floatright]Second, several of the game's rules are technical and unintuitive (given the implementation), which led to us consulting the rulebook with a greater frequency than I would have wanted.  The primary downside of this is not simply the time wasted with our nose in the rules, but rather the fact that players cannot make informed strategic decisions without understanding these technicalities.  Perhaps this issue will clear up with sufficient experience, but its impediment to my enjoyment makes repeated plays less likely than they might have been otherwise. 

At the end of the day, [thing=130295][/thing] is roughly on par with [thing=30549][/thing] in the world of cooperative games.  It is fairly dry and mechanical excersize in moving around a board slowly pushing toward an ultimate resolution.  It is fully cooperative (all information is shared), so there is really no attempt to circumvent the potential of a bossy know-it-all to ruin your fun.  The game does enough things well, and with enough novelty, that I intend to try it out several more times before I make a final decision about it.  But, unless the re-sale market tanks, I suspect that this title won't hold my interest long enough to counteract the opportunity cost in holding onto it.

A really wasted opportunity here.  The game itself is not bad, and looks to me like the skeleton framework of a decent game.  But all the characters are interchangeable - there's no reason to have one player do something that another can do, except for place in the turn order.  And the locations themselves are the same.  There is no reason to push red instead of blue if they are equally positioned, and there really needs to be for the game to play differently.  All in all, it just feels very samey.  The saving grace are the heroes/mercenaries, which do add some small bit of flavor.

Short version:
This is the definition of over-produced. You've got gigantic and amazing figurines that serve no purpose but to be cool looking, and they are propping up what is - if people are honest and willing to look past the decorations- a subpar game with little replayability and not many interesting decisions. A game like this absolutely needed variable powers and effects for the characters and spell books to shine and they simply left it all out. Seems to me they are banking on the beauty of the game being enough to make it sell in spite of the lack of game in the box. They are probably right so I can't fault them. Definitely not for me.

Played the prototype in two versions - one from April/May, one from the final rules. Great additions / deletions / changes made. Different engines, some of them "race-like" against timing and the game's apparatus, combined to a tough-decision-coop, as it should be. Feels very good, even without final components. More "gamer's game" than Poseidon`s Kingdom.

My rating of 7 is completely amiss since I have yet to play the game.  I gobble up every Lamont Bros game because I love the components--this is the best one ever.  Yes, I care how the game plays, but even if I think the play is average I won't be lowering my rating because playing with these components gives the game a 7.  Out of the thousands of games (around 4000) I have owned over time (long time), this is the only game I have ever pre-rated.  It is one of my more expensive, stand alone games($135), but worth it.

I might also add that, although I have never been disappointed with game play in their other games, the strong point of the Lamont Bros games has always been components and humor.

Spellbound got me completely spellbound. ;-) This game just looks amazing. I spent about 20 minutes just admiring the box (mine's even got the Lamonts' signatures). :-)

So far we always lost, but it's a lot of fun anyway. 

Setup takes a while and I think the rules are a little chaotic. Also, I'd like replacements for the hats because they don't fit to the rest of the material at all. 
They look as if the other "miniatures" (they really aren't mini) were so expensive that there wasn't enough money in the budget to make nice hats as well. xD

A lot of the rules are technical, and the text on the cards doesn't read very intuitive.

This combined with the fact that there's no private information for each player (like in Pandemic) or a time limit (Space Alert), the potential for one player dictating (=always giving the best advice) is certainly present.

The artwork/font on the cards looks amateurishly.  It certainly doesn't live up to the lovely, but way oversized, models.

Family game. Many rules but not difficult to teach. Mechanics work quite well and are a good introduction to deck-building for casual players.

Judged gameplay-wise, Spellbound is heavily overpriced. It's an ok cooperative game that's very processional. The deckbuilding part is more an afterthought that just happens as players try to make the best out of their dealt hand of cards. Either it works out or it doesn't. Random setup and distribution probably are more important than skill.
Nonetheless, Spellbound is entertaining. Although I don't like the overloaded art design, playing with the huge miniatures is a strangely satisfying experience. The game material succeeds in telling a story where the processional mechanisms alone would have failed. Each turn a new puzzle has to be solved with enough options to satisfy on a tactical level and compensating for the lack of long-term planning options.
Spellbound will stay in my collection as a playable collector's item. If it were a more ordinary implementation, I'd rather play better cooperative games.

Essen 2012 pick-up, signed copy, it's very big.

If this game didn't look as good as it does then my rating would be lower. There is a good game to be played here but many of the decisions are fairly obvious.

However, I do think the combination of mechanics lifted from other games works well and (after a bit of fiddly-ness during set up which involves sorting out the right cards to use in the Destiny Deck) it plays fairly quickly and enjoyably.

The official variants to make the game harder (as well as some other ones posted here on BGG) will make their debut earlier rather than later to increase the difficulty.

Look, I'm sure there are some people who are spellbound by the goofy pieces, but I'm not really into the whole lawn-gnome look - to me, the pieces look schmaltzy, and despite their weight, they didn't make up for the absolutely paltry amount of game here. We called it after a few rounds because it was so tedious that we couldn't really take it anymore. This would make a decent introduction to cooperative games for your eight-year-old if it weren't so boring, but what adult is going to want to put themselves through a mawkish, multi-timered race game like this more than once? 

With all due respect for the designers and developers, this struck me as half-baked, and even the graphic design was pretty bad if you look beyond the pieces. I hope Fragor's next effort (if you can call this one of those) improves on the gameplay and cuts down on the fat.

When you say cooperative deckbuilding, one would normally expect a conventional melding of "Dominion" with "Pandemic".  So, it came as a big surprise when the deckbuilding portion of "Spellbound" turned out to be cooperative.  That's right.  There's one deck for all of the players to use.  It works much better than you would think and makes for rather cool twists in gameplay.

Another great game from the Lamont Brothers.  

There is one lingering question.  Is it a $120.00 dollars good?  That remains to be answered.

While beautifully produced with some hefty figurines, I'm not convinced this piece of art stands up to return plays very often.  I do wish the Fragor brothers would have made each of the book tracks a bit different to mix up things, but the only thing that will change from game to game are the allies that will become available.  There was some confusion in our first play about what happened when there were three witches in the display versus actual confrontation with the witch when we ran out of cards for the display.  Although not nearly as beautifully produced, I would likely rather play Pandemic or Flashpoint in the same time frame.

Perhaps my favorite Lamont Brothers game.  Not for the gameplay, as Snow Tails may have that, but the merging of the theme with the production.  This was one of the first of their games where the little figures really spoke to me and invested me in the world of the game.  Luxurious figurines (my favorite being the silver book), wonderful board.  The gameplay nothing special, but fits exceedingly well with the artwork and whimsical nature of the sculpts, and I'm not one to be taken in by components much.  One of the few games from them I would play several times just to enjoy the surroundings of the game.

A fairly simple but tough to beat co-op, where you control mages fighting off the dark witch. You must advance your spell books to ear new spells and ensure the dark witch does not destroy them, while at the same time recruiting new allies to help you in your battle, which is done in a co-op deck building style. Although the game is over produced and the box is huge, it is nice and turns heads. Not as easy as you may think and plays fast and keeps everyone involved.

The artwork and components are really delightful. A pity that the hat pieces are in wood instead of resin, now they just doens't seem to fit into the bigger picture.

The game itself: 2 solo-plays only so far. Lost 1 and won one (but close to losing). All mechanics work well together. Putting as many good cards (= allies) into your deck, seems to be the key to win.

First, I was less than impressed with the quality of the paint job on the various pieces - It was very sloppy

I have to be honest, I have not played - and that is partially because I am embarassed to pull it out and have others see how poorly the minis are painted - especially given how much money this cost me.

RATING: 6
This is a decent pseudo-deck builder with some unnecessarily over-the-top components, which legitimately hurts the game in a number of ways.

The game itself is enjoyable.  It is a cooperative game where both players share a central deck of cards.  There are good cards and bad cards in this deck.  Every round more bad cards are added and the players can take actions to add more good cards to the deck as well to even it out.  There is also a board where the players move their pieces and what the cards do changes depending on where the players are located.  The players are attempting to collect 4 of 5 spell books to start the final battle and also become powerful enough during the course of the game to win the final battle.

Like I said, it's enjoyable but it also isn't really anything new.  Which is probably why Fragor went so overboard with the components but, at least for me, that puts me more off rather than draw me in.

First of all, this is really a pretty small deck-builder, less than 100 cards total I think, yet the box is gigantic and with those figures in it weighs a ton.  The ceramic figures themselves are also very fragile and the game doesn't come with a good way to store them securely/safely, this combined with the unwieldiness of the game makes it difficult to play anywhere else but in the safety of your own home with very careful adults (especially since considering the small print run and price of the game if you had a copy you probably put yourself out a bit to get it).

But that's not even where it ends.  The pieces barely fit on the board spaces, an outrageously large board to begin with likely in an attempt to accommodate these gigantic pieces.  They also, and again this is just my opinion, aren't even very pretty pieces.  They have this ugly melty look to them with lots of rough limes and seams from the mold.  Again, if you are going to go this overboard why not do your best.  And the final insult is of course with all the enormous over-the-top pieces included in the game they didn't include witch hats, a major component of the game!  How is that acceptable?

Like I said, reasonably enjoyable and I know someone who has a second-hand copy (which he got cheap because it did get so banged up) so I have an opportunity to play it but I would never buy this for myself.  It's not worth the shelf space and the hassle.

Got a copy at Essen 2012. Played it several times and it is a fun game. It - of course - has gorgeous components (which it should, because of a hefty price tag of ‚Ç¨60,-), but it also is a very decent coop title.

Theme is a big plus for me, and its accessibility and hence, chance it does get played with my wife, is a great thumbs up!

[EDIT 2014] Re-rated my game from 7 to 6 as it simply never does get playtime, nor is asked for. It still is a thing of beauty to behold, and a decent coop. But it's simply not enough of a game to keep me interested above Pandemic + expansions (still the epitome of coop in my book), Arkham Horror (my solo 'coop' game of choice because of atmosphere) or even Flash Point (decent thematic, but light and hence also on trade) or Defenders of the Realm (only so-so, but varied enough to get replay and mainly around by virtue of the big pile of extra goodies coming in from the KS campaign on it).

Took this out a while ago to show to someone interested in my gaming collection and thought to myself 'whoa! Am I a gamer or a collector?' 

I'm a gamer. The game in this can simply not compete with its competition. Though it will be a pain to see all this gorgeous chrome go. Because man, does it look nice. And that's playable nice, as well. Very hesitant to trade/sell this away.

This reminds me a lot of Knizia's Lord of the Rings, though you can add 'good' cards to the events pile and the production value is clearly leagues apart.

Spellbound certainly looks impressive, especially if you like the Scottish souvenirshop style of the figurines. The artwork on the board and cards, although very different from each other, is also remarkably better than the artwork of previous Fragor releases. Compared to the quality of the components, the game itself was a bit of a let down for me. I am not a huge fan of co-op games, but this one felt more mechanical than most. It does not have the engrossing theme of Flash Point, the puzzle-like gameplay of Pandemic or the frantic gameplay of Ghost Stories. We lost our first game in the first round, and won our second without any tense moments. In addition to that, the fact that all players build a central deck makes the amount of decisions you can make feel limited, as other players offer their ideas, and the situation on the board dictates only one or two best options. Would not mind playing the game again, but have no desire to.

I really enjoyed my first play of this game, even through making a few mistakes and losing quickly.  The board and figures are wonderful to look at.  See my full review on the game page.

A fun game, but I wish there was a bit more diversity in what you chose to do.  We didn't head to the villages too often (except to use the Fortuna card) and didn't enlist the help of any allies other than the pixies to defeat Baba Yaga. However, we had the Fortuna and Witch's House cards and only expensive allies come out at the beginning of the game.

Solid coop with a deck building mechanic. The game itself is solid 7 material but the figures are over-the-top awesome. They didn't mean for them to be that large when the manufacturing was set but after seeing them they decided to stay with that size and increase the box size to accommodate them. I give it an extra full point for the component quality.

Find the spellbooks that contain the powerful spell to banish the witch Baba Yaga. A co-op deck builder with fantastic production quality and ridiculously cool character figures.

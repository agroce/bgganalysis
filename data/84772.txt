Sun, Sea and Sand has good fidelity to its theme, from tubby meeples heading for the bar, to chalets erected as their occupants are signing the register and wandering backpackers who may end up sleeping on the beach.  

It's a worker placement game, whose twist is that tasks take differing amounts of time.  Focus too heavily on large scale developments to your resort and you may find yourself short of staff to meet those all important tourists at the boat.  Beyond that, there isn't a great deal to interest a gamer.  I share the concerns of other commenters about the absence of game to game variability.

Production quality is good.  I particularly liked the real shell, used as a first player marker and the meeples of differing girths.  The artwork is quite pleasing too.

Essen 2010.  A predictable Corné van Moorsel, Christof Tisch look and feel.  Clever medium weight game that Corné specialises in.  Happy to add this to my Cwali collection.  Quite engaging.  Doesn't outlive its welcome.  A little more than a filler bit not the main course.

Átlagos worker placement, néhány jó ötlettel, és POCSÉK KIVITELBEN!!! Ami tetszett, hogy nagyon életszerű, tematikus: a különféle emberek (sovány, kövér, sportos...) más-más létesítményekre buknak típusuknak megfelelően. A hátizsákos turisták ötlete is jó, kár hogy szinte mindig 1-2 mezőt mozognak, így nem nagyon jut szerephez az egész... És a legjobb, ami feldobja a játékot, az az előjegyzések szerepe. Enélkül egy nagyon egyszerű és unalmas kis játék lenne, ez eléggé megbonyolítja, mélységet ad neki. Az hogy a hét végén kit hogy kell elszállásolni, kinek kell hazamenni, az kicsit erőltetett, de összességében az egész  játék nem rossz. Sok jobb van, de nem bánom, hogy kipróbáltam.

The theme of this game is fresh like the wind of the sea blowing in your face while you roast on a sunny subtropical beach: you're the head of a family who runs a resort and is looking for rich tourists.
It's a (light-)medium weight euro game with clever and innovative mechanics: it's a worker placement game where your workers are bound for several turns if they perform more difficult actions. Overall, the game is quite different from any other game I've tried, and it plays fast: it surely deserves a few more plays! The only question mark comes from replayability: is there sufficient variability to mantain interest?

First Play: Rules are only 4 pages and quite clear, but do take careful reading to pick out details.

This is a very clever game. Carefully balanced to scale for player numbers, once the basics are grasped the game whips along to be finished comfortably in the prescribed hour.  

Half way through it became apparent how important the pace and momentum of the game is. Its crucial to see and grab compatible groupings of tourists on future ships and to not be left short of family members when important acquisitions are required. As ever with a well balanced game there are never enough actions nor enough money to do what you want.


Second Play: Rating increased 7.5-8.0. This really is a very well balanced and subtle game.

Cute theme, at least something really different from typical noble family trying to earn the king's favour.

This is the main trademark from its author, Corné Van Moorsel, original themes.

Sun, Sea & Sand is a nice game, with family mechanics, maybe the game choices are too constrained and allows little choices to gamers, but non gamers can have a good time playing this game.

I like the concept of the boats arriving and pleasing different colors of meeples.  Ultimately there just didn't feel like enough to do in the game.  It'd be neat if the backpackers were more numerous, even to the point of them blocking the guests that you really want to attract.

A worker placement game.....  yeah, another.  

I like the vacationy theme, but was pretty unimpressed by the variation in what you can do.   Everyone (as long as they don't make a major placement blunder) should end up with about the same score no matter what they do.

So, not a game I dislike, but not one I'd want to own either.

RATING: 7
Another very unique and fun game from Cwali!  You need huts to house vacationers in, employees to go out and gather up people to lead to your resort, attractions to keep vacationers at your resort longer (thus earning you more money to spend on more huts and attractions).  Further more, each of these things takes a certain amount of time, so you don't get your actions back until that time has elapsed.

Overall, a pretty cool planning game with a very tight economy, which makes every decision rather difficult.  Also plays rather quickly, so the game packs a real punch in a short amount of time.

Not bad! Worker placement game that plays quickly and offers some interesting decisions. The meeples are actually a source of income (and points at the end), but the actions you choose involve increasing capacity for meeples, building buildings to keep meeples longer on your board and score points, and grabbing meeples off the boat.

I'm not sure it's a gateway game, and consequently it's not something I need in my collection, but I'd happily play it again.

I look upon Sun, Sea & Sand in two distinct ways. The first way is by ignoring who made it. Then I am faced with a subject-wise cute game with little needless embellishments which, apart from the somewhat odd backpacker element, works as you would expect it to. It does not comtain complex game patterns and may feel simplistic, even somewhat dated, but it has a pleasing rhythm to it which should hold up over at least a couple of plays. The worker-time-placement leads to a bit of q quirked eyebrow when you really think about what is depicted in the game and what actually happens, but apart from that it forces players to plan ahead in a natural way. All in all it's not a super game, but there's nothing really bad about it either.

Then uncover the name of the author: Corné van Moorsel. I'm never quite sure where I stand with this author. Most of his games are... well, lacking in ways which are sometimes hard to describe. However from time to time he makes something which stands out from the rest of his oeuvre. Sun, Sea & Sand is such a title. It doesn't feel ‘clunky’, it plays smoothly (even intuitively), and the artwork's nice and bright, even if the cardboard is a little small and fidgety at times. For a Dutch design this is an excellent job, well done! (And please, no jokes about where it leaves this country as whole.)

Sun, Sea, and Sand was the third of the delightful lighter games that surprised me at BGG.Con and perhaps my favorite. Designed and published by Cwali, this one was completely off my radar until it started to do well during BGG.Con. Coincidentally, one of my geekbuddies checked the game out at the exact same time as I noticed this, so we got to play it soon afterward. Unfortunately, this was late enough in the convention that I was unable to secure a copy, but I have every intention to do so as soon as it is available again.

The thematic conceit behind Sun, Sea, and Sand is that you are managing a resort at small island just at the start of tourist season. You have to use your family to bring in guests, build up your resort, and generally do the sorts of things that you expect workers to do in worker placement games. The big difference is that, in doing so, you give up your workers for anywhere between 1 and 6 turns, thus decreasing the number of workers that are available for actions on the following turns. Money is also an issue, which can only be corrected by having tourists stay in your hotel. Attractions increase your victory points at the end of the game and also cause tourists to stay longer. The more attractions you have that cater to one of the four types of tourists, the longer that type of tourist will stay, and by having tourists stay longer you have a greater capability to use your actions for other activities that increase your victory points or the amount of tourists that visit and thus your resort’s income. There are a number of other nuances to the rules, including the presence of backpackers and signs to attract them, but they are only secondary to the main areas of my attraction to the game.

This game is pretty much my ideal in lighter worker placement/action point games. The decisions are tough, the structure is innovative, and the game only vaguely feels like any other game I’ve tried. This one is a winner.

Edit: Further play has hilighted that there really is very little interplay variability and, while interaction is present in the form of competition for less expensive resort options and tourists, that is not sufficient to maintain my attention. The fact that I have won all of my games does not help either, as I am finding myself slightly bored with the game. Gone.

There’s a nice time element with “recruiting” people to visit your resort (and get money) along with maximizing your purchases. Purchases cost time and money (your workers are out of action for as long as it takes to complete their actions just like in Thebes and Tinners Trail), and both money and time are extremely tight in this game.  The ultra-thin cardboard components are kinda crappy.

I have a feeling the path to victory will always be the same -- get red guys b/c they get extra money at the bar, build up your income, tack on the signage to attract backpackers at the end, get a big end game VP tile. I just don't see why you wouldn't do that strategy every single game. I was hoping for more of an angle from the backpacker, but that seems like an add-on rather than a strategic path.

Slightly over-produced and fiddly, but we enjoyed this worker placement game a lot. Towards the end of the game, there were fewer things to do, so workers got wasted, which seemed a shame. But the overall flow and theme of the game worked very well. I'd like to play again, and with more players. The use of time, and especially being able to pre-book tourists was novel, and the tight money supply was good.

Please note, the meeples are different shapes according to their desires!

In Sun, Sea & Sand players are managing a holiday resort. Many actions bind workers for several turns, which makes it unusually strategic for such a short game. Some of the implementation details seem a little clunky and tacked on (the backpackers, in particular) but overall it does what you'd expect it to.

What I'm not so sure about is replayability. The only thing that changes from game to game is the order and configuration of the tourist barges arriving at the island, but since there is little differentiation between the different tourists and/or attractions that doesn't really change the game much except for short-term considerations.

Kleines, feines Taktikspiel, dessen Mechanismen sich stimmig ins Thema fügen. Spielt sich für ein  Optimierungsspiel fast schon sommerlich leicht und loungig.

The game looks a little cartoon like, but there is a lot of game in there. The systems within the game work very well and the game feels very balance. The game's 'board' is clever in its design with nice scaling systems for the number of players playing. This is the type of game where careful planning for the last round is very important, so keep your eye on the finish-line and you'll do well.

This is likely to be my favorite game to come out of the Essen-Spiel crop of 2010.

Simply, one of the most fun I've had in a long time.

What looks like it should be a simple worker placement game, turns out to have a lot going on. While there is a bit of a scripted opening, we've seen in out first couple games some variation after turn one. With some interesting choices.

I've never thought of Cwali as 'top notch' in game quality, but I was a bit disappointed in the quality only in that the 'main board' has a small flap that folds out from the board. The board being fairly thin with this folding piece looks like it may 'break off' easily. If they wouldn't have made it fold (or made it two pieces) I don't think I would have noticed how thin the board is.

The game really made me realize though, that I think I may like their games. I own 5 of their games (although only have played 4 of them). Of those four I rate them 5, 7, 8.5 and 9.

I went back and revisted my 8.5 rating of Basketboss and brought it up to a 9. In 2010 I only rated 2 games a 9 and in 2009 only one.

I've rated Sun, Sea and Sand an 8.5, which if you all remember that means I haven't settled on a final rating and will either rate it an 8 or 9 after a few more plays.  It's now a 9.

Played once as a 2-player game and looked pretty good. Have to get it to the table once more.

Maaany years later... played it again with 3 and it's still a fine game with enough depth to keep it interesting.  Looks like there are only a few strategies available, but all in all a fun game with a nice refreshing theme and some nice ideas.

Nothing groundbreaking, but a very solid light weight game.

The box is not very inspiring and the multi-part board is rather fiddly, but once you get beyond these issues you find a fun and engaging game. Sun, Sea and Sand is one of the most thematic mid-weight board games I have ever played: fat meeples who head for the bar, active meeples who prefer sea-sports, backpackers who check in at the poorest resort or sleep on the beach...and all this with a sea-shell starting-player marker! The game mechanics are not entirely original but work well - a restricted number of actions per turn and lack of money keep players on their toes. The option to secure advance bookings from tourists is a particularly nice touch.

Congratulations to van Moorsel.  This is an excellent example of the punch a mid weight Euro can deliver in 45 minutes when theme and mechanism really hang together nicely.

Sun, Sea, and Sand is a short worker placement game which, due to its innovative time mechanic that seems to come straight out of the real-time strategy mold, is more heavily focused on strategy and forward planning than on opportunism.

I would have liked to see a little more mechanically to distinguish the different colors of attraction - as it is they are distinguished thematically but basically all perform the same functions with the exception of one of the red restaurants.

We're a bit concerned about replayability though one play is too few to come to a conclusion on that front.

Once players get past the unpolished exterior, Sun, Sea & Sand provides a quick uncomplicated worker placement fix. Inspirations by Hotel Samoa are visible which is not surprising when you know that Hotel Samoa's online predecessor is hosted on Cwali's website. But Cwali went the extra mile to expand the hosting mechanism into a more strategic game. It's fine for occasional play although I doubt that there's much variety in the long term and not much hidden depth.

A decent worker placement game with a nice little twist of different actions taking different amounts of time, thus tying up the workers for a while. Except for the scoring the theme also makes a lot of sense, which always helps. Plays really quickly.

Though it seems like there's just a little bit too much chrome for what really wants to be a lighter game (e.g. the backpacker).

Hmm...I'm not sure I understand why everyone is talking about the theme.  The game still feels pretty mechanical, and while the artwork is attractive, I sure don't feel like I'm running a resort while playing the game.  I like the time element, which is really the heart of the game, since the buildings are so important.  But I'm not sure how much staying power the game has, since there's not too much variability aside from the order of ships.  The backpacker also just seems kind of random.

Theme and the looks definitely didn't draw me in, though the wooden components are nicely done. The extra problematic with the theme is why do the island people only start building their tourist resorts as tourists start pouring to the island. Mechanically a nice combination of time and money management and worker placement. There are some minor things that possibly could have used some streamlining, but altogether a pleasant offering.

It works but it's a bit uninteresting. Also a strange hybrid: it should be played for fun and fast and then it would be the most enjoyable. But at the same it needs lots of calculation, combination and estimation which can be AP-inducing. So you either keep thinking a lot for winning and then the game gets way too long, or play it fast but then you won't win...

LIKE:

* Unique worker placement mechanic in that some actions you choose will prevent your worker from being used for 1-3 rounds as it is busy building part of your resort, recruiting tourists, and the like.
* Instructions are clear and concise and the game plays quickly while maintaining tension in your action choices.
* The backpacker is a neat little mechanic that potentially adds a random tourist to your resort.
* You get the joy of building your own resort and seeing tourists stay and make you money.
* Money can be tight as you develop your economic engine.
* Appears to scale well from 3-5 players.

DISLIKES:

* None as of right now.

Szállodaigazgatót alakítanak a játékosok, akiknek a célja értelemszerűen az, hogy minél több vendég szálljon meg a szállodájukban, és minél tovább maradjanak. Ez a téma számomra egyáltalán nem vonzó, de illik a játék mechanizmusaihoz, erősíti azokat, egyáltalán nem erőltetett.

A játékelemek számomra nem túl szépek és nem is kellően praktikusak: az épületek árának növekedésekor túl közel vannak a szomszédos épületlapkák, és nagyon vigyázni kell, nehogy beleakadjanak az éppen csúsztatottak, és azokat is elmozdítsuk. Az érkező hajók kivevése és csúsztatgatása kicsit macerás. A bungalók felvevése az asztalról sem elég egyszerű, én legalábbis nehezen tudtam felemelni a lapkákat. A minőség amúgy teljesen rendben van.

A szerencse szerepe nulla, ez nagy előny. Nem kell sokat várni a többiekre, hamar sor kerül az emberre, gyorsan folyik a játék. Ez is előny, az viszont már nem, hogy mintha túl hamar véget érne a játék. Pár (nyolc) kör és vége is. Ugyanakkor, bár gyorsan zajlik a játék, mégis nagyon sokat is lehet gondolkozni egy-egy lépésen. Ez ellentmondásnak tűnik, nem is tudom hirtelen feloldani. A játék tényleg nagyon komplex, nagyon sokat lehet gondolkozni a legjobb lépésen. Nem csak hogy az adott helyzetből miképp lehet a legtöbbet kihozni, hanem több környit előre is lehet gondolkozni.

A játékosok egymásra közvetlenül nem hatnak, kommunikációt nem igényel a játék, de közvetve kifejezetten erős az interakció: egymás elől elfoglalni a turistákat és az épületeket, illetve a kör végén megmaradó pénzeket is belekalkulálva úgy intézni, hogy lehetőleg hozzánk essen be az extra turista.

Drága látványosságokat kell szerezni, de figyelni kell azok elhelyezésére is. Figyelni, hogy mely turistákat hívjam magamhoz, és hogy legyen nekik elég szállás. Végső soron a cél a legtöbb győzelmi pont megszerzése. Győzelmi pont a minél vonzóbb látványosságokból (épületekből) jön elsősorban, másodsorban pedig az utolsó kör végén éppen nálunk megszálló vendégek számából, és az épületek egymáshoz való elhelyezkedéséből (a lyukak is pontot érnek). Komplex ez a játék, és ez a nagy előnye. Komplex, fogyasztható, könnyen tanulható (egy játék után minden szabály és mechanizmus világos, már lehet a stratégiára, azaz a játék élvezetére koncentrálni), jó minőségű játékelemekkel, kritikusan rossz tulajdonsága biztosan nincs. A játékidő rövidsége ugyanis helyzettől függően előnynek is tekinthető.
A gyengéi szerintem:
1. A játékelemek kezdeti felállítása viszonylag időigényes (2-3 perc).
2. Az épületlapkák csúsztatáskor könnyen összeakadnak.
3. A pénzszámlálón több játékos jelzője is lehet ugyanazon a mezőn egymásra rakva, és így közülük kissé macerás a sajátot kivenni. 

Jó játék, semmiképp nem érzem jogosnak az 1139. helyezést a listán - előbbre sorolnám, a top 200-ba mindenképp.

Update: A második játék után nagyjából egyetértek a fent leírtakkal. Annyi, hogy most nem éreztem macerásnak a kis bungalók felvételét, de az épületlapkák csúsztatgatását továbbra is. A játékot eredményesen játszani ösztönösen nem biztos hogy lehet, viszont ha valaki szeret sokat számolgatni a lépései előtt, itt van rá lehetősége (bár sok számolgatás nélkül is lehet vele kellemeset játszani).

I rarely rate good games since we're not supposed to give an 8, 9, nor 10 unless we "will never turn down a game"?  Who on earth can say that about any one game? (And it is logically impossible to say it about 2 games.) But for now, this is close to true for me about Sun Sea & Sand (after 2 games of it today at BGG.con 2010) And, in a 1-10 system without any description of what the numbers mean, I'd rank it a 9.  So hooray, for once I can rank a game without a moral dilemma about whether to follow the (illogical) BGG definitions of what each number means.

Update: after 1.5 years and many plays (and teaching lots of people), my rating holds up.  Still my favorite game.  Also unusual in that it plays well with as few as 2 players.  Beautifully designed to vary it in appropriate ways for different numbers of players.

I have rarely played 2 games in a row for the last 10 years, this is one of those. As for a light-medium complexity game, the rules of this game could be explained in 5 minutes and each game would last less than an hour. The theme is the strongest part here: every single mechanism in the game does not feel like arbitary. Could be easily be enjoyed by families or hardcore gamers as starter/ finisher. Strongly recommended!
Edited on 3/10/2015: Still a 9 after almost 5 years. much enjoyed by all players.

Played 10-15 times. This game has grown on me. Rate it an 8 after 11 plays. Works really well as a 2-pl with the 10-yo. Interestingly, some seasoned gamers I played with had trouble learning this. If you know the game it plays really quick. Probably best with 2 or 4 since there are eight rounds and start marker moves each turn.

Wife likes this game, and she appears to be a natural at it.  All my brain cycles contemplating backpackers, spaces, income, and attractions are all for naught when Lee's intuition gets the win.  She says she doesn't consider my needs when making her moves, only hers.  The only thing that is random in the game is the list of customers for the 8 turns/weeks.  A tight economy/worker placement game in less than an hour makes this a game that we're sure to come back to.  Only time will tell if it has the longevity to keep us both interested.

Prototype played. This is Corné's new game that I like the best. It is an interesting game of worker placement and economy. Build hotel rooms, build attractions and attract tourists. The more attractions you have, the longer they stay. And there is a backpacker moving around each round. Make sure you get him to stay with you, it is a free extra visitor.

Enjoyable drafting / optimization game with a fun and fitting theme of tourists at a beach resort.  Tourists are drafted in lots and then will fill buildings which you buy and place onto your resort.  Depending on your buildings and the color of the tourists they will stay longer at your resorts (which you want in order to earn extra money).  Familiar mechanics but put together in a fresh new package.  Cwali always seems to have a unique twist in each of his games along with a solid theme.

Some interesting mechanisms here. I really like the way time is handled, resulting in a conveyor belt of workers loaded at different points from receipt. The decisions feel juicy but I'm not sure how much they matter--in both games I played all but one player was within 1 point of each other.

The perfect game for the dead of winter or height of summer here in Midwest where there are few nice lakes or beaches. Feel like I'm at a nice resort on the beach. Always brings a smile to my face, even when I lose. Nice 2 player game, though bit more fun with 4-5.

Enjoyable worker-placement game with a cute theme and perfect information. Doesn't feel like there is deep strategic variation to be explored, as most games will play out in a similar fashion... but accomplishes what it tries to do very well and has enough tactical diversity to bring you back for multiple games.

We've played this game quite a few times now and have enjoyed every session. The rating is starting to fluctuate though; I'm not sure how often we'll want to come back to the game.

A decent enough game that would be greatly improved with quality components. Fun. Like the time-usage mechanism a lot. Though, not the first game I would reach for; though, if it made use of heavy duty cardstock (a la Colosseum) I would be tempted to want to play it more.

Gioco sul turismo con una buona programmazione che però non mi ha convinto. Materiali e grafica non troppo accattivanti il gioco si lascia giocare e ha un'ambientazione simpatica ma non risulta particolarmente profondo ma soprattutto un po' ripetitivo. Dello stesso spessore e ambientazione mi ricorda per diversi versi Hotel Samoa. Nel gioco bisogna attrarre i turisti con il proprio villaggio e cercare di non farli andare via offrendo attrazioni valide. Il turista errante che non prenota è tremendamente casuale. Sufficiente ma nulla di più.

There is something a little dissonant about Sun, Sea and Sand: the theme is about developing a holiday resort, so you expect a game that is at least a little lighthearted and relaxed. But what you get is a game that features perfect information, very tight resource management and economics. I will concede that in reality, managing a holiday destination is a tough business, but the theme still sits uncomfortably. And no one in the hotel business has perfect information.

There are 8 rounds:
Each round a new ship arrives, and players will generally want to collect some new guests. All eight ships are visible to players from the start of the game: their order, and the selection of tourists they bring are the only variables in the game.
But first, there must be rooms available for them - rooms can be built instantly, but the worker then takes two weeks to recover (?! This works as a resource management rule, but is weird thematically).
Finally, you want to dedicate still more workers to the construction of attractions; these encourage visitors to stay longer, and are worth lots of points at the end. Just like accommodation buildings, the attractions appear immediately but the worker who builds them is exhausted for several weeks.
This repeats each round. Players manage their money (income for visitors, less various costs for buildings) and their workforce. Be careful not to build too much or you go broke, or all your workers will take a sickie for a fortnight.
Sun, Sea and Sand almost works really well, but felt rather contrived. We played with 5, and I think it needs that many players to ensure some chaos between turns. With 2 or 3 I think it would turn into a grinding game of calculation and paralysed analysis. But others differ; my partner is talking about getting a copy. So my impression may change with more play.

[i]A note for colourblind players: there are no great difficulties with S,S&S, but one set of player markers is grey and another is pale pink. These appeared to me to be perfectly identical. There are only 6 of each, and substituting either set solves the problem.[/i]

Another winner! I really love Cwali games. The mechanics of the game are so fresh and new and totally unique from any other game experience. This is what makes Cwali games so good and this is also a description of Sun, Sea and Sand. 

I love the theme, it's simple to play. The game board is cleverly put together and the components are fun to play with. I love the backpackers and the traveling around the game area. I love the tourists and how you try to get them to come stay at your resort and try to keep them there with attractions. I love the little welcome signs that pull in the backpackers. So much fun.

Nice little gateway game with quite some options. The timing aspect of your workers is nice. The heavier duty you give them or the further away you assign them out to get tourists, the longer they stay away from your family resource pool. Components are crap though (too thin cardboard; all separate elements)

"Low-randomness game that is pretty thematic, yet fairly gamey at the same time. Like Logistico, it has some counter-intuitive strategies, and is more of a brain-burner than it might first appear. I like that the interaction is mostly limited to racing to grab limited resources. "

What I like:
- Fun theme, carried through with the different meeple shapes
- Meaty but pretty quick (4p learning game took 70 minutes)
- Clever mechanism where actions take "time"

What I don't like:
- The backpacker rules are stupid. Pointless. Random. Unhelpful. 
- Generally I prefer randomness throughout a game, not just in setup
- The rulebook is not terrible, but  has a couple rough areas

Incredible fun, thematic game.

The depth is there and it features lots of good mechanics that simply gel very well together.

The board is very colourful. This is a mid-weight game and looks harder to master than it looks, so it's not your typical light weight family game, although the theme makes it even more enjoyable.

How this game is not even in top 500 is beyond me... This game is a true gem and real masterpiece.

This is a great worker placement game that really has a strategic and tactical side to the game.  If one loses sight of either then a loss could result.  I like the aspect of building a functionally resort while trying to manage tourist and future booked tourists. If one doesn't prepare properly then there will not be enough income to expand you resort.   I love the twist of the backpacker because you are always weighing into your decisions if you can get them in your door and have space for them.  This is truly a great game that is easy to learn but have a good amount of depth and my wife will actually play it which is a plus.

Probably a high 6. Players each control a resort which they must develop with money they gain by attracting tourists (meeples in 4 different colours). Each player has five workers and the game requires both management of these and money.
It is quite diverting and the theme is rather fun. There does seem to be quite an advantage for first turn.

Juggling many things at once - specifically available actions (as spending on some actions locks up an available action for up to 3 turns) and money (necessary to get upgrades, but worthless at game's end).  Add into that the random backpack, and most decisions are fairly straight forward.  Some adjustment of tempos as purchasing an item too late might increase its cost beyond your money but need to balance that with the arriving (available) tourists.

Egy olyan játék, amely gyakorlatilag semmi újat nem mutat a mechanizmusok terén. Mégis valahogy a témát jól visszaadja. Egészen remek szórakozás.
Corné van Moorsel témaválasztásai mindig valami számomra érdekes dolgot érintenek, ez is ilyen.

Pro:
- a téma
- a hátizsákos turista (és annak "működése")
- a time track
- a kezdőjátékos jelző kagyló (bírom az ilyen kreatívkodást)

Kontra:
- a megvalósítás (minőségibb is lehetne az anyaghasználat, kicsit vékonyabbak a kartonok a megszokottnál)
- a grafika (igaz, egyediek a faházak rajzai, meg hangulatos az egész, de ennél is többet ki lehetett volna hozni belőle szerintem)
- AP veszély (túlgondolkozni azonban nem szabad/nem érdemes)

Aki szereti a témát (a tengert) és nem idegenkedik a worker placementtől az nem fog csalódni. Összességében kellemes játék, amely szerintem kissé alulértékelt (ez lehet annak köszönhető, hogy a Cwali nem egy kiadógigász).
---
Sajnos a szabályok hagynak nyitott kérdéseket, amelyeket azonban egy kis rugalmassággal könnyen lehet kezelni.
Ilyenek: mi van akkor, ha az előfoglalásból érkezőknek nem jut faház (a.) szállásoljunk el annyit, amennyit tudunk, a többiek -$1-ral csökkentik a pénzt, b.) csak annyi turista kerülhet a hotelvezető táblára (mindenkit beleértve!), ahány hely van a faházakba).

I love Corne Van Morsel and his quirky games. I also own this year's Habitas. I find his games to be very relaxing. Even thought this one is quite light, it can be quite strategic since it's perfect info and there's basically no luck. It also works great as a gateway game sinced the theme is quite appealing to a lot of people. I like how the ship tiles are double sided so that adds a little bit of replay value. The artwork is charming and the different shaped meeples are fantastic. Particularly the red fat one, hilarious!

Players build their own a beach resort properties, attracting tourists and making buck. The more attractions you have, the longer certain kinds of tourists will remain at your resort. There's some competition for resources, such as attractions, tourists and signs. There's an interesting time-keeping mechanism here. I like it but I imagine I'll get bored of it after a couple more plays.

The main complaint I would lay against this is that it feels "too" balanced.  In retrospect, it seems as though everyone has done pretty much the same sort of things (especially given the upfront information), just not in the same order so it only looks as though you are following different routes to victory.

Szerencsefaktor mentes munkáslerakós játék, aminek a témája a vendéglátás. Turistákat csalogatunk egy szigeten a magunk területére, hogy nálunk töltsék el a nyaralásukat. Különböző látnivalókat építünk, hogy minél tovább maradjanak. A fix nyolckörös játékban hajók hozzák különböző csoportokban a turistákat, akiket családtagjaink csábíthatnak hozzánk. Lehet őket előjegyezni is és addig maradnak nálunk, amíg érdeklődési körüknek megfelelő látnivalót találnak. Kicsit talán egyértelmű, hogyan kell játszani, nagyon sok út nincs a játékban, de az idővel egyre másabb területek lesznek fontosak. Az újrajátszhatósági faktorban és az újdonság hiányában vérzik el a játék véleményem szerint, de hiba nem igazán van benne, ezért egy közepes osztályzatot kap tőlem.

Initial impression based on one 2p game is extremely favourable. Worker placement game with light mechanics, strong theme and lots to get your teeth into. Nice production (the meeples are superb -especially the fat red beer drinking ones) Plus for a short and easy to learn game there is a lot to think about, with locking up workers for long periods of time v quick payoffs.

Corne's best for years and one that I think I will play a lot of times. Possibly the best mid weight Euro of 2010 - definitely more interesting than Fresco which is about the same complexity

I was also very surprised (fall of chair standard surprised) to find my name and address on the back of the box as part of the design.

Another hit from Corné. Really has a strong thematic feeling of building your resort with the tourists coming through. Nice blend of elements to juggle. Usually I find perfect-information games without randomness very dry, but this has a light, "fun" feel to it that completely gets me past that.
The backpacker and signs elements feels strange though - more like a bonus to the player on the left of the player with the least money than anything else.

Played twice with three players.

Interesting worker placement game where each turn players could easily have a different number of workers to work with as some tasks take multiple weeks to accomplish. The backpacker introduces a nice dynamic as a player may be able to manipulate things just right to get some tourists without having to spend an action on it. Components are very nice with functional artwork. I wish it was a little easier removing the boat from the previous week, but it works out decently.

Theme matches pretty nicely to the mechanics really well although it doesn't make sense that the cabanas and attractions take 2-3 weeks to build, but are available immediately; if they wouldn't be available until completion, the game wouldn't work, so I am ok with it.

This should scale nicely from 2 to 5 players, but probably best with 3-4 as 5 players might have too much down time and 2 players might not have enough competition.

Unsure about replayability at this point as the only variable is the number of tourists available each week and what your opponents do. Each game we played, definitely played out differently. So far, so good.

Excellent for 3 or 4. 5 is tight, but good, too. Two-player sucks: after 2 or 3 games it just becomes too predictable. Whichever attraction you don't get, your opponent will. No real choices left when just 2 play. Maybe it would be better if you used 2 of each of the attractions. Plan to try that next.

Sun, Sea & Sand is a generious buffet of Euro game mechanisms, spiced up with a sprinking of chaos.  The visual presentation is sprawling and a couple of representations, such as guests leaving their rooms to stay on an amenity tile, don't really work.  Did more than one production team develop this?  Nevertheless, Sun, Sea & Sand is a modern family game, but it's best for a family of gamers.

A fairly nondescript worker placement game.  The theme is adequately implemented and the player has some decisions to make, but there's nothing about it that would make me come back.

Love the theme and the look of the game.
It's a bit heavier than it seems though, don't expect a light family game, medium at least. The rules are easy enough (very well and clearly written) for a family game or for non-gamers, but there are some tough choices to be made.
Scores are a bit too close to my liking, which makes me think your actions don't always matter that much. There seems to be no really bad move. But a fun game none the less.

Really enjoyed my first two plays.  The programming of looking ahead for what tourists will be coming in future weeks is a little taxing at first, but is a lot of fun.  With everyone else competing for the same customers and amenities, and with prices fluctuating based on how many of each item are left, there's a lot of tension about what actions to take and in what order.  Looking forward to more plays!

Update: 15 plays in and I'm still loving Sun, Sea & Sand.  The boat setup and player choices seem to really make each game different.  It feels like there are a lot of possible paths given the game constraints.  It's hard to understand why this game didn't make more of a splash.

Very nifty little engine build game. It frustrates and keeps you on your toes constantly. I love the start player marker too.

Colorful presentation of euro style worker placement as players compete with limited resources to create the most attractive resorts. Some medium range planning is required along with the tactical choices.

Its all about attracting vacationers to your family's resort hotel on the coast of an island shared by the other player's resort hotels. Cool meeples! After several plays am finding this nice quick/short deep game is close and tight, and enjoyed by most players. Hard to remember you must have a room for all guests whether in their room or at one of your resort's attractions. Also, you have to pay $1 for each prebooked guest for whom you don't have enough room (taxi fare?)

The game works fine, but it doesn't seem like one game will feel much different from the next. Given the number of things you have to do, the game seems to be all about tiny efficiencies - getting a dollar more here or there. I generally find that dull after a play or two.

There are some nice ideas here (like the delay getting back your workers), but overall at least the first game left a bit of an underdeveloped feeling. For such a simple game, I think there are too many small details to remember/understand (especially how the backpackers work). Also, the economics of the game seemed to be quite strange (in our game at least). First, money was really tight, but after a while, there was nothing to really spend it all. Maybe we played it using a "wrong strategy", but I think it is important that game is not too fragile for this kind of "dumb play".

Some good stuff going on here.  There is a lot of planning in making sure you have huts for your tourists and getting attractions to keep them at your resort.  Money is fairly tight, and purchasing attractions raises the price for everyone else, so the best laid plans can easily be ruined.  Pretty easy to learn, plays quick, and it's fun to build up your resort.

Keeping the play area organized was a little challenging - especially the ships arriving each week and the guests on them.

Tourists passing through your resort pay money, which you can then use to upgrade the features of the resort.  The features are worth points, which is how the game is actually scored (not money). 

So on one hand the Tourists are just an indirect means to obtain points, but on the other hand Tourists present at the moment the game ends are themselves counted as points.  Make your Hotel full at the peak moment.

All tourists are created equal but you may target a partuclar type by building enhancements that they favor, thereby  allowing you to  collect incremental income when they visit.

Interesting time measurement for performing certain actions. It translates to a changing number of actions that can be performed in each round - somthing more to manage.

Use your workers to build chalets for guests, resort pieces to entertain them, and pick up tourists off the boats. Tourists come in 4 different colours, and only stay if you've built entertainment in their colour, so matching everything up is really important. No hidden information, it's purely up to your planning to best pull this off. If you need, you can reserve guests in the future, but that means you'll have less workers and actions available next round.

Besides being fun to play, the game has some excellent physical design in it, you use parts of the board to cover up tourists to scale the game down for 3 or 2 player games. Really well done.

Worker placement in a beach resort.  The theme is fun and the worker interaction seemed to make sense to me.  It was a pretty fun game.

What a wonderfully unique take on worker placement! In this resort and guest managing game, your workers will be occupied for a certain amount of time depending on what you get them to do. Players need to cater to four different kinds of guests, who desire sea, beach, sports and comfort/social activities and entertainments. Develop your resort to both accommodate guests and keep them entertained so they stay longer. Can't wait to run it!

Building resorts and attracting tourists. This is a worker placement game where some jobs (building a chalet, reserving tourists) take longer than one turn to return. Great theme and plays in about an hour. Rating could move up with more plays.

After 1 Play: There just wasn't any room to make interesting decisions.  Everyone builds slightly different buildings, but they function nearly the same.  They are all equally useful and the money to point ratio is about the same.  We all ended with remarkably similar boards and the spread from first to last was 2 points.

The variable time delay in getting workers back based on the actions chosen is the only interesting part of the game, and I'd like to see it used elsewhere.

Relatively short and easy to learn game, basically worker placement, but some get tied up for longer than others depending on the actions you chose. And money is tight early on. Theme and mechanics work, although I'm not sure about the backpacker. Solid game.

This rating is for the whole Thunderstone Advance family, not just the starter set. I didn't know what other generic title to file my rating under.

I enjoy the core deck building mechanic and think that its application towards a fantasy theme works surprisingly well (especially its implementation of a 'dungeon' with levels of 'darkness' to delve into). 

I rate it 'very good' because while I really like playing a good game of Thunderstone, you have to be quite careful in setting up the game in order for it to be a reasonably balanced, fun experience. The interactions of the cards don't seem to gel together quite as easily as, say, Dominion--and this is certainly due to Thunderstone having an added layer of complexity in assembling a proper adventuring party that can defeat the monsters in the darkness. 

Both the selection of enemy groups to fight and things to buy in the town need some thought beyond pure randomization, which does hold up the setup process a bit.  You can potentially use a randomizer app. Using the Thunderstone Advance board helps a bit too. When you get things right, I think it's a very fun game.

I may have ruined Thunderstone by getting the starter instead of going straight to Towers of Ruin. Have only played twice so far, so may need to update down the track. 

The problem I have is the fact that I was totally hosed by the card draw, so I could never fight anything, while my opponent just kept advancing and levelling up his people. By the time I got some decent draws, the game was basically a foregone conclusion.

RATING: 6
Good for learning Thunderstone, but other then that, I would not keep playing this set alone. There is not enough variety in it to let the randomness of the game come out. I added this into my other sets.

RATING: 7
Thunderstone is a deckbuilding game that plays very similar to Dominion, with a few more layers of complexity.  

Players can choose to buy cards by going to the village, or go to the dungeon and use card from their hand to defeat monster and get xp.  You then use this xp to "level up" you hero cards to more powerful versions.

The games can run a little long IMO (over an hour), and I'm not a huge fan of the deckbuilding mechanic, but I would take this over Dominion any day.  The theme is really nice, while Dominion is pretty stale.

This starter pack doesn't come with much variety - you will need to pick up another set/expansion if you want to give it a little more legs.  I've played with this and Caverns of Bane.

Deckbuilder that I just did not enjoy. IIRC, you are trying to defeat monsters and also recruiting new people and purchasing items for your deck to improve your combat against the monsters. There aren't limits on how many cards you can recruit or buy. Generally I just found the game lacking. Maybe because I didn't really get anywhere with my deck, so nothing really comboed very well. There are a number of other deckbuilders that I find more enjoyable so I can't imagine playing this one again.

Compare to Dominion: harder to learn, more theme, less popular, more ways to play (solo, co-operative, etc), less strategy (?), the ability to level up.

Problems: 1.a little mathy calculating weights, 2.items cards are not very useful, 3.too much luck (?). This starter set doesn't have any variability.

For dungeon crawl, go with Descent or Pathfinder. For deck builders, go for Dominion.

I actually prefer Dominion over this and this game almost turned me off to the deckbuilding mechanism. The theme and art is there but the gameplay is not at least with the starting setup.

Great deck building game but I wish it would take less time - slow to start up, especially if there are only strong enemies.
Less cards than in e.g. Numenera but most are actually bought and used.
Good two player game but your deck will contain a lot of (more or less useless) trophies compared to a four player game.
Card stock (German first edition) could be thicker/higher quality.

This is totally a Tabletop Simulator purchase... After a few plays it felt like something I had to own.  Starting with the Starter set, but I expect more will be getting added.

This set leaves a little something to be desired.  It's very much a taste.  I've played the game a few times now and we keep running into the same issue where the levels get clogged early by huge monsters.  Eventually someone just bites the bullet and fails a combat to keep things moving.

This is Thunderstone Advance, dispite not saying it on the box :(.  Way, way, WAY better then basic Thunderstone.  It kept all the advantages and the great look, while geting rid of most of the hangups in gameplay.

1 play only, dominion like but not dominion. Like the theme, and the slowly pace than i expected from the game.  The prepare mechanism is a nice touch.  I like the starter kit being minimalist, so i am not thrown by all the options.  I think i could play this a few more times and then go to an expansion. Enjoyable fun that i would like to play again soon (Oct 2013). UPDATE: I seem to need this as I never get around to the full Thunderstone, so it ends up being back to "third base" (Rating 7.185 Jan 17)

Very basic entry version of Thunderstone Advance. Since only basic rules are included, using expansions with it means you need to download the full rules and keep them at hand for everything that is not explained in the starter rules. Unless you have never played a deckbuilding game or really want to have Thunderstone and cannot find Towers of Ruin or Worlds Collide, then there is not much of a reason to get this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good deckbuilder but after all is said and done... just yet another deckbuilder.

Setup a pool of cards (the village) and a dungeon, then start the carnage. Build the best deck you can!

Probably the best thing about this game is how the cards really allow you to go for a very specific deck archetype. I love sleek, efficient decks. This game lets me build them. While the layout really looks similar to Dominion, there is just so much more here. The theme is obviously present and Dominion doesn't allow you to build archetypes like I mentioned before.

It's a good game. But these days... that just doesn't cut it anymore :/
Though I don't think anyone would dislike having this game in their collection :p

Just too many problems with this game.  You have ZERO interaction with anyone else.  You spend way too many turns just tossing bad hands or looking at a bunch of high HP creatures in the dungeon that no one can kill.  The game relies a lot on randomness of who draws the killing hand or what comes up next to block or help the next person.  Enough better deck builders exist that this just isn't worth playing.

Love the deck-building, and the theme of braving dungeons with ever more powerful heroes works (though I guess the town part doesn't make a lot of sense - my torch is worth 2 gold? Am I renting it out?). The setup and teardown takes a while, but the game is worth the effort.

We dusted this off.  I'd played it solo, but we'd never played it as a group before.  We ended up looking for an hour-long game and decided we'd give it a shot.  90 minutes later we'd finished the game, albeit with a few tweaks along the way to keep it simple as we were starting.

Deck-building mechanic is pretty sound, and the "village" (heroes, items, spells) give you quite a bit of flexibility, although really the only path is killing monsters (vs. other possible victory conditions).  But considering that's what my entire group is a fan of it fit very well.

a nice set of additional cards.  Several of them are quite interesting, but several are so bad that I don't see them ever being bought (and thus just being dead cards on the board, or traps for new players).

RATING: 7
I have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It is a fantastic concept for a deckbuilding game with a lot of depth and progression.  This is definitely a more complex deckbuilder than what else is out there, but MAN it is clunky.  Every time I have played this game I can't help but think it would benefit from a 3rd edition rules revision and some cleanup on card interactions.  

That being said, the main draw behind this game is the dual purpose to each card.  You either go to the dungeon and fight monsters, or you go into town to recruit heroes and buy weapons for fighting in the dungeon.  Heroes in your deck level up as you gain experience in the dungeon.  There is always a race between players on who can level up their heroes fastest, since the highest level heroes are in limited supply.  Deciding whether to shop or to fight is always fun.  Turns can get deliciously complex, which again would feel better if it felt we didn't have to consult the manual or the internet so much.  Rewriting some of the cards would clean up most of these issues with regular may/must can/can't always/never terminology we see in other games.  

As a result, I have to give this a 7.  I love playing this game, but the needless clunkiness leaves another edition to be desired, and those without the patience to work through those ambiguities should probably not play this game.

It is a bit thin compared to other sets, it really only gives a taste of Thunderstone Advance but not the full experience and games are far less varied due to the much smaller card pool.

It is now mixed into the big box, so plays are recorded there.

A great fantasy deckbuilder.  Solo play is touch, but playing with friends has a lot of tactical play...hard to know just who is winning sometimes.

Made better with Epic Thunderstone variant though - truly like embarking on a fantasy adventure, as you use all the cards, not just a subset.  Since you do get lots, this does make sense for that reason too.

i love deckbuilders and dnd, so was predisposed to love this.  and didn't.  not sure why but i would like to play again.  i like the prepare/mulligan rule, missed the trashing rule, and generally thought it took far too long to get the engine going.  too many trips to the town to buy/level up.  dunno really why this bothers me in Thunderstone and NOT in Dominion (where it is literally the entire game; there's no fighting in it), but it did.  i wanted to go FIGHTING NOW.

Very "lite" version of Thunderstone Advance. No hard decisions to be made, almost every play style is viable, monsters are relatively easy to kill. There are no treasures or complex abilities. It has limited replay value, but the cards blend quite well into the other expansions when playing Randomizers. Overall, it serves its function as a Starter Set very well, although I deem it unnecessary for veteran deck builders.

Az egyik legnepszerubb pakliepitos jatek, fantasy kontosben. A hosok szintlepese es a dungeon kezelese is nagyon eltalalt mechanizmus. Interakcio inkabb a jatekelemek manipulalasa altal van, de direkt konfliktus nelkul is izgalmas a jatek. A kartyak minosege megkivanhatja a tokot, illetve ebben az arban benne lehetne par XP token is. 
Ez a doboz amolyan ismerkedésnek jó a rendszerrel - nincs sok választási lehetőség a paklikban, viszont nem is duplikált egyik sem, így bármely kiegészítővel, vagy az alapdobozzal is turbózhatjuk a készletünket.

Very Good condition. Small dent damage to bottom box. Components are undamaged. Opened, played three times. All cards are sorted, and are in Like New condition.

Thunderstorm is a competitive deck builder with a limited number of cards to use for upgrades that are hotly contested. I don't love the competition for cards but the game play is fun enough to be worth it. I imagine that epic Thunderstorm with a few expansions would make this a 9+ for me.

Some additional basic cards to my Epic-Light variant of the game. It's nice, although not a stellar addition to the game.

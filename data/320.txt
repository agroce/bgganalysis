This is another one of my staple games when I was growing up, and I've probably played it over a hundred times. My wife and I played this all the time in our first few years of marriage, and have not really touched it since we were introduced to a few gateway games by our friends (and the rest is history). I used to play Words With Friends on my phone until finally I just got sick of it and deleted the app. I've never gone back and the overplay has killed any desire to play Scrabble, though if my family back home wanted to play it I would be game, I suppose.

RATING: 7
Used to play this a lot as a child, I still find it sufficiently fun and challenging that I'll readily give it a play (unless I'm tired and don't have the patience for picking up terrible letters). Perhaps the biggest frustration is playing against people who use each turn for maximum (immediate) gain and subsequently render large portions of the board inaccessible. And, depending on how serious everyone is, it's probably worth having a good (i.e., large) dictionary on hand!

RATING: 7
The key things about scrabble are that it is really only a two player game and it must be played with a timer (preferably a chess clock) and with a proper Official Scrabble Words on hand - squabbling over whether Qi really is a word gets dull after a while. Then all you need is the random tile draw to be not to biased and it can be good fun.

Scrabble is inherently broken in that it relies on a particular wordlist which isn't included in the game, and doesn't include words which are used by many people on an everyday basis. It's basically a torture test to see who can memorize the most words (and not even their definitions, just the spelling). Very little strategy. Avoid.

Would be rated higher, except: How good you are at this game seems to mostly be determined by how many 2 letter words & weird short words with X's and Q's you know.

I prefer Boggle.

It's definately one of the better "classic mainstream games," and there's obviously a lot of skill and knowledge in it.  To avoid disagreements, it's also worth picking up one of the Official Scrabble wordbooks, especially if you can find one going cheap - I got one for £1 in a book-sale type shop.

I love word games - mainly because I love using words, and this game is all about that. I own a Scrabble dictionary and the words in it are amazing. Truly, some words should never go out of style. Of course, when I play against my husband he insists on using the OED, which is fine by me.  We have very close games, as he is as good with words as I am. I still remember the time I scored 86 points with a word, giving a scant 9 point lead over him! It was glorious.

When my sister and I were growing up, we would often play Scrabble, but it was always either a cooperative game or a themed game. Themed is easy to explain - all the words had to be flowers, or parts of the body, something silly like that. It made it much harder. 

How did we make Scrabble co-op? Well, the win condition was that both players had to use all their tiles at the end of the game, or neither player won. And we allowed trades - sort of like adding "Go Fish" to Scrabble - "can I have a C?" If yes, then one player would trade for the C with another letter they didn't need. Otherwise they would discard the C and take a new tile. My sister and I tended to create our own rules for games...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Well it's obviously a classic, but I feel that with the addition of newer words (such as qi) into the dictionaries (since 1948), it fundamentally screws up the game a bit. If you use a 1948 dictionary then it's probably perfect.

A staple. Everyone knows how to play, and most are even willing to every once in a while. I like it enough that I enjoy it occasionally. Any game is better than no game!

I wouldn't want to play a "pro", those who seem to practically break the game by turning it into a contest of "how many 2 letter words do you know" or "how well have you memorized the Scrabble dictionary".

You know this trick when you say a word many times and after a while it starts sounding weird? Try it. Scrabble. Scrrrrabble. Scrabbbbble. Scrabblllllle. Scrabble!

Scrabble is a classic. And, like many classic board games, it's a bit unfair. It's only really fun to play when you're good with words. And when everybody else at the table is good with words, too. Otherwise, you just end up in an untidy knot. of. very. short. words. Which. is. so. lame. Like. yes. really. lame.

And whoever takes one for the team and places a hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian word (yeah, look that up on wikipedia!) loses in the end, because he allows everybody to just place even more tiny words. Which is very weird and annoying.

Then again it really is a family game, so probably I just shouldn't take it too seriously. Like so many other little things that happen during the Christmas holidays, a game is of Scrabble is something that is kind of nice, but also something you better get over with quickly.

Nevertheless, the name is great. Scrabble! Scrrrabble. Scrabble!

This game is as fun as a root canal.  A game?  No.  It's just an exercise to see who memorized the most small "q" and "x" words from the dictionary.  

"Hey, I memorized a bunch of Q words that don't start with "Qu", like "Qat."
Do you even know what that word means?  
No, I just memorized it from the Scrabble dictionary.

I have always believed that a dinosaur can help make any game (except [thing=483][/thing]), tolerable, but I'm not sure: I think the only way a dinosaur could help this was if you had a REAL dinosaur and he ate the game...and the person who recommended that you play it.

This might be a little low simply because I don't enjoy word games.  If you love using tiles to create words, well then this is the classic.

The classic anagram game can be great fun with similarly skilled like minded people when it doesn't drag on for far too long and is not decided by simple good luck. Unfortunately chances are there is a player at the table that has or will decide to memorize a chunk of the so useful they are practically cheating words, or one of the other issues will rear its ugly head. Scrabble should only be played while drinking heavily and only after long periods of not having played it.

The way to play scrabble is to decide right away if you are going to allow words like "AA" and those do-re-mi words.  If you are playing with those words, you are playing a very competitive and interesting game that still feels cheap because you are playing things that aren't really words in the commonly accepted definition.  If you aren't playing with those potent two letter words that unlock big scoring combos, you have integrity but the game is boring.

A "classic" board game but not one of my personal favourites. There is too much potential downtime in the game or "analysis paralysis" as I prefer to call it.

You aren't necessarily rewarded for longer or more obscure words and yet a 2 or 3 letter word can give you over 30 points (with the right letters of course, and placed right).

Also, if you play with someone who knows words like "Qi" (yes, this is "chi" as in the Chinese life essence but it's original spelling) then it gets pretty dull as not everyone knows that. Sure, maybe that's the point but it doesn't spell "fun" for me (no pun intended).

This article sums it up for me:

Hey, you know, it's fine.  It challenges you linguistically (sort of, though sometimes it degrades into finding obscure short words, or capping juicy vowels on the board, or sabotaging a bonus square), and it's one of the better classics.

My only complaint about this version is that it's rather hard to keep the board flat; the 'locks' tend to spring loose at the slightest touch.  Or it could just be mine...oh yeah, and removing the tiles is by no means easy on the hands.  The arthritic need not apply!

I still like it. But the more I play it, the more I think topword would have been a better choice. The point per letter system is just broken and the game is too easily "blocked" due to the lack of flexibility in reusing the words.

This is probably the ultimate wordgame. I play them way too few.

However since there are squares which generates double or triple the word value, laying the longest or most beautiful word doesn't automatically generates the most points. And then the chance exists that you pull characters with which it is very difficult to put a word on the board anyway.

Scrabble holds a special place in my heart. Not only have I grown up with it but my parents also have. I first got into scrabble when my father told me about the bets him and his friends used to do. Whoever got the lowest score had to chug a gallon of water and then immediately take ipecac. Hearing this intrigued me so I played a game and soon I was hooked. As a child, scrabble was my game. Not even Phonics could contain my massive vocabulary which I soon formed due to playing so many times.

Board positioning, tile dumps via inefficient word plays, knowing when to swap, and the all-important 2 and 3-letter words.  Vocab not as much as you'd think, although spelling is a requirement.  An enduring classic despite its somewhat awkward transition between casual and competitive play, but I find that aspect fascinating.  I suggest checking out "Word Wars" on Netflix streaming, and playing the official Scrabble app on Facebook (also via iPhone).  "Words With Friends" on the iPhone has a different and IMO problematic board layout which, for example, has triple-letter and triple-word within a few spaces of each other.

A classic and good word game.  Due to letter distribution, the players' vocabulary is often limited to "scrabble words" - a collection of unusual and little used short words.  Despite this, it is a highly playable game that does not suffer the same faults as other 'classics'.  Good for teaching or reinforcing both vocabulary and spelling.  [GTI Code: TPSL]

Scrabble is my favorite word game. If you do not like Scrabble try the following:

1) Play against one opponent.
2) Use a chess clock, 25 minutes per side.
3) In your free time, memorize lists of large words that are formed from common letters. 

Doing these three things moves the game from tedious to glorious.

One of the first board game I played.  Still fun, but I don't like the seemingly arbitrary selection of words in the Scrabble dictionary. I also don't like how people who memorize all the 2 and 3 letter words have a huge advantage. To get around that I printed a list of all 2 and 3 letter words and put it in the box for everyone to refer to. That "za" is an acceptable word (short for Pizza) is ridiculous.

Once you get a taste of what good Scrabble play is like, you'll never play it "casually" again.  Learning the 90+ 2-letter words (not as hard as you'd think) will DRAMATICALLY improve your play , as it allows you to hook words so much more easily. Playing a triple-triple (bridging two triple word scores) is one of life's sublime thrills.

Probably the best of the 'classic' proprietary board games. My mother loves to play this game, and has a copy from 1981 with a plastic turnstile board and wooden tiles (they don't make it like they use to). Played it with my mother and grandmother as kid; I didn't like it. Now, that I can spell properly (sort of) and I've got a BA in linguistics, I can play better and see the appeal of the game.

I wouldn't play with a dictionary and word list for 2 and 3 letter words. Yeah, it's going to take 1-2 hours, but it an enjoyable enough evening.

RATING: 8
I prefer with the optional substitution rule, but it can make turns much longer.  Before you place on your turn, you can substitute letters one by one from your hand to the board as long as the board always remains fully valid after every exchange.  Any exchange can be challenged and can terminate the turn immediately.  An old unchallenged word is valid.  You'll probably want a slotted board.

Also, the respell rule: if a player declares the meaning and spelled it wrong, they can fix it if they have the right letters.  The challenger is not penalized.

Another 'every home' sort of game (like Monopoly) but much more deserving of its place. I'm quite literate (I'd like to think) and enjoy playing about with words, but I don't find actual word GAMES that engaging and prefer to play other types of games.
Another trouble is that "serious" players just rote learn lists of useful words (for Scrabble) without any knowledge of the meaning of those words. This gives them an enormous advantage over casual players (preventing the 2 player classes from having meaningful games together) and it breaks it as a Vocabulary game, which I'm sure was the intent of the original design.

RATING: N/A
The fact that it appeals to different people for different reasons is both a feature and a bug.  Feature: since it's probably the best game in the American canon, you'll probably be able to enjoy it when people with narrow game interests come over.  Bug: trouble brews when not all the players appreciate the others' mindsets.  Just make sure everyone's on basically the same page.

The problem with Scrabble is that the big step to getting good at the game is memorizing word lists - i.e. two and three letter words, words that use Q without U, Z-words, etc. This for me is pretty dull work compared to actually thinking about or playing a _game_.

A classic game that's a favorite in my family.  But, I've never gotten the appeal of it; the strategy aspect is fun, but the word-building part?  Either you basically need to be a dictionary, or be allowed to use one, or those with good vocabularies and spelling will wipe the floor with you.

I hate this game. Whenever I get talked into playing it I loathe the time wasted. I recognize that others love it and it is well designed, but for some of us it is pure torture.

I was talked into playing this recently and although it wasn't pure torture it was partial torture and reminded me of why I don't care for this game.  I will only play it if my wife really insists, and then only to preserve marital relations.

RATING: 6
Scrabble is enjoyable on its own, but the variants 'Speed Scrabble' and 'Pirate Scrabble' are also good fun, and I generally prefer using the Scrabble tiles to play these games rather than normal Scrabble. I dislike that Scrabble tends to suffer from 'analysis paralysis' worse than most games I play (at least in Chess I can reasonably predict what my opponent might do and plan a follow-up while he thinks; in Scrabble it's virtually impossible), and I am not a fan of 'Scrabble words' (words that no one except Scrabble players has any idea exist). Nevertheless, I do enjoy playing from time to time -- as long as the game moves quickly. (2009-03)

This classic word game is average at best.  I don't like the way it benefits the memorizer.  But one-on-one games with my wife are not bad.  That really seems to be the key, getting players who are all evenly matched.  Unfortunately, even then, the luck of the draw can influence who wins a little too much.  I will continue to play occasionally with Rikki, but beyond that I doubt it.

A classic game, great for the word worms in your group. However it rarely hits the table with us for some reason or another. Perhaps due to the down time, the "is that legit?" moments or other times where one just felt constrained.

RATING: 4
This is a much more clever, more sophisticated design of a game than any of the other games I've ranked low. The trouble is that so much tedium inevitably is created when the game hits the table. I have a decent vocabulary, but I, like most, find myself playing very boring words and end up with an unimpressive whole experience. The odd "coup" word play just isn't enough to save the experience. Minutes can drag to hours as each player tries to make the most out of their turn.

On the other hand, most also know what it takes to be competitive at this game - learning the two letter and three letter words. Advanced players will invest time towards learning other word sets. Players that do this will wipe the floor with any other player and will, yes, find a true challenge against other similar players. However, I can't help wondering if these few players wouldn't be rewarded so much more by putting the same time investment into fundamentally better games. I've enjoyed reading books about competitive Scrabble and this was a thought I couldn't dispel the entire time.

Personal tastes - I don't like word games. Nothing particularly bad about this game, other than you are making words, suffers from downtime, and then there's the whole check it in a dictionary. But more likely I'd end up playing this in a family situation - and it's better than pictionary (shudder). But I'd always suggest Qwirkle over this, and if we have to play a word game at least Boggle has a timer ...

A true classic in every sense of the word. How many board games originally released before 1950 still get regular play? I've been playing this for over 20 years.
PROS: Definitely makes you think.
CONS: Bad draws. Downtime. (Unless you consider taunting your opponent on his/her turn a strategy.) 

Trivia: Most tourneys are won by non-English speakers who've memorized 100,000+ words (funny but true).

Any game that is still being played 60 years later can't be that bad (oh wait, monopoly is about the same age).  I think for this game to be played well, requires players to study esoteric short words that the normal person will never know.  However, played at an average level between normal adults, I think the game is fun and close with a touch of tactics and a good dollop of luck.  While I wouldn't ask to play it, I wouldn't say no either.

Not sure why I'm holding on to it... keeping it as my one word game.

I wonder if Jonathan is old enough to play this?

If you want a game about words, don't play Scrabble. Frankly, it's a game about pattern recognition more than anything: a good Scrabble player will memorize obscure combinations of letters that form really bizarre words which have no practical function but are worth a lot of points or can get rid of difficult letters. For example, do you know what "qat" means? A good Scrabble player will have that word in their repertoire to get out a sticky situation in the game, but God help us all if anyone can use that in a sentence without having a dictionary definition on hand.
At the same time, Scrabble is a useful teaching tool for promoting vocabulary and spelling: I spent many, many hours over the years playing this game with my mom, and at the risk of trivializing, I had great spelling and vocabulary when I was a kid.

The problem is that you can play this game casually, or you can become manic and memorize all sorts of quasi-words and practice your anagramming -- but if you're in between, if you're starting to memorize lists of 2-letter words, then it isn't that interesting until you've mastered it. Plus you can no longer play with casual players -- they get angry at you (and at the game) if you say QAT is a word.

[b]Classic Word Network:[/b] The first board game we owned. Since getting caught up in "hobby games" Scrabble hasn't seen a lot of play, but we played a game over Thanksgiving (4p) and I remembered what a great game it is with well-matched players. Paradoxically, I think the "trick" words (two-letter words, q-words without u, etc.) help keep this from being a vocabulary beatdown - you don't need to know a lot of them. With some of those, and the board layout, it becomes just as much about placement as vocabulary. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Most classic board games do not hold up. Monopoly and Risk deserve credit for being innovative in their own day, but they are grotesquely flawed compared to the boardgames of the 2000s. 

Scrabble is different, however. Here we have a game made in the 1940s that is still quite playable. In fact, it's a genuinely good game.

I should clarify that I am talking about 2-player Scrabble. I don't recommend Scrabble with 3 or 4 players. The amount of downtime between turns becomes tedious (and it is impossible to plan your turn in advance, since the board will have changed in the meantime.) Moreover, 3 and 4-player Scrabble have an unfortunate dynamic in which player A makes a moves that scores well, but at the cost of opening up the board for player B, who also scores well. Player C gets screwed.

2-player Scrabble, however, is free of such issues. And it plays quite well! First and foremost, there is obviously the fun puzzle of assembling high-scoring words from your tiles. But there's much more to Scrabble than that. The highest-scoring play is not always the best one, because it might open up the board for your opponent to score even higher. You must choose between aggressive and defensive play.

The "leave"--the tiles left behind on your rack after you play your word--is also an important strategy consideration. It is vital to have a good leave, which again might mean not playing the highest-scoring word you can. You want to keep a combination of letters that give you a good chance of being able to make a strong play next turn. Ideally, you want to be able to use all your letters at once for a 50-point bonus. Therefore, immediately dumping or exchanging unusual letters like Q and X is often a good strategy, because owning these tiles will make it very difficult to get the bonus.

I have a couple complaints about Scrabble which keeps its rating a bit short of greatness. First, there is a substantial luck element regarding what tiles you draw. The tiles are not at all balanced, and games between skilled players are very often decided by who drew the better letters from the bag. In some ways, the letters tend to naturally balance out; if player A is getting all the vowels, for example, then player B is probably flooded with consonants, and neither is in a great situation. But in some ways, they don't. One player may well get both blanks, which is a huge advantage. And if your opponent just happened to draw the perfect letters for an opening bingo, you're way behind and there's nothing you can do about it. 

More annoyingly, high-level Scrabble demands a ton of memorization. It is vital to know the forty-odd 2-letter words (many of which are never used in everyday English). That's not too great a task, but to be really good you've got to memorize 3-letter words and the most common 7-letter words as well. Anyone who has done all this memorization will easily crush anyone who hasn't. I find this element of Scrabble skill quite tedious. 

Nonetheless, Scrabble is clearly a good game overall, with a much more satisfying strategic element than one would expect in such an old game.

My mom played scrabble relentless when I was little, often playing solo.  She still plays solo today (too bad I can't get her into so many other games...).  We're both so good that my wife won't play with me (I don't blame her).  However, my mom claims I always beat her (not true as I have the game statistics to prove it), so she has started to complain about everything, and games have become less fun over the years.  I still always play this with her, though.  This is classic that deserves its accolades.

No game, not even the heaviest Eurogame I own, freezes me with crippling AP quite like Scrabble. Each turn you spend minutes planning your move before someone inevitably takes the letter you need. Then you have to come up with something on the spot. Unfortunately for me, this only makes me take longer. Eventually everyone gets mad at having to wait so long, so I give up and pick a word like "rat," collect a measly three points, and after repeating this process for two hours end up in last place... again. I do not like this game.

Wow, how did I ever rate this game a 6? I must have been out of my mind. This is an awesome classic game that has shot up in my opinion since I've started to play semi-regularly, and especially since reading Word Freaks by Stefan Fatsis, a must-read for any gamer (Scrabble fan or otherwise). I've managed to double my average score without learning new words. The current rating of this game on BGG is an atrocity; Scrabble stands with the best of modern games.

Old-style game. Try play English on the German board and vice versa. Bloody frustrating. But then, that's not one is supposed to do! :p Had good fun playing this on sailing trips with a travel version. Two weeks of this however has satisfied my wish to play this for quite some time.

Funny having those arguments about funny words. Particularly funny with German as German with its ease of creating new composite words lends itself well to word creation. Though one ends up with very odd and funny words. The trick is then to pull off a convincing explanation of the term! :)

This is kind of like a trivia game in the sense that it simply tests your vocabulary (and spelling). 

In Québec this isn't all that awesome because of how often we play games with anglophones and francophones at the same time, giving one side or another an advantage, depending on what language you play in.

To add to it, the advantage also goes to the person who has memorized the q without u words and the key two and three letter words.

Despite having a lifelong passion for language, I've never been a big fan of Scrabble.

The main issue for me is that while I am a very verbal person, I am not a very visual one. Trying to figure out where to place tiles to try and hit multipliers, etc, is just not intuitive or fun for me. Many other word games have addressed this in ways I like (i.e., doing away with a board entirely.)

Combined with the inherent frustration of luck of the draw and fiddly endgame scoring, this ends up as an average-at-best experience for me.

I'll play if offered because I find spelling so much fun, but I'm unlikely to ever suggest it myself.

RATING: 7
Very deep game with as wide a range of skill levels as you would find in deep euros like Tigris & Euphrates and only slightly less depth than traditional games like chess, bridge and go.  Like the games I have just mentioned, Scrabble rewards study, practice and a calculation of probabilities.  All of these outside-the-game skills turn some people off but, there is no denying that Scrabble is one of the greatest games; with the amount of practice and study that you can devote to this, it is nearly a sport.

Weaker players cannot beat a stronger player.

The fine quality of Scrabble is that it can be played at different levels with different people.  It can be light family fun with your 8-year old, a party game with a couple of buddies, and off-puttingly vicious with your grandmother.

It is not really about how many words you know, but more about the way you place the words on the board to best effect. 

Although meant as a game for more than one player it can also be played as solitaire.  The fun in this is trying to play the premium squares to best effect and beating your previous scores.

RATING: 6.5
When I first started playing Scrabble, I naively thought that every turn I should be making the longest word I could.  What it really involves is making good use of the premium squares (or preventing your opponents from using them), keeping track of letter distributions, saving up for those bingos, and remembering lists of ridiculous two-letter words that you never use in real life.  A decent game, but I simply cannot be bothered to memorize the word lists you need to truly boost your game.

It depends on how you play. I would certainly never play with people who would memorize 2 and 3 letter words - there is a story in Word Freaks where a guy plays a 7-letter word right under another one to make a bingo and 7(!) 2-letter words. Yikes! - and as a word game it is just OK. The board play is nice though and some serious defense can be played. The hand management is also really tricky. You need to play a lot of inefficient words to keep good bingo combos in your rack.

When played with people of equal skills, this game is quite nice, though you can still be screwed by the luck of the draw (if you get the letters Z, X and C you will have a hard time as there are VERY few words in the Danish vocabulary containing those letters). It can drag a little as people try and analyze many different options, which they obviously should, so I’m not complaining about AP here, it’s just that the game can run a little long. It’s a game I will occasionally play if I’m in the right mood and play with the right players, but I will probably suggest many other games before this classic.

RATING: 8
Classic word game that is perfect for couples. Requires patience. Knowing the two-letter words is essential for high scoring. I recommend playing with a 3-minute timer (or better yet, a chess clock). Playing with 3 or 4 players is fine, but it adds more downtime to the game, especially with 4. The law of diminishing returns is firmly in effect. When Hasbro first acquired Scrabble, they branded it as Milton Bradley, but later transferred it to Parker Brothers.

I'm very entertained by some word games but don't play them often.

Many of my board gaming friends dislike word games, which doesn't help.

Not suitable for LoB.

I do love a good game of Scrabble, but only in French: to be able to play in English, you need to learn a long list of stupid 2-letter words nobody uses in real life; in French you can play by using normal 2-letter words everybody knows (there are loads of them in French). Well, to be fair you do have to learn a few stupid words for French Scrabble too, mainly to use the W and the other hard letters, but the list is small compared to English.

This is a letter-combination-recognition game. Those with vocarious appetites for reading, or a decent vocabulary, should do well. The scoring system adds an additional strategic layer to the word choice and tile placement. I have also played the variant where players must define the words they form, without resorting to a dictionary. My wife and I usually  play without scoring - we just try to use all the tiles. (See also: Upwords.)

I'm not good at word games, and my general enjoyment of games in the genre is not high because I feel that I can't compete, at all in them, and have no ability to come up with words. It's not just that I'm bad, my brain lacks the wiring to actually play the game. On occasion, my brain clicks with this one, and I can at least play it though.

I used to rate this a 3, but after having played it quite a few times lately I have to inch this one up to a 4. This is still not the type of game that I'm ever going to request, but as mainstream fare goes it is pretty good, and though there are many games that I enjoy more, I am willing to play this with people who like it. The trick is to play not just for large words, but to the value of the squares on the board. Short words, which are easier to come up with anyway, hence, are actually better in many situations because they are harder for the other player(s) to build off of. 

The thing I dislike the most in this game is the ambiguity concerning what a legal word is though, and I also hate how crap like "EN" is a legal play, but still, for an older title it's not too bad.

A piece of derivative, heartless, souless crap like Caylus has a 8+ rating on the Geek but Scrabble languishes with a sub-7 rating.  Whatever.  We'll see what game is still being played in 20 years, I'll bet it won't be anything published by Ystari.  Scrabble will always be one of my absolute favorite games, its strength lies in the fact that it is _fun_ with players of any disposition and offers anyone with any inclination towards words a great challenge.  There really is no need to ever play any other word game- this is the best one ever published and it will never be topped.  Now, bear in mind that one of my prized possessions is an etymological dictionary, so I'm sort of predisposed to this type of thing.  A real, bona fide classic regardless of the snobs who think it's crap just because it wasn't published in Germany first.

A reasonable game for encouraging vocabulary expansion in older children but it really isn't interesting interesting enough to motivate them. But it does cross the generations. I'm not a fan of the plastic pieces in recent editions. I much prefer the old wooden pieces.

My vocabulary skills absolutely suck, so perhaps that's why I never like this game.  Or Boggle, now that I think about it.  Any game that has to do with words I avoid like the plague.  Wonder why my brain just can't do the word thing.  Numbers are much more my thing.  Perhaps that's why I like Sudoku (I know, it's stupid, but it's much cooler than crosswords in my opinion).

As a contest, it's decent, except that it really rewards players who know the Scrabble dictionary (memorizing all the 2-4 letter words), rather than an actual working vocabulary. As a game, I think it would actually be more fun to play with free access to a dictionary, but not on your turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pretty boring. Largely an exercise in using the two-letter word and, unless your draws are lucky, managing your number of vowels versus your number of consonants. The Scrabble Dictionary allows some foreign words, but not others. Boggle is better, partly because it prohibits short words.

Scrabble is fairly simple and provides a nice test of one's linguistical skills, but the ever present dictionary to settle disputes over the correct spelling of words puts me off. Nevertheless, it does have its merits (letter games are rare), and the utter joy of completing a word with crazy letters on the triple word score square has to be experienced at least once in one's gaming career.

But it is a true classic. I play this with my mother almost every week. And I am surprised, how many new words we still come up with - how many words we wrench out of some hidden memory banks of our brains - looking at it and saying: wow - I have not used this word in ages!
Wonderful game ... and I guess it might be one of my most played games of all time.

Really tests your vocubulary. I usually play a more fast-paced version where you skip the board and everyone builds their own crossword in front of them. Everyone starts at the same time with five letters, the first player to fit all in a crossword says go and all players immedeatly takes a new letter. Whenever a player fits the last letter in he says go. You may rearrange your crossword if you like and have time to. The game ends when no more letters remains. Count the score, negative score for unused letters.

One of the great classics.  While I liked Scrabble for a long time, it suffers from one of the same drawbacks as Chess:  the better player (wordsmith) will win virtually every time.  So, still good for evenly matched players, but  since I tended to win all the time, it disappeared from our table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun game of anagrams, with added letter-weighting and positional factors to consider. The common comment (usually a complaint) that good play is too heavily reliant on the memorisation of obscure words, particularly of the two-letter variety, is certainly valid, though, to a certain point, I see it as a positive encouragement to learn new words.

Recorded gameplay history for: Challenge mode Webster dictionary copyright 2004 based 2 player scrabble irl. 

Much prefer words with friends 2 letter non challenge Scrabble as far as gameplay, but much prefer the mood and atmosphere of this Scrabble overall. 

Wordbiz or isc was bad for living creatures. The only reason I played speed scrabble there instead of a regular kind was to prevent you yokels from cheating like mad. Cheating ruins some of your own fun as well as mine. At that intensity level winning is more wrong somehow. It becomes something it shouldn't. I don't really believe in it.

Production: The deluxe version is great, with a spinning board, and ridges to hold the tiles in place.  Play: I never liked this game until I began reading Fatsis’s book, at which time I developed a great interest.  But I haven’t played since I finished reading the book.  The game, from my perspective, is flawed in the same way all word or trivia games are flawed, in the sense that it is impossible to ever know all the ‘rules’, where each ‘rule’ is an admissible word.  As rules systems go, Scrabble has the most complex system of any game.  I also find it difficult to enjoy playing casually, when I know that more than any other game, this game requires extra-game experience (in the form of studying word lists) to truly excel, since one will learn few words during a game.  I’m not good at anagramming either.  But I must confess to having enjoyed the game up until I became too frustrated with my own imperfect play.  (3+0+3) (20 plays)

My dislike for this game comes not really from the design, which is excellent, but the way it plays in practice. People tend to spend a long time on their turns as they mentally line up their letters in all the combinations that fit on the board, leaving me bored when I already know what I'm going to play.
I often end up playing this with people who have memorized all the two-letter word combinations from the official "scrabble dictionary", and it's no use arguing with them. Generally they don't even know what most of these words mean, they just know they're in the dictionary. It's essentially a rules supplement that isn't distributed with the game, and it takes the fun out of it for me.

It's the classic word game, but I just don't get why my friends play it so often; I hate it. It's so slow waiting for turns -- I'd have just as much fun playing Battleship, at least then the pacing wouldn't feel like I'm stuck in molasses. Quick, let me memorize a bunch of useless 2 and 3 letter words so I can always win. If my friends and family didn't seem to like it so much, then I'd be just as happy to never see it again.

Scrabble gets a bad rap, which is sad and unfair.  The first of two main reasons people don't like it is because they think it's a family game.  There's a lot of strategy to Scrabble -- in terms of placing tiles so that they only benefit you -- that gets lost if you aren't serious enough about the game.  The other main complaint is that it is somehow "unfair" if someone knows (or has memorized) more words than someone else.  How this is any different from memorizing chess openings or go patterns is beyond me.  Many people don't take Scrabble as seriously as they should because it's "just" a word game, and that's really a shame, 'cause those people are missing out.

This game is meant for two players only.  For more, play Super Scrabble instead.

Let both players use the two-letter word list during the game, and there will be much less chance of the board locking up.  You'll also score more and eventually know all the twos without assistance.  To really improve your word knowledge, play with friendly challenges only.

There is plenty of room for strategy in this game, but defense is overrated.  The 3W space isn't always the most valuable.  Consider your future turns as much as or more than your current one.  There is always a best play; winning this game is more about consistently finding that play than about getting good letters; the luck of the draw exists (approximately 10%), but wisdom and patience will usually prevail.

RATING: 5
Note in advance: I'm reviewing the Dutch version of Scrabble, but I'm sure the game plays the same in English. 

The game of Scrabble has a nice concept, and being a word game it provides a welcome variation to the thousands of strategy games around. Because of this, I'm particularly sad to say it suffers from some serious design flaws.

Scrabble suffers considerably from the luck of the draw. Good luck scoring if you only have pulled vowels. When drawing, you need to be lucky enough that your new letters are compatible with the words on the board. There is also the considerable impact of the word played by the previous player. Hopefully you are lucky enough he or she put just that letter on the board you needed to be able to make a good score, or even better if he/she grants you the access to a 2-times-word-value field. It can also work the other way round: you see a great chance for a great word, just to find your predecessor blocking it by putting one letter in the wrong spot.

When I start playing Scrabble, I'm always eager to pull off some really great words, words nobody would ever think of. However, it is nearly impossible to form long words. I never ever succeeded in using my 7 letters to put an 8-letter word on the board, and in the average game, words longer than 5 letters are rare. This means that Scrabble allows only a very small part of the total vocabulary, preventing creativity considerably.

There is also the ever present problem of judging whether a word is valid or not. Usually some reference dictionary is used for this. This makes the game more like knowing what words are listed in that dictionary than knowing the most words. Additionally, there's the problem with abreviations. In our rule set they are disallowed, forbidding for example the often used acronyms "IQ", "TV" or "GSM". This is nonsense, but it also kills almost all options for using the special letters such as Q, X and C (again: in the Dutch version). However, inverting that rule would be equally bad, because this would introduce too many short word possibilities.   

So in summary, Scrable is a luck fest forcing you to put annoyingly short words on the table, under the ever present threat of the dictionary disqualifying your beautiful and perfectly valid word. What a pity!

This is a great classic and when playing against challenging players, like spouse and father-in-law, for instance, I could play on and on.

Pretty addictive.

Yes, some games you just seem to not getting the right letters, but you need to spread the luck on the long haul...

Plus, it does educate ! At least in French. Never played it in English.

Classic word game.  I played a couple games recently and I was surprised at how much I still liked it.  I think it may score a point for sentimental reasons as my grandmother and I used to play in the early 80s.  My recent game saw the formation of words such as "qi" and "ja".  I think that's a weakness in the game.  I have no problem with those with the best vocabulary having an advantage.  But I think regular players just memorize these ridiculous words that are in the scrabble dictionary...words they have no idea what they mean and have never even seen them used in a sentence.  Q and J used to be hard to use...now they are much easier and are probably valued too high.

I used to enjoy this game more as I have a good vocabulary and am good at finding strategic places for words, but once I realized that higher level play mainly consists of using short, strange words that you only know in order to use them in Scrabble, it lost some of its appeal.  Also, it can be frustrating to play with unskilled players as they will leave no places to build onto, and will take forever to place a word.

Update (played again after a long break): Way too much downtime in a 4 player game!

Idea:
Try to make words out of your letters and place them on board connecting others. Score more points from harder letters or longer words.

To whom:
Those who like to puzzle out words out of letters. After many games (50+) best words are already known (finnish version 'G' is somewhat hard to play and 'GNU' easy to waste that 'G'. So in a long run some 'common' words start to be on board each time.

There are two levels Scrabble is played at: Casually and Seriously.
I rate the casual game as a 5.
If you have a knack for words, and enjoy learning words that are simply good for word games (e.g. cwm, zarf, ecu, aalii), then Scrabble takes on a completely new form.
Imagine a battlefield where the possible legal formations number in the hundred thousand. Your success depends on how well you can weave your given soldiers into the most powerful formations. Each letter takes on a certain persona. 
c's and v's always overstay their welcome. 
i's are like inlaws and seem to show up in annoyingly large groups.
q is like a beautiful woman. You could score big or get taken to the cleaners.
s's are good friends who can get you out of almost any bind.
Blanks are the bingo makers. Don't play your blank unless you're playing a bingo.

Great classic game.  I enjoy the game, and it is a classic, so I rate it a eight (8).  I probably decide to play it more like a seven (7), since I always lose with my limited vocabulary.

I have a Standard Version and a Deluxe Version, along with the Official Scrabble Dictionary.

The standard version doesn't have as nice components and features as the deluxe version, but it is cheaper, and fits better in the closet.  It can be bought everywhere. The deluxe version has nicer components, but it is harder to store and transport, and costs more.  I like them both the same; generally the deluxe for at home, and the standard to take somewhere.

I have played this game many times and surprisingly do fairly well at it. I know there are alot of people who love this game, but I'm not one of them. It's a pretty prosaic game for me, but I won't object to playing it if it's requested. It might get a higher ratingn if I didn't seem to pick the Q letter at the end of every game after all of the U's have already been played.

Scrabble is a great game and deservedly be of the classics.  I've had some great battles with my wife over the years and love the feeling of using all my letters and getting the 50  point bonus.  We have a house rule that you need to be able to use the word in a sentence so this rules out all those dodgy 2 letter words some people come up with.

Don't like word games to begin with, I'm not very good at them and find the thought involved to win not all that interesting.  

As with Trivial Pursuit, those who are simply better at the ability to remember words will end up winning.  I'm someone who always has something on the tip of my tongue and so in the end I'm always losing.

I would be willing to play if we were allowed to try and find words in the dictionary to use while playing.  Rather than it being a game about who is most adept at language would instead be something more about creative expression.  It would be more fun to see what kinds of bizarre words people could pull out of the dictionary than using the old tired words we all know.

2015-08-10 : It’s the mid-nineties and during our holidays my wife and me criss-cross Europe from Portugal to Hungary in our little car, sleeping in our 50 square foot tent. Everything we took along had to be light and compact so I bought a travel edition of Scrabble.

Our games of this were tense – often there was just a couple of points between us, but my wife still won 2/3rds of them. I’ve been known to do a little victory dance on those rare occasions I really beat her significantly and whenever an epic win happened pictures were taken of the board and the score.

20 years later and that same travel edition, with some tiles really faded, is still the game we have to take along on holidays – it’s the only time of the year the game gets played, but the competition between us is as intense as ever and my rare victories still as sweet.

While I respect that the game makes you think and encourages good vocabulary (which is something sorely needed in this day and age) I can't say I really enjoy it.  Grabbing random letters from a bag and trying to make a word just doesn't really appeal to me.  I'm sure there is strategy to it based on using what's on the board and what letters you have, but I'm sure there are better word games out there.  I don't think I'll actually discover them because I'm not really into word games.

Scrabble is brilliant. A real gaming experience - a wide vocabulary of 'big words' has less to do with winning than understanding the board and the game mechanics, and there is huge potential for tactical play - using up triple word spaces in order to prevent your opponents from doing so, etc. If you don't like scrabble, there's something wrong with you.

Thank you to the person who invented the board with the raised edges around each square.  [There are about *** other games for which a similar board would be a welcome addition.]

This was interesting:  "Scrabble may be the single most popular board game in the U.S. -- it's estimated that one in three American homes have a Scrabble board on a shelf somewhere. The game was invented by out-of-work architect Alfred Butts in the 1940s. His initial idea was to create a hybrid game combining elements of anagram and crossword puzzles popular in the era. Butts originally named his game "Lexiko" and determined the relative point value of individual letters by painstakingly counting letter frequencies in the Saturday Evening Post and the New York Times."

It's a classic because it's awesome.  One on one battle of smartypantsieness!  If you win -- go ahead and gloat, it's Scrabble after all and you are the smartypantsiest of all the smartypantsies!  I imagine the war-like attitude, honed and wielded by serious players, scares off many lesser adversaries.  If someone is whipping up on you too badly, find a weaker opponent.  Scrabble has a competitor made just for you.  It's your job to find them.  And when you find them spend your days and nights working on a strategy to crush and ruin them.  I've got my eye on a new version.  The old one is worn, abused and discarded.

The classic word game, OK if I'm in the right mood and with the right people!  Playable as "Words With Friends" on the iPad.

We own a newer travel edition of this classic word game.  

Recommended variants:
1. Speed Scrabble (also called [gameid=601] or [gameid=4975]) (some score the leftover tiles as minus points, other score the tiles played as in regular Scrabble; some draw one tile at "Go", others draw two tiles.).
2. [gameid=10210], also called Crossword Squares or Maven in the public domain (also [gameid=97999] from Crown & Andrews, see my [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/707082/enders-comprehensive-pictorial-overview-a-fun-word]pictorial review[/url]).  Draw tiles and players simultaneously place them in their own 5x5 grid to make point-scoring words.

Also owned: [gameid=9234] - A scrabble type game with cards - but choices are limited and there's little room for creativity.

Play online with iPad using "Words With Friends"

Just recently played this at the request of my wife during a recent power outage from Hurricane Irma.  It still had the score sheet from our last play about 8 years ago in it, where I came in last place.  I did manage to take first on this play, however I was quickly reminded why it has taken 8 years to pull this one to the table again.  It played very slowly and it seemed like all 4 of us spent more time arguing about what would count then we did laughing.  Although to be fair we did have a few chuckles over some of the attempts.

It's a solid game, but kind of boring.  There is a luck factor I'm not too fond of, but my ENORMOUS BRAIN usually makes up for any lousy letters I draw. One thing... if you haven't read the rules lately, remember that you don't get the bonus word points again. Once you've covered something, that bonus is GONE.

I have found that Scrabble is the one game that I really suffer from analysis paralysis. Knowing this, it really starts to detract from my fun of the game, because if I don't find the 'optimal' move, I end up spending 10 minutes looking at the board, or put down a three letter word just to screw with it. I need to play some non-competitive games (which is funny, as most of the people I play this with are casual gamers) to try and relax and just enjoy putting letters on a board.

Playing with the "Official" Scrabble dictionary or an online dictionary makes for a futile and frustrating exercise, as there are too many words in there. I like to stick with something simpler.

Okay, I know it doesn't stand up strategically to newer games. But it is scads more edifying than most, exercising one's vocab and spelling all the while and because of it's root in the English language is easy to teach to anyone who speaks it. I'd never turn down a game.

Scrabble has more to do with tile management and placement than anyone's vocabulary, although the two letter word list is indispensable. I almost never play with the Challenge rule, rather allowing looking up a word for spelling/existence (no browsing!). This policy keeps the newbies interested/happy and ensures that everyone has learned something new by the end.

Man... I suck at Scrabble.  Tracy loves it and kicks my ass when we play.

5/31/2012: Scrabble should stop being considered a "word" game and start being considered what it truly is--an abstract.  Only the best combos win.  Having said that, the available letters need to be redistributed.

A solid classic game. You need a good vocabulary to win the game, but there is also some tactic involved. Not setting your opponents up for a big score and trying to save letters to get the maximum amount of points of them is interesting.

RATING: 4
Ability to do well is completely contingent on your vocabulary and luck in drawing tiles. No vowels? Too bad. This was a staple in the older days, but now the randomness of the letters has changed from a whisper to a scream. A relaxing activity to play with older folk or non-gamers, and there IS a smidge of tactics in placing tiles on the board, but there's not much to hold a gamer's attention especially when there are more interesting word games available. (Read: less randomness)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Before board games, I loved word games. I still love word games, but scrabble is not a word game it's a scrabble-dictionary-word game. 

I really like having to create words with the tiles that you draw, but otherwise, I have no desire to play it, especially with people who suggest it, since usually it means they have the whole dictionary memorized.

Scrabble is boring.  The game isn't broken, but it is uninteresting and limited.  Nothing encourages interesting words or widening vocabulary and playing two letter words to maximise scoring or deny bonus squares is routine and dull- sometimes playing longer or more interesting words is less score-efficient.  When asked if I want to play this, my first reflex thought is 'no'.

German version. Way more fun, tactical, and way less "smartpantish" then the english version. Reason: The German language features a lot of noun and verb flection + compound nouns. So tons of combinations that are funny and score alot of points are possible.

Excellent portable Scrabble game.  But be careful when playing in a moving vehicle like a minivan or a WA State ferry.

The only game that I can _really_ competitive about.  This can actually detract from my enjoyment of the game, as I do not enjoy the frustration and anger.  But there's a reason this game can stir those emotions in me.  It has an excellent mix of strategy and luck.  Skill comes in the form of hand management, vocabulary, and board position.  It helps that the game appeals to people outside the boardgaming hobby, so I never lack opponents.

Still, there's something fun about getting that first rack of tiles and seeing a clean slate in front of you, ready to be built upon solely based on your tiles at hand, your vocabulary, and your skill.

The rotating board in the deluxe version is a terrific idea; alas, the one noticeable thing, having recently played it after many years break, is the amount of downtime in this game.  Combine that with having to clarify 'real' two letter words, and playing against people who from the first move are settng themselves up for 'Oxen' on a triple word, means I don't really find it to be a game of choice in real-time (18/12/08).

No description is really necessary for Scrabble.  It is the ultimate challenge between peoples various caches of words.  Sometimes it's really fun to play ridiculous sounding words, daring your opponents to challenge, all the while using psychological warfare to wear them down.    Sometimes, a simple Gentleman's game is more in order.  Occasionally frustrating, but always well worth the play.  I can't imagine wanting to play this with more than 2 players (3 at the max) as the downtime is simply mind-numbing.

My mum used to kick my butt at this. I don't think I beat her till I was 18. I have a German copy, a French copy, and the deluxe English edition. I have been playing at a Scrabble club, and this is an awesome awesome game for 2 players. Almost all of the players at the club are retired women, and they kick my butt. I realised I have loved this game for 30 years, it probably should be a 10.

My opinion is that this is the great word game of all time, and it's a masterpiece of design. I love anagramming and I love games where you can make great moves and this game combines the two. Study, practice and experience are rewarded so you can devote time outside the game to getting better at it. It's a game that can take as much work as you throw at it.

I would play this game with my great aunt when I was young. The rules state that you cannot use foreign words, and she proceeded to play "vino". Even at that age I knew that was Italian for "wine". I protested and she pulled out her Official Scrabble Dictionary and showed me that vino was in fact allowed.

Too many arguments over inconsistencies in the rules, and now that "za" (slang for "pizza") is allowed, the valuation of the Z is overpowered.

Suck it, Scrabble.

Scrabble is a wonderful game, matching itself to the skill and tenacity of its players.  Casual players will have a ton of fun jettisoning the 'no proper noun' rule and arguing about it, while committed players will find a depth and richness to the game that will keep them practicing for years to come.

Scrabble comes alive best when all players have memorized the two letter words, so be warned.

Winner goes to the person with the biggest vocabulary and best eye at using it with the tiles presented.  My vocabulary is decent, but my ability to spot possible words out of my tiles sucks.

Travel scrabble. Need to enter the edition properly. Not a bad set, but to shut the side with the tiles you have to get them completely flat, which is rather fiddly. Would've been better if they'd made that compartment two tile-width's high rather than one.

The Trivial Pursuit of word games. In this case, the trivia being trivial 2- and 3-letter words that find more use on the Scrabble board than in real life.

This game does nothing wrong.  It's a good game with a solid concept.  I just don't end up enjoying it all that much.  I don't like word games terribly much and it's actually a surprisingly heavy game, not in terms of rules, but with everyone furrowing brows and straining to think of words.  Not that fun to me, but not that bad either.  I think I just end up playing it more than I like.

I used to play with my grandmother, for whom English was her third language (after German and Greek) - and she routinely wiped the floor with me. It was a real rite of passage into adulthood when I started beating her more often than she beat me.

We used to play with a couple of odd rules, like you could take a blank back off the board and use it again if you had the letter the blank represented. But as I grew up she weaned me off house rules and we played properly.

She passed away about five years ago. I miss her.

In adulthood, I rediscovered Scrabble (or rather recontextualised it) by playing High Stakes Scrabble with my girlfriend at University. We had a list of dares - if our combined score at the end of the game was low the loser would have to do an easy dare like doing everyone's washing up; but if our combined score was high the loser had to do something severe. For example, that's where I got my tattoo from (my pen-name in Scrabble tiles on my back). 15 years later we're married with two kids, so that worked.

Yeah, [thing=70323][/thing] is fun, but Scrabble I can see myself still playing when it's 2078 and I'm 98 and there's a second generation colony on Mars and we all eat jellyfish because of the food shortage and we're still talking about how [person=2][/person] won the Nobel peace price for board game design.

Best word game of all time. This is not just a vocabulary contest, folks. Despite rumors to the contrary, memorizing nothing but a list of 2 letter words (There are only 101 and you already know many of them) will make you quite competitive with almost anyone short of a "pro," even should your regular vocabulary be sub par. If you don't want to bother, just give each player a list of the 2 letter words. The added strategy makes such "cheating" worth it, in my opinion. Also, there is much more depth than at first glance concerning word placement, letter use, and the decision to exchange tiles. Truly a masterpiece of game design. 

Note: my 10 rating is largely based on the 2 player version. 3-4 player games are still a blast, but hold a much heavier luck element. With 3-4 players, I'd rate this a 7, but the 2 player game is so good that I still consider the game overall to be worthy of a 10.

I should like this game.  I have an above-average vocabulary, and so I do rather well at this game.  But, it just doesn't do it for me.  Lots of downtime and analysis paralysis, I guess, but that doesn't bother me in other games.  I guess that Scrabble just lacks the spark that I'm looking for in a game.

This is probably my most-played game of all time; only [gameid=463] could give it competition for that title.  (None of my plays for either game are logged, as all were pre-BGG.)  That said, it seems to have fallen out of favor over the last few years, probably due mostly to the way my wife and I tend to play.  We both have to guard against AP in this game specifically, and that can cause it to really drag.

How to rate something as classic as scrabble?  Even though I am annoyed at the english language scrabble is pure language wankery.  I mean that in a good way.

My games of Scrabble are usually played in the company of family and we certainly do not ascribe to the rules of the game (e.g. time limits).

Oh, you memorized the three word dictionary and keep up on the latest two-letter words to be made official? I guess you win. What fun. I don't really like word games anyway, but the whole mindset of this game just bothers me. I will still play it grudgingly (better than nothing) but when I play with the "serious" players, I will always lose, not because of strategy or luck, but because of trivial knowledge of what counts as a word and what doesn't. And in tournaments this is even worse, just memorizing the eight-letter words to clear boards every time. Not impressed. Notice how half the Scrabble champions don't even speak English as a first language? That's not a word game. It's a test of memorization. 
That said, I do like the strategies of whether to play a big word and give your opponents more options, or a smaller one to limit them. 
Finally, one last rant. You can spell letters in this game. That's right. "Cee" is a word meaning "the letter C". Now I know that people will find obscure words and weird Q words with this game, but I'm sorry, a spelling of a letter is NOT A WORD! Even on the exceedingly rare times when one needs to spell a letter, it would be done "C" not cee. I have NEVER seen "cee" used anywhere but on a scrabble board.

RATING: 7
Depends on what dictionary you use.  It's critically important to know all the 2-letter words in the dictionary (e.g. "el", "em", "en", "ex", "xi", "xu", and possibly "ae" and "oe")... And "quiz" only scores 22 points, but "retains" scores 57 because of the 50-point bonus for using all 7 letters.  Make no mistake -- this game isn't about having a good vocabulary or even getting high-point letters, but about doing everything to get that 50-point bonus.

I play this as a 2-player game on Facebook, but I don't record those games on BGG because they take so long (usually one move per player each day).  The ridiculous words in their dictionary:  QI, ZA, and PL!

For me, Scrabble is still a great word game. I recognize that players who have either a better vocabulary, strong positional play, and/or a knowledge of all of the allowed 2-letter words will have a very non-negligeable advantage. However, when parties are somewhat evenly matched (or at least within striking distance), this game works out phenominally. However, with no balancing mechanism, and this rarely occuring it becomes an exercise in watching a leader 'run away' or if you are the leader, leaving the pack behind -- neither scenario is terribly appealing to me.

Yes, I own Scrabble.  No, I do not enjoy Scrabble.  Yes, I have a large vocabulary, and no, I do not feel a need to prove that in this caption.  I do not enjoy so-called word games that are not about meaningful language but merely about arbitrary code sequences.  Please put Scrabble away.  Thank you.

Yearly comment update - no update to be made.

My fiancee and I used to play this pretty often, but not so much anymore.  We played online on isc.ro, and I had gotten used to tournament rules, so that casual people weren't very interested in playing with me.  I wasn't outstanding, but the average person didn't stand a great chance of winning.  It wasn't too fun for me either, so we let it go.

It's still a fun game though, albeit can get a little slow and dry as the junk tiles come out and the board gets full.  I don't see this coming out in our game group, but she and I may still take it out occasionally.

I despise Scrabble, but the game's components can easily be cannibalized for other, better games. For instance, the tile holders can be cut into short segments for use as "counter sleds" which allow a player of wargames to see his own units while his opponent cannot. Scrabble's components are wonderful for other uses as well.

PL: Na przestrzeni ostatnich 10 lat grałem w nią wielokrotnie, gdyż była to jedyna gra, w którą byli chętni grać moi bliscy. W chwili obecnej czuję sie nią trochę przesycony i kolejne rozgrywki nie sprawiaja mi już przyjemności. Nadal zachwycony jestem wykonaniem: po 10 latach nie widać śladów uszkodzenia czy zniszczenia (poza kiepską farbą wypełniającą literki). Nie było chyba lepiej wykonanej edycji.

EN: Over the past 10 years, I played it repeatedly, because it was the only game that my loved ones were willing to play. At the moment I feel a bit oversaturated with this game and don't fell like playing it. I'm still amazed by execution: after 10 years, you do not see signs of damage or destruction (other than paint filling letters coming down). Probably there wasn't better release ever.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a classic word game, and deserves a place in every family cabinet.  The game itself builds word conprehension and spelling skills.  It is accessible on different levels, and can become a cooperative venture (think "High combined scores").  It is fairly quick and easy to explain.  

The game has the benifit of being useful for kids to learn spelling and mathematics.  In fact, this is an educational experience packaged in a fun little game.  

That being said, it is not the rich or deep game experience that you get from higher rated games.  This limits its fun factor a bit, but still makes it a "keeper".

Scrabble is a great, fun time. I enjoy both the more casual way of playing of trying to get the funniest or biggest words, as well as the more competitive way of using tiny, unheard of two letter "official" words. Both ways are fun. This game is a great way to spend an afternoon.

Requires too much thinking for my tastes, but can be fun with the right people.

Update (08/17/10): As I get older, and my vocabulary increases, I find playing this game with the right (i.e. fanatics) people, it can be fun. I recall getting this game when I was like 7 years old, and there it sat on the shelf for decades, unloved. This is NOT a game to get your child; it is not a kid's game in the slightest. If your child has an IQ of 120+, with a extensive vocabulary and loves to play anagrams, well then, by all means get this classic. Upping this to a '7'.

Okay as a light, 'for-fun' word game, but getting deep into it feels more like learning cheat codes (must know all of the 2 letter words and many words with an X,Q, or Z) instead of expanding your vocabulary.

This game is not fun especially with snobby people who know every two-letter word in existence.

Paperback pretty much destroys this game in every way

The low ranking is not so much a reflection on the game but a reflection of my poor spelling and lack of ability to visualise word from a jumble of letters.

A game strictly for those with a large vocabulary. It's hardly exciting, and you'll need the official list of words together with a good dictionary as you'll be dying to know what words like 'zoozoo' mean. It always strikes me that there aren't enough tiles in the set as the game ends with about one quarter of the board empty.

Okay, seriously, STOP ADDING TERMS TO THE DICTIONARY.  No, really.  Just stop.  

So there are some issues with this game: right-left binding, the need for outside knowledge and certainly some AP issues.  But it beats the pants off most mass-market games and calls for a puzzly kind of thinking that I happen to enjoy.

I have a Michael Graves edition set that looks damn fine.  Unfortunately for me, I'm not a big Scrabble fan though I'll play it if coerced.  I find the scoring to be a bit too erratic and the game doesn't really seem interested in rewarding large words instead opting for the weasily "super-duper triple zillion bonus square" option words.  I also hate how challenges work since they're often too costly and therefore encourage sloppiness and in some instances, flat-out lying.  Still, with all that said, it's not that bad...

Not a bad family game, as long as everyone keeps it moving along. We are not at all cutthroat about it--if one of us gets stuck for a play, the others will help find something.

Scrabble’s actually pretty fun when all players are of comparable skill levels, but I have the misfortune of being with a woman who is a Goddess of Word Games and therefore I am routinely, utterly crushed under her boot, helpless, desperately clinging to life.

This classic see's our coffee table a lot late night when guests are visiting.  The 9-tile rules speed up the game but can be brutal (and so fun) for those with a good vocabulary.  What else can one say - it's scrabble.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very good game that fine tunes your english and keeps you thinking, you can set yourself up for a scrabble by saving an "S" or "blank" until letters match up, this can cost you though. 

Update: 6.5 => 7 We always come back to this game so upped the rating, great game that can be played with any type of person.

Update: 7 => 6.5 Came back to this again and it was VERY slow (it felt very slow but really it was the same as usual), it always has been slow which is the worst fault of the game, the downtime in between turns, but now owning much more of many better games than before this is losing its appeal due to this one aspect. 

Update: Played two more games and actually they went along at a good clip (for this game) and finished in maybe 90 minutes. You do need to try and think of words when it is not your turn and you also need to try and find spots to put the words down so this keeps you busy. 

This game can have too much luck when all you pull are really crappy letters all one value or all vowels and even though you can dump, this costs you a whole turn so this is sucks when it happens. 

Tidbit - For years we always played when you have three of the same letter you get to throw one back and pick another if you wanted to. Also, use a timer when playing for 5 minutes max per turn.  

UPDATE:  After getting together with my Mom in which we usually play this we are now totally addicted to a new game which uses only the Scrabble tiles, a houseruled version of Bananagrams which we have played THIRTY times already.  See here:  http://boardgamegeek.com/article/5551939#5551939

I still have fun with Scrabble, but it suffers a bit from the fact that everyone is familiar with the game but not everyone approaches it the same way. (This is exacerbated because it's a game I often play with non-gamers.) If one person is playing for points and board position with others who are simply trying to make fun words, it can either be an exercise in frustration (when someone keep setting other players up for big bonuses) or become very discouraging for the person playing casually (if the score runs away).

After years of a lovely relationship with scrabble (from when I was very young to my early 20s) I moved on to chosing other flavours of gaming, but there's absolutely nothing to criticise in scrabble.

I don't care for this game. Yes I consider my vocabulary to be quite good, but the fact that there are double word score or double letter score spots etc. on the board bugs me as a point of game design.  Plus I don't like people using words they don't know the meaning of, or even the gist of BUT it's in the scrabble dictionary so it counts.  Plus some people have really memorized the 2 letter words and the really odd ones with high point values so it ruins the game for me.  To stronger willed word wizards, play on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love crossword puzzles, word games, and words in general, so a copy of Scrabble will always be on my game shelf. However, I consider it much more a strategy game using letters than a vocabulary game. I've never liked the scoring system that rewards the use of high-value letters regardless of the complexity of the word produced. If the game were really about vocabulary skills, there is no way the word "wax" would be worth 3 times as many points as the word "ennui".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love Scrabble... if I'm playing against my brother... and if we're using a chess clock.  We're a pretty even match and neither of us have tried to memorize the official word list.  The chess clock rules keep the game moving right along to finish in approximately one hour.  For every minute a player goes beyond their 30 minutes, they lose 10 points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A truly great game, a 10 in terms of game design and skill; but only a 6 in terms of me wanting to actually play it. I need to be talked into it. I agree with the classic complaint that needing to memorize words like "qat" is lame; but it gets judged way too harshly here. You'd think it was f'in Candyland! My theory is most BGG are more comfortable with numbers than letters.

An American classic!  The 'Deluxe' turntable is a must have.  Doesn't get played as much as it used to now that our game collection has grown.  We own several different editions of this boardgame as well as video versions for the DS, PSP, and now my Kindle and iPad.  I do, however, always seem to have an on-going game of Lexulous on Facebook.  

"Word Freak" written by Stefan Fatsis is a fascinating book that examines the subculture society surrounding the competitive world of Scrabble.  A very entertaining read.

Best word game I've played; games between people who've memorized lists of two-letter words and people who haven't will be severely unbalanced, however.

RATING: 6
Words With Friends before the Internet. Make words from the tiles drawn, getting points based on rareness of the letters, length of the word, and special squares that add bonuses. Seriously, this is a simple but fun game until you start losing tiles.

BIG PLUS: vocabulary testing, intelligent
BIG MINUS: mental challenge
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT: the world championships have ended

I like standard Scrabble fine, if not up against a Serious Competitive Player who has memorized all the necessary sets of weird words.  But frankly our group tends to use the Scrabble tiles, and not the board, to play Scrabble variants rather than the standard game.

A great game with a bunch of strategy, though the study aspect of it means that I'll never be THAT good at it. I still like playing, though.

Hard to classify the game weight, because it's all dependant on how seriously you take it. But one thing you must do is LEARN THE TWOS!

While I enjoy Scrabble I'm just as easily put off it when I'm braindead and stuck making three or four letter words each turn.  Or when someone takes twenty minutes per turn each turn.  This one gets a bit less play these days because I know the opponents who want to play are also the ones who take f-o-r-e-v-e-r each turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 5
This game is great as long as you aren't playing it in tournaments. I played with someone that "memorized all the two letter words". How ridiculous is that? The point of the game is to show off your vocabulary, and artificially expanding that vocab for the sake of winning defeats the purpose. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The mechanics of the game appeal, but given the fact that this game is based on language, the game often goes in favour of dictionary-worms rather than creative players. This is not such a bad thing, but makes the game a little tiresome when the player starts coming up with words nobody ever uses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
We hates it, hates it, HATES IT!  Loathe the way the game is about forming piddling plurals or three-letter words, rather than flexing your vocab.  If you're going to be offered to play a game, it's likely to be this.  I used to think "maybe it'll be fun this time."  Now I know enough to refuse.

Try playing 'speed scrabble'. We call it 'Take 2'. Everyone starts with 7 tiles and builds their own crossword. If anyone uses up all their tiles they call out 'Take 2'. Everyone takes 2 more tiles immediately and plays continues uninterrupted. When there are no tiles left, call out 'stop' or 'finished'. The player with no tiles left scores 0. All others receive the sum of the scoring numbers on their remaining tiles. Set a target for the endgame. The winner is the person with the lowest total score when this target score is reached by any player.

Word game. Fun and interactive, though can be frustrating. Lot of [b]argument over words [/b]existing and making use of words which aren't typically used (like quixotry). 

Lot of people say they need a dictionary to play. I think its funner if you use common words.The multipliers make the game challenging. I like making long words, but most of the time, a 3x multiplier shorter word will award much more.

Decent strategy game. Probably one of the better classic games out there. Especially if you like words.

I like the game on the social level and for the lot of happy memories my husband and I have had with Scrabble. Well, I guess it is quite a personal factor to involve in a rating, but here you are.

A really top class wordgame. 
Pros: Most people have played before, and there is a highly developed commnity of players if you want to take it to the next level. It's a great brain burning puzzle game and has opportunities for finding eureka moments.
Cons: Prone to causing arguments with those less strict on accepted word lists. It has quite a long play time. It suffers from a mechanic which encourages stalling and defensive play. It plays less well with youngsters and those who speak different languages as their mother tongue.

Unfortunately, with the advancement of games on mobile devices like Words with Friends, there is little space on the table for a game like Scrabble.  Scrabble is still a very good, deep, enjoyable game.  Unlike most mainstreams like Monopoly, or Game of Life, this game is actually FUN.  Just that it has become too tedious to play with a board.  With automatic word check, and no setup / cleanup, electronic versions of this game with network multiplayer, it has taken all the good parts of this game and made it massively accessible.

I would very much love to give this game a higher score, but I think the game has shifted from a form of entertainment to more of a form of educating tool.  I'd suggest this for a young family tutoring kids to better their mastery of the English language.  It would develop skills often lost in this modern age like spelling and grammar.  Although you don't spell sentences, it does help having to deal with words and can often times be asked to put said words in a sentence to prove your understanding of the word.

Rating of 3, I would be reluctant to play this game for fun, but would still have a place in my collection due to special circumstance uses as explained above.

Scrabble is fun for me about twice a year.  Every six months I forget how annoying it is to lose a game where I whip out eloquent 6 letter words, only to be crushed by a constant barrage of 3 letter, double/triple word scores.  Useful vocabulary knowledge makes almost no difference in this game.

It's just not my cup of tea, not because I don't win much but because I really like tactical simulation games, role-playing games, and games with "fate" (ie...dice).

A game that is really about memorizing a list of small words.  The neat thing about it is that amateur players can make it fun by adding psychological elements, turning the game into an event and sometimes a cathartic diversion from relationship issues.

I've always kind of liked Scrabble, but it does take forever. You also have to play with no dictionaries allowed, otherwise it just turns into 30 minute turns with whoever can find the biggest wierdest word as the winner.A funny story is as soon as we got this, the bag for the pieces kind of sucked, and burst open when I tried using it the first time.

Drifted in and out of this for a while, ended up mostly playing it online and asynchronously. Lucky draws make a lot of difference (I liked a suggestion I read somewhere that high scoring letters and blanks should be mentioned on the score sheet to show how lucky that player was), but it averages out if you play it enough.

A classic game that I used to hate, until I re-discovered it on a cell-phone version. When I figured out that it was less about vocabulary and more about strategic word choice and placement, I began to see why it is a tournament-worthy game, and began to enthusiastically try to achieve a 400 point game against the computer. Now I appreciate Scrabble as a necessary part of the game collection.

Tile values are completely out of sync with actual value of the letters.  In particular, "c", "v" are grossly undervalued and "x" "h", "w" are overvalued.  Let us not get started on the "s".  Modern ripoffs of the game are balanced better, so I prefer those versions.

- You should only play Scrabble against somebody with a vocabulary that is equal or higher to your own otherwise the game is not remotely enjoyable. 

[size=12][b]Why I like Scrabble:[/b][/size]
+ I like word games. 
+ The game is easy to teach
+ There is high player involvement (with the 2 players recommendation)
+ The game requires decisions to win the game

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Scrabble:[/b][/size]
- Given the nature and duration of the game you can just make up words until you get a word in the dictionary.
- The replayability could be better. 
- I find other board games like Codenames more interesting.

RATING: 4
In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.

Párok számára ideális játéknak érzem abból a szempontból, hogy mind a férfi-, mind a női agy számára hasonló szintű kihívást jelent, és mindenki hasonlóan próbál boldogulni játék közben. Kifejezetten könnyen tanulható, de jó, ha van a közelben szótár, mert konfrontációra adhat okot, hogy valamely szót elfogadjuk-e, vagy sem. (Én szerencsére a párommal egész hasonlóan éreztem, hogy mely szavakat fogadhassuk még el, és melyeket már ne, csak az "oké" szóról vélekedünk eltérően.)
A játék során könnyen előfordul az, hogy hosszasan elgondolkozik az ember amikor rákerül a sor, ez hátrány. Hátrány az is, hogy a végjátékban frusztráló, hogy semmilyen értelmes szót nem tudunk már kirakni, hiába nézzük akárhogy a táblát és a betűinket (bár ez nem mindig van így, van, hogy semmi gond a végjátékkal).
előfordul, hogy valamelyik játékos folyamatosan használhatatlan betűket húz, míg egy másik játékos meg csupa jót - ez elveheti a kedvet a játéktól.
Összességében üde színfolt a matematika-alapú társasjátékok mellett, örülök neki és szívesen játszom vele. És kíváncsi vagyok merre alakul majd a véleményem a további játékok során.

Jogo divertido, o grande problema é o tempo que esperamos os outros jogadores pensarem.

Uma solução é jogar com ampulheta.

I'll save my rant about how Scrabble is actually a zone-control wargame for later, but this explains the disillusionment of a thousand nerdy adolescents who mistakenly believe victory at the game has anything to do with having a good vocabulary.  This one is a rare classic that actually holds up as being fun to play (looking at you, Monopoly), but it's got its flaws.

The design and layout are part of what makes Scrabble a classic, and the game design, while imperfect, has a ton of replay value. It's also an easy way to pass the time, and while online play has improved it a lot, it's still plenty good in its normal incarnation as a board game.  Worth having around.

This is the classic word game.  Although I really like crossword puzzles, I find only find this okay, and it can drag down even more with analysis paralysis.  Similar to chess, it's difficult and not fun to play with people of different strengths.  Memorizing all of the two letter words (many of which I doubt are real words, which bothers me, as does the near religious devotion to the OSD) gives a significant advantage.

To me, thinking up words feels pointless.  All words are arbitrary.  Language is always evolving.

A classic which everyone knows the basics of play (though maybe not the fine details).  I would not request the game but when non-gamers suggest Scrabble and my willpower is low I submit to them.  The scoring system irritates in some cases and distribution of tiles causes pain but everyone knows it and I like playing games even if there are other games more deserving.

Word games are a category unto themselves, like two player abstracts or wargames, so whether you will be interested in Scrabble or not will depend on how you feel about the idea.  Scrabble, the first major game of the type, is certainly one of the best word games.  The strange letter distribution can be frustrating, though.

My family would play this sometimes, then my old roommate would put me through my paces.  It's nice that there is some clever moves to be made sometimes, but having a good vocabulary (which I do) and being able to spell very well (which I can't always do) are ultimately more important.

I have memories from childhood about Scrabble games going on for days--my Dad would take the whole afternoon doing word research.

The first 35 pages have a great history of the game that is a must read for any Scrabble fan.

A classic word game where you score points based not he values of letter and where you place on the board.  You score 50 point bonuses if you use all seven of your tiles.

I guess Scrabble is pretty much the bar as far as word games go. I enjoy doing crosswords and this sort of feels like that so it's ok. It doesn't really offer a lot after a few plays however and suffers from that ultra competitive faction that memorizes dictionaries but at least those are relatively rare.

Scrabble is neat. My wife really likes this game. I just hate how slow it plays. Some turns take a minute, while others take 5 minutes. If you play with the official rules and bring out an egg timer it works well enough, though there are better word games out there today.

RATING: 7
It's a good game, but it's not one I'll suggest. First, I prefer it with two players. Second, "insider" game knowledge (OSPD/SOWPODS) creates an uncomfortable divide between players of different levels. (This might not be much different than knowing Chess openings, but it feels different. It's more like knowing a "secret" password than tactics or theory.) I've found myself on both sides of that divide at one time or another.

The tiles are useful for lots of word games.

Can be a lot of fun. More of a math game than a word game the way I play it.( We only allow the usual dictionary words but don't use word challenge rules so you are not penalized for poor spelling or for poor vocabulary). If we did allow word challenges  the skill would probably be in knowing which words were in the dictionary used rather than having the best vocabulary because different dictionaries include different words in the English language.

Scrabble is okay, but I prefer SPEED SCRABBLE(7.5).

In Speed Scrabble, you each pick 7 pieces and try to form words/crosswords, like in Scrabble.  The first player to use all their letters says "Draw," and each player takes 2 more letters.  The game continues until all pieces have been taken from the center and one player successfully uses up all his/her letters.  Score as usual:  Count the points in your crossword, subtract letters you didn't use.

Very fast-paced, fun version of scrabble!  Plays in about 3-5 min.

Decent crossword-style game. Still gets mentioned and played after many years, though not nearly as much as in the 90s. Many successors to this game have done things better, or at least in a more fun way.
Still, a lot of house-rules exist for this game to help get around some of its problems, and it's found in practically every store that sells board games.

ADDENDUM: Having thought more on it (and got many more plays in on the classic version, which I've recently acquired), this gets a 6 now. Almost anyone will play it, and it draws upon huge bodies of possible words, so I'll credit it more.

An enduring design, and one my wife enjoys.

Really, this is a great 2-player match of wits, board positioning, rack management, game management and word power.  An easy "8".

With more than 2 players, it's more an activity than a game.  A "4".

But since I have only rarely had to play with more than 2 players, I can give this game an 8 with a clear conscience.

I read an excellent book on Scrabble, which provided insight into the history of the game and the highly competitive tournament scene. It is a fascinating book, but I have interest in playing Scrabble at this level. As a casual game I don't really care for it either. Still, no one can ignore its classic status.

Played sporadically, not more than 10 times.

For me, Scrabble is the ultimate word game, hands-down. No matter how much I improve, there's always more to learn -- and played competitively, it's tense, tactical, and unforgiving.

I have a good vocabulary, and I enjoy the core gameplay -- maximizing points, trying for bingos, and strategic tile placement.

I also like that everyone knows Scrabble, but it's not in the same (un-fun) league as many classic family games; it's a good bridge.

If Words with Friends didn't exist on my phone, I'd probably play Scrabble more.

Doesn't hit the table almost ever.  Played it with my mom and a sister in the way back.  My mom gave me the copy we used to play (1950s edition).  Seems the rules got lost.  But the little fold up game catalog is in there - Scrabble was $3, one of the pricey games that S&R produced at the time.

Also have a modern edition, no idea where it came from.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on mostly 2 players.

I rarely play this nowadays, but before I discovered modern boardgaming, this was my go-to game for years. I like the mix between using words and being a jerk--despite it being a word game, good spatial use of the board is what Scrabble's really about, and to play well you need to block your opponent/deny them good spaces.

Anything above 2 players makes the game very uneven, as good opportunities for scoring are highly dependent on the experience on the person playing before you.

3 / 5 - Good.

There's a lot to be said for scrabble. It works the brain hard and has a nice positional element to boot. The biggest problems are an early variant on "runaway leader" and a horrendous downtime problem when playing with more players. Three is the sweet spot for this - downtime is bearable and it allows an extra person to open up the board and vote on the legality of words!

RATING: 10
True classic, but as 2-player game only and with evenly-matched players. A good player will slaughter a poor one every time regardless of tile draw - and you won't make any friends doing so. Better with the Deluxe rotatable grid board. A chess clock set to 25 minutes per player (the competition limit) certainly makes the game much more tense, but if anything exaggerates the differences in skill level between players.
One additional thing I like about Scrabble: it's easy to find very strong AI to play against (it has this in common with chess). The iPhone app is quite weak,* even on "hard" (I win 60% of the time, and I'm not an especially strong player) - but Quackle is awesome, and I'd be surprised if I win 5% against even the speedy player. So much for luck! 
*The update has an "expert" setting which is better, and I'm down to 40% win rate which is more enjoyable.
Have played a few online games but won 40 or so in a row and found no one even as strong as the computer to play...

This is by far my favourite board game.  I loved learning it using Scrabulous on facebook (now lexulous) I love learning new and unusual words with friends.  Playing it casually, without using the challenge rules is the best for beginnings, and having the 2 and 3 word lists distributed to everyone is also helpful (something they do for official tournements in Toronto, at which I was beaten by 2 old ladies, and some other dude, my all time record is 0-3)  Make sure you have an official Scrabble Dictionary, or pick your own (Urban Dictionary, Websters, Dictionary.com, whatever you feel most comfortable with)  Learning how to block tiles, hook, build on, and becoming better and better at your anagram skills all help.  I'm terrible with Anagrams... but a good memory and knowing where to play the words has kept me fairly competitive.  When I'm playing with someone who is less experienced, I we just agree that if I'm not at least x points ahead by the end of the game, I've lost.  Another great activity is doing word themes.  Trying to play all the words that start with A, and so on.  If you want to know which mechanics have the greatest appeal to me, check out the game Qwirkle, and Bananagrams.  Oh, using timers (each player has one) keeps the games fast.

I have no objection to people being Scrabble fetishists - I just think it ceases to be a game and becomes an undertaking. If that's what floats your boat, that's fine - but only other Scrabble fetishists will enjoy playing with you.

A good game in concept, but devolves into a terrible game of people trying to cheese as many nonwords as possible, especially two letter nonsense words. And it's just getting worse, as they add more nonsense words to the official dictionary.

To be fair, though, even when I played this as a kid in the '70s, half the game was just cheesing nonsense words.

Game in a Nutshell: Score points by laying out words in a crossword type fashion. Or use one of several speed scrabble variants that gets rid of the board and just lets you scramble to make words as fast as you can.

Played as: 2,3,4 players

Pros: You can use the letters only to play speed scrabble which is a few things playing with the board isn't: exciting, quick, and entertaining enough for a few fast rounds. Ranked slightly higher for that reason.

Cons: There's games out there that don't require massive amounts of otherwise useless word memorization to appreciate in its fullest. Also the game drags, too many people take too long to find a word that they're not even sure exists but might be worth a shot. Needs a mandatory timer.

Other: Bananagrams stole a lot of thunder from this game when it ripped off the speed scrabble formula. I can no longer think of a reason to pick this game up when there's that cute little banana sack running around out there.

Best Use: When you're someplace that doesn't have anything beyond the basic fair, grab the letters and play speed scrabble.

The chicken soup of games

~After more plays than I can count.  Scrabble is one of those games that I shouldn't like as much as I do.  The design itself is kind of clunky- there is a huge, ever-changing, arbitrary list of rules describing what constitutes a valid and an invalid move (which we call a dictionary), after all.  But, after years of playing, it has taken on the warm familiarity of a good friend, whom I can't help but love despite all her flaws.  When I open the box, I feel impossibly comfortable.

Beyond that, Scrabble is treacherously deep: a good player has to know tons of words, develop anagramming skills, learn the intricacies of rack management, and learn how the moves interact geometrically ("open" vs "closed" positions, etc.).  A person could dedicate his life to mastering any one of these skills in isolation- put them all together, and you've got an indescribably complicated beast.  Most people are blissfully unaware of just how insane this game is.  If you want to get a taste of the insanity, read "Word Freak", by Stefan Fatsis, about the world of competitive Scrabble.  

Note: a chess clock is absolutely required.  25 minutes per side is good.  Prevents endless demented anagramming.

I'd play this more but people won't play with me I win too much. Among near equal skill levels, the game is a blast. The game isn't at it's best when people are of different skill in the game. If you read up on the game you find there are 92-94 two letter words. Even refusing to use them, some people have very good anagraming skills and can form bingo's at least once a game. Maybe someday I'll find a way to just barely win with my friends and it'll all be good. :-D (2004) Rating downgraded due to lack of desire to play at all for reasons above. (2012)

This game does not come with a lot of frills, no theme, but it does have lots of little pieces of wood like all of our beloved resource games.  This game is jam packed with thrills.  Nothing is more rewarding than getting all seven letters down for a 50 point bonus, or extending a long word out far enough to reach one of those highly rewarding triple words scores, or stacking words so that you get points for a never ending series of two and three letter words, or getting an X on a triple letter score going in two directions for 48 points alone.  This game rewards you for being able to unscramble exotic words from your jumbled letters and to wow people with your language repertoire.  But you can also do good with dinky little words if you can master the proper placement with all of the bonuses spread across the board.  And all of the mind games involved with challenges add a fun dimension for those with a diabolical streak.  Want to mess with somebody's mind?  Play a highly questionable word after they have just lost two challenges to see if they will risk losing yet another turn.  My only gripe is that the scrabble dictionary seems to have many questionable words and alternate spellings.  A general rule is if you want to put down to random letters the scrabble dictionary will consider it a word.  Of course I am probably just bitter because I can never remember the few rare instances where they don't consider a two letter combination a word.  And talk about memorable moments.  I will never forget the time my wife slammed down a 7 letter word for a 50 point bonus, and on the next word I laid out was the answer, 7 letters and 50 points right back at you.

02/08/2013:  It's Scrabble!  Do I really need to say anything about it?  It's kinda like a multiplayer, competitive crossword.  To be really good at this game, you'll need to memorize lots of 2-letter words and work the board to your advantage to get the best bonus points.  If you are word game person, you probably already own this.  If not, it may or may not work for you depending on who you're playing against.

I friggin' hate Scrabble.  You know there are 5040 different ways to arrange your 7 letters just by themselves?  But you can't take more than 30 seconds on your turn before everyone gets snippy.  And then there's the damn S's.  Ever play against someone who gets all the S's?  And they just put S's on all the big words over and over again?  Or even build words off of those with the S's?  But you never seem to get any S's?  What a crappy game!

Respect the classic.  A masterpiece for two players if you ask me and one of my earliest game memories as my mother is quite fond of it.  I'm just a casual player in terms of 'studying' but I have racked up many 400 point games (two player).  A lot more strategic than it gets credit for.

It was also one of the first games I started hacking.  I remember suggesting to my mother when I was eleven years old that we should be able to amicably trade tiles.  "That's not in the rules," she said (but was interested).  A variant was born.  Little did I know there were books floating around with all kinds of variants like these.  Wish I would have seen them at the time.  It was another year before d&d came along and turned me into a full blown rules expander/inventor/deconstructionist.

These days I can see the flaws - SOOOO much downtime between turns - especially in close games as players calculate their best scoring opportunities. I also HATE the random letter draws, because I end up with a hand full of Q's and R's ans V's.

Still I suppose of all the irritating games I am forced to play with my extended family, this one irritates me the least.

RATING: 8.5
What can be said about Scrabble?  It's a classic.  I have about 4-7 games going through Facebook at all times. The gulf between semi-serious players like myself** (who have memorized the two- and three-letter words and practice rack management and such) and "cottage" players (who just rely on a decent vocabulary) is pretty big, though, and can lead to some severe mismatches (which is kind of unfair to the casual players).

**which is not to say I don't get beaten, because I sure do, but not by casual players -- it's really a different game.

This is an early 80's Selchow and Righter edition.

Although I'd owned the game, I'd played sparingly over the years until I began dating and then eventually married my wife.  She used to play with her family a lot, and she was very good at the game.  I've gotten better at the game over the years, but my wife is still the better player than I.

It's a pleasant 45 minute game to play; we don't play cutthroat or pull out weird words to win (although my wife has been known to pull geology terms out from time to time), so that probably influences my opinion of the game a bit.

I never really understood Scrabble until I was an adult. It's really a tactical game where the choice of possible moves happen to be various letter combinations, rather than a vocabulary game. Think of it that way, and it became the most rewarding of the "classic" games for me.

Jó kis partyjáték. A megadott betűk segítségével szavakat kell kirakni, hogy pontokhoz juthass. Egyetlen, és óriási hibája, hogy nem feltétlenül az nyer, aki a legtöbb szót kirakja. Valamint, a sokáig elhúzódó veszekedések elkerülése végett egy értelmező kéziszótárt és a tábla mellé kéne rögzíteni.

I don't mind Scrabble. It certainly is a game where you use your mind and the better players will almost always beat the lesser players so it certainly isn't high on luck. All that said... it rewards players with good vocabularies and good memories... which is alright if you like those type of games but there just is something about the game that doesn't make it that much fun... you either play ultra competively and go for the throats of your opponents in a very combative game or you just casually place tiles with family members which makes for a more boring game. Neither way really enthralls me in a way that invites me to want to replay the game again and again.

The best way for me to sum the game up is that it's better in theory than in practice... a solid game with nice mechanisms... and certainly variable from game to game... yet not a game I class as very "FUN".

Scrabble is as good as word games get but there are two issues that bothered me when playing. One is that large words (which I am good at coming up with) often don't score higher than ridiculously small ones placed on the right spots.

When you're getting better at this game, it becomes very defensive, trying not to open up an oppotunity for you opponent to e.g. use the tripple word score. And then it comes down to the tiles you draw... Way to long also.

Hey, if Martha Stewart plays, then it's good enough for me, right?  I've played this all my life, and I think the board game world gives it a bad rap.  Although often included in the Candyland, Monopoly, Life group, this one is just not the same.  It's a fun and classic word game.

Everyone knows the game of Scrabble.  Pick up letter tiles and place them on the board to score points.  

I have fun with Scrabble until I have a whole word, or really good letters, and there is nothing I can do with them because there is nowhere to place them.  The frustration that sinks in when I can't figure out the best possible play, or I think my best play is sub-optimal, really starts to leave a bad taste in my mouth.

This is the only game my wife is guaranteed to win every time.  Either I am not smart enough for this game, or, I just don't have the patience.  nah, I am dummer than I thot.

It's so monolithic I can't even look at it with a critical eye. But let's see... with modern OWL the tiles are unbalanced (X especially); the layout of the board favors 4- and 5-letter words; there is a vocabulary of useless words you must acquire; OWL is capricious; luck is a huge deciding factor; etc but I completely love this unbalanced, unfair board game.

I love Scrabble. It's just a very good word game, nothing more, nothing less. More strategy than one would expect. The only bad thing about it is that people often play words that they don't know the definition of or words like "qi," that are known as words that are mostly only used in Scrabble. I prefer it when actual knowledge of vocabulary is a larger contributor to victory, not just how much someone has studied the Scrabble dictionary. Nonetheless, this game is great.

A good game, but one that I find stressful to play.  Good, experienced players can obliterate newbies -- I know that's true of most games, but I find Scrabble to be especially punishing with players of different levels.  Also, I'm not fond of any game where you can "challenge" someone else's play -- in this case, requiring downtime while someone checks (or goes looking for) a dictionary.

I just hate this game. ...No, wait, that's actually not really correct. In fact, I do like its concept, but no matter with whom you play - some always-know-it-better-people will come up with words no one has ever heard of before, or they add stupid, ugly suffixes to words just in order to raise their score... Or you think and think and think and FINALLY, you find a fantastic word! - but unfortunately, it's not your turn yet, and some other player must occupy the spaces you needed. No fun!

A strict timer might help. 

Or play it solo, and it will be allright. But then again, at least I personally just don't play solo board games.

Classic, challenging game.  I have the "Official Scrabble Dictionary" (don't ask me which one) with my board and I always insist on using that as the only source for looking up words.

As a university educated linguist and a pretentious user of superfluous words, I should love scrabble on principle.

I have played this game all my life, although much less in recent years.  It's challenging, but lacks real excitement. I have an old set with wooden tiles and tile racks, which is nice to look at and pleasant to play on.

I love this classis in head-to-head matches against my wife. She wins more than I do, but I still like the game. There is a "luck factor" when it comes to which tiles you draw. But, IMHO, with proper planning, careful watch on what letters may remain in the bag and a "good Scrabble vocabulary", you can just about eliminate the "luck factor". If you do not the "cheesy" 2 letter words that the "Official Scrabble Dictionary" allows, just make a house rule, "No 2 letter words allowed!" You would be surprised how much this can add tension to the play of the game. When we do this rule, we also allow "exchanging the blank".  A must have for any game shelf.

I realize this game is ridiculously popular, but I am really not fond of it and will avoid playing it.  I don't like word games to begin with.  The crossword mechanic further restricts options, and the notion of memorizing a list of obscure two-letter words to facilitate tile placement just bugs me.

RATING: 7
A classic definitive word board game. Mostly tactical due to putting the right word in the right place for scoring. Best to play with people who enjoy word games; otherwise, it probably will turn out to be a waste of time. It is more fun if the game is not taken too seriously, and if players can help others that might be word-visual challenged. 

Boring to some, but not because it doesn't make you think. The classy clean look of scrabble also might be a contributor to why some think this a boring game.

Family game. Beer-N-Pretzels game. Casual game.

Back in the days (mid 80's) when it appeared in Greece our parents went mad about this one. 

I liked it then, i still like it now, eventhough my spelling is embarassing.

Whatever the cons (mostly the debates over which words are alowed), nobody can deny the unique concept and the appeal to non gamers.

(Wife's Point of View: Actually I bought it for her. She hates strategy, likes the aspect that you don't have to plan your moves beforehand like on Hive for example. Really good with 2players. 

It's interesting that my wife doesn't want to burn her mind thinking in games, but she is willing to do it only in this game.)

Definately a classic, but never play it due to incredible down-time. Could use a chess-clock I suppose, but... It is a way at lower levels to estimate one's vocabulary. At higher levels, it measures your ability to memorize the scrabble dictionary words. At that level I give this game a 2: take a mensa test instead.

My wife and I played this a lot before I found BGG, it was my wife's favorite game growing up and we both still enjoy and are quite competitive with each other.  My most epic board game victory came in this game, my very last tile was a Z, I was down by 20 points, so on a whim I placed the Z on a double letter square to spell ZA.  My wife challenged, and sure enough ZA is a word...  I had come back to win by 1 with the very last tile.  There was much hooting and hollering!  This is why I play board games.

Classic word game.  My wife and I usually pull this one out because she loves it way more than I. We also ensure we have an unabridged dictionary around as well for challenges (I lost on jihad once which was not in a standard dictionary, never again).  If you play with kids, use it as a means to have them learn new words.  

Also available in foreign language editions - I also have the Russian/Cyrillic and French versions. My versions are quite old.

We just love Scrabble and have played it so many times over the years!  My copy is over 20 yrs. old and I brought it with me from the US.  It is well worn and well loved.

Our gaming strategy has changed over the years from trying to make "cool words" on the board, to really working those small words that you can fit into tight spaces for the points!

This is always a favorite for myself and my husband.  It's a classic and if you like word games, Scrabble is the game for you.

This is not a game you play to learn about words, this is a game of memorizing word patterns. Unless you love anagrams you will not like this games. Watch a couple of Scrabble documentaries (see: [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1386254/tabletop-documentaries]Tabletop Documentaries[/url]) to understand why you have no hope of ever being good at this game unless you wish to give up every normal aspect of your life.

When I was young, I disliked scrabble because it was too slow to play, and difficult to think of anything to play.

When I was older, I loved scrabble, for I was now old enough to be better at it, and the game flowed a lot better.

Now, older still, I dislike scrabble again, because I've got to a state where the only way to get any better is to learn a load of extra words.  Learning vocabulary lists is not something I consider fun.  Sounds too much like school homework.  The fact that improving further requires this time, and that not improving further is frustrating, means I have far less wish to play scrabble than I used to.

At my level, I also find that (especially if you allow lots of short words like QI or JO or ZO) that the winner between two close opponents is almost always the one who gets the most of the letters Q, Z, X, J, H, S, Blank.  Especially the X.

One of the best word games ever! I personally like having the recent "limited 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition" with its rotating board and digital timer (which keeps the pace moving). Also included is the Official Scrabble Word List (an abbreviated form of the Official Scrabble Dictionary) which, while illegal reference during games (except for challenges), is very good homework for brushing up word skills. The only words on the list are those which are legal and can be formed with the Scrabble tiles included. First strategy: memorize every "Q" word which doesn't utilize a "U" as second letter.

However, of the classic board games, Scabble is one of the best.

I don't play as much Scrabble now as I used to, but I still enjoy a game given the chance.  I own this folio editon which means you can store the game by locking in your tiles for future play.

Even when I played more often I wasn't a true Scrabble fanatic, although I will admit I was pretty darn good.

RATING: 10
This really is an exceptional game.  I liked to play it as a kid, but of course there were only 8 games in the world way back then.  But even now, it's still a great game.  I could play it a half-dozen times every week and not tire of it.  I've also found that (shhh...don't tell anyone or I'll lose all my old Scrabble cred) it plays better if you're allowed to look up words in the dictionary BEFORE you make a play, as long as you still move along smartly.

How can anyone not like Scrabble? I take that back... I hate playing scrabble when I'm playing against someone who can only play two and three letter words. It also sucks when I play against someone who can super kick my ass, but at least there is a challenge!

RATING: N/A
I'm a writer, a word guy, an inveterate reader, and I detest Scrabble. Detest it. It privileges memorization skills rather than word use, and is consequently more of a spelling game where you know [i]about[/i] words. Also, the end game is interminable because everyone looks for those two-letter words that you have to memorize and then never use in practice. I will only play it as a favor to someone else, and I will do my best to not sulk about it, but it's a shitty game. I much prefer word games that involve some kind of word use creativity where you can play with morphology. A game called "Sniglets" remains my favorite word game ever, and no one ever agrees with me on it. Balderdash is a distant second. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My favorite of the widely accepted games.  I'm not sure how many sets of this game I've gone through.  Currently have a glass topped board on a turntable sitting on my shelf.  I miss the little wooden tiles, although the version with a built in turntable and recessed spaces to hold the tiles in place was my favorite to actually use.

Best moment that I'm ashamed of: Playing a game with Mom and I spelled "vagina" for a triple word score.

I don't particularly like word games, but this is the best of those. The Finnish edition is a bit challenging occasionally due to so few Finnish words with B, C, D and F (and only one tile for each of those, of course).

RATING: 5.5
The game my (then new) wife stomped me playing. Everything I tried - the draw-luck just failed me. It doesn't help that she has a better vocabulary. More recent plays are only slightly improved losses - I'm not competitive with words.

What to say about Scrabble ? I enjoy playing it with people that enjoy words and reading, unfortunately, those are rare. 

EDIT: Played it again and I do not understand why people are so wary when it comes to playing Scrabble. I think they are afraid that people think they are stupid if they lose etc. I do not really mind, I am not English anyway so I have a natural disadvantage here. I still like it, I like the pace and playing with words.

April 18 2011 UPDATE: Probably the most strategic word game out there. Once you've figured out that you should get at least one seven tile play (bingo) during [b]every[/b] game, this becomes a tense game of resource management.

Still, there's way too much AP for face-to-face play. Yes, the opportunity to play long words is there, but you really have to earn it.

There's something very gratifying and fulfilling at the end of every Scrabble game; you end up with an array of interlocking words. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the game itself (you cannot ever form incomplete words), it's impossible to create dense crossword arrays.

=====

October 2007 UPDATE: For solo play and against computer opponents, this rates a 10. For face-to-face play, it drops to 4!

I hate this game. My dad does crossword puzzles every waking hour, so I always get pummeled when I play against him. However, I did spend the time programming a Java-based engine for this game, and the new portfolio travel edition, with tiles that snap into the grid, is sweet.

the current rating for this game on the geek is 6.5. please, you guys are crazy. this is a great game. complaints that this game boils down to whoever memorizes the most obscure 2 or 3 letter words aren't completely accurate in my opinion. although, sometimes a well timed and placed three letter word can win the game. anyway, i've been slaughtered by people who use the most pedestrian vocabulary to great effect. luck plays a role, sure. but like most well designed games which have a small element of luck, scrabble is usually won by the player who most efficiently uses her resources.

If there's one category of games where German games cannot compete, it is word games.  Because german games tend to be language independent, there's a dearth of modern development in these types.  Scrabble is the chess of word games.  There's a good strategic component when considerating positions of words on the board and management of vowels/special letters.  There's a good tactical component when unscrambling letters.  My big qualm is that this is a game with MAJOR downtime--anyone can analyze over and over again their set of tiles and never feel they've found the best move.  And yet the fun is trying to analyze over and over again, knowing that you haven't found the best move, so go figure.

The game I play more than any other.  My scrabble partner Priscilla and I play weekly when I am in town.  (I am currently living in India) I think with scrabble some house rules are the way to go - but even with the official rules its a great game.

Players need to be equally matched to make this game enjoyable.  But game still drags with the luck of the draw.  Would rather spend my time playing a different game or a less restrictive word game (Typo).

Reading the book Word Freak cemented the reasons why I dislike Scrabble.  Like Chess, the game must be studied and lines (word lists) memorized.  I just prefer to spend my time playing more games instead of mastering a few.

There are some who get it; I won't:

My wife used to like it.  Actually, she still plays it with her friends on occasion even though she has become disenchanted with it as well.  When I DID play Scrabble, I only played it to spend time with my wife... it was a true act of love since I find this game is incredibly boring.  Whoever knows the most 2 and 3 letter words will normally win.

Decent game, you must have this in your house, ideal for competitions, ever expanding word dictionary. However, it suffers from boredom from waiting for players to make a move, and a runaway leader problem that can oftentimes result from a senior player making a Bingo. You -can- catch up, mind you, but all hope will seem lost if you are not as verse in the OSPD as your opponent.

    I get crushed at Scrabble.  Often.  It deserves to be punished with a low rating.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I think Scrabble is one of those games that either captivates you or leaves you unmoved.  I like playing, but I'll pass over it to try something new.  This may be due to me struggling with the vocab, though I suppose that's as valid as any other reason for a rating.

Meillä tätä pelataan ilman lautaa ja kahdella eri tavalla. Toinen tapa, jota usein nimitetään pitkäksi peliksi, on kasata kaikki kirjaimet nurinpäin keskelle pöytää. Pelaajat kääntävät vuorotellen kirjaimen kerrallaan näkyviin. Aina, kun kirjaimista muodostuu suomenkielinen sana, voi kuka tahansa pelaajista huutaa sen itselleen. Emme tavallisesti ole hyväksyneet slangisanoja tai murreilmauksia emmekä myöskään muita kuin yksinkön nominatiiveja, mutta jos sana on erityisen pitkä tai hyödyntää hankalia kirjaimia voidaan se silti hyväksyä. Sanan ensin huutanut pelaaja asettaa kirjainlaatat eteensä sanaksi siten, että muut voivat sanan lukea. Toisen pelaajan sanan voi varastaa lisäämällä sanaan vähintään yhden kirjaimen pöydän kasasta. Sekä sanan ydinmerkiktyksen että muodon on muututtava. Sanasta puu ei siis voi tehdä sanaa puun eikä edes sanaa puuro, mutta pulu kyllä käy. Tavallisesti tosin pelaamme vähintään nelikirjaimisilla sanoilla. Kun kaikki laatat on käännetty voittaa eniten sanoja saanut. Näin perusscrabblen uuvuttavasta pistelaskusta päästään.

Toinen tapa, jota usein kutsutaan pikapeliksi tai ristikoksi, on niinikään kasata laatat keskelle pöytää, jolta jokainen ottaa aluksi itselleen seitsemän laattaa. Kun omat laatat saa kaikki muodostettua sanaristikoksi voi huutaa "ota kaks!", jolloin kaikkien pelaajien on otettava kaksi laattaa keskeltä ja lisättävä ne ristikkoihinsa. Jos kukaan ei onnistu eheän ristikon muodostamisessa, otetaan uudet kaksi laattaa yhteistuumin. Tässä pelissä olemme tavallisesti hyväksyneet kaikenpituiset ja -muotoiset sanat huudahduksista slangiin. Emme ole perinteisesti laskeneet pisteitä vaan vain jumpanneet aivoja.

It's hard to pin a rating onto this one. On one hand, I love words and word games. On the other hand, there are boardgames that have more interesting designs and greater intrinsic excitement. But a big part of how I perceive a game comes from the memories that I have of playing it with people, and for years this game has been a family ritual - always ending in hilarity as we bend more and more rules and turn the game into a cooperative mission to fill up the board with words.

It's a classic, of course.  However, don't buy the new "Game Folio" Travel Edition.  The "snap-in" tiles don't stay in place very well, and often snapping one into place will result in tiles next to it flying off the board.  The tiles are also difficult to remove from the board when finished playing.  A 9 for the game itself, but a 2 for this edition.

2nd favorite Abstract! This is a cheat, I know. With all of that randomness AND hidden information, this is clearly not an abstract. I don't care, I'm categorizing it here anyway. I suppose because I have similar feelings about it, study it and play it in a similar way to, other abstracts like Chess & Go.

I'm not a kitchen table scrabble player. My mother taught me early, and by the time I was 12 she couldn't beat me anymore, to her frustration and embarrassment (/pride), so we stopped playing. I do study word lists, have memorized the 2 letter words, made strong inroads into the 3 letters, and q & J words. I'm not too serious, though, otherwise I'd have the 3's, 4's, and 500 most common bingoes down. I'll admit, I coast on my innate ability to see pattern combinations on board. If I ever got competitive again, I'd have to step my game up a notch.

In law school my friend James was the North American champion, it was fun being next to his world of competition, getting a glimpse. I may prefer scrabble pros to both Chess and Go pros--they're more interesting. Read Word Freak by Stephen Fatsis for a taste, it's a fun book.

I didn't play seriously at all until I tried to get back together with my father, who left us when I was very young...I hadn't seen him for 18 years by the time I tracked him down in my 20's. It was hard to talk to him through my anger and feelings of abandonment--he was a useless communicator, the only way we could spend time around each other was through scrabble. Delightfully, he was better than me, so I was able to ramp up and attack using my (formidable) full capacity for gaming, studying, memorizing, playing against far better players on isc.ro, etc.

It was only after many games of scrabble (hundreds) and many years that we were able to begin to actually talk. We're still far apart, and may always be (manic depression's a bitch, hard to take into account in a person), but I'm grateful for what I do have with him. He can't beat me anymore, but it doesn't matter now. Thanks, Scrabble.

The better you get at Scrabble, the less fun it becomes -- the board makes it a blocking / denial game, and the scrabble dictionary makes it a set collecting game more than a word game. And new players never seem to believe that letters can be placed on the end of an existing word to score the original word plus a new orthogonal word. And the downtime is huge.

Update: bumped it up to a 6 after playing a close game with my Scrabble nemesis, Louise. If you play with people not afflicted by AP or poor vocab, it's much more fun.

Update the second: played some more, bumped it up again. Online play at itsyourturn.com (under the name Jamble) solves the AP and downtime problems nicely.

Love Scrabble, hate the official dictionary. The printed rules require a 'standard' dictionary, which is an entirely different thing : you won't find qi or za in one.

Must be played with a dictionary that includes a good range of swears.

It's a classic family game - what more can you say... How about playing it under water! Yep, if you're sick of analysis paralysis and players try to get 41 points on their turn instead of the 40 they can see right there, then speed up the whole process. Wrap the board in waterproof plastic and weigh it down at the bottom of the pool. Players on their turn must enter the water and in one breath place their word or forfeit their turn. The more players the better. (More recovery time.)

Very analytical game in which you form words with letter tiles in order to score.  There's always disccusions about the existence of words, so pick a dictionary to be the "official" one and keep it close.  Besides, put some time rules, because if you don't it could take forever.

My development as a scrabble player:

2) Okay, well I'm still better at scoring words than other people.  Yay.

3) Well, now I'm better at drawing challenges with obscure words that are really close to fairly common words.  Yay.

4) Once they stopped challenging words, I can now freely spell fake words that look like obscure words.  Yay.

5) Once they realized that I was making up words sometimes, I can now spell really obscure words and draw more challenges.  Yay.

6) Memorizing the dictionary is not a frigging game.  What the fuck.  

7) Saved from committing suicide by Bananagrams.

I learned Scrabble from a great-aunt who could have played professionally. She taught me how to look for word forming chances across already laid tiles- a must. I hosted many Scrabble games in the early 00's, for the Winnebago Street Scrabble Club, here in Madison, WI. Good times. I own the deluxe plastic lazy susan set.

"Ugly" play (e.g. one-letter stubs to which one can't append, or words that end just short of the edge, so that the opponent can't reach the 3xW fields) too often thwarts my "nice" plans, so that thinking during my opponent's turn is often wasted. Therefore, I prefer to play it with a clock.

I'm pretty abysmally bad at this, compared to the folks I usually play against, but I enjoy it anyway.  My only real complaint mechanic-wise is when you draw a Q or something on your very last turn.  A "good" Scrabble player, of course, would know all the little tricky two-and-three-letter words for those letters which could be easily found on a mostly-filled-in board, but someone like myself who only plays occasionally and Doesn't Care is generally just doomed to lose quite a few points when the final scoring comes through.

Swedish language edition. Scrabble is a great game to bring along when traveling, but lately I find that I'd rather just bring a full-size Scrabble board than this.

RATING: 10
Play this in Swedish. I go for it half-seriously too, and I've done my fair share of dictionary studying.

Straight out of the box with more than two players I'd rank this a 4 or 5 - it takes forever, breeds frustration, doesn't define clearly which words are legal or not, and rewards the player to the left of the newbie.

Played with tournament rules, non-AP prone players (or a chess timer), and a maximum of two players, this is a solid 10. Rewards creativity and is actually incredibly deep, despite being heavily luck-dependent. Also, I cannot imagine a more satisfying gaming experience than scoring your first bingo.

High-level swedish scrabble is a whole different beast from high-level english scrabble. The main difference is that the dictionary used in swedish tournament rules is so much sparser than the english ones - meaning there are less hooks, less bingoes, less ways to get rid of your z, basically less of everything :) So swedish scrabble rewards defensive play to a greater extent since it's easier to lock up the board and block things. Some may find this a nuisance, but to me, it makes the game feel so much more strategic.

If you're interested in learning more about Swedish tournament Scrabble, go to www.scrabbleforbundet.se and read up - or go to www.betapet.se and play some games. You'll be hooked in no time!

Of course, a classic. Can be convinced to play it, and will enjoy it - but with some of the other games I've been discovering, this one has taken a bit of a back burner position. I may play it on my Android every once in a while, if I'm bored and waiting around.

In theory, I really like this game.  However, at best, I am a casual player of the game.  Unfortunately, the couple my wife and I have been generally been able to play with for the past several years ar Scrabble nuts.  They have memorized every 2 and 3 letter word known to man, every word that contains a Q not followed by U, and more Z words than you use in a year.  They also take forever to play (well, so do I).  It's like playing chess with a grandmaster -- just go ahead and declare them the winner.  Then find something else to do.  Note here, it's not people with big vocubularies that are a turn-off here, it's that some people (too many of the people who want to play) take the game way too seriously for it to be a fun experience.

Probably 150+ plays. In person, I would likely rather play Boggle or share doing a crossword puzzle with someone. But Scrabble is ok.

Update: Feb 2013. I raise my overall rating to an 8. Every now and then, when played against a well matched opponent(s), Scrabble can be quite fun. The iPad app makes it even more so. 

However, Scrabble is still a beastly brutal game to play under many circumstances, because it breaks down badly if players are not equally matched in their knowledge of obscure words - words not useful for ANYTHING else in life but Scrabble or crossword puzzles.

A classic word building game that most non-gamers will be familiar with, and offer little resistance to play.

One of the best traditional board games. Elegantly designed, with nice wooden pieces and lots of opportunities for tactical play on the bonus squares.

Compare this to chess, which becomes ever more beautiful at high levels of play.

Korábban is játszottam már talán 1-2 partit vele. 7 véletlenszerűen húzott betűnkből próbálunk szavakat alkotni a táblán már fent levőkhöz. Minden betű meghatározott pontot ér, attól függően egyre többet, hogy mennyire sokszor fordul elő nyelvben.   A táblán különböző bónusz mezők vannak, amiken az adott betű vagy szó a többszörösét érheti. Emiatt akár egy kétbetűs szóval is sokszor annyi pontot lehet elnyerni, mint egy hosszúval. A játék az összes betű elfogyásáig tart. Kicsit talán hosszú, de bárkivel játszható játék.

When I was young, I used to play Scrabble with my grandfather, who does the crosswords every day.  Then my wife goaded me into getting a copy of Scrabble for us.  This, coupled with reading Stefan Fatsis's book "WordFreak", I decided to give in.  While I like Scrabble o.k. as a game, perhaps I'm not as good at anagramming as I like to think, because it always seems that I'm staring at my rack of tiles and that I cannot find one worthwhile word to make from the lot.  The semi-irony is that, although my wife loves word games, she's only fair when it comes to spelling, so sometimes the game plays out in fits and starts.  Given my druthers of word games, I'd rather play Boggle.

Don&#039;t even think about playing without the official wordlist or dictionary: although infuriatingly inconsistent, it&#039;s the only way to resolve disagreements about allowable words. As for the suggestion that two-letter words be disallowed, that would make for a completely different game. A knowledge of the allowable two-letter words, not a huge vocabulary, is the key to success in standard play. If you&#039;re not consistently scoring 15-30 points per turn, you&#039;re not playing this game right.

Amazing quality in the diamond edition the letters feel like wood but are plastic. Classy black color with silver lettering contrasts well with the self contained board/box. slide out trays for brackets and felt letter bag make managing the pieces easy.

This game for awhile was played at my job all the time. Now it doesn't get much play as it has been in storage for a long time until recently when I pulled out all my games. Its a travel version of Scrabble. The game fits into what looks like a cd carry case and comes with plastic tile holders that have a cover that can be folded open or shut to protect your letters from going all over the place and the tile holders fit nicely under the board. The tiles them selves are like 3D tiles and sorta snap into place on the board so they dont fall off. This is one of the best Scrabble versions I have seen. I even have the Official Scrabble Dictionary.

I rated Scrabble a 4, despite the fact that I really do think it's a good game with many scoring opportunities, simple rules and a great name, but I'm simply not usually willing to play it.  Granted, my playing partner is usually my wife, and we are so perfectly, evenly matched at this game that it's like playing myself.  Thus our games are usually defensive wait-fests that drag on interminably, with neither side willing to give up a 2x or 3x word score, or even a useful hanging letter, if we can help it.  Conversation slows to a terse (and sarcastic) "Thanks for that", and the grudging and not well-received "Nice word."  Needless to say, we've stopped wasting our time with this, and moved on to more harmonious pursuits.

I'm usually only good for about half a game of Scrabble.  You really need to play with people with about the same vocabulary as you to have any fun.  Otherwise you are blowing away or getting blown away by your opponent which is no fun.  You don't want to feel like you've won or lost the game after the first few rounds and just going through the motions for the rest of the game.

If I'm playing a classic word game I'm playing Boggle.

In theory, I like Scrabble. I mean, I'm an English teacher and writer. I love words. However, I'm just terrible at Scrabble - probably because I'm the opposite of competitive and get enough strategizing away from the game table. My husband plays Scrabble on the iPad almost every day. Me, I played our wood-box version once, took a photo of all the dirty words I made, then never played again. There's nothing wrong with the game; it's just me.

The Polish version is probably a good one. We tend to have more versions of one single word (due to various changes the words undergo when conjugated, when the tense or person changes) which makes it easier to score high. One of the best games I've played.

RATING: 4
"SCRABBLE®" (ah, the beloved trademark symbol) isn't a game, it's a lifestyle.  The people who spend evenings memorizing the 70 words where "Q" isn't followed by "U" so they can stuff "tzaddiqim" down your throat will ALWAYS crush anybody who doesn't.  I don't, ergo.  I still play with my wife and select friends, but the rules are largely squelched, making the game more of a running conversation and joke-fest.  For me, it's a vast improvement.  Because if there's a hanging "k" on the board and you have a chance to play "[MR.] MXYZTPLK" in fond remembrance of Superman #30, the only thing that stops you should be your opponent objecting that, in the SuperFriends animated series, the "T" and "P" in his name were reversed.  As spelling disagreements in "SCRABBLE®" go, it would at least have character.

Other games come and go, but this one regularly gets played - and we have fun with it. Super-scrabble is fantastic for a larger group of people, massive board, twice as many tiles and quadruple word scores! - we played a game with EIGHT people over the course of a day whilst on hols - really casual, folk were doing other stuff and then wandered over when it was their turn. Worked exceptionally well!

I recently rediscovered the fun in this classic. Depending on your group, word knowledge and one's ability to anagram aren't going to kill you. I can't anagram for sh!t. But I can evaluate the board and pick places to play that give me lots of points. It is ok to play mostly 3-4 letter words with the occasional 5. I even scored 18 points from just playing an X and getting OX and AX.

All that, combined with a game that everyone is fairly comfortable with and likes to talk over, leaves me with a social game I'm happy to play most anytime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, but the downtime can be maddening.
I once had the exhilarating experience of playing this with 30 second timed turns.  It was intense, but it required 2 extra people: 1 to score the words and 1 to manage the clock.

It's a great idea in concept: being able to kill an hour or two on an airplane or lengthy road trip playing a portable game of "Scrabble".  But, like I explained in my "Scrabble "review, the edition I have was rather poorly made and the letters have a habit of literally popping off the board and flying every which direction.  Frustrating!  Game design: 2/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 3.5/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's an old classic, it's very cleverly designed, it gets the brain juices flowing (I think that's the medical term), but talk about down-time between turns!  And I'll admit it, I am just as guilty (okay, probably more so) as everyone else when it comes to taking forever on my turn.  If only everyone else could have one minute for their turns and I could have ten minutes for mine, then it would be a great game (no wait, I WANT everyone else to take a long time so that I can spend more time figuring out what my next word will be and I won't be so pressured when my turn comes).  Playing the "Speed Scrabble" variant takes away this whole problem, but it also takes away everything else that makes "Scrabble" a good game, so it doesn't really do much for me.  And if I may be allowed to complain about one more thing (I was just asking to be polite - I'm going to complain anyways), the pieces for my "Scrabble: Travel Edition" won't stay in the board - they keep popping out and falling under the airplane seats.  Curses!  One other important note: a good dictionary is a must!  (Mental note, buy a good dictionary.)  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 7/10

Used to love this before we discovered modern board games. It just about works as 2 player but make sure the players are evenly matched. If one player has swallowed a dictionary or knows a lot of 2 letter words then it'll be a long evening for the other player. Anymore than 2 players is too chaotic - there's too much downtime and no point planning ahead anyway because your space will probably be taken.

update: got back in to this after playing with friends. And that's the clincher - while most people's reaction to you pulling Settlers of Catan or Arkham Horror out is "huh?", everyone knows how to play Scrabble. I generally don't like games that rely on exterior knowledge, but there is also something virtuous about playing Scrabble, like I am expanding my vocabulary. Some games still suck and the tile draw can be a killer, but generally willing to play now.

An absolute classic. Beautifully simple. Have played it many times and have always felt like I've got something out of the game afterwards. Obviously your ability to succeed at this game is determined by the size of your vocabulary (although being able to memorise all those obscure two and three letter words that have never actually been used by anyone in conversation ever almost guarantees you'll do well). Didn't realize until visiting the BGG page for this game that it was designed by a chap called Alfred Mosher Butts, which is apt, because guaranteed at least once both parts of his surname will have been placed on the board during a game of Scrabble. Great name, great game.

RATING: 7.5
A game I can play with my mum, which is always a good thing. Also in recent years I have started to get a bit more strategic with my rack management, and tend to think a couple of moves ahead, so that makes it a bit more fun. As long as you are willing to play in the manner that your opponents want to play (ie a defensive/strategic game vs a game with lots of nice words), then it's generally fun. The downtime can be a bummer of course, but as with most games like this, can be easily solved with a timer. I also like to play tournament style, where the dictionary is consulted only if the other player 'challenges'. If it's not a word you lose your turn, but if it is a word, the challenger loses their turn.

I personally think scrabble is a great game.  Especially two player.  However, if someone comes to the table 'trained' in the wiles of scrabble it can definitely unbalance the game.  However, if both people are 'trained' or untrained.  I think it has excellent tactical word play coupled with lexicographic stimulation.

My wife and I purchased our square "Travel Scrabble" set from Toys R Us for AUD$10 back in 1994, and since then it's seen countless plays in bus tours, airplane trips, train-rides, and even while sunning beside the pool or on the beach. I've kept a small leatherbound notebook inside the set (okay, I stole the notebook from a 5-star hotel room, but it was the same green colour and fit PERFECTLY inside the zip-cover!) in which we chronicle all our plays (i.e. date, place, scores). Needless to say, this set is our most treasured boardgame of the lot.

I've never seen a close game of Scrabble, only total blowouts. The randomness of tile acquisition can be extremely detrimental and can result in terribly lopsided games. It feels bad enough to be stuck with seven vowels, but it feels worse to waste a turn redrawing letters.

Waiting for other players can really be a drag if you aren't strict about time limits, and enforcing time limits can make people get upset if they have picked a bad combination of tiles to work with, but aside from that it's a consistently great game that has less to do with having a large vocabulary and more to do with mathematical optimization.

Word games have never been favorites of mine, and Scrabble is a word game.  And so it follows that Scrabble is not a favorite of mine.  It's probably just that I am terrible at it, but it always feels like I have crappy letters, or that no matter what I do I am setting someone up for a triple word score.  It just feels a little too much like taking the SATs for me to fully enjoy.  I do respect its status as a classic game, and I will always have it in my collection.

There are some good things about Scrabble, but many bad things. Random/luck based in regards to the letters you draw, which can be very limiting. This limitation can be a good thing, by forcing the player to really think and find the most optimal play from a limited selection, but it can also hose the player based on pure bad luck. And it is somewhat broken, as players can simply play small obscure words in the right spot to score big points, particularly if they just happen to get lucky and draw a Z or Q.

#71 Turntable Scrabble Crossword Game:
Deluxe revolving board
Plastic tiles
Scoring racks

Selchow & Righter Co.
505 East Union St.
Bay Shore, L.I., N.Y.

An elegantly-designed old set with rather mild use-related wear, probably vintage mid-1950s.
The "turntable" board was over 1/4" thick, with a raised grid, its edges and bottom wrapped with a tough black covering.
There was a subtle lump at the center bottom allowing it to spin freely with no bearings or mechanism.
The cribbage-like scoring racks with aluminum pegs were a wonderful innovation.
Why don't they make those any more?  The gold standard in Scrabble.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This attempt to recreate the glory of the #71 comes close, yet still falls short.
Though the board has a raised grid, the design is on paper glued to the top of a piece of 1/4" masonite.
The "turntable" is a thick piece of felt glued to the bottom.
Needless to say, there are no scoring racks.
Interestingly, however, a rulebook *in Braille* is provided(!)
The box is an attractive powder blue with gilt lettering, in excellent condition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In this vintage 1980s travel set, the letters adhere to the plastic board like Colorforms.
Four little black palettes are provided to serve as "racks."
The whole thing is roughly the size of a checkbook when folded up.
It fits into a thin plastic envelope-like cover with a metal snap.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Travel set dating from somewhere between the mid-1980s and early 1990s.
High-impact blue plastic latchable case is hinged with original blue cloth-backed tape (essentially duct tape).
Board inside has raised grid, and a side compartment for storing letter tiles.
Another side compartment stores four clear plastic tile racks.
Has a blue cloth drawstring bag for holding the tiles during play.
A precursor to the Game Folio Edition.

It's a decent way to pass the time, but I really need to get a timer or something so it doesn't drag on.  Nothing in gaming feels longer than waiting for an opponent to finally lay down a three-letter word.

I never win because I play with a freakin&#039; word prodigy, but I enjoy trying to fill in all the little gaps at the end of the game with high-scoring two-letter words. I also get a kick out of the made-up words people SWEAR are in the dictionary.

Scrabble is on of my 'Only 5' games (one of the 5 games I would pick if I could only play 5 games for the rest of my life, this assumes optimal playmates are always available).
Scrabble has enough depth to enslave people for the rest of their lives in attempt at mastery. It also has enough luck to keep people parched for another sip of lady luck's offerings. 
As all Scrabble players know, it is a game of numbers, not just words. That's why even a terrible speller like myself can be sucked into word lists. 
No, Scrabble is rarely exciting. It only occasionally induces laughter. But it does result in post game chatter and mid-game torment. 
Give me a game of Scrabble and I'll not want.

One of my favorite mass-market games, honestly.  Besides being kind of a language nerd, I admire Scrabble because at heart it isn't a word game.  It's an area-control game, and a really mean one at that.  Play my grandmother sometime and see if she ever, ever sets you up for a triple word score.  Spoiler alert: she won't.

Edit: She is now deceased, but her legacy lives on.  Memorizing obscure words can be helpful in advanced play, but even your casual kitchen-table game of Scrabble will be much improved if you think a little more about what the word you just played allows your opponents to do in response.

"I'm spelling 'tone'."

I like this game because I am good at it, but I acknowledge it is a bad game. It doesn't reward any interesting word-related skill but rather 2 and 3 letter word memorization (and not even in an interesting chess-like motif kind of way, it's just rote memorization). I'll play it with family and establish my dominance though.

Incredibly irritating, restricted by your vocabularly and how well you've memorised the two and three letter words. Turns often take ages trying to find the best possible play. Horrible. Give me enough time between plays and I'll probably be convinced to play it, only to remember how bad it is. This may go down in my estimations.

I hear that I'm supposed to hate Scrabble if I'm going to be a member of the cool kid crowd (well, the board game geek's equivalent of the cool kid crowd). But, I have a lot of good memories with it.

Playing Scrabble with an opponent who is not inclined towards vocabulary is tantamount to challenging a friend to a bicycle race and bringing a car.

So,  this is an enjoyable word game with the proviso that players are of fairly equal ability.

Classic word game!  I play Words With Friends on the iPhone, but it's essentially the same.  I like Scrabble's rules better because you can challenge words that are obviously not real, or neither player even knows.  I have a couple versions of Scrabble for nostalgia purposes, but never play them.  I don't feel like a board game collection can be complete without it!

Scrabble deserves respect for what it is. There can be no argument that this game is challenging and has some depth. Still, I find myself avoiding playing this game. I consider the retention of words for no other purpose than the retention of words an exercise in trivia and useless for general application. I am a lit major, a lover of reading and writing, yet this sort of game doesn't appeal to me at all. My wife, on the other hand, loves it.

Had to rate this according to the index because I play Palabra instead of Scrabble whenever I want a Scrabble expereience.

The first game that I remember really enjoying was SCRABBLE. The game is prominent in my family as I have two great aunts who played against each other every chance they got. Though they were not championship level, they rarely had a game between them go below 800 points. I can still remember the time as I child when I watched one of my great aunts (who happens to be a Franciscan nun) play the F-word on a triple word score. Seeing the aghast look on my face, she calmly said. "its in the dictionary."

The game has much to recommend it: hand management, tactical placement, and a unique anagram mechanic.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A more accessable game than chess, less dependent on having evenly matched players, but still not for everyone. The strategy is fairly hard to master, as are the skills of anagramming and identifying scoring opportunities. 

This game has several great elements. The board is excellently designed, there are several types of decision seamlessly interwoven, and it has a genuine skill at the heart of it (anagramming). On the down side is the need (if you play competitively) to learn arcane words, and the language dependency - it is a different game in different languages.

I'm a Scrabble player. 

There really isn't much more to say, is there? If I had the time and energy, I'd study word lists and start going to tournaments. As it is, I'm about as good as a player can get before they start getting truly serious.

There is the pool player who can beat everyone at the local bar, but no one in the pool hall. Likewise, I can beat anyone in the living room, but no one in the Scrabble halls. But still, I am a Scrabble player. And given an opponent of roughly equal caliber, there are few things I enjoy more. I still keep a version of Classic on my Mac just so I can continue to play the original version of Maven (before Sheppard sold it to Hasbro, who then proceeded to butcher it).

Less pure sense-pleasure than the larger wooden tiles of the regular version, but very practical (which is not the case of all travel games).

Will note in fairness that my Dad, cursed with sausage-fingers, has trouble snapping in the components without them flying around.

English spelling is a randomized hodge-podge, with no REAL rules that apply.  Any rule is ignored more often than enforced, and spelling skill is proof only of rote memorization skill, not intellect.

I love word games, and Scrabble is a classic favorite. Because of Scrabble I know how to spell too many small words and am lagging in knowledge of their definitions.

RATING: 5
In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.

Like many people, I grew up playing Scrabble.  Between this game and Boggle, not sure which I've played more in my life.  At one time I would have rated this a 10.  But the game is ruined by more awareness of how to win it.  Essentially, it comes down to memorizing word lists which then means no one who plays casually will ever want to play you again.  And the other serious players who have studied those same lists?  Not usually the kind of people you want to hang out with and drink a beer.  So the game goes from a family bonding experience to one of work (more work than any other game! - what other game do you have to STUDY to win?) and disconnection from your opponents.  Voila, a game ruined.

Although the player with a bigger vocabulary has a distinct advantage, it is essential to use clever tile placement to maximize your score. The two-letter word list really helps. A timeless classic, and one of the few games I never get tired of. I only play with 2 players.

Most of my plays are online at the Internet Scrabble Club. My username there is Trenton.

Classic letter tile word construction game. An official scrabble dictionary is useful to resolve eligible word disputes. My biggest gripe about Scrabble is that seating position can greatly affect the outcome when differing skill level players are at the table As such, it's best played as a 2P game. Analysis Paralysis can also be significant further supporting the 2P notion.

Scrabble is always half really enjoyable fun, and half excruciating pain for me.  I love the little bit of defensive playstyle you can use to block opponents, and judge which word to play to force your opponents hand.  But there are just way too many times where you get bad draws, stuck with all vowels, and one passing turn could really put you at a deficit.  Too luck based I guess?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another hoary classic, but, though it does require some spatial imagination and forethought, and can be dastardly in the distribution of letters to the player's racks, generally results in the same (word-mongering) person winning time and again, at least amongst casual non-scrabble-dictionary-memorizing players.

This one is WAY too long.  It's also one of those games that seems to be as much about intellectual chest thumping as it is the game.  Often very frustrating, and that can lead to the (mistaken) conclusion that the person with the best vocabulary won.  The others, then, are left to feel like dirt.  Sour grapes?  Maybe, but I usually win this game among casual competition.

The ultimate in word gaming. Most of my plays are from a local club. I don't play online at all.
**update 6/24/08** I am retiring this game from my top 10 list. If there was a LEGENDARY list it would be placed there.
The game is a classic and as far as word/boardgames go it will never be replaced.
For all the naysayers - Don't play with more than two players! Get a decent dictionary (OWL2) and a chess timer if your games run long. Each side should have no more than 25 minutes each. Even I don't want to play a game of Scrabble that takes an hour! Study the 2-letter word list. At 101 words it isn't that many words and you probably even know a few already! lol!

The game has proven to be more fun and challenging than I expected, but it's not without issues.  If both players are experienced enough with the game to fight over positions near the bonus tiles, and know how to block their opponents with strategic word placement, and both players have a good vocabulary, then the game comes down to the luck of the draw, which can be very frustrating.  And if one player ISN'T experienced at the game, then he's just going to get beat down by the players who are.

A los padres de los juegos de mesa actuales –aunque en el “Scrabble”, casi habría que decir abuelo-  les debemos un profundo respeto por todas las puertas que abrieron y por ser las monturas donde se asientan las ideas posteriores. Por tanto el despreciarlos es algo erróneo, y alejado de los verdaderos amantes de los juegos de mesa. 

Dicho esto, tampoco debemos caer en el otro extremo, es decir, en idolatrarlos como si fueran elementos imposibles de recibir ninguna crítica. 

El “Scrabble” sigue siendo hoy, después de casi 70 años, un buen juego de mesa. El problema es que hace unas décadas no tenía muchas alternativas, hoy tenemos decenas de juegos de mesa mejores, por lo que su peso actual no debe ni puede ser el mismo. 

Sus puntos débiles son evidentes, a medida que avanza la partida puede volverse monótono, y terminar por poner los típicos monosílabos para sumar. Hay que fijar bien qué palabras valen y cuáles no para que no haya polémica. Además creo que con más de dos jugadores se puede hacer aburrido si tardan en poner palabra. 

Sin embargo la temática es muy interesante, y en cualquier caso es un imprescindible en la ludoteca de los más jugones. Otra ventaja es que suele ser del beneplácito de las chicas, por lo que es ideal para jugar en pareja. 

Un buen juego, con todas sus imperfecciones, pero que debemos de cuidar y apoyar para que siga 70 años más.

God does it suck to memorize words. My limit is that I am willing to memorize the 2's and 3's but refuse to start memorizing the obscure bingo words that you HAVE to know to be competitive. This means that I will always be a "casual" player, which sucks because I hate calling myself a casual player at anything. I want to win, damnit! But this game isn't worth the effort. Studying Chess is often interesting, while memorizing semi-random combinations of 7-letter words is not.

Why is this game so highly rated anyway? Because I still have a blast playing it "casually" with my mom and girlfriend, in spite of all my QQing. The game is actually quite deep, and I'm not talking about memorization. Rack-management (saving high scoring tiles while throwing off low scoring tiles ASAP) is very interesting and fun.

I really hate word games, so this is probably more me than it is the game. This is worse than many others for me because I have a near-complete inability to visualize words on the board. My turns are often long to the point of frustrating everybody (including myself) because I often cannot see anything on the board that is more than two letters. (I don't have much of a vocabulary problem, though I am a poor speller, so that doesn't help.) My in-laws have an open-dictionary house rule, but this is worse because then the perfectionist in me takes over, and I often still place somewhere suboptimal. Again, I don't think Scrabble is bad for what it is, but it's not any fun in the slightest for me.

Scrabble can be a fun game played casually with people that don't really want to learn any other games that I have on my shelves. Someone who doesn't study the game and require a dictionary at their side is really the only requirement I would have.

I'll never play this with [i]true[/i] Scrabble fans, though, because I don't want to sit around while someone else shows off that they have an impressive vocabulary. Knowing every possible two-letter word in Scrabble is like knowing the answer to every question in Trivial Pursuit: I don't know who you're trying to impress, but it's not me.

Scales well for two, three and four. Best with two as an exercise in strategy and tactics. Good chance to show off technical vocabulary, though QI will NEVER be kosher! For a non-gamer's game it can be unduly prone to analysis paralysis, which ruins it for me.

Deluxe Turntable Scrabble - Parker Brothers, 2001

This is the version with cherry wood tiles.  It is complete and in excellent condition.  Most of the scorepad is still available and the labels haven't even been put on the tile racks.  There are a couple of slightly whitened corners and a very small crease on the bottom of the box, but otherwise it is excellent as well.

I like it, but it's a bit wordy. Having read lots books is an advantage, but not as much as having a 2/3 letter crib sheet. The game's weakness are words that no-one knows but scrabble people. Like zo. Yea.

I have a lot of fun with this game.  Actually, more than I'd expect, since I am really bad at anagrams.  In fact, I don't like anagrams at all.  And a rack full of Scrabble tiles is nothing but a lot of anagrams waiting to be optimally solved.

I wouldn't like playing this competitively.  But it's fun to me when playing with family and friends who just want to sit back and have a good time with it.

RATING: N/A
In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.

Spelers moeten woorden neerleggen met de letters die ze hebben en kunnen daarmee punten scoren naar gelang de waarde van iedere letter en eventuele bonussen van de plaats van het woord. Je zult duidelijk merken dat de wat eloquentere mensen dit spel beter zullen kunnen spelen en zelfs met een ongunstige letterverdeling

Depends on the group, really.  Everyone really needs roughly an equal education level (or a LOT of spirit!) for this game to work, but it can be fun.  An interesting twist as a 'party game' is to play a game with a specific word theme.  And important to have an agreed-upon dictionary, too!  But...I dunno, something about it I just like.  It's a great game for a nice, slow evening with strong drinks and friends over.  Which can be important, as there is (potentially) a LOT of down time, so other conversation is almost required.

Nope. Not my game. Despite my, in my opinion, pretty large (Dutch) vocabulary. But just very few of those words contain an 'X', 'Q', 'Y' or 'C'. Also, it's annoying if there are only very short words on the board which makes it impossible to connect to. And you have to be lucky with the vowels.

RATING: 6.5
I'm ambivalent.  It's a classic for what that's worth, but not literate as it might seem, and certainly not strategic.  Entirely tactical, shallow and random.  Victory goes to him who has memorized the two-letter word list.

Dispite all this I'm always finding myself engaged in a dull trance about the phonemic patterns and the compulsion for the next word.

Still one of my favorites, and a game I've probably played over 100 times in my life. The discrepancy in experience and vocabulary can really come through, and I find fewer and fewer opponents willing to play -- either I'm far better or far worse than the folks I come across. Unfortunately, no one from my regular group wants to invest the time to get more out of the game. I far prefer playing with a timer to eliminate the onerous downtime between turns.

I still enjoy a good game of Scrabble from time to time.  The release I own is the Barnes and Noble Onyx Edition and I think it is very sleek, attractive and contains quality components.  The game play will be a snorefest for those who do not like word games.  Keep that in mind...

Scrabble is cardboard Valium for my wife; the last four times we played she fell asleep halfway through it.  I won't play it with her anymore.

[b]The Spanish version[/b], which was merged with this entry once I uploaded a photograph of it (not included with this entry), seems a little more fun to me, perhaps just because I don't see the same tired English words, and don't have to deal with Scrabble fanatics, as I don't know any of those who'd want to play the Spanish edition.

As for [b]the English version[/b]:
Good fun to be had here, but since the landscape upon which you can build a word changes right up until your turn, each player provides a lot of downtime as she tries to place a word in the new environment. I prefer a more "active" game, but this is certainly enjoyable on occasion. Wildwords spices things up with the Scrabble formula, but I prefer Upwords for a crossword game. Since it allows you to cover old tiles, the board landscape is far less dictatorial.

The best thing about this game is to keep decclining and conjugating words and watch your opponents complain :D

I don't know what it is about this game, but I either have a great time playing it or I'm bored to tears. I guess the thrill of recognizing an awesome word can't make up for the seemingly hours of waiting for the other players in some games.

People hypothesize that I excel at this endeavor based upon an extensive knowledge of obtuse  vocabulary. Nope. I'm good at this game because I know how to play the board and I know the 96 words that have 2 letters.

If the main idea is to spell words with randomly available letters, then clearly Boggle is purer and better.  There is nothing more irritating in all of board-game-dom than coming up with an ingenious, long word, only to be outscored by an opponent who places an 's' at the end of it.

After 50+ Plays: This is a game that gets more fun as the players become better at it, because your options on a turn increase dramatically if you know the 2 and 3 letter words well.

I rate this game low simply in the context of the STRATEGIC board gaming setting. I really do enjoy this game and play it occasionally I just don't feel it can hold a candle to even the simplest of strategy board games.

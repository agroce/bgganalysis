170101-nice concept for a portable flicking game, but not sure if I actually like it.  Need to try it with more than 2P.  If I'm feeling the same after that, I'm certain the score will drop precipitously.

Basically push penny but lovely pieces with a good feel and quality, and great design choices. 

Recommend for slipping in your pocket and taking down the pub. Want to buy.

I like the idea of this game and want to look into the team-game.  In-terms of head-to-head competition Push It seems to have winners largely determined by the turn-order with the last player having a vast advantage.  This observation is based on 4 or so games played on a 1.5 metre in diameter table.  That is not to say it's not a fun way to kill time but in terms of a game of pure skill, while far less practical, games like PitchCar are far better.

The quality of Push It largely depends on the table; you want a large table with a good, consistent surface.  Time will tell on this one.

Push it is, in short, the table-top equivalent of bocci or curling. Flick a disk towards the *target* disk, and keep doing so until you are the closest. Once all the disks have been flicked, the closest player to the target disk gets one point for each disk that is closer to it than any other player. First to seven wins. This is nothing new - but this is a slick, take-anywhere repackaging of a classic.

It's like "p√©tanque" but on a table.  A simple, fast, portable, no-setup, dexterity game.  Takes 30 seconds to explain and playable by all ages (4-99).  Great material!

Probably my favorite dexterity game. Like it more than Crokinole, although some may argue if they can be categorically compared. Much more portable, easier setup, and very small learning curve. I haven't run into anybody that does not enjoy this when it comes to the table.

Cheap edition of Crokinole, but it's still fun. Great components although you could easily use any kind of discs and play the homemade edition of this tabletop petanque - that's what 'Push it' is. Still... as I said, great fun!

Rating based on 2 players.

Simple fun, a flicking game at its purest without any fuss or added complexities. Probably better with four so there are more collisions and back-and-forth. (EDIT: sigh, only a few rules, and I still played it wrong! 1v1 was a lot more fun playing it correctly). Difficult to rate as I don't play a lot of these types of games, but I foresee myself actually carrying it around in my purse in the provided cloth bag, so it gets a solid 8.

Push it is a well made, compact, portable dexterity game in which you are trying to push, chop, punch or flick chunky wooden pucks to end up nearest the 'jack'. It is quick to understand, easy to play and fast. A winner with almost everyone I have played it with.

What a dexterity game. It has an insanely wide audience potential because it's basicaly table bocce, it's portable, easy to teach, pub-friendly and very cool to look at. 

This games generates both competitivness and laughter, which is a combination I just love.

Like a bad version of Crokinole, just flick the disks of your color to end up closest to the center piece. However it center piece can be moved so it is a free for all. Compact but otherwise not much fun.

Push It is brilliant. It's just a set of well-crafted and attractive wooden pucks that you flick across the table at a jack, scoring boules/bocce/lawn-bowls-style. The idea is that you can play it anywhere, particularly a pub table. They pucks are a great weight and slide really well too. It appears this (pretty obvious) idea has been done several times before (Tocce, Flicochet) but this is still a very nicely done version and I ordered my own set.

Sort of a simplified Bocce using small wooden discs, using any flat, smooth surface as the play area (I've never played Crokinole and cannot compare directly). The rules are easy and people intuitively grasp them. With a spouse or SO, you target one another's discs and glare at one another and trash talk, then you go shag because the game is an extended period of flirtation & foreplay. With more players, you laugh a lot and incorporate your beer bottles into the play area and try improbable ricochets. A really fun, simple game that plays well starting at about age 5.

For such a small and portable package, Push It manages to eke out more fun than I would have expected. It's yet another example of the adage, don't judge a book (or game) by its cover. I could easily see a label like "Poor Man's Crokinole" or "Tabletop Bocce" applying to Push It, and neither would be wrong or disparaging. If you're looking for a flicking game without the commitment in space or money, this might be the game you're looking for, especially if you want something that plays very, very quickly -- perhaps too quickly.

To play, four people get two discs each. Place a target disc in the center of any table. Each player in turn flicks a disc as close as possible to the target. And then starting with the person whose disc is farthest away (i.e., the lousiest player), everyone gets a second shot. That's it! Closest disc scores a point -- two points if you manage to get both your discs closer to the target than anyone else's. Of course if you hit the target off the table, you've really done it. The round ends early and you get a two-point penalty. Either way, set it up again and play another round. First to 11 wins.

In addition to these simple rules, the publisher encourages house rules. You can play with teams, place obstacles on the table, or any other manner of madness. For example, when we played, we didn't just set the target in the center of the table. Instead, whoever was the first player got to shoot the target towards the center of the table, thus ensuring a slightly different target position each round and adding a little bit of strategy to that first round-robin of flicking. I imagine that playing on different shapes and sizes of tables would also mix things up if you're so inclined.

As with Crokinole, there is a pleasant amount of strategy and fun that arises from simple rules of flicking discs. The strategy is simpler in Push It, which is really more on par with a pub game, but there's nothing wrong with that. Its portability and ease of setup is its advantage. It takes from games like Crokinole or outdoor Bocce and distills the package into something you can stick in your pocket.

However, that minimalism is also Push It's biggest flaw. Why oh why are there only two discs per player? To me, three would be the perfect number, allowing for more than just a quick dexterity challenge. As is, the game is so quick that I feel as though I'm missing out on what could be a better narrative arc per round. Yes, I realize I'm getting worked up over a pub game, and even then over the difference between two discs and three. But if we're talking minimalism, then small differences are the only things that matter. And with Push It, two discs is on the wrong side of maximizing the components to fun ratio. I want three!

Of course you could play one-on-one matches with four discs each, sure. That's fine. And I'm not saying the game is bad. Far from it, it's quite fun. I just think it could be better, could eke out a little more strategy, if it wasn't quite so minimal.

Simple and small and most importantly it's very carryable. Can be played on any non-sticky surface. Even in a pub. If you can find such a table there...

I just love it. The evolution of flicking games has been quite intricate, and here it returns to it's ideal simplicity with these perfectly sized & weighted wood pucks.  David introduced me to them on a visit & we played on the long, wood kitchen table & it was a hilarious way to come down from a game of Twilight Struggle that ended suddenly with one of those sudden, self-inflicted nuke endings and the wine buzz was just peaking so what better way to carry on?

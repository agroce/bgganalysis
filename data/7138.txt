Beautiful graphics and components and a system I like, but the logstics system in the game is a bit long winded. NES game expanded by the 'Overlord' module.

Getting back into this game after a long hiatus. The HQ/supply/operations mechanics in the game add a great deal of complexity to the basic VITW system, which is what drew me to the game initially. More of a simulation than a game, but it does provide insights into the actual campaign...I wonder if a simplified command and supply rule set could be developed to speed up play?

RATING: 7
My rating for this has bounced around drastically.  Overlord is neat.  The maps are gorgeous.  The educational value is high.  However, I have never made it more than 9 or 10 days into a game before my interest fell off a cliff.  I absolutely cannot internalize all of the subsystems surrounding supply and support.  I really want to get it, but I fear I don't have the discipline and the fortitude to do it.  

I give some of the experience a 10 and a lot of the experience a much lower score.

A much heavier & complex version of the Victory in the West system in a static game situation with very high stacking density. Not much enjoyable. Production is excellent but gameplay is disappointing.

An attractive game no doubt, but the praise heaped on this game for its graphical excellence is somewhat mystifying to me, mainly due to the counter colors which are a little dubious due to the low contrast.

I'd love to play this game someday. I just wish the complexity were more in line with Ardennes '44 or Ukraine '43. Still, I'll have to try to find time at some point.

I came to this having never played any of the Victory in the West games (from which this system has been developed). As I've found with most operational games, there's a lot to deal with when you start to play, but I also found that it clicked into place quite quickly.

This game has a very sensible system of supply - usually the bane of games at this scale. It also shows up the merits and demerits of each side, e.g., the Allied air and artillery strength, the German tenacity and use of terrain. However, I wonder whether it is perhaps a little too much of a model of what happened, pushing players towards historical tactics and decisions in order to succeed in their mission. Is that a bad thing? I enjoy it.

Best played with players that really want to explore this campaign in detail, I think.

RATING: 5
Might have kept it if it was simple and fast moving, like a Command game, because it is pretty. But it's slow, complex, slow, big, and slow.  Looked at lots of replay photos from others and could hardly tell the difference from turn to turn.  Guess it appeals to a certain kind of taste.  You certainly aren't going to have any "oh no, my entire army got encircled!" type disasters in this situation.  Seemed like most of the map went unused, behind the German lines.

Good simulation of the Normandy campaign.  The rulebook is long, thorough, pretty well written, and well organized.  Game play is a lot smoother than it would appear from just reading the rules.  Best way to get over the intimidation factor of the long rulebook is to jump in and start playing.  The basic movement and combat rules are pretty easy.  The bulk of the rest of the rules deal with supply, support, operations, and chrome.  Supply is probably more complex than it needs to be, but it works.  Very nice maps, counters functionally okay but a little on the bland side.

this is an example where too much information almost unsold the game. You see this game has everything I love in a WW II wargame - ZOC, reserves, combined arms and armor effects, artillery support, unknown strenghts. Plus it looks Mahvalous... I was ready to jump on it when I first heard about it. But then I started to read scary stuff about it....things like how complex it was, how long it took to play etc...I even had my friend's copy to fondle, and that 1st edition rule book didn't help sell me! 

But luckliy I came to my senses in time and bought it (and the expansion) heck I have Streets of Stalingrad, and that came aint no walk in the Park!

RATING: 8
Nothing really difficult about it, but just about everything you can think of is included in this simulation, and thereby takes a [i]serious[/i] commitment to play.

One of the rare wargames where "simulation" might be appropriate, as the game forces players to consider the restrictions and opportunities faced at the time, requiring careful detailed planning and foresight.  Should make for great 4-player campaign games, with the Allies splitting along nationalities (American, and Brit/Canadian/other), and the Germans splitting duties along army commands, all four roles offering different challenges.    NOTE: The learning scenario on Operation Luttich is not to be the most finely balanced exercise, but we found it works well to teach the system as was its intention.

TKG is one of the very few stand-alone games of this complexity I will play, and represents a fine example of how a game can provide insight into history.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
There is quite an intriguing puzzle in this game. Can the Allies get through the hedgerows in less than a jillion turns? Do they really have to? Should everything just go through the Caen sector? Can the Germans cut and run to make yet another defensive line?

I would rate higher if 
1) the combat odds calculation were a more streamlined system. Right now it is a long list of column shift modifiers to go through before each combat. Not a bad system but it does take quite a lot of time to run through the attacks. The plus is it gives a good sense of the arms/combined arms etc committed to each attack.

2) The situation itself is just too static and even worse as the German player has to be a masochist who gets hit again and again, then waits to get hit again with little chance to retaliate. One spends most of the time just building defensive lines. The game then teases the Allied player too in that a real breakthrough for the Americans seems just around the corner..... again and again. Not bad as a simulation, actually it works great as the game certainly follows the real battle no matter what one does. I really want to get the expansion to run the campaign from the beginning, I have taken the bait that somehow something can be done to change the course of the battle (either way!)

Great artwork and use of colours, definitely the standard others should look at.

RATING: 8
When one wants to talk about production quality, look nowhere else other than the standards of New Enland Simulation.  The map is the usual purely gorgeous NES standard, making the game an instant classic. The rulebook is, while sometimes mumbo-jumbo, generally a bliss to read.  Some minor errata are noted in the rules though (like the number of counter sheets...) At other times NES seems like to use a different set of wargame jargon to explain what they wanted to, e.g. "cases".  All these are rather unnecessary.  The rulebook number of pages perhaps can be reduced by about 20% if these kind of things are removed.  Hard and soft factors are both modeled by NES games and it is their strength to do such qualitative assessments to the units particpated in the campaign.  Airpower is explicitly demonstrated as a significant force to reckon with on the land of Normandie.  Overall, you can find many conditions and attributes represented and decisions have to be made about what are the best strategies and options out there for you.  There is not only one but certainly several possible options.

Derivative of sorts of the system used in V-i-t_W series.Fine tuned for Normandy Campaign. Ovelord Expansion makes it even better, but is not necessary to enjoyemnt of this one. Beats out old Atlantic Wall and The Longest Day on my table now for Normandy games. I acutally think TLD, while much larger, is simpler. This one is a bit fiddly--not exactly traditional or intuitive, so  has steep learning curve. A grognard's delight, its not for everyone.

I've played two scenario so far.

I cannot give a top rating: The map is very beautiful, but the American counters are not easy to read and the many shifts for the Combat Resolution are quite difficult to manage.

Otherwise, this seems THE Normandy simulation, and, as such, it requires time and brain commitment!

RATING: 9
Using a development of the very solid VITW system, this to me is one of the few games on the Normandy battles that gets the non-US Allied forces structure correct from the get go.  Yes it can be slowish paced, but then so was the actual campaign initially. The designer has a very good grasp of the issues and complexities facing 21 Army Group and it shows in the way the system melds historicity and game play. Not for the faint hearted but pleasingly the game itself maintains a pace and flow that keeps one coming back for more. Graphically as good as anything released by anyone else.

This is a great topic to game, and Killing Ground seems to a great job simulating it.  I would rate this higher, but it is cumbersome to play.  Stcking density is high, and there is a lot to keep track of.  I do plan on buying the expansion when it comes out.  It is fun, it just takes an effort to play.

A bit (OK, a lot) too much for my tastes. 

Takes the very playable Victory in the West system and seemingly tosses in the everything including the kitchen sink. I understand what the designer was trying to accomplish, but for me his model was a monstrosity.

Graphically however, this game is tops (nothing else imparts that retro SPI feel like this product) - just beautiful.

Sold.

This is a beautiful game. I just need to find time to play it. I have one in shrink with Overlord in shrink. IMHO these games ( TKG with Overlord) will one day become the game by which all D-Day games are compared to. Not for sale or trade at the moment! Probably never. I have two sons, one is leaning towards War Gaming. They refer to my game collection as "their legacy" LOL.

Take one of the best operational systems in terms of playability, add a real feel for design and graphical form and function. R|then mix that with solid playtesting, support and an awareness of the big historical picture. That's what I got out of this game. I came late to it but it's probably my most significant purchase boardgamewise since 1986, and could well end up being the only game in my collection to rival the area movement games in terms of playings.

Based on a short trial scenario. Puts the F in fiddly. Beautiful map, although it's hard to tell the difference between major and minor rivers. Lot's of interesting chrome (perhaps a tad too much...). Rating bound to change after proper play.

edit: Lowered the grade. Played part of the campaign. Too fiddly and quite slow. Still it captures the historical feel and is enjoyable as a four player game.

---even more editing: Really not my style. Too much work for very little result.

RATING: 10
The very best Normandy game experience in my humble opinion. Meaty, intense, chrome-ladden simulation. A real nail-biter all the way. Adding Overlord completes the experience by including the entire landings module and the June 6 start. Be forewarned however, that this small add-on injects the greatest amount of complexity with the very fiddly Day One rules, further modified by the dropping of rules and the adding of other rules as the first few days go on. Well worth the effort though.

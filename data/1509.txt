GAME: Dogfight
RANK: 4111

RATING: 6
Along with Formula 1 (Milton Bradley), this was the most played game of my childhood. My rating is based on the absolute heaps of fun I had back then. Tactical decisions and outguessing.

Threw out many parts for this when cleaning out Mum's house 5 years ago - doh!. I'm thinking of buying a copy again to play with my grandson in a few years.

RATING: 7
This game rates a 7 not because it is better than all the games here rated 6 or below, but because it was one of the early games published in the US that wan't either a radio, TV, or movie property, and was in some way, a harbinger to what board gaming would become in the next 30 years. For many of us, it was one of our very first games about war.

RATING: N/A
49 years old and still kicking!  American Heritage series...Red Stripe Box Edition.  Game is complete and all components and cards are all accounted for, but after all this time is showing a bit of age.  Box lid is dished, shows some shelf wear, and has one blown corner.  Card holders are complete and solid.  All four decks of cards for the different squadrons look new and are in super condition.  Anti-aircraft markers, ace tokens, plane stands, and wooden dice look super and unused.  All 12 planes are present and look nice and clean, but as I've noticed with my father's copy, the aged plastic gets a bit brittle.  6 of the 12 planes are perfect.  One American plane has lost its propellor shaft, but the small shaft and propellor are stored in a small baggy.  Two of the American planes and three of the German planes have a small split in the lower wing of these biplanes where the struts are attached.  They can all still be used in play.  There are also 4 extra propellors on the sprue.  Rules are inside box lid, but also in a nice eight page paper rule set.  A 30 page  booklet entitled "Air Fighters: A Concise History of World War I Fighter Pilots and the Planes They Flew to Glory" is also included as part of the game.

I loved playing this as a kid.  Unfortunately my mother lost the game when we moved to Florida (or sold it I don't know).  Anyway a light dogfighting game.  A little luck based, but I always had fun.  One of the fun parts was to fly into the enemy base and kill the planes on the ground.  You have to put out anti-aircraft markers, but not all of them would actually hit the plane.  I also liked becoming an ace.  As you shoot down more planes you can carry more cards.  I think this would be a nice filler if I had a copy.

I received this game in the early 1960's when I was a kid.  I liked the game okay but I just gave it a 5 because I was comparing it with the games of today.  As a kid I remembered finding the rules easy to learn and playing came quickly.  I especially liked the idea of the symbols that distinguished your plane as an ace.  The plastic stands were cheap and didn't last long so I couldn't put my aces on the stand that the planes sat on, thus showing my accomplishments.  It was a fun game and probably still is, especially for beginners.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple, loads of fun and plays quick. I'd highly recommend this game to everyone. It looks great with the little mini planes and is very easy to teach/learn. Game play is quick, so even if someone happens to not like the game, it won't overstay it's welcome and will be over quick enough.

Load up your weapons and pilot with his moves and pray for the best. These battles are deadly and chances are your pilot won't be coming home, but if he does he'll become an ace for the next take off and have better abilities and more fire power.

Look out below.....above.....and all around, as you never know where the next attack will come from. This is a very cool game.

I received this game when I was aged 13 on Christmas Day 1962. It is still the best Christmas present I ever received. My copy is over a half century old and a little beat up, but I still pull it out and play it every so often. This game, though its mechanics are simple and uses dice, actually allows for a great amount of strategic play. Don't dismiss it as a dumb luck game; it holds up well and can be rather intense. Having miniatures adds to the gameplay.

One of those games which is responsible for my being interested enough in games to acquire over a thousand of them. (Two others in this series, Broadsides and Civil War, also contributed.)  I still enjoy Dogfight on occasion, with young children interested in historical games. Just enough fog of war to keep the game going, and a few strategy decisions necessary to win. Thanks, Milton Bradley.

This one gets a 5 after re-writing the combat rules to include dice rolls to resolve combat. I also made the game point-based instead of wipe out your opponents planes, in order to win. Now, players fly missions behind enemy lines and back to base again to gather mission points or they can still win by wiping out the enemies planes. Also, I gave more options for Ace status. Fun little game after these changes or I would give it a 3.

This is one of those "it is what it is" ratings for a game that doesn't set out to be realistic or deep or any of that stuff. It's just a silly game with cool airplanes (for its time) with dice and cards to introduce a robust mix of luck and strategy, though with emphasis on luck.

It seems to be playable in 45 minutes or so, which is about as long as I'd want to play it. It's a decent little filler with a good theme that accomplishes what it sets out to do.

I love this game.  I played it when i was a kid with my cousin.  After teaching it to my son, I found that it has more to it than you would first see.  For instance, it teaches you that as your time in the war got extended the chances of your survival were small.  It also says that even aces can make mistakes and get themselfs killed.  My son liked it as well.  That shows how well it holds up.

One of the few games I have miraculously managed to keep since my early childhood in 60's. I have the John Sands Australian produced version (exactly like the American except for the branding, and absence of the heritage booklet) with all the inserts- I thought even then it was beautiful as a whole. Played countless times in the 70's, where opponents bent cards (loop and barrel roll) and marked the Hit and Miss around airports (had to paint over them). In that time lost only a red Fokker (remade faithfully in balsa wood) and a red german cross (remade from balsa also). Its worn; dog-eared; and split cornered; and I still love it. Bought a mint condition American version with booklet, still can't bring myself to replace beloved and worn units (which was the intention). Playing it recently with my brother I found it still plays well- simple, fast and fun.

You can go on about nostalgia all you want - a bad game is a bad game is a bad game. And this, my friends, is a bad game. Sure, the little planes are neat, but the movement system is the dumbest thing I've ever seen and the luck factor (do I have the card I need? Yes? Well done! No? I'm hosed) makes the whole thing pointless. This game should remain in your memory files as a fond childhood experience - don't try to relive it or you'll realize what a dopey kid you were for ever liking this dreck.

Looking at the pictures, I remember playing this as a kid.  With whom or when I don't remember, but I remember the cards and the map board.  Loved the theme, but it was surpassed for me by Richthofen's War and Fight in the Skies.

For a game from the early 60's, this has an unusual number of parts. The miniature planes are great, with detatchable top wings and propellers that turn. No wonder it's so collectible. As a kid, we had all of the American Heritage series games. This was probably the best from a gameplay standpoint, but Hit the Beach was always more of a family favorite in that it led to more fights.

Got it at the local thrift back around 72 or 73?  Loved the little planes.  Despite my love of sailing, I like this game better than Broadside.

With Dogfight and Acquire, my dad unintentionally turned me into a lifelong boardgamer. This game is an AmeriTrash classic, with cool plastic figures, tactics and cardflow strategy that put it decades ahead of its time. In my dreams, Fantasy Flight will get the rights and put this great game back in stores. The movement rules are slightly annoying.

A classic from youth. There are a lot better games out now on the theme, air combat, etc, but this one excels in simplicity for kids.

RATING: 7.5
This is a really simple system, that perhaps relies too heavily on luck, but I don't think that the dice or the cards ever interfere with the fun.  It is great tooling your planes around getting yourself in position for the kill.

There is no reason why Hasbro shouldn't reissue this.

This and Broadsides are easily the best of the American Heritage series.

I love my old American Heritage series games.  I rate them as I would have felt when I played them 40+ years ago.  It is simply not fair for me to rate them in comparison to today's game.

Good to play with young aspiring wargamers, but (unlike Broadside, say) too many random and gamey aspects for any real strategy or challenge.

Bought this as an adult, to play with the kids.  As with Carrier Strike, very cool plastic airplane pieces (Fokker D.7 and Spad XIII).  Put planes in the air, seek out enemy planes to dogfight (resolved by cards), attack the enemy aerodrome if you can.

what a fun game to play with the kids. Adults seem to get upset when you shoot their ace down. Three games complete all cards. One extra for parts, but it's complete to. All MB

Acquired my copy about 1967 and still have it...and played it as recently as 2011.  Very simple and would not pass the "mustard test" today against other World War I aviation games.  But...when it came out, it was way ahead of its time in trying to simulate dog fighting.  Uses a simple card draw system.  Cards have maneuvers or gun bursts that can be applied against the other player.  The 8 rating is for its innovation when released in 1962.  Other WWI aviation games today have to look back at this at "grand pa" and setting a foundation for them.

Just got this at a garage sale for $1. Played it a couple of times with my son. It's not too bad. You do need to think to take best advantage of the movement rules and your hand. To get more cards, you need to land your plane back at your home airstrip. Neat!

Played for the first time with my 9 yr. old daughter. She liked it but did get frustrated with die rolls. We will definitely have to try again. The small amount of strategy involved does definitely help this game. Positioning planes from both squadrons does help to attack as a team.

Excellent game for young people.  I grew up with this one when Snoopy was my favorite ace.  Game provides an age-appropriate sense and visual feel for the air-superiority element in World War I air combat ('aces & aerial victories' and all that).  Evocative trench-line mapboard and miniatures (Fokker D.VIIs and SPAD 13s), Jastas and pursuit squadrons, basic fighter maneuvers and ammunition supply (alas, no fuel constraints, but the attrition rate is Bloody-Aprilish anyway, so missions tend not to last too long).

Try it with four players, coaching your teams to see if they can merge and master section tactics.

Excellent precursor to 'Wings of War/Glory'.  In some ways, 'Dogfight' actually presents a more accurate sense of the history.  In 'Dogfight', you take hits, you die.  In WoW/G, the wood-&-canvas crates make B-17s look like Zeros.

Dogfight is a very good design for its age.  Using dice for movement makes it feel a little too random, but the attack/evade nature of cardplay for combat makes it very enjoyable.

I had this as a kid. The 7 rating has to be a bit nostalgic. I played with the little airplanes more than I played the game. The little handbook was great. American Heritage history of WW1 air combat.

RANK: 1968

RATING: 10
Had an absolutely incredible gaming experience playing this.  The art and the puzzles, and how they work together, is mind blowing.  

WARNING: IMO You need at least 4 people to really enjoy this, because you have to split up into 2 groups at the beginning.

RATING: 5
Really mixed feelings about this one. The cooperation part of this was brilliant and worked really well. Unfortunately, the rest degraded into frustrating puzzles and is easily marred by their stupid hidden number system which are incredibly easy to miss. The Exit games do a much better job at hidden numbers.

This was the most interesting of the Unlock games that we played and also the most difficult. I felt quite a bit dumber as a human being after playing this game even though all of the solutions made sense. Fun and challenging.

RATING: 6
This unlock game starts out with (not a spoiler as it's instructed before you even reveal your first card)two groups separated and unable to speak with each other, which prevented my wife and I from playing it at first. It is decent but possibly my least favorite escape room type game I've played so far. The two team aspect was interesting at times, but could be incredibly frustrating in the way it was handled at others.

Best with 4-6 players. I'd recommend the other 2 unlock games (with 2-3 players) or all 3 exit games first though.

RATING: 7.5
This was much more challenging than the Formula and I would recommend to play with either 4 players or 6 players. There are quite a few puzzles to solve in this one, some of which were quite difficult. I liked the twist of this scenario and thought it was well implemented.

RATING: 5
I liked this the least of the first three Unlock! games.  Having everyone split into two teams at the beginning is an interesting idea but there are no directions: Can you talk to each other?  Show each other cards?  An early puzzle requires you to do something to solve it that you may have thought is not allowed.  Other puzzles in the game had easy solutions but it was unclear what to do with those solutions (until we got a hint).

Skip this one.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS FOR THE 2017 UNLOCK ESCAPE ADVENTURES SERIES:[/b]

++ A more visual version of Escape Room games where you really need to check the cards for hidden informations (feel different than the EXIT series).
++ Good sense of exploration that remembered me some memories of old "point and click" adventure PC games.
++ Non-destructible, so the game can be passed along when done (so it's a better value in the end).
++ It uses an App for the timer, the hint system, some code validation, and other stuff which is nice. It can add so much possibilities to the game system (but right now, not much of these possibilities are used unfortunately).
++ The App also feature some music that add to the theme and feel when playing the game, which is also nice.
++ Relatively easy to pick up and learn (but still easy to forget how some card types work, which can lead to some time lost).
++ Good artwork.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS FOR THE 2017 UNLOCK ESCAPE ADVENTURES SERIES:[/b]

-- It feel more like finding items or codes by looking at the cards, searching for clues, instead of solving riddles using our brain.
-- It's hard for everyone to see correctly the cards when spread out on the table so I suggest that you pass along the cards for everyone to meticulously check them, especially for the hidden numbers. Also, be in a well lit room (skip trying to put ambiance by dimming the lights!).
-- Some puzzles are for the most part somewhat straightforward and easy once you have all the information required, especially considering the way this game work mechanically (adding two objects together, to find the solution card). So the game feel more like finding every cards required to find the answer rather than solving interesting riddles using our brain power.
-- Hidden numbers are frustrating: I know it tries emulate the players searching for clues in the room, but in a real escape room, every player has a good chance at seeing the room correctly and here, in practice, we are looking at 3.5" high by 2.5" wide cards (see the point above about  the difficulty to easily see the cards).
-- Unfortunately, it's easy to get stuck somewhere in the game, for the wrong reasons, often because you just have missed a hidden number, or forgot that a card result can give you a new card to look at. This result in a game experience with a really uneven flow (sometimes you are stuck for 10 minutes, then you find 4 answers in a row within 2 minutes), which result in frustration when you are not going forward, and not really satisfying when doing these quick streaks.
-- The hint system is not great. When you are stuck, you may have to ask for several hints to know in which direction you should go. Also, some hints are worthless to you, as you already know this information when asking for hints and these hints still count against your final score (in a real Escape Room, the game master will check where you are at before giving you a hint, so they are usually all good). The hint system should probably be done something like this instead: 1) Player ask for help, 2) the App ask some numbers of the last few puzzles that were solved and check the last code entered successfully, 3)then the App give a hint about a numbered card but that is useful at this time for the players (the same way that real game master ask check the progress of the players before giving a hint). This way, the hint would always be useful to, at least redirect the players on the right path (to know where they should focus) and players would not waste time on hints about a card that should not be worked on at the moment.
-- Using a bad code or a bad combinaison should not give you a 3 minutes penalty (it's kind of harsh, especially if you just make a mistake when entering the numbers). You already lost time trying stuff instead of thinking about the puzzle. In a real Escape Room, if you decide to use this "technique" of trying out stuff instead of thinking, you just lose the time you took trying out stuff, not more.
-- When the App play out a recording, the volume of the music should be automatically lowered to like 50%, in order to be able to correctly hear this audio clues.
-- It's a one-and-done game. But hey, every escape room game are (board games or the real deal).


**************************************************


:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

++ Some interesting puzzles (4 or 5), with bit more thinking to put into them, and probably just the right difficulty for us (to have a good challenge).
++ A nice use of the App possibilities with this one (Hearing recordings).
++ Really good theme in this one, with a greater sense of exploration of this weird place.
++ Although we had a lot of frustration while playing this one, it's the best of the 2017 Unlock Escape Adventures series.


:thumbsup: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

-- At the 2-players count, the first part of the game where you are separated into 2 teams is not really fun, as one person may have to wait a long time for the other until they are both able to communicate to continue going forward (so it's frustrating as you cannot help your teammate, which goes against cooperation). I would suggest playing it with 4 people, in order to at least have 2 teams of 2 people.
-- The final puzzle was really non-thematic and easy (at least for us), so that kind of ruin the fun and climax in the end of the game.

RATING: 5
A great puzzle but certainly more activity than game to me. With this one you split into 2 teams in order to complete the escape which I didn't like because it did involve waiting around for the other group at times. I also felt one or two puzzles were exceptionally difficult when trying to communicate with each other. One of them took 40 minutes of our time to solve and I don't see how anyone can figure these out quickly. That turned the entire thing into a 110 minute affair which felt like a grind at times. Once we got through those early hurdles though the majority of puzzles were actually quite fun. I would have no interest in buying into this sort of activity, but if others bring Unlock! to a game night I would have no problem trying another one.

Rating is for this specific puzzle and not the entire Unlock! series which I could see other puzzles being higher rated given the system.

I enjoyed the presentation of this game more than the exit: pharaoh's tomb, but at one point we were pretty stumped and since it was just my husband and myself-we were thematically not "together" in the story, in the end we still figured it out, but i would have liked an additional "hint" in general button.

Components: Great illustrations; detailed maps; objects that really seem set in the terrain (e.g., I can see it from far away on the map, but then up close on the card). Elegant game system: nothing but cards and an app, and only a few types of cards.

Experience: My first “escape room” game. The number-based system is clever, mostly straight forward, and yet still had some breathing room to support several types of behavior within that system. I liked how the game gently guided us toward the right answer, but did penalize us on occasion for making the wrong choice (adding together two numbers that had no valid result). There were only a few times when we looked at a card we shouldn't have because we had accidentally broken the rules.

The various puzzles were great, and mostly felt distinct from each other. Only a couple were frustratingly difficult, and a few were a joy to figure out (the moment when the two groups unite was one of my favorite gaming experiences in recent memory). 

It took us more than three hours and several hints from the app to finally get through, but I was engaged almost the entire time (except for a few long stretches where we were stuck). Played over two sessions; unfortunately the app didn't remember our place in the game, but luckily it didn't force us to re-discover codes before granting access to other codes.

Lots of fun. Can't wait for another in the series, and for other series.

Hated this one. We got stuck on one card - the hint made us skip ~10 cards - which confused everything. This basically is the end of escape rooms in a box for me.

My family (wife, daughters 12, 13 yo) had a great time unlocking The Island of Doctor Goorse. This is the third in the Unlock series that we have played. It proved to be the most challenging, primarily because the group is split from the beginning (not a spoiler) and we struggled establishing radio contact. Once contact is established, it becomes a game of "telephone" as the two parties communicate about the cards they see. Some have complained about this. We liked it. Once this clicked for us, we moved along at a nice pace, but it still took us 2 hours. We enjoyed it! The puzzles continue to be clever and logical. There are some real gems here. The theme is very strong! We definitely felt immersed in a world of archaeological artifacts. The art is large, clear, and significant!

 I recommend playing with four players.

The Unlock series continues to offers the best escape room experiences in a box.

Starts out splitting your team, which is a nice switch up. However, it seems one team gets more to do than the other in the beginning, so one team might be sitting around waiting for unlock from the other side. At least, this was our experience. We “brute-forced” the last puzzle so we’re not sure exactly how it was supposed to be solved — it made no sense to us — but we got the right answer anyway and were left rather dissatisfied.

Definitely the hardest out of the first 3 Unlock! episodes (the others being The Formula and Squee & Sausage). Serves us right for doing the hardest one first, I suppose.

[For reference: My game group consists of escape room enthusiasts who have a combined play of 200+ unique escape games plus created more than a dozen escape games of various number of players and execution levels, so we’re extreme puzzle addicts.]

RATING: 7
We failed miserably at this one, but I still enjoy reflecting back on the puzzles now that I know how they were supposed to work. Definitely very challenging. Too bad we didn’t pick up on them sooner.

Splitting up into teams was a neat idea, but it did create some confusion and frustration.

My least favorite of the initial 3 Unlock! games.  The other two you could figure things out by imagining yourself in each room.  The Island of Doctor Goorse requires you to assume a perspective in some places that are impossible given the circumstances.  I think this one stretched for its difficulty rating too far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The worst of the Escape Adventures by far. The teams are very poorly balanced, one team gets all of the fun and interesting puzzles and almost every relevant piece of information, while the other team simply acts as support, they don't have their own puzzles and only has to feed information to the first team. It was such a great idea, but extremely poorly executed. The puzzles themselves were less interesting and clever and relied more on reading and perception. We just though it was a boring exercise and not a fun puzzle; with other adventures we could feel smart by solving some of the puzzles because they required some lateral thinking, here you mostly had to count or cross-reference stuff.

If I had played this part of the trio first, I probably wouldn't have bothered with the other ones. Don't buy this as a stand-alone, but it's fine as a bundle-in.

This scenario was ridiculously hard if you follow the rules. We gave up on the rules halfway through (we showed our cards to the other team), and it was still very hard.

I wanted to enjoy it more than I did, but it was super difficult, which sucked the joy out of it. My other major issue is that you split into two teams when you enter the island. The teams cannot share cards, but eventually they can talk. Since they cannot share cards (until they meet back up), I have no idea how one of the puzzles could be solved. I had to read a hint guide.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
A mix of some good puzzles with some really illogical and bad ones. Being divided into two teams means that sometimes players in one team has to wait for the other team to complete their puzzle in order to advance. A pretty frustrating scenario.
Also, turn up the volume on your phone when playing this scenario (we did the opposite and lost a LOT of time because of it).

I was very excited about the concept of two different team, but found the implementation lacking. There were too many puzzles at the same time, with a lack of clarity about whether any could be solved by your team or which ones could currently be solved with the help of the other team. There was a lot of clever twists which increased my rating, but I would only recommend to a very specific gaming group.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2017)

I´m really enjoying the Unlock! Series of games, and I was very keen to play Unlock! The Island of Doctor Goorse which is the hardest of the trilogy. The game really delivers!

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do in under 1 minute or have players play the tutorial. I´m a bit disappointed this game comes with the same tutorial than the other to Unlock! games, but this is a minor issue.

I like the theme. The art of the cards is very good.

Unlike the past two Unlock! Games, this one plays better with 4 players. I made the mistake of playing it alone with my SO and she haven’t played any Unlock! game before so it was a very hard game for us (particularly for her as she didn’t know what to expect). I won´t spoil anything, but this one adds some rules that make the game a lot harder. It took over 4 and a half hours to finish it. The puzzles are much harder than before and I was very frustrated (in a good way). I thought I was a lot better at solving puzzles :D.  I´m afraid I have to confess we cheated a bit on this one (again I won’t say in what way to avoid spoilers) but all of this could have been avoided if we played it as a 4 player game. The high playtime was because we avoided hints as much as possible. Each time we solved a puzzle unaided we felt victory!

I have a bittersweet feeling about the game, like T.I.M.E Stories, once you played through it, you won’t play it again because you already know the answer so it has zero replay value. At least in Space Cowboys´ games you don’t physically destroy the game, thus preserving the resale value. That’s the only reason I bought the whole series of games while I can’t buy The Exit series of games. It isn’t about the money though (the game itself is very cheap), I was raised in a third world country and I was always taught that you do not waste if you can avoid it so I loathe legacy style games that destroy or permanently modify the game. To me, it is immoral and unethical to create games that are disposable (even more when the designer can easily make them resettable), even if they create a great experience. Kudos to Space Cowboys for not doing this. 

I really like the new elements they added to this game (I won’t spoil anything :D). It’s great to see the variances between games and how flexible the Unlock! System really is. Good Stuff.

Bottom line, I really like Unlock! The Island of Doctor Goorse, perhaps, the best of the series for me. I was frustrated by its difficulty, but I really like hard games. Its puzzles are much harder than before and you need to think in other ways. I don’t recommend it as a two player game. From now on I will play the easy Unlock! games with 2 players and the hard with 4 players. After some friends enjoy it as well, I will sell it (it has zero replayability, so there is no point to keep it among my game collection) , I already have a buyer waiting for it.

This one was hard coming of Squeek & Sausage.  (Although I feel it didn't rely on hidden numbers as much, and the ones that were there were much more interesting).

I really think this was the worst Escape Room scenario I've played (among all the Exits and other Unlocks). Conceptually, I understand what they were trying to do (i.e. split up the team and have them work separately), but it didn't work well. And many of the puzzles were poorly designed and lazy.

I like the mechanic of the Unlock! series (cards which add together to "unlock" the next card), the hidden elements, and some of the lateral thinking approaches.  Despite this, I think the types of lateral thinking puzzles and the approach leave a lot to be desired.  In most puzzle games (and in real escape rooms) there is a sense of "aha!" when you uncover the puzzle and its solutions.  Unfortunately (for me), I never get that feeling with these puzzles, only frustration, and a sense of "really?  that's what you were going for?"  I can't really recommend these games (we've played two).

This is my third Unlock game. I liked this one much more than the other two I played. There were some really clever puzzles and fun moments. The gimmick of having to start in two groups working on separate things was a good change.

RATING: 9
Clever puzzles. Best for 2-4 players. Doesn’t have much replay value, unless you can make yourself forget the solutions. Very difficult to beat in time alotted. Requires a lot of communication about card info back and forth because two groups aren’t allowed to share cards during the first half of the game.

Here's the thing - I still want to like Unlock!  And the splitting the group thing is... novel?  Yeah, let's go with novel.  But it also was super frustrating to sit there with nothing to do on one side while the other side flailed frantically and there was nothing you could do until they figured out what they'd missed.

Also, this one didn't really do the impossible to spot tiny number thing (One of the two mechanic of this game system that I loath) but it did do an awful lot of hiding numbers in plain sight - in ways that make no logical sense and that, out of a group of five, only I was apparently good at spotting.  So that's an improvement for me personally, but not for the overall game experience.

Some really good puzzles. Some really unfun puzzles. This version compared to other versions in the series had some nice spatial puzzles. It also had some (important endgame) puzzles that didn't fit thematically.

A fairly tough challenge. Some of the puzzles were really cryptic, and some things we just didn't figure out at all. But the rest was fun, and there were some quite clever bits as well.

Suggest.

A ton of fun, really enjoyed this one, but definitely challenging. We played with 3 because we have 1 very strong puzzle solver, but I would highly rec7ommend only playing with 4 because it is incredibly challenging with less. Strong 4 person group and it should be a great experience.

Unlock! The Island of Doctor Goorse is a cooperative escape room-style game that's all contained in a single deck of cards (and a mobile app).  Like other games in this genre, this game is meant to be played through only once, though no components are destroyed and the game can be played by another group.  What differentiates this from other games in the Unlock series is that this one separates the players into two groups, who are prohibited from sharing cards or even communicating until later in the scenario.  This allowed it to be played better at a higher player count, though it still can be a little hard to see cards with so many people crowded around the table.  I do like the numeric deck system, especially where cards that are no longer needed get cleaned up, but I still need to get used to the ability to just draw a card if I find that number on another card.  I did think the final set of puzzles was a bit too hard on this one, but overall I think this was a fun experience.

Maybe it was because we played this one first, but we found several of the puzzles to be very difficult and without clues they would've been unsolvable.

As this is a puzzle, and not a game, I cannot rank it according to the suggested BGG rating parameters.

However, that being said, it's a lot of fun, and does an escape room justice. Worth the buck provided you recognize it has no replay value and is in fact, not a game from a technical standpoint.

This was the worst Unlock! game I have played thus far. Enjoyed the other two quite a bit more. 

A bit of spoiler's here: The part where you are forced to split into two teams was not enjoyable for us. Most of the fun here is working together, and having the group forced to be apart wasn't what I wanted. I enjoy these games as cooperative puzzle solving, not as an exercise testing my verbal communication skills.

Look, I've been enjoying the Unlock! card system, and some of the puzzles really are quite good.  I specifically love the last puzzle right at the end of this one.   A fantastic way to end the game on a high note.  Pun intended.
But hey Space Cowboys, if you're listening... obtuse logic =/= higher difficulty.   It feels like you went way out of your way on this one to make some puzzles needlessly opaque with no payoff.
Also, I liked the idea of splitting two teams of players up and having them pass messages to eachother, but in this scenario one team (Egyptian) got most of the puzzles to work through, while the other team (Greek) got to sit around with very little to do.

We've only played one other escape room game and while they felt fairly similar, this one wasn't as good.  It's decent.  It felt that the puzzles in this one took a considerable leap to solve in some cases.  Not very elegant, but doable.

I think this one would best be played with 4 people.  It says 2-6.  I would recommend 4 or 6 only.

The tutorial in this one is great - very well done.

Goddammit, Unlock. The puzzles are fine, sometimes even clever. The series is my least favorite of all the escape room games though. The instructions are vague, needlessly obtuse, and sometimes flat-out wrong. We've "failed" both Unlock decks we've tried, and neither time because we couldn't solve a puzzle. Knowing how to play the game shouldn't be the hardest puzzle in it, and The Island of Doctor Goorse was the worst of the two we tried. I'll still play another though.

RATING: 7.9
This was my favorite Unlock! adventure! It took several cues from puzzle adventure games that I absolutely love (including one unmistakable cameo), and the split team aspect for this scenario worked well for us.

It WILL NOT work well for everyone. At one point one of the teams was at the mercy of the other--waiting for a clue so that they could continue the game--for several minutes. That team had the benefit of a bossy player keeping the other team on task, despite all sorts of distracting leads to follow. I'm pretty confident this will happen to most players, leaving half of them frustrated.

Once again, this one had a few rushes of eureka-euphoria, including a very powerful moment after reading a very clever clue...

Right off the bat, the gimmick of splitting players into two teams makes this a memorable scenario. Especially since there are a few puzzles which require information to be relayed between the teams. Unfortunately, it's also apparent that one team receives the lion's share of activities to perform.

I enjoyed playing this one with just me and my husband. We were nervous about the idea of each working by themselves, but it wasn't an issue. I would actually recommend playing with only 2. We used a lot of hints and turned off the timer (end time was 67 mins) - we ended up with a 3/5 star rating but we got through it and had fun which is what's important! 

I'm interesting in trading this one with another one in the series (escape adventures or mystery adventures) within the US.

Definitely the weakest of the series. We played the other two before this one, and what the other ones have trained you to do does not apply to this game. Also, I did not like the group having to split up--it really defeats the purpose.

RATING: 7
This one is a good entry that suffers, in our opinion, from two issues. The special rules from the start were so poorly explained that we lost a lot of time and hints before we even understood *how* to proceed. After that, the game was really interesting, with some fun and clever puzzles, all the way to the final puzzle, which, though, was really problematic for us.

RATING: 7.5
Great scenario where players split into two teams (as such, best played with 4+), allowing for a number of puzzles requiring cooperation/collaboration -- describing symbols, positions etc.

Some of the puzzles make no sense whatsoever thematically, but there's major variety and some brilliant "how did we not see that?!" twists. I like the cinematic nature of the mirror puzzle, too. Just fantastic.

Much harder than "The Formula". I suspect that playtesters also found it too hard given that the app provides several hints without even asking for them (e.g. for a certain wrong code in answer to the record puzzle).

It does lose half a point because the team split does have some negative effects, such as one side having to wait for the other. The higher level of difficulty also makes it much easier to get stuck. That hadn't happened before, but we had quite a frustrating time with one puzzle -- we got the number wrong but thought that it didn't work because a modifier was required. Still, thoroughly enjoyed.

This was out first escape room game. Judging by the difficulty rating, the developers think this is the toughest Unlock! game they've released. It was probably a poor jumping off point...

We came nowhere near finishing the game in the allotted hour, but about 40 minutes later, after cheating our way through a few smaller puzzles, we did make some huge breakthroughs. One solution in particular was pretty creative and I had a real sense of accomplishment after solving it.

Pros: A very entertaining hour of play. 
Too many things for us to complete in an hour. 

Cons: Price. Got it for 5$ and wouldn't pay more.
Not replayable. 
Would recommend getting Squeek and Sausage first. It was a bit easier and was a more fun experience overall. I haven't played the others in the series.

Part of "Unlock - Escape Adventures". This one was the best of the three, but it has two big issues: the fact that one of the two teams has more interesting things to do during the first part, and the final puzzle (which is incredibly hard to figure out). So, it all evens out: same rating as the base game.

The polish of app is too rubbish and the mechanism is lack of substitution feeling for me even with a timer to increasing the intensity，it s all about compare numbers.And after all，one time play is unexceptable with such an experience.Unsatisfied but meanwhile means a nice game I will play several times if possible lol...

[b]After playing all three of the Escape Adventures series (Squeek & Sausage [2p], The Formula [5p] and The Island of Doctor Goorse [5p])[/b]:

Oh well, I don't think escape room games are for me. While they've proven to be very involved, engaging and thematic, they're not the most satisfying gaming experiences. More than challenging I find them head-banging-on-the-table frustrating, the main culprit being the overly cryptic puzzles. I guess it doesn't help that I'm not a huge fan of IRL escape rooms either, but I'll give Space Cowboys credit for recreating that same experience in tabletop format. Having a group that's familiar with the genre helps out significantly. Wouldn't mind trying out Mystery Adventures in the future. The more players, the merrier and would recommend at least 4p.

Verdict: [b]6[/b]

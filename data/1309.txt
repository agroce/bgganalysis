Very neat morphing board offers some interesting tactical moves. The rules are fairly straight forward and not too long but there is a lot to think about in this game. The game does come to an end quickly which is too bad but if you know about this it eases the 'it's over already!' feeling.

I like this one a lot.  The modular board and shifting tiles make for a very dynamic game.  You do need to play agressively, though, making sure you don't set up the guy to your left for an easy score.  I am very glad I managed to snag a copy.

RATING: 5
Lots of options in this game. It got interesting mechanics. You try to get and transport amulets. There are different races, magic can be used and even the layout of the world changes. File under advanced eurogame.

Quite a good wander and fetch game.  The ability to re-shape the land tiles adds a (sometimes frustrating) twist.  Probably best as a 2-player.  With more players there is too little control.

After sitting on the shelf for years in its shrinkwrap, this recently came on the table as a quickie filler. The game was a pleasant surprise and multiple replay requests brought it out again the very next week, always a good sign in a large collection. 
 
I'm getting a bit bored with all the trading games with similar mechanisms just now, so this pick-up-and-deliver game across drifting tiles was a welcome diversion. Had this wrongly down as a pretty looking fantasy game, it's more an abstract "there-and-back-again" when both "there" and "back" are constantly on the move. Nice. Several clever resource mechanisms hiding in a deceptively simple game, and it seems that different strategies are as viable, making replay fun. Certainly would like to explore it more. Not necessarily "just" a filler either with a changing modular board, interesting resource management and manipulation, blocking options, and alternative victory conditions. Should be played at pace though, we tend to think too much. Do take into account that I quite enjoy "screw the leader" games where the game obviously intends that to be part of it (and I'm not in the lead). Here it certainly builds up to a puzzling endgame. People who dislike that genre will rate it much lower. 
 
variant: Quick skimming of the rules in our first play made we got initial set-up for our first game wrong, by not supplying 'neutral' towers with their peebles. As a result symbol-providers were initially in short supply, and made the journeys to get them all the more challenging. On reflection I think I prefer this unintended "variant" as it made the game a bit longer but more challenging somehow. Having to send your peebles further afield or alternatively investing more time to manipulate providers close by gave the game the right length to me. I know we play it as a quickie but a premature end, just when it gets going, can feel a bit like an anti-climax.

RATING: 7.5
I am very taken with this game. There are plenty of choices to make and very good player interaction. While the kingmaker aspect is there, finding ways to avoid this seemed to add to the enjoyment of the game for me... The concept of the 'round' board is great and the consequences of this can sneak up on you if you aren't paying attention and help you greatly if you remember to use it wisely. There are many ways to win and the game can end very suddenly.

RATING: 4
Some interesting elements (the tile shifting), but the pacing of the game really turns me off.  The initial turns are not very interesting since everyone only has one spell.  The later turns are a fun exercise in trying to keep everyone else from winning while going for the win yourself.  Unfortunately this only lasts a couple of turns because invariably someone isn't messed around with enough and they scoot in for the win.  Just not interesting enough for me to want to play it.

RATING: 3
Magier von Pangea is kind of a puzzly race to acquire a set of resources.  You'll get them by sliding pieces of land around, and running your guys around those land tiles.

Overall, it's kind of a boring puzzle, as you try to get your guys into position while messing other players up.  Adding to the kind of boring game play is that the same things you need to win also make you stronger in the game.  So, once a player breaks into the lead, not only is he winning, but he's stronger than the other players.  This creates obvious problems that are perhaps bigger in games with less players, since there are less opponents to mess with that player.

Overall, a game I'd only play again if everyone else really wanted to play it.  Otherwise, it's a pass.

This game has an odd quality that it is almost too simple at first. It builds nicely, however, making it more interesting as the game progresses. I do agree with the comments that the game usually ends too abruptly. Also, I like it more when I've been playing it recently; I always seem to have to warm back up to this if it's sat around too long...

RATING: 3
The rules seem simple enough on the surface, but once you're in the actual game there are a lot of things to keep track of, and making a single big mistake can literally be a game ender. Very confrontational for a Euro, a plus for me, and one of the reasons I picked it up originally. Cute graphics, and some neat ideas too. I also liked the way the neutral players worked out in practice, having all players able to control them, in addition to the shifting of the lands makes for a very fun and dynamic experience. 

The game is a little dry though, and the game seems to end just as it gets going. Dealing with the neutral player's minion bags and such is also a tad fiddly, though completely necessary for the system to work. A big rich get richer problem though, if someone can get an early advantage in amulets they become very hard to stop as they have more spells to spend on thwarting other players and putting themselves in a better position, thus necessitating collusion from the entire table. 

The end game also seems to have potential kingmaker issues ala Attika where everyone needs to thwart everyone else continuously. Past a certain point, everyone has to collude to stop the leader, in the process more potential winners creep up, and eventually everyone is trying to stop everyone else from winning: this ultimately turns into a situation where you can only stop 1 person on your turn and more than 1 has the ability to win as a result of that choice. In other words, once you get to the end game one lapse in judgement will end it all and there are plenty of situations where you can even see what is going to happen, but only have the ability to choose who wins rather than being able to actually do something about it. This makes the game particularly vulnerable to the dread "the bad player is the person sitting to your left, so you lose" syndrome, as this is a game where having your right-hand neighbor being somewhat less attentive than the rest of the table is the surest road to victory.

This game isn't bad per se, and breaks some new ground with its interesting land movement and magic mechanisms, but I am not at all a fan of games that require continuous collusion from the table to prevent run-aways or outright wins. The land mechanism is definitely the best thing here, but I would much rather see it re-used than re-visit this title.

Very interesting game of production, magic and delivery. You have to buy magic amulets from your opponents and get them back to your tower. Your minions do the transporting and also the production of goods used to purchase the amulets. Each amulet also gives you extra power to perform more actions.

Good game if you like the ability of players to constantly block each other, and try to balance helping yourself vs hindering someone else.

RATING: 6
Components: Attractive, soft art. Fun wooden amulet pieces. The minion tiles would be better served as stubby wooden discs, like the resource marker; they are difficult to flip without disrupting the board, especially if there are several minions on the same land tile.

Experience: Odd game. The first half of the game is slowly strategic, as we pick the low hanging fruit of nearby amulet vendors. Then suddenly we can both cast more spells, and the shape of the world quickly changes, and poof! the game is over.

The most interesting decision is probably which spell(s) to cast. It's usually straight forward about where to move minions (either to manufacture goods or to fetch amulets); it's automatic to buy an amulet, especially while the price is low; and deciding which tile to lock with my token is usually obvious. That's a bit of a let down, that most of the game is on auto-pilot.

Still, it's amusing to see our minions fan out across the world. I like the variable board, the variable minion draw, and the three (similar) victory conditions.

Thematically, it doesn't make any sense that our minions can only buy amulets from those of another tribe, even when we're both manufacturing goods on the same location.

Seems like it would be very chaotic with more than 2 players.

Oh, this one should be so good, but it's not.  It degenerates into fast-paced tactical place-management until someone misses something their neighbor can do to win.  Too bad -- great idea.

Preliminary rating, I need to play more. Superficially a simple "earn money buy stuff & get it home" game, but with lots of different ways to stymie your opponents. Moving land masses around is a great mechanic in this. I'm still struggling with the accelerating ending though (the first amulet could take a few turns to get, the last 3 might come all at once).

Excellent strategy game about collecting magical amulets. Players control a tribe of minions that can produce goods in three of the five terrain types on the board, providing the terrain matches the individual minion. Minions are also used to purchase amulets off the other players, with goods as the currency. When amulets reach home, the players can use their Magic to begin moving the terrain around, changing the characteristics of the playing area. First player to get all five amulets home, or four with 10 goods, or three with 20 goods, wins the game.

RATING: 6.5
This is a fun puzzle game with a cute theme, and some really unique mechanics.  It mixes a pickup and deliver game with a spatial puzzle game like Amazing Labyrinth or The Stars Are Right. The rules are not as complicated as they seem at first. It's actually fairly easy to learn how to play, although it is quite a challenging game to master.  This has me looking forward to future plays so that I can try to improve on my past performance.  There can definitely be some analysis paralysis so you might want to approach this one with caution if this frustrates you.  I've only tried it with 2 players so far.  I'd imagine it would be more difficult and cause more AP with more players but I'd still love to give it a try.

Update: In our third play with 2 players, we experienced a bit of a runaway leader problem where one player felt they had no chance to catch up.  I'm still interested to see how the dynamic changes with more players.

* Played 10+ times. I've played with 2, 3, and 4 and I think this is one of the best games ever! Artwork, theme, gameplay, tension, modular board -- this game has it all! Nice interaction between player movement, board movement, neutral movement. Quite deep. Only knock against it is that it does take a full game to get the hang of it, so you need to coach first time players thru their first game so they don't get frustrated.

JUL/13 Still a great game after all these years. It's always been overlooked which is a shame. It's still good enough to see play at my table!

This is growing on me with every play.  Very subtile puzzles in every turn with an accelerating finish which seems to come almost by surprise.  Several roads to victory and each must be carefully weighed as the opponents get a last turn when the end is triggered.  Excellent game which I may not find many opponents for but will never turn down.

Update: I played a 4 player game and I prefer this with more players.

This game is borderline buggy. One strategy seems to be to pick up many amulets at 1$ then get them all back to your tower and wait while making money. Also, the game is chaotic, since everything can move before your turn comes back. Finally, it's not involving at all, with sub-par art and a bland pasted-on theme.

This is much trickier than it looks at first glance, an interesting multiplayer abstract. 

Turns can still go quite quick and gametime is fairly short, it feels like a good meaty filler but runs a little longer than a normal filler (30 to 40 minutes or so). I see some people say it is a little short and quits when it just gets going, this is easily adjustable by tweaking the VP conditions. 

The theme is nice but the game mostly comes out dry and lacks a fun factor overall, its more of a thinkier abstract. Chaos factor might be too high with 4, 3 would probably be the right number for this but with 3 you can run into the "Attika" effect of one person needs to stop the leader. 2 players works well enough to warrant an occasional play.

A wonderful game of Wizards competing for various magical amulets by sending their tribal minions out over shifting landmasses.

I like the premise of this game and I also enjoy the way that the land tiles can shift around the board. However, the game really needs to have all players aware of what their opponents are capable of doing on their turns especially later in the game. If people don't look to hinder the leader then the game will end very quickly. The game is fun though.

A slightly fiddly game about collecting amulets around a shifting terrain. The game starts off pretty poorly with players trying to set up their creatures and I honestly thought I wasn't going to like it.

The end game though totally changed everything. Its a little bit AP-ish at the end, but  the amount of screwage and backstabbing really made the game. And it helps when you can cast more than 1 spell a turn.

Components were good, except for the really annoying bit of turning over workers which were inactive. That took up a lot of time and I look forward to finding an alternative to it.

Interesting game of manipulating tiles to create opportunities for oneself and limit opportunities for one's opponents.

Might grow a little higher with some additional plays. There is definitely more here than it looks at first, but you have to get past a rules at first that are just asking to be forgotten. Also has more theme than most Euro-ish games. If your gaming collection is not overstuffed in this area, take a look at this one!

The bits and board are wonderful but the game is broken.  In endgame everyone is on the brink of winning.  Players can then choose to advance their own position or thwart the likely winner.  The brokenness lies in the fact that the current player can advance himself, relying upon a subsequent player to stop the leader or otherwise lose.  Prone to kingmaking.

Set collection game with some fun tactics.  Goods are produced on tiles (to be collected) but production can be stopped when 5 tribesmen are on that tile.  Furthermore tiles can be shifted (for offensive and defensive purposes) and players can also choose to move neutral tribesmen to suit their needs.

A charming but rather curious little game, the best part of which is the ever-shifting playing board, an elementary but effective take on plate tectonics. It plays slowly until a point in mid-game when things suddenly start to accelerate rapidly to the end; if you're not well positioned for this noticeable change of gear you'll find yourself left hopelessly behind.

Players collect five different amulets by placing minions onto the board, using magic to shift hexes, pay for amulets and moving minions. It's a nice component game, lots of decisions and reasonably simple. However, the many decisions results in a lot of downtime while waiting for others to play and the board tends to change so that you have to wait until your turn before you start planning. With all the shifting hexes, your minions could get moved around a lot and not much of it is under your control. I have only played this with 4 players, so perhaps it plays better with 2 or 3 players.

This was hard to quantify after just one play. All of us were new to the game, and we all liked it. Looking back we obviously should have played the initial setup differently and that had a big impact on the outcome of the game. I think there should have been a "beginner's setup" included in the rules, but otherwise I really enjoyed the game.

Neat middleweight game, a little more brain-burning than many games of similar duration.  In my experience, the movement of the land tiles isn't as prominent as it would appear by looking at the game without knowing how to play it.

Delightful.  Simple rules with a bevy of possibilities in the game play makes for a fun experience.  As quick a brain-burner game as I've seen.  Can suffer when a player is playing less than optimally (either from inexperience or malevolence.)

Wow. There's a lot more to this game than the instructions suggest.  Players actually need to rely on each other to produce amulets while trying to block each other.  There are three different winning conditions, so it's actually quite challenging to determine who is winning, though the game is quite easy to play.

I had to re-learn this game on the fly, and realised that the rules are all back to front. To understand the big picture, you have to work backwards - ie you deliver stuff at the start of a turn which you've gradually worked up to acquire at the end of the previous turn. Anyway, once we got back into it, I was reminded of why I liked it - interesting options each turn, the game builds, the trickiness increases, then ends quickly. Good for 3 players.

An interesting game of movement and control that ends quickly and suddenly.  You simply move your pieces on the board in order to collect different resources but must collect them from your opponents and you can also block tiles which can also move. Very simple game but not much to it.

RATING: 7
I have a soft-spot for pick-up-and-deliver games, and Die Magier von Pangea definitely appealed to me for that reason. It uses the fun but vastly-underused mechanic of sliding tiles, which turns the process into a neat little puzzle. I liked the level of interaction in the game, with both the other real players and the neutral players--being able to buy an amulet from another player before he could buy one from you, and overloading a tile to shut down production seemed like neat strategic decisions. Allowing players to "cast a spell" on a tile to block its movement is a good concession to multi-turn planning. It's still a short game though; I wish it were a little more in-depth. Also, the game has an obvious snowball issue with the player in the lead getting more magic actions. Still, good fun.

I've only played once, however this game is so simple to learn and yet complex in strategy that it has been lingering in my thoughts since playing it. While I doubt it will be my favorite game, I feel there is a lot more to this game than one might at first think. I actually thought this game would be a little too simple for our group, but upon playing it, I was amazed at the strategy involved in actually getting what you want while other players constantly try to stop you. I definitely want to play this game more and see how it fares over time, but I believe it will be on my play list for a while and I will bring it to our gaming group for some time.

RATING: 8
Tentative rating after one play. Players *must* gang up on the leader for this one to work.

UPDATE: Raised from 7 to 8. The necessity to gang up on the leader makes this one a refreshing change from all those barely confrontational Euro games out there. Yes, there's a bit of downtime, but at least you can plan your turn while you wait; the game isn't too chaotic (unlike many Euros).

I should like this more, but I think I feel especially disappointed because it comes close to being really good.  I like games with a spatial element, a bit of chaos and a some take-that!  I think the problem is that no single move is ever very tricky, hence it is never that satisfying to pull it off, unlike say WizWar, or Master Labyrinth which are games in the same ball park.  Only at the end with the possibility of lots of spells does it get interesting.

Just played once. The game seems okay but really only seems to start in earnest after everyone has collected a couple of artifacts. Then it becomes more about spoiling other's moves than achieving victory. This first game finished early due to a first game error of judgement but the potential is there. Not outstanding but the endgame could be fun.

After one play, I hade a good time.  There was a bit too much going on for my taste, although this could easily improve with more playings.  The ease with which you can thwart others can be a boon or a bust, I suppose, depending on the people you play with and the attitude they take.  It also seemed to end a little too soon.  The aesthetics from art to bits to gameplay (e.g., the shifting board) were topnotch.

RATING: 6
I like this one, but be warned: it is a brain burner, and analysis paralysis can set in easily. You kind of have to force yourself to keep moving, or the game can bog down. That caveat aside, this is a game that relies on good tactics, is beautifully produced, has a fun theme, and is great with 2 or 3 players. We haven't played with 4 yet. With 2, it's almost like playing a puzzle with another person, and that makes it appealing to me when I'm in the proper mood. Things become a bit more free-wheeling with four players.

Great fun!  Many tough choices.  Good for people that like moving chits around a board, but still want a euro feel.  Not much direct conflict, but a massive amount of indirect conflict.  Mostly I can't attack you, but I can really throw a monkey wrench in your plans. The pieces are great and the wrap around board really add to the spacial elements of this game.  I love it.

Played 3+ times. This game is pretty fun.  There's definitely a screw the leader element, but that just means be in second.  It seems to end when you can't screw everyone and you get a kingmaker situation.  I'm not sure if this is a bad thing or not.  I find the games plays best with 3, and you really have to be on the ball.  Not so great with two, because of leader run-away. 2004/06/19

A bit of an abstracty brain burner but that's not always a bad thing. Thing is the theme really helped me stay in this game and made it not feel as long as it was. That's a good thing every time! I enjoy enjoying games. I also like that there are always options of things to do. Yes there definitely seems to be a "right" thing to do each time but sometimes which one is more right? :) A good game and I really would like to see how it is with a full load of 4 players.

RATING: 7.5
It may not look much (although game components are generally clean and sturdy), but this is really a very nice game. I only played it about five times so far, but the game's length (a little more than an hour) and the high level of player interaction make for interesting and easy play. Also one of the most original games I played in a long time.
UPDATE: Rating is based on 3-player games. A 4-player game is less tight, as the board tends to become cluttered, one neutral tribe less means less control, and it's much harder to avoid aiding other players unintended. Rating for 4 players is therefore 6.5 (one point less).

A forgotten early Euro-

Maybe not such a bad thing as it's a blah little pick up and deliver game with serious runaway leader problems. Initial placement and random tile draws can heavily favor some players over others. There are numerous other issues as well. 

Despite this, the game has its charms. The shifting map is a great mechanic, one I'd like to see more often. All in all there are a bunch of great ideas here, ones that never got taken farther...

When explained the rules, I naturally dug it, as I'm a big fan of games with a spatial element.

First 3/4 of the game is great...then the game disintegrates into hurting the people who look as though they're going to win rather than attempting to help yourself.  So the endgame drags out, and you're hoping that others don't see what you do by the time it gets back to your turn.  This, to me, completely ruins the game.

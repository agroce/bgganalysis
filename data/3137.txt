RATING: 5.5
An extremely light and fun game, where you must be able to order chronologically some (rather obscure) events, as well as bluff and/or read other player's bluffing.
Can be fun with the right crowd.

One of the best trivia and bluffing games out there. Often you don't need to know the exact facts - it may be sufficient to persuade you neighbor.

RATING: 9
Ideal filler or starter if you are waiting for players to arrive (easy to adjust the playing time). Great game, unique idea, rules explained in 1 minute. One of the best knowledge / guessing games. Great to mix several editions, e.g. Entdecker, Life Style, Natur.

Not really a game, but a fun way to waste some time. For a party game it doesn´t offer enough.

RATING: 4
The fun really depends on whether or not you're into the subject, i enjoyed playing Sex & Crime & loathed Inventions.. so if you like casual games with an educational approach make sure you pick a topic that you're interested in.

Diese Wertung steht für die gesamte Anno Domini-Reihe.
Ein wirklich guter Filler oder Spiel für zwischendurch. Auch mit weniger Allgemeinwissen hat man Chancen, da einige der Ereignisse völlig abstrus sind und daher schwer einzuordnen. Für Menschen die ein bierernstes Wissensspiel erwarten isses ehr nix, dafür hängt das Spiel zusehr vom Kartenglück und Nebensitzern ab.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit. Great for finding the Rain Man in your social group.

Anno Domini is one of the very few games my wife also likes to play. So thats the very main reason I own a couple of it. I also think its fun, but the fun begins when you play with at least four players (five or six are even better). You should also make sure that you don't have an "expert" in the round (played the Natur topic two times with a biologist teacher... no fun! ;o) ).

(Listing every "expansion" of Anno Domini as a seperate game is a bit much ... don't you think? I only mark this as owned, but have several others.) 

Great game. At first you think, that the one player with the history major will dominate it, but this game is not about knowledge. It is about bluffing and tactics.

RATING: 6.5
Simpatico filler (a volte non così veloce). Regole elementari che si spiegano in 2 minuti. Se la materia piace il gioco appassionerà e divertirà, la conoscenza è solo una delle doti richieste ai giocatori, avere un po' di faccia tosta e sangue freddo conta anche di più. Tra le varie espansioni Sotto i Riflettori è la mia preferita con domande spesso difficile sul mondo del cinema ma anche sul teatro. Sport e Svago è maggiormente incentrata sull'ultimo secolo e particolarmente sul calcio anche se molte domande sono veramente nozionistiche. Mentre Invenzioni e Scoperte è forse l'edizioni che meno mi ha colpito perché ha troppi eventi del tipo buttiamola a caso. In italiano esistono anche le edizioni Penne e Pennelli e Avvenimenti Bizzarri che non ho ancora provato, mentre innumerevoli sono le edizioni in tedesco. Aspetto del gioco che purtroppo trascuro spesso è quello di leggere le spiegazioni sul retro delle carte che raccontano alcune curiosità, il più delle volte mi limito a guardare l'anno e basta.

Great Twist on general trivia game and very enjoyable that like a good banter and discussion and have a general interest in fun trivia and history (or inventions that is). The mechanics are bit unpolished, especially the winning conditions, then again, that is not what this game is about, better keep it simple. Lovely stuff.

If you can find a topic that you're interested in then these are a terrific set of games. More of an educational exercise or family game to play with the grandparents than an entertaining game. If you're interested in a certain topic though then I can recommend trying one of these out. Generally I have a low desire to play any one topic over and over again, but the Erfindungen set is a good generalised topic that works well as a stand alone. Single topics work well with certain groups, and with 336 cards per set I don't mind them separated into topics.

Can be a fun game with the right group of players. Very simple to explain and get up and running - you're placing cards based upon their chronological order, trying to get rid of your hand. As the timeline grows it becomes increasingly harder to find the right gap for cards you have remaining. I enjoy it with family, but my rating is based upon my feeling of its general reception with gamers and how I feel about playing with them. Of all the topic specific decks I like the broad Deutschland one the best... or maybe the VIP set... or the Europa Set... or... Hmm. I'd like it if they came out with a good pick of mixed topic cards for a more diversified game so I could own just one set, but that wouldn't be a good business decision.

At least, compared to the Timeline series, you get a decent number of cards in a set. With 336 cards per set you're not going to get too bored of the same questions too quickly.

Die Anno Domini Spiele sind nett für zwischendurch. Es geht grob darum, (in diesem Fall) Erfindungen nach dem Jahr zu ordnen.

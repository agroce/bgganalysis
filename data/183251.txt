LIKE: Very quick game, a fun puzzle. I enjoyed how limiting the tiles were, but yet you could hope a very specific tile comes out soon.
DISLIKE: Very light. People could copy each other, reducing the fun factor.

OVERALL: I liked it as a quick puzzle game, very clever idea. I think it'd be great for light gamers and even children. I wish there was a way to randomize opening setup just a little.

I am not quite sure about the symmetry in the flow of play. Everyone plays the exact same board. I understand that now all players are basically solving the same puzzle and thus the everyone has an equal opportunity to win. However, this easily leads to players mirroring each other's moves. Moreover, for a family game this is not always a good quality in a family game since it always the best player who wins. How long can you expect your family to be interested if you beat them every time, and I reckon it is not fun for you to play poorly either.

Nevertheless, Karuba is an enjoyable boardgame. Just make sure you play a few moves without looking at other players' boards to ensure asymmetry.

I really enjoy playing this with my kids. It certainly lends for specific strategies to be repeated but It still have some variation  due to order of tiles pulled and just straight luck. I especially appreciate that I can play this with my 6 and 7 yo kids and not feel as if my brain was turning into mush. Takeaway: if you are tired of pretending that you lost or were fooled at "tic-tac-toe" than you need this game.

Very simple tile-pathing game with a bingo mechanic.  Good choices and racing element.  Strangely little randomization...all players may do something very similar or even the same.  This seems like a poor design choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.04
Love this.  I think the mechanics meld perfectly, and knowing everybody's playing the same tiles in the same order still leaves room for a gamble or two, while the race for higher-point results keeps it from being purely solitaire.

RATING: 6
1st plays: This was fun, trying to build the routes vs balancing getting gems and when to move. The order of the tiles can be really rough, or really smooth which makes it unpredictable. Really a simple game, light and easy to play and talk while playing.

2nd play: Played with the kids, and while they were initially reluctant they had fun. Picking up treasures and laying down paths is fun for anyone. It was a close game and the kids picked up on the concepts early. I can see why it was nominated for Spiel, it's very accessible.

Karuba is the ultimate in multi-player solitaire. No, wait: I can't call it "solitaire": Solitaire is a game, while Karuba is a puzzle. A good puzzle, sure, but definitely not a game. Well, you might just want to play it for the deep, engaging theme. No, wait: there is no theme!

RATING: 7
Think Bingo, where the called-out numbers correspond to tiles you use to form a path through the jungle, connecting your explorers to temples that need plundering. A quick and simple game, and although there's not much to it, it's surprisingly compelling. Definitely would make a great family or children's game, but I'd happily bring it out as a quick filler for gamers who don't mind a heavy dose of luck and fortune. Doesn't overstay its welcome. Multi-player solitaire: there's no interaction whatsoever beyond the race to see who plunders their temples first.

Very cute game and easy to pick up.  However, here's my main beef with it:  you could play this by yourself.  It's just bingo, call a  number and place a tile.  Really no interaction and I noticed that while my group played this game, no one talked.  If that's the experience you want, this is a good game.  However, it doesn't facilitate conversation, which to me is the heart and soul of gaming.

RATING: 7
Clever, pleasant mutual-masturbation game (every player has his own board, no real interaction) where everyone has the same setup and gets the same tile each turn. It sounds weak, I know, but the sequence of the drawn tiles, the bonus VPs on some of them, the way your paths come to fruition and the choices you make along the way all coalesce into a surprisingly enjoyable experience. (The simultaneous play aspect seems a bit odd, though, and might lead to "accidental" cheating.)

Neat in that it's effectively contract Bridge: everyone has the same stuff, there is no luck, and yet you'll all have radically different outcomes.

Another of HABA's new family weight games, and quite a good one, almost like 'Bingo' meets 'Incan Gold'. Some variation in how players choose to place the Temples and Adventurers on their islands, and good decision making when you've gotta decide to discard a tile for movement or wait and place it. Light but thinky, a design that would appeal to a great many people, casual or gamer.

Very light and enjoyable family game, even my little girls (7 and 5) can play in a reasonable manner.
It is a kind of bingo variant, where a player draws a numbered tile and all others search for the same tile, then everyone puts it where they like.
Everyone has its own board, and the goal is to create paths to temples (harvesting gold and gems in the jungle).
Nothing new or too fancy, but everything is very smooth, fast and enticing.

This is good and can be a lot of fun.  I know it's for younger audiences, but is a nice diversion for adult audiences as well.  I do feel like it caters very much to more lateral thinkers, but if you don't stress out about winning, you can have a fun time trying to "solve" the particular session.  But once you get the logic of the game, there are points in a single game you kind of end up realizing that the game is already over without it being over, and you just have to go through the motions.  But it has a pleasant puzzly feel that is quite enjoyable.

This is like Bingo for boardgamers. A solitary experience but I like the puzzle that Karuba offers. It's light...you can teach the game in 2 minutes and play in 15...but I consider that a plus. I can see replayability becoming an issue though. While the temple/explorer positions vary and the tiles come out differently, I find that I build my paths using the same general thought process each time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Amazingly simple, interesting and FUN tile layer. Everyone has the same board layout, but might lay their paths in differing ways. Deciding whether to charge to temples or stop and get treasure along the way is a great compliment to the larger challenge of how to most efficiently forge your path through the jungle. Just an amazing tile laying game.

'Bingo' style Carcassonne combined with some racing elements. Very lightweight and -hearted, so it can be played and enjoyed with probably anyone. The only negative thing I can say about it is that, besides its low weight which will keep it from being played repeatedly over a longer period, the setup can be a little bit of a chore, as you have to seperate all the tiles. Otherwise a very well crafted and smooth family style game.

Karuba is a tile laying game that is reminiscent of carcassonne, but where everyone has their own board. You are trying to get explorers to their matching temples by laying tiles on your board. Everyone is laying the same tile at the same time, but can and will lay it in different places.

Very simple to play and fun for the whole family. If you want carcassonne without the frustration of someone stealing your route or hedging in on your town, check this one out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Karuba tries to be a bit of evertything but doesn’t shine at anything: it’s just a solipsist puzzle you need to solve on your own, without any interference by or interaction with any other player, the one exception being reaching the temples before your opponents in order to grab a modest point reward.

Although light and quick, it’s a game I would play again only if everyone else wants to but never suggest: there are many meaty fillers that hold the same spot and are also fun to play.

Much much lighter than my typical game fare, but I can see the appeal of this game as a fast playing, family friendly game. The random order of tiles will create a new puzzle with each play and I can easily see this getting to the table with non-gamers or family members. This isn't something I would choose to play, but if you are looking for a family friendly and enjoyable game I think this could fit the bill.

Excellent game, very worth the Spiel nomination even though I believe Imhotep and Codenames will be played more over the next few years in our group. Component quality is excellent, as is typical with HABA. Only minor downside is lack of significant player interaction, as it feels like a game that could be largely figured out over time and then put away. Also very punishing when players with even minimal experience play against those with none. Still well worth the first few plays.

Karuba... I'm not completely sold on this game I think that I'll either love or hate this game on the second play through. Unfortunately none of my group felt like resorting their components for a second play. There seems to be quite a bit of strategy to this game but I felt it was pretty hard to wrap my head around at first. The game hinges on deciding when to discard tiles to move versus playing them on your board as paths. Really need to get this one to the table again, even if the setup is rather fiddly.

Very pleasant. A nicely implemented tile laying game reminiscent of Take It Easy but with a bit more to it and an attractive theme. Like TIE the system of blind draw and then everyone place the same tile soon produces very different approaches to the same problem and drives the game on at a good pace, making this an excellent filler or closer.

I usually like Rüdiger Dorn's games, but this seems pretty derivative for him. It's basically Take it Easy/To the Limit/Higher, except not as interesting in several key ways, but with better and more engaging chrome. If the exploration theme with just a touch of narrative is important to you, this may appeal, but as a game it's demonstrably inferior to the "Take It ..." games.

A good entry into the multi-player solitaire puzzle solving genre. Everyone starts with the same puzzle to solve, and places the same pieces in the same order. So, games like these are just a matter of if you play those pieces more wisely than the other players or not.

This one adds a movement mechanic on top of the pretty standard tile laying mechanic, which is kind of neat, introducing a race element to the game.

Overall, if you like this genre of game, you'll like this, and if you don't like this genre, you probably won't. I'm in the camp that enjoys them.

This is a neat little German family game style Euro with some solid strategy but inviting ruleset.  I dig the laying of tiles to connect point A to point B spatially with a nuance of choosing what tiles you can afford to discard.  Just a hint of pressure there as the game is winding down which makes it thoughtful, exciting, yet very approachable.

I think this game has a dominant strategy, and it is just about luck--who put the right pieces in the right place by accident (because you never know what is coming up next).

Still, there is a place for these games and it is entertaining. And offers hard choices.

Only played once, and halfway through thought, "I'm either really gonna like this, or really gonna hate this", but we ended-up not paying entirely correctly (we ignored the special scoring tiles), plus, I won, and I always hesitate to give a game a positive review after winning the first time I play.

Light tile laying game, tailored to families. Non confrontational multiplayer solitaire, with nice art and components. There is an element of timing that makes you pay attention to your fellow players, and I guess one could play the probabilities based on the remaining tiles. Has a definite problem with people waiting to see what each other will do at crucial scoring points. Overall though, the game felt it has nothing new to offer. Middle of the pack for its genre..

This reminds me a lot of FITS in that you've got a single selected pattern and all players then decide what to do with it on their own boards. But then this game ups the tension by having you decide when to sacrifice the tile to move your pawns ahead, and when you want to stop to collect valuable gems.

It was a satisfying puzzle and I really didn't know right up until the end who was ahead. Great pacing and components - I think I need this one in our collection real soon.

Je pense que c'est un de mes coups de cœur. Ce jeu fait partie de la nouvelle collection HABA, orientée famille. C'est un jeu simple, esthétiquement plutôt joli, avec un mécanisme de pose de tuiles pour aller chercher des trésors. La bonne idée est qu'on a tous un plateau identique, on va poser les mêmes tuiles, qui seront sélectionnées façon Bingo, mais forcement, on va les poser de manière différentes. Peu d'interaction entre les joueurs (donc on ne peut pas se pourrir les uns-les autres), mais cela reste dynamique car on joue tous en même temps.

"Je tire la tuile 38, tout le monde prend cette tuile" 
"Mais elle est toute moisie, ta tuile ! Elle ne m'arrange pas du tout "  --> Vous entendrez cette phrase lors de vos parties, c'est O-BLI-GA-TOIRE

Bingo-inspired tile-laying race game. Everyone has the same board, tiles and meeples. One person draws a tile face down and calls out its number. Everyone else finds that tile of theirs and each chooses where to place it on their own board. The tiles have roads of differing intersections on them that will create a path for the meeples to move through the jungle and reach the treasure. Most points wins.

A pathing game with a race element (in the sense that the first to get their paths efficiently built will win).  I like that you have an interesting decision with each tile draw - place it, or use it to move.   There is enough tension from the race element.   On the downside, however, the game is fatally flawed in that there is absolutely nothing to prevent all players from making the same choice.   You can just copy your neighbor, literally.   That's not a good trait for a puzzle game.   It almost seems like there should be one blocked space on each player board, sort of like Factory Fun.

Don't think this will replace Don Quixote for me, which has a similar feel.

Érdekes látni, ahogyan ugyanazokat a lapkákat felhasználva minden játékos más-más "ösvény-hálózatot" épít. Aki nem figyel oda, könnyen úgy járhat, hogy elzárja az útját valamelyik kalandorának, aki így képtelen lesz eljutni a saját színének megfelelő templomba. Ha már ez kiderült, akkor még nem kell feladni, mert értékes győzelmi pontokat szerezhet a kristályokból és aranyrögökből, csak a megfelelő helyre kell lerakni ezeket a lapkákat. A szüleimmel játszottuk a játékot, könnyedén összekeverték a kalandorok (tengerpart) és a templomok (dzsungel) elhelyezését, de ezen kívül simán tudtak játszani a játékkal. Szerencsére nincs túl sok szabály, így hamar el lehet kezdeni a játékot, a leghosszabb időt az jelenti, mire a játékosok számsorrendbe elhelyezik a lapkákat a saját tábla körül. Három játékos esetén érdemes a templomokba elsőként érkezni, mert elég sok pont (5) jár érte. Könnyű családi játék, amit bármikor elő lehet venni egy kis versenyfutással egybekötött úthálózat építésre. Minden családnak ajánlott! (2017.01.15)

Haba have made their first foray from kids games into the family gaming market with three family games launched at Essen 2015. And if Karuba is anything to go by this is a welcome diversion for this great German publisher. 

Karuba has been a huge hit with the family, a massive hit. And let’s set the stall out here: my family are not natural gamers and yet my kids and my wife have requested this repeatedly.

The game consists of everyone building their own map on their grid and based on taking exactly the same path tiles (drawn ‘Take It Easy’ style). Each palyer is trying to build a network of paths that allows them to move their adventurer along the paths to their goals. The movement is clever: you can sacrifice a tile in order to move your adventurer. 

Whilst this all sounds a little solitairish, and it is in many respects, the game also takes on this feeling of being a race to the temples, as you all have identical targets to reach. So you have the tension of the race along with the enjoyable puzzley placement of tiles.

All in all excellent fun and I am looking forward to trying Haba’s other games in the range.

RATING: 6
Karuba is a simultaneous tile laying and route building game. All players use the same set of tiles and will play the identical selected tile via a bingo-esque mechanism. Players each have paired colours of 4 temples and 4 explorers. They are on identical locations on each player's board. Each round a tile's number will be called and players will try to use it. They will either lay it on their board to try and make a path that connects the explorer to its matching temple or discard the tile for movement of the explorers. Tiles played can't be rotated. So, the order of the tiles will matter. It's a race to reach the temples to score the most points. Some of the tiles will lay gems on their path which are also worth points. It's a quick game, really easy game to explain, and great for families or as gamer filler. It may get a little boring for gamers if it's played often and especially if you don't include the promo tiles. Better than expected.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I had high hopes for this Spiel des Jahre winner, but it did not deliver. The hook is interesting; every player is given the exact same stream of tiles, but each will use them differently. Unfortunately, this core does not yield any interesting gameplay. Each player more or less completes their own puzzle, while occasionally finding themselves in a race with another opponent. The acquisition of crystals and gold occasionally mixes up the decision making process, but generally players are focused on reaching the temples. And given the nature of the game, each player is likely to achieve similar results, which makes a player's decisions seem less impactful. Simply put, the game fails to generate high stakes, which limits player engagement and enjoyment.

This is a tile-laying race game with players starting with boards that are identical, and one player drawing tiles that they all will use. They race to get their explorers to temples first and earn points. Along the way they can collect additional points by collecting items off the paths they create.

Description from the English Ruleset:

Many moons have come and gone since your boats departed on the journey to Karuba. Once you arrive on the island, each player will lead an expedition team of four adventurers. Now you just have to navigate your way through the dense jungle to make it to the temples. „Just“ may be something of an understatement; the ancient jungle trails have to be found and uncovered first! Hurry up and be the first to reach the temples to collect the most valuable treasures. Many paths have dead ends and you need to be patient to find the right/best way (through the jungle). Look! A gold nugget! You can pick it up and collect it, same applies to the shiny crystals along the paths.

A nice and quite fun light, multiplayer solitaire, kind of abstract puzzle tile placement race game with gorgeous artwork.

:arrowN:Better Than: Don Quixote, Alhambra, Taluva
:arrowE:On Par With: Tsuro, Micropul, Qin, This Town Ain't Big Enough For The 2-4 Of Us
:arrowS:Not Better Than: Ingenious, Qwirkle, Seeland, Takenoko

Tile Placement is my favourite game mechanism and it is well represented in my collection. I don't know that Karuba can eject one of my favourites at this time. As a "Johnny Come Lately" the bar is already set quite high and justification of shelf space has become a real concern. Perhaps if it had entered the collection earlier it would have been a keeper...As it is, it has fallen into the "Nice to have, but not essential" category.

Punching caution with the 6 square tile boards: As careful as I was, having punched out hundreds of games, still damaged some tiles.  Across the bottom of the boards, HABA is printed.  The worst damage occurred across the top-most row, on the opposite side of green.  Also had some slight problems on the same side with other tiles.  I recommend punching from the green side carefully, and trimming with scissors when necessary.  I own many of the high-quality HABA games with great components, so was surprised with this punching problem.  Components-wise, this game is 5 on a scale of 10, for me.

This is a very nice family game.  Quick to teach, easy to remember rules, plays in half an hour.  Delightful.

Nagyon egyszerű, ám mégis nagyon egyedi mechanizmus. Mindenki kikeresi ugyanazt a véletlenszerűen kiválasztott lapkát, majd felteszi a táblára valahova, vagy eldobja és lép az egyik kincsvadásszal. A cél, eljuttatni a kincsvadászokat a templomokba és közben meg-megállva kristályokat és aranyat gyűjteni.

RATING: 5
A solitary tile-layer somewhat similar to Take it Easy but with a theme added on and a noticably different focus. The actual tile placement is much more lenient (and much less relevant for scoring purposes), but there is a tradeoff to make between placing tiles and moving your adventurers through the jungle created that way in order to be faster than the competition. I suppose that technically increases the interaction somewhat but its dosage is still rather homeopathic.

IMO this is to be played mainly by/with kids between 7 - 12 years or so. There is no interaction between the players and the puzzle to be solved is fairly straightforward. All of this plus the nice drawings and fun theme makes it a good game for kids. But it is not something I personally would like to play again.

A game you introduce to people and they want to play again immediately. Played with my wife's parents and ended up playing 4 in a row. And the box lies. Game only takes 15-20 minutes to play. 

It's certainly on the simple side for my taste, yet has just enough going on that I still feel like I've actually played a game afterwards, a big deal for me. Excellent!

A very original puzzle game from Haba! The players will be traiblazing through a jungle, picking up crystals and gold on the way to forgotten temples. The islands start the same but each player builds the paths their own way, lead by a very ingenious bingo-like system where one of the players shuffles their tiles and draws them one by one. The thing that makes the choices that much tougher is that it's a race! Whoever gets to the temples first also gets the biggest reward, and you can discard a piece instead of placing it to get your explorers to move.

A tile-laying game of trying to get your adventurers to their respective temples, picking up gems along the way.

The only downside to Karuba is the time it takes to set up.  That being said, it plays as a cool casual game to play with friends, or a great game to introduce children to deeper strategies in board gaming.  Everyone starts out with the same board setup and plays the same tiles each turn, but by the end, each person has created their very own unique landscape before them.  If you like puzzles or mazes, this is a cool and easy must have for children or adults that don't want to stress out.

Most fun bingo-variant I've played so far.
Someone calls out a tile and everyone uses that tile. A tile can be either placed in your personal tableau or discarded to move an explorer closer to the temple. The goal is to get your explorers to the temples quickly to score the highest-valued treasures and to collect gold and gems along the way for additional points.

This game feels like playing Bingo. Someone calls out a number, search for the corresponding tile, create path for your explorer to move to the treasure.

This is almost the epitome of multiplayer solitaire. Other than a very slight incentive to accomplish certain things before your opponents there isn't really a reason for anyone else to be there.

But that said the puzzle is fairly interesting while also being very accessible. You have to have some idea where you're going while remaining flexible since you don't know how the tiles are going to come out. Overall an entertaining game to pull out now and then but not something to get too excited about.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (June 2016)

As soon I heard Karuba was a 2016 Spiel des Jahres Nominee, my desire to play it plummeted. Historically, I don’t enjoy much the games they choose for their award. A friend made me play it and I was right. Karuba is not for me. 

The rules of the game are very easy to learn and teach. You can do it under 8 minutes. Playtime is also short, it is around 25 minutes.

The theme is ok, it doesn’t bother me but it doesn’t excite me either.

The game components are very well done and they look gorgeous on the table In general, production values are very high.

I really like that each player plays has to choose the same tile to play each turn, that is, the game is very fair. However, the decisions needed to play Karuba are very light and obvious. There is some strategy to the game, but it doesn’t satisfy me, Karuba is a light game. It doesn’t have any kind of interaction (which doesn’t particularly bother me). In some occasions, a screen would have been great to have as it would have assured each player played on his own and not seeing what other players are doing, perhaps even copying their moves.

Bottom line, I recognize Karuba IS a good family/casual game, but it is not for us. I don’t like most tile laying games and Karuba is way too light for our current tastes. I won’t buy it and I will do my best to stay away from it. Cute game but way overhyped.

Fun, quick, easy-to-teach family game. As randomly selected tiles are called, each player has to build four pathways connecting his adventurer to his or her corresponding temple and move the adventurer to that temple to score. This game is puzzly, involves a fair bit of spatial reasoning and planing. While there is a multi-player solitaire feeling to it at times, you do have to concentrate on what other players are doing so that you reach the temples first to score the most points.  I keep coming back to this one.  It is always a hit no matter what group it is played with.  Enough strategy for a gamer but you can get started with new players in less than 10 minutes! A definite hit, and worthy Spiel des Jahres nominee.

Brilliant, quick, and fun game! It actually has a good number of interesting decision points, despite a fairly decent luck element. Personally, I am very happy with this luck aspect in a game that lasts only 20 minutes.

I love Haba, so maybe I'm biased, but Karuba is an excellent game.  To have all players start out the same, with the same goals and the same ways to reach those goals and then see how everyone goes about creating their paths is simply amazing to me.  The game's almost like Bingo, but you're creating your Bingo board as you play.  I love it, I really do.  I haven't been this enamored by a game in awhile.  This one really takes the cake.

The good news is that the whole family liked it. The bad news is that both me and my wife have doubts about how many times we could play it before becoming bored. We'll certainly be bringing it out more at the kids' behest and see how it goes. If our enjoyment sustains, I could up this a point.

I can best describe this game as "path-building bingo". Every player starts with an identical set of tiles and a player board with 4 identical adventurer start and end points (every board has 4 adventurers and each has a unique end point of a matching color). The start and end points change from game to game, but are the same for every player each game. One player shuffles their stack of tiles and every turn draws one and calls out the number on it. Each player then finds that tile and either places it anywhere on their board to build paths for their adventurers or discards it to move an adventurer a number of spaces equal to the number of path exits on the tile (2-4). Treasures await at the end points, but some tiles have crystals and gold that adventurers can stop to pick up. There is no requirement for any adventurers to reach end points. The game is just a point grab. Whomever has the most points in treasures, gold and crystals when the tiles run out wins the game.

Conceptually, it is pretty cool how different paths and scores can be given that everyone starts with an identical board and identical tiles. Ultimately, though, I fear the limited objectives and repetitive play choices will grow a bit stale. Fun... for now.

Terrific tile laying game. Taught successfully to my 7 and 9 year-olds in less than 5 mins. Fun enough that my wife and I will play two player games when kids are in bed. Great family fun. Highly recommended.

One year later: Still love the game. One criticism- It may be that building a path around the perimeter of the board beats building "through the jungle" every time. Discovered that using the volcano promo- and allowing it to be placed on perimeter of board, mitigates the problem.

The rules to Karuba are simple. Each player has an identical set of numbered tiles, and a 5 by 6 square grid to place them on. One player randomly stacks her tiles and each turn draws one, all other players find that tile in their supply and add it to their board. So each round every player adds the same tile to their board. The goal is to connect each of four different coloured meeples to their respective temples.

You can either add a new tile to your board or discard it for movement points equal to the number of edges that have a path entrance. The first to get a meeple to its temple gets 5 points the next 4 points and so on.

You might think that player's boards would look very similar due to placing the same tile each round, but people quickly diverge from one another. It's very interesting to see how the different boards evolve. When you lose you have no one but yourself to blame, you could have done exactly what the winning player had done.

The game is very light, but not without some fun decision making. There isn't much in the way of interaction, but for a 30 minute game I have no complaints. I love how players will collectively bemoan the tile draws, it gives the game an air of cooperation (or at least shared suffering) which is nice in a light family game.

Thematic bingo variant. Take It Easy in the jungle. Players have to run their adventurers to temples before others arrive and collect silver and gold on the way.

One of my favorite gateway games. You need to reach these temples to get treasure everyone gets that. Everyone also knows the bingo mechanic. So this makes the game so accessible to any people. I play this with my gamer friends, with my mom, with casuals and it always is a blast. Can not recommend it more. Rüdiger Dorn really designs games that I absolutely love.

Szinte teljesen pasziánsz jellegű játék minimális interakcióval (kb. annyi, hogy ki ér el előtt egyik helyről a másikra). Mégis... Nagyon hangulatos, nagyon szórakoztató, az egyszerű szabályok mellett bőven van döntési lehetőség. Bár nem vagyok nagy háziszabály hívő, itt úgy érzem, hogy akár lehet is alkalmazni néhányat. Pl. , hogy mégis lehessen forgatni a lapkákat (egy kis könnyítés), vagy hogy felváltva lehessen meghatározni, melyik lapka legyen a következő (talán nagyobb stratégiát, illetve több interakciót lehet ezzel becsempészni). De félreértés ne essék, az alapszabályok változtatása nélkül is ez egy KIVÁLÓ játék.

With identical setup for all players, Karuba is simply a test of who can build their paths (and move) more efficiently. Love the ability to score by either racing to the temples or hanging back to grab gems.

Family fun, but with enough depth that it keeps it interesting.  Bingo style calling out of pieces and within a few simple turns everyone's boards are completely different.  The best of the Habba Family games so far.

We hate bingo.  We do like tile placement games on average but many don't remain interesting for very long.  Karuba is a nice exception to both.  I like this game enough I'd buy it even if I didn't play with family or kids.  I do enjoy spatial puzzles and this one adds plenty to just that mechanic.  You know you only have so much time and balancing placing tiles with discarding them in order to move meeples so that simple decision is VERY critical.  On top of that is balancing multiple path-finding of 4 meeples to 4 different destinations across similar paths but also with the goal of not just picking up gems, but doing so without wasting movement cycles.  It's exactly the type of game you apply words like Clever, Brilliant, Charming, etc. to!
I've heard a few complain about the initial setup and what I do is different than I'd initially seen.  I set out the pieces in rows of 10 such that 24 is below 14 which is below 4.  In that way I just grab tiles and quickly put them into approx. the right place easily correcting placement slightly as I get further.  The whole thing takes so little time that way that I've been known to sort several others tiles as well.  Considering many games with complex card sorting or pre-game shuffling I've never seen this as a deterrent to playing Karuba.
I could even see giving this game a 10 after playing it even more.

Excellent puzzle game with everyone starting with the same layout. On your turn you either place down a tile or discard it for movement. Tile laying is very easy, making sure the number is always in the upper left, and movement is just as easy to calculate. The whole family can enjoy this one. It plays fairly quickly too.

+ Easy to learn
+ Fast play

- compared to it's weight and duration the setup is a bit fiddly/long.
- The one pulling the tiles has no clean overview on what is still out there. Requires a playeraid, clean visual on another players unused tiles or good knowledge and memory to do well.

A true family game oddly enough my wife likes this one more than my son does. 

At first glance it seems puzzly but it's actualy the race and efficiency while moving that makes the game play worthy.

This is a tile-laying race game with players starting with boards that are identical, and one player drawing tiles that they all will use.

Rüdiger Dorn's ([geeklist=196593]ahem[/geeklist]) take on the multiplayer solitaire genre Knizia has designed lots of games for ([geeklist=140828]Take it Easy!-like games[/geeklist]) is somewhat thematic and quite fun. Also, the 'race' elements adds a little interesting element to the mix. With the trerasure hunter theme added it's winner for families; still it's too much like the games mentioned so in the end it does not feel as unique or special as others who have not played those games claim it to be.

This game is probably my family's #1 game. It's just so satisfying building those paths through the jungle, even if you don't win. After several dozen games, it definitely starts feeling a little samey-samey, so it tends to spend more time in the closet than it used to, but it's still one everyone wants to play.

Strategic bingo, but in a more interesting way than Rise of Augustus, and arguably more true to actual bingo, as while there isn't any spatial tactics in bingo there is still a spatial feel. I was surprised how different each person's board can get considering we are getting all the tiles in the same order, and despite its simple ruleset there is definitely a lot of forward planning of where to place tiles involved.

Overhyped. The SdJ-nomination is a joke. It's basically multiplayer solitaire with no interaction whatswhoever, plus the inherent ability to cheat (with being able to look at other players boards and their placement). A screen for everyone would have been absolutely mandatory here. In the end, it's also just ugly(!) tile laying with a completely pasted-on theme. Connect the farmer to their lost cattle or the little lamb to their heird...would have worked equally fine, 100%. All in all there is nothing great to find here, aside from the little downtime - Karuba is a hard pass for me.

Update 3/20/16: 

I loved this game the first few times I played it. But after playing it again tonight (3 player), I noticed something I hadn't noticed as much before. That is, this game is really really luck-driven. I knew the "bingo" element existed. However, I wasn't quite prepared for how little probability can be factored into decision making. As a gamer who weighs odds in most games, this one, because of the randomness of the tile pulls, cannot be consistently won by taking ostensibly "safe" bets. I still really like it. But it's a bit disappointing that a game can majorly stall out because of luck and this last game left me cold. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
FUN: very easy to explain and plays very quickly, but still offers a nice little challenge.

I hate Karuba because it makes me realize I could never be a proficient board game designer. It is so simple and so elegant, it feels like the game should have always existed.

Karuba is everything a SdJ nominee/winner should be. Accessible to kids, fun for non-gamer adults, and strategic enough for gamers. Three minutes to explain, twenty minutes to play. The puzzle aspect makes you want to have another go at it right away to see if you can get a higher score.

I would be shocked if it doesn't win. Imhotep may be a bit too cutthroat and too dry/mathy for families and Codenames is more of a party game for adults.

Carcassone + bingo? Somehow, it works, despite all the reasons it really shouldn't. Normally, multiplayer solitaire games are a turn-off, but knowing that it's symmetric mps and racing against opponents who may have made better or worse decisions than you can be quite thrilling.

I would recommend using an extra set of tiles (if not playing with all of them) or getting a set of bingo numbers and a bag since the expedition leader role can be a bit annoying when trying to determine when and where to push your luck on using a tile or cashing it in for movement.

The best use of the bingo mechanic i've seen in a board game. Every player has their own set of carcassonne type road tiles but one player draws one of his from a bag but whatever it is everyone else has to place on their own board but anywhere they want in order to fill in their own maze which will hopefully lead your 4 adventurers to their 4 temples faster than the other players for gems and victory points! Superb family game.

Can implement the "Add-On" using a deck of cards numbered 1-36 with 4 "?" cards.  Players take turns drawing a card to determine the tile number.  If a player pulls a "?" they get to choose the tile number that everyone plays.  If that tile number comes up later, redraw a new card/number.

Very nice! A cool variant of Take It Easy, with a lot more flavour in it. Choosing when to build and when to run is a nice touch. Feels a bit easy, though, which may hinder the lasting appeal. Still, a solid family game.

The game is pretty simple and fast... 1 tile is drawn and you have to decide where to place that tile on your board to create a path for your Explorers to move on OR discard that tile and move ONE Explorer up to the same number of spaces has rad exits that tile had (2 to 4, but you can move only 1 space if you want). And that's it!

It's very simple and fast with a lot of good decisions to be made...

Like it a lot!

Great game for what it is.
There is little-to-none player interaction, it's just the idea of "prove you're the best in solving a puzzle, which is guaranteed to be completely the same for everyone". But boy is that a funny puzzle.

I'd definitely recommend the PnP add-on "Karuba bonus tiles".

Imádom!! Fantasztikus kivitelezés, remek hangulat, egyszerű szabályok, pörgős játékmenet, érdekes döntések, egyenlő esélyek, és kellő kihívás.
Számomra nagyon szórakoztató, a lapkák kiválasztását egy app végzi helyettem, hogy még kevesebb feladatom legyen.. A játék végén a másik útvonalán nagyokat lehet ámulni, vagy épp jókat szórakozni. :)
És akkor az egyetlen (de elég nagy) negatívum: a felpakolás.. fú de rühellem. Igaziból össze vissza is lehetnek a lapok, de akkor játék közben kell keresgélni, ami még idegesítőbb. Ez a játék eleji pár perces pakolászás kimaradhatna, de egyelőre még nem találtam meg a megoldást rá.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/NfT5WXl0UFE

Karuba is an simultaneous tile laying game of sorts. Up to four players take a player board which has a grid on it. They then take a set of 36 tiles and layout adventures and temples on the outskirts of their grid but all players have the same paths on their tiles and the same starting places for temples and adventurers.

One player acts as bingo caller turning their tiles over and randomly drawing one at a time (they are all numbered) Players can place them anywhere as long as they are orientated correctly, or discard them to move an adventurer.

It is a compelling and addictive game, that demands to be played again and again to see if you can build a more efficient path and then compare your path to your friends. 

A couple of small cons - set up time for a family game, but it's hard to see a way around that, and it can feel a bit solo-y but it is so quick you won't mind and the interaction comes in comparing paths at the end and trying to get to the temples first.

A great game for family and casual players. Each player has their own board to play on and they create their own paths in a race to reach all the temples first. The rules are simple but it's not always as easy as it seems to place tiles without blocking paths to the temples.

I bought two copies so we can play with up to 8.

The second copy doesn't have the Spiel Des Jahres Nominee Seal.

When I first heard about Karuba it was about how the game was a great game that can be played with an unlimited amount of people. But the way the game plays I feel it is almost like a solitaire mode with people around. Trying to find a variant that allows a little more interaction as the only thing that is interacting in the game, is everyone getting to pick where an Explorer starts, and where a Temple ends. Not a game I particularly enjoy, but it's not a bad game.

Very interesting game.

Like: simultaneous, no/low downtime, different mentalities and starting spots for adventurers and temples game to game add a lot of variety and replay unexpectedly, good production value (as a near colorblind, the color choices worked very well), and overall pretty fast/solid experience

Dislike/Neutral: not that much strategy in the game, as it's a decent bit of luck if the right tile may come out or not...so not a huge fan of that. I think it's tolerable though as it's meant to be for family/children gaming and is more meant as a gateway of sorts.

RATING: 9
Almost a perfect game. Three small complaints: 1. The simultaneous action where you can copy other players is resolved can lead to a strange stalemate situation. 2. They should have had the expedition leader draw numbers, instead of their own tiles since its a bit of a disadvantage to not be able to study the unused tiles during the downtime. 3. The setup can lead to some boring or repetitive games if the players aren't careful.

[b]Karuba[/b] was sold via auction 9/22/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A Quick Update:[/COLOR]

[i]Since buying Karuba I've found two games which offer a similar game play experience without the excruciating set up. At this point I'd easily recommend Avenues or Traxx over Karuba.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]The more I've played Karuba the more I've enjoyed it. My concerns about replay value and the game being "solved" have been unfounded; Karuba is a very well designed, family friendly game. In fact in a time of so many complex games being produced I have more appreciation for a design that is easy to teach and fun to play while still offering interesting decisions; you will not be consulting the rule book every five minutes while playing Karuba. Set up still isn't fun, but there is really no way around it so I consider it a necessary evil.

I would highly recommend Karuba for families, especially if you are looking for those next step games to play as your kids get older. My youngest just turned 7 and she isn't interested in a lot of the children's games we have so Karuba has joined the list of great family games she's ready to explore (Coloretto, Dream Home, Habitats, Indigo and Sushi Go Party have all been hits as well).[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]- If you enjoy spacial puzzles this is the game for you, you are building your pathways as you go based on a random tile draw.
- Great filler/week night game, it plays in 15 - 20 minutes...
- However set up is long and painful (when compared to the play time) because you really need to line up all 36 tiles in numerical order so you can quickly play the game.
- Questions about how long this game will remain fun; even though you randomly draw tiles and place temples/explorers there seems to be an efficient way to build your network regardless of the randomness.

Karuba is a great game to introduce to families new to the hobby, it only takes a few minutes to explain the rules of the game and then your off and running. Personally Karuba is my favorite game among the new family game night line published by HABA; in fact Adventure Land and Spookies have already left my collection. Still, questions abound on the long term replay value of this game, but for now my kids and I are having fun playing building our routes in Karuba. [/i]

Aki szereti az olyan játékot amiben a másiknak nem lehet keresztbe tenni, azoknak ideális lesz ez a játék. 4 kalandort kell a megfelelő templomhoz minél hamarabb eljuttatni és közben kincseket szerezni. Minden játékos ugyanazzal a felállással kezdi a játékot (ez a felállás minden játékban más lesz) és minden játékos ugyanolyan lappal építi az utat mint a többi. Van egy expedícióvezető akinek a lapkái felfordítva vannak, abból kiválaszt egyet. Bemondja a lapkán lévő számot, a többiek kikeresik a saját lapkáik közül ugyanazt a lapkát, majd elkezdi építeni az utat, vagy eldobja a lapkát és lép az egyik kalandorral. Lapka lerakásnak a szabályai: bal felső sarokban kell lennie a számnak és csak üres helyre lehet lerakni. A másik játékost nem lehet akadályozni, mert mindenki a saját tábláján építi az utat. Kalandorok mozgatásával kristályt illetve aranyat gyűjthetünk a megfelelő lapkákon, melyek pontokat érnek a játék végén. Aki előbb beér a templomba az kaparintja meg a legértékesebb kincset, aki ez után ér be kevésbé értékes kincset kap. Akinek a legtöbb pontja lesz a játék végén megnyeri a játékot.
A játék elemei szépek, semmi extra.
Ideális gyerekekkel vagy/és olyan felnőttekkel játszani akik nem szeretik a játék közbeni interakciót.

I'd describe Karuba as a cross between Take it Easy! and Metro. Each player has their own player board, and they are placing tiles on it to try to connect their adventurers on one side of their board to the corresponding temples on the other side of their board. One player shuffles their tiles and draws one at random and announces it; the other players find that tile in their stack and everyone places that tile. Tiles can either be placed to form paths, or discarded to move their adventurer a number of spaces equal to the number of exits on the discarded tile. When an adventurer pawn reaches its temple, the player claims a point token for that temple's color--these tiles decrease in value as more players reach that color temple. While I do tend to like Take It Easy-style games, this one didn't really excite me too much. It's a fine filler, but I didn't really feel like it had much tension.

Family weight tile laying game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If one is in the mood for a light-weight tile-laying puzzle game, then Karuba is the game for you. Players start out with an empty map of the jungle, which separates four different explorers from the temples that they are each trying to reach. One player is the expedition leader who reveals jungle tiles at random, each of which has trails leading through it. The other players draw the same tile from their lot and everyone places it in the jungle as they wish trying to make a continuous path from each explorer to the appropriate temple. Instead of placing the tile, players can choose to discard it in order to move their explorers along a given path. And as the explorers make their way to their destination, they may happen along gold or gems that they can collect in addition to the bounty lying in wait in their temple.

This is a fast & fun romp that is great for kids and adults. The idea of giving everyone identical tiles that they can each use in their own way to come to completely different solutions is very interesting. Regardless of whether a person wins or loses, it is great fun to build the jungle map during the game and at the end it's fascinating to see how the other players came up with radically different solutions using the exact same set of tiles (even in the same order)!

[floatleft][ImageID=2980043][/floatleft]Karuba is fun game but it felt a little bland in my opinion. The best strategy of the game seemed to be to make as minimal amount of direct paths as possible and move your explorers. The second game I played I tied for first place with another player and our boards were identical with some minor variations on tile numbers.

This is a very quick, basic game where each player is trying to be the most efficient at getting their meeples to the temples on their board of matching colors. One player draws a tile at random, and then each player has the choice of placing it on their board, or discarding it to move a meeples across previously placed tiles. The components are nice, and it's fine, although there's really no player interaction. The tension is supposed to come from fighting with your previous tile choices.

I was excited to try out this game after it was nominated for the Spiel des Jahres. The game sounded simple and the theme looked okay. It felt completely flat with me. It probably can't stand up to repeated plays. I also think the number caller has a disadvantage as he/she can't see the remaining tiles. It's also easy for players to copy each other's tile placements. It's just too unsophisticated. It probably does not have the allure to make it back to the table again.

You always end up saying "let's play one more time and I'll do better!". Which never happens of course. Not sure about the replayability though, yet a delight to see explorers following different paths to victory with some intense decision making in the middle. Low on interaction, so I'm a bit surprised it got nominated for SDJ.

Wow, this game is super simple but really fun. I think it helps that it plays so fast and there is almost no downtime due to everyone taking their turns at the same time. The game changes slightly every time you play because of the variable set-up and the randomness of the tile draw. Def not a deep game but might be the best game I've played in the 15 min range. Plays faster than Red7, just had to clarify the last comment, hehe.

Much more engaging then I thought it was going to me. You lay pathways to through the jungle to try to connect 4 explorers with temples of the matching colors (on the opposite side of their player board).

Each player places the exact same tiles each round but it's amazing how different the pathways evolve.  The only was to move your explorers is to discard a path tile, rather than place it in your jungle.

Recommended family game.

Um híbrido de "Don Quixote" com "Take it Easy", e um cheirinho a "AmazeING Labirinth", muito simples e que chega a ser irritante pela possibilidade de copiar o movimento dos adversários, motivo pelo qual precisa de uma "houserule" como do pão para a boca. Componentes engraçados, quadros bonitos, uma boa ideia mas uma jogabilidade que precisa de qualquer outra coisa para ser mesmo boa, uma vez que é um jogo que se bem jogado por todos dá em empate. É agradável, porém, a expectativa era ainda maior, pelo que acabo por perceber melhor o porquê de ser editado pela HABA, do que propriamente o porquê de ter chegado a finalista SdJ...

RATING: 6.8
I really like Haba games for my five year old daughter so I was very intrigued with this new line of game that cater to adult gaming or family gaming.  This one is mostly an abstract game  of exploration that incorporate tile laying with a heavy amount of luck mitigation.    It's tough not to pigeon hole yourself in this game and often we;re try to stall to get the crucial tiles need.  The luck can be quite frustrating as you are trying to build these routes bu the tiles you need just don't come up even when the probably is heavy in your favor.  This sucked some of the fun or this one for me.  It is a short game so it does have that for it to mitigate the luck frustration.  Overall, the game was just okay for me.

This is a game for babies! We were so excited for this but massively let down. The only thing it has over Don Quixote is gems. Other than that, Quixote is better in every possible way - there are more strategies, less organizing/fiddling with tiles, and just more fun and satisfying in general. After five games I really don't know if we'll ever play Karuba again but we're still playing Quixote after almost ten years.

Karuba is a fairly abstract game. Where players have an individual player board with four different explorers and and four different temples on the outer edges of the board. Players place the same pieces that are called out much like bingo. Each piece called out has different pathways through the jungle each player can either place the pathway on their board or discard the piece to move an explorer toward the temple of the same color as the explorer.  The person with the most efficient path wins.  

Pros: simple rules, easy to grasp. Fast game play, Fun mechanisms, beautiful components. Fun for all age groups.

Cons:no deep strategy, some luck based gameplay.No strong theme.

I need to play this again, but I was a bit unimpressed. The setup took forever, setting all the tiles up around the board, but that is necessary, because if you don't do that you'll be rifling through all of them all game looking for the right one. The decisions aren't THAT challenging as you can't orient your tiles however you want, and it just left me feeling a bit bored. Not bad. Not great.

Imho, the best gateway game in the market now. Simple rules and gameplay, yet offers plenty of great decisions and an everchanging puzzle that is different on every game, so it can also work with advanced gamers just as well. Add to that an element of racing, and timing becomes crucial. The designer knocked it out of the ballpark with this one. Karuba is the bomb!

:d6-1: I've read that there is a solo way to do this, but I don't know that there are many reviews of this variant.  It seems like the kind of game easily played solo, with adaptation li k e l saw in that thread.

I love mazy pathy building twisting tile laying ones li k e this, and gemmy bits too. And it's good for two as well, and a relatively quick game. This could be right up my alley! I suppose I could ask solo guild people if they've played the variant.

RATING: 3.5
Pure MPS puzzle. Bingo meets puzzle (Take it Easy and descendants). However it's very thematic in the genre and looks quite evocative - each player has a board with 4 wooden people try to get to 4 wooden temples and grab some loot on the way (all players dealing with same setup).

It's pretty much just a game of optimisation. I mostly won by imagining the ideal route before the first turn. Okay, given players with similar skill, the timing would become more important and the race for each temple tile (1st/2nd/3rd/4th place). 

We were thinking of using this in our gaming workshops for kids but decided against it. It's just not socially engaging enough. Too much planning and long term thinking. Playing it with adults it's meh. I mean as fun as optimisation is fun - nice that it's spatial optimisation instead of engine building, but still. But charming for what it is.

RATING: 7
Fun maze building (path building) game. You need to adjust your strategies based on the initial placements and the order in which tiles are drawn. Fairly quick to play and I enjoyed my few plays!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A beautifully produced filler game in the vein of [thing=128][/thing], in which players draw the same, randomly-determined tile each round and decide whether to lay it on the board as a path or discard it to advance an explorer. VP acquisition is roughly divided between racing explorers to temples and picking up treasures which conveniently materialise along the paths. 

While it's brisk and light on rules, Karuba offers some tension in choosing between forming paths and moving explorers. There are also a few subtle choices to be made, like deciding whether it is worth pushing all your explorers to their respective temples. The only catch is that players need to take their actions simultaneously and avoid observing their opponents' moves – something not very easy to commit to if you are the competitive sort who prefers to optimise moves based off what your opponents are doing.

I still rate carcassonne higher than this game as far as tile games are concerned but Karuba is a close second and definitely worth a look.

Love it!

Simple tile laying game. Reminds me so much of Knizia'a Connections but without the nasty no dead ends rule.

Each player has the same 36 tiles and everyone sets up the board the same with the explorers starting on the beach side and the temples on the forest sides.

One player then shuffles all their tiles and draws one at a time, indicating which number tile drawen. Then each player has the choice of either placing the tile or dicarding the tile and moving their explorer alone the path of already placed tiles by the same number as exits on the tile.

Some tiles have treasure which can be picked up if the explorer stops their move on the tile for bonus points. 
Points are awarded for getting to each coloured temple before your opponents.

Play till all tiles are used, or one player get their 4 explorers to the corresponding coloured temple... That's it! Ideal game to get newbies into tile laying games (more so than even Carc..).

Nekem elsőre rögtön a Sanssouci ugrott be a játékról. Ebben is a célunk utakat csinálni, amivel ebben felfedezőinket juttatjuk el a saját templomaikhoz, ebben nem egy tablóról tudunk kártyákkal elemet választani, hanem sokkal egyszerűbben, egyik játékos véletlenszerűen felcsap egy útelemet és ezt kell mindenkinek beépítenie a területére. Rettentő egyszerű mechanizmus, mégis jól működik. Az kevésbé értékes (kereszteződés nélküli) utakon lehetnek ékkövek, amiken felfedezőnkkel megállva pontokat szerezhetünk begyűjtésükkel. A választási lehetőségünk a táblánkon való letevés mellett, hogy a felcsapott elem útkivezetésének számát lelépjük valamelyik felfedezőnkkel és ilyenkor nem rakjuk le az elemet. A 4 felfedezővel leggyorsabban beérők egyenként magasabb pontokat kapnak, plusz a felszedett ékkövek értékei adják az összpontszámot. Rendkívül egyszerű, rendkívül gyors játék, a dobozon megadott 30-40 percnél akár bőven gyorsabban is lejátszható egy parti nem sokat gondolkodó játékosokkal. Jogosan volt SdJ jelölt. Az merült fel bennem két játék után, hogy a jó stratégia az lehet, hogy a véletlenszerűen felkerülő felfedezők és templomok közti utat már látatlanba meg kell tervezni, ami legyen minél kevesebb elemből álló és után már azt kell megépíteni, ha nem ebbe kellő elem jön, akkor lépni valamelyik bábunkkal. Ettől függetlenül változatos a játék, a véletlenszerű felhelyezés és lapkajövés miatt, de a Sanssoucit egy icipicit hozzám közelebb állónak érzem, de a pontszám ugyanannyi.

A solid title and worthy SdJ nominee. It's certainly quite light, but I really enjoy the bingo-style tile selection and trying to work out the best set of paths on your board. It's got a bit of a press-your-luck element to it, since as you begin to assemble your paths, you have to decide whether or not to wait for the perfect tile or just block off an explorer and score the points you can get. It plays fast and I like the puzzly aspect of this.

RATING: 6.5
Simple tile-laying multiplayer solitaire puzzle type of game like Take It Easy but without all the math, instead with a somewhat interesting puzzle and token movement logistics puzzle. Good family game.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Everyone has the same set of tiles, each showing a jungle with roads exiting on 2-4 edges, possibly with a crystal (white or yellow). At the start, everyone places an adventurer Meeple and a matching treasure token on the same positions on their own player boards. Each turn, on player picks a random piece and places it on their own board; everyone else finds that same piece and does the same (initial rounds should be done without looking at other boards, so everyone will likely end up with a different layout). Alternatively, you can trash that tile and move one of the needles along the roads: up to one step (tile) per edge with a road on it (2-4 steps). If you end on a tile with a crystal, keep it. If you end at the treasure token, take the most valuable token of that color (5-4-3-2). If any player gets their 4th Meeple to the treasure, the game ends immediately. The game also ends if all tiles have been called/placed. Score VP for the chits, 1/white crystal, 2/gold crystal; most VP wins!

I love the theme of being an Indiana Jones type trying to find a path to the temple. I also though the bingo like mechanism to call out which path the lay next was interesting, but overall the game fell flat for me. This is a very light gateway game. I would rather play ticket to ride, which has the same feel of path optimization, but feels more strategic.

It's not that I don't like it because I do but something is lacking in Karuba. The mechanics and game play are reasonably unique but it is not a very exciting game. I enjoy the puzzly aspect of building the jungle paths, I really do. And often I don't mind solitary game play but I prefer those games to be a bit more complex, Karuba is a rather simple game and while taking longer than most fillers it plays only a tiny step up from typical fillers. And while I like fillers with Karuba it comes back to the fact that something is missing and I am actually a bit surprised this game gets as much praise and fame as it does (and was nominated for Spiel des Jahres).

For a game this easy to teach, learn and play, Karuba is surprisingly fun. It is a fast paced game in which players are trying to lead a group of adventurers to different temples. This is done by placing tiles on the board in order to create travel routes and then spend actions to move adventurers along these routes. On their way, they are also given the chance to get additional points by picking up riches. Sadly, I truly dislike the art work and components of the game, which undeniably have become an important factor when rating board games nowadays.

A simple to learn tile laying game. Each player has the same setup and draw of tiles. Get the appropriate explorer to the correct temple optionally picking up jewels along the way. This covers all age groups and levels of gamer. There is enough meat on it to charm most avid gamers.

Multiplayer-solitaire connection game in the vein of Take it Easy, but with some thematic chrome added. Players simultaneously use the same jungle tile, either placing it on their board to extend a route (and perhaps add a gem) or to move one of their explorers a number of steps equal to the number of exits. Points are scored for being the first to get each explorer to its target temple and for gems picked up along the way.

It's a great little light tile-laying game with a hefty dose of luck. There is not enough to it for me to want to play it again but it works very well.

[HABA 2016 edition] {Adventure; tile-placement; scalable} Karuba is a fun family game.  It is suitable for children, too.  Competition is quite good - in getting the temple bonus tiles.  I can say this is a more thematic Take It Easy.

It is easy to teach the rules.  Only the number of pawn movement is not that intuitive (why the number of movement points is related to the number of exit of the drawn tile).  The setup is a little bit clumsy but it is still acceptable.  The card illustration and the temple tiles are good.  The game board is so so.

RATING: 9
Highly recommended fantastic new tile laying game where up to 4 players play with exactly the same tiles and goals at the same time with their own individual boards and tiles. The strategy is what each player decides to do with the tiles.  3-4 is most competitive, but 2 players also very good. Nominated for 2016 Speil des Jahres Game of the Year with good reason.  About 30-40 min to play. Not hard for younger players (7 and up)

Really really good family type game.  Excellent for learning gamers as it presents some real decision making in the process of placing tiles.  Having said that, it's a little simplistic in execution (as per Haba reputation).  I think it does exactly what it aims to do, and does that extremely well.

Fun, light, group solitaire game.  The amount of chance may turn some off over the course of many plays of the game, but that also adds an element of suspense as far as if/when you get a jungle piece you need to complete a path, you have that "a ha!" moment.  

I really enjoy it as a filler game and as a gateway game to introduce non-gamers into the world of boutique tabletop gaming.

Simple but challenging game which we use as a filler game. I always play as expedition leader which adds a little complexity as you can't see the remaining tiles available unless you look at the fellow players' tiles.

Solitaire puzzle contest. I can see people liking Carcassone and such to really enjoy this, as it has a very clever barebones design. Thumbs up for that.

For me, it doesn't have interaction (not even indirect!) and it is simply a puzzle to solve.. so meh. Feels too much like work, not enough fun.

tl;dr: fine family game

This is yet another take on the mechanism where one user draws something random (a tile in this case) and all the other players place an identical tile. In this case you are tying to create paths to connect corresponding markers and you try to score some bonus points along the way.
Nothing new here, but it works very well and it's enjoyable.

RATING: 6.5
The idea of everyone drawing and placing the same route tile to race to 4 temples (all identically placed) didn't fill me with excitement. In practise, it played quite well, though I'd have a horrible feeling people might try to game it and hesitate on deciding what they're going to do until they've seen what others are doing.

It played smoothly and quickly and it definitely seemed that the better player won. Which was odd, because this seemed super light. An enjoyable, if deeply unmemorable, experience.

I like the ease of play, and the lack of downtime, and the puzzly nature. It's a bit simple but beware, the choices you make matter. I'm not sure I've yet worked out the perfect way to build, and many times I find myself trapped by my own decisions. I have some issue with the simultaneous action and wish there was a better system (maybe hide player boards while selecting actions? Or alternating turn order?) as it's tempting to simply look at what others are doing and follow suit. It's cooled for me a little bit, but still fun to play.

RATING: 7
Fun game, similar to Take it Easy in that it uses a Bingo mechanic and each player has their own player board. The simultaneous play makes for a quick game that feels like just the right length.

Once concern, though, is that the rulebook doesn't address an important situation in the game. A lot of times you want to wait to see whether your opponent places their tile or uses it to move so that you can see if they'll get to a temple before you. There's no rule about who should place or discard their tile first in this instant. I would like to see an official word about it because this comes up multiple times per game.

Overall, a fun, light-weight game that lasts just the right amount of time.

Karuba is fantastic. The game is very simple and easy to learn and teach but the gameplay feels very deep and incredibly satisfying. There is virtually no luck in the game whatsoever. Everyone starts with the exact same setup, and everyone is placing the exact same tiles every turn. At the end of the game all of the player boards usually look drastically different though. The game is a puzzle that has to be unlocked. It says 2-4 players on the box but you could easily play this one solo as well and try to have the most efficient score and draw random tiles. New this game costs $40 dollars which is reasonable. I haven't played many HABA games in the past but this one is a winner in a big way. I will suggest this game to anyone that dislikes luck and likes to solve puzzles. Out of the three Spiel nominees this was my pick, it's not as accessible as Codenames but I enjoy it much more. Great game.

Even though I regard Herr Dorn as a quality designer, and I do appreciate the straightforward design of Karuba, the game lacks excitement for me. It feels like a solitaire puzzle that requires a setup time that is very long considering the short playing time. All in all I can see how people enjoy playing it regardless, but this kind of game is not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solitaire exercise in creating a network of roads linking the adventurers with their respective temples (why is purple forbidden to explore other temples?). This game has roots in Burley's "Take it Easy" in that every player has their set of own tiles and trying to form connections as each tile is called out. This is an extremely individual exercise with virtually no interaction between players except for the race in grabbing temple tokens. So going in with that in mind, I thought the game was fun. It is short and does not overstay its welcome. For a family game, I don't mind pulling this out for 20 minutes of distraction. However, this is not a gamer's game (after all, HABA produced the game) at all and and not for anyone who hates low player interactions.

Karuba takes the abstract simultaneous tile laying mechanism of Take It Easy and smears a thin layer of theme on it.

The retail price is pretty steep but if you can find a copy second hand, go for it!

Family filler tile placement bingo variant. All players have jungle boards with identical setup and identical sets of path tiles.  One person calls from their shuffled face down stack "bingo style".   Players simultaneously choose how to use the drawn tiles to further their paths or advance their colored meeple explorers along the paths to reach the matching temples. It's a race to get to those temples while picking up sparkling gems along the way.

Now played plenty and can confirm the game a simple, solid beauty with high quality HABA art and componenta. The tiny diamond and gold pieces are a joy to collect as are the browny/purpley temple artifacts. I think I enjoy pathway games like this more than abstracted journeys like Incan Gold.

I particularly like the art and components in this one, with just the right cartoony art style and lush tones for beach and jungle. Also the toned down colour schemes chosen for the players, temples and artifacts - a mix of pleasing cyan, orange and brown in place of the usual garish reds and yellows suits me just fine. Just lovely all round this one and a game that works with young and old. Can see rising to a 10 if I get brave enough.

Setup was slow for first few games but now group 10s 20s 30s in any order for faster reference. Publisher could colour code numbers for next print to make faster to order at game start. Blue numbers 0-9, Green 10-20 etc.

Recently read a bgg-er saying when he's not the 'caller' he sorts his 36 tiles into a square of 6x6. This sounds neat and will try next time.

Update: Like the idea of some furniture getting in the way, such as the volcano, so will grab this to give the game a twist.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun mix of Tsuro (tile-laying) and Bingo (random tile-drawing). It's a race to make a path through the jungle to reach the temples first. It's a well-balanced game, where you have to forfeit laying a tile down to get your explorer to move - so you have to be wise about planning your progress. And there are just enough sparkly doo-dads (treasures you collect along the way) to make it fun for younger kids. 

The only drawbacks are that it takes a little while to set up, so it might not make it to the table when you're looking for a quick game. And sometimes the placement of the temples and explorers can make it very difficult to make a path. But that's not really the fault of the game.

All-in-all, a great family game, especially with pre-teens and younger. Older folks might find it too juvenille. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Karuba originally looked to me to be a bit more of a puzzle game than it ended up being.  I thought it would be strategic but it turned out to be much more tactical.  There is a bit of strategy in there, but the randomness of the tiles and the scoring of the temples decreasing with each player completing it often in game play forces you to take short term tactical actions sometimes abandoning what you had planned to do at the start.  

We really enjoy this game when a lighter game is needed.  Our 14 year old niece really enjoys this game too.  It's on the lighter side as well as being rather quick (30 mins or so is reasonable to get through it).  That makes it perfect for an a few games after the kids go to sleep, waiting for the rest of a group to show up to go somewhere, or between larger games.  It is easy to each, easy to understand, and each game has different decisions to make based on the "random" temple/explorer setup and the random ordering of the tiles.

There is skill and thought involved enough so that those players will most often win, but there is also enough luck and situational mayhem that others can pull off a victory from time to time.  And even though the most skilled player may win most often, the scores are often still rather close.  There isn't a run away effect here that makes the people that don't win feel crushed.  

This fits perfectly into games that me and my wife like to play ourselves as well as into the larger game group.  It's fun, quick, easy to teach, easy to setup and a good time.  It doesn't have too much depth, but has enough variation to be interesting for the time that it takes to play.

I was really looking forward to getting this game but ever since I have had it I have felt underwhelmed. I find the whole thing rather basic and where I once thought it would be full of strategy, I now feel it is pretty obvious what to do and therefore it lacks excitement.
Not bad by any means but not really 'that' good either in my opinion.

Having more recently played Kokoro (Avenue game) I think I will struggle to justify playing this in future which is a shame considering it's nice production.

Haba knocks it out of the park with this one. Indiana Jones theme, tile laying, path building goodness. There is one minor meta that hasn't seemed to fail - Build around the outer edge only. This seems the only sure fire way to connect to all temples and all explorers. That aside, I do love this game. I'm so glad someone made Bingo into a real game. This is it, real Bingo is Karuba.

Fun game, but it's a little lighter than you first expect.

A pleasantly torturous bingo-format game, but in which you choose where to place the called tile, rather than just insipidly cover what's printed on a board. Not only that, but you want to form usable paths with your tiles, so your adventurers can reach the treasure. Not only that, you want to get there before your opponents to maximize the worth of your discoveries. Of course, Rüdiger is no fool, so there are also gems and gold nuggets along the path that you can only pick up by ending your movement on the tile in question, tempting you to move more slowly at times. The even more clever part is that 2 gold + 1 gem is equal to first-to-find-any-given-artifact, so it actually may be more worthwhile to collect things along the path, ignoring the "prize". The more I think about this, the more I want to play it again.

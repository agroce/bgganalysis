Someone in my group was kind enough to sell this to me for €3 (cheers Jimmy) and I've been playing it lots. I love the 70s retro graphics of SPI from the period and this is a great little game. 100 counters , 8 pages of rules with the last two being notes and charts.

LOST: Lost 27-7 as the (east) German, and the (west) Allied player.  I made it through to Game 10 before Berlin was captured by the Soviets  As a first time player of the game, I was against an experienced player.  Rules were easy to follow.   I liked the idea in the east of holding back the inevitable.  The feedback I was given was that I was not aggressive enough - probably true, as the CRT 1-1 1-2 columns in particular can actually be beneficial when you are the attacker. Very enjoyable, and I have posted some pics of the game, which I hope they will post.

Played this years ago at School Wargames Club.  Not a bad game.  Simple to learn, but hard to master, if I recall.  I'd rank it as an average wargame.  I'd play it back then and probably now too, but it's not one I'd reach for quickly.

 Jugado a tres es un juego divertido. El alemán lo tiene difícil, pero no imposible, pues no va a derrotar a los otros dos, simplemente a contenrlos. La regla de escenario a tres de triplicar el movimiento cambiando de frente le da ciertas posibilidades defensivas muy interesantes. Juego muy bien pensado y entretenido. Mucho más rentable que otros juegos muco más sesudos. Sin grandes pretensiones y con la única intención de entretener. Ideal para jugar con personas que quieren iniciarse en el wargame y se pierden en las reglas y los cuarteles generales.

I found this game disappointing.  The Eastern Front part of the game is overly abstracted and the Soviets are really unable to use most of their strength points.  The world needs more 3 player games but this is not one of the best ones.  The two player version had some interest in that each player played the opposite side on the opposite front(e.g., Germans in West and Soviets in East).

Received a copy in trade. DG version which actually looks like a nice upgrade from the original.

RATING: 7
A wargaming classic. Beautiful simplicity that flows quite historically for such a low complexity game.

In the two-player game, each side gets to play a juggernaut offense and a desperate defense. 

Also works as a three (or even four player) game if you can find a masochist to play the German side alone (or perhaps a veteran wargamer as the Germans against two new gamers playing the Allies).

Great game for introducing new players to "real" wargames.

Nice novice wargame, great for those ready to move up from the introductory level.  Plays great, nice play balance, short ruleset (no supply, no unit types, simple ZOC, standard CRT, ... ), can be played in an evening.  Very flexible, too, accomodating three, even four players if need be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A classic old school SPI - with all the negatives that entails.  The Allies pound on the wall, the Soviets grind along.  The Germans on either front use ZOCs and the rules to hold out as long as possible.  Its a good game, but not worth the table time.

(2007-10-31) Just a way cool game.  The standard two player game is fantastic as both players, Western Allied and Soviet, attack and defend by the nature of having each control the German pieces on their opponent's front.  The three player option is also excellent with one player controlling all German forces.  The game is simple to learn and easy to play yet challenging to play well.  I somewhat agree that with good east German play the soviets will rarely get to Berlin in time, but if you approach the game as a great intro level game to teach somebody the basics of a wargame it is very high in potential.  And when you combine this with both players being on the attack and defense it very quickly achieves this objective.

I have both the original SPI version and the DG reprint.  I don't care for the changes DG made.  The map and graphics are more attractive but the Corland reinforcements don't work the way they intended -- another example of not enough (or any?) testing before printing.

This was my favorite wargame back in the day. I played it so much had to buy the Decision Games version. Love that you play as both Germany and Allies and even the 2-player version (one player plays the Western Front Allies and the Eastern Front Germans while the other player plays the Eastern Front Allies and the Western Front Germans). With the 2 fronts being so different - west is a more of a slug-it-out affair, while the east is more fluid and open - both players get to play both styles.

RATING: 8
Comment faire original avec des règles très simples. Un jeu étonnant car le système est vraiment obsolète. Par contre, toute la finesse du jeu vient du fait du double rôle joué par chaque joueur (Alliès+Allemands face aux Soviétiques contre Soviétiques+Allemands face aux Alliés). Du coup, chaque joueur se retrouve à la fois attaquant et défenseur.
Les conditions de victoire sont de plus parfaitement bien dosées...Le plus dur reste très certainement de prendre Berlin!
Une réussite, que cela soit en solitaire, à deux ou même à 3 joueurs...

Tight, clever little game which plays easily in an evening.  Lots of tough choices for each player (esp. for the German player in the East).  Despite the absence of lots of fiddly rules and special exceptions (otherwise known as "Chrome"), the game gives an excellent feel for the final phases of WWII. My only complaint: you need to create your own "fortification destroyed" and "captured city" markers.  Otherwise, a lot of bang for your buck.

Battle for Germany is a great game. I own both editions. Check out the Grognard site for the differences between the 1st and 2nd eds (vehicle icons for example, some unit values, a few units added).
Note however, the countermix and thus the historical order of battle were limited by the game format, many German corps and some Wallied units are missing. There is also an Eastern Front only scenario included, as well as a Wallied vs Soviets slugfest. Highly recommended!

The definition of a classic SPI hex-and-counter wargame. A fun asymmetrical game where you each try and use German units to stall your opponent while racing to Berlin. The Russians will definately make it there in 5 or so turns, but the Americans have some dicey options. Not a game that demands a ton of re-play, but a classic that is certainly worth the price of admission.

The most unique aspect of this game is that it allows each player to play the Germans (either west or east front) and it's basically a race to see if the Wallies or Reds will reach Berlin first! Combat system shows its age more than other games from this time period, due mainly to the ludicrous number of terrain defense multipliers (what, your total defense in that hex is 30 points, so adding my 8 point soviet front to the battle won't even increase my odds step? Come on!) Maybe the CRT needs more intermediate steps than the typical 2-1, 3-1 etc. (?) As it stands, it becomes a real math excercise (more so than other wargames) as you try to find ways to use your attacking units so their rating will actually contribute something to the battle (ie., gain an odds step). Overall, still a good intro wargame.

I picked up S&T 50 on eBay for a reasonable price recently, it arrived today (6.XI.07) and I had my first game this evening, three players with me as Germany.  I won!  My first impression is that "Battle for Germany" lives up to the high ratings and positive reviews it has amassed over the years.  A real classic, and one I'll be playing a lot more.

The only nit I could find to pick is the replacement rules for the Western Allies.  These are fair enough for the USA, but by this stage of the war Britain was at the end of her manpower resources: indeed sometime in early '45 one infantry division (44th, or maybe 50th, I forget) had to be disbanded to keep the others up to strength.  Thus, seeing any and every British unit destroyed in combat promptly reappearing on the Western edge of the mapboard in the very next turn is straining credibility somewhat.

When all's said and done though, a great game.

Typical 1970s-era SPI game. Simple, but too long a playing time coupled with crazy dice-roll results determining the outcome of the game. W. Allies need some tremendous lucky dice-rolling especially, since the Russians will usually get to Berlin before they do. 

It's a classic but not one to play again.

This game plays very cleanly.  I'm not sure, however, that the Soviets can't win routinely by holding in the south and attacking wildly in the north.  Even with losses, the East Germans melt away and the Soviets waltz into Berlin.

RATING: 9
Perhaps one of the most original wargame designs of all time - you play the Germans on one side of the board and the Allies on the other. This game is Jim Dunnigan at his most most brilliant, most insightful, and most original - and it&#039;s a fun! game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the best folio style games SPI ever made and the DG reissue, while adding more counters to the East Germans and the Soviets, still retains the color and fun of the original title.  Fast playing and versatile while retaining an accurate feel for the topic.  The Soviets steamroll their East German counterparts on the Russian Front while the Allies have a tough time of it on the Italian Front and in the West until late in the game.  

The most innovative feature is that players are cast in both Allied and Axis roles to make the game interesting for both; the Soviet player controls the West Germans on the Italian and Western Fronts fighting the Allies; the Allied player commands the East Germans fighting the Russians.  You can play three player with a Soviet, Allied, and German player (and the actions of the latter usually determines which of the other two wins, if the German can't), or even four player (although the most stoic player should be the East Germans!).

Great social game for that reason and a lighter offering when decompressing from larger monstergames.  Highly recommended.

An excellent game:

Easy to learn, but hard to master.

Basically one player plays Allies/Germans facing the Soviets and one player plays the Soviets/Germans facing the Allies. and both have to race to take Berlin or get the most VPs by taking cities before the game ends(turn 10 or 11).

The intersting part is that the Germans facing the Soviets is controlled by the Allied player and the Germans facing the Allied player is controlled by the Soviet player.

Also quite simple but its all in the play.

Very highly recomended for 3-4 hours of play.

This is a gem to play. You have to play it before passing judgement on it. I have the Decision games version. Its a little different but nothing to scare me away. I like the situation.

A brilliant design! Above all, this wargame is fun, can be finished in an evening, and players must play both offensive and defensive roles. The rules are simple but effective.

Played solitaire. 

This looks exactly like the Napoleon system used by SPI: basically frontal combat does negligible damage. In order to punch a hole you need to surround the enemy and since it cannot retreat it is destroyed. 

While I think the system doesn't work well for Napoleon (where attrition would show during the course of a protracted battle), it works perfectly well here and shows jolly well the slow grind the Allies (Western and Eastern that is) had to face in the final months before the end of the war. 

I discover that I'm enjoying this as I never thought I would.

Ordered this after long research and actually I am not sure what to expect. I have some hopes but do not expect a lot. 
Main drive is to use this game as introductionary game for non-wargamers.

I am attracted by the fact that you play both Germans and Allies at the same time, a brilliant twist to wargaming.

A classic Dunnigan game provides a cleverly conceived but simple strategic model. Whilst nicely produced (barring the multiple errata) the second edition designer misunderstood and eschewed the delicate balance of forces (dare I say, counters) in the original.

Classic two-player wargame on the final collapse of Germany in WWII, famous for the dichotomy of each player's role.  One player plays the Western Allies and the Germans in the east, while the other plays the Soviets and the Germans in the west.  Thus each player has opportunities to attack and defend.  Great stuff.  Unfortunately, the operational system is bone dry.  The bloodless CRT is neither particularly fun nor evocative of this attritional stage of the war.  As with many Jim Dunnigan designs, it has a great idea but needs at least one more.

All the fun - none of the chrome.

7 for the game as it comes out the box - losing a point for paper map and counters that a bit too small for my chunky figures. It goes up to a 9 once the map is doubled in size, mounted on board and proper sized counters produced.

Just never found this game very interesting, despite the rather clever idea of having each player take one of the Allies and the Germans opposing the other player.

Deserves its status as a classic.  However, it's static compared to many games (it pretty much has to be, given its scale).  It makes for a good entry-level wargame, but I would prefer several other games to introduce a new player to the hobby such as Target:Arnhem, Napoleon's Last Battles, Panzergruppe Guderian, Clash of Giants, Deluxe Bitter Woods, or the upcoming A Victory Lost.  The Decision Games edition is what I had -- pay extra for the original!

Somewhat disappointing. After years of searching, and finally finding a decent copy of the original SPI folio version, the first play seemed a bit of a let-down. There are so many positive comments here on BGG, I guess I was expecting a bit more. The game was close, no doubt. And I love the simple mechanics. Still, the stylized unit placement, (always leave a hex between your defensive line units), seemed forced. Nice slugfest for each side, but lacks flavor.

3 / 5 - Good

Interesting re-creation of the end of the war. The easy and accessible movement and combat rules work extremely well for the large formations in the game, making this very much a case of trying to slowly push back and cut off groups of enemy units rather than all out offensive and destruction. The different sides in the game play differently, adding interest and - unusually for a hex-and-counter game - multi-player isn't team based and is well balanced and engaging. There are several scenarios, adding further longevity, a couple of which are pleasingly quick to play (1-2 hours). Has greater than usual wargame suckage on component quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Great little game!  Easy to play (only slightly more complex than AH Stalingrad) if you are 20 and you don't need reading glasses.  Only real detractor is the original SPI tiny units and small hex grid.  Very well balanced game, one of Dunnigan's best for fast play and variable outcome.

I've got the Decision version. This is an enjoyable one, but a little lobsided in the fun.  The Russian/West German player gets to do lots of attacking, while the East German/West Allied player just retreats in the east and stalemates in the west.  The West vs. Russian scenario is quite unique.  The guys from Avalanche actually did the update, but thankfully (and luckily) they didn't change much.

Very nice game and clever indeed.  Being able to play two different forces makes for good fun. Be sure to incorporate the errata (DG version).

Pros:
*Only two unit stacking
*2-4 hours or less play time (playable in one evening)
*Clear 8 page rulebook, very easy to digest and teach
*Good replayability with scenarios + variants
*Excellent intro game, very accessible 
*3 and 4 Player scenarios

Cons:
*As usual, the map is a bit too small (crowded stacking/maneuvering)
*Not really an ideal way to mark destroyed fortifications or 'controlled' cities that are just passed through, although I just use some extra small cubes.  A list would work just as well, although perhaps not as easily.

An easy-to-learn but challenging game that recreates the Western and Eastern Allies push towards Berlin in the latter part of WWII. The Germans are not going to win, but that's not the point: it all comes down to which Allied side can accrue the most Victory Points by capturing cities. For the Soviets in particular, capturing Berlin by the end of Turn 10 (the Historical Scenario) is crucial for victory. There are additional scenarios provided. UP through 2011 I rated this a 7.5, but with additional plays in early 2013 I upped my rating to 8, because it's just such a good GAME. (Note: I agree the Courland rules as published are better left ignored.) Acquired by trade, late September 2008.

Very interesting concept: Russians vs. Western Allies the last months of WWII as they race to take as much of Germany as they can.  With 2-player one player plays the Western Allies and East Germany (trying to stop Russia's advance), and the other player plays Russia and West Germany (trying to stop the Western Allies' advance).  With 3-player one person can play both Germany's.  It's a good game, plays like early Avalon Hill and SPI wargames with hexboard and chits, and has easy rules.  But, it does seem weighted (based on one play) towards Russia as they smash thru East Germany while the Western Allies get bogged down trying to penetrate Germany's western defenses.  Very good game, worth a try.

RATING: 8
One of the best SPI quad-sized games ever.  Can be played as 2,3, or 4 player with only the Western Allies showing little movement early in the game; but plenty of tension all around. Soviets and Allies want lots of exchanges but, whereas the Allies can advance into potentially surroundable positions (due to great repalcement rate), the Soviets need to avoid getting surrounded. Soviets also need to avoid losing too many 8-20-3 to exchanges. The Germans need to be especially careful to avoid surround situations becoming victims and the classic 'flank-to-front' attacks. Italy is a total waste of time and will never matter as is Yugoslavia.

The Collapse in the East scenario is fast playing and great for introducing classic hex-and-counter wargames.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have the original S&T issue version. Very bland map and counters, the black Swiss area is typical of WW2 games sadly. I'd havel ike to see a bit more map to allow the Western Allies to move between the French and Italian fronts... that would liven things up.

But an excellent game. A great idea to have each player play an Ally on one front and an Axis on the other. Works well solo, 2,3 or 4 player. Quick, simple, variable player numbers... what's not to like? 

The Decision Games remake map looks good (I like their style and colour choices) but their counters seem too garish. The old matt SPI ones attract me most: if only the various nationalities had been differentiated in colour like they were in Revolt in the East.

I wonder if someone could do a WWI variant on this game... with *three* fronts: east, west, italy....

Boxed DG version.  The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense.

Classic SPI boilerplate mechanics with a really great situation layered on top, as each player plays the German defenders on the other player's front.  Suffers a bit from poor victory conditions, where even though there are a ton of cities worth some points, it's a rare game where they mean anything since Berlin is worth 10, and the game is automatically a draw if Berlin fails to fall.  The Balkan and Italian fronts are mostly a waste of time, too.  Some tweaks to the VCs to properly incentivise operations and this could easily be a 7 or 8.

1 play, 2er

Interesting, light hex-and-counter game with (fortunately!) a reasonably low chit count and very simple rules. One side plays Soviets + West Germans, against Western Allies + East Germans (i.e., you have your own offense, and play defense on the other front). It's a simple race to get to Berlin -- that player will almost certainly win -- while trying to maneuver around the German defenses. Combat is also straightforward: add up attack and defense values (modified by defensive terrain), roll a d6, and consult the CRT. Use Zones of Control to limit enemy movement (and help get some kills), and hope for some good dice rolls!

Fun game, though maybe a bit long for what it is? Also, though the count is low, you still have to deal with a bunch of chits in tiny little hexes! It would be better with a larger map and thicker counters, and you could certainly use some forceps to manage the chits!

Battle for Germany is a good 2-3 player game.  While the strict ZOC can potentially grind the Western Allied forces to a halt, it probably usually works out fine.  In the light of having played Proud Monster, I appreciate the simplicity of the design and the manageable number of counters.  The end game is marred by a flaw in the ZOC rules which allows the East German player to prevent the Soviets from attacking Berlin by occupying the adjacent hexes and therefore exerting a ZOC over the city.  Given a few fixes to the rules, this is a game with high replay value.

Cool idea and good game play. Not much else to it other than the dual role feature. I have the DG version, which has a nice map but too small, creates some real density issues on the western front.

Good title for a couple hours play. Best advantage to it is that it permits both players to play both offense and defense at the same time. The DG reprint contains changes that do not improve the game and may actually take it down a rating level or two.

I really like the "two players represent three factions" aspect - very innovative.

My comments refer to the DG reprinting (lost my old S&T years ago), but they are very similar.  Great simple fast-paced game.  Germans have ground to give in the East, but are hard pressed in the West. Ifound the Yugo. units really had little bearing on the game.

Enjoyable but not one of my favourites although it is very well regarded.

Great game--truly a classic that was reissued several times over about 20 years. Also one of the few 3 player wargames out there although this game really doesn't work as a 3 player game since the German player has only about 5% chance of winning--works much better as two player game with Soviets/West Front commander vs Allied/East Front commander.

A wargame that proves less is more. Excellent gaming value.

Presumably Dunnigan's greatest idea. Battle for Germany is a simple game with typical 1970's mechanics. Few counters, no mechanized phase or overrun capabilities. Just a simple slugfest. The mechanics wherein one player plays West German/Soviet, while the other plays East German/West Allies is inspired.

A classic. This would really be mainly for collection purposes. 
BEWARE: I am after the OLD S&T version, not DG last rewamp!

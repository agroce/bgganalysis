I must say this game was a rip-roarin&#039; good time and plays relatively quickly given its scope.  Missed the fact that 1939, 1940, naval, and air are missing (naval/air are only sketchily represented in card play), but since this game tries to keep things fairly simple, it was probably worth the trade off.  Since I was more familiar with hex-based strategic games the point-to-point map took me some getting used to (e.g., &quot;where exactly is my eastern front?&quot; &quot;where exactly are my supply lines?&quot;)  Still, I liked this game a lot, and given its relatively short play time, I can see this coming to the table quite a bit. It may not have the strategic richness of say Third Reich, but it does have plenty of tactical possibilities and is full of tough tradeoffs.  My rating may move up in the future.

Initial rating based on my first impressions only of the new edition.  I enjoy CDGs and it seems that my pleasure with this one will be no different as I play it over the years.  I can see that, perhaps, that it maybe a bit prescriptive, but then again, so are some other CDGS.  I'm sure the new edition has ironed out many of the problems that folks complained about before, and the game looks great, too.  I'm expectiong to be beaten if I play anyone who has a modicum of experience with the game, but maybe my knowledge of the Strategies needed in AHs The Russian Campaign will help just a little.

First, I will admit that I have not played this enough to be an expert.  I've probably played it about 4 times, so here are my impressions:

[b]What I like:[/b] The [thing=91][/thing] applied to the WWII is pretty cool.  Allowing armor units to move on to a space with an attack marker is awesome as a way to create that "blitz" feeling.  Separate decks do a lot to help alleviate bad draws.  It really portrays that the eastern front is where the war was won.

Totaler Krieg is really, really cool!  The Axis win if they can push the victory point meter to 20 and if it becomes apparent that they aren't going to get there, but they are doing so well, they play that card and move the VP meter up, lose the auto-victory, and require the Allies to push it to zero by game's end.  That makes for a tight game.

[b]What I don't like:[/b] With limited resources (in form of operation points), I can't see you recreating Operation Crusader, Torch, Husky, Shingle, Anvil-Dragoon, Overlord, and Cobra.  Yeah, you have invasion cards, but you have to GET them to draw in a certain order and then spend the operation points to actually use them while neglecting the Soviet front.  So you neglect it and you miss the two front war.  You end up with required operations just to try to add meaning to a wasted board.

Also, the amount of scripting is ridiculous.  You could invade Normandy, move toward Arnhem, clear out every space in the Scheldt, but you can't use it as a port if you don't draw the Scheldt card.  This is a big problem with Racier's CDGs.  I think Jack Stalica nailed it when he said the amount of scripting makes you feel like you are replaying a session report.  Part of the fun of wargames are exploring other options and see why commanders made the decisions that they did and allows you to try other ones.  I think [i]Roundup[/i] is the only such option this game offers.

I keep thinking if I try it one more time, it will work out, but it never really does.  Frankly, I don't think you can make a single CDG work in the European theater.  The better route is to play [thing=11949][/thing] for North Africa, which takes this system, cleans it up, and makes North Africa a blast.  Then follow it up with [thing=162383][/thing], which simplifies the system and picks up where Shifting Sands left off.  Someday, we may get [i]Clash of Tyrants[/i], which gives us the missing Eastern Front piece of the puzzle.  Otherwise, I would rather play [thing=1563][/thing], though I think the perfect single game covering this topic does not exist and probably never will.

Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike this game, but it is not without disappointment.

A good CDG about WW2 in Europe, but with some issues.
German units are too powerful in the first 13 ops, and often after winter 42, Axis could still try an autovictory.
In the first turns is too simple for German player to neglect events and replacements. 
North Africa and Western Front are often side shows.
I hope that the future Stalin War will fix these issues.

A great improvement over [gameid=91], which I think looks depressing and suffers from weakest link Italy. BtB is a very rich game, with the right feel. Although maybe the armoured units are too mobile when joining battle.

One of the main disadvantages of this game is the hazy way of play. You must be aware of certain cards that have to be played at certain times. It's not a very clear path. Besides you have to know in what way to play a card: operations, event, replacements of strategic move. You have to decide careful for optimal play. But this knowledge easily flows away if you don't play it for a while. It is better to play it by mail than face to face.

Excelente juego, para mí muchísimo mejor que su predecesor Paths of Glory.
Se ha pulido mucho todo el tema del suministro que es aberrante en su hermano mayor.

Es un juego tenso y extremadamente divertido si te gustan los CDGs. Puede ser un poco "dirigido" por los eventos de las cartas, pero eso no me disgusta y en mi opinión asegura el no poder hacer ciertas acciones no posibles históricamente. Es vital la gestión de tu mano de cartas y saber cuando y como jugar los eventos, saber que carta ha salido y cuál no.
Tiene un reglamente muy sencillo para ser un wargame y se disfruta desde la primera carta.

En su parte mala, es muy complicado ganar con el Eje si te enfrentas a un rival competente. Además, dado que el Eje tiene 2 posibles estrategias (corto plazo o largo plazo) una vez elegida una es muy complejo cambiar a la otra (esto no me parece necesariamente malo). Si no consigues la Blitzkrieg, luego es complicado que ganes a largo plazo, ya que no te habrás preparado lo suficiente. Por ello son muchas las partidas que no se prolongan mucho más allá de 1943 (al menos en mi experiencia).

En resumen, para mí de lo mejorcito en CDGs.

Paths of Glory ported to WWII. Unfortunately the mechanics don't work quite as well, and the multi front nature of the conflict often gets in the way of the game - you just want to play everything in the east front, which while possibly an apt historical commentary makes the rest of the game a side show and limits the full usefulness of some cards.

Not as good a game as Paths of Glory as the mechanics don't fit quite as well, but the cards again provide a lot of flavour. And playing the soviets really feels a very tense experience.

Curiously, based on this game you'd have thought an east front only game based on these mechanics would work well, but Stalin's War didn't really cut it for me.

entretaining game, but would have liked to see an operational  system like wilderness war with leaders (generals) on the board affecting combat and suffering penalties if they dissobey their mandated orders (like temporary or permanent removal from the game), less reliance on points and more effects on the strategic situation when strategic objectives are captured ( like loosing a card or limitations on supply etc.)
After not playing it for 6 months tried it again and the rules seem to make more sense. Increased rating from 7 to 9

Designed by Ted Racier, creator of [thing=91][/thing], this game uses a similar card driven system. The rules are a bit more streamlined than PoG with fewer exceptions but there's still lots of chrome. The game begins with the Barbarossa Campaign and ends with the fall of Germany. It's a very long game (8+ hours) but the tense decisions really make the time fly by. I'm looking forward to getting this on the table again soon.

A less interesting follow-up, by Ted Raicer, to PoG.  The first part is "Chase Stalin", which with bad Soviet rolls can end the game, while the latter part involves careful garnering of Invasion cards by the Allies.

I am curious about this statment from Mike Rinella, who rates the game an 8.1.  Mike writes:
"Players who dismiss the game based on the 1941 start date, or that Spain wasn't included, or because it doesn't meet their definition of how "history" should unfold don't want to see the game for what it is, but rather impose their own views of what they thought the game ought to have been, something that misses the point."  What is the point that some of us are missing?

April 27, 2005 & Mike was kind enough to answer my question.  Here is his answer: "BtB isn't about non-Barbarossa alt-history scenarios. BtB isn't about what happened between 1939 and June 22, 1941. BtB isn't meant to be a detailed depiction of the air and naval war in the ETO during WWII. Yet people insist it should have been. Which is Monday-morning, back-seat designing. Talk is cheap."

In his comment box for BtB, Mike adds, " The ratings under 6 for this game are a joke. [Added in 2005]"  Those of us who rate the game lower than Mike are only expressing our opinion, even as Mike is expressing his.    

What do I like in this game?  As usual, the quality of GMT graphics (map, counters, components in general) is superb.  The basic card-driven nature of the system is fine.  You can't do everything that you wish to do or need to do, so you have to make choices while not knowing what cards your opponent is holding.

What do I not like in this game?  Why give it a "1"?  First, it really isn't history, or an historical simulation, but only a game (though its defenders would say, "Oi! And such a game!") dressed up around a WWII theme.  Second, what is present is of a highly scripted, do-this-or-else nature.  Third, given what happened during WWII, this game comes across at times as ahistorical.  Imagine the frustration of not being able to do what your historical counterparts could do all because you didn't draw the right cards.  There is more that will follow at a later time.

I want to comment a bit more about what Mike R. says:
Finally, the game is fun "out of the box" you don't need to be following all the latest quirky updates. The majority of the changes are for the "rules lawyers" and "card sharks" - a vocal minority. Players who dismiss the game based on the 1941 start date, or that Spain wasn't included, or because it doesn't meet their definition of how "history" should unfold don't want to see the game for what it is, but rather impose their own views of what they thought the game ought to have been, something that misses the point. The ratings under 6 for this game do not deserve serious attention."

I find his comments interesting & curious, given how I feel the game both forces you to follow an historical outline, while preventing you from repeating what was historically possible (because it was accomplished).  Mike has helped me to understand further the weakness of this game design.  

Ah!  The joys of being an armchair critic!  Thank goodness there are people willing to buy games that I do not like, or there would be no games for me to play that I do like.  No designer will ever please 100% of the gamers 100% of the time, but thank you Ted R. for working with GMT (possibly the best game company for wargamers) to do what you do.

RATING: 7
Good variation of Paths of Glory in a WW2-theme. 

Tanks can encircle enemies via a second move-action and the game has o good idea for stand-fast orders by Stalin and Hitler. The opposing player may choose armies which may only attack or stand and not go backwards.

Some easy bombing rules would be wonderful as flyers are only included by  some littte events.

Update: it seems to be much more luckdependent than Paths of Glory especially in which order you get your important events. Much more event-driven than PoG.

EDIT 2014- This game is aging very well, expecially if compared to the CDG that were produced later on the same topic. It's still interesting and amusing. I raised the rating.

 The game is quite good, fun too. Outstanding is the event selection in 55 cards. It seems all the more important aspect on the war have been included. I have 2 points to remark. First is that strategically the approach is almost mandatory. I found, for example, extremely difficult to realize Winston Churchill proposed attack to europe soft belly. There are 2-3 main options and that's all. Second, and this is up to personal tastes, the yellow cards make the game very dinamic. If this is ok for a panzer strategy, players have less problems in choosing how to use their cards. There is not the angst and the tight management seen in PoG. To me this is a downside.

RATING: 9
Upgraded. Intense game play - nailbiting tension. Game (and a very good one), not a simulation. Immense historical flavor due to strategy cards. Playing time about 10 hours. While game is won/lost in the east, allies' participation is crucial to make the most out of the allied production advantage (lost if not used up each turn!). Low counter density, therefor mobile warfare is possible. Units can (generally) only attack or move - so delaying tactics are possible (and necessary).

I suspect this was a rushed job to capitalize on the popularity of POG.  If so, it shows.  In any case, the lethargy of the Western Allies is a serious flaw, and despite some nods in that direction to improve cards and rules in updates since release, remains so.

After one play: Two-player, strategic-level, card-driven wargame covering land operations in Europe from 1941-45. Economic, political, airpower, and seapower is completely abstracted into card-play. While this may force the game down the same historical path as the war, the heart of the game is the thrust-and-parry players experience in making and meeting threats with their corps and armies. My game took 9 hours and ended with a German capitulation at the end of 1944. Experienced players can probably bring this down into the 5-6 hour range. If you're a fan of Ted Raicer's games, you may boost this rating a point or two.

This game can be a lot of fun.  Rather strategic, it still requires a player to fully understand the deck before playing.  I don't think that it is "scripted" but there is a lot of interdependency between events (as to when they occur) and playing a card for ops that should be played or kept for the event can really destroy your chances (e.g Soviet Reinforcements, Industrial Evacuation, US Build-up).

While this is an ETO game, the focus really is on the Soviet-German conflict, with the other fronts serving to distract the German effort and draw down on its force concentration in the eastern front.  Probably very realistic, but for some purists, the lack of the early war Blitz on France and the inability to even consider Seelowe might be an issue.

With regards to the Eastern front though, the game is very intense and perhaps this bodes extremely well for the Stalin's War game that is due out in 2009.

All i know is that I will never be able to drive from Warsaw to Moscow without thinking about which circles I can enter and which ones I cannot...  Holding the line is visually challenging at first....

UPDATE: With the new 2nd Edition finally correcting the, ah, unfortunate amount of card eratta from the 1st Edition, I can kick my rating up to a 9. Too bad it took a while to get here, but the original edition did have a number of finishing issues (play and card balance, some map usability stuff), and these now have been thankfully cleared up to bring this in line with what it should have been, one of my favorites of this whole series. Too bad about the length, though. Try Shifting Sands for a game you can complete it one sitting.
---
This game grew on me quite a bit after the first few plays. Like PoG, early games were a bit lopsided, and since I had already played PoG a lot, BtB doesn't get that "new game thrill". BUT, once you've played it a bit, the game is just as tense as PoG, tactically much richer and more interesting, and yet generally less complex and with fewer special rules. You feel like you are "gaming the system" far less than in PoG, with tradeoffs that make more sense and a system that is a more cohesive whole and with fewer wierd edge cases; with all the fronts, PoG definitely degenerates under the strain of extreme strategies, while BtB does not. Now, it's true that the order of card flow has a significant impact on the direction of the game, and that an optimal Allied deck stacking will lead to an Allied blow-out (surprisingly, either converse does not seem to be true), but this sort of thing is a side effect of a game with a reasonable level of uncertainty, and should only affect a fairly small number of games. Anyway, all in all, after some 10 games BtB seems to be fulfilling the promise that PoG didn't *quite* grasp. It would be really nice to see a minor rev of PoG incorporating some of the new stuff from BtB (mainly I'm thinking about the yellow cards). [Update] It is worth mentioning that the eratta for this sucker is problematic. Initial plays are unlikely to be affected by it much, but once the Germans hone their game things can get ugly. It's a shame the amount of card eratta that was required, but to be honest, I don't find it that burdensome. It's only really required once you become familiar with the game, and at that point it's not hard to remember. In the end, neither Barbarossa to Berlin nor Paths of Glory quite reached classic status, but they're both good game.

Same fun system as Paths of Glory.  Doesn't work as well because the Allies tend to spend all their cards as Soviet ops, freezing the Western Front.  Wish it had been developed with a system giving activations on multiple fronts instead of allowing them all to go to the East.  Needs a fix to slow down the German all-ops strategy in 1941-42.  Best fix is probably to make each sequential ops card worth one less than printed value, cumulatively, so first card is full, next is -1, next is -2 etc.  This idea is implemented in Stalin's War I believe.

Intriguing Eastern-Front-centric card-driven joint from the maker of Paths of Glory.

One of my first adventures into longer wargames.  The card mechanic is impressive.  I love the way it forces you to choose.  There are so many things you'd LIKE to do...but you have to prioritize and sacrifice.  Maybe with tons of playing, the game would start to feel scripted somewhat.  But at my level of experience, I find the historical feel charming.   I've enjoyed this one PBEM.  My sense is that this game is fairly well balanced, particularly with the latest rules versions which offer several fixes.  There is a large amount of little fiddly rules, some of which are to add historical feel and some of which are to balance things out.  My playings showed a pretty big advantage to the Axis initially....until the Allied player has sufficient experience to stall the initial onslaught. This game has definitely gotten me interested in other card-driven games. 

The reprint version includes some changes in the former rules, minor updates to the map and fixing the cards quite a bit. Its still tough for the Allies to hold out against the Blitz attack, but they can usually manage. There is quite an ebb and flow as the German onslaught fades out. I have not seen the Axis player win the long game, only as a Blitz victory. Very enjoyable playing.

RATING: 5.5
I WANTED to like it, I love POG, Hannibal, For the People, Wilderness War, but I DON'T like this one. I've got 22 years of wargaming under my belt and I FEEL when the game is right. I felt the greatness of POG even if we did a lot of mistakes in our firs game. This one is a lemon, game play is predictable, the cards put excessive constrain on players. You are not fighting WWII, cards and rules are playing it for you. I found horrible especially the management of allied armies. I played this game 6 times, but I doubt I will in the near future. I wrote the first part when the game came out, in the last weeks I played 3 times using old rules and the new optional rules.
I found that the game is not that horrible (and impossible to win) for the allies if you use the new rules. It's now playiable, but PoG it's not. There is still a lot of constrain on players in order to play some cards in an EXACT ORDER. I found this very annoying, not to mention Typhoon, and Case Blue.

Paths of glory works for world war I, this game doesn't for world war II. Why?...well 

1) Naval/air combat is abstracted to various card plays rather than being an integral part of the game. In world war I air and naval power were much less important than land power, so this is fine. In WWII, allied air superiority in France in 44-45, made German attacks impossible(e.g Mortain) except during bad weather(e.g Bulge), and severly restricted defensive mobility. Also in 1941-42 control of the Meditteranean was disputed by the Luftwaffe transferring large numbers of aircraft to the theatre. Yes this can be represented by cardplay but it is dependant on the card coming up at the right time - you don't get the choice to weaken one front of aircraft to strengthen another.  

2) Supply - in theory the POG supply rules are too brutal, this way cut off units have a chance of fighting their way out. In practise units swan about in completely a-historical ways. In one game I played I counterattacked the D-Day landings overunning the beachead isolating the Anglo-Americans. Undaunted they advanced to the Saar, while getting supply before the turn end by american armies advancing through Denmark. Divisions should be able to do stuff like that on an operational scale map, Armys with supply and service echelons should not be able to do things like that on a strategic level map.

c) Don't play cards in the right order and you don't get Russian Tank (Shock?) Fronts. Obviously know the deck, but this takes a few playings to button down, and has a big effect on the game.

d) All card driven games have inherent advantages and disadvantages by their very nature. Disadvantages like all the action concentrating on one front, and nothing happening on the others...the artificialness of having to choose between sr'ing, operations, replacements and events...it just grates more for this game.

It's not awful by any means, but just doesn't quite work.

1 play vs. Firestone.  I got beat badly.  It is rough for the Allies at first, and I didn't realize what I should do.  I don't think it was bad play as more of a lack of knowledge of what needed to be done.  Fun, fun game, ultimately disappointing as we ended very early due to my mistakes.

Fun, tense and full of historical flavor thanks to the cards. 
A great ETO game which you can play to conclusion in 6 to 10 hours !

Just upgraded my 1. edition to 2. edition thanks to some BGG files.

Recommended: download a summary of the special rules which appear/disappear every round. The info printed on the turn track on the map is far from enough in that regard. 
Also, there is a good rules summary in the files which is very useful when you have not played the game in a while.

Excellent game, right there with 'Paths of Glory'. The rules are even easier than PoG. You can play the whole war in one setting.

Update: Downgraded from 8 a 5. After repeated play, this is too long for what it is. No Retreat does the same much better and in less time. I'd also rather play PoG, which is more of a classic than this.

Wanted to like this game, but the more I play it, the more I despise it.  The Eastern Front just swallows up all the interesting elements.  There is just no reason to try and save a good invasion card- use it in the East!  It just doesn't really 'connect' the Eastern and Western theaters in any meaningful way- and most certainly doesn't have the Western theater be interesting to play in any sense.

But the biggest failing is that one is always reacting to the cards, never planning.  You just go from turn to turn, reacting to the events you have in your hand, rather than trying to lay the groundwork for future events by planning and logistical buildup.

The only good thing about BtB is that its inspiried me to finish my own game on WWII.  Now if I can get it published.....

The game is way too scripted and because it starts in the morning of 22nd June 1941, there are no real diplomatic options. 
But it simply is exciting to form a new line of defense after the initial german breakthrough, or to lead the slowly dissolving axis forces into the Soviet Union.
And last but not least it shows who really won the hard war against german aggression - the sturdy soviet forces.

This is my favorite card driven wargame.  It is basically an Eastern Front game, as the action in North Africa is really a sideshow.  Later in the game, if the Axis has not won an auto-victory, then the Western front comes into play, with other posibilites such as an allied invasion from Norway.  I think the game has a higher learning curve for the Axis player, as it is their game to lose.  

The game uses the same basic rules as Paths of Glory and Shifting Sands.  If you know either of those games this one is not too difficult to learn, and I think it is the easiest of the three to get into.

The game can easlily be played via ACTS, and I have had no trouble finding opponents.

I really enjoyed this game the first couple of plays, but its rating has dropped in my eyes.
a) Its too unbalanced in favour of Axis autovictories
b) Attempts to balance it are extremely fiddly (with cards having special properties under multiple different conditions).
c) Each player has one period of attack, then defence (or viceversa), then its over. Compare this with the continuous attack & counterattack of PoG.

RATING: 8
Did have trouble getting some of the rules straight - particularly around units taking losses/corp's replacement and recreating units from the elimnated units box. Even now that I understand the loss factor stuff it does not feel intuitive and I think the rule book needs some detailed worked examples in it - I suspect if you had played 'Paths of Glory' first, which I hadn't, then it would have been easier. Underneath lies a fairly straightforward rule set with most of the complication coming from 'special' rules for particular units and certain turns - unfortunately the first turn is one with many special rules which doesn't therefore help to ease you into the game.

These niggles aside once you are up to speed, this is a great game - loads of tough choices, with the cards driving a realistic but variable historic framework without leaving you feeling you are straight-jacketed to what actually happened. If you are interested in WWII and want a strategic level game of the ETO this is one of the best - although as the name implies it does not cover the early blitzkreig's in Poland or France. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For some reason the game feels less exciting than PoG for example. I think it's the lack of fronts. In PoG you have do divide your attention and resources between at least 4 different fronts, here it's mostly about the east front with Africa as a sidekick.

After trying it out another time I lowered my rating. This game is simply too controlled by the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Son-of-PoG, this game appears to have ported the basic mechanics across, added a few neat features for mechanized movement, and upgraded the deck to World War II.  In the end, the tweaks and rule changes makes the text on half the deck obsolete, and the game play rather event driven.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
While the idea of a WW2 card-driven game really appeals to me, this game appears to be of a warmed-over PoG.  

The sides do not play as differently as they ought to in my opinion, and lots of odd situations pop up as soon as something falls off the narrow game script. Fails to capture mobile warfare, which defined WW2.

Great game. Lots of decisions to make, and real tough for both sides, although probably more tough for the Axis. The historical modelling is slightly better here compared to Paths of Glory but I get the impression that B2B is more sensitive to card sequencing than PoG, probably because of the game designer's attempt to make the game follow a more historical path than PoG.

RATING: 7
Certain problems really keep me from truly enjoying this game:

1) The scripted "Chain of Events" - There are several multiple-step sequential sequences of cards that must be played to permit you to take certain actions or to gain certain benefits.  You could have Moscow (or Leningrad, or Stalingrad) completely overwhelmed, but be unable to directly attack the city because you couldn't play a certain card.

2) If the German player conserves his armor and plays nothing but Ops in the first year of the game, it is VERY difficult for the Russian player to survive / win.  It also makes things INCREDIBLY boring for the Russian player as he is (understandably) completely reactive in the first year...largely playing cards to rebuild the units he's losing.

Provisional rating until such time where I can try my hand another time.  While most CDG's give you a feeling of immense possibilities where every choice is engaging, I didn't quite get the same with BtB.

I will play again, but I will read up more on suggested strategies because I was hopeless at my first go.

My biggest problem with the game is that it really can't recreate the historical course of the war. Competent Germany will take Moscow no matter what and in the winter 41-42 the lack of troops forces Allied player to retreat deep into the Motherland.

RATING: 7
A good game,
not exceptional.
The problem is the nuber of cards that must be played to make the game go on.
And you must play them at first opportunity, if you skip then you will certainly loose, and thats bad in my opinion.
This is particulary true for the allied player.
You have to play many cards one turn after the other, if you draw them all togheter you have to take 1OPS to keep them in your hand and thats really bad.
But anyway its a game worth playing sometime.
And it gives a good feeling of WW2 in europe.
Another thing i dont like its the magical way that russian army appears on the map, you play a reinforcement card and 4 army appers in Russian Cities for example.
just my 2 cents

I think that this Raicier game is a lot better that Paths Of Glory.  It took me a while to get into the rules but once in, it was great.  At the beginning the Germans have the upper hand, but slowly but surely, the Allies come on strong.  I feel that it is almost impossible for the Axis to keep any part of Africa, but also, I found, once the Germans are deep into Russia it's hard to extract them.  In my opinion, the Neutrals, Turkey and Sweden are almost worthless.  One of the hardest things for me to grasp is the Victory Point system.  Both Axis and Allies start out with some VP cities, that in my opinion, don't seem to mean a lot.  If this part of the game was revised I would give the game a 10.  BTB is worth having and it's a lot of fun.

I have come to realize that an efficient Barbarossa invasion is difficult to pull off, especially against competent Soviet players and this game is no exception.  If the Allies hold off the German AV, the game will come down to a very tense ending.  The mid-game has some tough decisions for both sides: 1) when to the Germans stop the offensive and where to go defensive and 2) when do the Soviets seriously start the offensive. To early or too late will have long term consequences.  Great Game

La segunda incursion de Ted Raicer en los juegos de estrategia con cartas tras su brillante y exitoso "Paths of Glory". Aqui adapta el sistema a la Segunda Guerra Mundial en Europa, a partir de la Operacion Barbarroja (ataque aleman a la URSS) en Junio de 1941.

El juego es bueno, pero no tan redondo como su predecesor. Prueba de ello son los numerosos cambios en reglas, mapa y cartas que el autor ha introducido en la version publicada originalmente. En mi opinion la mayoria son correctos, pero algunos favorecen en exceso a los Aliados.

Los principales problemas del juego derivan de la existencia de solo dos mazos de cartas (Paths of Glory tiene tres), lo que provoca un insuficiente reciclaje de eventos, y de la incapacidad del juego para simular correctamente algunos aspectos de la guerra: Norte de Africa, desembarcos aliados...

No son problemas insalvables. El juego es excelente y esta bien equilibrado entre bandos. Creo que su puntuacion en BGG es demasiado baja.

[i]Paths of Glory[/i] template applied to World War II in Europe. I bought the game in 2007 from GMT, but it appears they sent me the version 1.3 rules. Regardless, I'm disappointed in the game. It is gamey in the sense that moves are rigid, such as the inability to make Antwerp a port unless you play a certain card. This hasn't hurt me, but I can just see it crushing a session.

Card draws are so important to the game, that they truly dictate your actions. Also the card events are so important but if you use them you lose high OPS values. What makes this especially problematic is that most of the events are historical. The biggest problem is along the Western Front, where Africa is a dull theater and invasions are scripted events, easily suppressed by a skillful defense. 

Where this game shines is on the Eastern Front, where the [i]Paths of Glory[/i] system makes sense. It is here that the war is won, and all the fun of the game can be found as armies thrust and parry, and mass offensives are carried out. Maybe what we needed from Ted was strictly an Eastern Front game? In the end I think [i]Rise and Decline of the Third Reich[/i] did a better job. I do like that this game starts after the quick victory campaigns of 1939-41.

A good evolution of the Paths of Glory system.  Not quite as good.  For one thing, there's a lot of extra chrome which can be quite a burden.  Secondly, some of the issues of scale can be a little weary.  However, what it lacks is more than made up for in WWII accuracy.  The war is truly decided in Russia in a lot of ways.  The Germans can win an "attritional" victory (through play of Totaler Krieg).  All in all, a worthy game and quite fun at that.

Please, oh, PLEASE don't throw me in that briar patch, Br'er Rinella!

"That which is not forbidden is mandatory!" This script needed a much better editor; So determined to replay history that it's not historical at all. An absurd level of designer micromanagement (much worse than Paths of Glory) in which here you MUST play a card to bring a specific army to it's historical location and can only use it to perform its historical function regardless of how gameplay may have taken the flow of events away from this line of action. This game was broken from the get-go, "fixed", found to be still broken and re-patched.

If the uninitiated reading this think I'm exagerating they should check the positive reviews from people who actually like this dog remarking on how the multiple rules overhauls aren't really that bad and that they don't mind the stickers all over the cards trying to keep up with the adjustments.

   Berlin to Barbarossa isn't bad; it's exciting, just like most of Ted Racier's designs.  But there's just not enough for the Axis to do, except maybe take down the Soviets, and then stave off defeat.   The Western Allied force that gets ashore after Overlord seems remarkably fragile.

Took a hard knock when first came out (all the complex CDWs do) due to a number of factors: the 14 straight German OP strategy, little PZ  corps that could OOS the entire Russian army, etc. A number of sharks helped improve it and Mr.Raicer made some smart revisions. Get the 2nd edition. Overall very impressive given that there have been so few playable WWII Europe Grand Strategy games - at this scale (about 12 hours for two experience wargamers).

Not as good as its predecessor, Paths of Glory, but also not nearly as bad as a lot of people seem to think it is.

The good news is that the system makes strategic level WWII playable with a simple rule set and an achievable playing time.

The bad news is that the system achieves its simplicity by ignoring or heavily abstracting pretty much everything aside from manoeuvring and engaging ground forces at corps or army level. 

The game looks and feels a little dated relative to more recent and more adventurous CDG designs but it's certainly a step up from Axis & Allies type stuff while still being infinitely more approachable than monster games like World in Flames. Overall this is pretty enjoyable provided you're not expecting more than the game was designed to deliver.

A great development out of the POG system.  The use of Yellow dual action cards, and mechanized units greatly increases the tempo of operations in this game.  This creates a great tension where each player thinks they will lose at any moment.  The game nicely covers the end of the war which most strategic games don't.

I'm not the first to mention that BtB feels too scripted. Not being able to attack certain areas until one gets a certain card; being hampered (somewhat artificially) in others; and many other restrictions make one feel as though one is re-playing a session report as opposed to playing a game. All that being said, it is a fun replay and gives a good feel for the period.

does not work for us. 

I can clearly see that system for Shifting Sands were inspired here. However there it works much better and in our view creates narative of campaign better than here. Also it is little bit unfortunate that here are mashed together three fronts in one deck which creates bizarre situations when you can have all events for battlefields where you are not playing yet.

I was hoping for good CDG Europe game however this was big fail for us.

RATING: 7
This rating reflects my first impressions after two plays.  I enjoy the ways in which small modifications to the Paths of Glory system have sped up the action and given this game a very different feel despite sharing many mechanics with its WWI predecessor.  I enjoy how the Axis begins the game with two major strategic options.  As with Paths of Glory, some of the chrome rules are difficult for me to memorize (as I play most  games too infrequently to digest rules exceptions thoroughly) and so I rank this below some more streamlined CDGs.  I would have preferred some shorter scenario options as well.  Our second game also devolved into a in/out of supply seesaw between Germany and Russia that was unsatisfying and felt a bit "gamey" to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is the game I reckon I have played most often. I love it and I hate it. Love it for the great card-driven system and associated choice limitations. Hate it for too-powerful German initial offensive and strong scripting, but yet I keep coming back to play it...

RATING: 9
A card-driven strategic scale WW2 is surely a hot cake in the pan.  Eat it fast or it will melt away.  I do not know how good Path of Glory is 'cos I am not interested in WW 1.  But WW2.....could be a great game. Point-to-point movement now flourishes more than the hex-based wargame.  Control the cards and you control the fate.  Quite unimaginable back then in the 80's or 90's wargaming community.

Based on one play.  Loads of things to choose from, but there is a little bit of the feeling your moves are scripted- meaning you are forced by the cards to play a certain way.

CDG that concentrates on the Soviet-German conflict of WW2 with Africa and the West Front as sideshows.  A good game with a violent initial blitzkrieg that is hard to take for the Soviets.  Mr Racier did a great job of modeling the initial push and the subsequent wearing down of the German war machine.  It does feel a bit scripted to me, but nevertheless I do enjoy the game.  Same system as Paths of Glory, Shifting Sands, et cetera so not a huge learning curve here.

RATING: 7
Disclosure:  I was a playtester.  By BGG criteria this is a 7:  "Good game and usually willing to play."  The primary things holding the game back from a higher rating, in my opinion, are that the design is trying to do too much with just 55 cards per side, and it can take a very long time (8 or more hours) to play.  I prefer - and design - games to be played in 4 hours or less.  Still, a very worthy post-Paths of Glory card-driven game.  2014 update:  an interesting variant appeared in the first issue of War Diary magazine.  2016 update:  my card-driven design Festung Europa depicts the war in the west at a finer grain than this game, which is mostly focused on the eastern front.

Exciting and epic, I don't feel it as being too scripted rather it has a nice balance of historical accuracy and gameplay accessibility. Has its pros & cons vs. PoG so to me they are even. Maybe not the best ETO but an excellent game on its own.
[2nd edition, v1.3 rules] 

Cons: a wonderful gaming experience, but the lack of support (official FAQ, gameplay examples, historical/design notes, unexplained terminology) leave a bad taste in my mouth, exp. compared with what PoG has received. The more I play it, the less I'm tolerant of this "[i]let's support the new/what sells well[/i]" attitude. Do I have to scan the consim threads to find out what I need?

Disappointed in WWII: Barbarossa to Berlin. Takes much of the framework from Paths of Glory (which is an incredible game) but continually falls short in comparison.

Revised edition was necessary because card play wasn't well balanced initially, but the revised edition removed many of the decisions from how cards should be handled by making many dual-action (OPS+Event). Timing and maneuvering are still important, but you end up playing a game that is far less flexible than it's predecessor.

Not a horrible card-driven game, but (outside of theme) why would you ever play this when Paths of Glory exists? Can't think of a reason, so can't rate it any higher.

After several plays, I find this game to be a consistent system that allows for "what-if" scenarios but never wanders too far off the historical timeline.  If you've ever wanted to play a game meatier than Axis and Allies, but lighter than the Avalon Hill games of yesteryear, than this is where you should start.  In fact, I would be inclined to pick this game over "Paths of Glory" as Ted Racier has had time to perfect his system since PoG.  I can't wait for his next one!

RATING: 9
A long grand strategy game covering the WWII European Theatre.  The game takes a while to play but the enjoyment and tension is sustained throughout with every decision feeling important; from small manoeuvres to big strategic decisions. I really like the way that if the Axis push into the Soviet Union runs out of steam (and a German autowin becomes impossible) then the objectives for both sides change, with the Soviets mobilising their forces and the Germans switching to defence and damage control. This turning point really makes the game for me, as both sides scramble to shift their strategy. One minor complaint is that the game feels heavily scripted, but I'm not sure this would become a flaw unless you were to play it a lot - and with such a long play time I can't see this becoming a problem for me.

WW2BtB covers four years from June 22, 1941 to 1945.  The winner is usually decided in the last turn or two between competent players.  The 110 Action cards system adds all sorts of goodies such as Events, Operational Moves, Combat, Strategic Moves, Replacements, etc.  See if you can drag Turkey in on your side?  The Guderian Card is an "ace in the hole" for the Germans but supposed the Allies draw the Torch Card?  Very fun and unpredictable.  Ted Raicer again exceeds expectations.

If you can lock the rules away in your mind, this becomes a fascinating game. It’s essentially the Russian front, then toss in Africa, then toss in a French invasion to stretch the Nazi’s. The game has a decent pace and I enjoyed watching my bad plays unwind and my good plays reap reward. I eventually traded it away because of the rules complexity and game length, even though I very much enjoyed the game (preferring the shorter CDG's and block games).

Update: I've pushed this from a 6 to a 9. I've got over my errata-induced sulk, and B2B now one of my very favourite wargames. The only ETO game I've come across that is possible to play in a reasonable length of time. I love playing the allies and figuring out the location and timings of your amphibious invasion options.

---
Big disappointment - the rules were an ever-moving target when I was trying to learn the game. Got sick of putting yellow stickies on the cards and trying to keep up with the errata. Even so - the premise (WW2 in a day) is a hook so will probably give it another try some day.

RATING: 8
The card driven mechanism works remarkably well in driving the game and there are plenty of crucial decisions for each player to make on each turn or even each card. All the drama of the war in the east is here with enough control given to the player for the sideshow events (Africa, Normandy) to make things very dynamic. 
I bought this one mainly for solo play, expecting to be disappointed and it turned out to be absolutely perfect. Requires, however, that you have a table where you can leave it set up for a week or two.

This is a tough one as I like Ted's designs but I really don't like "card-driven" games very much.  This one fell apart a couple of times (we played it before a number of "fixes" were published) on us.  There is a nice simplicity to it...but the eastfront was a little to slippery and in general the card mechanic felt very awkward (as always).

A well-crafted game that moves much faster than I’d expected it to. A full playing would be about ten hours, which is a little long for my tastes, but that’s no reflection on the quality of play. The excision of the early part of the war is a nifty idea that prevents late-war wackiness. Rather, the game faithfully tramlines the players to historical events. On the downside this means the game doesn’t give you the whys or wherefores of the war. However, it does provides a solid game experience and cuts out a lot of crap, boiling the war down to its essentials of combat and manoeuvre.

I like the theme and the mechanics to this game. But the exceptions and what seems to me to be a vast number of things I simply have to memorize (like both decks of cards!) can devastate my game when forgotten. A few more simple on-map reminders and a few indicators on cards of other pre-requisite cards would make this game much more enjoyable for me. I will get back to this one sometime, but it is going sit on my shelf for a while until I either compile a list of "Things to Remember" or forget how frustrated I am right now and try it again.

I have only tried a few turns only so the rating may change.  Initial impression is positive, but it is no POG.  One problem is the errata:  It takes me long time to stick yellow labels to include the corrections in the cards.  The map is not as nice as the one in POG also.  The space does not show the initial setup units and side control, thus taking me long time for initial setup.  A complete review will follow later.

RATING: 1
Unbalanced as published, but new living rules don't go far enough to fix it. The sequence of card draw can make or break a game. The Allies have too many must play as event cards in the early game, while the Axis don't really have any.

A poor card draw cannot be salavaged by skillful play and there is no fog of war because if you're not playing those cards when you need them, your opponent knows that you don't have them, and then it's game over (usually for the Allies).

Unhistorical. German panzers can roam too freely and the correct Allied defense is to fall back on the Urals and wait it out in spaces unenterable by the Axis.

Rules are also loosely written with few examples. Too many clarifications are needed. 

After playing in 4 tournaments and over 35 games, I have concluded that this game is now unsalvageable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As well done as Paths of Glory. The card deck gives enough options to provide some variations but generally follows the historical time lines. 
There is always more things that need to be done than you have cards to do, and some turns have to be used to rebuild your position.

In a recent game my son use sledgehammer and antwerp to get the 2nd front opened early, but the germans were able to turn the enclave into a battle of attrition. It turned out the severely constrain his actions in Africa and the Mediterranean - but that would be accurate.

A later game had the Germans deep in Russia late while the Allies were besieging Hamburg and sweeping up from the Med. Never thought that the Romanian and Bulgarian surrender should include the allies, instead of just the Russians.

As my first real exposure to card-driven games (other than a single playing of Age of Napoleon) I was pleasantly surprised by Barbarossa to Berlin. I expected that I might have issues with the game feeling too scripted, or the oddity of major events occurring in a unusual sequence (or not occurring at all), or the fortune-teller effect of knowing what will happen in the future (because I'm holding that card in my hand)... but instead I found the game a blast to play, and the sense of historical realism was pretty good. I like the elegant simplicity of the combat system. The limitation of having to activate a space for either movement or combat, combined with the requirement that you must start adjacent to the enemy in order to attack, creates an intricate and challenging gameplay. One noticeable difference from other games that cover the war in Russia is that you can capture and lose vast amounts of territory in Russia without it having any effect on the production capability of either Germany or Russia. Judged strictly as a historical simulation, BtB has a number of shortcomings... but as a simple yet challenging game, it's quite good.

The little brother of PoG. Unlike PoG this one has one dominant front (major downside). The fact that Ted designed Stalin's War means that he didn't get all the east front action in to this game he wanted, I think.

World War 2 is my favorite period to game, and a strategic level game with cards for events felt like the perfect game choice.  I had fun playing the game but felt the card play was a little forced.  You get it you play it, pretty simple card play IMO and it lacked the tension I've read about other CDG's possessing.  The good thing is not as many cards as other games have pre-requisites.

The game really magnified the eastern front and almost ignored the med front.  One game I played the axis never spent an OP in N Africa or Italy for that matter.  The western front almost became forced, the game was all but decided in the east. 

In the end I liked it and would play it again if asked, but will never see myself seeking a game.

Another great CDG from GMT. BtB is the sibling to Path of Glory and the systems are almost identical. You have the same agonizing decisions on every turn and the game is IMO very balanced. The outcome is often decided on the last turn if played by two equally skilled players. There are a lot of things to like in this game. One thing I think Ted Racier has succeeded very well with is to portrait transition of the Soviet war machine from inefficiency to efficiency. Highly recomended.

Was suffering from development problems (many errata). The second edition has amended those problems.
It's more tactical than its predecessor Paths of Glory. There is almost no deck management and most cards are played for OPs anyway.
The first three turns are among the most exciting that you will ever find in this hobby. The end game, however, is not that interesting as it often comes down to how many sixes the Soviet player can roll.

A great counterpart to Paths of Glory.  Barbarossa to Berlin is a great game showing the flow of WWII from 1941 to 45.  Although it's missing the intensity of a multi-front combat like Paths of Glory, the back and forth fight over the eastern front is busy enough!  Many people complain that this game is so centered on the eastern front and the other theaters are a sideshow, but WWII was like that.  Most everything happened in the east.  So I see this game as a good representation of the conflict.

This is the only Ted Raicer game I would ever say this about, but this game is bloody awful. Suffers from the two-front CDG problem (e.g. the Americans in France can't move a single piece because the Russians are fighting too many battles in Poland) but takes the downside of that basic system to new further-downs. My favorite is the Operation Husky rule that involves what is essentially an invasion from outer space... you don't have to control North Africa to invade Sicily. The troops just pour out of the sky. And you MUST use the card to invade Sicily; Patton (and his army) will never appear anywhere else on the board! And then there's the bit about gigantic pockets of troops on the Eastern Front holding on for months. This game is impossibly bad.

One of the best card driven games.  There was a fair amount of errata to get us to the current state of the game, and for this I knocked the rating down 1.5 points out of frustration of 'changing rules' for a period of time.  If I had picked the game up as it currently stands, with all errata included into the rules, I would have given it a 10.

Using the Paths of Glory rules essentialy, this CDG should be easily accessible to most war gamers. The exceptions are not as numerous as in PoG, making this easier for a newcomer to grasp.

Great game, very playable and (relatively) clean, tons of tension and that feeling of being right on the knife's edge.

A few issues here and there.  Barbarossa plays out strangely.  The movement-to-map space ratio is off, creating occasional bizarre situations. The scripted early turns are always tense, but it's the same puzzle every time.  Variable setup or a few more VPP-ish cards would've helped a lot. The RP/Ops dilemma is too unnatural (tying back to Barbarossa), creating odd "die and recreate" decisions that don't map to any reality.

But still, a lot to like here. Not at PoG's level, and I think Raicer would've been well-served to shake up the formula a bit more than he did, but still good stuff.

RATING: 4
I've now played this game 4 times and find the big problem with it is the card activation system fails here where it worked superbly with Paths of Glory and For The People. WWI had the disjointed operations caused by political disconnects that makes the initiative effect of the card play more realistic to the war's events. The American Civil War also suffered from disconnected political command control issues similar to the WWI effect that was cross international alliances.

But in WWII, the Germans were able to sustain initiative on more than one front at a time, and then the Allies were able to take initiative on nearly every front. Card play that can balance things in your favor for initiative on one front can force your opponent's play to that front. So they can't build up on other fronts until your initiative peters out completely due to lack of useful cards. It's not that easy to have. The German player often can overwhelm the Soviets early if the Allied player fails to match him on that front due to this initiative effect.

I was interested in this game until I'd gotten to the point where it was obvious the play had a more or less formula that dealt with that initiative problem and then just followed a more or less scripted pattern. 

It's obvious thought went into the game, it just fails one of the tests I have for playing a game. If I find I'm playing against the game system instead of against my opponent, I generally don't enjoy it as much as I do when once the rules are absorbed it becomes me versus the guy across the table. Even after I got the rules down in this one, I was still playing against the game instead of my opponent. A sadly unintended thumbs down.

A better, further cleaned and evolutionized game than Paths of Glory, but knowing PoG is a prerequisite for playing due to the incomplete rule book. Sadly under-appreciated and unsupported. Heavily balanced to the eastern front, but that is not the flaw as some say.

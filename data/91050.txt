A really novel setup for a game: a light RPG-ish, Euro adventure game.  It seemed a little unbalanced.  You have no way of directly affecting your outcome.  You're almost completely at the mercy of your opponents to create paths for you.  Too bad, as it was a good idea.

RATING: 5
Monster cards aren't very interesting, and resources feel a touch too scarce to me.  There's little interesting in the mechanics of "play cards in very specific locations, then take whichever path has cards you can afford to cross".

Some of the cards have nice art, though.

Basically, it's a hand management game with the goal of collecting the most points.  The route-building mechanic just creates temporary routes used to move from point to point (like using rocks as stepping stones to cross a puddle), and you never build a network since you don't own any of the cards on the board.  You have an adventure party of up to 5 characters that can be "leveled up" during the game.  Note: once you hire a character into your adventure party, you are stuck with him for the entire game (he cannot be killed, fired or traded).  You get points when your characters achieve their life ambitions (e.g., encountering coastal monsters) and points from hidden treasure cards, but you can only have one treasure per character in your adventure party (and it must be the correct "flavor" of treasure, e.g. wealth item for a merchant, sword for a warrior, etc.).

There is a heavy luck of the draw element, and you could get stuck with a bunch of the same color cards, limiting your options for building routes (thus it is largely a hand management game).  The character development was rather dull... they aren't that jazzy, and leveling them up to level 2 of 3 doesn't make them stronger for fighting monsters... it only changes your trade-in ratio for converting the white "will" cubes into victory points.  It's not until the 3rd and final character level that you get to choose an interesting special power.  The game felt fun for a while (with all of us bopping around, carefully hiring our 5 adventurers since they can never be changed, and leveling up characters), but it ended on a very sour note, and the reasoning is best described by the situation outlined below.

In a 3p-game, we were all stuck in a catch-22...we all ended up on the same space on the board... but to get away from one another we had to play a card to the board to serve as a stepping stone across a puddle... however, with only one action per turn, if we played the card as our action, the next guy would take advantage and move over the puddle sinking the stone, leaving us without a stepping stone... and then we would have to waste another turn to play another card, hoping to free ourselves... but more than likely the 3rd player standing on the shared space would screw us over and use our stepping stone.  In the end, one player had a secret "fly anywhere" card which he used to get away and left me and player 2 stuck on the shared space to figure out who would blink first.  In the end, the 2 of us probably should have made a deal on how to get our pawns moved amicably so we could give the 3rd player a run for his money... instead we just turtled.  One player was so infuriated over this game design flaw that she made herself hoarse and then refused to play more games that night.  Sigh.

Others say: Trying to pay attention to fine print and character/monster abilities slows the game down, and it's slow enough as players have a hard time deciding what to play because their opponents might take it first.  (BGG user dr glaze et al) sums up my feelings fairly succinctly... A game which features hand management to seed the board with challenges. You attempt to set up situations which are favorable to your pawns yet not to your opponents. But every player has an opportunity to act on the set-up before you do. This leads to lots of fretting about what you're putting out there. Overall a curious exercise, but hardly a fun game.

This is actually pretty fun... for 30 minutes. The moment all players have basically "powered up" their party to the point where they can defeat basically everything, the game becomes completely unchallenging and unfun. I think a small tweak to make the game end a bit sooner, or to make the monsters harder to defeat later in the game (and thus provide more incentive to keep recruiting), would improve this immensely.

Venture Forth is a pretty unique game; at least I haven’t seen those game mechanics in any other game, so that was pretty cool. However, I didn’t really like the mechanics and I think they were contra intuitive in the way to get prestige for your heroes. I made a mistake early on which kind of screwed me as I spent a couple of turns recovering, so that sucked but probably wouldn’t happen again in future plays when I know how to play.

I think I will probably like Venture Forth more if I played it again and knew about the strategy and how to play, but I doubt there will be a second time. At least I will not buy the game myself, but I would perhaps play it again if asked, just to confirm my feelings about the game. Still, there are SO many better games out there I would much rather play.

Players are adventures in ancient Greece, recruiting followers, and exerting their will to try and complete adventures.  This is a different game - on their turn, players take an action which is either seed the board with a card (gaining a resource), offering at a temple for some sort of ability/exchange, passing to refresh their hand, or venturing forth.  The seeding cards fills in a path between two locations with monsters and/or potential recruits.  Venturing forth means the hero crosses the path from end to end, encountering every cards in the path.  Recruits can be hired or ignored, monsters must be fought.  You get nothing for defeating a monster, but if you are defeated you lost resources.  Resources are gold (for recruiting), willpower (for doubling strength, or leveling up) and despair (sort of anti-willpower).  Really nice blend of adventure game and resource management.  The components are well done.  The game may be a little too long, and begins to feel slightly old as you run down the end of the game, but that's a nitpick - this is a nice design.  Good if you're in the mood for something different.

Its an interesting idea, milling around the wilderness gathering a party of adventurers who all have different goals and battling wandering monsters, however it doesn't really work very well. 

All of the cards are so very similar that there really is no hand management here and seeding the board with encounters might as well be random. 

There is a really slow start, whereby your adventurers are too weak to actually do anything and suddenly your adventurers jump in level and can pretty much beat up EVERYTHING, so there is no longer any risk.

Card stock is very thin and there should have been many more will cubes especially included in the box. Its a shame because the concept is good unfortunatly execution is poor

Played this after getting a copy for Beyond Monopoly! at Essen 2011. Rules seem excessively complex for a simple strategy game. I really enjoyed it but one of my friends asked to stop part-way through. I saw lots of potential though and want to play it fully. Small cards, small text, small icons, poor rules set, but a nice game lurks there. Well worth checking out.

Nem sok jót vártam tőle a játék előtti beharangozó alapján, de kellemeset csalódtam. Kicsit Hansa Teutonicas utánérzésem volt, de ez egyáltalán nem baj nálam. :)
Kalandozókat mozgatunk helyszínek között, de előtte ehhez a helyszínek közti világot fel kell töltenünk szörnyekkel és NPC-kel, ami tulajdonképpen kártyák. Aránylag gyors játék, amiben azért szerintem kicsi a szerencse szerepe, de bőven akad gondolkodnivaló. A többiek szintlépési feltételeit nem könnyű lekövetni 3-4 játékosnál.

A hidden gem that was quite misunderstood and ignored down the road. This is an excellent and tight tile laying euro with good thematic ties to the adventuring theme, unique gameplay elements are in this game. I like how the game is so simple to play but at the same time you have to think hard and optimize your play to do well. Furthermore, the game does reward you for proper decisions and good timing. It is not as random as some people have claimed, you have a good amount of control (especially 2 players) and you can do some planning ahead.

This one is very good if you enjoy light-medium eurogames. I play with 16 explore tokens and the play time is just perfect, not too long and not too short, about 1 hour.

The game is about having a party of adventurers that venture between temples fulfilling goals. In a turn, you either play a card to the board (which some player can encounter later), go between temples or use the special ability on the temple you stand on. It felt pretty different, but not as exciting as I hoped it would be. There were also some lockups in our game which felt frustrating. It have the Munchkin problem where it is really hard to win the first battles (which is not necessary but advisable), but too easy at the end of the game.

A mechanically and thematically inventive layer (build a team of heroes with different ambitions, and try to fulfill their emotional needs as efficiently as possible with limited chances to go adventuring!) on top of some bargain-bin Euro mechanics like the treasure-to-points conversion at end of game.

If I ever play this again, it'll be with the 'advanced' side of the board; if I never do, it'll be because a 2p first play somehow took 2.5 hours and I can't promise anyone it's worth the time investment, not because it's bad as such.

Also, in a game that delights in finding emotional resonance in little details of dungeon crawling ([b]this[/b] character wants to fight two monsters in a row, while [b]that[/b] one wants to fight a weak monster while somebody else is watching), I was disappointed at how interchangeable the monsters themselves were-- basically just colors and numbers. (They also vary in the toll they exact if you can't defeat them, but I think even that was more heavily-patterned than I expected.)

RATING: 7
Was pretty fun on the first play.  Seemed far too long; it'd get a little faster with more plays but there are still a LOT of turns in the game.  My other main complaint is that I kept getting stuck with a hand full of cards that couldn't be used for anything at all, but it's possible that with more experienced players, the board isn't almost entirely full all the time.  I can't really think of anything else that it's like.  There aren't a lot of reasonable options on any given turn but there's enough tactical depth that you still feel kinda smart when you pull something cool off.

I enjoyed this lighter RPG board game. The variety of adventurers adds to the atmosphere of the game. VF plays a couple of RPG elements a little different: 1) adventurers each have their own goals, instead of banding together for a greater cause and 2) defeating monsters doesn't directly benefit the party/player, although it does prevent them from losing resources. In fact, defeating a monster is sometimes as expensive as losing to it.
While the card art is decent, I felt the board art was merely functional, lacking some final touches that would have made it look pristine.

A quick playing adventure game that is fun and easy to learn. Recruit a party of adventures, each one having his or her own goal that must be achieved in order to score points and to increase the adventurer’s level. This is a very fresh take on the adventure genre, and does not play like any other game I have experienced before.

RATING: N/A
Interesting theme in Greek methodology, the struggle of men against the Gods-sent monsters and medusas. Some nice artwork conveying a good sense of the ancient mythos. Level up adventurers with treasures hunting sound great. 

Having watched the videos in the publisher's website, the gameplay seems to offer a lot more than I expected.  The players face a lot of choices: from the making up of the adventure party of members of different ambitions, the strategy of laying down the monsters along the path, collecting golds and will points, the treasure hunting of items matching the members' endeveaour to the level up to become more powerful a member, etc.  

It seems there is a game here. Now, if there are more maps that can be matching to one another, thus expanding the adventure areas more, more decisions to be made along the criss-crossing interactions among the players.

I really like Venture Forth and highly recommend it as an alternative to Talisman and similar style adventure games. The theme is refreshing, the time limit of about an hour is fantastic for those who want an adventure game with just enough meat and depth to keep them interested and enjoying the experience without losing a whole afternoon or longer. Yes, it is a bit light but its not looking to be anything other than what it presents itself to be.

This is not likely to be a satisfying enough game for the Decent fanboys but doesn’t need to be as it is more a very nice and reasonably easy entry point into adventure games and therefore much more accesible. it’s lighter than Descent and faster than Talisman with a much shorter time span with no worries about stats and geeky details. Everything is managed simply on the board and with the cards. I will definitely play this more often as its easy to set up and get into. The theme is interesting and different enough to keep me interested. It is a bit more serious in theme, lacking the humour and chaos of say, Guards! Guards! and humour and fantastical stuff of Talisman for that matter so it depends what you are looking for. There is a lot of unpredictability here in the enemies you will face and adventurers you will have to chose from which will keep things fresh too.

If you are a fan of Greek mythology and happy with an adventure game which you could introduce to non-gamers, you could do well with Venture Forth. Very nice, tight design, great theme, land ooks good. Light enough and not a huge time commitment. Absolutely works for me! Best game from Minion Games that I have played so far.

I thought this was pretty decent as I was playing, belying it's lower than expected ranking. It has a nice thematic feel to begin with, starting with a single adventurer and gradually adding more adventurers, where each adventurer has a different level up condition (eg defeat a mountains monster) which gives you lots of little mini-quests to fulfill. Leveling up gives you the VPs you need to win the game, and leveling up requires willpower cubes. Lots of white willpower cubes. To get those, you feed the board with monsters and adventurers (from your hand), earning gold and white cubes, and these monsters / adventurers are open to everyone to recruit / conquer. Combat is simple ... if your band of adventurers' fight strength >= the monster's strength, you defeat it, otherwise pay its penalty. No dice. No randomness. There are multiple turns laying out cubes earning gold and white cubes, followed by a turn doing a journey, the success of which can all be calculated out beforehand. Basically you do a journey if at has an adventurer you want to add to your party (increasing your combat strength and giving you new ways to level up) and/or it has monsters on it that meet one or more of your adventurer's level up requirements, and you spend those white cubes to level up and score VPs. The process repeats - lay out cards, earn white cubes / gold, journey to kill required monsters / add adventurers, spend white cubes to level up and earn more VPs. Repeat until the exploration tiles run out, which comes about 15 mins after the game should end (as your party's set, you can kill anything, it's just a matter of killing more stuff now). The cards are nicely done, but the board is a really bland disappointment that fails to deliver a more thematically gifted environment that would have provided a more satisfying vibe. It was too easy to slip into numbers mode rather than stay in the adventuring theme. Right, I need 4 white cubes, here's what I play to get them, then I'll kill this and this, etc. There's some tension in laying out stuff you want to kill yourself, hoping no one does it before you, but in the main you've got so many options and so many turns (within the 70 minutes or so that it takes), that even if you get beaten to something, your white cube investment will pay off in the immediate future on something else anyway. The other thing that detracts from theme immersion is that, in the end, it becomes a white cube collection game rather than a thematically driven fantasy adventuring game. If you want to do the Talisman / Runebound thing in an hour though, this is a pretty good option.

"Unique, creative, eccentric game. A bit too much screwage, leaching, and holding back for my tastes."

What I like:
- Adding adventurers to your party
- Not a huge penalty for failing to kill monsters
- Leveling up is neat
- Will and despair, and desire and ambition are all great thematic elements

What I don't like:
- Some ambitions suck (which you won't know at first)
- You have to be really patient, often just delaying
- No way to dump an adventurer from your party
- End game can bog down
- Our 3p learning game took over 90 minutes after rules/setup
- Level 2 sucks (1 is fine, and 3 is fine)
- Can be a bit of an early runaway leader

I was intrigued by this game, but knew it probably wouldn't actually work for me. To really do well, I think you need to throw obstacles at your opponents whenever possible, which I don't like. And you have to wait patiently to build up just the right situation, while hoping it doesn't get messed up, rather than just diving in. 

In my first game, I ended up arbitrarily choosing a starting adventurer whose ambition was really tough to fulfill. That set me back quite a bit, and I felt out of the game from the start. It turned out I wasn't actually that far behind, but it felt like I was. I also didn't realize the importance of the suits of your adventurers, nor the importance of getting a lot of tokens (even if you don't get the 2VP bonus). 

I would put the weight at 2.4, agreeing with BGG voters.

I liked the first part of the game, where you have to build your party of adventurers and have to think things over to avoid taking too much damage from the creatures. However the second half was rather boring as more parties have a strength of 10 or more, monsters are just a walk in the park. The game lasted too long, maybe less event tokens would help. Now it was boring for the last 45 - 60 minutes.

A resource management/engine building Euro cleverly disguised as an adventure game!

It's the resource management/engine building Euro that turns me off because it usually carries the baggage of low interaction.

As one commenter said, this game is all about putting obstacles in your opponent's way. Or more specifically, to put obstacles in your opponent's way that don't give him or her points. This means I have to pay attention to cards my opponents have played in front of them, which contain a lot of small text. I'm not going to hold up the game to do this, so the player interaction becomes inconsequential.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The whole game suffers from a sort of chaotic pacing as players will pretty randomly run around the board attempting to overcome challenges that are either way too difficult or, more likely, way too easy, especially in the last half of the game. Really, Venture Forth is very imbalanced, yet I find myself enjoying the simple mechanics and fantasy theme. It has a charm that's hard to define. Certainly flawed, but fun nonetheless.

This game has some clever ideas. I especially like how the ambitions create goals to reach. The game is a but puzzley at time. The biggest problem is that this game is kind of boring. The ramp up is kind of engaging, but by the mid point game it turns into a rinse and repeat race. I also was not a big fan of the thematic implementation. It is suppose to be an adventure game with euro sensibilities, it is mostly just euro sensibilities cube pushing. The theme and excitement is lost in the complete abstraction. The blah card art and really ugly board do not help that at all.

RATING: 10
A very different and interesting game which is un- classify-able.
It reminds me of retro PC rpg games, but still it is more euroish than ameritrash, and I dislike ameritrash. Very interesting game. Will play again soon. Also felt it worked well with two players.

1 play, 3er

This is an adventure game that's sort of like a combination of Fantastiqa -- where there are locations connected to by paths and you play stuff (obstacles, adventurers) on the steps of that path -- and Talisman-like games -- where you build a little adventure party and roam around the board doing stuff. It should play pretty quickly once you're familiar with the rules (and there aren't a lot of those!), but our first game seemed to last too long: the end just dragged as Mary sat there with nothing to do (since Brian and I were actively stalling her, keeping her from venturing forth and getting a bunch of VP).

The major downsides: 
- the game is a bit too long
- combat is nice and simple, but it's weird that you can eventually kill everything so easiliy
- also, odd that once your party is full it is pretty much unchangeable
- you can get stuck in a situation where you can't do much yourself, unless the other player(s) let you. If, for example, you end up in the same temple as another player, as soon as a path is full one of you will be able to venture forth. If it's that other player, then you're stuck sitting there trying to recreate that path; and when you're done, they can venture back -- again leaving you stuck sitting there, creating paths for the other player to take advantage of!

I'd like to try it again, but I don't think this will be a keeper for me.

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
The board shows several temple locations, and paths connecting them to each other. Shuffle the treasure and encounter decks. To start the game, players get coins and 6 cards (monsters and adventurers): in turn order, play one adventurer to your display (your party); these start as Level 1 (card indicators available as needed). In turn, place your pawn in different starting locations.

[u]On Your Turn[/u]
1. You MAY play a treasure card for its effect (a variety of powers: e.g., teleport to a location, convert coins to VP, etc.); it's then removed from the game. 
2. Then, you MUST take ONE action:
- Play a Card, then draw a card. The locations are color coded (e.g., wilderness, green). You may play a card onto a step on the path if it's adjacent to another card of that color, or the location itself. Depending on the icon on the step, you'll get either a coin or a will (white cube; place on one character in your party). You may also get to draw an adventure token and place on an available spot (one per path) on the board.
- Use a Temple (where you're standing). These allow you to buy will, sell a treasure card for coins, take TWO more actions (but not using this temple again), teleport to another temple, etc.
- Venture Forth. Once a path is completely full of cards, you may travel along it to the next location. At each step: 
... if you encounter an adventurer, you may add it to your party (max size 5) by paying the cost (coins) indicated. If you don't, tap it. If it was already tapped, discard it.
... if you encounter a monster, must equal or exceed it's strength to beat it; strength of each adventurer is the same as its cost, which you can double by having an adventurer spend one will -- just add up all your adventurer's strengths. If you lose, you must pay the penalty shown (coin, will, etc.) or take despair (black cube) for every item you cannot pay. The monster card is discarded.
... when you get to the other location, if there was an Explorer token on that path, take it: they generally give you coins, will, or treasure; may give you despair. Save for end-game scoring. 
... along the way, at any time you may fulfill one of your adventurer's ambitions (e.g., encounter a specific type of monster, travel to a specific location, etc.); if so, you may have that character spend will to earn VP or level up (which will later allow you to earn more VP at once). There are 3 levels in the game; Level 3 cards are unique, and split into 3 face up piles -- you choose which card to take (from the top) when you level up.
- Regroup. Discard as many cards as you want, draw as many back into your hand.

[u]End of Game[/u]
- When the last Explorer token is placed on the board, everyone (including that player) gets one more turn.
- Final scoring:
... adventurers may have end-game abilities to score VP
... Explorer tokens: most, 2VP; second-most, 1VP
... every 2 coins: 1VP
... each despair: -3VP

Interesting. Cardplay to create (shared) routes, and movement to recruit Heroes, acheive objectives, and slay monsters. Some tricky resource management issues as you go along - you need cash & Will, and should eliminate Despair.Suffers slightly from the dreaded "read upside down cards" syndrome, but it wasn't too bad. Not the sort of game that would have attracted my attention if I saw it in a shop, but I enjoyed playing and would gladly play again.

Neat character building/advancement, but a fairly mechanical point-to-point movement game. Worth a look.

Haven't played it yet, but for some reason I really like the art on the cards.  There's some imposing looking creatures.  My wife seems to hate the scantily clad female creatures, but they're fitting.  Can't wait to give it a try.

There's a strange scarcity of stuff in that it's easy to get a small amount of anything but hard to get more than 1 or 2 of anything at once. The different paths are certainly balanced but despite the different rewards based on the adventurers, it didn't really excite me.

It's not bad at all. Which is the nicest thing I have said about any Kickstarter original game so far. The others have had some decent ideas but were badly in need of development.

That being said, I think this game could still have used some professional development work. It works well enough, but there are some rough edges. There are not enough ways to get will, for example, so you spend too many turns making no decisions, just doing whatever will get you will. The endgame tends to be anticlimactic. Etc.

a quick-playing adventure game... you get to build up a party, level them up, fight monsters, and get treasure... but probably not in the way you'd expect.

It's puzzling seeing this sell for so little... anyway, grab one of 'em, while you still can.

A light and unique adventure game that also works great with 2 players! Turns are fast, but the game runs a bit long, using all of the Explore Tokens (so we use [size=9]½[/size] of them). There's nothing simple about the choices that you can make in this game. Inter-player screwage can be very high and then, there's a fair amount of luck involved (which can seem good, or bad, depending on whose turn it is). Extremely easy to set up/teach/relearn, even when coming back to it. Nitpicking a little here, but managing "Despair", is way too easy.

Really liked the unique feel of the game.  

I felt like the Adventuring party's goals was very strong in bringing out a story as we played.

Interesting "adventure" game unlike anything else. A bit strange and confusing at first but after some rounds we figured out how to actually play it and it has potential to be a good game.

This was much better than I thought it was going to be. The print-and-play version I tried could do with some graphical tweaking to make symbols and colours clearer. It's a mythological adventure game involving hand-management and careful timing of card placement. You want to set up good paths for you to venture across but at the risk of an opponent taking advantage of them first. I enjoyed the various personal goals each adventurer had and the fact that you could build your party as you went along and choose which of them to advance.

I am glad I own this game...it does fantasy adventure as a cube-pushing, point-gathering euro...the play is unique and I've enjoyed it so far, but it does feel a bit one-dimensional at times...it will grow tired faster than a normal adventure game (Runebound, etc.), so expansions will be needed...

Quite fun. And good to see a game that allows success through pacifist non-warrior characters.

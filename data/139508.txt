The game is theoretically drier than a desert in theme but it doesn't come across that way....it's a clear Knizia paste on but whether the components, colors, mechanics...something about it makes me not realize how dry it is as I'm playing. I had my butt handed to me on the first game...coming in at 60 points to my brothers both scoring just shy of 100, but I couldn't care less...it just felt so tight, so strategic...so many tough decisions of what to do and how. We played it the next day as well and it was only better....plays in under an hour yet packs a punch for that time.

It feels like a weird cross-pollination of El Grande and Masons, both of which are the far better games. I usually am a fan of area-control games, and this really is a fine attempt to get all that is good about area-control into one game with some novel mechanics thrown in for good measure: but what comes out is a needlessly complex abstract. Not that the game itself is complex! But it could have been a much, much better game if it were more streamlined: it just feels too clunky. 

Given how abstract it is, a much better idea would have been to abandon theme all together: subtitling a game either "Londonderry" or "Derry" is just asking for trouble! And having an orange background on the cover? What was the artist thinking? It makes the slave controversy in Five Tribes seem non-existent by comparison. 

Pretty looking game, though, in a cartoonish sort of way.

Fantastic game.  Really interesting choices all the way through the game.  The guilds add variation so there's lots of replayability.

I haven't seen the final version, put playtested the game several times.  The production looks fantastic from what I've seen, can't wait to get it!

For fans of area majority games, this game definitely provides a considerable multi-layered challenge.  With variable, player-defined areas and card play influencing placement rules, It felt to me like it incorporated elements of El Grande and Mexica, two very nicely designed area majority games.  How does this game compare? Related, but lesser I would say.

On the plus side, the card play felt reasonably fun to think about, as did the road placement phase which defined the areas to consider for majorities.  And worrying about those majorities was definitely urgent, front and center on the board so to speak.  On the minus side, overall, the game felt like it lacked rhythm and theme, and I was struck with the unusually dull, unattractive colors chosen for the citizen pieces.  Hmmm, perhaps these are thematic colors?

I generally like area control games, and this is a pretty good one. I like the structure of the game, with one round for establishing neighborhoods and another focused primarily on the towers, while balancing majorities for neighborhoods, factions, and towers. 

The fact that the neighborhoods are created by the players is a cool twist and makes for some fun decisions. I also like how the guilds work and the decision between getting stronger  cards and going late in the turn order is tough. The game plays smoothly and quickly. 

Some aspects of the game did bother me a little though, and maybe felt underdeveloped. Like El Grande, there is a hand management aspect to the game, as you are dealt nine cards that must be used once each throughout. Though unlike El Grande, how you manage your deck doesn't seem to have a ton of impact on the game. It's hard to know what cards will be valuable in the late game, and the cards are similar enough that it doesn't seem to make or break anything anyway. I never once grumbled about how I wish I still had a particular card.

Also, I love the idea that any unprotected knights flee at the end of the game and this could be a fun game of chicken to see who will protect who, but in practice (on the Londonberry board with 4 players at least) it doesn't happen. There are exactly two spots on Londonberry with 4 that don't get a wall. (I am worried about the Borderlands side a little since the neighborhood building with the Ts seems like it could be too chaotic, but I haven't played so not sure.) This seems like a great idea that just never gains traction. I also think this would add teeth to the decision of whether to play in neighborhoods that don't border a tower to avoid fleeing knights or round 2 placements while ceding any additional faction support.

All in all, I would love to play again on Borderlands, or maybe with 3 on Londonberry. This rating could go up quite a bit if that solves the issues mentioned above.

As ye olde school eurogamer, I like area majorities. It is too bad that the once important game mechanism is now shunned in favour of new shiny bling like deck building or worker placement. So when a game is released that utilises area majorities, I want to play it.

Sadly the experience was a bit of a let-down, summarised by 'too much of a good thing'. The authors have attempted to cram a sort-of gerrymandering idea into the game by not fixing the boundaries within which the majorities will eventually be tallied. They are created along with the influence making up the majorities. That is not really a problem—in fact, it is a novel twist—but when nearly all boundaries will be occupied at the end of the first year one has to wonder what the point to the entire mechanism was. Same with the walls in the second year: now there is a problem with fleeing nobles, but the pigeon hole principle ensures that most nobles either stay or become guards. To be honest, I have since learned that the reverse side of the board alleviates these issues to some unknown extent by simply having more spaces to build both roads and walls. But I think it a stupid idea to call the Londonderry-side 'the more straightforward' version then. 'Neutered' sounds more appropriate. 

But even so: the board at some point becomes a ghastly mess of influence clustering together all over the place. I had an unpleasant Aztlán-flashback at some point: not a good thing to have. To make it worse, there is an neighbourhood cross-cutting mechanism active which groups together different and quite possibly non-adjacent neighbourhoods. This idea is not novel—I know it is present in the old and forgotten 2 player-game Power & Weakness—but at least there matters are rather static, not subject to uncertain boundaries, certainly not to influence from 4 players at the same time, and visually small. It is tiring to keep tabs on what happens in the city; and if you don't you will lose to someone who can and does it better.

So The Walled City turns into this wild, eccentric ride where in a short time the game state goes from utterly unfixed to mostly fixed in 7 action rounds flat. I think that is overasking the players. A more gradual approach, with fewer influence placed each turn, more turns to make up, [i]and[/i] without annoying power cards changing the board state even faster, [i][b]and[/b][/i] a final mostly blind guess as to the value of the tower guards... the game would have been a lot more palatable. Alas, my name is not on the box, so I have to do with what I am offered. And I fear I'm not going to accept because of the above reasons. Which is a shame as I would have liked to own a new majorities game. I'm going to be a tad lenient on the game because of Josh Cappel's excellent efforts in creating the rule book, and because of having the cheek anno 2014 to create an area majorities game. But these plusses do not really solve nor make up for the above issues. The rate ought to be read as '3 + 1', which algebraically happens to makes '4'.

I really like this game.  It doesn't overstay its welcome, but definitely the Borderlands side of the board is the one to play.  While Londonderry is good just to get the mechanics down, I think the extra few options available on the Borderlands side just gives it that extra bump.

This one can be a pretty big brain-burner if you let it and can definitely suffer from AP.  One of the criticisms from one of the players was that there was a lot of counting involved, but while I can't dispute that, I find it's part and parcel of area-majority games anyway - that's kind of the point!  I love the swings that the faction dice can make and they are lovely to hold.  In fact, most of the components are pretty nice except if you look too hard at the board, you'll find that the artist pretty much scribbled around to make grass.

My biggest criticism is the choice of player colors.  Each of the four colors are ridiculous and very difficult to distinguish from one another.  While black has enough contrast with everything to stand out, the construction cards for black look like the construction cards for grey.  As for the pieces, grey, olive, and brown are just so earth-toney that it all blends together under certain light.  Put that all on the Borderlands side and you have more colors melting into each other.  This could have easily been fixed by using primary and secondary colors (blue, yellow, green, red), but perhaps there is a purpose in that it makes it harder to gauge, at a glance, where everyone is. Just seems like a really odd choice to me.

However, if you enjoy area control games, Walled City provides a lot of replayability by its use of faction dice for scoring - it's not chaotic, but it's just random enough to ensure no game plays the same.

The Guilds offer a lot of chaos, but also a lot of fun. You can mitigate the chaos with your group if you want by choosing less chaotic Guilds in advance. I like them a lot and think it keeps the game spicy!

I've played this 3 times now. It's an exceptional design that uses a mechanism that I've rarely seen used, and never this well: area control with player-created boundaries.

The rules are fairly simple, but the mind-melting strategy is intensely deep. It's just a tight, elegant design.

The artwork is ever so slightly playful, which has a strange way of keeping my analysis paralysis from taking over.

It reminds me somewhat of Tammany Hall, in that some aspects of the area control are not always immediately transparent. However, my complaint about the lengthy play time of Tammany Hall does not carry over to Walled City, as this title moves quite swiftly considering the depth of strategy (thanks in part to the included tokens to track the influence of the different factions, which keeps that information easily trackable).

I can't wait to play this more.

This is a very interesting game.  It is actually abstract and played in two phases.  It the first, roads are laid out which block create internal sections which are scored.  In the later rounds and you play a number of units in the areas which are nobles or peasants.  You then score those areas for 1st and 2nd place, where nobles break ties. You then place outer walls and your peasants and nobles will "run away" if not enclosed.  In each phase you can one special ability that is drafted from a group of all abilities.  

The game was surprisingly good.  It reminded me of Masons.  I would definitely play again an my rating would likely go up.

All art aspects aside (because I did the art), I really like this game. After you play it, you feel like you've been playing for a meaty two hours, then you look at the clock and see that only 50 minutes has passed. I mean this in a good way of course; Walled City packs a lot of gameplay into a tight timeframe. I like the multidirectional tug-of-war feeling I get when playing… decisions about which neighbourhoods to invest effort in are robust and at my game table inspire a lot of table-talk and politicking.

[b]The Walled City: Londonderry & Borderlands[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]The Walled City has been on my radar for a while so I was very excited when I finally got a chance to play and also surprised by how much it diverges from a lot of other area control games that have come after El Grande. 

The two big differences are the map and the citizens you can deploy. The card play is also different, you build walls and roads using cards which also dictate how many and where you can place your citizens. When you begin the game you have a map that has yet to be divided into neighborhoods. There are predefined sections where roads/walls [i]may potentially[/i] be placed, but your actions will determine that. As you subdivide the map into neighborhoods you are creating the areas that will score you points. Once you build a road/wall you then have to decide which citizens you want to place in each neighborhood. There are two types of people you can deploy, peasants and nobles. Nobles outrank peasants and will win ties, but at the end of the game if the are not completely surrounded by walls they will flee which could potentially cause you to lose control of an area. There are also watchtowers which will grant you points based on majorities, but if I have piqued your interest at all please check out a review because there is a lot more going on than I have briefly described here.   

The important question for me was how it compared to El Grande, which may be my favorite game? The best way I can answer that is to say while both are area control games they both give you very different play experiences. El Grande has a simple rule set which allows players to completely focus on the other players at the table; El Grande is all about players interacting with one another and defining how the game will play out. The Walled City also has significant player interaction, but it also adds more rules to the mix. has a lot more rules to digest.  solve. The Walled City adds some more rules to the formula, and while you're still playing the players at the table you also have to play the game [i](if that makes sense)[/i]. 

Even with the added complexity, The Walled City is still an excellent game I hopefully will get the chance to play more of. I really appreciate the new ideas the designers brought to an area control game, it certainly provided a very memorable play experience. I really think folks who enjoy more complex Euros would really enjoy The Walled City since it incorporates mechanisms found in those types of games into an area control game.[/i]

Solid offering and well designed. Interesting take on area control as you a) define the regions during the game and then b) have to reallocate some of your forces for a second set of scoring opportunities while dealing with some of your pieces running away. 

Add hand management and some variety in boards and you have a game with some legs.

Area majority where the players define the areas.  And there are two superimposed area majorities happening, one in the areas, and the other in the factions (which are distributed around the areas in a nonlinear way).  I love it also because there is no repetition.  Every game proceeds from beginning to end with no cycling phases or activities.  First you build the roads, then you build the walls, then you find out who won.  Yet somehow it is all smooth and intuitive.  Endless depth for a game that plays in an hour.

I wanted to enjoy this game more than I did.  It's a fun game, but I'm just not that into area control/influence.  It's not a bad game.  The production value is great - everything is sooo nice.  The turn structure is smooth.  All things considered I think this is a good game - just not quite for me.

I probably would have liked it more had my wife enjoyed it.  The problem for her is that you can [i]really[/i] mess an opponent up by dividing (or changing) a territory they are trying to use for points/influence.

Toward the end of our last game played (this is probably why it was our last game), I noticed my wife going for a particular area that was going to devastate my political grasp.  I made a minor change to the area and destroyed her entire strategy.  It put a very sour taste in her mouth.

I don't like take-that, and I don't make moves that are just to interfere with my opponents.  Other plays of this game haven't haven't had this problem, but the opportunity existing is enough that we haven't played again.  :(

RATING: 4.5
(+) Very elegant rule set, explaining the game takes no effort at all

(+) Short playtime compared to the possibilities the game offers in every move

(+) Colorful and appealing for what is in fact an abstract game

(+) Will play out totally different each time you play

(+) A new twist in area control in which the area's do not have fixed borders. This brings a lot of opportunity into this classic game mechanic. However, this comes at the cost of chaos (see disadvantages)

(+) The fact that the game consists of two big different rounds keeps things interesting. The first half plays differently from the second half. It is also nice that the game comes with 2 different variants and many guild cards.

(+) It is great fun trying to break in into an interesting large area containing multiple faction dice with another area containing lots of your pawns, or trying to shut opponents out.

(+) The games offers plenty opportunity for players to negotiate

(-) Prone to serious analysis paralysis as players only have a very limited amount of actions and each turn there are tons of things to take into account when deciding your move. This might cause downtime, as the board will probably change significantly and you will only be able to start planning your move after the opponent before you has played.

(-) This game is very dynamic, which sure is an advantage, but it comes at the cost of a huge amount of 'chaos' and very little control. This is not a strategic game, but it is a very tactical one.

(-) Most actions on the guild cards make it impossible to effectively plan a strategy as they have the potential to completely change the board set-up. This is a real problem which actually does detract from the fun. The game invites you to think deeply about your moves, but in the end it feels like much of that effort can be wasted due to some chaotic factors.

(-) The tower scoring at the end of the game feels a little light to be the finale of what otherwise is a tense game.

(-) I'm not sure if player order could be a cause for concern. It is clear that being late in turn order is a significant advantage. The game tries to balance this with giving stronger special abilities to players early in player order - we'll have to experiment some more in order to see whether this balances things out or not...

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) The key is trying to control a large area containing multiple dice with a high number of mainly peasants. One way of trying to accomplish this is getting a lot of peasants in a smaller area and breaking a road with a guild card in order to create a bigger area.
(*) Don't focus too much on tower scoring.
(*) When you get the chance to seal an area off by placing a road, it is often interesting to do so: this way you can often ensure having majority in this area.
(*) Being late in turn order is a very significant advantage in my experience

This is a very interesting, very abstracted area control game.  In this game players go through two rounds with 4 phases each.  Most of the phases across both rounds are pretty much the same.  First you align yourself with a guild determining a special power as well as turn order.  Then you build a road (in the first round) or a wall (in the second) dividing the board into neighborhoods.  Then you score based on area control of those neighborhoods.  Finally there is a phase called the defense phase which is just another scoring phase where you place cards with numeric values next to towers containing player pieces.

I like area control but am usually not a fan of overly abstract games and this is very much so in that camp.  However, it is so thinky with a lot of depth and strategy that I couldn't help but like it.  The decision trees are intricate and interesting and there are a lot of ways to play this game that should give you a different experience every time.  Plus the inclusion of special powers from the guilds, even though small (you can only use a power once per round), gives the game even more variation and ways to break the otherwise very rigid structure of the game.

The components are pretty good and this is one of the few games that even though it uses a lot of browns and yellows, the colors are surprisingly rich and doesn't give me that sleepy feeling other games do when they use these muddy colors.  It is also reasonably simple to teach and plays pretty quickly.

A decent worker placement game with some nice twists on walling off areas, etc.

Difficult, clunky rules should not be how an abstract strategy game is typically described.

This is one of my favorite games. I find that each time I play, I get crushed and LOVE to play again.

I think 3 is the sweet spot with this game; with 4 the lack of control is just way too high. My only quibble is that going last in the first epoch seems very very strong, so much so that I'm considering a pregame vp-auction to determine initial turn order. But other than that it's a brilliant, fun game with some good tense decisions. So many clever ideas here come together to form a cohesive, elegant whole. Great little game with a relatively short playing time yet a lot to think about. Loved it.

A decent area majority game.  Plays well, but it doesn't seem to anything particularly novel in this crowded genre.

City builder political sim with heavy area control focused on winning a mayorial election. In the first phase, competing candidates try to shape the election by placing road tiles that demarcate voting neighborhoods in the settlement and by getting a majority of voters in each created neighborhood. Variable strength supporters, and backing settlement member quilds offer special advantages to shift the balance of power and/or change the results at the polls. In the last phase, walls need to be erected and towers controlled to keep the noble and peasant voters from defecting! Simple turn actions but lots to keep track of quickly leads to thinky decisions. I love the use of identical split number decks to assign people to neighborhoods and to value towers that adds another layer in decision making.

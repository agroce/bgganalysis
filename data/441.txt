RATING: 3
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

This really isn't a well-designed game. Sure the idea of the transparent sheets is neat and clever, but its execution is pretty poor. I guess I should cut Richard Garfield some slack, since this is an older game, but this falls for sure in the basket of his bad designs.

Filthy Rich shares the same kind of cheap humor with Munchkin and the same dumb take-that elements, that screw the other players over again and again... dragging the game on and on beyond any reasonable playing time. On top of that the game is HORRIBLY random! There's way too much luck involved in the card drawing and even more in the dice rolling... while there's not a lot of meaningful decisions for the players to make. You can just build a bunch of shops and cross your fingers hoping to receive the favor of the dice.

I have to say that I had fun during my one play of this game, but it wasn't the game's merit... it was the players'! At the same time the game dragged on almost for the entire game night, until we finally let one of the players win and moved on. Therefore I can't really recommend this game to anyone... its ideas might be interesting, but the result is pretty stinky dumb luck-fest.

You have to play it with a variant or two to really make it work (mine are on my two-player list at Luding), but it&#039;s kind of worth it for the novelty of that &quot;binder&quot; system.  Played a lot of this two-player, but that was almost three years ago - it&#039;s been on the shelf since.

RATING: 5
A nearly game for me. There are some clever ideas here and perhaps some of the systems could be ripped off and used in another game - I liked the way the ring binder worked. Of course there is some strategy and plenty of chrome, but ultimaltely this is just a dicefest. If your businesses come up on the dice more than your opponents, you win.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light-hearted dicefest with a novel mechanism (cards in binder pages), but it's very luck-heavy.  The theme is good.  Money is very tight; avoid bankruptcy by playing semi-conservatively (or lose and watch others play).  Aside from luck, timing is important -- especially knowing when to buy luxuries and when to save your cash.  In general, you should prevent one player from grabbing a bunch of cheap luxuries (and winning early), and you should save cash when it looks like someone will go bankrupt (because their luxuries go up for auction)... meanwhile, you need to make sure that you have a sufficient money-making empire to support itself and a luxury or two.  I need to try some of the variants listed in the forum, especially the taxation variant where you pay taxes only once (to avoid the harsh 2x and 3x taxes that cause many of the player eliminations).

Fun game. Taxes came nearly every turn and i got knocked out pretty early but id still like to play some more

RATING: 8
With the rule change to allow selling businesses at any time (even when taxes are rolled on them, or before the start of your turn to buy a luxury) this is a great filler.

A very unique game from Righard Garfield.  The use of a binder to represent competing advertising really makes the game stand out.  This is the preferred end of the night game for our group.

RATING: 5
An interesting premise with some elements of CCGs. Seems to involve waiting for your opponents to bankrupt more than meeting the 'positive' victory condition.

RATING: 3
Nifty but bland. Too much luck for me.

The binder mechanism is what lured me to this game. It's nifty, but it's not implemented in a way that leads to interesting decisions. Feels more like a prop than a tool.

RATING: 3
Overlapping businesses are are unique idea, but the game can bog terribly down due to lots of tax rolls and destructive play. My first game dragged on for nearly two hours.

RATING: 7
This was one of the games that got me into gaming beyond Monopoly, Risk, etc. The binder/pages mechanic is great, and with a few tweaks (see the forums for rules variants that level things out a bit), this one is a great game for non-gamers and geeks alike.

2/5/10 - traded Darjeeling to get this game. Don't take this game too seriously because you could get burned on the dice rolling. The game plays quickly, features potential player elimination and is a very unique concept. Biggest reason why I traded to get this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very unique game element (binder system).  The heavy luck element ruins most games, though.  If you get hits early you get more cash than your opponents and can grab the cheap luxury goods.  If you get screwed early you are basically out of the game because it is very difficult to catch up.  I enjoy the game on occasion, but it is definitely a luck-fest.  If there were a way of balancing things out a little more, and reducing the chilling effect that taxation has, it would be more fun.

A game with a variety of problems; the biggest one is the taxation system, which can drive the game to mind-numbing tedium in no time flat. There are some good ideas, and I think there is a game in here somewhere, but this one is not it.

RATING: 8
I really like this game!  I love the idea of being on a busy city street where signage is everything.  The only thing I don't like is the luxury-buying.  It's too unbalanced in that somebody getting lucky rolls can win too quickly by buying the less expensive luxuries.

Superb 2 or 3 player light and QUICK game, which does need modifications of the rules to play to its best.

RATING: 2
Filthy Rich gets full marks for inventive use of stationary material: a binder with see-through plastic pouches. Unfortunately, the simple economic game of growth is brought to its knees because of total luck of the die which can bestow you with money in no time flat, or run you into bankruptcy faster than a politician can change his opinion. There is no long term challenge to thie game whatsoever: after a while you enter the Zone which ends when the Moon is in conjunction with Venus and Sagit... Oh, sorry, my bad: when someone scores three cards. (But really, nothing would change if you used the Moon instead.) The second glaring mistake which made me decide with a passion never to play this game again is that taxes can grind the game to a halt. They are meant as an equaliser, but if they show up too often, they do nothing but hinder the game. Mr Garfield, if you design something, please make sure that it will simply end out of its own accord, and not due to pure chance.

I'm tempted to award this with a 1 for utter pointlesness&mdash;the winner is the one who was luckiest&mdash;but I'll be gentle and up the rating to a 2 instead for the rather original idea of using such a mundane item.

What a quirky game! I'm very charmed by the graphic design of the binder and the funny business names and slogans. Luck plays a very big factor, in fact it may be one of those games where you're just sort of "along for the ride" in terms of the ups and downs in fortune that you experience (and you can get wiped out by bad luck), but it's a fun ride, and not too long. (I've only played with 3.) Old-school charm.

Innovative (the way it uses UltraPro card sheets to create 4 layers of an alley), colorful with excellent artwork, and a fair amount of strategy thinking about how to cover your opponents signs, etc.  The cards abilities pull a lot from Magic: The Gathering, but what can you expect when the game was designed by Richard Garfield himself.

The mix of luck and strategy is probably 50-50 due to dice rolling & card drawing.  Basically you put your business out and _hope_ someone patronizes your business.  I guess that's just like the real world.

Fun game for 2 or more players, easy to learn, and takes up little shelf space.

Oh, and I only paid $10 for it from some shop that was closing down...

I really enjoyed the unique aspects of this game, and it played VERY well with a non- to new-gamer crowd.  Much to like here, though the taxation was brutal in our first playing.  I expect my rating to rise 1/2 to 1 point after playing with the variants found here on the 'Geek.

UPDATE: Was a bit more fun with the more forgiving "maximum of one taxation per turn" rule.

A fun game. The concept sounds better than the game actually played, but then again, if you are like me, I was expecting big things from that concept. It is luck based, and you can get screwed fairly easily by taxes or bad rolls, but I still find it to be a good time.

RATING: 8
30 minute playtime, humorous. Balancing income and taxes is interesting. The 3-D signs gimmick is actually pretty fun, but the sign-covering fee feels too high to me. The winner is usually the luckiest player. Feels similar enough to Monopoly that you can get non-board gamers to play. We typically remove Tic-Toc's Floating Craps for a more strategically satisfying game.

I admit I haven't given this game much of a fair shot, but I just can't get beyond the cheesy components: Ultra Pro card sleeves and a binder. Garfield was obviously inspired to do this game while flipping through his (complete) Magic:The Gathering collection. I still like the premise, and would consider giving this another look if the components got less of a guerilla game publisher look to them.

Very inventive 3-D mechanism in how signs are placed.  Well worth finding.

On the downside: Game can drag with four players, and two players benefits from house rule found on BGG to remove cheapest luxuries (else game ends much too soon).

Write what you know.  What is the biggest complaint that you have when you are drowning in your own Magic money -- why taxes of course.  There is no way that anyone would have produced this had it not been Richard Garfield's design presenting it to Wizards of the coast.  I'm glad that it happened.  If nothing else this game takes some simple ideas and makes them innovative, but more importantly the simple ideas result in a really fun game (regardless if it came to him while flipping through his binder of magic cards). 

That said, the game has a severe random element to it, and with a string of bad luck you could quickly go from being competative to completely eliminated from play.  That wouldn't be awful if this were a filler, but the game does clock in around about an hour and a half.  Something might need to be done about that. 

As far as games go, though, this one has a great individual feel to it, and is just about perfect for swilling some cold ones.

A unique, interesting game design that unfortunately does not play out too well. Does have plenty of personality, but lasts much too long for a light game and luck plays far too great a role.  I actually enjoy having some luck in a game, but if it&#039;s too dependent on luck, it shouldn&#039;t really last much more than an hour.

A unique and innovative concept (the binder system) powered by a tired, old-school game engine (play a card with lots of text on it and do exactly what it says). A fairly interesting game ended suddenly when one player played a card that knocked the rest of us out immediately. You've got to be kidding me.

I rated this a "6.5" just for Mike. He called it a Monopoly style game, but I don't think that gives it justice. This game has a unique mechanic (the game "board" / pages of card sleeves) that I have never seen before and it made this a pretty interesting game. The basic flaws in the game come out due to the randomness, but its not long enough to make you care.

This is a such a unique game.  Being a Magic the Gathering CCG player in the past, I just love the idea of playing a game in a card folder, with the cards overlaying each other.  Plus the fun of cool graphics and fun business names.  But a bit too dependent on dice rolls, and long term interest is lacking.

Artsy game, the card collection sheet mechanic was probably done the best it could be. I really like the artwork and theme.  Too bad to have to make a game mechanic fit the bits, the game might have been better if it was actually designed first then had components made to fit the rules. I've probably played enough of this already. Got to play again recently and it still has some replay.

The only game I have ever seen where a card binder is used instead of a board. Lots of fun as long as you get a few businesses on the boa...binder. Then you just need a few lucky rolls to rake in the cash needed to purchase the three luxuries it takes to win. *Update* 12/11/08 Lowered rating to 7. If you don't get a good starting hand, if the first few rolls miss your businesses and if you dont get a luxury early it is VERY hard to catch up.

I love the mechanics of this Richard Garfield game.  It is not a perfect design but it is easy to teach and non-gamers seem to pick it up very easily.  My criticism is that the victory condition seems tacked on although I read some variants online that I'd like to try next time it comes out.  This game hits the table a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Playing [i]Filthy Rich[/i] without variants and house rules means you're not playing a fun game.

It also means that Richard Garfield had no idea what he was doing - or possibly that Sir Dick only playtested the game with exceptionally lucky friends who never roll taxation.

Too bad, because there are some cool ideas buried neck-deep in this mess.

The use of the card binder pages is different from any other games. I think you could have a run-away leader problem in some games but in general it is worth checking out. My game did not take long but I can see how this could be a problem.

RATING: 8
Great and amusing bits, interesting game concept: four see-through pages in which you insert opaque cards representing your business's sign; your business can only make money if its sign is visible. Since you flip to different pages somewhat randomly, sometimes your sign may be covered by another. Fun, and can be played in a relaxed friendly manner, or rather cutthroat.

People whine that this game isn&#039;t fair. Life&#039;s not fair, folks. We&#039;ve tried it both ways; tweaking the rules to make this game fair extends the game length horribly. (Sort of like the house rule for &quot;free parking&quot; in Monopoly.) So, suck it up, be cruel, and have fun.

Used to be one of my favorite games, and still like bringing it out from time to time. Love the novel use of card sheets to create a 3D perspective. Luck plays a huge factor in the game, and the entire group can get themselves run into bankruptcy with several poor rolls of the dice early in the game. Still, the novel elements and interesting concepts keep me from disregarding the game completely.

Great concept!  Who knew that a card binder could be used as a game board.  Big props to Richard Garfield for the innovative and outside the box design.  Unfortunately, while dice are an integral part, there is just too much luck involved to make it truly fun to play.  Good enough to bring out once in a while.

2004-04: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] This is a really novel game concept.  Fairly fun, with lots of risk (and luck) considerations.

2011-09-10: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] The above comments are still true; however, I would like to add that the luck is pretty harsh in this game.  It's still a great concept worth revisiting and updating….

A bit underrated and forgotten game, this, a very innovative and smooth thing. You play out shop signs in a plastic sheet holding 3x3 cards, roll dice to see where customers go. Pages flip, your signs are covered by other signs. Use cards to take over your opponent's businesses, and buy luxury stuff. Most luxury wins. Fabulous.

This one is interesting & fun. Normally play with the limited taxation suggested rule.

It feels sort of like Pandemic, only with zombies instead of disease cubes, and every man for himself. Unfortunately, it sort of feels like multiplayer solitaire most of the time, with each person playing their own game of Pandemic. Most of the player interaction comes into play when you lure zombie hoards in your border states into your opponents' territories, and you can nuke your neighbors, but only if you research that tech. We may have missed a rule on this, but it seems like you can't trade resources with other players, which is too bad since that would be a good source of player interaction; it feels like you SHOULD be able to trade resources, since they are gathered and spent like in Settlers of Catan (resources are wood/metal, chemical, fuel, and food).

All that being said, it is still a cool game, and is really impressive for what is basically an independently published game. You get that sinking feeling after the first turn or two that you're really screwed and just have to do the best you can to preserve as many of your people as possible, while desperately using your dwindling resources working your way through the tech tree towards something that will possible prolong the inevitable.

Luck begins with 3 cards drawn and the dice being rolled for infection to start.

Do your best with the meager resourses you have to divert, stop or destroy the zombie infestation.

Multiplayer solitaire game where the interaction goes only so far as the zombies go.

Half way through the game, I did not bothered myself with what the other players are doing, except to see if I could get some cheap bonus from their tech advancement.

The rest of the game is a math calculation on how much people you can save, how many zombies you can kill and where the zombies will go after finish feeding....repeat every turn but with greater caution in an outbreak turn.

Luck on where the infection starts plays a major part on what you can or limited to do. The rest is math.

Exciting for a first game, but doubt I will play much of it.

Rated a 6 (sort of like it), but not because I am at all ambivalent about it.  Some parts of this game were awesome, but some parts were just infuriating.  I think 3 players out of 5 (including me) were ready to punch the designer in the nose if we ever saw him.  Not much reason for us all to be playing at the same time - seems like a better solo game.  Or at least we should have simultaneous turns to reduce downtime.

Review after one play.  A good zombie game, with a fair amount of luck.  It's fun to watch everyone else's civilizations crumble under the oncoming horde.

The dice rolls for technology turned one reviewer off, but I didn't have a problem with it, after all it is a zombie game.

The start of the game is a lot of fun, but the tension seems to drop of midway through the game as your surviving population forms pockets.

We'll see if this bears out with more playing, but me feeling is that the tech tree has some optimal paths to pursue.  Also the game might be a little long for me, but it's hard to say from first play.  First time 5 player, 3 hours.

I'm not much of a zombie person, and I was trying to figure out why.  I think that part of the reason is that I like economic games, and games where you build up.  Zombie games are the opposite, you start with a lot, and it's downhill from there.

This was better than I expected.  Like the tech decisions.  There are chances to screw your neighbors.  Lots of hard decisions on where to put your efforts. The art could be better.  Some of the plastic pieces could use a redesign.  After playing this at BGG Con, 2 of the other players purchased it.

RATING: 5
The game is brutal and not in the awesome way. It simulates the zombie apocalypse scenario quite abstractly (almost in a cube way). In the end, all players learn that they will have to sacrifice multiple regions of their continent in order to be able to survive the game. It is a live and let die kind of a game where everyone is being punished (more or less) evenly and you just try to outlive the other opponents (occasionally dumping zombies in their geographical 'lap' in order to get rid of some zombies coming out for you). It also takes quite a bit longer than what I would be confortable with this kind of game.

I really wanted to like this game, but based on 1 play it was a disappointment.  

The game, like Pandemic, has a great "feel" of hopelessness to it, but unfortunately it seems horribly unbalanced.  Certain techs (such as Quarantine) are way too powerful.  Armies are so expensive (and weak at the beginning) that they are practically useless.  Though the game appears to offer many options, in truth it seems there's really only one way to play.

I'd have to play a couple more times to confirm this, but my first play convinced me not to purchase it right away.  I do think it has some potential if modified slightly, but I"d want to play at least twice more with the original rules before any final decision on that.

Too long and complex on the first play.  The zombies multiply so quickly that you cannot keep them at bay without letting several of the countries in your region fall to the zombies, while creating a small "safe zone" with quarantine (excellent) or razed borders (if you can make enough of them).  The other solid strategy seems to be developing the zombie "cure" as fast as possible since it will allow you to get rid of zombies and rebuild your population simultaneously... in fact, I think the cost of "curing" is too low.  

I really disliked the game immediately after playing it, but after discussing it with my opponents, I feel that it does a good job of capturing the theme and that it would be easier on repeated plays.  However, I was really turned off by the length of the game and the ineffectiveness of several technology developments.

RATING: 6
This is an interesting game - there are parts of it that are clunky, but the theme is expressed very well. Once you know what to pick on the tech tree, you can watch others flail around while you zoom to victory though, my one major gripe.

Great sense of impending doom.  I really like the overall look and feel to the game which reminds me of Romero's Dawn of the Dead crossed with Fortress America crossed with Pandemic (although this is not a co-op).  I'm not a big Pandemic fan, but I think this is a little better, if less elegant and admittedly probably a lot less appealing to most people.  I do think that after a few more plays, a strategy will become a little more apparent.  You probably need to be thinking ahead a few turns to be successful.  I wish there was a little more player interaction too.

El mundo está siendo atacado por una plaga de zombies, que van brotando por todos sitios. Los zombies cuando llegan a una zona comen todo lo que pueden y los que no quedan saciados se desplazan a la zona siguiente. Cada jugador lleva un continente y tiene que hacer uso de sus recursos y puntos de libertad (que son acciones) para desarrollar tecnologías que les permitan atajar esos brotes y mantener un nivel alto de población. La población viene determinada por unos dados de colores que hacen que el juego sea muy llamativo. En este juego no se trata de ver quien va mejor, sino quien es el que menos mal lo lleva, porque todos sufren. Se trata de apagar fuegos por todos los sitios, y tratar de enviar los marrones al vecino. Es muy divertido y las tecnologías a desarrollar permiten multitud de combinaciones para asegurarse la victoria. El juego acaba cuando un contienente desaparece, alguien no recibe un sólo zombie en todo el turno, o se llega al final del track de puntos. Es un juego muy recomendable y se mantiene buen nivel de tensión.

One play. I found the experience futile early on in stopping the zombies as they multiplied rapidly and flowed across other borders. Too many choices amongst the technological "solutions" to the zombie threat, though the 'quarantine' technology seems an obvious choice. Although an effective tool, it severely limits a player's options to do anything else, and results in a virtual standoff.

By BGG rating this one's a 2.  I actively decline playing this game just about every week (one of my regulars really digs it so I get the pleasure of saying 'no' a lot).  I find the game is best described as 'Solitaire with the occasional glance at each other then there's a rule to see who won'.  The game takes forever to play, is untenable with anyone subject to even mild Analysis Paralysis and I spent a good deal of time during the game asking myself 'why haven't I quit yet to do something exciting, like bash my face against a wall or rub my knuckles along a cheese grater' (ok it's not *that* bad, but I was really bored).  

There's a good idea here... but a bad implementation.

RATING: 9
Such a fun game. And it's hard!! There is nothing more discouraging than the first 5 or so turns as you watch your little territories wiped out one by one, with the zombie horde doubling every few minutes. 

What I like most is the multiple routes you can take. I played a game where someone won with military strength alone, while another player used medical and science techs to repopulate his board and get tons of added resources.  There are a lot of ways to win, which says a lot about its replayability.

As for the naysayers who complain about the dice, yes, there are random elements, just as in life. I like this about the game. It makes you stay on your toes and take risks without knowing exactly what's to come. Besides, if you fail a die roll, it's your own fault because you could have boosted your chances by spending some freedom points.

Played a demo game of this at Gencon 2010.  And just loved the theme of the game.  A zombie game where you aren't just trying to kill zombies, but instead trying to manage the outbreaks in your zones, while trying to survive as long as possible.  It was just very refreshing.

Very fun.  Has a learning curve and could use some streamlining, but once you get a feel for what helps, it's a very good time.  Some downtime issues, though, in larger player numbers.  I'm glad to have a zombie game with some real substance and fun.

It's slightly Dungeonquest-y in that it can be a real exercise in pain endurance, but it is possible to make headway.  Interaction is a bit limited.  It's a little like playing Pandemic solitaire and see who does the best, though there are some ways to affect others, especially later in the game with nuclear strike technology.

Rating after only one play. The games is pretty good, but the combat system really did not sit well with any of the players at the table. It seemed pretty lame that in an area where there are your military units the zombies feed and multiply first and THEN you have combat.It just seems counter-intuitive and ass backwards. It also got a bit "gamey" when I was able to use Quarentine to have a huge pile of zombies bounce back and forth between areas each turn like ping pong balls. 

Still the game was great laughs and I love the theme of it. Something on this scale ought to have come out long before now.

Very nice production value for a startup game company's first outing. The board is mounted, the counters are prepunched and not thin pieces of crap, and you get plastic pieces. The cards are a bit thin, but are not bad. At least the edges are rounded and they are actually like playing cards unlike the squared cut cards found in the ATZ boardgame.

I liked this more than the rest of my play group, but not enough to fight for it.  They did not like that you feel like you're getting crushed most of the game and it usually ends in a who loses the least is the winner.  I kind of liked it for this reason.  I mean, what else would you expect from a zombie apocalypse?

Haven't had this for that long, and have only played a few times but its been a really enjoyable couple games.

Looking forward to playing again with the new free expansion "Conflict and Resolution" downloadable here on

I loved World War Z.  Once I found that this was thematically similar to that book, I had to get this game.  From my plays, this game is all about losing slowly.  No one I have played with has come close to exterminating the zombies, and some people are turned off by the overwhelming odds against them.  I do not mind this because I enjoy the zombie apocalypse theme.  If you do not mind battling endless amounts of undead and knowing that you may not succeed, this game is for you.

Some question the power balance and the real lack of choice, but I have not found that to be a problem.  This might be due to my limited number of plays thus far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great theme and mechanics that really fit that theme.  Player interaction is more about getting the zombies to visit your neighbours rather than affecting the other players directly.  

The biggest problem I see in this game is the Technology sheet.  I find that some techs are so much better than the others that most people follow the same path game after game.  Maybe with more plays I can experiment with the other techs but I'd like to see an expansion (or variant) to hopefully rebalance the techs and add other new stuff.

I am so over zombies. 
To be perfectly honest, I really don't want to like this game.  I got my wish.  The way this game is set up, there really isn't a winner - it's more like who loses not quite as bad as anybody else.  That fact alone rather thoroughly drains any semblance of fun out of the experience.  Add in the fact that the combat systems/turn structure/everything else about the game is wonky/less than intuitive, it makes for a disappointing game night.  While I am sure that there are those who love anything related to zombies, I ain't one of them.  If that isn't you either, pass on this one.

While it was better then I assumed it would be before playing it, it still felt fairly tossed together. Visually it was a nightmare and I would easily add 1-2 to my rating if it was far more polished. If the play felt more refined I would probably add another 1 to it's score.

I appreciate the ability to follow different tech paths, but many of them seemed fairly so what against the inevitable doom. ie. Why screw around modifying things when you have little time to use them, rather then just quarantine a few spots and the board and finish with a more reliable score.

This game gets high marks for originality and theme.  I’m a zombie-phile and I appreciated the WWZ take on the theme as well as the way zombies eat and multiply such that the danger keeps getting worse and worse each turn, (here it comes) but I came away from the game feeling like it was underdeveloped and in need of some house rules to fix things. 

The overall idea of the game of rapidly multiplying zombies and tech trees one can pursue to mitigate the problems is a very interesting one, but three primary flaws ruin it for me: 1) the techs are imbalanced and not synergistic enough, 2) failing tech rolls isn’t merely a set-back but absolute devastation, and 3) the downtime in this game is painful.  I failed tech rolls of 2+ (twice!) and 4+ on a D12, and instead of losing an action and getting to try again, I had to pay all my resources and then wait to try again. As turns take long in this game, that means 10-15 minutes of waiting before it’s your turn again and then – oops! – you lost another turn so wait another 10-15 minutes and oh by the way you’re so out of the game now you may as well withdraw. I mean, why even have tech rolls? Just make them costs that you can choose to pay for.

There is definitely a lot going on in this game, there are so many tech trees to try and it gets very tense watching the zombies eating your population and causing you to have fewer freedom points, not a good thing because you want to be able to do as many things as you can on your turn.  Not every one will like this type of game but I find it is a good game to bring out once in a while.

After 90% of one play,this game disappointed. I was very worried from the instructions that this would be 5 player solitaire, and I suppose it kind of was, but what kept it exciting was the chaos and intensity of trying your best to keep from drowning in dead. This is by a "realistic" feel of a zombie outbreak. This game isn't about curing the plague; it's about keeping some small piece of humanity alive while facing the apocolypse. Downtime ws largely mitigated by concurrent play. It ends up being more simulation than game as there is only so much you can do to overcome researching technologies. I think the game could have turned out better had they chucked the die roll and made the technology track based more on thoughtful acquisition.

Very fun game. But there is so much overwhelming text on the player boards that it is easy to get lost. Then there is a key rule (that zombies multiply when they eat) which is not in the summary section of the player board. So if you are playing for the first time and using the player board instead of the rule book to dictate what phase of the game you are in, you can easily forget this rule and play it wrong. However, after multiple play through this no longer is an issue.

I am always a sucker for a good zombie film and games utilziing a zombie theme.  Unfortunately, there are precious few "good" zombie films -- and even fewer good zombie games.  Sadly, Zombie State falls on the "not good" side of the equation.

I really like the theme -- sort of a "28 Days Later" concept.  However, the game has numerous flaws and WAY overstays its welcome.  There are some neat ideas here, but it sorely needs more and better development.

There are some things I really like about this game (tech tree, action point system, theme) and some that I don't (difficulty, bookkeeping, strange player interactions). I really felt after one play that it might just not be the game for me. However, upon reading the FAQ on the website and seeing comments from other people, it seems that's a common experience. It might take a few plays to not seem like a game of "winning by losing the best." Have to play again to get a better handle on how I feel about it.

The first time I played this we got some rules wrong and this very punishing game was even more so. Even after discovering the mistakes we made, I can't see wanting to play this again.  The artwork is bad, there's tons of down time, early bad rolls can ruin your entire game, it lasts too long, it's super fiddly (managing the zombie tokens is a pain in the ass), it seems very poorly play tested and balanced.  Despite that, I won't rule out trying it once more under the right conditions and with the correct rules.

Yeah, not sure. Seems more like 'logic puzzle of the dead' to me.

There are some really good ideas here (the tech tree, the population counters, etc.), but the game is too long for the little player interaction that exists. 

The multiple victory/loss conditions are actually a weakness in this game, sometimes punishing good gameplay.

Ironically, this one will probably appeal more to those who like drier, more analytical games rather than highly thematic games, since the "zombies" work well as a mechanic but don't really create the expected atmosphere.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2011)

I´m a huge fan of the Zombie genera, and when I played this game I was still in my beginnings as a boardgamer, still I didn’t like it very much (I liked most games I tried on 2011), so it goes (almost) without saying that this game isn’t very good. It is a shame as the game has lot of potential and good ideas (worldwide zombie invasion).

Love the theme, like game components and art, and the zombie movement is neat, everything else is a negative. The technology tree is very unbalanced IMO, and it is obvious which technologies you need to pursue. Very long playtime for what the game offers, high downtime (the worst) and lots of uncontrollable luck with events and dice rolls (the tech tree benefits don’t compensate enough for this).

Will give it another chance with fast players, but my desire to play this is very low.

Current Rating: 4.5

Zombie games usually don't do it for me. I can't emerge in the (nonsensical/stupid) story while gameplay in most/all cases is neglectable. Nonetheless, I had hope for this one as a zombie game on a strategic level with a tech tree and elements of Pandemic sounded promising. What a disappointment! It is as random as zombie games can expected to be while at the same time adding complexity and especially length. AP sets in when people ponder about advancing on the tech tree but it's just not worth the effort. The advantages gainable by better managing the tech tree are not large enough to compensate the luck factor of failed test rolls and random outbreaks destroying the best laid plans while sparing your neighbour. Pretentious! Add to this the lack of game development with unbalanced starting positions, rules ambiguities and clunky design decisions and I pass on this in future.

RATING: 5
This isn't a bad game, it just isn't in my sweet spot.  A lot of time is spent desperately holding on to territory and trying to force zombies to other countries, and hoping you don't get screwed by bad research die rolls.  For the enjoyment I get out of it, the game is about an hour too long.

I won it in the Free Zombie State board game drawing!  OMG!

Game gives me that "drowning" feeling I get from games like Ghost Stories and Year of the Dragon.  You have to do your best with what you've got left, and what you've got left deteriorates with time.  It certainly felt like World War Z.

I think it might need more random events, given my first blush with the game.

The randomness of research rolls is pretty hefty with an almost all-or-nothing consequence, even though it's crucial to the game. I personally need to tweak things to feel comfortable with the randomness involved in such a long game.

Practically speaking, this game will only come out when zombie fans are around. The high-level, global abstraction is an interesting take on the zombie apocalypse theme, and the growing zombie hordes will probably keep zombie-lovers satisfied.

Sub par resource management game.  There is a an elaborate tech tree but I found myself with very little opportunity to explore the tech options because I was constantly putting out fires on my borders.

My highest praise for this game is in how they have made a fairly complex system completely straight-forward and intuitive.  Just about everthing about the game is totally obvious from the pieces, tables and cards.  When you read how things are done, you often say "oh, duh, course.." 

I played with non-board-gamers and they quickly understood and got very into it.  Kudos for that.  In other words, I would say this is a game accessible even to a non-gaming crowd.

My complaint about the game is the lack of any sort of cooperation between the players, as in Pandemic.  I don't know why, I guess because we aren't actively fighting each other I assumed it would be more cooperative (it is a mildly competetive game.)

Yay another zombie game! There is no genre so played out as the Zombie Apocalypse. This one features a set of tech trees of which some have virtually no use and some that are too good to ignore so you pretty much just end up doing the same thing everytime. The subtle nudging of zombies into your opponents territories is a bright spot in this game but otherwise you just survive the onslaught as long as you can and tech up as much as possible.

Played this at Origins 2013 with Eric and a couple.  It was VERY daunting, depressing at times even.  This game POUNDS you in the first few rounds, barely giving you any hope at all of surviving.

And that's great.

As long as the players can stick with it (and, frankly, it's also better if it's not EVERYONE's first time with it, having to learn through the directions together like we did), it starts to show it's magic.  The game IS unforgiving, Outbreaks WILL happen EXACTLY where you don't want them to...and that random d12 roll will sometimes be your best friend and sometimes...not.

But I didn't mind the random rolls, because honestly where outbreaks will happen should never be expected, and you SHOULD be nervously waiting, palms sweaty, waiting to see if your will fortified island you created is going to have a outbreak right in the center.

But then, there's also ways to prevent all of that, if you plan accordingly with your limited resources.  One of the other players did mention, however, that there would seem one could come up with the perfect tactic, and just have a specific build order and autowin as long as they adjusted for what government they were, or what events or outbreaks happened.  But I think that's something that would take a while to develop, and even then wouldn't be guaranteed, so it still seems this game would be quite a lot of fun for a while.

Well, I wouldn't necessarily use the word "fun"....stressful, sweat-inducing good time, though.

Traded PA:RiR and $30 for this in 2013 BGF .

Intense game. Right off the bat you feel an almost desperate and insurmountable force against you, you gradually bunker in and if you react and strategize correctly, you'll purge yourself of the zombies. 
The game is pretty much multi-payer solitaire for first timers, then it turns into a cooperative game, then it turns into a distrustful cooperative game that is a good showcase of the dark side of competition even in the face of a universal threat.

Attempted to pre-order 28 JAN 2010 and failed.  E-mail sent to the company about this.  Successful pre-order made 28 JAN 2010.  Notified 26 APR 2010 that it has been shipped.

Played wrong in the first 3 games - at least it was a 5 person game.  We forgot to add a zombie every time a zombie ate.  We also did not distinguish between offense and defense for the military.  We did not restrict use of the technologies to the Action phase unless stated otherwise. MUST PLAY AGAIN!!!

After quite a few plays, it just didn't click.  No one in the group is interested, including me.  The rules do not make it easy to handle the oddball events and they have a huge impact on the game.

Played this game twice now. My overall conclusion is that for what it is, it's too long.  The number of various random elements make it too chaotic for 90 minutes+.  If you blow a roll for one of the technologies it could be devastating if the other random factors have also turned against you. This is not game where you can do anything to get out of the hole-it's a self fueling cycle of punishment for rolling that 1 (where you needed a two or higher on a 12 sided dice). Themewise it's certainly 10/10, but do you want to be a pawn of the game system for 2 hours.  Even if you win, it lacks satisfaction, as you just didn't get boned as much as others by the system.  If you like games where you sink or swim based more on your gameplay, then this game lacks depth-it's more snakes and ladders than chess.  It would be a better card game with a 30-60 minute play time.

The art in this is just really unfortunate. Tom Vassal has it that the tech tree is pretty seriously out of balance and I agree, but the designer's made some efforts to correct that by putting out some free expansion material that's helpful and entertaining. The scope of the game, though, is just wonderful, and I enjoy it.

This game as no player interaction! AND it would have been so easy to add it. In Zombie State, players gather resources cards with which they spend to buy technologies/special powers. Why don't let players trade resources?

I lied -- there is some interesting player interaction. Zombies move towards regions with the largest (human) population, so players can manipulate the populations of their regions in order for zombies to move towards their opponents. However, this doesn't happen that often since there aren't many adjacent regions in which opposing players own. It would have been so much more interesting if there were more varied opportunities to manipulate the movements of the zombies to the detriment of your opponents.

In your typical Ameritrash/Euro with lots of special powers, there is typically some lame, tacked on mechanic that enables players to hinder how other opponents acquire these special powers. For example, Puerto Rico enables players to decide when special powers/building are purchased, and puts a limit of how many of these buildings may be purchased. In Zombie State, none of this exists. Players can play simultaneously during the phase in which players purchase technologies.

The theme is the only saving grace in this one.

I enjoy this game.  The zombie terror starts off looking more like an inconvenience than anything else, and then snowballs until you're totally swamped.  Trying to decide which tactics to use to stem the flow is interesting, though the random outbreaks can rain on your parade in a overly harsh way at times.

There is a huge amount of satisfaction to be gained, however, in reaching the point where you have regained some control of the situation, and can even think about not just surviving, but turning the tide in your favour.  It's rare to be that successful though.

This is not co-op, and there's minimal interaction with other players (though using different techs to manipulate the zombies into migrating to other player's countries can be fun), but this is like a version of [i]Pandemic[/i] that I will actually want to play.

RATING: 5
It's about as much fun as you can expect a game that's 70 per cent luck to be. First couple turns are quite fun, as the hordes spread and you try to come up with a strategy to defeat them. But by turn 3 the issue is close to being decided, you just have to play a lot more to reach the resolution. And it will come down largely to chance in the end - where the random outbreaks happen, whether you fail or succeed on random research attempts, and the very powerful (good or bad) random event cards.

Our first game was a little rough.  Though the game seems pretty simple, it was hard to explain zombie movement and we got confused by the defense/offense combat so took us a couple turns to iron everything out.  It's a really cool design but is super fiddly so can take awhile to play.  You really need multiple plays before you get the tech tree down.  Recommended if you like empire building & detailed tech tree games.  But not for casual players.

After only 1 play here is how I rate it:
Components = 10 the pieces are excellent
Theme = 9 does a good job conveying the theme through out the game
Replayability = 7 not sure when the game will feel "the same as before" but it has limited variability, tech sheets, event cards and that's about it.
Fun Factor = 8 I thought the game was fun, just after I finished playing my first thought was "I'd play this again, but this time I'd..."  A good sign.
Rules = 9 very easy to follow and laid out well.
43 points out of 50 possible OR a B.

Edit 6/20/10: after 2 more plays not much change has changed from my initial review.  However, I would now edit the "replayability" score since it does seem to be limited in scope to just what's available on the tech sheets.  That being said I might lower the score from 7 to 6.

1 play, 4er, 4 hours.

A fun, relatively simple (except for the first play -- a lot of techs to figure out!) game that plays pretty well to the zombie theme. But it is way too long -- if play time were cut in half, I'd probably bump my rating up to a 7! But it's probably great for the "Ameritrash" players.

The good:
- once you're familiar with the game, mechanics are pretty straightforward
- nicely matches the theme: you start with a few zombies, but are very quickly overrun; you end up creating fortified centers (where you protect the important people!) surrounded by wastelands; zombies move as you'd expect, towards where the people/food are located; great fun when you manage to direct the zombies into other players' territories!
- lots of techs to try out, with a pretty cool (and simple) development mechanism where it becomes easier to discover a tech after others have already found it

The bad:
- the game is way too long. Our 4 hours was atypical -- we had some exceptionally slow play -- but even the box says 2-3 hours! 60-90 minutes would be just right for this!
- all those techs! So many that it'll be tough to figure out what you want to do on the first turn
- Quarantine seems overpowered relative to its cost
- the board is very busy!
- failing a tech roll seems a bit too costly? But maybe not, since you can always spend AP improving the odds significantly
- what "diplomacy"? Or maybe they really do mean diplomacy "of the dead" ... i.e., braaaaaaiiiiiinnns!

--- Summary ---
Each player controls one region of the world, divided into 12 territories. 6 territories produce 1 (of 4) resources, and all start with a population of 1-6 (use a d6 to indicate current pop). The board is seeded with zombies by having 2 "Outbreaks": start players roll a d12 -- all players hit by the Outbreak use the number rolled and place a zombie in that territory of their region, but only if there is a population die there (if not, roll again; you're safe after 3 rolls fail to generate a legal zombie placement).

Each round, first collect resources: 1 card for each of your production centers that still have a population die. Players start the game with 6 action ("freedom") points each turn; the number decreases as you lose population dice -- use plastic pawns to indicate these on your player board. Then draw 3 random event cards (not on turn 1); these are a mix of good and bad things; as the game progresses, more and more Outbreak cards (triggering an Outbreak when they come up).

Next, all zombies that can feed (i.e., are in a territory with a population die with pips) do so: each feeding zombie reduces the pip count by one (if down to 0, remove die from board) and creates a new zombie; both of these become inactive (flip token). All remaining zombies then move (and flip to inactive). From any region, 3 go to the most populous neighbor, then 2 to the next-highest die, then 1 to the rest in descending population order cycling until all zombies have left the now-empty region. Finally, zombie combat occurs: tanks eliminate zombies in a simple 1-for-1 (modified by tech that can increase tank strength).

Next, in turn order, players use all their action ("freedom") points. AP, often with some combination of resource cards (RC), can be used to build military units (tanks), reinforce units (barricade), move/attack units, attempt to develop tech, use already-discovered tech, or draw more resource cards. The techs come in 3 types (military, medical, physics) each in 3 tiers -- must have 3 Tier 1s before going to Tier 2, and 2 Tier 2s before going to Tier 3. These provide a wide variety of new abilities.

End the round with cleanup: reset all zombie tokens to active, advance players along the Mutation Track (game/event timer) -- outbreaks happen as you move along; you move along faster as you get into higher tech levels. Rotate Start Player and go again! 

The game ends either after someone reaches the end of the Mutation track, one player has lost all pop -- in either case, player with most surviving pop wins -- or if any player has 1+ Tier 3 tech AND manages to keep all their territories _completely_ free of zombies for an entire round -- that player wins!

This isn’t a domination game even though the board looks like A&A or Risk.  It is (and should be) about survival.  You win if you survive longer then your opponents.  The game is constantly adding new zombies through outbreaks or when zombies feed, they generate more zombies.  This creates a nearly unstoppable hoard which eats population centers in giant swathes across the globe.  An interesting tech tree provides interesting decisions and you have to struggle with trying for technology for  the 'future' or try to save some souls here and now.  This game is definitely not for everyone, but if you think you will like it, you probably will.

Juegazo donde te comes las uñas todo el tiempo. ¡Malditos zombies! ¡Parecen conejos! Una lucha desesperada, para terminar acorralado en un rincón luchando a brazo partido con los escazos recursos que te quedan. Gestión, dados y zombies: una mezcla explosiva.

Wow. Settle in for this tough slog. Very thematic in that you feel like the zombie hordes will over-run you. Because they will. Very challenging. Will require you "re-think" gaming before going in because often you're playing to "lose the best," rather than win. This is not for everyone!

RATING: 4.5
Seems undertested. Game takes way too long for what it is, and is a bit fiddly. The Mutant track should be mutated into something simpler. The Quarantine technology seems over powered and some others underpowered. House rules might make it enjoyable.

If it had a slightly higher production value, and I could figure out the 'perfect' starting conditions for a challenging, but not impossible, game, this would have a perfect 10.  It is just as good gamewise as LNoE.

I'm mixed on this one.  The zombie eating and movement rules are awesome,  I really like how that works.  I also love the population dice. Even the tech tree is kind of cool, although I'm positive that Quarantine is overpowered.

The biggest flaw is downtime of which there is a lot.  You will likely sit there for 10 minutes doing nothing which is a bit lame.  Also, the fact that failing a tech check costs you all the cards is brutal.  Fail 2 and you're likely done for.

The game is so long for what it is but I like it.  I wish it was about 90 minutes maximum and then it would likely be perfect.

This is what "themed games" are all about. A nice, clean engine with a couple rules thrown in, all with the goal of convincing you you're a continent overrun with zombies.

I love the Zombie rules: they behave exactly as one would expect. Move towards people, eat people. The fact that you can "direct" them with some cynical population moves makes it all the more fun.

It has more than its share of luck - if you happen to get a Zombie outbreak in the wrong place at the wrong time... well... that's life in a zombie outbreak.

Second play where they bitched and moaned through the whole game and then at the end said 'I'd play that again'

A great idea for a game that's let down by a few poor design choices.

1) The poor get poorer.  If a bad swing of luck puts you in the hole early, you're just going to fall down further and further.  The odds of a dramatic comeback are close to nil.  Losing geographic ground also costs you in terms of resource accumulation and number of actions.  I think a simple fix would be getting rid of the dice role to determine success or failure for technology advances.  The game's hard enough without wasting an entire turn's worth of actions and resources on a failed attempt to become slightly more powerful.

2) Prone to analysis paralysis.  Lots of number crunching, here.  The game drags for too long as players weigh their options.  And, since it's basically multi-player solitaire, that can be a lot of downtime in between turns.

3) Why competitive?  It doesn't make thematic sense, and there's very little opportunity to screw over other players anyways. I'd like it better if reworked into a co-op.

I'll gladly give the game another go; I think the theme is novel and that some of my identified problems could just be lack of strategic understanding on my part.  But I was definitely left wanting more, or at least something different, after my first play.

Area control.  Since the combat is against a pre-programmed force, I'm a little bit more tolerant of the militarization aspect. Not that it's going to make me choose to play this if there are other options.

The world is too late. The virus known as MV1 has gone global. You, the leader of your people, have moved quickly to consolidate your local governments in hopes that you are not too late to carve some chance of hope out of what appears to be none. Rushing to develop effective technologies and retrain your military against this new threat proves difficult but is your only chance at salvation. Resources will prove important and become continually scarce as MV1 continues to sweep through your territory. Do you have what it takes to keep your people alive? Or, better yet, can you eliminate the threat of the walking dead from your territory completely? Many technologies lay at your disposal if you test them successfully, but the true strength of these technologies lie in the versatile combinations that you choose to use. Will you rely on military strength, physics and science, or research medicine to find a cure? Perhaps your survival lies in utilizing combinations of these technologies. Either way your fallen countrymen have only one form of diplomacy and that is that they are at peace only when they are feeding. Feeding on you and your people and spreading the deadly MV1 viral infection. Welcome to The Zombie State: Diplomacy of the Dead.
Game Play:
You are the world leader of a group of nations. Each turn zombies feed and randomly spread throughout your territory, quickly reducing your population and increasing the number of zombies. At the beginning of the game you have no technologies or military that are effective against the viral threat on a worldwide scale. Each turn you must maximize the use of resources to draft and use military, test technologies, and then strategically use these successfully tested technologies. As the game progresses, outbreaks and the spread of zombies makes the game more difficult through a loss of population, resources, and freedom to act. However, if you have been an effective leader you will have developed effective technologies that you may use to try and eliminate the threat from your territory completely. Otherwise leaders will find the game ends with the total conversion of their population into the walking dead.

Basically Pandemic, but not cooperative, and way more depressing. Every time I've played I was amazed how badly I lost, but then again there's quite a lot to keep in mind in terms of all the techs to try. I feel like once I get better at it, I'll enjoy it more, since I won't get so despondent!

The novel World War Z in a boardgame. Multiple paths to victory, sacrificing your population for the greater good, watching your neighbors become zombie food, this is a great game. Highly recommended.

Originally rated a 8 - and will likely go lower - long and fiddly - suspect it will be hard to get to the table given other choices.

Still waiting for a good strategic Zombie game.

Good, fun mix of Risk and Pandemic. Becomes somewhat multi-player solitaire as regions are separated by abandoned wastelands, but by then you are busy trying to solve the puzzle of surviving and getting rid of those pesky zombies, so not a big problem.

Zombie State has a great concept. Players take on the role of world leaders that are trying to maneuver their countries through a World War Z styled zombie apocalypse. The game is mostly driven by passive aggressive decision making, with each leader trying to protect his borders while gently nudging the zombies into neighboring countries. It all plays out fairly intuitively and it is quite a bit of fun to watch an opponent's stronghold get gutted in a matter of minutes. Especially when it's the territory that you strategically abandoned that is responsible for funneling the horde of zombies their way!

There are only two things that stop me from playing this more often. First off, activating the zombies is incredibly tedious. It's not so bad the first half or so of the game, but by the time the world starts getting overrun, flipping all those tokens just flat out sucks. Admittedly, I can't think of a better way to do it, but that doesn't make it any less irritating. Second, the map board has the worst color palette I have ever seen. The colors are all nauseatingly bright and they all clash with each other. It's really awful to look at. I guess that's what gives it the indie cred, but I think I'd play it a whole lot more if it was a little more inviting to look at.

I guess I'll start with what I didn't like. My biggest issue is rolling for techs; missing a roll is WAY too big, especially early game when you're losing close to your whole hand either way. In general, I think the number of rolls is small enough that the randomness of them has too large an impact on the game state. I know that there are ways to mitigate all of these, but there aren't really any good options. I also think the event cards and said rolling make it difficult to form long-term strategies, and for a game of this length, that's an issue. Having said all of that, there are a lot of meaningful decisions here (even if the game state can quickly nullify what otherwise seemed like a great idea), and I like that it has a similar feel to Pandemic (in my opinion) without having the alpha dog problem. In general, I'd still rather play 2 or 3 games of Pandemic in the same length of time, though.

Initial rating.  Will probably go up.  It's like Pandemic with zombies and everyone's out for themselves.  Most zombie games are tactical.  It's nice to see the theme applied at the strategic level.  Overall, a great surprise from an Indy.  Time to come up with a 6-player variant where the 6th player controls the zombies somehow.

Not the Zombie game you are looking for.  

There are some ideas here that might be grounds for an interesting game, but the game needs a lot more development.

Some things overpowered (quarantine), some things underpowered (military), some things stupid (rolling for technology).

As is, it is a game that you can't wait to finish, put back into the box, and put on your "for trade" list.

Zombies spawn across the globe then start converting your population into zombies. It is impossible to kill them off so you are riding out the storm as best you can. There is a tech tree for defensive/offensive powers that you can develop but it is a challenge. Players need to play quickly and do much of the turn simultaneous.

RATING: 6
there is quite a bit to like here, from the rampaging zombies, to the interesting development of technologies to fight them.  there are strategies to lead zombies out of your states, or trap them between vacated states.  but something also seems off about the game -- maybe it's a little too gleeful at producing more zombies.  it didn't go over well, and seemed too difficult for our group.

Unbalanced, multi-player Solitaire. Give me PANDEMIC any day of the week.

In places the artwork is average, and the production values are pretty low, lacking polish and refinement.

Not so keen on the flavor text being lifted from a mis-mash of zombie films which, lets face it, 95% of them are shyte...

The playtime is also far too long for my liking. Most games will stretch to the 3-4 hour mark.

Awesome game!  Everytime I play this game, I like it even more.  It's a nailbiter, and the goal is to loose least fastest.  There are a bunch of ways to reach that goal.

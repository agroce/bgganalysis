A gem among pocket size games, and is a wonderful worker placement game. Each player has 13 worker/marker which is not only ships, goods, buildings and also VP and money markers. In my first game, the lead runner had to gave up 3 points to retrieve the last worker and used it to score the last 5 points!
The entire game comprised of only 13x4 worker cubes plus 23 cards (12 locations, 2x4 player boards and 3 technology cards), but the decisions and interactions are unlimited.

1st play: A good lunchtime game of exploration, trading and building. There is an interesting flexibility to the usage of cubes, and a small built-in catch-up mechanism. Plays fairly fast, and feels a bit like 8 minute Empires, but explore & trade instead of area control.

2nd play: We sat down to play this and then realized it only plays 3-4. For a filler style game, 2p is a must. Requiring 3 takes it down a notch.

Lets take a moment to marvel at the ingenuity of Hisashi Hiyashi in creating a game of reasonable substance out of 24 cards plus thirteen cubes per player.  Indeed, Sail to India makes a virtue of its limitations by having that small supply of cubes represent everything that moves and a few things that don't.  There are deliciously angsty moments when you realise that the ship cube you had plans for needs to go and be a vp or money marker.

Beyond that, Sail to India reveals its limitations.  Strategic options boil down to chasing discovery points, selling goods or building churches. Pick one and focus on it exclusively.  Wasting time to mess with another player's strategy is probably a recipe for defeat.   

The AEG edition is a handsome little package.

Feels restrictive. I can't score points until I get a cube to score them? I can't get money until I get a cube to track it? Not a fan.

Το Sail to India έρχεται σε ένα μικρό κουτάκι τράπουλας και έχει μέσα 24 κάρτες και λίγα κυβάκια. Περιμένεις λοιπόν να παίξεις κάτι σε χαλαρό φιλέρακι και αντ’αυτού καταλήγεις σε ένα light eurogame με τα όλα του. Φτιάχνεις καράβια, εξερευνείς προς την Ινδία σαν επίδοξος Vasco da Gama, κάνεις εμπόριο προϊόντων, διαλέγεις τεχνολογίες και φυσικά χτίζεις κάστρα και καθεδρικούς. Άλλωστε Euro χωρίς καθεδρικούς δεν γίνεται.

Μαζεύεις VP με διάφορους τρόπους (όχι μόνο με ναούς), ενώ ενδιαφέρον είναι πως οι παίκτες διαλέγουν το πότε θα λήξουν το παιχνίδι. Τρέχουμε προς την Ινδία ή καθόμαστε να φτιάξουμε engine?? Υπάρχουν αρκετές επιλογές για τους παίκτες ενώ βασικό ρόλο παίζει και το τι τεχνολογίες θα διαλέξεις καθώς είναι όλες μοναδικές. Όποιος πρόλαβε τον Κύριο είδε.

Λιτά components, εύκολοι κανόνες, διάρκεια παιχνιδιού γύρω στα 45 λεπτά με 3 άτομα. Έξυπνη η γενικότερη χρησιμοποίηση των κύβων. Το παιχνίδι είναι μια ωδή στο micromanagement. Δεν ξέρω πως τα πάει από replayability όμως.

Αξιόλογο light eurogame. Του βάζω λίγο παραπάνω για να επιβραβεύσω την προσπάθεια του σχεδιαστή (Ιάπωνας προφανώς) να φτιάξει κάτι ουσιαστικό με τόσα λίγα components. To minimalistic design στα καλύτερά του.

A decent design with some euro gaming bang for the buck in a small package, but thematically, I am a bit tired of shipping goods for victory points, and planning for tiny incremental VP bonuses.  The return to home base (virtually every other turn) mechanic is not a mechanic I enjoy playing with at all (see Albion for example), though yes, it does make thematic sense.

Traded. Though I liked the game quite a bit, it didn't hit the table as often.

Rare game where I fell in love with its mechanics more than actual game itself. Due to the original form of the game when first published, the game itself invented a very smart way to consolidate all the status controlled by the cube and nothing else.

Because of that, the game can be a bit fiddly especially after some time off so it's hard to come back even if you wanted. One of the game that I had with 4 player dragged quite a bit and I'm not too sure if that was due to AP player or game is prone to drag.

RATING: 7.6
It's basically a Euro that fits in your pocket, but I really love the set up, it's fairly intuitive although most of the gameplay involves shuffling your cubes around to either gather or return resources to the home city (Lisboa), 'discover' new coastal towns or use markers to buy technology, increase ship speeds, etc. Pretty sweet considering how compact it is.

first play impressions:

there are a lot of clever ideas.  Each player has a limited supply of generic cubes that (in carcassonne style) can turn into a myriad of useful objects or people.  They can be ships, bankers, or merchants depending upon where you place them on the cards.

The limited supply plus large number of options would seem to create some interesting opportunity cost choices, but in the first play there didn't seem to be much tension at all.

The steps required to generate income came off as tedious and I never felt that taking one action meant I was missing out on something else good that I might have done instead.

I need to play it again tho to see if anything more interesting is there.  For now it just seems like a lot of stuff to do with not much actual game underneath it all.

Tiniest full-blown eurogame I've seen. The size of the box is deceptive, because this is not a filler game at all. The "cubes as everything" concept is genius; you might not even be able to score points if you've used all your cubes elsewhere. One downside is that the "straight-up rush to India" strategy is extremely potent and can end the game really fast if no other player also threatens it on the first turn. Otherwise, very impressive for its size.

A '6' with room to grow. The unique economy (the same pieces are interchangeably used as markers and workers) is hard to wrap one's brain around. I won, but I'm not sure what I did better than the other players.

First play: Simple yet beautifully balanced filler that fills a nice 30 minute gap at the end of the evening. The multi-function of the cubes is subtle and economic with components. The need to allocate your cubes to allow scoring and the storing of gold is a touch of genius. Small enough for the back pocket, just a gem on every count.

RATING: 5
Reminds me a bit of Meuterer as I think there is a decent amount of game here with a small set of cards and pawns.  Players have 12 pawns, 2 start as ships, 3 as scientists, and 1 as a money marker.  You will also need 1 as a VP marker.  The thing is, each time you go over $5 or 5VP, you need to use another marker.  However, you also use markers to build buildings, as ships to sail, and as goods markers.  I suspect this tension will be nice.  The game itself is relatively simple.  With ships in Lisbon, you can sail to other ctiies (cards) based on ship technology and if the goods/buildings on the cards haven't been claimed (markers on them), you can claim them and use them to make money and VPs.  I think this will be a nice game to own and I'm hoping I can score a copy.

This might be my favorite game currently! I haven't played it enough to really dig into every angle of it yet, but each time I've played, I've been able to try a new strategy and at least be semi-successful with it. 

I like that there's not just one route to victory, and if you find your original strategy getting blocked by another player, you can potentially change things up and keep pushing forward! I'm also a huge fan of the cube management system that they've devised. It works really well to have a simple cube represent so many different parts of the game! 

I'm glad that it was picked up for US distribution. I can definitely see myself buying this one for friends back in the States in the future! So much game is contained in the little box! I only wish there were cubes and cards that allowed for a 5th or even 6th player to join. But other than that little complaint it's just a fantastic game to me! I can't wait to play it again very soon! I'd also be very curious to find out if there are any expansions planned for the future...

While I know that the term "broken" has to be used carefully, this game does seem to pretty much fit that.   The optimal method in a 3 player game at least is as third player to increment sailing speed then just rush down through the cards and end the game as quickly as possible.   It's theoretically possible to beat it, but that assumes little to no competition -- something that just doesn't practically exist with 3+ players.   Failed design.

This is a neat minimalist game - very much what we except from Japanese games at this point: simple, quirky, pretty analytical, sort of a "concept game". Almost a throwback to the old microgames: a simple idea fairly well-executed in a small package, but pretty disposable and without much of any replay value. Although I enjoyed Sail to India, I can't help feeling that at $20 list it's overpriced. I would have felt better if I had paid $9.99 for a blister-pack game or something. It requires a very specific group of players with a very specific set of tastes for this to want to come off the shelf very often.

For me, Sail to India is a good example of a game that works just fine mechanically, but lacks anything that actually makes it fun.

There are definitely different paths to victory and important choices to make in the game.  With the special abilities, you can pick a strategy and run with it, and it appears that different strategies can work.

Despite that, I just didn't think the game was fun, which is the most important thing.  There's just nothing here to throw a twist into the game to keep you engaged.

I don't really care how big the package is. I do care that the rules of the game are too complex with too many exceptions for a filler.

The multi-purpose cubes are interesting, but the rest of the gameplay felt kind of straightforward to me. Meh

Actions and options on your turn seem very limited.  Turn order is also very important in this game.  In my one play, the person before me was able to block me the whole game preventing me from acquiring any money in the early game.  Not fun.

This is really smooth - an economic trading/exploration game distilled down to its barest elements. (I can't think of a shorter/simpler game that actually has something that could be called a tech tree. OK, "tree" is an exaggeration, but still.)

I particularly like the way cubes for your VP and money track come out of your supply of bought cubes - and on the flip side, the way your money cube can become a spare ship if you spend yourself out. An interesting representation of going all-in on a business venture. 

There seem to be multiple interesting strategies and fairly strong player interaction (of the blocking/"I got here first" variety, but that's very significant here). So long as one or two dominant strategies don't emerge this is a really great quick game.

This is a very preliminary rating of Sail to India after just one play with three players. While I admire the very clever resource management aspect that is introduced with the multipurpose cubes, the rest of the game felt a little lacking in the fun department. Maybe the decision space is a little too limited or familiar?

However, there's a lot of game packed into a little box.

RATING: 6
This game might be better than the rating I've given, though it gets dinged for unnecessarily difficult rules.  It should be pretty simple, ultimately, but there are all kinds of edge cases that we ran into that required us to guess at what to do.  We're pretty sure we got it right in the end, and knowing how to play now it seems like it can be fun.  But that first play was painful, and when I saw other groups playing I saw the same thing: people struggling to understand a simple game just because of the badly written rules.

Game is rather simple, but number of possible actions and limitation on having only two of them during your turn - makes it challenging. Not to the extent where you have decision paralysis - but initially it takes a while to get familiar with possible strategies. IT IS NOT A SIMPLE FILLER GAME :)

A clever little minimalistic game themed on the expansion of the Portuguese spice trade.  Players carefully use their small supply of cubes, that represent different things depending on where they are deployed - cash, victory points, ships, buildings, and so on.  The playing area is gradually revealed as cards are turned up, representing the expansion across the globe.  Fun for a few plays, and delightfully small and compact, but not a lot there once you've played it a few times.

Just a really clever game. I find I like the shorter, simpler games that still make space for some interesting decisions. This one definitely fits the bill. It's a bit of an engine builder, so (oddly) my only knock on it is that I wish it were longer because, just like RFTG, the game usually ends just as I get my engine really cranking.

Interesting small sized game with lots of choices and a well captured theme.
It would take some more games to find out if being 1st or 2nd player is a disadvantage.

[b][FirstImpression6thNOV2013][/b] I've had high expectations for this game. Being a micro game yet still being a strategy game really piqued my interest. After I looked at how it all set up, I really find it to looked really cool, you know with just about 25 cards and some cubes.

After I tried it for the first time, I think I'm right on track and it had what I expected. With just few components, and 6 different actions that you can do on your turn, it delivers what it promises. In my first game, there were few grunts during the decision making. We wanted to do a lot of things but there was always something else that you need to do first. 

Money is hard to get by and upgrades and placing cubes in Lisbon always cost you money. The use of cubes to represent multiple things are also unique. 

I don't know why the min player needed for this game is 3. Probably, in a 2p game, the tightness isn't there although it's playable.

Sail to India is another cracking game from Japan. It is a game of considerable depth and strategy, up there with any excellent mid-weight Euro, and yet played with only 22 cards,a bunch of cubes, and all housed in a tiny box the size of Hanabi. Clever stuff indeed. 

The mechanics are another moment of Japanese genius. Your cube is a building one minute, then a ship, then maybe a banker, an historian, or a bunch of goods. And the interesting thing is, you use one of these cubes to measure your VPs and another for your money. But if you get to 5 money or 5 VPs then you need another valuable cube to put on your bank or VP card...so the more successful you become, the fewer cubes you have to do other 'stuff', like sail or build or colonise. Very clever stuff indeed. 

Here is an excellent strategy game full of interaction, trading, shipping, colonising, building...and in a box you can fit in your back pocket. Very very clever stuff indeed. 

Let's hope AEG, who have picked this up, don't ruin its considerable charm with over-embellishment and a box full of air.

2016-12-26 : Minimalist engine builder that plays almost too fast : by the time you discover how all the parts relate to each other, the game will be over. We had some doubts about what was deemed an overpowered technology (harbour), but I'm not sure it really is. Needs another play, but is unlikely to stay in the collection as it's a bit too minimal for our taste.

RATING: 9.2
A slightly flawed gem.  The rules are airtight, especially the one about being able to return a token from anywhere to Lisboa "at any time".  The gameplay is as smooth as silk and lots of fun with meaningful decisions.

The only (very small) issue I have with it is that some technologies (almost, almost) never get purchased at the lower end (1-3 gold).  Nevertheless, it still shines.  If you decide you like it, I highly recommend TRADERS OF CARTHAGE.  It is also a super-micro-game where the cards have several purposes.  It is even more micro than Sail to India!

Also, the two-player variant for Sail to India using a 4-sided die works really well.  I recommend using the d4 at the START of each round in ANY game (2,3 or 4 players).  This eliminates the pure "Race-to-India-and-do-nothing-else" strategy.  Check it out in the variants forum.  Also, you should use the rule that only ONE card can be discovered per round.

Tetszett a téma, tetszett a kompakt megvalósítás, tetszett a némileg rendhagyó játékmenet a kockák körforgásával. Az ára viszont rémes, talán még nem láttam láttam ennél drágább játékot komponensre lebontva. Egy játék után kicsit kiegyensúlyozatlannak tűntek a fejlesztések is. Mivel csak hármat építhetsz így nincs túl sok értelme a kicsikkel vacakolni. A nagyok közül meg az akció nélküli építés irreálisan erősnek tűnt, mert bármelyik épületért pontot adó mellérakva hatalmas előnyt ad.
Fura volt még a játék vége feltétel is. Nem nagyon ri meg befejezni a játékot, mert a többiek még kapnak egy kört. Így viszont nagyon nagy előny elsőként elfogyasztani a kockáidat, mert onnantól kezdve senki más nem akarja a sajátját kipörgetni.

Akár 8-as játék is lehetne, de ezek a kezdeti imba dolgok nálam, kicsit 7 alá vitték, ami persze további játékokkal még változhat.

Sail to India is another microgame with a surprising amount of game in just a few cards and cubes, and having to allocate your cubes for multiple uses (ships, money, score markers) is quite the dilemma.

Ultimately, though, the strategic space does not really expand much beyond the "micro" scale. In effect, you have a handful of more or less obvious strategies prebuilt into the game (primarily fueled by the available technologies), and as a player you need to select one of these and ride it as hard as possible. It works but there is little opportunity for surprises along the way, and little overlap in the strategies so that interference is a costly endeavour in many cases.

Neat game, considering it all fits in a tiny box. I was expecting something a little more meatier, actually, considering the many comments that suggest this.  It turns out there is some decent weight to this, with very little luck, but it can feel a little repetitive and long for what it is. What was most intriguing was cubes that can be used as buildings, merchants, etc. , are also used for tracking coins and VP; so if you're desperate for a worker, you can take your coin marker off its card and use it as such. That was a very intriguing idea for allocation. Otherwise, I was happy to finally play it but I don't think there's a lot to explore after the first couple of plays.

Sail to India is the perfect example of minimalism in game design. Minimalism not being simple, but minimalism being the act of doing a lot with a little (like the toilet paper commercials - less is more!). I greatly admire Sail to India for what it accomplishes with its small size and quick play time, but the game feels quite bland and repetitive (especially in the first half, as players are repeatedly sailing out and selling 3 or 4 goods over and over until they're ready to start exploring further). I would love to see this design implemented into something with a bit more flavour!

This is one fine and IMHO highly underestimated, light strategy game with multiple pathes to victoy.  Games with multi-functional cards are nothing new but this has multi-functional meeples.  Depending on their actual position, a cube may be anything: a ship, a building, a trading good, victory points, money and more.  My favorite aspect of this game are the fine dependencies between the player's moves.  Not a grain of multi-player solitaire here: timing is critical as well as constantly monitoring the other players goals.  My favorite (German-language) Essen releas 2014 by now.

A lot of play for a limited number of cards, a few cubes and some rules, Sail to India is a reprinted microgame from Japan, which features minimal components but maximizes the use of them.

Players use two cards each to track money, victory points, move, and available tech builds. The game board is made up of 3 tech cards with 4 advancements on each, and port cards, where buildings and goods are available, plus one Lisbon home card.

Players have a limited set of colored cubes which serve either as trackers, buildings or as ships.

Ship cubes are easily re-purposed, but other cubes tend to be locked in place, which means that at some point players will run short, or run out.  Managing the stock of cubes in pool, in port, and on the cards becomes a key part of play, and is one of the endgame conditions.

Racing other players to Tech, to Ports, to deployment of cubes is all part of the game, yet managing the cubes for the greatest total worth is the decider, so is it worth setting up one more play, or too risky...?

It's a terrific little civ game for what it is, essentially a very small package Navegador, and it packs quite easily.

The AEG version is nicely done, and this is a game that I am sure will see some travel and some play going forward.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (June 2014)

In general, I don’t have much faith in AEG games so Sail to India was a welcome surprise. This is the game I was expecting 8 Minute Empires to be (although considerable longer). Love the way the game convert workers, they can be historians, bankers, sailors or buildings. You can actually lose VPs or money if you don’t plan for it.

It can be taught under 5 minutes and played under 45 minutes with fast players. It has some interesting decisions and down time is low. 

I dislike the nonstandard cards size, they are harder to sleeve but I managed. Also I’m worried about the Harbor technology, it seems very powerful.

Bottom line, I will play again and come back to re comment and re rate. For now I’m keeping Sail to India in my game collection and I want to play again.

After more plays, I continue to have Sails to India´s rating steady. It isn’t a bad game by any means, however I almost always prefer to play something else so I will probably sell the game. The theme does nothing for me. The harbor technology is very powerful, but not overpowered as I previously thought.

A very neat design in a very small package, AEG edition nicely produced too.

Game itself centres around managing your cubes efficiently, and while in a longer game that's not something I'd look out for with the short game time here it puts a lot of (good) pressure on the players as the game can close out very quickly. 

You need to be flexible as there are opportunities for blocking so you need to come up with a plan B quickly if someone baulks your plan A just before your turn.

This is a light game with maybe just a little more depth here than a filler. I'm not sure how much replayability this has. There are a few strategies you can take somewhat depending on how you invest in the tech track. Only a single person can have a tech so everyone seems to focus on a different strategy. This makes me suspect that after a few plays one ideal strategy may be discovered. It did seem like you could potentially block a player if you were doing well by buying a tech that would block their end game scoring. So maybe that could add to the variety. The art on the cards was nice and the game is inexpensive and comes in a small box. Maybe it would be a good filler. I won this as a door prize at Diecon.

Clever multiple usage of player cubes as ships, building markers, resources in actual gameplay while needing the same cubes for counting VPs and money. Each counter can only score up to 5 money or VP. When scoring a 6th VP or money, one of the active cubes has to be taken from the 'board'. An interesting dilemma. 
Mechanically, players choose 2 actions out of 6 every turn. Various strategies are possible. Focus on sailing and earn discovery points, sell goods for money and VPs, earn VPs from building churches. Technologies can be bought to support each strategy. 
It might be due to inexperience but the harbour master technology bonus was so strong that we didn't see any chance to stop it. The player who bought it, used it two times each round for 2 VPs and additionally discovered one new card for another VP.

A surprisingly meaty game in so little space.

The basic framework is very simple and solid, but with a twist of needing to use worker cubes also as your vp and money tracks is neat enough to warrant having a look at the game, but wouldn't carry it alone. Luckily the viable strategy space seems large enough that it'll be interesting to explore further.

Liked it more with 4 than 3.

Very good, polished game. I particularly like the idea that you need a historian to chronicle your VPs. Simple and elegant mechanics.

Surprisingly deep and complex game in such a small box. Part of the complexity is trying to get your head around the fact that your cubes function as anything and everything depending on where they are located. It plays really quickly for such a deep and complex game and there seems to be a lot of ways to go in the strategic level, but this may just be a bad assumption based on scratching mere surface. I do hope that StI is not suffering from too dominant sailing strategy and other possible killer combos. In the end the game is a bit too dry and repetitive. Blue and green colored cubes are a bit too close to each other in the Japanese release.

The small box contains an engine game with a limited spatial element, technologies and other investments, and different paths to victory. You make money from sending out and calling back ships, which involves some blocking and trying to stay out of phase. I'd feel better about all this if it didn't seem that actions were fairly straightforward once each player's point-making ways are locked in. Also I won my first game by spamming Harbor Maintenance, which was hardly inspiring. Would play again though. Commendably compact; compare with Splendor which has about the same amount of stuff but comes in a big box.

One play.  Impressive amount of game with just a few cards and a handful of cubes.  A great example of the "Japanese Minimalist" movement of games.

I might pick up a copy.  Will depend on how the reprint is handled.

The basic game mechanic how this game uses cubes for limitations is excellent and unique. The rest of the game needs more surprises and especially different kind of ways to get your points and what strategies to choose. So not the instant hit imho although I think with some more tweaking this could be next big hit.

Played once, 3p.  I would not call this game bad, and works fine as a filler - so long as everybody knows what they're doing.  I felt the game wore out its welcome at the 75% point, but the next game should go faster.

RATING: 5
I think this is a clever micro-game that is dense enough for a light game.  However, I think the mechanism that forces you to pay for cubes in Lisboa in order to use them as "adminstrative or bookkeeping" cubes on both the Gold and VP tracks, is NOT a bad rule.  It slows down the game and does not make it intuitive for those learning to play and is absolutely unnecesseary.  It loses me here whereas I like the rest of the game but won't play b/c of this quirky factor.  Why not just use black (neutral) cubes to allow all players to use as trackers?

Excellent, meaty filler where workers serve as point markers(historians), currency(bankers), sailors and more.  The way the actions weave in between the worker quantity as well as adding in technology capabilities is really clever.  Highly recommend this little gem!

This is meant to be a quick little game of engine building, and it's not bad, though it's really hard for a new player to see how he's supposed to even get started, given the limited resources. There's an interestingly frustrating mechanism where you need to have a cube "available" to assign to money or VPs, so your resources keep getting gobbled up. The technologies, except for the ones that grant bonus VPs seem to be a little "who cares?", though I got some mileage out of the Harbor Master. This was pretty interesting and I'm looking forward to seeing more of it.

A light, exploration, civ filler game.  It is a very simple Euro where you are moving ships to locations to gather goods and trade them.  You can also research to provide you with advantages and build building to get other advantages and victory points.  The game requires you to move markers to cards and you can win.  It can run long if you play slowly, but if players take turns quickly should end in a reasonable amount of time (i.e. 30 min).  I like the game and is more interesting filler than Eight Minute Empire.

I want to like this but it just seems like cube pushing for the sake of it.

It is clever that it is small and I appreciate the design but you need some theme for something like this. I don't need it to be small. There is no time when this smallness is an advantage. With love letter or dobble small is an advantage because it will be played out and about. This is too heavy for out and about play.

I shouldn't think, oh this cube here becomes this or that. It's not satisfying or real to me.

[b]There's a lot of game in that tiny package! Fun to explore different strategies/approaches. Has a lot of "Want to play again to try xy" appeal. Good length - not too long, usually not too much AP but also not so short that it feels like it's over before you've done anything.
The biggest downside so far is that it takes a while to explain all the rules and I can see losing some potential players halfway through the rules explanation.[/b]

A fun little card and cube game with some interesting and unique mechanics.

Each person takes on the guise of a Portuguese explorer trying to find a water route to India.  Sure the theme is tired and overdone, but this game uses it well.

Each player has to manage their cubes which act as everything in the game.  If you earn money you need a cube free and employed to become the banker.  If you want a ship, you have to first employ a cube then he can be used as a ship.

As you move along the path of cards, they overturn offering you different trade goods.  The more different goods you manage to trade the more money and VP you get.  Once two players are out of their cubes or someone has reached the last card "India" the game stops and points are counted up.

In our play through one of the guys managed to get two technologies that allowed him to barrel through the cards to India.  He slaughtered us.  A bit unbalanced but I'd try it again.

07/05/14 Played a four-player game in 1.8 hours (which was much longer than I'd anticipated from the "60 mins" on the box). The player aid was pretty good, but left off some things that there was obviously room for (e.g. buildings cost 2 gold each). I see no excuse for things like this considering this is the revamped A.E.G. edition (as opposed to the original Japanese effort). The rules were more complex than what I'd expected for a "small" game. The graphics were fine. I'd been planning to buy the game. So I welcomed this "try before you buy" opportunity. But now I'm not all that hot and bothered to purchase it. Its OK, but not as good as I'd hoped.

What a brilliant little game. It's compact, got quite a nice gameplay and it's interactive enough (above the average eurogame). It even has got enough theme! I'm amazed how much game there is  with so little components.

In a way it reminds me of cardgames where a card can be used for a variety of things, (Glory to rome, San Juan, RftG etc.) but in this game it's the cubes that really can be used for a variety of things, (but totally different than that standard euro 'trade this cube for another cube or point' kinda thing)

This is a remarkably big game in a remarkably little box.

This is a mid-light euro with quite simple rules, very simple components, and a surprising amount of strategy, though it is heavily tactical.  I see comments referring to this as a filler, but I think it's heavier and longer than that.

The rules are all fairly intuitive and straight forward.  The first play requires some mental discipline to keep from messing up the "move" action, and the rotation of marking cubes can be tricky at first, but both of these things fall away quickly.

The game clips along very well, and has a pretty short play time, certainly within an hour, and yet there are a lot of decisions to make, tactics to consider, and quite a few strategies to pursue.

Update: After 6 plays, I continue to see interesting moves and combinations of tactics.  I do think I *might* be barely glimpsing the peak of the strategic possibilities, but only more games will tell, and it could well be that once I've figured out an "optimal hybrid strategy" that someone will be able to counter it.  Just heavy enough, just fast enough, good player interaction, very tight engine building game.

Update 11/6/15: On my 13th play, I performed a strategy none of my group has fully used yet.  Nice to see some continued subtle tweaks available.  The various people I play this with know the game incredibly well, but we continue to love it.  Just bumped my rating to 8.5.

[Okazu version] [Blue-Green cubes  look-a-like is terrible!]

Just my cup of tea. A lot of game in a small box, aka a boardgame disguised as a card game.

I thoroughly enjoy the pace of the game where every player attemps to build up a small VP engine. Although players may actively hinder each other [or should I have said: take the wind out of each others sails], there seem to be multiple possibilities to set up such an engine.

My only worry is that some strategies may prove stronger than others ....

Packs a big punch for such a compact game. What struck me having learned this in the same week as Myrmes is how both games end around the time that escape velocity is reached, i.e., when your engine grows so powerful that it threatens the fabric of the game. It also reminded me of Puerto Rico, the way that there is a kind of choreography -- one player makes a suboptimal move in order that the next is forced into a suboptimal move as well... (and then the player who doesn't get this gives the player who follows the win). I found it really innovative that you must spend your workers in order to track VPs and currency -- really nice, unexpected twist on the "worker stock" mechanic (Notre Dame, El Grande, Louis XIV)

[b]Sail to India[/b]

[i]- Love the cube management, basically they are your ships, traders, scientists, bankers and historians (score keepers) which leads to lots of tough decisions to make when you are taking actions.
- Appears to be lots of replay value, especially due to the different technologies you can invest in which lead to different ways to score.
- There is a decent amount of player interaction since there is a limited number of buildings, resources and technologies.
- Nice production: the artwork is okay, I really like the over sized cards.

Looking forward to playing this again, not sure if I would buy it because the minimum player count of 3. I know my son would enjoy it, but I don't know if my wife and daughter would dig it. Since guys in both groups I game with own it, it is really not a priority. (Although the game is cheap!)[/i]

An interesting build-up game. Sail your ships out, earn gold, build more ships. Repeat. Once you have gold-earning capability, then you start spending it on ways to earn VPs. Which can be via tech tree advances (similar to Puerto Rico type powers really - factory earns more gold, bonus buildings that earn VPs for building this or that, etc) or sacrificing ships and turning them into buildings. Which means you'll need to buy more ships, and then you get the process going again, earning more gold. Which sounds a bit repetitive, but your turns aren't always straight-forward. There's a race to get to the techs first so you may need to spend early before it's ideal, and you may need to launch ships earlier than wanted because someone else is about to launch. If it weren't for those meddling kids, everything would be much easier. As such, the decision making seemed interesting enough to sustain a few plays, with different paths to explore based on your tech tree choices.

RATING: 8
"Almost a microgame, but plays more like a meaty euro. Cube management is an awesome twist, and the game offers several combos and paths to victory. The low price and small box make it a total keeper. This could become a 9 for me."

What I like:
- LOVE the cube management!
- Tiny box, few components, simple rules
- Plays pretty quickly (4p learning game in 45 minutes)
- Multiple paths to victory; several combos available
- Not too aggressive (although there is interaction)

What I don't like:
- The rule summary could be a bit more detailed?
- Slightly hard to remember to keep stock cubes separate
- Would love to see a different set of techs
- Why doesn't it have a 2p variant!?
- In my first game, I was forced into a kingmaker position

This game intrigued me from the first time I heard about it. I knew I would respect it, but wasn't sure I would enjoy it. My first game was a lot of fun, and I could see all kinds of things I would do differently next time. It packs a ton of game into a small deck of cards and a small bag of cubes. 

I would put the weight around 2.4, which is a bit higher than BGG voters. That's due to depth, not complexity.

Quite thinky, but it is interactive, because blocking ports is nasty. To have a plan is important here!

I don't like to refer to games as "little", but this is a lot of game, packed into a tiny package. 

I like the way you're forced to make decisions that will take your cubes off to become historians (record VPs) or bankers (record $). 

Do you think you can be the one to race it in to India, or are you content to capture the VPs available on the board and let someone else get those "Discovery" VPs?

*Played 2P once. Decent, but I do feel it wants the 3-4 it says on the box.

A nice mechanic of having you cubes count for everything. From points and money counters to ships, buildings and trade markers. So you must time and manage everything in order to best use your cube markers. You sail and place your cubes on goods and buildings in order to be able to trade for money or develop techs for extra points. Timing is very important as your cubes will move around a lot.

This one is component-light in the tradition of Japanese micro-games, but the gameplay feels more like a medium Euro. You're operating a trading company out of Portugal, and you sail along the queue of cards, stopping to claim goods or buildings. Your pawn at that point becomes that good or building, so you have to create a new ship to advance again. It really becomes a game about managing your pawns, as not only do you need them to claim items in the card queue, but also to mark your money and even victory points.

The micro-game craze has been hit or miss for me, but Sail to India is much more hit than miss. It’s pretty surprising that with just a small number of cards and a few cubes, there can exist a modern game with interesting choices. In the game, cubes will represent a number of different things depending upon their location. They can be ships that sail along a row of cards, turning new ones face up. They can move onto those cards to become goods that can be sold for points and money. Cubes can also build the building pictured on the cards. Most interestingly, though, the cubes are necessary to track income and points. Players start the game with no cube on the point track, and when scoring points, must choose to take the cube from somewhere else, thus limiting further options.

A decent enough euro game in a very small box. This has trouble getting to the table because it's strictly 3 or 4 players. While the game seems to have many paths to victory, exploration is the easiest way to get points and it also is one of the endgame conditions. If it's a race game, then this is a feature. If it's a 'all strategies are equal when executed effectively' then it's slightly unbalanced.

Sail to India is a "pick up and deliver" game with a unique mechanic in that the same token, which needs to be brought into the game through payment, can be used either as a ship, as a trade good, as a building marker, or to track wealth / victory points. That you can lose accruable wealth or victory points if you haven't planned enough to have such a marker available when needed adds some depth to the game. 

This game lasts only 25-30 minutes but packs quite a bit of punch for a game of that duration. Is there luck? Some, in terms of the order of cards that represent coastal cities discovered. But good strategy is at the heart of the game. I've not played enough to say what will happen if all players choose to follow the same strategy (for eg. if everyone upgrades ship speed to 3 as soon as possible) but I suspect it will only increase the planning element as then the path to victory will be more obscured and require some inspired thinking.

Quirky game of exploration and kind of pick up and deliver. Each player has cubes that do multiple things, including scoring money and VP, and you need to be able to move cubes from the main board to the score board when you receive income or points, and if you can't, then you don't score. A lot of game in a small box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Magnificent that somebody put so much game in such a small box. The game consists of a couple of cards and a few cubes only. The cubes can be goods, ships, technology, victory points, money or a building. It depends on the position.
The rules are pretty straightforward and the game plays fast. I really enjoyed this game. A shame that the green and blue cubes are too similar in color. I will mark some cubes with black dots, I think. Nice experience with so few components.

Scratches the same cerebral itch as Splendor, another minimalist card-based VP-engine building game. Not as dry as Speldor; much of the additional flavour is the vider variety of things to do as well as more different kinds of technologies.

To me, mircogames such as Sail to India are becoming synonymous to disposable games. I doubt the replayability of this game. As many VP-engine building games, once you have picked your technologies, you go on auto-pilot. In addition, player interaction is limited, and with a choice of pursuing your strategy and getting in the way of an opponent, the former is almost always the better choice. 

Surprisingly thematic, I think, because there aren't any base mechanics, like worker placement, that to me get in the way of theme implementation.

Still, if this game went down to two players, I'd consider buying it as its quick playing time and compact size are big plusses.

I've only played this twice so far, over a year apart from each other, but I have found it to be a very interesting game, apparently card-based but really cubes are the central resource. You see, in this game, cubes are what you need to do absolutely everything - they represent your boats, your buildings, and are needed to record the technologies you have, as well as how much money and victory points you have. Yes, even if you perform an action that awards you victory points, you won't get any without having a cube available to record them! And what is more, the VP and money tracks only go up to 5 - if you score more, you need a second cube on that track. This makes for a really interesting resource-management game of a totally different type. Not a classic game by any means - I'm not desperate to play again, but would very much enjoy doing so nonetheless. Perhaps it's not all that replayable, but it's very interesting at first (and perhaps for longer).

An engine building game with few components (deck of cards and cubes) where the limitations are imposed by the limited cubes one has.  Cubes serve to track VPs, Money, Goods, Buildings, and Ships so players will need to be efficient in their action point use.  There are a couple ways to get VPs - large trades, buildings, or exploration so players are competing to force the game end while having more VPs than others.  First play did run a bit longer than I expected, need more games to see if that was just learning the game or a more persistant feature of the game itself.

Game Field Edition has a nice improvement - scientists (3 cubes set aside in other versions) are removed and technology gains are represented by buying a technology card (limit 3 per player) instead.  Ergonomically, I think this is better than using 3 more cubes as Okazu and AEG edition of the game.

RATING: 8
Fast, clean, subtle, and appears to be deep.

There appears to be a lot of emergent depth from the game, and some delightfully clever interactions between the mechanics (since you have to use the same pool of cubes for tracking stats and performing actions, you have to make neat choices every turn about your priorities).

I think it is pretty neat that the design contains so much relative to the tiny package. The game succeeds as a kind of thought experiment, kind of one of those "here is a piece of tape, some yarn, four paper clips and a shallow vase. Make us a game. Ready...GO!" But missing from Sail to India--in all that WAS crammed into its little box--was the FUN :(
UPDATE: Interesting to see how the reviews of this game have deteriorated so sharply over time. Is the shine off of the Japanese designer movement? I think, and hope so. I loved it when it was Love Letter, "but, I mean, all right, you outgrow it, you absolutely outgrow it."  ;)

A neat medium tasting game in a little box. If only there was a less fiddly way of doing the bookkeeping and pulling back the leaders than is currently done with the cubes. (I bet there is.) Too many cubes to be shuffled around to come in at a social game weight - you'll have to concentrate or you'll stuff up and you've run out of cubes to add victory points or take all your income. It's sufficiently simple in the rules department, but it just misses the mark a bit with the fiddling.

Nice - I'm not sure how many replays this has, but it fits nicely in my collection for a portable game that comes in easily under an hour. The technologies are certainly a nice feature. The race for markets creates some good tension, but the buildings could be more varied because they're currently too numerous to matter much beyond VP end of game bonuses through your technologies. Only three buildings is a little dull and having more building types linked to each technology purchase might be a bit more interesting.

Inspiring and has the potential to be refined into an excellent little game in a small box. Some concerns to be tested - Harbour Maintenance seems cheap for the VP you can get out of it - but as a little game it's not too shabby at all. A game I'm warming to quickly.

Played twice with 3P. Sail to India achieves remarkably deep gameplay with minimal components. In a way, it compresses the decisions you make in an average Euro into a tiny package. Unique to this game is the cube management aspect as the limited cubes serve as ships, building markers, VP and money.

Despite all that, this game lacks a distinct fun value. Yes, there are aspects of multiple VP paths, resource management, tech upgrades and even a race thrown in, but it is no greater than the sum of its parts. Sail to India does a great job of miniaturising several Euro elements, but unfortunately never moves beyond that to give the game a hook of its own.

Surprisingly good game for something that fits into a box of this size. I especially like the idea of using the same cubes for workers, money and victory points.

I really can't quite put a finger on what it is that prevents me from really liking this game, especially as a neatly sized travel companion with decent gameplay, but if I had to be honest with myself, I probably would have to admit that it is mostly the card design. I hate to admit it, but if this had cards in bright primary colours rather than this gloomy mixture of grayish turquoise, grayish red and grayish ochre, I think I would be more excited about it. And I actually just noticed a new edition on boardgamegeek that seems promising in this regard.

2 plays

Very cool game, especially given the tiny size! With just a bunch of cards, some player boards, and some cubes, you have a lot of interesting things happening even though the game plays pretty quickly (about 30 minutes for us, after rules). I really like how you have to work your cube economy: the more you do to get points/money, the less you can do (because of limited cube availability).

[b]--- Summary---[/b]
The "board" is a row of 12 explorer cards, the first 3 of which are face up. Lisboa is to the left of this, and 3 tech cards (12 techs). The explorer cards show some type of goods, and 2 buildings. Everyone starts with some money, 3 cubes in their Tech Research box, and at level 1 Sailing, both tracked on their personal boards with cubes used as markers..

[u]On your turn[/u], take 2 actions. These can be any combination of:
- Hire: spend money to get new cube (from Supply) in your color; place on Lisboa. If you spend your last money, that cube also goes to Lisboa.
- Sail: move each of your ships (cubes below the cards in the row) up to your Sailing level in either direction along the card row. If advancing to face down card, flip it and score 1 VP. Then, may take control of one of one of the two types of goods shown (move cube from ship location to goods icon), or buy one of the buildings on that card (spend gold, move cube from ship location to the building).
- Sell: sell sets of different goods (for money) by moving cubes off the icons, larger set = more money; spent cubes go to Lisboa.
- Tech: use one of your Tech cubes, pay cost (cash), and learn a tech: place your tech cube there (max 1/player).

Buildings: 3 types ...
- Market: 1VP. Each one matches one of each type of goods in game; when making sales, counts as a virtual good of that type
- Cathedral: 2VP
- Stronghold: 1VP. When sailing from Lisboa, may move cubes to Stronghold for free, then sail.

Cubes: Flow from Stock to Lisboa, never back. Once in game, spent cubes (e.g., last money) go to Lisboa. If cube needed (e.g., to mark VP), take from Lisboa. 

Techs: modify the rules some way, giving you some additional power; also, 3 of them award extra VP, 1 per building type.

[u]End of Game[/u]
When 2 players acquire all their cubes from stock, or if someone explores the last face down card, finish the round (?or everyone else gets one more turn?). Then, most VP wins.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Abstraction taken to a whole new level. Place cube, move cube, score cube. Each time players touch in one cube it changes its name: ship, good, cathedral...

It's challenging enough but overly dry.

Love how simple the components are (cards and cubes) and how portable it is.

But exploration is definitely too strong. Seriously needs some adjustment.

Edit: Gave it another chance and I'm probably just going to get rid of this. I really like how harsh some of the game's mechanics are, where you have to use workers to keep track of your money and victory points but everything is too tight where exploration isn't. The game just doesn't work.

Micro games are all the hype if you can believe the talk on BGG. For me they are not. Sure, I like them, but to me they're mostly just a sub genre of the filler and super filler genre. I won't seek out games simply because they are micro games.
OK, on to this game: it has about 30 over sized cards or so and a couple of cubes. You can move your ships to different locations, build markets, churches or fortresses or trade to get money. Money which you can use to upgrade your abilities or build markets churches or fortresses. You score points by trading lots of different goods or by buying special bonus 'buildings' which grant you points based on certain achievements.
It all works fine, it's a very solid design and I'll be happy to play it again, but I don't feel it is different enough from some other similar games to require owning this.

I can't imagine how more game could be packed into such minimal components. Tight resource management is required, and there is plenty of player interaction in this surprisingly deep gamer's game that plays in 30 minutes.

[thing=141736][/thing] is a strategy game that mixes a lot of mechanism: work placement, set collection, movement and action points, while also being almost a micro-game: 24 cards, 4 reference cards and 52 multipurpose cubes.

[thing=141736][/thing] showed itself as a good game: it has a fast resolution, offers interaction between players without agression, and allows for constant decisions, although none are truly difficult to be made. There is evolution in the game state, with the development of ship speed, of technologies, by the construction of buildings, and even by bringing more cubes into play, which allows for more options. Replay value can be an issue, since all the technologies are available in all games, and the only thing that changes in the order of the cards to be discovered, however this doesn't affect the game feel and progression all that severely.

While not being brilliant, [thing=141736][/thing] fits nicely inside that room of 30-45 minutes for a quick game with choices - a filler with meat in the bones, with a good level of indirect interaction, producing some complexity, without much overhead. It won't ever be the "game of the night", the one people will schedule and call in to play, but will serve well enough to fill the gaps between those.

With one play, it is quite tough to give an objective comment, but at first blush, this game suffers from lack of diversity of actions in the first few turns as turn order appears to dictate what players can afford to do in the first round. As one player noted, there appears to be an illusion of choice each turn, but really the selection is quite limited given the options at hand. Money is tight and seems to be required for many if not most options. The only way to earn an income is via trading goods and once those spots are occupied, there is a dearth of options. Without money, many of the options are not available such as purchasing technology, upgrading sails, buying ships, buying buildings...etc. So, if everyone is fighting for money in the initial rounds, then turn order becomes crucial. There appears to be no viable method to overcome this shortcoming?

Perhaps after one play, this is too harsh and there are other strategies for success, but currently, it does not appear so even after one play. This game deserves a few more plays before giving a proper rating

Good game with little components. I like the idea that players need to buy a cube(historian) to score. This game looks having several lines to win. I bought a little technology for church, gaining 1 vp each turn. Then I won by this. I am not sure is it too powerful. I am curious, so if I have opportunity, I would like to try more.

There's a ton of game packed into this little, nondescript package. It's a very tight, efficiency, cube-pusher.  Set up mini engines, grab an end game scoring tech, maneuver around your opponents and try to come up on top.  

While I thought the design was very interesting, it doesn't really excite me.  I'm usually not too fond of these games where you're just trying to be more efficient than everyone else, and whoever can math out the game the best is going to win.  That's going to totally appeal to some people who are more into the puzzle of games than the experience, I imagine this is a great pick.

I also have trouble when these stripped down games fall into the hour playtime bracket.  While there are interesting decisions here, there are other games I'd rather play if I'm going to sit down for an hour.

very euro-y and challenging microgame

[+] tiny box, good challenge, multiple-cube-use mechanic, random setup, fast paced, short game
[-] a bit slow to start, some (c-)rushing strategies you must keep an eye out for and block (map + nothing but explore all the way to India mainly)

(Nov 2013 after 1 4p game) - A worker placement card game!   Your workers either are sailors, bankers or scorekeepers.    You sail to acquire goods, the bankers collect money when you sell and you are able to acquire skills.

Quite a bit of game in this tiny box.

For a game is a small box, there is a fair amount of game here.  It is a cube pushing do this to do that, type game, plays pretty intuitively.  Our first game was 3 players and we all tried different approaches and the score ended up being pretty close.  Nifty little game!  Gigantosaur coffin games could learn a thing or two from this game ;)

Very mechanical cube pusher. Nothing of any interest whatsoever.

There's a lot contained in this small box!  The game is mostly about timing and is effectively a worker placement game, but the way that you use your cubes for everything in the game, including tracking your score (and for each multiple of five in your score, you'll need to use another cube!) is novel.  It also seems fairly balanced with how you can get points, and how going after one tactic over another will keep you competitive in the game.  The person who can manage all avenues the best, though, will still likely be the winner.

Excellent microgame, probably the densest one that could be packed in such a small array of components (24 cards, a bunch of cubes). Probably should be just a 7, but I give it 1 more point because of the brilliant and novel idea of using the players' limited own cubes for keeping track of the money and score (an excellent catch-the-leader mechanic which doesn't seem forced at all).

This had a surprising amount of depth for a micro-game, with some clever mechanisms for tracking goods, boats, forts and income using only a handful of cubes. Sadly, it was still a micro-game, so after a few plays, it quickly became dull and repetitive.

An exciting microgame with a pretty original gamemechanic. You need your cubes to determine your actions but also to keep track of your score AND your money. Carefull planning is the key in this title. But I truly love it. And being a microgame it's a perfect travelgame.

Micro game to discover a route to India that is a thinky filler. Wow. Behold the multi purpose cube! Sail cubes from Lisboa and explorer the unknown. Use your sailing cubes to claim buildings or to collect resources for cash. Use cubes to boost your technology. Novel idea to have scoring and wealth tracks with max limits for each cube placed on the track. A brilliant balancing act with your finite number of cubes and timing judgement when to shift from one use to another. So much game in a little box.

A small game that packs a lot of rules, which were not too well-written and lacked clarity. Theme wasn't really there. Story arch wasn't really there. The game mechanic made up for the above, but only just.

1st play: I came into this with very low expectations but the game is actually pretty good.  The main board has a spatial building aspect where you're trying to get big resources of your own type and not allow anyone else to get too big.  Your personal board is a bit of knowing when to go for the big score vs when to cave and just get any points at all.  Turns are fast and decisions are tough.  Good game and plays quickly.

2nd play: Yep - a keeper.  The two sides of the board have very different feels in terms of tightness and how aggressive to be with tiles.  It's easy to block each other off, but the tile draw adds some random to the game so that you can't always do exactly what you want.  Plays well 2-4 players and in about an hour, a great game to finish the night off with.

An abstract game where the theme isn't even pasted on: they simply forgot to include it. Each player-board has the name of a different town: other than that, they're identical. Hands down, the worst-themed game ever!

A dry spatial puzzle that drives me up the wall. It's deeply strategic, yes; but there's too much luck-of-the draw to make any strategy necessarily effective. Can't stand this game......

......then why, oh why, am I so eager to play it again? I'm seriously wondering if it improves with a multitude of plays.

This tile placement, set collection game isn't going to surpass Carcassone (our favorite tile placement game) or Morels (our favorite set collection game) anytime soon but it's still fun. You place tiles to gather resources then use those resources to place other tiles in order to make sets to get points. A cool mechanism is that after you've used all the resources the other players in order get to use what is left over. But the component quality is a bit off, whoever designed the tiles placed in the resource grid apparently neglected to make sure everything was cut right so the more the board fills up the more the tiles are pushed out of line. And the scoring is soooo fiddly. So good but probably could have been better.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
The game has some really nice components.  The player boards are a super high gloss, with thick cardboard (and no warping).  Game also offers some really tough choices, which at many points in the game can be AP inducing.  I think 2p is perfect for this one, and 3p MIGHT work (never 4p...).  The game does offer two game boards to play, which does offer some stuff to explore, but I'm not sure if this one will stay interesting past a few plays.  One that I will probably keep for awhile, as it was a fun 1 hour 2p game, but this will probably be forgotten by 2015...

Games like this are why Euros get a bad rap.  This is basically an abstract puzzle game.  The crux of the design is based on your spatial reasoning skills.  It's just too bad that it's just not that much fun.  This game is prone to brutal AP.  The production is also garbage.  The cardboard tokens don't even fit on the board properly.  This game is destined to get forever lost in the realm of shitty Euro games.

Just read the rulebook.  Tile laying game where each round a resource tile with 4 icons is placed on a community board and the connections of those icons to icons on adjacent tiles determines how many of the 4 resource types are available to build building tiles on your personal board.  End game points are based on completed rows and columns on your boards.  2 add'l interactions -- any left over resource types can be used by other players to build buildings and you get new building tiles based on how many resources are at 0 at the end of your turn (after players may have used some of the remaining).  

Looks like a 45 minute innocuous game with a lot of player interaction.  I'm not crazy about the screens, but it may be possible to play with the tiles in hand.  Figuring out what harvest tile to play and where/how to place is the guts of the game and looks like it may be prone to AP, 

Recommendation: Try Before Buy but potential buy if the price is low.

Just blase about this one. The theme is very tacked on, and the gameplay doesn't excite me. Tile laying in order to match up resources then used to build with. Buildings score points at game end for a player completing an entire row or column on his player board. Opponents can piggy-back off of left-over resources not used during the active players' turn. Meh.

A combination of tile laying, resource management, and tableau building in this really abstract game. Dry theme is pasted on. The tableau building and resource management is the best part but the random draw and tile placing for resources doesn't present interesting decisions.

Abstract spatial relationship game with an element of luck (tile drawing).  Probably good for families seeking a more advanced game yet one that is still reasonably simple to learn and get going.  Disappointing as a gamers game, and somewhat long with 4 players.  Impulse purchase at Essen 2013 without playing or studying and slightly regretted as a result.  Suspect my non gaming friends will find this overly long for what it delivers.

Very good tile placement game.  So much to think about when placing tiles.  The hard decision to know when to flip a building, build it on its wild side and lose the opportunity to score double points is crucial.  Also there is the incentive to help your opponent while helping yourself.  Very good game.

An abstract game with absurdly irrelevant theme of colonial New Haven/New England.

It's an interesting design somewhat reminding Uptown where you try to put as many pieces as you can on your board in a way that maximizes your score.  In New Haven your goal is to get complete rows and columns.

It would've been a nice game if not the playing time, exceeding a few times declared 30min.  Had it been 1 hour, I wouldn't have complained, but it's closer to 2.  Still, I'll give the game the benefit of a doubt (and a '6' rating instead of '5') and assume you could close in to 1h with some experience (and non-thinkers in your group).

This is a pretty good, light tile laying game. Each turn you lay a tile and collect resources that allow you to place buildings on your personal board. If you complete a row or column of buildings, it will be worth points at the end of the game. The tile placement is a puzzle, and the building placement takes some planning. Both of them take some luck.

What can I say about this game? I like te concept, it's a puzzle style game where you have to look at the possibilities of your opponent as well but for my opinion it's to luck driven. In the beginning you may draw 6 buildings that you may keep hidden. When you have the bad luck to draw 6 of one color and that color doesn't show up on the board the game is already over before it's even start. At the other hand, like the puzzle style a lot!

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable light/medium tile-laying game. There is certainly luck involved because for the most part you are drawing buildings and tiles blindly, but your challenge is to do the best that you can with what you get. The "B" side plays a bit quicker as there are less tiles to place, though it is a bit more challenging to build buildings due to that lakes that can break up your resource options.

Interesting game. Despite the luck factor attached to tile drawing I have won both the 2 player games which I have played which seems to indicate a level of skill involved. It is a simplistic domino game matching tiles to win tokens to fill out your own player grid. The game does involve thought over play - however because of luck with tile drawing there is very little pre-planning - just hope that your tiles appear and making the best with what you have got. There are some games released which you feel some more work and you could have released a more skilful game, this is one of them.

Nice tile laying game. Easy to learn, hard enough to play well. After ~5 games played I think, that the mini-expansion (charters) is must have because it brings more competition between players. That way you need to focus some early/ midgame strategy as well. Anyway, a good game which I'm ready to play every now and then. But keep in mind, that New Haven works best when played with three players - the fourth brings nothing else than longer game time.

This is an odd one. There's a big ol board, but it's only used for gathering resources. The other action happens on individual player boards. It seems like it would be low-interaction, but it actually does some interesting things I've not seen other games do. Only issue is that it exists in that nether realm where it's not quite meaty enough for a main course, but it's a little long for a filler.

Enjoyable short, light-ish but strategic game. It actually feels a tad like Key Harvest but with more generous placement rules (and obviously missing all that market business). Risk management is essential, as you don't know if you'll pick up the buildings you want. Knowing when to give up and play a building face down is a major decision in the game. I quite liked it. Too bad the production issues interfere with the game, but surmountable.

An abstract with a fun theme that is a total waste due it being purely abstract. Too much randomness, furthermore, esp. in tiles - you only have two to choose from. To ameliorate this you start with one joker, but I'm no fan of one big burst - it makes no sense and takes one even further away from the theme, were that possible. This part should be further developed.

It's a fun abstract with some good twists, but after 2 plays (a 3er and a 4er), I can't imagine wanting to play this many more times. It's a little off in the balance between play time and strategic variation (i.e., I think I'd play the same way given a starting hand, and each hand lasts more than 10 minutes). Where it hits kind of a sweet spot might be as an advanced gateway; played not for the thrillz but to help bring others into the fold.

RATING: 5
Rather dry, quite abstract. Game is too slow 4-p unless everyone really concentrates on fast play. Play a tile to generate income based on the number of matching terrain elements, spend to place "buildings" (round tiles). You need to get the right kind of income in order to build, and deny opponents the income [i]they[/i] want - this is the heart of the game, and it isn't terribly exciting. Building placement is constrained - colours have to go together, so there is some planning and simple drafting  
Components are printed in bright colours on high gloss card. It looks pretty but functionality is sub-par. Reverse sides of green and red disks ("building tiles") are very difficult to distinguish. Square resource tiles are too big for the board spaces.
[i]Spielbox[/i] magazine rated New Haven rather high. I can't imagine why.

I liked the novel way to generate resources, placing a tile (each quadrant generates a resource) and get resources equal to the size of each group of resources that it builds on. What and how many resources you want to generate is driven by the building tiles you've drawn, so there's some luck involved, drawing resource tiles that match your building tiles and vice versa. If you've got lots of matching buildings in resources you can get big groupings on, you can have a massive turn and build a ton of them. If you can't build big, try and close down the big resource groupings so that other players can't use them. I also liked the rule that any resources you can't use can be used by other players, so you try and generate only the resources you can use. Buildings in themselves have no powers, so this is purely a game of generating resources to fill in the spaces on your board with tiles that match those spaces. Which means precious little story arc or theme, and hence it's a little too abstract for my gaming tastes these days. Your results also seem likely to be heavily swayed by the luck of the draw, which seems a little incongruous for a themeless game. My take was that it's probably fine for a few plays, but there'd be little left to explore after that.

On the verge of a decent rating, but this game seems to pretend to have more strategy than it actually does. The way resources cycle around the players is neat, but tends to simply keep all of the players close in score, creating a very artificial sense of balance. I never really felt rewarded for my actions so much as going through the motions. Still, there is a little room for some tactical play.

A thinking tile laying game that rewards balance and timing. The theme is very weak in this one, but as an abstract game it's execution is somewhat refreshing. Acquire resources from a central board. Build four different coloured tiles on your personal board. Colours can only be built off the same colour, so you have to plan your path and building selection choices to optimise your growth. Buildings not matching the appropriate board number from 1-6 may be played in a non number matching position as long as the colours still match. However completed colours and rows with optimal matching builds will score double points.

New Haven reminded me of Ginkgopolis with its level of complexity and balance of acquiring resources, buildings and scoring taking opportunities. Ginkgopolis does it quite a bit better, but this is still worth a play or two if you don't mind spending about an hour on an abstract game that takes just a few minutes to learn.

2 plays

This is a pretty cool set-collection game with an added element of board play that limits your legal plays. I liked the 3er game more than the 4er, and not just 'cause I won -- you got more turns and had a little more control = more fun! Is it even better with 2, or does that too much of an abstract thinky affair?

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each have a personal board, a grid of rows/columns each worth 3-6 VP. The central board, also a grid, has several resource types showing on the corner spaces (a combo of wood, stone, sheep, and grain). A bunch of round tiles (in each type, numbered 1-6) are mixed in the bag, and 5 are placed on display. Players start the game with a bunch of these behind their screens, as well as 2 land tiles; the rest of the lands are in a face down random deck.

On your turn, place a land tile on the board and count the number of each resource produced = number on that tile, and all icons connected to matching icons on that tile. Then, may spend them to place the round tiles on your board:
- each costs as many resources as the row on the board
- must place adjacent to matching type of tile you previously placed (if any)
- must either play the same number tile as the number of the row, to play the tile face up, or play the tile face down
If any resources remain, other players (in turn order) may use them to place their own tiles. Then, for any resources down to 0 tiles, draw a replacement tile: the first one must be taken from the face up display, the rest may be taken from there or the bag. Replenish display at the END of your turn.

The game ends when the central board is full. Players score VP for each completely filled row and column; double value if all tiles are face up. Most VP wins!

Light medium game with very good components. Simple to learn with lots of randomness attached. I would prefer to play with a display of square tiles thus reducing some randomness.

A family strategy game with a pasted on theme. Where have we seen that before? But that doesn't have to be a knock on the game (for me at least). The rules are simple: place a tile and gain the resources on that tile and all similar resources connected to them. Then use those resources to build buildings on your personal board for which you will score points at the end. You score points when you have filled entire rows or columns with buildings and you score double if all of the buildings have the exact number on them.
The theme makes absolutely no sense but it's an enjoyable puzzle to figure out how to place the buildings to both optimize points and future possibilities.
I was slightly annoyed with the length of the game. You set goals for yourself and when you get them you feel good about that. But if the game goes on for 3 rounds after you've reached all goals you deem attainable, you're just scraping together a hand full of extra points that probably don't make a difference in the end scoring. I think most other players where in the same situation.

I thought I'd like this; and I do. Playing resource tiles in to a shared board which produces goods. You then get to use these goods to place stuff on the board, but any resources you leave are offered to others players to use. They can then use these to also build buildings out of turn. The choice for them then becomes whether they use all of the resources which in turn gives you extra buildings to potentially score with.

This was billed as a bit of a civ game.  I guess maybe.  But really, it's very abstract, and you build out on your own board trying to fill rows or columns with tiles based on the tiles played to a main board.  Everything in this game felt kind of forced.  It was interesting enough, but there just isn't anything there to make me come back.

Spend these resources to place drafted building tiles on individual village player boards that can earn different point combinations in rows and columns. Interesting mechanism to limit hoarding resources. Each turn use 'em or lose 'em to the next player! The village building puzzle is interesting but fairly abstract.

Before we went to Essen, I got interested in this game. The theme is nothing new. The mechanics aren’t refreshing at all. The artwork is what you would expect of a game like this. And still, it sounded very interesting to me. We were happy that we could play the game in Essen, so we could try it before we should consider buying it.

The game is easy to explain. A players turn takes a couple of steps:

    Place a harvest tile on the board
    Determine which resources are gathered and keep track of them on the resources track
    Build your village (spend resources to build a building tile on your personal player board)
    If there are resources left, other players may build a building on their personal player boards
    Draw new buildings
    Place all resource markers back to 0 and end your turn

At a first glance, it seems that there is a lot of luck involved in this game, and yes, there is luck involved. You draw harvest tiles. You draw building tiles. There is luck involved with that. But every player has the same amount of luck, so it doesn’t bother that much. Also, there is enough tactics possible to make this an interesting game.

In Essen they sold a small expansion for this game, which gave 7 additional ways to score at the end of the game. In my eyes, these additional tiles, should be available in the basic game, as they make the game more tactical and interesting. Anyway, this game is a very nice bridge between a family game and an expert game.

Abstract, smooth, enjoyable. A little more luck element in the draws, but still, plays very nice.

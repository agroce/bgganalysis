All kinds of awesome. There are so many different unit types and technologies and stuff, it's nearly overwhelming when you are playing for the first few times. You could do or build something different every game for quite a few games and still learn about the way different units interact and how well some units/technologies are in different situations. (though it seems that archons, battlecruisers, and ultralisks are the way to go most of the time)

The combat deck ROCKS. It's like a whole game of DOMINION thrown into a conquest-type game, only better, because instead of buying a card that lets you draw an extra card or that is a useless VP, you get a Nuke card, or a Stim Packs tech that beefs up your marines, or Increased Carrier Capacity so everyone fears your floating beehive of doom. The cards have a Magic-esque feel to them, too, how they each have an attack and health value and sometimes special abilities, or some of them are enchantments/support cards that boost your main dudes.
At first, I felt that you drew way too many combat cards during the game, but after a couple plays I saw that that isn't true at all; I only had a ton of combat cards when I was researching and not fighting. The rest of the time, you'll be attacking people and getting attacked and you'll lose your Ultralisk because you don't have a matching card or stuff like that.
Speaking of losing your Ultralisk, the cards do a good job of emulating unit health/shield levels, too. Let's say you have in your hand, 2 Ultralisk cards (one with health 9 and one with health 7) and a zergling card. Your Ultralisk gets attacked and you use your health 9 card to destroy some Terran meat. Later that turn, you get attacked again and use your health 7 card, but your Ultralisk just barely manages to survive the battle. If you are attacked again before you get another Ultralisk card, that 'lisk is probably dead. The cards are great at representing health levels AND energy levels (for special abilities). This is why the Zerg get to draw a card after each battle; it represents their quick natural healing. The Protoss draw extra cards when they are attacked as a representation of their shields.

The order placement part of the game is cool, though it is probably the most difficult rule for people to grasp at first. It lets people see where people are doing things at the start of the turn, but they don't know what they're doing or when they are doing them. You can even mess up other people's plans by placing your orders on other people's. Also, the way you spend resources is simple and intuitive and is great because it doesn't require bookkeeping. On the other hand, managing all your little worker tokens is annoying and can get "fiddly".

Unfortunately, all players need to be paying attention and trying to prevent everyone else from winning for the game to be tense and exciting to the end. The only thing I don't like about the game is the way the special victories can end it in a spectacularly anticlimactic fashion sometimes. (I'd like to try Brood War to see how it changes things, or try out Brood War's 'survival' variant win conditions)

One of the most fun things about the game is all the times you can quote the units from the PC game. You get to say stuff like ""My life for Aiur!!!" and "I'm about to drop the hammer, and dispense some indiscriminate justice!" One more good thing about the game is that it feels and plays like an epic "monster game", but you can fit it into a few hours.

Also, the minis simply rock; they have got to be the most awesome board game components I own. The only thing that keeps it from being played more is the high level of thinkyness it requires (and the accompanying mental exhaustion).

This is another big, sprawling FFG offering that will probably see the table about as often as Twilight Imperium (which is rarely). I like the battle mechanic in this one, and feel that there is a lot of depth in this, provided one can get it on the table frequently and explore. Alas, this may not happen here.

Have played several times now.  This one is going to last.  I love the planning phase, as it is unique and a real brain burner.  I love the endgame, as it dramatically changes things up with the special victories (which seem to be well balanced.)  It's just plain a lot of fun.

My only wish is that the battles went a little more quickly, but perhaps this will change with experience.

Starcraft is a solid game.  An FFG production with excellent components, it looks stellar on the table.  The order placement mechanic from "A Game of Thrones" is in place here, whereby you place orders in stacks and then resolve them top down, so you kind of have to think in reverse order, which is a little weird at first but later grows on you.

Combat is resolved through unit skirmish matchups and card plays, modified by keywords.  In practice, this works out very well and introduces a hand management aspect into the game.

In most of the games I've played, each player feels like they're still "in it to win it" until the last game turn.  You're always "this close" to having victory yourself when someone else pulls out the win.  This is largely due to special victory conditions, which flavor each faction differently.

The game is highly thematic, moderately complex, takes a while to play, has little downtime (mostly when other players are in combat), takes a ton of table space, is kind of lengthy to teach, and has excellent reference material.  It's a fun, interesting, and engrossing game that plays best with 4 or less, but can support up to 6 (which increases the table space required, the potential downtime, and game length).

Not a game I would own because like others of its ilk, I'd never get it to the table. But surprisingly, it's rather easy to understand if explained by an experienced player (the rules are far too intimidating otherwise). It has some whacky mechanics - e.g. the reverse action selection and the odd impact of units that are worthless without correspondingly great cards. It gives you some of the theme of the computer game and a bit of the flavor - but not the zest and excitement. It drags along too - over staying its welcome with more then 3-players. All in all, it's a fun time with loads of glitter and a big production - like an overproduced MGM musical.

This is a rather long game with soooo many rules that everytime you're in a mood to play StarCraft you have to read the rules booklet again.

I would use StarCraft: The Board Game as a study case how (not) to translate a computer game into a board game. On PC you have the CPU to do all the upkeep and bookkeeping for you while it also enforces the rules. When you play unplugged, you have to do all that stuff by yourself. And this is the greatest design flaw in this boardgame. 

StarCraft throws the players into a quagmire of rules, components and administrative tasks that have no end. 90% of the table time is spent on something else than playing, and of the remaining 10% majority is downtime (divide 10 by the number of players to get the approximate figure). 

This game relies only and solely on the shoulders of the most devoted fanboys who do not mind spending hours just reorganising fiddlybits over and over again. I love the computer game but most likely will not play this ever again, for it has one of the worst decisions to playtime ratios.

RATING: 7.6
Actually a very good game. Not too long, the victory conditions are achievable and the bits are the most detailed I've ever seen.
It is very aggressive and you are almost obliged to attack every turn, but apart from that it has a very modern euro feel about it. Particularly good is the way the combat decks work - you have a standard deck you draw cards from during combat, but buying technology adds cards to the mix, so there is an element of deck management to the game.
The races are quite different and the game is over in 2 hours, nicely done.

A good game but not for me.  The theme is excellent and surprisingly it accurately reflects the computer game.  I like the unit building and resource management.  The alternate (special) win-cons are a nice touch, though they don't appear to be entirely balanced.

The game I played took forever.  6 people, 6  hours, and we didn't even finish.  Granted, it was a learning game, but the rules are [i]very[/i] dense and often difficult to decipher.  Not for the faint of heart.  Also not really for young players.  Rounds take a long time with 6 people since you go around 4 times placing orders and 4 more times executing them.

Combat is okay.  It was done well, and is very true to the computer game, but it felt slow and somewhat tedious.

A good game, just too long and too complicated for my tastes.  I'm not sure I'll play this again, though I recommend others give it at least 1 try, particularly if you're a fan of the computer game.

RATING: 9
FAVOURITE GAME - It is an awesome game of space domination based on the Starcraft universe. You control either Terran, Zerg, or Protoss armies (there are two of each available) trying either to gather victory points or either trying t fulfill army specific vicroty conditions. Each turn starts by planning the actions, placing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. Then everyone has the chance to execute one order available at a time. The game has excellent quality miniatures of units known from the video game.

Best war game ever.
Really: it looks like a freaking ameritrash with tons of cool pieces and tokens. Actually Starcraft has got really low luck (set-up and Events Cards, stop).

Each faction is really different and guess what? All the factions are BALANCED. Yep, I said balanced.

Starcraft is for hard core gamers 'cause you need some plays to get deeply how it works and taste how it's good.

Really good stuff.

Does not feel like a wargamey/fighting game, did not feel the theme as a starcraft universe either.

Game play felt like another remix of RISK+Warcraft kind of gather/build and have a big fight with cards that somehow did not bland in too well with the battle effect.

Worst yet, it plays longer than warcraft, which makes the whole exercise frustrating.

Production wise is pretty good. beautiful minis and planets.

Eye candy with nothing in it.

This game has potential, but it also takes an absurd amount of real estate, for storage as well as play. It is a game you won't play often, making it one of the most expensive (on a per play basis) games out there. Beautiful bits, however, and if there had been more plastic figures in the box, I'd keep my copy.

I liked the game, interresting, the only drawback is the time required to play it, you need to plan a good part of the evening for it. My only game (to date) was with 6 players in teams, and while we found some problems with the way we played (don't know if we had all the rules right), it was fun.

The problems with the fragility of the game pieces is real and a bit of a problem with the game. While I had 1 broken piece in my "reserve", I never had to use it in our game, but it does detract from the game. Next version should have the air-based miniatures with a more flexible stand.

Provided that someone else had the outsized table(s) and set the damned thing up, I'd be prepared to play again.  The differences between the races are quite nicely done and the plastic bits are really nice, if fragile.  Artwork is OK, though some of the icons are poor.  We found ourselves checking and re-checking the rules rather too much.  It boils down to a standard galactic conquest game with a touch of resource management that takes a very long time.

I like the theme, the way planets are laid out and how orders are placed on the planets. This looks quite innovative to me. But the combat system is far from sophisticated and leaves no room for response. In other words it is Risk style.

I will maintain my attitude of suspicion on games with loads of plastic and all kind of thingies that have to be laid out.

RATING: 6
Awesome looking area control wargame. Great production values. Game-wise I think something is off. I like the hidden orders mechanism but the card driven combat system seems unneccesary fiddle. The same is true for the resource gathering part. You have to move your worker tokens to the various sites to gather resources every turn. Really?? And dont let me start about 'upgrading' your units. All in all the game drags quite a bit while it only lasts 5-6 turns. How did they managed that? I am disappointed because I expected an action packed multiplayer wargame.

I really enjoy this game. The theme makes it for me (because I love Starcraft) but it's also a very good strategy game with a lot of depth.

The up-side to that is I have yet to ask a question about the game that I haven't eventually found the answer to within.

Absolutely fires on all cylinders for me. I think it's tough but intuitive. The rulebook is excellent; players aren't left rifling through poorly laid out instructions every few minutes after the initial explanation. 

For me, it scratches the same itch as Runewars or TI3 and here the StarCraft theme is executed insanely well. I like how the game rewards aggression and dissuades turtling. You have to go after points right from the get go. The components are fantastic.

I'd play this one any time. Mechanically, it's just balls to the wall awesome.

Simplemente perfecto :]

Me encanta, no lo he jugado demaciado pero, me gusto mucho la forma del juego muy tactico, :P, y las partidas jamas son iguales porque el punto bueno fue el hecho de dejar el arbol tecnologico tal como el del juego de pc lo cual hace que no puedas construir todas las unidades de las distintas razas (cuando quieras) y tengas que decidir hacia que tipo de unidades inclinarte o idear tacticas combinatorias. Lo que quisiera es que se pudiera jugar como en la pc por batallas.

Me encanta recordar viejos momentos de niñez con este juego, mi juego numero 1 de pc por siempre.

Gracias FFG por inmortalizar este clasico!
Esperando el STARCRAFT 2

En lo que llevo jugandolo puede ser muy tedioso para las personas que no conocen el juego de pc o.o

Otra cosa que es muy lento y largo y habeces no alcanzas a terminarlo en ese dia.

Creo que el juego podria mejorar en cuanto a la ambientacion si hubiera mas escenarios muchas misiones,
tratate de diseñar algunas de acuerdo a las misiones de pc y tratar de incluir a todos los heroes y mercenarios de SC

Tiene mucho potencial el juego y tal vez no lo supo manejar FFG :(

I absolutely hate the very unintuitive way you decide on your actions, and they happen in order. Detracts from what should be a fast-paced, build crap and have your giant army collide with the other side game.

Unfortunately, the game was spoiled by our hour long group rules reading preceding the actual game play.

However, once we got passed that, and started the game, it wasn't too bad.  I made the mistake of growing too big too fast, and thus, became the target (5 player game).  I was smashed back to nothingness, and couldn't do anything.

I wasn't a big fan of the combat system.  It probably works out well, but for the most part, as the Terrans, I couldn't beat ANYONE in combat.  I didn't have enough Marine models to support my guys, not enough resources to build anything that could take on my opponents... nothing really.  I was sorely overmatched the entire game in combat.  

It's very possible I just sucked at that part, but it really felt like all battles were just hopeless for me.  I dunno.

RATING: 7
I wish I knew more about Starcraft to really enjoy the theme. The card battle system is really well implemented and a lot simpler than the rule book makes it out to be. Lots of action in a short playing time. The team play option is a nice change of pace for these types of game. However I don't think that there is enough politicing for my liking (which is a draw card for me in these type of games), I'd rather play Twilight Imperium over this but this is far shorter and does scratch a similar itch.

This game is growing on me with each play. TI3 is getting less fun. The game is just far slicker and doesn't take the hours that TI does.

I've come to to the conclusion that I hate the thought of actually starting to play this game but once I start I enjoy it. It fast, fun, fierce, frantic, and Sci-Fi (Okay that's not and F but go with it)

Love the plastic and the technology trees.  If you've played the computer game you'll have a greater appreciation for the board game.  Assymetric sides.  

My rating is because of the sudden death victory conditions.  If every game comes down to them, something is wrong with the victory contisions.  These seem a little too powerful.  Hopefully the expansion fixes this.  Both times that I've played I've built, avoided conflict and won in sudden death.

The down side is that it is very unlike other games and so it takes time to wrap your head around.

The biggest problem with this game is that there are so many components. The games takes a long time to set up and pack away. The amount of different cards is my biggest concern, and keeping track of what pile is what. There's also a lot of rules (43 pages) but once you know them the game is very straight forward. Many are likely to find this game too complex to play. I find it very enjoyable to play and I never feel exhausted after playing it. There are many interesting mechanics and loads strategic decisions.

I only have one two-player play finished so far.  I'm reserving judgment.  It seems to have potential, but so far it feels pretty inelegant.

Specifically, I'm not thrilled with the random combat cards.  Actually, the rules for combat in general are too complicated, what with assists, cloaking, splash damage, and whatnot.  I don't feel that it is a very true representation of the video game, nor is it a solid stand-alone game.

Edit: I wish that I hadn't traded this.  I would like to try it again, now that I am a more seasoned gamer.

Estupendo juego que sin embargo me deja una sensación amarga. Lo más novedoso es la colocación de acciones. Facil de explicar y dificil de aceptar en la cabeza y más de plasmar en el tablera. Por otro lado la creación de tecnologias me resulta farragosa. El combate no me gusta como está planteado aunque reconozco que esta dos últimas cosas (combate y tecnologías) están bien hechas... solo que a mí no me convencen.
Amén de que la temática no es la que debiera ya que en vez de participar en escaramuzas como en el videojuego, en realidad está hecho a otra escala más grande, de conquistas planetarias... 
A su favor: componentes, temática, posibilidad de sentar a 6 a la mesa y sobre todo que desde el primero o segundo turno YA puede haber toñas... de hecho el juego favorece las toñas, (sobre todo al atacante) cosa que es dificil de encontrar en estos juegos de conquista ya que la mayoría se prestan al acantonamiento...

I imagined I would'nt like it, but there are some serious strategic elements that form the basic core of the game that make it a very good experience.

The "reverse stacking" mechanics of the orders is just wonderful, and while the combat is a bit complicated for what it is, it works well enough for this kind of game.

Also, being a fan of the PC game, I found it great that the mythos are so well depicted here, and the units actually behave similarly to how they do in the original game.

On the downside, it's a quite long game, and it also has some serious downtime here and then.

A játékban egyébként bolygókat kell meghódítani, rajtuk termelni, épületeket fejleszteni, egységeket gyártani, és egymást ütni. Vagy úgy ér véget a játék, hogy bizonyos számú kártya elfogy, vagy valaki elfoglal bizonyos számú területet.

Elég sok mechanizmus korábbi játékokból köszön vissza (Trónok harca, Catan, stb.), de van azért néhány eredeti ötlet is benne. Tetszik a 3. dimenzió megoldása, én csak teleportnak hívom. Az eseménykártyák jók, a fejlesztéskártyák kevésbé. A kocka pótlására kitalált csatakártyák révén a csatákban kisebb a szerencse szerepe, ha valakinek elég sok csata kártyája van.

Nem rossz játék, kéne még játszani vele, hogy jobban meg tudjam ítélni. 
A 2 órás szabálymagyarázat kissé riasztó lehet:) De a szabály nem nehéz annyira, mint amennyi ideig tart elmondani.

100% accurate capture of the computer game strategy and feel!kudos to corey for that.Now,reason it does not get above a 9,is that it felt a bit tight in the gameplay,and I am not sure about the replayability either.Exactly like the computer game :)
For its price,I would choose another FF game of the same format,except if one is a fan of the computer game.Perfect capture.Not a bad game at all.

Part of the reason I like it is precisely *because* it has ridiculous amounts of pieces.  But all the fiddliness does mean it takes longer to play than the entertainment value you get out of it.  So, I'm kind of torn: I think it's a *good* game, but I have to be in a particular mindset to play it.

Played once with 3 players.  We decided to have the three different races represented.  I was the Overmind with the Zerg armies.  

In order to play well, you really need to know the tech decks and combat bonuses for the various types of units.  As for gameplay, It felt like a blending of Nexus Ops and Risk: 2210 AD.  Although Starcraft definitely requires more study time, I'm not sure if it really adds more "decision making."  The order tokens' phase was perhaps my favorite decision making in the game... but I felt that the placing of order tokens in A Game of Thrones was more exciting (also done by the same designer.)  I do like that each faction has unique units, tech cards and victory conditions.  The same cannot be said of Nexus Ops.  I also really like the absence of dice.

RATING: N/A
I was looking to get into wargames of some kind, preferably without the collectible miniature aspect. Being a pretty huge StarCraft fan, when I found out that this existed AND that it's supposed to be awesome I went straight to eBay. Got it for 80 bucks.

RATING: 7
Most people seem to compare this with Twilight Imperium but I think this really is a mixup of a lot of mechanics aready seen in other games, especially 'A Game of Thrones' and 'Warcraft the Boardgame'. The components are massive and a real plus.
On the other hand I didn't like the card combat rules, the big advantages of the attacker over the defender (really, it's always obvious which cards you have to play as a defender and most of the time you are simply dead meat) and the fiddly micromanagement steps you have to do. The rules are complex (but not complicated) and solid. They managed to restrict the playing time to 3-4 hours (without rules explanation) which is a good thing for such a big game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A space conquest game involving several races and factions fighting for domination with some alternative victory conditions. It concentrates on ground combat, not having ships to fight for control of solar systems or trade. In this way it lacks some of the Sci-fi realism of Twilight Imperium, which is a more detailed approach of the same gene. However it does play faster and is equally as attractive. Quality is as expected from FFG. Would like to play more.

RATING: 8
Its a Fantasy Flight coffin box. Brilliant, but the card combat system can seem cumbersome to some. 6 players, great flavor. Not as epic as some may hope. Minatures are large and amazing. Varied Races. Modular board. Im a huge fan. Buy a bigger table for this.

[i]Posted: 4/2/13, Rated: 9[/i]

Originally released in 1998 (!!!), [i][thing=70722][/thing][/i] has arguably become one of the most recognizable, and the most successful video games ever.  It was the perfect blend of sci-fi geekdom: [i]Aliens[/i], [i]Predator[/i], and [i]Starship Troopers[/i] all rolled into one cohesive experience.  Nine years later, a board game version of this classic was released.  This development is not surprising: there was the [thing=7479]mildly disappointing board game adaptation[/thing] of [i][thing=68458]Warcraft III[/thing][/i], and [thing=17223]the surprisingly good adaptation[/thing] of [i][thing=69309][/thing][/i].  How would Fantasy Flight fare this time around?

A disclaimer before I continue: I heart all things Blizzard.  My friends and I played the hell out of [i][thing=70722][/thing][/i].  If you calculate "enjoyment" of a game by dividing its purchase price by the number of times you play it, then the per-play cost of [i][thing=70722][/thing][/i] can be measured in pennies.  Maybe even in fractions of a penny.  And I purchased multiple copies of the game.  I tell you all of this to let you know that I wanted to like this board game.

The packaging alone is epic.  It is the classic [family=9983]Fantasy Flight tombstone size[/family].  These boxes have to be seen to be believed.  They portend endless amounts of chits and figurines, with playing times to match.  One minor nitpick that I have with these games is that there is so much material inside of the box, that it is nearly impossible to keep everything inside without discarding the insert.  Don't worry, dear reader: my OCD was and is equal to this task, but it takes time to carefully repack the box after each play.

You should be careful with this game, anyway.  [i]StarCraft: The Board Game[/i] ([i]SCTBG[/i]) comes with exquisitely molded figurines for each of the three races in the video game: Terrans, Protoss, and Zerg.  Flying units are mounted on clear plastic bases.  These acrylic bases can snap at the joint where the unit figurine is mounted.  A couple of my units were broken in this fashion when I first unboxed them.  Fantasy Flight sent replacements, but care needs to be taken when returning them to the box.

The map in [i]SCTBG[/i] works well.  Planets are placed on the board and then connected via linking routes.  Players will only be able to move (attack) along these routes.  [i]SCTBG[/i] takes an interesting diversion from the video game with the inclusion of "Z-routes:" in an attempt to model three-dimensional space, there are links which allow planets on opposite sides of the map to be connected by a single link.  In other words, players should try to imagine this map folding on top of itself to establish these extra routes.  I like this addition, as it makes it more difficult for a player to "turtle" in the corner of a map.  Not that turtling is a desired tactic in this game...

For the real goal is to secure and retain control points.  To do this usually requires you to attack other planets, and then to defend your gains.  You will also have to harvest Crystals and Vespene Gas.  It is possible through force mining to deplete the available resources on a planet, so you will need more.  Attacking and expanding require the use of Command Counters, which are the heart of this game.

In an attempt to model a Real Time Strategy game, [i]SCTBG[/i] provides each player with Command Counters: chits which allow the player to perform standard tasks like attacking, moving, research, etc.  In turn order, players place one of their command counters on the map, either on a planet they control, or on a planet connected to one they control (connected by one of those links).  Once all of these command counters have been placed, they are resolved in turn order provided a counter of the current player is visible.  This means that the sequence of these counters is vitally important to executing your plans.  If you want to attack and then occupy a planet, then you must place the "occupy" counter first.  Some time later, you will place the "attack" token on the same planet.  When those counters are evaluated from the top down, then "attack" will be handled first, and "occupy" second.

This mechanic takes a few attempts to appreciate.  Once you have grasped its significance, it is divine.  You can try to interrupt other players' plans by placing your own tokens to impede their progress.  You can place a token as a diversion.  You can mobilize your troops and summon overwhelming forces.  These nuances do a great job of replicating the tension found in the video game when making decisions surrounded by the fog of war.

Beyond this core mechanic, [i]SCTBG[/i] has all of the high production value chrome that you would expect from Fantasy Flight.  Every faction has its own deck of cards, which are used for upgrades and higher-level units.  There is definitely a "tech tree" represented by the building upgrades which are tracked on player sheets.  Battles feel epic with front line and supporting units.  All of these items will feel nostalgically welcome to players of the video game.

[i]StarCraft: The Board Game[/i] does an excellent job of capturing the core decision making and resource management of its progenitor.  The game feels epic in scale.  As a bonus, it doesn't take as long to play as other members in the series of Fantasy Flight tombstone boxes -- if you don't count the amount of time spent packing all of these components back in the box.

Looks Awesome but probably would not make it out much like T13.  Hope I get the opportunity to play it.PS- Finally had the opportunity to play it, I loved, and hated it.  Like TI...too loong for my tastes.  Pros: bits, space set up with Z access, really can open up board, technology cards not as deep as TI, points given after each turn.   Cons: Don't like the battle system with the cards and health and power and support, etc.  also dont like having to cross reference the bonus cards and special abilities in each combat card.  Too much going on in that area for me.  , back-up etc. As it was my first time the movement planning was a little confussing with resource management, workers, and planning your moves in reverse as you placed your chits. It's a toss up if I'd play again.

good game; the combat system via cards minimises the luck factor.

Very long-winded explaination. Lots of rules for a simple system. I'm sure it probably could have been written better. The game itself is extremely good, very tense, with lots of choices to be made. The action stacks are a nice touch as well, forcing all players to think ahead to plan out linked parts of their turn. I'm a little underwhelmed by the combat system though.

Surprisingly fluent and quick play for a game with 40+ pages of rules. Everything is well worked out and tested properly. Made for a very close game on our first attempt. Great replayability due to the different races and the numerous roads to victory. Solid game. Only downside is that it is not really suitable for playing with more then 4 as the downtime and playing time increase well above the average tolerance.

After a few plays this just seems too fiddly and long to get to the table regularly. Going on the trade pile.

After one two-player game, I thought it had some good things going on (theme, combat system, streamlined in many areas), but I can also see where some of the criticism is correct (combat could become an overly complicated form of dice and the six-player game is probably way too long and drawn out, not to mention the Attika-effect of all players having to police each other to prevent surprise special victory conditions from being enacted).

If everyone is familiar with the rules, knows their given race, and are not afraid to mix it up, the game is a lot of fun and picks up a point or two. Get the A/P crowd involved and the game just drags. If you are looking for an easier/bloodier alternative to Twilight Imperium, this could be your game. If you are a Nexus Ops fan and are looking for "more", give this one a shot. The usual FFG top-notch production.

This is a great game.  I quite like it, when there are four or more players.  Is it's an entirely adversarial game, players are encouraged to battle to prevent others from winning.  At times this means that in three-player games king making becomes a problem, which our group likes to avoid.  These teamups can change as the game progresses, but this is not a playstyle we tend to enjoy.  With more than three players, I feel this game really comes into it's own and moves from 'ok' to 'good'.  I'm not terribly fond of the 'special victory conditions', and the intricacies of combat take some practice and thought to understand well, but it's a game well worth playing in a group of 4+.  

I've bumped my score on this game.  Most excellent strategy game, great interaction!  The kingmaking is not as pronounced as I'd first feared, and the multiple paths to victory can still give a player being teamed-up on an opportunity to win the game.  Excellent design!

The fiddliness of the game is irksome.  Lots of set up time and teardown time, and the gameplay is not the most intuitive.  I'm not giving up on it, but it might take some time to hit the table again.  Rating dropped to 7.

I've not played starcraft the computer game, so maybe a huge chunk of theme, flavour and fun has gone right over my head with this one. Initial layout seems critical, I like the asymmetric nature of the races, the terrans seem much easier to play. Game is too fiddly and has too much downtime for me - maybe this would drop with familarity, the game I played the skirmishes seem to take ages. While playing it I just kept thinking, I'd rather be playing Nexus Ops, either that or playing it on a computer ... glad I played before buying a copy.

** Update, now traded for a copy, so might play it again and rating might change (I hope so!)

*** Update played it, and my inital feelings haven't changed that much, this game hasn't clicked with me at all - I suspect not knowing the computer game doesn't help. Now traded ...

Pleasant game with a lot of eye candy. The battle system is a nice compromise with luck that doesn't include that much of it. It doesn't hurt to be fond of the computer game either. Some parts can be frustrating. The order system is clever and has character but blocked orders can have an extreme effect that changes everything and can set you back for an entire turn. Starcraft is to an extent not a forgiving in that sense because it doesn't necessarily let players wait and raise an army since the planets have limited space. But I like it and I'm curious to try to it with teamplay.

Se lo regalaron a Javi en Julio de 2009 por su cumpleaños, pero no lo ha probado aún. Se lo pedí yo hallá por septiembre y cuando conocí a Marc, que sí lo había jugado, tuve ocasión de echar una partida (sencilla) con él. Es un juego de evolución y construcción de tecnologías y tal. No recuerdo los detalles, pero sí que puedo afirmar que el juego está  bastante bien. Tiene una interesante mecánica de pila de acciones que puede dar lugar a más de una sopresa.
En cuanto a materiales.. un diez. Tiene unas cuatrocientas miniaturas preciosas.

Only played an introduction game and it was fun but a bit daunting as there are a lot that you need to have knowledge about to really grasp the game.
I think that it needs several games to get up to full appreciation of the game.

Somewhat disappointed since I love the old PC game. Doesn't quite capture the epic feel a combat game should strive for, I guess due to the Euro elements and cramped "board-universe".

I have a history with starcraft and played quite a bit of it on PC when it came out. The board game is a terrific adaptation of the computer game. It runs a little on the long side for me, but the battles are engaging and the gameplay is fun. I really like that orders are resolved in reverse order as it makes you have to adjust the way you think for the game.

Admittedly nice materials (miniatures etc.) with a lot of chrome ans true to the theme. However, 
more than an hour of rules explanation and the perceived imbalance of starting positions (I started on a 2 point planet and had another one in the vicinity) ruined the game for me. 
It seems too hard to keep track of everyones upgrades (modules, buildings, technologies) across the board and is simply too overwhelming.
Also, I found it much too long.

But possibly a good choice for SC fans.

Another FFG bomb.  Lets start with the 48 page rulebook and the rules weren't even that clear.  So 90 minutes to setup and teach and we were still consulting the rules all game long.  Sculpts are awesome looking but some were broken during shipment.  I was looking forward to playing this with the Starcraft them, tech trees, event cards, etc and it all unravels in a big clunky mess that takes far too long.  We finally got some conflicts and combat in turn 3 and even the fights were anti-climatic.  So fiddly, so overly complex, was it playtested all at by anyone not involved directly with FFG?  Another gripe is the action cards.  The mobility icon looks like a birds-eye view of a bunch of BUILDings.  The build icon looks like a car or train on rails (implying movement).  I know that at least 3 of 4 players made mistakes with their burns because the little action hex thingies were confusing.  Too long, too fiddly, too much downtime, very little excitement; I doubt I will ever play this one again.

Like many say, Nexus Ops is a similar game but plays much more quickly and is much more fun.

Excelente juego de civilizaciones-ciencia ficción, cierta diplomacia y confrontración, pero con un toque táctico muy interesante, que permite cierto faroleo.

Las razas y miniaturas atraen a los que les gusta la ciencia ficción, pero disuade a los que no, lo que lo hace dificil de jugar con no jugones.

 Es un juego que me apetece mucho jugar, sobre todo con 4-5 jugadores más.
Quizá puede tener en contra que puede ser eliminatorio.

This is a very good simulation of the computer game.  I found myself experiencing the same issues as the original game, such as getting out-teched and getting mushed by superior units, and getting a lead and getting crushed.

Three players seemed to suffer a bit from 2 players fighting and the third getting the advantage because of that, but perhaps that's just inexperience.

Once again, a beautiful Fantasy Flight big box game that totally falls flat for me.  To be fair, I'm usually not a fan of conquest type games, but I really thought the tech trees, event cards, etc would make this one fun.  However, the large amount of downtime really killed it for me, as the game really starts to drag once people start fighting.  Fights are cumbersome, slow, and very anti-climactic; I'm not a fan of the way battles are handled in this one.  Overall, just way too long and fiddly for what the game offers, although I'm sure Starcraft fans will appreciate that the game has apparently stayed fairly true to the computer game.

I found there are things i like about this game, and i would try it again, but there are quite a few that i wasn't too pleased with.  Just as in Forbidden Stars the action resolution system irritates me.  You can get hosed based on the turn order that players have.  I saw one peculliar  instance where a player didn't even have to expand much to make their points due to a good setup and a particular leadership card they played .  For my time i would rather play Twilight Imperium 3.

I originally rated this game way lower like a 4, however it turns out we were playing some rules wrong. We played since then and the game is actually pretty good. It's not as engaging as Twilight Imperium. It's a game that is sort of between Nexus Ops and TI3. The only downside I think is the playtime it takes us like 4 hours and this game would be much better at 2 hours.

I only played this game once so I don't feel I can give a totally fair rating and write a clever comment on gameplay and strategy... I did enjoy the game; played it with 5 and it was probably one of my first and serious semi-ameritrash games. I liked it, but I must admit that my heart belongs to eurogames! There was a bit of planning and building up your race's power/techs, which reminded me of eurogames, but you also needed to build units and conquering territories etc. as in ameritrash games. I was really not fond of how the actual combat system works with the cards! However, it was a decent game which I'd like to play again, and a 6 isn't a bad rating after all!

Nice components (plastic figures and board pieces) though the stands for flying units seem particularly weak and liable to break. The illustrations of the units are difficult to tell apart and the rules were a bit fiddly. Clever mechanic for setting up the board and  placing and revealing orders.

This game has a lot going for it, being one of the few fantasy flight big-box games I enjoy (I also enjoy WoW).  The combat is neat but not as creative as WoW though how the technology tree interacts with the combat is fantastic.  When you research a new tech you shuffle new cards into your battle deck - its simple and really effective.  The game is much shorter than you think it is going to be (roughly 5 turns, with the first whole turn just branching out) and there is a lot of combat.  The way the board is constructed makes you have to get into each others business by turn 2 and attacking is so much better than defending that the game becomes more about just kicking each other in the shins the best you can.

I've accepted the fact that I'm predominately a "Eurogamer." However, every once in a while you just want to Blow. Stuff. Up.

Starcraft was my "riskiest" purchase. It's fairly expensive, it's chock full of components, it's a "coffin box" Fantasy Flight game... things that are not typically Euro. But, I was intrigued by its "hybrid" mechanics described in various reviews, and I was looking for a lengthier game, so I took the plunge.

After one play, I feel pretty good with this purchase. It took a good 45 minutes to setup and provide a rules overview, and 3 more hours to play it. But myself and three other friends felt that this deserves another play. I was afraid that this would be too clunky, too burdened by excess rules, but for our first play, the time invested returned a surprising amount of fun. We all expect it to flow much more smoothly with familiarity.

This is an aggressive game. A number of rules encourage offense, and there's no hiding from others. However, the game offers some intriguing choices in the range of units and the balance between "teching up" and keeping a strong presence. The stacking of orders is very clever and mentally challening. I was a bit concerned that each player's "combat deck" would feel too random or forced, but it actually worked very well. Plus, every battle is divided into separate "skirmishes," and this approach emphasizes the different abilities of different units. Combat feels meaningful and strategic.

The components and miniatures are impressive. The rulebook, while incredibly detailed, is also very clear and very well organized. Kudos to the rules writers for clarity and consistent terminology. 

We're just scratching the surface with this game. I'm not sure if this will stay a "9" rating, but right now, I'm eagerly awaiting the next chance to play.

Update: 2nd play, and I'm dropping this to an 8, with hopes that it rises again. I got my arse handed to me. Wow, this is a brutal game. Early blunders can really cost you the game. Given the complexity of all the rules, it's hard to play this game infrequently--it demands to be played with enough regularity to keep the basic rules in your head so that you can focus on the strategy. The good news is that my fellow gamer friends are willing to put in the effort, so hopefully this hits the table soon. I think there's a really good game in here... it just simply demands attention and TLC.

Update: third play... OK, now THAT'S more like it! Played a great game with four players that ended after reaching the the tail end of the "game clock" event deck. I really want to play this again soon. The tech tree and diversity of units, the combat decks, the anti-turtling aspects of the game... this just offers a lot of fun and justifies the longer playing time.

Update. Traded this away after playing forbidden stars a handful of times. There is enough overlap that I didn't need to win both, and forbidden stars is more likely to hit the table.

It is unfortunate that starcraft suffers in comparison to Twilight Imperium. To my mind this is a clunkier and less developed substitute without the same since of growth and development.

This design could improve with modesty.  One of the most inelegant games from FFG already corpulent corpus.  I've played several games and each time I want to like the game, but come out disappointed.  When the game really works, it feels like Nexus Ops with a more complicated set of unit interrelations and resource management.  However the result is not worth the price in playtime or complexity.  It could be reworked in half, nay, a fourth of the rules and as many components.  Sometimes bigger is not better.

However without the expension there is a few things I dislike,like air defence. That mostly got covered by brood war expension though.

I hope FFG will re-edit the game without the licence, like they did with Rex. More people needs to discover this game.

Simple in the core, heavy on the chrome.  The planning phase is brilliant.  All the Starcraft chrome is perfect.
Its a great port - not trying to be an exact conversion but an inspired companion.  
Unfortunately a big negative is that it ends too quickly.  Players easily get their special victories ending the game once the first stage 3 card is drawn.  Very anti-climactic.  And we don't get to play with the cool stage 3 cards.  I know, I know - bash the leader.  Maybe with experience I can both play preventively and go for the win.

I like this best of the big box FFG games I've played. TI3 is just too open-ended and doesn't have satisfying win conditions. Descent is kind of out of control with expansions and dice rolling.

Here, you have a perfect amount of planning, variable set-up, finite game length and reasonable win conditions. The combat system is much more enjoyable than throwing a pile of dice into a box top, as it allows you to customize your battle deck through tech advances...but still leaving in some luck of the draw and some bluff in your chosen cards. 

Plus, I mean...DUDE its Starcraft!

After a couple of plays I am impressed but not blown away. I like the pace, i like the orders system, but the combat hasn't 100% sold me yet. My rating may go up, i doubt it will go down.

after another play, I really dislike the speed at which the endgame hits, and I'm still not thrilled with the combat. I like the order placement a lot, and the tech/building options, but I think I am going to have to start tweaking some things to continue enjoying this game.

I imagine playing with more players would be a very different experience and it's one that I'm looking forward to. For me the placing of orders in different areas with the last in being the first out is one of the most interesting mechanisms in the game. And the multiple avenues for victory including unique victory conditions for the different factions keeps you on your toes and I'm sure in large games ensures a lot of bargaining happens. The production is quite good as per usual for FFG.

I should be the target audience of this. I play board games, I played Starcraft. But I'm learning that I tend to not like these behemoth games, and this is continuing that trend. Too much stuff just makes it not fun for me. I found the action declaration/resolution clever, but it doesn't realy make sense. Say first what you're going to do last, and you can't change it? Um, ok. But basically just too much of everything. I think this could have been something interesting if trimmed down to a more normal level. But I'm also willing to accept that these huge games are great for some people, just not me. Oh, I think the way for me to try again would be using 2v2, which seems like the much more enjoyable way to go.

Initial impressions after two fumbling learning sessions and two actual GAMES (all 2-player)... I think I'm going to like this one. A lot. Visually beautiful, interesting gameplay, lots of choices, a good amount of depth. The various factions are well-defined and well-designed, with key differences built in via individual mechanics, abilities, special victory conditions, etc. The biggest drawback was a less-than-optimal rulebook layout (probably exacerbated by my utter unfamiliarity with the video game... or ANY video game, for that matter). Initially I found myself frantically flipping pages whenever I came across a new or undefined term or phrase (often NOT listed in the index). I finally just sat down and read the rules from cover to cover, like a novel, jotting down questions as I went and assuming they'd be answered eventually (they usually were). I then repeated the process. Twice. I'll likely do it again before the next game, too. A little study seems a small price to pay for what promises to be a very rewarding gaming experience in the long run... AND it has generated a huge amount of interest among many friends who have NEVER expressed any interest in participating in "game night" before.

RATING: 3.75
The combat is a bit too limited in this game. The board space is limited and you will probably not have the potential for serious conflict with more than one or two players. This is a serious drawback in a combat based game that favors attacking.

RATING: 8
My rating of the game is in no way indicative of the goodness of the game.  I would probably rate this an 8.  I enjoyed the game and the people I played it, but I have no desire to play it again.  So it is a 6 on my scale.  I can't give a good reason.  The game is long and it can be a bit much to learn the rules, but in the end it looks like a solid game for what it is.

update 7-26-08
Changed this to an 8.  The second play went much better.  Still not enough attacking by the players, but the game seems to work a lot better.

A great sci-fi game. I love StarCraft in PC, but please don't really compare it to the boardgame version. It has different feeling and mechanism, it's a brave move from FFG and I think it's a good move. Rather than try to be exact like the PC game as possible, they made a good playable space wargame. There is development and research, battle of armies, and area controlling. And the components are pretty.

When you get familiar with the faction's ability and mechanics, this become quite cool subgame of cunning play. The only downside is all of them are geared towards military (It's Starcraft after all).

Another FFG coffin-box game that delivers on the promise.  Just opening the box and looking through the bits, the cards, the reference sheets, etc. is impressive enough.  But the gameplay is highly strategic and requires some careful planning.  Each faction plays differently, so there is plenty to explore in this mammoth box.  I got this plus the Brood War expansions for $50 at my local FLGS, and count my lucky stars that I found it!

RATING: 6
There is a lot to like about this game, but I keep feeling disappointed by it when we play. I think the root of problem for me is the sheer complexity of the game. There is too much to remember, and I keep forgetting things. It also feels too influenced by luck, and that it ends just as your faction is getting into it's stride, but that might just be because we aren't playing it well enough.

I'm not the greatest fan of this type of game, but this seems a reasonable experience. Minus points for the tons of unnecessary plastic. Cardboard counters as used for workers and transports with the unit names on them for would lead to a less cluttered and, to me, satisfying gaming experience. It might help conserve the oil reserves as well.

Looks great at first glance, but the more I play it, the less I like it. Set-up takes forever. Then just when the game seems to really get rolling, you hit Phase III and somebody wins based on their faction's instant-win criteria. Its way too an abrupt ending to the game.

RATING: 9
StarCraft feels heavy but plays relatively quick, probably because it cuts to the chase and gets players into the action almost from the get-go.  The learning curve is a little steep, but the rules are intuitive and once you have these down, you're in for some glorious carnage.  While there are a wealth of options available to expand your armies, there just isn't enough time to flesh them out fully, so the challenge is working out just how much you need to develop your forces to eke out a win.

Sadly, age has not been kind to my enjoyment of StarCraft: tbg.
Still a really good game, but it doesn't know how to end.

StarCraft is an extensive space combat game. This is my "early" rating, given after playing only once (with the Brood War expansion). I think there was a lot of promise, but some things left me a bit cold. I'll update this once I get a few more plays under my belt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I feel like the parts are greater than the whole.  There are a lot of really cool concepts in Starcraft but ultimately I think the whole game feels very stale.  By the end I don't feel like I've accomplished much and the face of the map hasn't really changed.

Maybe that'll be remedied with more plays, though, so I'm not writing it off quite yet.

Nexus Ops on steroids with a dash of Twilight Imperium 3.  I would rather play TI3 (conceptually) because of the things that TI3 has, like politics and the tech 'tree', but in practice Starcraft is just a better game to play.  Should never be played with more than four, unless everyone agrees to not complain about how long it'll take...

12/24/07: I just got this for Christmas! Can't wait to get this on the table! Will rate upon first play.

OK, with two plays under my belt, I feel this is a solid "8" for me. I'd actually rate it higher, but I was Protoss-Tassadar both games, and I feel the Protoss are a difficult race to play, so that weighs in my mind a bit (having said that, I did not show poorly in either game, but didn't win either). This should get a good number of plays because it is pretty straight forward. One minor note of caution - despite what the "normal" play time for this game is supposed to be, expect it to be significantly longer for your first play. Both of my first two games (a four player and a five player) took SIX hours to complete. I expect that to come down, but I can't see a four or five player game going much under three hours in any circumstance.

RATING: 8.5
Most strategy games I have played tend to favor the defender, but this game turns the roles around, making it a game filled with action. Next to the 3 different races, there are many different styles of play, giving this a very high replay value.

The downside of the game is that it takes me about 1 hour to explain to new players. Once you've played it, though, the rules are clear. It also takes some time to play and the game map can get very large. There is also a very large set of components that you need to find a way to store as unfortunately the default box doesn't provide a proper way to store them. Unfortunately in my case, two of the (flying) miniatures arrived broken in the box.

In the end though, this game is excellent!

we've had 2 2p games go about a half hour tops, but our 4  player games have gone 4  hours. Hmm.  Aldaris is very overpowered.  We aren't going to use it again.  Other than that, I'm liking it.  You have to keep an eye on all the players to keep one from running away with the game.  Sometimes the games are shorter than the setup time justifies though (esp w/ 2p)

This never hits the table.  I've only had one play through (which I enjoyed).  The rulebook is daunting, and could have been streamlined.  Usually I dispense with intro-level variants, but this game could badly use one.

Update: I had a chance to play this again last year.  I still think it's a good game, but now Eclipse has a deathgrip on this niche.

RATING: 8
Captures the theme of Starcraft fairly well. The stacking order system is original as far as I know. Very tactical, but doesn't feel like an RTS game; it's an entirely novel experience with a good bit of Starcraft flavor. Rated a 9 only for the fact that I can never get it to the table and setup/takedown time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Relatively fun Ameritrash, and fairly faithful to the computer games. It's essentially a pure warfare version of [i]Twilight Imperium III[/i], using a somewhat annoying ordered action placement mechanic instead of any sort of "role" mechanism, and removes the political element. The upshot is a game that still has quite a bit going on, but is shorter than TI3 by about a quarter. So, if you're looking for "TI3 light", this may be the game for you.

If you're unfamiliar with the computer game, however, I think you're going to have a much harder time enjoying this game. This is in part because of the difficulty distinguishing the units (the plastic bits fail here) and in part because it's going to be difficult to remember which units can do air combat, land combat, or both.

RATING: 4
 I finally got to try this game. 5 players, and it was the first time for all of us. Is the hype really worth it?  Yes, and no. It's not a bad game - in fact, I think it's very good - but there are some problems.  
 
The GOOD:  Lots of very cool pieces.  Well made boards. Lots of action choices for each turn, which maximizes re-playability.  For those familiar with the PC game, the game mechanics are well designed, and make sense.
  
The BAD:  With so many options per turn, AP can set in very quickly, especially for the less-experienced gamer.  Without some prior experience with the PC game, the decision trees are just overwhelming.  The playing time should be listed in days, not hours.  (It took 3 hours to get through three turns, and we were nowhere near done)  The down time when you're not involved in the action gets very tedious.  The rulebook could be laid out better, and some things were left out, or not explained in enough detail.
  
The VERDICT: A not-so-well designed game, that really can't be played in a regular evening gaming session.  One must be prepared to devote the better part of a day to play, and I, for the most part, just don't have the time. I'd play it again, but I'll never buy it.  Definitely not a game for rookie gamers.  I give it a '4', simply because it's so difficult to play.  It probably deserves an 8, except that I'll never suggest it.

Great game that plays much faster than you'd think considering most other FFG games. There's tension, there's angst, there's violence, there's planning and there's diplomacy. What more can you ask for in a game?

RATING: 8
After the colossal failure that was the WoW game, I was dreading seeing how badly they would mess up Starcraft.  But man is this good.  It isn't a literal translation, but it captures the spirit of the RTS in a way that WoW perfectly whiffed.

The order token mechanic is how you need to keep several plans going in your head at the same time.  Resource management is, of course, resource management.  The method of using workers as you pay allows resource raids.  While the map looks like planets, it is really just an RTS island map (although without navy).  The attacker picking the matchups perfectly matches how you can scout the other guy and then give perfect attack commands while he just sees your guys coming and can pretty much just area guard.  The card fighting system is a bit of a stretch, but you could think of it as different player skill in using each unit.  But while the hand management system can't be fanwanked, it is just awesome so it can be forgiven.

Only one game and a ton more to explore.... players play a race of humans, bugs or ... something else.  You begin on connected planets and must colonise, exploit colony resources to build stuff (units, buildings, technology) that will allow you to stomp your neighbours.  Very tight on board situation means you're throwing down in combat very quickly.  Combat is a nice system of skirmishes, where every skirmish is a card play.  Sounds clunky but worked well.  I liked this game - it felt well developed and tight, with a well written rulebook.  Minis and planets look fantastic, the chits and cards are busy and functional if you know where to look.  Good game, quite quick once you've played once or twice.  Rating could easily climb - unlikely to drop.

Falls somewhere between Nexus Ops (great) and Twilight Imperium 3 (not so good).   For two or three players, it's a good choice, incorporating so much of the computer game buildings and units.   The overall feel of gathering resources and building up units and technology is well done.   The coolest innovation is the tech decks which add cards into your main combat deck.   It's like a little mini CCG within the game.   Combat is very much like Magic The Gathering, and the area control of resources feels like TI3.   But offense is encouraged so the game moves along nicely.  It's a decent implementation and an engaging game for a couple hours.

RATING: 9
This is a game I'm just not sure what to do with. The design is quite good and it isn't one that I imagine will ever get a reprint. I want to play the the game and I want to get good and proficient at the game. The downside is that it is a bit more mechanic-centric than play-centric. Which means it is pretty opaque to get into. Which means it takes repeated plays and dedication to really learn and get the most out of. I'd love the be there but I don't know if I ever well. One thing that I've been lacking for some time is a dedicated game group, a group that can really learn a game. So this continues to sit.

RATING: 8
As a fan of Starcraft (the computer game), the chrome adds a lot to the game. But otherwise, it can really get in the way and feel unnecessary. 

Other than the chrome, the game basically boils down to the token placement mechanisms, which is quite clever and euro-like, and makes for some very tough and tense decisions. 

The bare skeleton part of the game is great, but unless you are a Starcraft fan the chrome may very well not be worth the trouble. But if you are a fan of Starcraft, the chrome really gives the game an authentic Starcraft feel.

A true Fantasy Flight big box game, but one that remains reasonable. Long play, but not so bad you really want to quit before the game ends. Doesn't have the complexity or fiddliness of Twilight Imperium (3rd. Ed.) Though there are still 40 pages of rules, they are much easier to comprehend and remember during play because they just make more sense to begin with. 

This game does a great job of recreating the feel of the computer game. Capture planets to gain more resources to create more and better units with which to go kick somebody's ass. I've read that the rules for this game promote conflict and don't reward turtling as much as some other games, but that was not my experience. The player that won our game was the one that turtled the most and had the most secure location.

Had a great time, though. Will play again.

I enjoyed the one experience so far with it.  However, not mind blowing.  It is fiddily, it has player elimination, the presentation was a bit crowded.  I think I'll enjoy the game more when a homemade player aid is out with all the game info and stats presented in a cleaner format.  As others have said, it's kind of an amped up Nexus Ops.  Where the Nexus Ops theme leaves the game wanting with it's weird premise and components, Starcraft doles out tons of satisfing detail, but it feels like it should have been stripped down a little more, or at least make the components less busy.  It definitely feels more fun than Twilight Imperium 3 which is just a bit too sprawling for it's own good.  I know I'm being a bit critical, but I guess Blizzard nailed the sweet spot with Starcraft (computer version) and so you'd hope that the boardgame could finally nail the cool-bits-epic-game-with-lots-of-action-that-avoids-the-zero-sum-banality-of-older-designs-whilst-also-playable-in-three-hours-or-less.

The primary word that comes to mind when I think of this game is: fiddly.  I think the game has interesting mechanisms, especially the order phase, but there are other issues than the fiddliness.  I typically like card driven combat like in AGoT and LotR: Confrontation, but I just didn't like the variable card values.  I think if I wanted to play a space combat game, I would rather play Twilight Imperium 3 despite that Starcraft is shorter and I think has a better range of players for a satisfying experience.  I think I'll echo someone elses sentiment: If I want to play Starcraft, I'll just play the PC game.

A much better effort than TI3. Pacing is a lot faster, game length is more manageable with the "game clock" and no incentive to turtle. 

The thing is though, it's still a long game with short periods of excitement punctuated by long periods of boredom. Worse with six players - I would definitely recommend playing with fewer players. 

And for what should be a straight-up, fun, "blow 'em up" Ameritrash game ... my goodness! The rules! 48 pages of rules. That's even longer than The Burning Blue. Fiddly is the operative word.

Only negative, as we know by nearly all FFG games, are the rules. Written for ... (we don't really know) but a 30 page FFG game rule you could write down to a clear 10 page helpful rule book... 

But the games is always fun and if you didn't have the time for a full Twilight you could take just two hours SC. And if you know Twilight, you'll easy play SC, a lot of things you'll find common.

I love long, combat heavy, non-wargames games, such as Twilight Imperium (Third Edition). So naturally I was interested in StarCraft: The Board Game, especially because it was unattainable One of my friends owns it, though, and we finally found a time to play it. I liked it. I like the combat system more than in TI3 but overall the game felt worse. We played for 7 hours (so longer than most of our TI3 games) and it deffinitely felt longer with longer downtime between turns and nothing to do meanwhile.

My interest towards this game has had its ups and downs, ranging between 6 and 8.5. For a Euro-AT hybrid, this is relatively unforgiving (badly placed order can take you pretty much out of the game). As a direct conflict game, it depends much on the players -- as I play this more, I suspect the rating will even out.

I've never played the game without the Brood war expansion, so I cannot rate the base game.
I was skeptical about it at first, but it got better play after play.
Now I love it and I had to buy it while I could.
I'm a big fan of Vanilla Starcraft and I think nobody could have done a better work of adapting the video game to a board game. Well, I think I like the Board game even more than the video game.
Furthermore, it is surprisingly balanced(despite the asymmetry between factions) and streamlined, .
I think if you are a fan of the Starcraft series and like board games it is a must have.

RATING: 5
Too long, Too many combat mechanics for little pay-off, way too much downtime for very little excitement at all; our group may never play this again. We all asked the same question - Why wast 4 hours  on this rather than TI3, I wanted something sort of like TI3 but starcraft - this isnt it, in fact I dont know what this game trys to be. The Combat system feels way out of place and it breaks the whole game my group agreed without the clunky combat system there might be a game here that can be enjoyed.The Stacked Orders, the Resource/Worker Management, and Nice miniatures otherwise save this game from a lower rating.

I am impressed with how beautifully made this game is, and the components are a joy to play with. 

Three of us played the game and I think my very low rating for this game is because I don't think the game plays well with three--I think it is probably a very different game with 4+.  I sat back and watched the other two players duke it out while I quietly built up my forces till I was unbeatable.  I grabbed my special victory objections in the first phase and just held on to them.  I didn't attack & didn't deplete my forces.  No one dared attack me till game end which was boring, but certainly the avenue to winning.  That couldn't have happened with 4.

Was taught this game early in 2012.  It's pretty amazing.

The experience with that teaching game was enough to allow the rules to sink-in a little easier next time I read them.

The game really encourages people to be aggressive early on.

Was taught this game at a Con and really enjoyed it.  We played with 2 other gamers who also seemed to enjoy it and were very interested in the theme.

RATING: 9
** All plays of mine are using the Brood War expansion. However, this comment is strictly for the base game. 

So far it's one of my favorite games. Lots of fighting, lots of awesome minis and lots more strategy than I thought there would be.
The boys at work ate this game alive. Honestly it was all they could talk about for 3 days, and we played almost one full game a day. No problems at all! 

Pros:

- Miniatures: are awesome and lend themselves to modding some Starcraft "mini" games. Also, while they are made of a sort of "rubbery" plastic, I like this because they don't feel brittle. They also have a good amount of detail. While not perfect and amazing, they are pretty and really bring the theme to bare. 

- Order Tokens: are awesome, and lend half the strategy to the game. You can mess yourself up badly if your not careful, but you can do the same to others as well. Bluffing and thinking ahead will reward players a lot.

- Card based combat: Not nearly as luck based as I thought. While it is ultimately luck of the draw, there was only 2 battles I remember that I lost due to lack of good cards. There is a lot you can do here to ensure you have the right cards for the fight.

- Technology Cards: Really make the game feel like the PC game, but without making it the same experience. You have a lot of play on units, and some units are better vs others, and weak vs others. You have to balance your forces much like the PC game, and those who utilize their technology well, will have a huge advantage.

- Deck Building: was a bonus treat! I didn't realize that you built up your combat deck with technology until I read through the rules. Most tech you buy, you have to shuffle it into your combat deck. Meaning, your deck gets bigger, but may make good cards harder to come by. I found this was an awesome way to keep the game balanced.

- Multiple Victory paths: were also a little unexpected. While the capture-and-hold system and event cards were pretty interesting ways to end the game, the special victories that each race can have is awesome, and really makes the game interesting 

Cons:

-Initial learning curve: is a bit steep, not because the game it's self is complex (it's actually pretty simple), it's all the little bits and intricacies of the game is a little overwhelming to teach. Minerals, workers, 3 different decks in your play area, plus Event and Leadership decks as well. some 12 different units per race, race powers, order tokens, resource cards, unit limits, combat explanation, Conquest Points, transports, depletion tokens, and so on... It is harder to teach the game than to learn it. Well worth the effort though.

-Set up time: is long. After about 10-12 times of playing the game, all the players who've played before can help set the game up, which takes set-up time from about 45 minutes, to about 20 minutes. Still a bit more set up time than many would like, but it's well worth it.

- Planet connectors: are annoying. They stay gripped nicely through out the game and work great. When I take the game down though, I feel like I'm going to rip the printing off the planet when I undo the connection piece. While I don't know how else they would have done this, it feels a bit fragile and will eventually make some really big wear marks. 

Overall rating: 9

For what it offers, it takes too long to play in my gaming group. Otherwise a good game but lost its initial 'spark'. Deep strategy you won't find here as the different technologies, upgrade paths and attack deck would have you to believe. There's only one real way to play it.

Based upon two incomplete plays (3-player and a 6-player) - I expect the rating to increase. (Increased)

Incredible components and a nice blending of techniques. Sequential placing of orders then executing only the available exposed orders in turn requires advance planning and permits bluffing and screwing your opponents (even if at a less than optimal placment). Knife fights in various phone booths breakout throughout the universe!!! Attacking is favored and you don't want to turtle or you could end up as turtle soup.

RATING: 5
Rating based on a single play in suboptimal conditions, so take it with a grain of salt. This game reaches new heights as of components quality. I've never seen such great miniatures. Also, the box is packed with card, counters, and great board elements. This constrasts with the game itself. The gameplay does nothing to bring back the frenzy strategic feeling of the computer game. It has an "order system" similar to the one in "A Game of Thrones" to which was added a clever "stacking" twist that may create strange and interesting situations. Still, it's a little puzzly and can slow the game down quite a bit. Sometime it will also create the opportunity for blocking moves that have nothing to with the theme but are a side effect of the mechanics which leave a sour taste. However, it's nothing compared to the combats. This is the painful part. The combats simply break the game flow and increases downtime tenfolds. Still, even with these flaws, this would qualify as an OK Fantasy Flight title. What really kills Starcraft is its repetitiveness. You build units, expand your base, draw cards, attack, again, and again, and again. The strategical aspects are there, but they are buried under this heap of repetitiveness.

Probably the worst game with a high production value that I've ever played. Feels like the design time got dumped with the license and had to come up with something they didn't even have time to playtest. If this game didn't have the Starcraft theme no one would play it. Bad!

An excellent brain burning game and my favorite game at the moment. After playing this game, I will never find a war game with dice combat fun. 
Favorite elements:
1. Card combat: excellent and almost luck free, ie. you you might win if you play your cards from the deck instead of from your hand (which will rarely happen) and will rarely loose if you manage your hand of cards well and plan appropriately 
2. The building: This is the only board game thea I know that lets you build building in order to unlock every unit aside from the starting one. 
3. The orders. An excellent mechanic that drives the game forward.
4. Components

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
played with 6 people and it had to much downtime. Seems a bit bad balanced (victory conditions...)
Perhaps better with less players!?

played it again with 2. Didn't change the rating.
On paper the game has very much I like about games.
- assymetric player powers: Not only that each faction has a special ability and a special victory condition but you also have the 3 races which play quite differently
- Deck building: I very much like the way you build up your combat deck and how it influences your combat abilities.
- Interesting combat: Its not only roll X dice and count the 6es (nothng against this but it doesn't give you any decisions). The combat System in Starcraft gives you many decisions and adds some kind of hand management.
- preplanned hidden orders: I like the way you have to plan your move ahead especially with the stacks which allow you to react to opponents plans and kind of block them.

BUT: After each game I had the feeling the game lasted to long for what it offers. When I want to summarize what happend in a game I can describe it in a few sentences but each sentence conects to 1h of gameplay. Perhaps some of the problem is that I never played with only experienced players. But I never had the feeling that we played very slowly.

An innovative take on the AT style of games.  The design could have easily been a standard "dudes on a map chucking dice", but this works so much better.  The production is fantastic.  The game looks amazing when it is all set up in play.  The orders system works really well and provides a lot of tactical flexibility and tension.  The card combat works better than dice and allows for some deck building elements.  Best of all, it plays fairly quickly for this style of game.  Maybe a bit too quickly as it is sometimes difficult to get the big units built in time for the end.  I'm not a huge fan of the license (I can't tell a Protoss from a Cylon), but I like this game a lot.

It is the game that always come to my mind when I think about great out of print games.

Even though I like the videogame quite a bit, I thought the BG were "Yet Another Derivative Miniatures Selling American Board Game". Some months ago, I had the opportunity to play it (expansion included) with some friends. I was so, SO wrong!

THIS GAME IS A BLAST! The card battle mechanic is so innovative! So integrated with the technology deck building! The action selection mechanism is unique!

I've never seen such implementation of videogame in a boardgame that worked that great, even better than the computer version!! I have never had such experience with a board game.

Too bad is so rare and expensive. If you know somebody that have it, you must try at least once. It lasts a few hours, but it doesn't feel like this. You'll not regret, guaranteed.

I really like the mechanism of placing orders (mostly in reverse order) and being able to cover other peoples orders to mess them up.  The special victory conditions are interesting and give each person a different objective.

What I don't like is the very lopsided benefit to attacking, the attacker gets to pick pretty much everything and gets more cards.  Almost never will a defender win a fight even if the two forces are relatively balanced.  There is also a huge benefit to familiarity with the pieces and thier abilities which no newbie will have.

So you probably will not like your first few games but (which is unfortunate when a game can take 6 hours) but it does have lots of potential.

After 1 play with 3 players. This game is pretty great so far. It's huge, their are tons of miniatures, and you pretty much need tackle boxes or something to hold everything.
The rules were simple after a turn, and our game only took about 2 hours with punching out tokens, set-up, and rules explanation. The strategy seems varied and exciting. My only complaint right now is that some units border on being useless or far too weak compared to their racial counterparts.

 The Starcraft Cosmos is one of my favorite settings for a wargame. 
The way the battle board with the planets is created in each game is brilliant. 
Even though it takes a vast amount of time to complete a single session, it's still wonderful to see the evolution and progress of each race and faction. (Each race with it's own "tech tree", merits and flaws).
Beautiful card driven battle system, fortunately not that luck dependent.

A very innovative system, interesting gameplay.  Card system was nice, I liked the way tech got shuffled into the combat card system.

What I didn't like about it was the lack of any sort of ownership or stickyness to the front lines.  The situation on planets and between planets is totally fluid.  I like positional play in conflict games where I have a real feeling of place and importance to areas.  Places that are worth defending.

Wish I had played this more.  I don't feel it's fair to rate it.

I think this captures the spirit of the PC game quite well! It even manages to make it turn-based..with a pseudo real-time mechanic. The components are amazing. It is a very tight game at times. Quicker than Twilight Imperium. Plays 2-6. It's 90% conquest though. You must enjoy attacking other players.

The order tile laying mechanic is unique...and if other players can guess what you are going to do on their planet you can get screwed pretty easily. You literally stack your orders..and then they are carried out in reverse order. (Top to bottom.) So, imagine order A is to move to/invade a planet. The other player can put an order on top of your order A and that order would be carried out first. He could effectively send more defensive units there making your invade order less effective.

The card combat is a nice feature as well. It makes you decide whether to hold your higher value cards for more important battles or play them for nearly guaranteed victories.

This is a great strategy war game that is quite the beast of a game. Once you play a round I think it falls into place. I really enjoy the difference in play styles, the deck management, the combat, and the balance between building an economy and expanding. Mechanics place an extra incentive on playing aggressively which makes for a lot of interaction between players and keeps the game fun. Little to no down time keeps the game engaging even when it is not your turn.

Recommended for starcraft-fans, not recommended for non starcraft-fans.  It's a zero-sum game, so it's basicly crush your opponent or being crushed.  It's a bit lacking in long-term strategy, but the game makes up for it with clever and fun tactics.
I also miss a "build-up" feeling (that Twilight Imperium does give me): you start the game with troops already fighting, and the game ends in the middle of the fight.  There is a good side to this: It's a fighting game from the start to the finish.
I feel this plays best with two players.

May 2008 - Finally played it.  It felt similar to TI3 in many ways.  Very Heavy, complicated, impossible to keep track of everyones objectives/upgrades.  With that said, combat was more frequent.  Took a bit over 3hrs for a 4 player game.  I'll start at 7/10.  It was good, but not sure how much we'll play it due to the weight and AP it causes.

The ultimate in sci-fi combat strategy games.  It has some issues, but they are fixed in the expansion pack, which easily boosts this rating to a 10 if you can get a hold of it.  There are no dice.  Everything you do is about preparing/building up your units in the best way possible, reading your opponents, and striking with the best units/cards for each situation, while hoping to be prepared for the inevitable counters.  No cheap tricks, only the best player can win.  Only main downside to this game is how some combat cards are unbalanced, a problem fixed in the expansion.

Awfully broken, a game that lasts that long a time should not have player elimination. Also the combat is too deterministic even though the cards try to fool you otherwise.

Add counter intuitive rules to the mix and this game just hasn't got anything to stand on except for great components and an idea that could have gone better.

It's likely that I won't play this ever again.

This was a grail game for me, and I'm so glad to have it in my collection. Harkens back to a time not so long ago when FFG jam-packed their coffin-boxes with goodness. With rising production costs, we will never see games like this again.

RATING: 8
A very good implementation of the computer game, StarCraft:TBG is a massive game with beautiful components.  Card-based combat system rewards planning and has very little randomness.  Tons of units and special abilities make for plenty of variety in strategy.  

Unfortunately, non-StarCraft fans might be turned off by the length (around 3 hours), complexity and numerous tiny icons (some of which are hard to differentiate).

[Mar 09] [Rating: 9]
The action starts from the first turn and there is constantly a waves of attacks from the different players. I was kind of surprised in a positive manner that the game is as aggressive as it is. If you know the computer game, you will have an idea how the units will work together, but for me it was a little overwhelming at first. With repeated plays it gets easier, but if you are prone to AP, you maybe should avoid this game as there are many units and many factors to consider.

It feels though that the end comes too quickly as you really don’t have time to really develop the higher tier units in the game, if you’re not very focused. Besides, the end game comes so sudden and the last turn on the game you are trying to reach the secret objective (which is the most common end trigger). I think this game becomes even better with the expansion.

I think it plays good with any number of players, even if I prefer to play it with 4 or 5 players. With fewer players you don’t have breathing room at all as there is a much smaller galaxy (it scales though). With 6 players the game takes longer time to finish.

Wow, this is a really amazing game .

simple to learn.

once you explain what options you have and the orders, after the first game round most ppl will have a good grip on how the game works ,and can begin playing with confidence.

This is Still one of my top games but i dropped it to a 9 ,if it could make it to the table more than it would be a 10 again.

RATING: N/A
One play with three and one with five. I think the game has a lot of good core mechanisms, particularly the order token mechanism. The level of detail that is laid on top of those core mechanisms is significant, however. Playing the game is not hard at all; getting the rules right in all the marginal situations requires rather a bit more work; playing the game [i]well[/i] would require dedication, I think. How well do you know your units, your combat deck, your tech deck...and those of your oponents?

No doubt there are lots of people for whom this sort of thing has a lot of appeal, people who want to be immersed in a particular game and to be able to pit their knowledge of its arcana against that of their opponents. I'm somewhat less enthusiastic about it, though; I prefer games where the complexity and interest comes from the nature of the rules, not the number of them.

Another epic Sci-Fil offering from FFG which is unavoidable to be compared with Twilight Imperium (III). It plays quicker and has less bookkeeping resulting also in less A/P. So yes, I prefer it (at least with the expansion Brood war). I like the order stack but also "fear" a little the fact, that you don't know exactly how strong your units will be (as this depends on combat cards which must be suitable to your unit).
Rating after only one game including Brood War expansion.

Extremely faithful to the source material, very competent translation into a fully-fledged boardgame. Components are beautiful. Order mechanics are great, as is the combat - I can't help but feel that dice would have added some flavour, though. Perhaps dice plus tech cards could've been a good alternative? Still, after 3 plays, each game has been varied and tense. I particularly like the different tech trees, and that it's not possible to build everything - choices are important. Special victory conditions perhaps seem a bit too easy, but that could be due to my local group still being inexperienced and not actively watching out for them at all times - 'watching your neighbour' seems to be a good motto. I need to play more, but so far, I think it's a great game.

Excellent game!  Lots of ways to balance the setup, forces, and play-styles of different players.  Great rules, which take a complex game, but break it down in sequence so only one or two need to have read the rules.

Lowered my rating after the smoother and quicker Forbidden Stars came out, which is very comparable but I like the theme even more and the gameplay is generally better.

A great game but not perfect. Downtime can be a problem especially with new players or those that can't remember rules. I didn't like a couple of the special abilities, like the one that ends up with the player having their whole combat deck available to them. I don't think that should be able to happen. But on the whole I thought the theme, pieces mechanics and everything were excellent. A really fun game.

RATING: 6
I believe there is a good game in there, and while the rules are quite complex, they are manageable and intuitive for the most part. What really complicates things is all the interactions between the many different cards and units. It is all very thematic, but if you are unfamiliar with the computer game (or haven't played it in many years, like me), that can be quite overwhelming. 

The diceless combat system is nice, but it is a little convolute and does take long as the players evaluate all their options. There are some production design issues, such as the planet areas being too small for the units, bases and all the relevant info. Resource cards cannot be stacked, as essential info is on the top AND bottom of them, and that just adds to the required table space, which would already be huge anyway. 

Also, there is some unnecessary chrome, with the event cards and special orders, which could have been left out completely. With a more streamlined, elegant design, this would be a much better game. As it is, the only things that make me keep it are the theme and fantastic miniatures.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This one is excellent!  Much more thinky than I expected.  Seems to be very well balanced despite the differences in factions.  One thing to note:  I was able to win a game without getting into a single battle.  FWIW, this would not possible in the multi-player video game.  You would have to kill at least one unit (if your opponent was already down to just that one unit already). 
2008-03-07 - gotta ding it one rating point for the potential for elimination.  It two players can gang up on you, and you just don't have the right cards, so that you are wiped off the board in round three, I may be willing to turn down a game. :)  Admittedly, I made some bad decisions...none that I thought were nails in my coffin.

So, the good news: unlike many other FFG games, this one actually ends, and if anything, sooner than it ought to. But don't even think of playing this unless you are well-versed in Starcraft lore--if you're like me, ignorant of PC RTS games (or of Starcraft in particular), you will drown in special powers, exceptions, strange reinforcement abilities, and upgrade goodies. 
Oh, and combat is the worst part of the game. That is not as it should be.

Very visual and attractive game; it play in house my son and I and his friends; for it I bought it. It is complex and it is necessary to think very much the orders that you give and what place you them are doing; and nonetheless it is possible that the things do not go out for you well. It is a game of total war, continuous combats and in that the assault is rewarded. The problem that has is the space so big that occupies if it is played by the players' maximum and also in it delicate of the figures of the game. Good game.

This is a cut-throat fighting game. Leave your base undefended and it's gone... Technology upgrades and units use a clever mechanic, which works very well with the theme. Only Middle-Earth Quest does this "deck-of everything" mechanic better. I also liked the order queue very much.

If I could have convinced my playing group to like this more, I would still have it...

RATING: 7
This is a very good game, and while it looks overwhelming when you pull it out of the box, it really isn't as complicated as it first seems.  The game fills a great niche between Nexus Ops and Twilight Imperium III.

It is a grand space military empire game, with some civ elements and clever resource/action point management mechanics.  My three favorite things about the game:1. Insane production.  The miniatures and chits are incredible.  The cards and the board are beautiful.  The miniatures are well-sculpted and surprisingly easy to identify.  I cannot think of any other game I have ever played where the components and production even come close to this one.  It makes heroscape, heroquest, and descent look like the mayfair version of modern art or Frag by steve jackson.  The components in this game rank up there with "games" where the components are the game - like Warhammer or Hordes.  2.  Super replayability - six races with variable player powers, different victory conditions, modular board, and multiple different strategies to take with each race - exploration, war, high technology defensive strategies, plus multiple different strategies to take with how you develop your military and economy.  Tons of interaction always ups the replayability of a game.3. Tense decisions.  The secret action chit-laying mechanism really makes for some interesting decisions.  Its hard to plan your turn and you really feel like you accomplished something good when a clever plan goes off and you take someone off guard by invading their home planet when it didn't look possible at the beginning of the turn.  

My three biggest complaints:  1.   Initial planet grabbing is totally random.  In a game where 15 or 20 victory points can win you the game, starting with a 2 vp planet vs. a 1 vp planet (which scores each turn)is a huge advantage.    This could be house ruled easily with some sort of worker bidding for better starting planets.  2.   Combat is clunky, predictable and unsatisfying.  The play-a-card-with-your-unit-on-it is too anti-climactic.  Its not hard to rifle through your combat deck a couple of times with research and the three cards you draw for attacking.  Typically, its easy to tell whether you will win or lose a combat before it starts.  For a game where the combat is the meat and potatos you are building towards for most of the game, this crappy system is a real disappointment.  The tech system was done so well with the buildings, modules, and tech decks, yet the combat is totally boring "play your best card" and compare predictable numbers?  

3.  The ending is abrupt, too damn fast and anti-climactic!  Most of the special victory conditions aren't that hard to get, and once you do the rest of the players play beat-down-the-leader.  On top of that, if someone starts out with a 2 VP planet and manages to grab a couple other conquest point planets, they will hit 15 fast.  You have to watch out for this, or they will have the game in the bag quickly.  I wish all the planets were 1 vp/turn to eliminate this.  Maybe with more plays or more players this problem would be gone.  If not it would be easy to house rule.  Lets face it, this game should end with a massive fucking battle where plastic clashes with plastic in interplanetary destruction!  It didn't end that way for us.

I thought this was going to be a game that I just HAD to buy at some point, but I was wrong. That's not to say it's a bad game, it just covers a lot of ground that has already been covered. Despite the massive amounts of units, each figure, be it a ship, alien, or mech, has nothing to set it apart from any other unit. If you have a card that matches it, the bigger units do more damage. If you don't, a little armadillo with spikes does as much damage as an enormous starship. The combat system was on the level of Risk. The real shining point was the little tokens that you place to execute orders. That aspect was well-crafted and added tons of strategy, while at the same time eliminating a lot of downtime. I'd rather play Risk 2210 for grand scale warfare, and I'd almost always take Nexus Ops over this game for superior combat, better victory conditions, and length of time. I would definitely play this again, but there is no way I would buy it considering I already own Nexus Ops and 2210. The $80 just isn't worth it, even for the cool order resolution system. All that said, there's nothing really BAD about it, it just didn't seem all that groundbreaking.

It's both "gee, awesome game" and a personal, emotional bond that ties me to this game. It was my first really-big-box game, and it was one of my first more complex games overall. And I've played it quite a bit some years ago, would love to play it again now, but don't get to it anywhere near as often as I'd like. Definitely a great thematic experience for those who know the video game. Slightly less so for players not familiar with the unit types - I found that it tends to get slightly confusing for those. But personally, I love it.

Played with 2, 3 and 6 players, and each time we did not complete the game (most players decided to stop playing).  There are some interesting mechanics (placing order tokens), the pieces are nice, except that those on stands appear prone to break (there were 3 broken units in the game I played - the game was brand new).  Further, the "universe/planets" is not thematic and gives an advantage to the attacker.  Game appears heavily geared towards combat, yet the combat system is not interesting and too long for what it is.Over all, I was disappointed, and did not object when 3 of the 6 players decided to stop playing.

It's not a bad game.. it's just that i don't enjoy it because of the downtime & the usual leaderbashing..
From the mid-game on the moves get pretty intricate, and if you're playing to win.. you'll need a lot of time thinking about what order to put where & when.. while !everybody! else is waiting.
It reminds me of TI3 a bit.. (just a bit though). The models are gorgeous, as are all the components.
The gameplay & mechanics are solid & balanced.

It has taken several years to get this to the table, and it was a disaster when it arrived. Like TI3, there are many, many rules and bits. There are some new, unique mechanisms, with some borrowed. I'm not sure I like the rock-paper-scissors/A Game of Thrones style combat, as it seems like it is forcing it upon the game. This is StarCraft! Better technologies means better capabilities, more lethality, and more carnage, but it is not that straightforward. Instead, it is a matter of drawing the right cards for the right units. There is a strict limit on number of units on each space, which seems counterintuitive. The "first in, last out" order token mechanism is novel, but again, this seems forced on. In fact, most mechanisms about this game seem forced on, like it is alien and uncomfortable. I expected the streamlined battle carnage excitement of Nexus Ops, just on a bigger scale, just like the computer game--you know, amass resources, amass units, and then send them in for a cataclysmic climax. Instead, it is a cerebral exercise of trying to optimize [b][i]to[/i][/b] the mechanics, and not to the game. You lost me right there. Maybe I'll try this again on another rainy day, but it will be awhile before I revisit this. It is an unstable '7', waiting to drop at the first sign of more frustration.

The "Broad" Game. Unlike other games of the same genre, in Starcraft:tBG you won't spend 4 hours turtling an army and then 30 minutes fighting. Combat starts fast and furious from the very beginning, and I love it.

I like also that this can be easily escalated from 2 players (cutthroat strategical plays) to 6 players (cutthroat diplomatical plays).

This is the best coffin box FFG game. There are so many miniatures and boards, you'll need a big table for all that stuff.

Bought from a friend who didn't like it all that much. As a fan of the RTS computer game I was highly skeptical of this game at first, but it has become one of my favorites. Once you've mastered how to set the game up, it can be played incredibly quickly and is highly enjoyable even with 2 players.

My friends don't seem to like it though, as they all complain that it ends too quickly; ie. just when they get their Carriers and Ultralisks on the board. I can see where they are coming from, but feel that this is simply part of the game that you have to accept.

My impression is that some of the complexity is unnecessary (lots of unit types, each battle is broken into multiple skirmishes, lots of special combat rules, three card decks: combat, technology and events to get used to, technology by both cards and buildings plus other stuff). This leads to a lot of down time even with only 3 players. 

There are a number of interesting mechanics: Order tokens (a bit like Game of Thrones), Technology cards that you buy and then shuffle into your combat deck, Resources you mine by placing Workers on them during the turn and then (if you still control the area) you return them to your available workers area at the end of the turn.

The Starcraft bits are pretty (better than TI3) but most of the icons on the counters, cards and play mats are not obvious and some information is printed in places where it is hard to access when needed. E.g. it is hard to see what column of costs and abilities matches which of your pieces.

As a game for 6 players, it's a DISASTER.

Lasts far too long, takes far too much physical room, there are too many unit types, too many chits, too many card decks, too much administration, not enough fun.

You need two tables to play this monster, incredibly good eyesight as you need to tell whether the inch-high unit 6 feet away is a marine or a firebat, an ability to memorise 20  shapes and the unit stats that go with them.

Combat is far too complex for the level of the game - can you attack land AND air units, are you in an area with a base and do you have air defences, what bonuses do the cards give, what is your effective strength and health, is there a valid supporting card, do you draw a card from your combat deck instead, do you have any technologies that alter the unit strengths, or event cards in effect, is your unit assisting or supporting, where can you retreat to, where do you find the space to set up the skirmishes that make up the battle, when and how does splash damage take effect - even when the unit retreated instead of being destroyed - the list seems to go on and on.  Something akin to the Nexus Ops combat would be more in line with the rest of the game.

The planet resource cards can't be stacked (that's if you want to know which planet they are for as well as their resource values), and you can't fit the bigger units on the board, and you have to cover up the resource values on the board with bases and units - so nobody can tell what they are.The rules are poorly laid out, so you spend large chunks of time trying to find out what rules apply, only to find that every rule has an exception that may only be mentioned on a faction's card - that you don't have - so nobody really knows what's going on until you've slowly run through all the options.  Once you have 3 or 4 technologies/events in play, you'll forget something vital until after the combat where it would have made a difference.  This is a computer game that should have stayed a computer game - there's just too much going on to allow you to enjoy the experience or immerse yourself in the gameplay. 

If you have 6 players and 4  hours, play Twilight Imperium III instead (although it did take 4 versions to get that game playable, so it may take a similar effort to make StarCraft a viable game for 6).

Do not play this game unless you enjoy endlessly moving cardboard and plastic around and mixing up your card decks constantly.

Bday 07 - Just picked up from FLGS (10-31-07).  Can't wait to play!!! Played 2 player looking forward to playing with more players now. Four players is much more fun then 2 players.  You really need to play aggressively right off the bat.

With the Brood War expansion, I consider this the greatest game in my collection. The mechanics and the theme complement each other, the game can play out in a myriad of ways, it's fun on your first play and will reward many more outings.

It's also great for team games! Which is extremely rare.

A game I fell in love at first glance. The components are smashing, the rules are interesting. The scaling is really great: a four or five player game is balanced and strategic, with alliances formed and broken as need arises. A three player game is a Mexican duel with the one who attacks first often beaing the one to die first. A two player game is a knife fight in a phone booth: fast, brutal, unforgiving and deadly.

A beautiful game with an interesting initiative order mechanic.

The combat system is a little unusual - the learning curve will likely last for several games. Part of the problem is the excessive number of different units, which will please computer game purists at the expense of focused gameplay.

Starcraft is a very thematic, but also plays well and even manages to avoid dice. It is a long game, but the outcome is rarely determined before the end as there are different ways to win and the event cards can provide surprises. Order placement and the card-driven combat are among the more interesting mechanisms in the game. The components are attractive, particularly the plastic miniatures. Unfortunately some of the the latter are difficult to identify, as the pictures on the player mats are very small. In terms of gameplay there a couple of drawbacks: that a player in a poor position can have little to do or even be forced to retire from the game, and that, with larger numbers of players, there can be fairly longs waits between turns especially when large battles take place.

one playing, I think it's good.  Don't know how good as I didn't really have a complete grip on it until about 1/3 of the way through, and I was playing the Zerg and totally didn't do the right thing with them.

second playing...its too long, even with 4 players.  Don't like the value for the time investment one bit.

Looking forward to playing again and really getting into it. I think there is a pretty cool game in there, though the planning phase can bog down and the victory conditions are possibly too Euro without any real thought, like the remake of Warrior Knights. That said I think unlike Warrior Knights this really heightens the need for combat, which seemed interesting.

After 1 3-player game.

Not my type of a game, but I appreciate the design..  My biggest personal complaint is the complication and interaction of many many cards and abilities of units and races.  It's not that it's difficult to understand them, but rather it's hard to keep track all of them in the context of possible strategies and general gameplay.  Personally I don't desire to dive deep and study/explore this myriad of possiblities and choices...
Age of Mythology is more trimmed. I prefer AoM's way.

Ah, one more thing - downtime is a real issue here.  That's why I wouldn't want to play Starcraft with 5-6 players.  I think 3-4 is ok.  Plus - with 5-6 players constant checking of approaching special victory conditions for all players would be real pain in the.. bottom.

EDIT: I start to realize that I will not play this ever again.. (completely not my style).  Rank going down.  The only reason it doesn't get [b]2[/b] from me is the fact it is a really good design.

Well, I was hoping for a lot with Starcraft, I guess. Where the game fails is not in broken rules or defective components. It's simply not fun. It's way too serious, there is not a lot of suspense, the decisions (apart from the abstract and agonizingly difficult to play command tokens) are somewhat brainless. It's simply not Starcraft, and I'm not talking about the scale here, there is just none of the excitement, story and feeling of the videogame. Disappointing.

***UPDATE***
I lowered by rating by one, since the last time we wanted to play, we realized that no one even wanted to have a look at the rules again. We played Nexus Ops instead. :D

This game is an easy perfect 10. It's heavy, of course, but worth it. It captures everything I like about the pc game. I think its greatest strength is the excellent combat system. The biggest flaws I've found with similar games like TI3 and Forbidden Stars were the combat: too luck based for TI3, too long/complicated for Forbidden Stars. This falls comfortably in between. Great game. Buy it if you can find it.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (June 2012)

I’m a huge StarCraft fan, so when I played the game I was severely disappointed. It was too long for what it offered and I was bored at the end, too much downtime (the worst sin a game can commit). I will give it another chance soon as I bought the game, but I will probably sell it.

The game has great components and art. The minis are gorgeous and the board looks great. It’s been awhile since I last played the game AND perhaps the person who explained it made a lot of mistakes (thus I will play again soon), however I do remember that I didn’t like that you had so little defensive capability, but I liked the “deckbuilding” mechanic.

Bottom line, I will give the game another chance, however for this time/complexity ratio, I would play Twilight Imperium 3rd edition instead of StarCraft. I will comment and rate again after I play it again, for now I feel this is a 5.0 for me, a boring game that I would play from time to time due to its awesome theme.

Current Rating: 5.0

After another play, I enjoyed more the game, but not by much., All my previous comments for the game still hold. Too long for what it offers, lots of downtime, a bit boring. I will try it again with the expansion to see what it changes.

The combat system is ok, but I really miss throwing dice dice in combat.

In theory I should like the game but in practice I'm bored by it.

I recently played Forbidden Stars, the StarCraft reimplementation. I’m much more of an Euro player so I didn’t care much about it and I don’t care much about Starcraft either. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating. I already sold both games because my desire to play them again is very low, however, I recognize both games can be great for certain kind of players, but they aren’t for me.

Sprawling space exploration and conquest game with a brazillion pieces and cards. I don't have any experience playing the computer game, so everything was new to me. There were a lot of cumbersome mechanisms that took a LONG time to teach. Downtime was pretty significant in a 5P game. For a grand epic space game I'm interested in trying TI3 to see how it compares. Not wild about playing this again anytime soon.

Nexus Ops does everything Starcraft could ever hope to, but better and in a fraction of the time. Take command of an alien race, stake out part of the map to collect resources, build a range of combat units, brawl. You'd be amazed at how much time disappears into the void while Starcraft fumbles this basic formula. It doesn't help that it's based on one of the most enduring and well-loved videogames ever made. Bad in its own right; atrocious when held to the standard set by the source material.

RATING: 7
I like the card mechanic used for fighting.  The board setup is fun and the resource management feels, at least to me, as close as you could get it to the computer game it is based on.  Biggest downside...  time between turns in a large game.  Undecisive players can slow turns of this down to a crawl.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Build up your economy by controlling planets. Use the resources to buy additional units of various types or new factories that can produce better units. Then use your army to attack other players. The attacker has a big advantage so it is difficult to play a purely economic game. It is possible, if the other players attack each other and are then to weak to attack you. It has nice pieces and nice economy building. The military attacks seem challenging because it is difficult to know for sure if you csn win. Special cards help see to this. Also, whoever loses the battle can be greatly weakened. The alien theme helps add to the fun.

RATING: 4
I loved starcraft the video game. So this should be a good bet for me. I am sure there's maybe a not bad board game here. But this game was the one that broke my patience with flabby inelegant kitchen sink FFG design. Ridiculous amounts of cards and tat that haven't even tried to eliminate needless junk by combining effects and card sets. Every single rule or mechanic seems to have come with the premise - oh lets have a deck of cards for that. Rather than combine some of these decks together for a more efficient elegant design, we get a box with a high content count ( which is all that matters right . . . ) and a player area littered with various chits, decks et al.

I got so sick of the look through this deck, change that deck that I just gave up playing it.

I might go back to it. At some point.

The most looked forward to game of the year. Did it meet the expectations? In terms of a board game, the [b]mechanics are solid. A little simpler than I thought[/b]. The biggest problem this game suffers from is the balance of units. For example: the unit tech tree for Terrans highly favors Starport compared to the Factory. Two of the Factory units can only attack ground, and the one that attacks air (Golaith - Tier 2) fights as well as a tier 1 Starport unit (Wraith). [b]While the unit variety works well in the computer game, it takes away from practicality in the board game[/b].

The system of [b]planning orders is quirky[/b] and takes time to get used to, and after players understand the mechanism, the play is somewhat linear. Your forced to attack and build in a predetermined order - otherwise you are set back for a turn. You could mess up someone's order queue, but 1) you need an adjacent base and 2) it will effectively negate the effect of your order - putting you at a disadvantage as well. Turrets are very annoying too, since it's a bit easy to crush a staging ground by attacking. And the retreat rules... take for example: if an assist unit is forced to retreat and makes it's way to an empty enemy base, it destroys the base at the end of the turn, even though it has no actual attack ability. Kinda anti-thematic. 

This game is definitely engaging as the battles go by quickly and attackers have a huge advantage, but it's so easy to effectively counterattack, especially with the protoss's 3 card draw for defense.

Lots of good ideas, but I was hoping for something a bit more of something... More strategy or tactics or unit abilities... [b]something feels missing[/b]. Maybe it's just missing the sound effects or music score.

Still an enjoyable strategy game, though not as complex as a wargame. Overall, I think the [b]mechanics look better on paper than in application[/b]. Too bad.

RATING: 6.5
Based on the PC game of the same name, this boardgame takes a much higher view of the action. Instead of groundbased battle, player use their troops to fight for control of planets. The 3 races are well represented, with a huge library of technology and multiple ways to utilize their effectiveness. The best thing about this game is that it is geared towards attacking and not defense (unless you aim to win by Conquest Points). Fulfilling special victory conditions require players to go out there and take some hits to win the game.

The card-based combat system was NOT as elegant as I had read. Battles between 2 players was slow. Not as bad as MR or Age of Mythology (where the game effectively stops for the other players), but there was definite downtime.

The order system is unique and original, but doesn't really add much to the game, except forcing you to plan backwards (that just added downtime). After a few games, you do get used to working around the clunkiness of the system by holding back your important moves until you have last-player-advantage.

The Crystal/Vespan gas system was great. No need to collect a mountain of tokens. (i.e. Warcraft). Very elegant and well thought out.

Massively underwhelmed by this one unfortunately. While there are some positive aspects like the planning phase and the executing, the details are somewhat problematic with the combat system being the worst. It's so unintuitive and non-sensical that, at the end of the game (which I won for whatever reason) I still hadn't quite grasped how combat worked. It's really hard to estimate how difficult a fight is going to be because you can't be even remotely sure what's going to happen or which card comes out etc.. This may get better with more plays but I'm not sure that they'll ever happen. Shame!

Epic strategic game based on a legendary videogame. Played it only several times only in three player variants. Still eager to try it with more players. One of the great advantages of the game is that there are no dice at all and the only randomness comes from the cards.

An excellent, beautiful game with an elegant combat system. It's fun and really not very complicated. Despite the simple basic rules there's a lot of depth in the units and their possibilities.

Since it's out of print you'd better get it with the expansion while you can.

Finally, after over a year of waiting, this one hit the table.

A 3 player game; fun was had by all!
It blends some nice ideas from A Game of Thrones and adds a bit of standard "attack an are to gain it's resources".  It works well and rewards aggressive play.

I have only played the Protoss and it felt right.  It seemed the other two races had abilities/strengths and weaknesses all befitting the cpu game.

I look forward to playing again and now took it off of my trade list.

Will rate after another play or two.
**************************************************

Update 6/4/09

After another couple of plays, I am ready to say this game is fantastic.  A lot of replay value, a lot of choices in each game.  variable map makes each game a tad different...each opponent's special victory makes each game different.
really, truly well done in balancing the theme/backround with strong mechanics.
This will continue to hit the table for a while...and Brood War/Typhon are coming my way, too!

Great game. Nice components with great theme. Really captures the feel of the computer version, unlike the Warcraft boardgame. The order-mechanic tends to stir the pot quite a bit. And I really like the cardbased combat too, even if it slows the pace a bit during the fights. One of the best sci-fi games I've played. And it doesn't take a day to finish.

RATING: 7
Very cool dudes on a map game wit a theme I simply adore. Major bonus points just for that.
Beyond that it's the classic board game. Gather some friends (or family) and settle down for the evening.

These days I prefer shorter games (with less setup) but yeah. Even as just a collectible I adore this product.

For a 2007 product the minis are really awesome as well. I always thought the recent upsurge meant all older boardgames had shitty minis but nope. Here's SC2 to kick that notion in the face.

RATING: 8
Players start to lose lots of control over their ability to win once you get to 5+ players. In general, players only interact with 2 or 3 other players so a lot of an individual's success is determined by the skill of other players to stop those who you can't. This has a loose kingmaking feel to it and can become very frustrating when you win or lose not because of how well you played but how poorly others played. I would rate this game a 2 or 3 at 5+ players.

At 3-4 players this game is incredible. The intensity of players always being on the verge of winning and needing to be stopped is exhilarating. The constant shifting of power as players band together to stop the newest leader is excellent and has produced some of the most interesting games of anything I have ever played. At 3 or 4 players this would easily get a 10.

At 2 players it is far too easy for one player to pull ahead, at which point they are rewarded for their growth and become harder to stop. It is very risk in it's run away leader syndrome.

The bottom line is the game probably should have been limited to 3-4 player from the beginning.

The board layout basically prevents holding up and prolonging what is already a long game.
Worm holes provide back routes on all sides.  Attackers can bring in more units and draw bonus cards.
Multiple victory routes (duh!) and great production.

Basically a game I can play once a year at BGGCon.  Requires too much table space, lots of fiddly components, and I have no more room for another FFG Big Box.

I played 6 player, and thought it was too much downtime.  Would gladly play again with less players, say 3-4.

Currently my favorite game. It gets better (and deeper) every time I play it. Haven't found anything broken (other than a few battlecruiser stands, haha) after 20+ plays.

It's most fun with a large crowd, but it's a fully legitimate 2-player game as well, with no "neutral armies" (which is one of my beefs with Risk, Domaine, etc.).

It has a steep learning curve, and an even steeper "strategic understanding curve". It took me five or six plays to even develop a sense of how to plan a path to victory. If you invest the time to understand this game, it's a great one.

Addendum: I've played this about once a month for almost three years now, and I'm still not tired of it. If I could keep only one game, this would be it.

Incredibly fiddly: mechanisms are obscure and battles are opaque. You need to have multiple games under your belt solely to begin making truly informed decisions instead of educated guesses. This would've been a plus if not because it's due to obscurity. Has tons of breadth complexity, but I'm not sure of how deep it is. My guess is not too much.

In any case, considering I'm not captivated by the theme, its length and how many great space empire building games are out there, I see no reason to keep playing Starcraft solely to see if there's something other than chrome.

[size=12][b]Why I like StarCraft: The Board Game[/b][/size]
+ StarCraft: The Board Game seems to be the most thematic of all of the RTS board games.
+ I am a huge fan of the theme.
+ I liked most of the mechanics. 
+ There game requires meaningful decisions to win the game.
+ The complexity of the game convinced me to join a board game club and got me into board gaming.

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to StarCraft: The Board Game[/b][/size]
/ The base game seemed flawed in a few regards. I hope to play the Brood War expansion to see if my issues are fixed instead of wasting my time writing them down. 
/ The rulebook is way too long. I suggest looking for a rules summary. 
/ The game set-up takes a long time. We are talking hours without some sort of way to organize the game.  The solution here was to establish a system. 
/ The miniature stands fall off. You need to super glue them together. 
/ There is some errata that requires fixing. 
/ The components list that comes with the rulebook is bad. 

[size=12][b]Why I dislike StarCraft: The Board Game[/b][/size]
- The game is hard to teach.
- The game drags on.
- I was not a fan of the deck-building mechanic in this game
- The game does not work with less than 4 players.
- The game drags on with greater than 4 players. 
- The combat has a few odd rules.
- The Typhoon promotion introduces turtling and I do not recommend buying this promotion.

---------------
Certainly an interesting game. Just played a couple of 3 player games and have enjoyed them (despite getting destroyed both times!), however I have a few concerns (too many cards/units that everyone really needs to know, not much in the way of manoeuvring, the order stack 'mini game' doesn't really interest me, etc...)

Played a 5 player game (with expansion) and that was a pretty decent experience. Dragged on a bit (but we did play slowly) but still... I am looking forward to playing it again and getting a better feel for the action.

Rating hovering between 7 and 8 - additional plays needed. Great components and tense gameplay have not yet revealed a weakness, but something in me senses that something is wrong. A little long and a little hard for downtime, but should improve with player familiarity.

A more recent play with a different play group had much less downtime and faster play. Still a long game, but can be a more fun experience with people with little or no AP.

My buddy bought this for me for my birthday!

I haven't gotten a (real) chance to play it yet -- our first attempt was aborted, pending a more full preparation with the rules.

UPDATE:  SO FREAKING GOOD.  Played it again, and didn't make it all the way through.  There are SO many rules, and it's SO difficult to figure them out (FFG has the worst rulebooks ever).  But once you spend hours puzzling over the mechanisms, there is a cool ebb-and-flow to the game.  NEED to play again soon.

I love StarCraft. It's a great recreation of the PC game, though more on a grand strategic rather than tactical level. It's complicated to teach, but once everyone's got the rules down, it actually plays rather fast. Combat feels a bit off, but once you get used to it, it's not too bad.
Also: eye candy!
EDIT: if there was somehow a way to combine the reseach options in StarCraft with the combat system of Forbidden Stars, I think that'd be the perfect mix!

I loved starcraft on PC, and I enjoy the board game. It really gives a great feel to the RTS that other game types miss. The worker placement, the map crawl while building your base. All the elements are there. 

The card battle system is a fun and unique system to keep things interesting as well. The command counter stacks and timing take a bit to get the hang of, but once you do you'll be ready to conquer.

Strongly recommend the expansion as well.

RATING: 6.5
4+ hours is a really long time to sink into a game.  On top of that, the game is fairly dense with significant setup time and a 48 pages rulebook that put significant overhead whenever a new player learn to play.  The theme, units & mechanics are unpalatably geeky & technical.  If sure helps a lot if your players are into the eponymous video game lore.  There's significant downtime as other players take their turn and the flow is overall chuggy.  You really need the right specific group to make this enjoyable and you need to play semi regularly so that the rules are understood and setup expedited.  Mechanically, it's very solid and captures the theme right while creating real challenge and tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's not so bad and it's surprising how much they integrated the aspect of the video game into the board game. Yes, there is a lot of rules and exceptions. There is also a lot of special abilities but it allows you to create different ways to build up your empire. So it encourage variety and replay value. There is a couple of things that are a bit buggy like the order placement and the battle but they can be easily adjusted.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme matches well with the video game (as I am told) but this is not a boardgame version translated from the video game.  It is it's own sci-fi themed no-dice wargame with some new wrinkles but very detailed.  It is lengthy with more players so it's best to play with three, and four isn't too bad with experienced players.

Rating after single play.

It took us about 3 hours to get through the rules, which is really incredible thinking of what the rules actually are - they could have been written down in a more condensed way with less repetition, in my opinion. The game itself, 3 players, took only 2 hours... All in all, it was fun to play. I especially like the way the orders are handled, being able to obstruct another players order by placing an own order on top of that player's order. But honestly, I would always prefer playing TI3 than StarCraft

Another bloated game from FFG that didn't impress me at all. It has a few really interesting mechanics (movement in a third dimension, etc.) but mostly all I could think about when I was playing this was that I wish I was playing A Game of Thrones instead. Too massive, too complex. I am going to have pass on this one.

Rating is based on one 5-player game.  I enjoyed the game, but found it to run a bit long.  Took us a little over 4 hours.  Of course, a second play with everyone knowing the rules would almost certainly go faster, but it still isn't the first game I would choose if I were to sit down to play something that would take a couple hours.  I just felt like I had worked hard playing the game.  I also think my rating would be higher if I were familiar with the computer game, but I was coming to the game with no background on it at all.  Production quality is fantastic--the minis are awesome and the variable game board is very well-done.  Tons of cool bits to play with.  The game should scale very well since the size of the board (number of planets) is dictated by the number of players.  I don't feel the need to have my own copy of this game, and it probably isn't one I'd ask to play, but I'd still be more than happy to participate in future playings, particularly if everybody already had at least one game under their belts.

RATING: 6

The problem with all out war games is they are so dependent on the personalities of the other players.  Sometimes the worst in people comes out in such stressful do or die war games.  Also you have the issue of two players taking out one player and there is little you can do about it.

Other than the issues of multiplayer war games in general, this game has a lot of strategy involved.  Placing the 4 order tokens on the board is really tricky.  There is a lot of stuff you can build so what to build next is key.

The 'board' is so claustrophobic.  Everyone is pretty much right next door to you.  There is almost no empty space to expand into.  You are often invading by turn two.

No dice involved and not much other luck involved either other than the event cards.

Played only once, I definetly need new gaming buddies, when a game becomes a mock (or people talks with sarcasm about it)in some manners (such as length), you know it isn't gonna be played more. This game, after it's first play gets mocked for being too long (or complex)

[b]Edit:[/b] Definitely another 10. I played it again against one of my friends and the only painful part was to teach him how to play, after that it became somewhat simple. It's one of those games with a lot of options but when you get to know them all, they become evident and simple. You obviously need more players to see the greatness of the game and the lenght of the game will not become a burden with the bast interaction you will have through combat. This game will encourage aggressive behavior and that's a huge plus with my group. 

This quickly becomes a masterpiece after a few turns, where all the systems click together so well and suddenly you forget you're playing an intricate game, and become immerse in the world of Starcraft in a strangely light game where everything flows smoothly...

This game really wow'ed me. The rulebook was a lil bit messy. But once we started playing the gameplay smoothed out nicely. It feels really streamlined but it doesn't deduct from the thematic gameplay. I love how the combat system with technologies replace rolling dice and adding lotsa modifiers. It may or may not be entirely original, it still is f-ing great.

RATING: 7
Lots of things are going on in this game. The game are tough to master at first. The game is long to explain. At first the gameplay felt strange: the game was over after 4 turns (special victory conditions), almost no combat took place and no big units got built.

On the second try, we played more competitvely and the game got much better. I still think it is difficult to get big units on the field: you have to do a lot of research, build, ressouces gathering first but it is a really engaging game. 

I really like the "stack" action mecanism which gives a real dynamism to the "planning phase". The combat with cards is really awesome as its the research "tree" abstracted into a deck.

[Update] I want to like this game. I really do. The bits are superb, the Technology deck + combat system are cool, all the units are really we characterized BUT every game we had has been either bland or boring. The player wait on their CP source, throwing an attack here and there. The game are short and usually won on CP. You don't have enough time to develope your tech tree/buildings or to really use those big units in combat. I think our group plays too conservatively and don't fight enough.

I can't help but think that Nexus Ops bring most of the Starcraft feel while doesn't giving any choices but to fight.

A very smooth and slick game for something so complicated.  The whole time I played it, I kept thinking, "This is what I wanted TI3 to be."  It was nice to play a wargame that relied on aggressive attacks rather than building up strong positions.  A bit tricky to learn, but gameplay went very quickly after just a few turns.

This is a lavish game, and I recommend it.   It does an astonishing job of being faithful to the video-game of the same name, and taking it to a new level, and doing it in board-game format.  It's a colorful game full of pieces, cards, etc.  You sure get your money's worth.
The only thing I quibble with is that I would have replaced the combat-card system with stats for the various units with perhaps cards just for special abilities.

Shipped with broken minis. What a bummer.

Some aspects of this game are fun, but for me, the card-based combat, and having to remove figs from the board and line them up during combat, were a complete drag.  Too many impossible to create specific situations relating to the card powers.

RATING: 3
I lost my first game before I got a second turn.  Second game:  Sat down to fill in for someone and never got to play.  I'm not sure if it's the game or the players, but it seems overly cumbersome for what it is.  Many of the pieces will never see play as far as I can tell.  This seems to be a disappointment, as I love the computer game and multiplayer conflict games in general.  Still need to give this another try, though.

Update:  Ok, tried a third game and it just doesn't get any better.  Two few meaningful options and too little opportunity for maneuver and surprise.  Lots of nice plastic, but too little substance.  I'd rather play two games of Nexus Ops than one of StarCraft.  I don't need to play this again.

Risk, upgraded to the modern concept of table-top gaming.
That's it.
Each player gets a faction with its own special rules. Each faction belongs to one of three races, and each race has its own unique units (so two faction from the same race will have tha same units available).
Units are devised in a manner so that they strongly condition the style of play, which is a good thing.
Rules are overly complex, and sometimes clunky, but overall it's a good game, well worth a try.

Lots of tactical and strategic choices, and lots of conflict. Not an easy game to learn (the rulebook could be better/clearer) and has a fair few fiddly rules; neither is it the easiest game to play (expect player mistakes and serious brain burn, particularly with the order placement mechanism), but gets easier after a few plays. Recommend using a timer to keep the game moving and force players to think think think in 'downtime', since it can become bogged down otherwise.

It feels as it could have greatly benefitted from a severe streamlining. There's just too much stuff to handle for little payoff in gameplay or fun (this is still your average "war with a few different units" game, overcomplicated by ideas like "issue commands in reverse order", "build your tech deck", "resolve combat comparing cards", etc. all of which sound cool or somewhat innovative, but fail to be entertaining or interesting enough to justify their burden).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game that stays pretty true to the computer game.  Takes a bit long for my taste, but it does speed up as players become more familiar with the rules.  I like that it stays primarily combat-based, but also that if you don't invest in research and such, you'll often get overrun in later turns.  And the combat mechanic is great - never truly knowing the value of what your opponent has in their hand (although you can plan pretty effectively if you just assume the worst).  To me, it adds a nice "fog of war" effect that I think more games should have
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[2-6] Another huge game from FFG. Production quality seems good, except that some minis were bended and they seem to break quite easily. The game is rule-heavy, but is quite intuitive after all. What really makes the game interesting is the "reverse play order", meaning that first you have to know what you want to do last in each game round. The game is quite fiddly and requires a large table. High interaction which starts right away and as a nice bonus, the attacker has the edge in combat (usually) which encourages conflicts.

RATING: 4
This one is tough. It's the first heavier board game my friends and I ever tried, and we just had a rough go of it. The worker management is fiddly, and the game always seems to end before anything interesting happens, usually by one of the player's special conditions. Only played it twice.

Might re-rate it if we ever play it again, as after reading the rules again I think we would understand the concepts better after playing so many other board games. Unfortunately the first impression might keep this from coming out ever again.

Having tried this twice now, I just don't like it.  IMO, it's just too 'fiddly.'  The rulebook has to be one of the worst ever written by Fantasy Flight, making you jump all through it and being insanely redundant.  The pieces are great but fragile, and the board; while semi-original, is kind of blah.  Thought I would love this for sure, but I'll take TI3 over it any day.

[b]First impression of the game?[/b]
My impressions are favorable.

[b]What are the highlights?[/b]
Tons of plastic goodness. The order placement system is pretty cool and keeps players engaged. The game does a great job of porting over the system design from the RTS computer game. There is a lot of depth here—a lot to explore. The rules are well-organized and well-written which is a plus with a game this dense.

[b]What are the drawbacks?[/b]
The game is LONG...we didn't make it through an entire game. It took me about an hour to explain the game and we played from 9 p.m. until 2 a.m. In that time, I we played 4 full turns. I think we had probably 2 or 3 more turns to go. I would confirm the comments about confusion regarding the interplay of various units. For example, it's not intuitive, other than brute force, the advantages of a Hydralisk over a Queen.

[b]Who would enjoy this game?[/b]
Hardcore gamers only on this one. Fans of the computer game will definitely enjoy the game and may even have a leg up. This is a full-blown Ameritrash game (without dice).

[b]Who would [i]not[/i] enjoy this game?[/b]
This is not a game you buy for your nephew and try to bang out a session on a Thanksgiving day. It's not light and it's not for casual gamers. But I think that may be obvious...the girth of the box is intimidating enough as it is.

[b]Would you play this game again?[/b]
Yes. It's one of those games, I would love to play again soon...but the reality? It will probably sit on the shelf for another year and I will have to review the rules and the game will take another six hours...*sigh*

finally got to play this one and I liked it. Fills a void in that it is much fast than Ti3 (and not as good on many levels) but good enough to scratch a similar itch. The game play focus is on combat and that seems right for the subject. I have concerns that some of the units will rarely get used, due to the time to develop and the need to defend one's self, but time will tell on that and certainly 1 play is not enough for a fair assessment. Look forward to trying this one out again soon.

After one play, I have still to decide between a 7, 8 or may be even 9.

This is a nice game. It plays somewhat like other light wargames, like Nexus Ops, Risk 2210, Twilight Imperium and even Shogun (Dirk Henn's). This is a good thing, as I like those games, but it is also a bad thing, as they all start to look alike. With this heavy competition, I am not sure whether this particilar game will win the field...

One othe good point about this game is that, dispite the various player powers, all seems the be well-balanced!

After two plays, I rate it 8.

I've only played this so far with 3 player, which supposedly isn't ideal, but it was fantastic. The thematic capturing not just of Starcraft in general, but of various unit effects and other interactions is extremely satisfying. The miniatures are pretty cool, though they are a bit fragile.

Anyone who loves the video game will probably feel the same about this game. If you don't like complex/long games though, you won't like this. In fact, I would highly recommend that all players read the instruction manual (which is very well produced) before the game to save you a lot of time. Especially because understanding the rules helps you comprehend the wealth of choices available to you.

Starcraft is one of my favorite 'long' games.  It's biggest strenght is all the different options and the possible strategies, asymetrical races, beautiful components, and fast and aggressive gameplay.  It's downside is it's lenght (specially with many players) and a steep learning curve thanks to many little rule details that can be easily forgotten, even after repeated play..

I really like the game for 2 players because it's a constant battle over a small territory, and it plays fast.  More experience with 3 players tells me this does not work as well, because if 2 player enter conflict, the third one benefit, and one of the 3 player can be knocked out of the game very quickly.  2 or 4+ are recommended. Zerg vs human or protoss in a 2 player game is also tough to balance due to the zerg ability to hatch more units quicker. In a multiplayer game, a player who is trailing the leaders in points can still bust out a surprise special victory at stage 3, keeping it competitive for everyone.  The rulebook is also really well written with tons of example, pictures, and detailed explanations of each phase, wich is welcome because of all the small details.  It's a good thing because there is a crap load of rules (too many actually).

While this can be a very long game to play, however, the fact that each player resolve one order at a time, means the game stay dynamic and cut the downtime.  I personally don't feel like there is downtime at all with experienced players, everything happens rather quickly.

I used to think Broodwar is a must have, but after a couple of plays,I now believe the base game still is a lot of fun and will provide hours of game play.  BW just add a little more of the same, but the leadership cards are a very nice addition.

Do I recommend this game?  Yes and no.  While I love to play it, I know why some people hate it.  It's just a real chore to learn the rules and require lots of effort. Not knowing the Starcraft universe do not help because a lot of units (specially Protoss) all look the same and it become confusing. Other games in the genre can reach the same goals with less effort.  If you like to fight, you like to push plastic figures and like space theme, however you should check this game.  Like I said, I like it as a 2 player direct conflit, it plays in less than 2 hours.  Maybe I am a masochist, but even if I still scratch my head at some of the rule details after 20 plays, I would play this anytime.

RATING: 10
After 10 plays this game is incredible.  It has all the stuff I like - A theme that fits, a variable setup, too much to learn quickly.  I love playing a game that I have to 'discover' as I go.  For instance, the same race on the same starting planet may have to played totally different since the other planets and races will change.  The components are worth the price of admission - great minis, very durable cards, and big planets that fit everything they need to without being cumbersome.  A minor quibble is the organization of the rulebook is not intuitive (for me) and the index very incomplete (a good start, though!).  I doubt I will tire of this game soon and I know there will be expansions coming to spice it up even more.  This is a 10 in my book.

This is the most addictive boardgame I can recall playing.  Just one more... just one more...  Reminds me of Magic the Gathering without cost too much $$$

And for those FFG haters - the game came with a broken piece that was promptly replaced (so there, nyah!)

My favorite multi-player bash each other game.  I will be playing this in twenty years (if I am around to do so).

I'd really want to play a good deal more to get a real feel for the way strategy really plays out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.06
Added four more plays. Still trying to decide on the rating. The random factor of setup has a solid chance of screwing somebody on some level. I was eliminated early in one game based on setup, and I won another in vast part due to setup as well. If everybody is of equal skill, the setup really might be the deciding factor.

Another example on the randomness of the game. Player A had the needed 15 VP to win the game. We check out Event III cards and mine says my opponents lose 2 VP. I gain a VP via a leaders card and the game goes one final round. I win since I am now in the lead. I won simply because I happened to draw that one card. If someone wants to buy the game, they really have to accept a certain amount of random factor.

One tip to counter some of it would be to house rule picking three planets and keeping two. If a player, let alone a new player, draws two planets that have crap for resources and they are playing the Protoss, well, their basically screwed. Drawing a third planet at least gives them a chance to get one planet with decent resources.

There is a lot of administration going on in the game. I would have copies of all of the steps the game goes through on a player aid for each player to help counter having that info go through one player. This should also make turns go quicker since people now what they need to work on next between their turn.

Played a three player scenario and I liked it a lot since it's a preset game and players are forced into a semi-coop situation. I actually wished there were more scenarios so those would get played versus the randomly generated game.

How planets are placed can literally force one player to go through another player. Gateways can keep tricky to deal with as well. I guess there is enough randomness it somewhat balances out in the end most of the time.

The uniqueness of the races and their balance is done really well. There really is a lot to like in the game even if it goes beyond how much randomness I want in a game.

Three players games I would deem as being my least favorite. Two and 4-6 players work best. If doing 3 players, play the scenario.

Played with expansion. Playing a friend's copy.

Ratings Potential: 7-8.5. I can see house ruling picking three planets and keeping two as bumping the score. I think an 8 is a realistic peak. Another game that is so close to being awesome and yet...

Aspects of this game I like but the biggest downer is that most of the time you just are building your army with little interaction.

The best part of the game takes to long to get to and is over to fast.

Played a few times more. Really nice bits, Combat is a lot more fun than I expected... I just would like the game was a little longer so the bigger units were viable... I still have to bring a Battle Cruise into play as a human.. Or a guardian as a Zerg... The Archon are more viable though..

Added on 2008/10/21 - Had a bad taste of the game during a 5 player game. Last place gets in a postition that can't loose due to special condition. It just felt weird to allow to in the middle of the build order - after building units destroy a base and rebuild in the same are. Affected the game result so much.

Added on 2010/12/29 - The expansion added the ability to take out the special win condition and the high end units comes out pretty much every game. I can't see me playing without it.

Added on 2012/04/25 - Last few plays have been with experienced war-gamers that understand that holding a grudge in this game make the game bad for all players. Definitively an amazing game when you take the special win conditions out of the table, and people accept the changing alliances nature of the game.

- Combat system is paradoxally both too simple (just attach a card) and too complex (flying, not-flying, cloaking...and relatively a lot of units).
- Very clumsy mechanics to build stuff.
- As like Dust...this is tactical game not strategic and it should be opposite.

I really tried to like Starcraft but this just happened to fail at every layer. Finally there is "ameritrash" game with no dice...and then you find yourself thinking..."there should be dice".

This is one of those games for the dedicated fan.  There's a lot of game here.  Lots of strategies, bits, and replayability.  I played with the expansion and it was really long, and there were many moments when a player would go, "I didn't realize these guys couldn't fight those guys; or I forgot that I couldn't do X; or I didn't realize I couldn't do Y, which had a significant impact on game play.  I had the same impression of this that I had with War of the Ring if I and a group of friends had the time and inclination to dedicate this game it would really be cool but generally I avoid these "lifestyle" games.

Thoughts based on just the first game, will change in future. Interesting command system, could-be-nasty setup, loads of different units for each race and tech/combat card boosts make for a steep learning curve to a gamer who hasn't played the PC game at all. Still, pretty nice, aggressive and doesn't reward turtling in the way, say, Twilight Imperium (at least 3rd ed w/o SE) does. Definitely waiting to play more.

I love this game, it is fantastic.  I expect it will be good for a long time and we easily fill up the table.  It is a large time commitment, but that is because of its complexity and depth.  There is a large learning curve and I can imagine strategies changing frequently.  Players come up with cool ideas to modify the game, although these are not always practical.

So I had my first two plays of this game on the same day. I enjoyed it but it was a little odd. I turtled the entire time and it payed off in units but I didn't fight a lick. Next time I'll be more aggressive and maybe compete a little more. 

Update: after my 3rd play I'll leave it at 7.5. It's a good game with a ton of agonizing decisions, but it can take a while to play. It's not boring by any means.

Update: this goes up to a 9 with the expansion, about a 7 without.

I love the tension in this game and the variability you have with building armies. The one game I played with more than two players (5 players) I felt the game had a lot more tension and excitement than in a 2 player game. Besides combat card draws, there is relatively little luck in the game and is not a significant factor. One of my first "Wargames" and am actually quite impressed with the game. I do tend to get stomped in this game, but I still enjoy it a lot.

A very nice looking game.
Perhaps it does all go too fast but take too long. In a 4 hour game you'll have 6 turns (each of which consist of four actions - but still not a lot).

Like most Fantasy Flight games there are problems, they listen to the feedback and release an expansion (eg. Warcraft, Twilight Imperium, Doom, etc.). With Brood War it becomes a better game.

Complex, involving, and ultimately rewarding game that offers a bewildering array of options for strategy. There's a lot to absorb between the different races, units, and techs. In addition, the game flow is not very intuitive.

Stick with it though, and it offers a very flexible game with a great mix of overall strategy and tactical manouvering against your opponents. It also finishes up in a decent amount of time due to the fact that aggression is rewarded and the special win conditions are often possible to achieve.

It's a long game but it has a nice system which includes hand-management and a tech tree.  I like the variable win conditions and that the game encourages combat (advantage to attacker).  It's a war game so don't get too upset when you're attacked on all sides and demolished... just hope it's not during the first half of the game where the climb back will be long and difficult.

RATING: 10
After playing this game twice, one two player and one 4 player, I know this will be one of my all time favorites. The game plays rather well. it does have some slowdown when players are deciding their turns and combat, but the friendly ribbing and trash talk makes it worth it. The combat system is tough. You need to balance your cards and have to be willing to take losses. It is rare that you will go into battle and not lose units. The game components are top notch and only amplifies this rating. The game time to play is shorter than I expected. a 4 player game with tons of rule checking only lasted 3.5 hours. I was expecting at lest 4.5. Take out the rule checks and add rule familiarity, and this game could easily played in under 3 hours with 4 people.

RATING: 7
Less trading and diplomacy than TI:3, more direct focus on building units for combat.  Plusses: tech tree allows for strategic specialization, allowing for future replayability.  3 races * several specializations each goes a long way toward making games different.  Combat card system works pretty well at first blush!

Wow.  Just loved my first game of this.  Yes it was quick, only lasted 2 turns and I won with special victory condition.  But that was because of a mistake by my opponent.  I could have easily been stopped and my whole turn ruined.  I have a feeling the more I play this the more I am going to like it.  Can't wait to try going fast mutas next game.  After 2 more games, both lasting 2 and 3 turns respectively I am seeing what people are saying about this being too fast.  I wonder what would happen if people tech up instead of attacking, they would probably lose.  All have been 2 player though, would like to try it with more.

Like my friend Guille said: "Mucho arroz y poco pollo" ("Lots of rice and not much chicken")
We played for a whole afternoon and we felt a little dissapointed. Attacker has all the advantage. In fact we did not see a single succesful defense. Then, there is a lot of micromanagement, and for what? Everybody ends up with more or less the same level units. 
Then, no matter how well you've played, everybody finds himself in a position to win. And there is still kingmaking due to turn order.
Also, the cards in the combats delayed the whole thing.

So, all in all, I wanted to like this game but it dissapointed me to some extent. I would still give it a try again.

This game is variously reviewed as the best wargame ever, and the best thematic representation of a computer game in board game format - and these sentiments match up to my experience with this game.

I only brought it to table once, in New Haven with my visiting friend Dylan.  We didn't play it entirely correctly, but we both *loved* it - the best part being a toss-up between the fantastic plastic figurines of classic Starcraft units, or the *EXCELLENT* initiative order determination mechanic (you create a stack of tokens, which both screws with people's carefully laid plans; and also tends to reduce the effectiveness of overwhelming forces if memory serves).

In my recent board game auction here on BGG, I toyed with the notion of selling this mostly-untouched OOP game I paid many pretty pennies to get - and then I realized my foolishness.  This shall continue to sit and await the right group of fellow gamers, and when it again comes to table, it shall be glorious.

Rich theme, great strategic choices, nasty combat, well balanced. The learning curve on the rules was steep, and that's really my only complaint.

The more I've played this, the more I am impressed by it... it seems to have an intensity to it as it reaches the climax of the game that few other games have. In my opinion this is due to the PLAY mechanics and not the theme, although the theme is so well integrated into the mechanics that arguably the two cannot be separated.

----------------------

Now that I've played it enough times I can be honest about it's flaws:
1) It's an absolute bitch to teach to new players. Seriously. There is so much going on they they are almost instantly overwhelmed and the best player aids only serve to bog them down and confuse them further.
2) This game defines fiddly. Unnecessary chrome out the nose, and a kajillion little bits and tokens to keep track of the chrome, hyper fragile minis. To a degree this is as much an advantage as a disadvantage, but honestly, when I am playing with teenagers, I am in this constant state of paranoia that some small, very important token is going to be lost in time and space.
3) The game absolutely does not work with six players. It just doesn't. It drags, it takes forever to set up and take down, it gives a heavy advantage to the player who is lucky/skillful enough during planet placement to distance himself from the other five, and you need a table the size of Texas to fit all the bits and pieces on it.

Seems to be more complex than it needs to be, however, once you wade through the Rule Book, it is worth the effort.  The game play is relatively quick and easy.  The two biggest pitfalls are (1) the combat system is awkward at first, but grows on you; and (2) there is a lot of info on the cards, faction sheet, etc. that is not so user-friendly at first, again, with more plays--it grows on you.  Somewhat simplified and improved by Forbidden Stars.

Starcraft is a massive game with piles of components. It takes a very long time to set up, a very long time to play, and a very long time to pack up! It's a shiny game, but I feel it's just not worth it's hefty RRP. If I put this game next to Arkham Horror which cost less in the first place I find myself feeling a bit ripped off (Arkham is far better for gameplay and cheaper too!), which definately doesn't vote well for SCtBG; I suspect this will go to the shelf and stay there in the long run...

After a couple of more plays I just don't like this game. There just seems barely enough time to achieve anything in a game before the times up, that is unless you don't even bother with the tech decks and then you will be beaten to death by the player with the strongest base units instead. Maybe the "play until only one side is standing" style would be better... no, actually that would be the same but another 10 hours of play wouldn't it?

Big, expensive, shiny, long-winded and possibly unplayable.

Gorgeous bits. Evocative setting.  Use of a poular license. Interesting board set-up.  Innovative command mechanics.  But after all that, the play falls a bit flat.  I'd like to play it again, but it failed to move me.

UPDATE (after an entire play):  First third (ha!) of the game flows well, after that it becomes way too long for what it is. Everything is constrained in this game:  unit limits, where you can attack, who you can attack, with what and how many. Nexus Ops does all this with a more fluid, less interfering design.  In a year, will this be played at all?  Oh....right....cue the expansion.

There is a lot I like about this game.  It is eminently replayable: the game "board" changes every game; each race has their own unique strengths and weaknesses and have a variety of units to build; combat moves along at a brisk pace (I didn't experience the downtime that others have critisized); the technology tree and events add even more variety to the game; the orders system, where players alternate placing chits, is a terrific mechanic that creates a lot of tactical options and rewards forward-thinking; and different paths to victory forces players to think strategically.  The components are awesome and the play time (three hours in my experience) is very short for a game of this scope and size.  Once you get a turn under your belt, the game is intuitive and pretty simple.  Update: Downgraded rating - the game can either be epic or end abruptly before anything gets moving.

RATING: 5
This was so close to being good that it breaks my heart. I recently got the WoW board game, and was really impressed by how good it was, so I thought I'd give Starcraft a try. It is indeed a good game, but I can see why it hasn't been reprinted after all this time.

One thing Starcraft does very well is being an epic game of moving dudes around a map and attacking each other. The rules are incredibly simple despite the thick rulebook. In many ways, the structure of the game reminds me of Star Wars: Rebellion. There is a lot of programming actions followed by carrying them out, but this game utilizes a deck-building mechanism for technology and combat cards. The combat is really simple as well, and this may be the first game that utilizes card combat in a way that I enjoy. Also, the way you use your workers it simple, yet effective. The core engine of this game works really well.

Unfortunately, the game does not feel enough like Starcraft to me.

All the units, races, technologies, etc. are here, but ultimately the game doesn't really translate these well into the game. All the units are very similar, with some technologies helping to differentiate them slightly. Despite the designers trying to capture the theme, it felt like the miniatures were put into this game to sell the game rather than to be utilized as important components. For the most part, units are either ground units, air units, or support units. Beyond that, there are very, very minor differences that don't really differentiate these units from each other.

Along with that, territories are won and lost very quickly. I get that this game is trying to zoom out from a single skirmish to a more abstracted, universal view of what is going on, but it doesn't give me the same feel as playing the PC game. You aren't so much building up bases and chipping away at your opponent as you are expanding on a map and attacking opponents occasionally.

I don't know. It's difficult to put into words why this game doesn't translate the feel of the PC game that well, but it just doesn't for me. The WoW board game really gave me the feel of growing and expanding my character, but this game didn't feel like a game of building a base and sending troops at my opponent. As I mentioned before, Star Wars: Rebellion covers a lot of the same ground, but even more than that, I feel like Nexus Ops captures the feel of playing Starcraft more than this game does. I thought this game was fine, but it's not one I think I'll ever seek out that often.

The only thing I don't like about this game, is the battle-mechanic of using your hand to arrange the outcome.

Other than that, I like every separate mechanic in the game (and there are several). 

Components are top-notch, rules are freely interpreted from the PC-game (ok, just different :p ), but do feel reminiscent.

Too bad I've only been able to play it 2 times.



Despite this being the second game I ever bought, I've sold it off, I've only played it 3 times over 7-8 years. Sold off to get some space in my closet :)

The rulebook is horrible, as per FFG tradition ;)

I'm not sure I like this game. There is a problem with the starting planets. I really think that each player should start with the exact same materials and have to fight to hold the VPs. 

The more I think about this game, the less I like how it plays. I really wish it captured more of the PC game's strategies. How certain units counter other units. Expanding to other bases. Rushing, etc. What's with the multiple planets and minuscule army sizes. I don't like the whole combat / special powers card drawing system. I just feel that the game should've felt more like a war game instead my base always feels vulnerable and battles weaken you to a point where the other players immediately come in and wipe you out. Also, no ghosts with nukes :(

Pro Starcraft:
+ Its near on the PC game
+ Good Material, minis, markers, etc
+ Good gameplay with 2-6 players
+ Low luck Game becaus its a card base Conflict managment game
+ Good Instruktion
+ Very Balanced Races

Contra
- Long Instruktion (50 Pages), the first plays you have to watch in it a lot of times
- many Extrarules
- You can not use all Minis you have. To many Material is useless...
- More than 1 Houre to explane the first time
- You need a group with a lot of time, 6 houres for real!

All is resumed on the board and we can find some aids on internet very useful. We must familiarize us with each faction. Battle is fun, with lots of surprise.  I love it!

RATING: 6.3
Impossible to judge after one play, but this seems an odd duck... A number of elegant and streamlined systems are layered atop of one another until the end result is fairly ungainly. Surely it is a game the rewards many plays, since it all but requires players to memorize the decks and units of all other players to be able to gauge odds. By no means terrible, but a bit more game than it might need to be to achieve the same effect.

This was my last attempt to play/buy games of these kind... too much wargame-like for my current taste... rules are not flowing freely.. too many things to pay attention to... and, even without considering the effort and the time it requires, IMHO it offers less fun and much less interesting strategical choices than simpler (and nicer) games. It is only a matter of taste, so please look at games I like more to see if you are like me (then better to avoid this tile) or not :)

As far as many-player sci-fi conquest games go...this is the cat's pajamas!  The bee's knees!  Sweet merciful crap this is fun!  Different lines of development, plans, chaos, and oh my god the carnage!  Corey and Christian did a fantastic job of translating the PC game features into a boardgame.  The races are more than just different on the surface - they are truly different experiences.  Don't believe me?  Experience the difference between losing a figure in combat as the Zerg vs. losing one as the Protoss.  Awesome!  Probably too generous with the rating, but I really don't see this dropping below 8, even after the bloom is off.  

Oh...and true three hour playing time!  Really great stuff.  Wow!

Wish I played it more. Have to rank it down because it is sooooo complex... Every player needs to know the 50pg rulebook backwards.

So have finally started playing this more often with my brother and it really isn't that complex at all. It's a horrible system to have to learn from a rulebook, but once you know it, it's quite straightforward.

This is a very rewarding and engaging wargame. It's brutal and cut-throat, but it's also fast. I am finally seeing what all the fuss was about!

A good midway game between a short Euro and a long strategy game like Twilight Imperium. Short-ish, but still depends on good strategic thinking and flexibility. Preserves the feeling of the computer game well. Also, the game-within-a-game of placing orders is an excellent mechanic. Victory point mechanic can be kind of unfair - you need to do well consistently to win, and a setback can easily take you out of the running.

RATING: 6
One play. It seems that the initial setup can be very important. Having a neighboring unoccupied planet can be a distinct advantage, having to share one puts you at an immediate disadvantage. Be careful to protect your initial base, losing can set you back quite a bit. Although, if you can try to rush your special victory condition, it may not matter as much. Seems like learning all the techs and how your units interact is important, and would come with more plays.

What can I say; this is a game (if not the only) where my heavy eurogamer best friend (Nodens77) and I agree. 

It has the perfect blend between Ameritrash (love it) and Euro (despise those), in short it's a game that allows to have lots of fun without getting tired or wasted (which in my opinion is the purpose of any game). Even if you've got the worst luck with another player blocking all your attempts to interact with the other ones, it should been a delightful game.

P.S. The rating would be higher if the play time were shorter.

I have played this game twice with my brother. Both times followed pretty much every Starcraft game I ever played. You build, you battle, and then there is a winner. However, rather than the nuances of the video game where certain skills offered a massive advantage in terms of tactics, you still need to just get lucky with the dice to win. I would opt for Star Wars Rebellion over this game as both are in the same time range and complexity.

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating after 1 play (3p, with Brood War).

I like the basic conception and see a couple of cool ideas, mechanisms-wise. Also, 4x is my genre, and miniatures alway add flavour. 

However, the game has 2 significant downsides: 
1.) bad handling. Constant need for checking reference sheets since it's hard to distinguish and to keep track of the various unit types. Confusing, frustrating. ...yet one might say that this is an ambivalent aspect. Having the coice between many different units is actually nice, no doubt.
2.) downtime, last but not least due to my complaint above. The constant need to look up stats results in an unnecessarily long total play time.

And on top of that all, Starcraft really is a beast to learn. The rules are among the heaviest I have seen from FFG so far.

I wish I could get a group together for this all the time.  Totally worth the time and effort in getting a game together.

The production in this game is excellent. It is one of the older assymetrical dudes on a map games, and I think that it holds up well. I think it would get played more if it wasn't OOP. This is also one of the first deckbuilding games, and in that respect I think that it is very innovative.

RATING: 3
I don't get it. If you like Starcraft why waste 4  hours playing an analog version when you could have spent that time playing the real thing?  If you have 4 hours to kill and you want play a 4X sci-fi game play Nexus Ops twice.  Or even better play Nexus Ops and watch a movie. There are some interesting sub-systems in here but the card-combat system is pointless chrome, like writing down your move secretly in a game of checkers.  Otherwise this is a typical FFG production.  Great components and presentation, too much stuff, too much chrome, and more complicated than it needs to be. I still don't get it.

I got to play a 3-player game and this was a lot of fun, despite me and the other new player making tons of mistakes.  The action deployment system is neat.  It is a lot of fun trying to plan the best place and order to put your pieces out, and that also led to a lot of our 1st game mistakes.  The system is fun and encourages a lot of battles.  The only downside is the playtime.  We took like 3 1/2 hrs. w/ explanation and playing.  It would speed up now that we know the game, but there are still a lot of decisions/worker counting maximization/battle resolving/etc. each turn that will take time.  A 6-player game would be looong.

It's not Ameritrash! (This is due to the fact that it doesn't suck.) 

Starcraft is a great hybrid game, i.e. a game where you fight each other with *shock* PLASTIC(!) miniatures, and is ALSO well designed and balanced. 

The combat is diceless, the mechanics are innovative (order stacks,  battle cards), the game has an economy with limited resources, victory points, catch the leader mechanics...

The only warning I will give is that I enjoy the game more because I have played the computer game. If you are not familiar with the computer game you probably shouldn't buy the board game, although many of the people I have played it with have still enjoyed the game without experience of the computer game.

This game deserves a lot more table time than it currently gets, but I've got a couple players who don't like it. I think it's because SC is very slippery and dynamic -- you can't really turtle and build a big involved game-winning machine. This to me is its strength. I think SC is in a long line of FFG games that sets poor expectations and undermines an otherwise excellent game.

The expansion is a very nice addition to the game. Kind of wish they'd do more.

RATING: 6
For a big game, it's pretty approachable, with only some of the combat twists requiring minutae to be studied. The game is slower than I expected from the rules explanation, with people having to place orders in reverse and react to other people's play. And the combat I expected faster as well with only one card to play per skirmish and it's resolved, but it takes time to find the best cards and weigh against expected defense. To play well you also need to study your technology deck and choose a complementary building strategy, which takes more time. So obviously the game goes faster with experience and study, but I was hoping and expecting faster from the get-go. But at least it delivers on the promise of strategic choice combined with tactical game play and I can see the rating rising with repeat play.

Bought this game at 1/3 it's normal price! The box was somewhat damaged but other than that, no big deal. Components in perfect condition (apart of the stands of flying units, but well...) and game looks gorgeous!

Another go in this game it is settled. This is the type of game you want to play with regulars. Buddies who commit to making an effort in knowing this game really well. Whenever a new player is brought into it, it takes painstakingly long! I believe it should be fairly reasonable to bring playing time down to 2,5 - 3 hours with 4 players. But it needs to be insisted on. So this is definitely not the type of game you want to introduce to casual players... stick to Stone Age instead... or Bohnanza! :)

Major complaint - the cardboard pieces, although they look nice, are really bad quality! Since the navigation routes won't fit properly into the planets, they easily start to tear and wear, so I won't even bother to attach them, which takes away some of its gorgeous looks! That's what happens when games are made in China! No getting around it and FFG just won't stop selling worse quality for the same price! That really bothers me!

- Rules are exhausting! 40 pages of little details. But the book is well structured and there are lots of tips. A good work.

I've said before I don't like the combination build & explore with warring in games. This is one that's heavy on warring, but I still like it. I really like the war system, even though I didnt fight too much in my first game. We'll see in future plays if my rating is this high (8.5) due to my peaceful win (the other four fough two by two) or if it holds.

There is one flaw. The red player (don't remember the names) have a personal goal card to win (whatever they are called) that is by far the easiest way to win the game.

Los componentes son muy buenos pero nos defraudo terriblemente. Se quedo bastante corto para las expectativas que teníamos. Poca interacción general, esperábamos un mayor abanico de opciones.

Initial thoughts after first play, long & a little too complicated for my tastes. To do well, I think this game needs a lot of familiarity that would only come from more than a few plays and also having played the video game (which I am completely unfamiliar with). 

On the other hand, it is interesting blend of combat systems and getting to customize your armies in an interesting way. I like how they handled the z-axis.

On the other hand, there were some pretty wild point swings at the very end of this particular game which felt very very random to me.

First play our host had pre-set the board so we could jump in a little faster. I liked this as it cut down playing time a bit (about 4 hours for a 4P), but it would be interesting to participate in creating the board.

Based on one play: I would not suggest paying for the first time with six players as the game can be very long and there can be a lot of down time especially since the game is combat heavy. This its a fighting game so you cannot hide in one area as everything is connected, you must advance your tech and books quickly to survive. I did find that the special victory conditions were not the must balanced but I am sure at less players the game would be better. As a big fan of the video game I can say that it is fairly similar except that resources are more abundant.

Incredibly addictive game play.  Much like the computer game, it takes a while to learn the units and how to use them most effectively.  The factions are more or less balanced, and there is no rolling of dice.  My favorite war game.  Though I still need to play once with the correct rules...

This is my favorite strategy game to date.  I bought it because of how much I loved the video game, but I've come to realize that it's still the best Sci-Fi strategy game out there.  I think it has some very highly tuned mechanics that interact with each other very well and, when played with experienced players, does a great job of balancing good war gamer skill with player diplomacy.  I could go on and on, but I think this game perfectest game ever =)  I say perfectest because I will never say that something can't be improved upon, but this game comes closest to date.

Good, tight game. There are several layers of interacting strategy. The stacking of the orders allows a lot of player screwage both through blocking and bluffing. Complex card combat system that takes some getting used to, but it is much better than just rolling dice because you have some control over what you are doing. Overall, a tight, tense game that makes you think on multiple levels and is all about player interaction. The small maps and the objectives force players to interact almost immediately and throughout. Great adaptation of the video game which I love as well. It feels similar to an RTS because the pace is quick, and you always have to be thinking ahead but also willing to adapt on the fly depending on what your opponents do. There are several strategies available for each faction, and the components are excellent. Works well with up to three players; with 4 or 6, I would suggest 2v2 or 3v3 matches, like the video game (you will obviously need to alter the victory conditions, but this makes the game deliciously complex). Almost all of the negative comments on here are from people who played once and couldn't understand the rules. This takes more commitment than that to fully enjoy. It probably won't start shining until about your third play when you start to put everything together.

RATING: 10
Very, very cool. I was skeptical when the design notes talked about how cards work like hit points, and you shuffle in technologies. But it all works really well. Any element of the game can be decisive.

I now mostly play with a simplifying variant (and with Brood War): No modules (except supply), special-victory leadership cards only (no II or III), predetermined board geometry with random planets, no resource depletion or tokens, no guard or defend, certain event cards related to the above removed.

This keeps the core of the game (card play and order play) but removes numerous special rules.

Sweet spot seems to be 3 or 4, but 3 might turn into 2 vs.1.  Very thematic and fun!  Not that I think it matters much, but it seemed to be quite true to the computer game.

Either the Kindergarten version of Twilight Imperium III, or Nexus Ops on steroids.

First learning game finally happened... and it was great! Lots of fun!
A lot of mistakes even though we left out quite a lot. But we had fun blowing each other up any way.
Left out the event cards, constructed an even map without z-axis routes, skipped rules about force mining and no special victory conditions. But got the important parts correct about building, colonizing, researching and battling. Fun! We immediately saw that there are BIG differencies between the races, as it should be in accordance to the PC game.
Rate it 9 directly and then we'll see.
Second game and again the deciding factor was that we forgot to build transports which meant we couldn't attack when we had to. Need to remember: Build transport before attacking!
Great fun anyway! Possible 10 rating (same as 'A Game of Thrones') with more plays.

Rating after first complete play. I expected something much shorter than what we ended up with (4 hours w/ 3 players).

Get past the daunting setup time, hundreds of game pieces, and tons of upgrades and card modifiers and there's a fairly straightforward and flexible combat game here. I'm amazed at how it captures the feel of the RTS game. I'm a little disappointed in how units don't natively have abilities but that the combat cards determine their power -- that's my key complaint (shouldn't a battlecruiser have more strength than a zergling?). But it has a lot of depth and complexity to it.

Really good game, where planning is everything. There are a couple rules that seem fiddly, but once you get to play a whole turn it is pretty much clear what you must do to get through each turn.

Too long for the amount of game.  I'd much rather play Nexus Ops five times.  Some neat ideas (the jumps between planets) in the game that appear "broken"? - the lack of freedom to move stifled some beat on the leader opportunities and isolated some players with only one route out.  How can there be only one route out of a planet?  I thought this was in space?  Sure, maybe some planets could be closer, but you should always be able to travel between any two.  Loved the order mechanic.  Tech cards seemed insignificant and I was playing Humans that these were supposed be the species strength.  Halfway through a 5 player game it was obvious that two could not win, then there was the king-making.  Never played the video game...  I don't play video games...  but I don't think that makes any difference.  Cool looking game though...  it just lacks soul and seems tossed together...

Lots of depth and strategy with very little randomness. It's a very well designed game that allows for lots of variety from play to play. The downside, however, is the playing time, which is around one hour per player in most cases. Combined with the fact that the game is very brainburning at all times (even during other players' actions), it is quite an exhausting experience.

RATING: 8.5
Awesome simulation of the RTS style of computer game. Reminds me of Nexus Ops in several ways, but with far more depth, variety and replayability (due to the more complex rules and the different races available). Also has way more components! Definitely a game that takes a good number of plays to properly explore.

The abstraction to a larger planet-based scale works well (as opposed to what could have been more of a skirmish-based wargame).

The way the order tokens are placed & executed keeps people involved throughout, rather than waiting while all the other players perform their turns separately.

The combat system is perhaps a little convoluted but does introduce some unpredictability without resorting to dice. It will take a long time to learn all the nuances of each race's units & cards. The special abilities on cards and the technology cards that can be purchased and added to your own personal combat deck lend it some of the feel of a CCG.

Because the board scales (2 planets per player) this game genuinely plays well with the whole range of player numbers.

The rules are definitely longer than was needed and they repeat themselves on multiple occasions. Still, this is better than having unclear rules. Unfortunately there are a few errors on the cards, summary sheets & the back page of manual - really should have been checked more thoroughly before release, but its all covered in the official FAQ.

Good integration of theme & excellent components - except for some bent figures and the well-known issues with broken stands on the flying units (I had 15!!!) But those are easily glued back together & figures can be straightened with a quick blast from a hair-dryer.

Huge box - even with this amount of plastic to store, it is still too big!

NOTE: Loudest & most realistic box fart I've experienced so far!

After finally getting this game to the table, I've been playing it weekly for months now. I love it. Have not tried the expansion yet, though I fear it might make the game too chaotic (particularly the leadership cards.) I feel the strategy and variety is incredible, which deeply feeds into my personal preferences.

RATING: 6
Beautiful components, does a wonderful job of replicating the Starcraft units and tech tree. But with all the complexity, there just aren't enough turns before the game ends. Because of my own mistakes I actually spent 3 hours playing and never had a single combat. The order system is designed to make it easy to our-maneuver or trick opponents, I found it more frustrating than fun to have all your plans unravel because of one mistake. I admire the design, but it's just too complicated and not fun enough.

I will likely never play this again unless backed into a corner.  Not that it's a bad game, in fact I thought the mechanics were pretty good.  My only beef with the game is how completely you can be screwed over by turn order on *the* turn that matters.

But the amount of time it takes to play this game is just ludicrously long and not worth my time.  I would much rather spend my time playing 4-8 other games in the time it takes to play this one.  There's no way this game will take less than 5-6 hours, and the only thing I'm willing to play which is that long is Arkham Horror.  I'm not interested in the property, so the flavor is pretty meaningless.

This game packs a truly epic feel into a simple ruleset and streamlined mechanics and can be played very quickly for this style of game. The plastic minis are amazing, too. After a few plays of this, I've determined that its not exactly my style of game. You can do a lot of really sneaky moves by placing order markers on top of other people's stacks, thus delaying their movements. I also am not very good with the combat system.

I don't remember whey I ranked this game so low.  Probably because we played for hours, and the person who won, was the one who just hid in the corner and kept to himself, seemingly doing nothing.

Now that I've tried again, I remember.  It's a video game simulation.  As in, "Let's take a fun frenetic video game, slow it WAY WAY down, make you manage hundreds of similar but different bits, and insert lots of down-time."  I'd rather just play the video game.

I played for 2 hours this afternoon, and we only made it through a single round.  When my wife called saying, "I need you to come home right now, the kitchen's flooding," I was relieved.

This is dripping with theme from the original computer game.  However, the game pace (if not the duration) moves a bit too quickly to really develop a dynamic strategy beyond a single technology pursuit.  The special victory conditions seem to come into play too quickly and the game feels better suited to small unit rushes than the epic large and mixed unit conflicts found in the computer game.  I like the reverse order mechanics and the unit diversity, but I just wish there was a bit more game and a bit less combat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Talk about a love-hate relationship.  The StarCraft PC game, while long since relegated to the shelf, is still a game and lore I remember fondly.  The board game would probably not stand as well on its own without being as drenched as it is in Blizzardisms.  I'm undecided about the game's arduous planning phase that tends to lead to wacky, unpredictable results during execution -- would the game be better without that strategic side and just played as a straight tactical game, almost Risk-style?  Hard to say without trying, but I do plan to try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's cluttered (as someone who's not into the computer games I think there's too many unit types) and not very beginner-friendly, but once I got past the learning stage I genuinely enjoyed it. Some of the game mechanics are quite good (love the way orders are given and played out) but most importantly, it has a LOT of replayability value. This makes up for the fact that games often seem to end after quite a small number of turns. The sci-fi atmosphere also feels very tangible which is nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very deep and engaging game. Didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Turns flow pretty smoothly and there's a lot of things to consider every turn. Not very much luck involved at all, despite the random event cards.

I only have two complaints so far-
1. The game can take way too long.
2. It seems there are some exploitable loopholes in the rules, especially involving a certain module

Not being the hugest fan of FFG's other "big box" games, I found Starcraft to be a breath of fresh air.  Definately captures the theme of the PC game on cardboard.  Once players know the rules, the game is actually fast paced.  Loses a couple points for length (average 4 player game takes about 3 hours), but then again what FFG game doesn't take at least that long.

 Can't wait and from reading the rules looks to me that it should play quite well. The building mechanics looks similar to Warcraft the board game, but the rest of the rules are quite unique. After one play, really enjoy the game. Played with 6 players, took a while to get through the first turn but once we started turn 2 it went quite smoothly. Look forward to the next game.
 Played another 4 player game and it only gets better, learning to manage the resources, watching enemies from various fronts/backs. Great stuff.
After a number of plays I have to increase my rating, I really like the flow and theme of this game. It has a certain appeal and the group feels the same way.

The world doesn't need two multi-stranded strategic empire building space games, why anyone in their right mind thought one company needed two is beyond me.

Not worth playing if you don't know and like Starcraft the video game.  The fluff is excellent, and I like the combat resolution system.  By having a hand of cards to resolve combat, you can plan ahead and not be screwed by the dice while still allowing for a random outcome.

However, overall we find the game unsatisfying.  We suffer from "It just ends."

I've only played once, and I really wanted to like it, but it just felt really slow. It didn't help that this was much harder to teach than TI3 -- the core mechanics are okay, but the exceptions are spread out all over the rules instead of all being in one place. In TI3, all of the exceptions have to deal with ships or strategy cards, so that makes things way simpler.

After 2 two player games: certainly has a few things in common with Nexus Ops (similar resource mechanism and combat unit building), but the order token placement and combat mechanism make the game feel much different. A much broader game without a significant increase in playing time. So far I like it a lot. I do need to try a few multiplayer games.
Update: played a four player version and found the order placement mechanism to be more frustrating than fun. Planet placement becomes critical with more players and can result in an unbalanced start.

It has been a very long time since I played this. I love starcraft and I remember this game being really cool with a unique action resolution mechanic. Custom pieces for each race with up to two players per race means you have a ton of REALLY cool miniatures.

OK - How to rate this based on a first play?  Part of the trouble with asymmetric forces is knowing what the other forces can and can't do.  That comes with practice playing the game, but until then the game is tentative as folks are uncertain how to proceed.  Overall, not that complex of a game with plastic bits and decent iconography to help one along.  Certainly a focus on tactical elements lets one dive right into conflict and areas of overlap.  But was it exciting enough to want to play over and over?  Not for me.  Perhaps if I play the game a few more times and learn the various sub-systems as well as the characteristics of the differing races.  There appears to a good game there if one commits to it.  As a result, this game is likely to be one game where one does better the more one plays.  But will this happen if the game is only played sporadically?  I don't think so.  So a warm "meh" for me now.  Would like to try to play some more, especially if with practice, the game does only last a couple of hours.  Now to see if I can actually get the opportunity.  Rating provisional at this point pending further plays.

12-10-2014. Rated after 1 game.
Starcraft: The boardgame is an older FFG title (OMG, I love FFG) I was recently able to pick up a while ago on the Dutch equivalent of Craigslist. 

The game is a Twilight Imperium 3 light-ish game, in which you 'Explore' (well.. not really), 'Expand' (yes!),'Exterminate' (surely) and 'Exploit' (literally). In this game, you win by eliminating your opponents, get 16 VPs or get your special objective. 

The game is played over rounds. Each turn, you can place 4 actions on the board. You can move onto a planet or move your troops on your own planet with move, you can take a build action to build buildings/research and research to upgrade your/get new units / buy combat cards or new technologies. You have 2 tokens of each. The top counter is resolved first, but all tokens on each planet are stacked on top. So if your opponents move token is on top of your build token.. he can attack first before you can build defenses. You can also forego an action to get a special event card that is resolved at the end of the round.

Combat is resolved in an interesting way. Basically, the attacker lines up the troops and assigns which unit attacks which. Excess units are put into support units. Then each player plays a combat card supplemented with upgrade card if able. Then, you look at your combat card and see if the units on the combat card match the frontline unit, if this is the case you use the outer and often best set of attack and health numbers. If it does not match, you use the inner mostly less impressive ones. You then add support bonus to see what your combat strength is. If you beat your opponent and you can target him legally he removes his unit from the board. (ie. if your opponent has a flying unit and your unit cannot target flying units, you do not inflict damage). You do the same if your opponents combat strength exceeds your units. If at the end of combat at least 1 defending unit remains, you've lost and need to retreat.

After resolving all actions, the turn ends. Victory conditions are checked and players may look at their event cards and play 1. 

Opinion:
I love Starcraft. I've played with 3, which made for the fact that each faction from the starcraft universe was represented. I got completely killed, but had a great time being killed. Game is streamlined, plays relatively quickly and gives you a nice 4x feel. Great game, want to play more.

--Nov2007-- Fun stuff.  My first experience playing was much more amusing than I had expected it to be.  I'm not sure that my Starcraft-the-video-game fanatic eldest (12) will like it as much as I do, but as a relative Starcraft-n00b I thought the game provided a bit of the flavour of the video game in an entirely playable package.  I really liked the order stacks; the card-driven combat was interesting; the minis are nice (and this from someone that prefers cardboard counters!)  All told, a really nice package, and one I'd be happy to own and play again.  Rating might even increase, if I could get it to the table frequently.
--Jan2008-- Sure enough; bumped to 8.

RATING: 6
Huge sprawling space battle...   kinda...  but much more than that.   I prefer this by far to Twighlight Imperium 3, and next to Tide of Iron this is my favorite of the large FFG games.   Though I havn't played Starcraft the video game, It definately feels right in terms of how you build in this one.  There are many decisions to be made and a lot of planning, yet all of it is truncated to the essentials...  very efficient game play!  While not all of your actions are exciting, I disagree with those that say there is a lot fo down time.  In one 5 player game, there were 100  actions taken in just over 3 hours.   Having said that, this is a Conquest game and as such requires a certain type of gamer.  With the individual faction win conditions the game is quite managable for time sake and after an initial explanation, this is very easy to pick up for new players...  while having a lot of depth for returning players.

Update:  As of a second play I think there are multiple learning curves for this game...  learn the basic...   learn the races...  learn how to stop the Zerg.  This has lead me to believe that the Zerg special win conditions are a bit easier to accomplish than the other 4 factions, but only more time with the game will tell.

... has passed 30 minutes in my mind, when suddenly, I see the clock and realize that have passed 3 hours! There's some better way to have fun?

A nice strategic and thematic game. Certainly I will learn more how to play while playing :)

You have to choose a race and faction to play with. Each of these factions have his own distinctions in powers and objectives. Owning more areas and planets will let you earn more mineral and gas (and also "victory points"), letting you build more units, builds, etc. Whose can handle better his resources in building and in battle,  wins.

Not for Eurogamers. Despite its license, both the rules and strategy are complicated and complex. The game has so many different options (eg. building units, technology trees, resource management vs. conquest points), that you'll want to play a "practice" 3-hour game or 2-player games first. Meaty but not for the weak!

RATING: 9
A game in which there are many decisions, each of them exciting and interesting, and no one clear way to proceed. Plenty of player interaction, a thrilling conclusion, and the ability to create great stories. The only reason it isn't higher is that it tends to take 5 hours and therefore requires significant advance scheduling.

After several plays, I upgraded from an 8 to a 9. This game is extremely deep, there is a great deal of opportunity for player skill, and yet it still often feels like "anyone's game". The excitement level is always very high. This would be a serious contender for my favorite game, period, if it were only possible to play it more often.

Meh. Played a 2 player game that lasted upwards of 4 hours. The owner has played many times and even though I'm new to this particular game, my turns were lightning fast, as I've basically played this game before. It borrows and borrows and borrows until the mechanic SEEMS so far removed that it's unique. During explanation I was like "worker placement", "area control", etc. It is however a pretty fun little skirmish game. I thought that the board was too small, in a 2 player game, to offer up any real options, but, alas, it did....for hours...and hours...and hours. 

I really need to play again to make any real judgment, but at this point its a definite pass...at least on buying it. :)

You get these by controlling planetary areas which grant Victory points at the end of each turn. First person to 15 points wins. Otherwise you can get your factions special victory condition, which could be having a base on 3 different planets, controlling every area on 2 different planets, controlling 6 different victory areas etc.
Its all about holding planetary areas. To do this you need to be able have troops there that can beat off anybody that tries to attack you and knock you out of those areas. So the game consists of building up the right types of troops and fighting with them. If your main opponent is going for marines and tanks then you want to bring flying units at him because then he can't shoot them effectively. Thats pretty much all the game is about. Its like Axis & Allies. There is no diplomacy and the strategies aren't deep at all. You have little skirmish fights and you'll win or lose, but they never get that exciting really. Then you get to the Stage III part of the game due to the event deck and someone has won the game and it all feels pretty unclimactic.
The good parts are the figures, the planning phase, and I guess the combat system is pretty good.
I spent any downtime in the game having little fights with the figures. I borrowed my neighbours unused Zerg monsters and had a little shootout with sound effects and everything. It was *epic*. More enjoyable than actually playing the boardgame, but my other neighbour said it was childish and distracting. I said he was anally retentive then invaded his home planet and blew his base up in the game and he threw a big sulk, so HA! to him :).
As you know from reading the rules, In the planning phase you put down 4 orders on different planets one at a time. When you're scrapping over a small cluster of planets you're blocking and covering up your opponent's orders with your own, so you can mobilise in to his areas before he can build reinforcements and stuff like that. Its quite tactical getting your orders in the right order, and trying to guess what he is up to. You get a huge advantage in going after your opponent, so seating order is important. We played 4 player, and I was at war with the guy to my right. That put him at a huge advantage, as I got to place the last order on him 3/4 of the time (other 1/4 time I was first player). Its a good system, but its not *that* great. Other games do the bluff and outwitting thing a lot better.
Finally, the combat system is pretty good. I like the way they've managed to put the all the different units capabilities on to the base combat cards, with more special effects being put in to the deck via technology purchases. It *can* be quick, but a lot of the time the other players were taking *ages* picking their cards for the skirmishes, and this caused a lot of downtime.
Lets start summarising. I was hoping for the ultimate 2-6 player game, that I could have a quick skirmish with with a few, and it turns in to an epic war with more.
I think it failed for me on both counts, mainly because I want more diplomacy and "breadth of gameplay". My favourite games like Struggle of Empires and Mare Nostrum have lots of things going on. Starcraft doesn't have any gameplay breadth because its all about building the right units, getting the tech cards that match them in to your combat deck, and shooting the enemy. Because of the lack of any other form of interaction though, experienced players should be able to rip through games of this *really* quickly. I could see a 2-3 player game being over in an hour. I think 5-6 players isn't worth it because it adds on downtime, and you never get to interact with the other players, you'll still only have 2-3 neighbours.
But I'd personally play something like Bonaparte at Marengo because there is much more cerebral challenge, much more depth of strategy and tactics. Or I'd play something more interesting and thematic like Marvel Heroes. And at the higher player end I'll play something with more breadth.
After putting all my thoughts together and writing this mini-review for you though, I've noticed that I had kind of written the game off after my first real play. I sat down in the best of mindsets for playing it, humming the Starcraft and Battlezone music to myself, having little shootouts with the figures, saying "Lets go Marines!" everytime I did a mobilise (my right neighbour really appreciated all this ;)). But the game still left my a bit bored. I'd definitely play it again, but its really plumetted down my wishlist from first place to down to the bottom. Its still *on* the list though, because I think with 2-4 experienced players, when you're in the mood for a fun simple shootout its a great fit, so don't let me discourage you too much. I guess the easiest way to explain it is that its quite a few tactical step-ups from Nexus Ops.

Forbidden Stars is a streamlined and better working reinterpretation of this. Starcraft makes sense only with a constant, dedicated group of players already familiar with the franchise, especially the purpose of all units.

Lots that I really love about this game, but everyone seems to balk at the play length. Combat with it's deck-building, second-guessing, rewarding agression (somewhat tempered by the expansion?) is fun. Order placing ingenious. Bits are beautiful. Never played the computer game. 

Even though about 17 of the aerial vehicles came with their stands broken off, I could not bring myself to avail FFG of their legendary customer service, and instead just manned-up and got out the sand-paper and super glue - the production on this was such a clear labour of love, that it seems churlish to put FFG at any additional expense. Great game! (Scaling seems good too, - plays well 2 player)

This game looks like a unsuccessful try to improve [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=347&Itemid=1]Game of Thrones[/url][/i], that achieves its objective in components (the miniatures are the best ones that I've ever seen), but not in game mechanics. The main problem with [i]Game of Thrones[/i] was the unbalanced map, and this is fixed in a clever way with a modular board. They also took away the support command, which added some difficulty; worked harder to give each faction a special feeling, even with special victory conditions for each of them, limited the number of orders available per turn, and allowed multiple orders in the same space, which is the main advance in the game and force players to think backwards. Nevertheless, some interesting features are also gone, like the Iron Throne auctions and the event cards, which now play a different role and have individual effects and not global ones. Overall, [i]Game of Thrones[/i] is still a better game, but this can be pulled from the shelves from time to time for a change.

The perfect rendition of the video game, without feeling like a re-hash.  Players grow their armies thru research, technology, troops, vehicles, and support buildings, and then conquer the galaxy to gain more resources to do more of the same.  3 roads to victory for each player, only 2 of which are the same for everyone.  The game usually comes down to the last turn, so it's always a nail biter until the end.  The components, as usual for Fantasy Flight, are top-notch.

Hands down the most difficult game I have ever taught. I want to wait until I have played it at least a couple more times before rating, as most of the time spent playing is getting familiar with the rules.

The game was definitely enjoyable, and I want to play it again. But I think the enjoyment factor will go way up after people get familiar with the rules. 

I am completely impressed with the unique gameplay though. I have never seen a game played in this way. I am excited to play again.

12-16-10 I liked how collecting and spending resources worked, and I liked the way the worlds were set up and the way the tech tree was set up. I didn't really like the order stack (though I realize that it's an important part of play), and I didn't really like how combat was set up. Had fun though and would gladly play it again. Don't think it's worth buying for myself though, as I'd never get my money's worth out of it.

This is a bloody, in-your-face game of conflict, battle, and conquering. Starcraft rewards the aggressor (it's better to be the hammer than the nail) and players can be eliminated on the first turn if they make a mistake. The game can take longer than it should and we are still tinkering with the best situation (# of players, composition of teams) for acceptable length of play.

Great game. Long the first time but that's to be expected.  Rating may go up after multiple plays.  The combat system seams weird but thats coming from someone who only watched combat.

I really want to love this game, with the nifty order-stacking resolution system, the novel deck-management approach to technology and combat, and soooo many unique sculpts + stands for flying units. But the sheer number of technologies and unit types (9 to 11) bogs the game down. Excellent homage for video-game fans, but the swath of units and technologies is harder to justify clunking the game up for me and necessitating more homework.

I'd love it if I had more time to explore this game. The originality and painstaking attention to video-game detail is commendable.

Screw it: I'd play this some more.

[hr]

Raised from 7 to 8. It's a blast to play (unit/tech complexity concern was overblown and allows for varied repeat plays), since you're fighting for VP spots immediately and ruthlessly, and only tech/upgrade when there happens to be leeway. For now, some unintuitive rule interactions create a lot of disappointments with sub-optimal plays. Hoping to iron this out and get more to the mind games, cunning plays and risk-taking (e.g. planning for a gold order you don't have yet, ensuring your Orbital Defense is out in time). 

Hoping at a high/expert level, the order-placement won't boil down to a couple of scripted plays in various situations (first-seat mode, last-seat mode, prevent-invasion mode etc).

All-out war from the get-go, with attackers getting good bonuses. Unlike with other games, there's no 'warm-up' or 'exploration' or any other get-to-know-you phase to ease into the conflict, just balls to the wall, and squeezing in research while you're busy replacing your fallen troops. Not for the faint of heart.

[hr]

Lowered design rating from 5 to 4, because there are too many unintuitive technicalities and 'glitches'. They provide a differentiator for the expert (e.g. Twilight Struggle), but I think it's overkill here, with all the complexity elsewhere. It's inexcusable that my plays can still be decided on technicalities and gotcha-moments. 

Glitches include destroying own stuff any time on turn (enabling pseudo-Liftoff base-replacement, weird liberation rules in team-play), Weasley Retrograde, the entire Defensive Support Module, force-mining to save workers, empty-base glitches (better to leave base empty than defend so attacker doesn't draw 5 cards on a Gold Mobilize), the bad rules on moving into an undefended enemy base (Runewars, Corey's later and more mature effort, handles it much better by calling it and interpreting it consistently as a battle), weird interactions with non-matching attack types + support units + splash damage + cloaking + sacrifice to enable weird-ass unit exchanges). The base game also messed up the Marine (splash damage!), made Archons too powerful (unproven, but in magicgeek I trust), and provided an orbital defense exploit in team-play. Too many oversights.

Plays best with an even number of players or teams. Difficult to teach new players as some of the mechanics have a steep learning curve and a newer player is almost surely going to lose to an experienced one. For that reason I hesitate to bring this out very often except among the most die-hard of Starcraft fans or those players who are already familiar with the game.

There is a wonderful little world to explore here - a great game. Play it with the original Starcraft music in the background for an epic experience.

One thing about the game that doesn't entirely convince me is the victory conditions. They tend to create winners who feel like they don't really deserve the win more often than not, which is unfortunate for such a long game. I wish they would have gone for something more simple and predictable, with a greater correlation between victory and strong on-board presence.

RATING: 7
[1 play] 5 players, 1 hour of rules explanation, 4 turns complete, 6 hours total, and probably 2-3 more hours until completion. Did I have fun? Of course. The game has some cool things going for it and I love the dynamics of our gaming group. Did I have 6 hours worth of equivalent gaming fun? Probably not, but that isn't necessarily a fair analysis given that it was the trial run of an admittedly epic game.

What I liked: The stacking of orders mechanic is great. The map of the planets and the "3-D" connections system between worlds is innovative. The bits are awesome and plentiful - if a bit bewildering in their variety.

What I didn't embrace: The learning curve is significant both in the initial learning of rules (and we are not at all inexperienced gamers in all styles of games), and what I expect will be a continued  steep learning curve in future games figuring out how to play well with the development trees and the interactions of units in battle.

What I didn't like: The pure length of the game. I am finding that while I enjoy wargames of significant length when played 2 player, I have less tolerance for monster games with lots of people than I used to. Each additional player adds downtime, chaos, and kingmaking potential that I find less and less enthralling when games start crossing the 3 or 4 hour mark with absolutely no end in sight. If it doesn't have a very realistic chance of wrapping up in under 4 hours, then multiplayer may not be for me. 

To sum up my thoughts, I'd enjoy playing this again, but I think I'd really prefer 3 players. (Maybe 4 players max.) 3 players would be an outstanding way to balance the bash the leader impetus and also bring gametime down to a realistic 3 or 3.5 hours.

Most recent play 9-11-09 at Garrett's with Michael, Carter, Joel, and Garrett.

Faster and better than Twilight Imperium III, except you don't get to have dreadnaughts. Starcraft: The Boardgame has similarities to both the computer version of the game and A Game of Thrones. There is a lot of complexity in the tech and development, and a lot to think about. Overall, it's a very good game, and not excessively long once people know the rule. The game works well with three players and as a partnership game for four. Six players is a bit much though.

After one three player game.  Hangs together well (I was expecting the worst).  Shorter than I thought it would be, which is good and also unexpected (3 hours and I sure it will be shorter with more plays).  GREAT production as a whole.  But there is SO much text on so many cards that you need to be aware of to play well.  Special powers, special victory conditions, special exceptions to special rules, etc., etc.  It's not something I swallow easily at all, but everything else is so great about the game (including and especially the core rules and combat system) that I am more than willing to give it more tries.Also, it seemed that three players (one for each race) was ideal for this game (which is unusual for any game) and that more players would make strategy less relevant.  And no one was able to build any of their big guns before the game ended, which was disappointing, but this was probably due to our inexperience.

45 oldalas szabálykönyv, 2-2,5 óra szabályismertető. Ha ez nem ijeszti el a játékosokat, akkor utána kaphatnak egy 1 órás játékidőt is érdekes módon. Mire kifejlesztettem a legerősebb egységemet a játékban már vége is volt.
Egy játék alapján nagyon nehéz megítélni ezt a társast. Nagyon komolyan kidolgozott, a számítógépes játékot hűen követő társasjátékról van szó. 3 különböző faj, 6 különböző nép, eltérő győzelmi célok és fejlődési utak. Nagyon sok különböző bolygó, amelyek felhelyezési lehetőségét még megtippelni sem merem olyan nagy szám lehet. Biztosan nehéz megunni. Egyértelműen több játékra van szükség a különböző fajok képességeinek, fejlesztéseinek átlátáshoz.
Rajongóknak egyértelműen ajánlott, mezei játékosok csak a fenti szabályismertetési idő kalkulálásával vágjanak bele.
Most még csak 7-est adok rá, de több játék után biztos vagyok benne, hogy nőni fog ez a szám.

[2011-12-20]
Meg is kapja a 8-ast tőlem. Mert a játékidő most bőven 2 óra felett volt és izgalmas végkifejletet hozott a második parti. A játék negatívuma a korábban említett hosszú szabályismertetés mellett nekem a fejlesztéskártyák, én már ezeket nem raktam volna bele, bár egyértelmű, hogy az azonos fajok közti különböző fejlesztési utak miatt kerültek bele, de ezekkel csak 2-3 játék után lehet igazán számolni, mikor az ember már pontosan tudja mit szeretne elérni. A játék másodjára még jobban tetszett.

[2012-03-10]
Visszateszem a pontot 7-esre. Egyrészt most volt egy 5 órás partink, igaz kiegészítővel, de ez már sok azért. Illetve a kezdő bolygók elég sokban hozzájárulnak a végső sikerhez. Továbbra is jónak tartom, de túl sok játék kell belőle, hogy igazán tudja benne az ember mit miért csinál.

This game is practically built for me.

Fierce, fast (pacing wise, game feels fast paced even though the game length is long) highly competitive and asymmetric just like its source of inspiration.

Dozens of thematic flavor rules and units/techs to memorize give this game a seemingly steep barrier to entry to those who have not played the computer game (in reality it's not nearly as bad as it seems). But for those who have, and are into this type of board game, this is a real treat.

Still, don't expect it to capture the computer game completely in feel. This is a board game set in the Starcraft universe that does a great job with the source material, but it's not really a 1:1 translation of the computer game. There's no direct representation of hidden tech, no scouting, no positioning, etc, which are defining features of a computer RTS game.

I will point out though that many of those elements are abstracted in a fun way -- Leadership cards (Brood War)  act like a build-order of sorts, with their variable unit and worker counts and double-blind simultaneous selection. Position your two Zealots at a "choke point" (Low unit limit area) and they can hold off a swarm of Zerglings for far longer than if you have them in the open field (high unit count area)

I've seen people say that games like Nexus Ops give the Starcraft feel better because of its fast-paced skirmish feel. This is laughable and a confession that you never played Starcraft -- asymmetry is front and center in Starcraft, so Nexus Ops's generic identical factions hold no candle.

I'm glad it does its own thing so well though instead of slavishly trying to adapt the computer game. Just happy that it even exists, and the valuable Starcraft license wasn't abused to make some crappy mass market game instead.

Finally, this is a skillful game, with all randomness and imperfect information being EXTREMELY manageable, from the hidden orders other players place to the cards you draw. You will feel in control of your destiny here.

The Brood:War Expansion is really, really, really, good -- this is one game where there is really no excuse not to have the expansion. It's just wasted potential without it.

[b]2 Player:[/b] Amazing competitive fast paced 2 player game. Probably my favorite way to play.

[b]3 Player:[/b] Great count for an FFA!

[b]4 Player:[/b] 2v2 works great in this game.

[b]5-6 player[/b]: Haven't tried yet. I imagine that they will be epic and the game length will be eternal. This style of game probably better left to Twilight Imperium; Starcraft is more focused on surgical strikes and paying attention to everything your opponent(s) are doing, so having too many opponents I imagine will detract from that.

The bits are awesome, the action stacking is clever and the tech growth is really engaging.  There's a whole lot of color here and for a while the game is quite enjoyable.  Where the game fails for me is that while the combat is nicely detailed, ultimately you spend a whole lot of time and energy tailoring your attack/defensive positions with your cards, min/maxing everything, when ultimately it ends up being just about as random as rolling dice (Yes, I know there is some hand management and card seeding from research).  To make matters worse you kind of have to manage the battles this way as the margins are so slim, you just aren't afforded the luxury to take this lightly.  This combat system makes me long for a quick throw of the dice and a CRT.  It's just so much work, for such uninteresting results, matching numbers, see who wins. Ugh, exhausting.

Throughout the game I kept feeling like this was constantly operating at 5 steps forward and 4 steps back, unless you weren't a target that turn in which case, the sheer level of upkeep for everything may have paid off.

I know that much of the visual design was taken from the video game, but I just found much of it confusing.  You are expected to know the names of all the units, you have no idea what the capabilities of these mysteriously named units are (Can this enemy's crazy unit attack air units?).  And the Icons are just unintuitive and/or busy.  The Build looks like some mobile lunar unit, and the Research looks like a futuristic building.  I know that you get used to this, but even still, the player aid is so busy that I have to get right up close to see what is going on on anyone's mat.  The units are also a bit confusing especially with the Marines and the Firebats. Even controlling the humans I had a hard time trying to figure them out.  And with so much clutter on the table, why not create a battle board so that battles can be clearly lined up and cards lain out accordingly.

I'm also not a fan of the end game.  It's pretty obvious that some players are unlikely to win at a certain point as everyone encroaches their victory conditions (especially in a 6 player game) so players are constantly forced to try to prevent a winner.  Because of the layout of the board, there are often times where players that can't win will be deemed responsible to hold back the leader.  It seems like this game will frequently end in a kingmaker situation.  For the player that is stuck biding time trying to slow the lead players I liken it to getting terminal cancer.  If you get the chemotherapy it can extend your life eight more months, but they will all be miserable vs letting the disease take hold, having one good month and one painful month then death. 

With six the game drags massively and the level of interaction is based solely on who can be reached, and ends up feeling like the most complicated game of Bang produced.  As one person put it, punch your neighbor in the shoulder and hope that he punches the next guy.  

I just can't see playing this when Nexus Ops just does it significantly better.  This feels so flaccid in comparison, and it's hard for me not to compare the two.

does a decent job at capturing the video game elements, but suffers from all the problems that typically bug me with wargames - although the game lasts for several hours, you only make a small number of very important decisions and getting one wrong means disaster.

I'm a huge fan of Starcraft (the PC game) as well as Starcraft 2.  Just seeing this in board game format is a dream come true.  It's rated so high because of this fact, coupled with the fact that it's actually executed well.  Not only as a stand alone board game, but the translation from PC to board game is really great!

Most concepts from the computer game translate well into the board game.  Do you get a lot of lower tier units out as fast as possible for map control and a rush strategy? Or do you turtle up, defend your base, and tech up to higher tier units?  If you can think of it in the computer game, you can do it in the board game! And it's viable.

Very well done game. This appeals to any StarCraft nerd who has grown out of the video game phase and actually wants to hang out with friends face to face. The game can be a bit lengthy so be prepared to only play one game in a night. This game has an extremely steep learning curve, but if you like starcraft, it's worth it.

RATING: 8.5
There is so much to love about this game I don't even know where to start. There is a lot to the game and it's a bit of work to get through the nearly 50 pages of rules but once you do the game is actually really intuitive and not difficult to play at all to play. The choices you make and the mechanics involved in everything from combat, turn orders, building and research are all really interesting and very well done and work together excellently. I was expecting the game to be a lot more complicated than it is considering all the pieces and options available to you. What you get is a really awesome sci-fi game about research abilities, conquering planets and blowing up everyone in your way. I love how you can really customize your army with different building upgrades, technologies and modules for different strategies. There are 3 races but even if two people use the same race they play out quite differently. Even with all the hype about this game I ended up liking it a lot more than I was expecting. All that and I haven't even mentioned how completely amazing all the artwork and plastic pieces are. I can't wait to play this again. The rulebook makes learning the game a much bigger chore than it should be considering the game isn't really that complicated in the end. Other than that the only downside to this game is that the whole concept and theme of the game just doesn't appeal to some people I normally play board games with so I'm not sure how often I'll get to play it. But it was a gift, so it's already earned it's spot on my shelf with the little of it I've played already.

Rating certainly is tentative, and I would like to give this another try, but I'm not sure that I care all that much for this.

It looked nice and played kind of quickly (but definitely not VERY quickly).  I liked the clear bases for the flying units, I'll admit it.  I found the game a little hard to keep track of, in terms of your opponents' abilities and in terms of order placement strategy.  But let's be honest: The most important thing to know is that if you haven't played Starcraft the videogame, you won't understand 80% of what the players who DO know Starcraft say.  There will be all sorts of creepy statements about sarges.

Starcraft leaves me feeling more like a production manager than a general, and I don't care for that. There is little scope for maneuver, and I find event cards dictating strategy rather than throwing curves at it.

The overwrought tech tree would be OK if it were in service of something larger, but after two plays it feels like tech tree uber alles. More play might reveal a better game, but I suspect I'll never find out.

Was very nervous picking this up, but the less random diceless combat made it an interesting gamble. I was really hoping for a good space-themed conquest game that gives that Twilight Imperium 'feel' for when you don't have 8 hours to devote but isn't a clone or 'lite' version of TI. That's what I got! It's a very different game from TI. Quite good and rather brutal. I'm thinking 4 would be the optimal players for this, but it's still good with 2 or 3; just have to be very aware when placing starting planets.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Okay I will say I in general do not like long complicated wargames.  My one play of this was very long, very tedious, and by the end I was bored.  So why did I try it in the first place?  I was a fan of the Starcraft computer game and the game looks cool and I got the opportunity to give it a try.  To tell that truth despite my overall not being trilled with it, I don't play this type of game that often so I was glad to have tried it.  I did like it a lot better than Twilight.  In fact I do not understand that constant comparison between these two games.  The combat is different, the role selection is different, the poltics are different.  Other than the game length I have a hard time finding a lot in common between them.  I got to play as the Zerg, it was a six player game.  I got penned in between two other people and had no room to expand and thus lost badly.  It is doubtful I will play this game again, but who knows I will not write it off as never, I did not consider the game in any way "broken" or anything.

[FFG 07 edition] {Fantasy war, computer game; tile-laying, resource-management, battle cards, variable-winning-goal; optimal 2p or 2v2} {Normal: 7; Galactic Conquest Variant: 6; Team play variant: 7.5} StarCraft is a nice galactic war game.  Although the rulebook is 48 pages long, it's easy to understand the system and mechanics. But players have to remember some fiddly rules.  I love the stack of order system - it requires players to plan in advance what they should do, not just react to what happens.  The battle system is quite nice - both attackers and defenders have certain advantages, thought it takes time to resolve a single battle (rolling dice is faster, but I don't care).  The victory conditions are very obvious. It's easy to notice what player is winning. Resources are very tight and it's difficult to advance every military unit or technology. Players have to adapt their growth path smartly.  Player interaction is very strong.

The components are nicely made and informative. The miniatures are colorful, nicely molded and the plastic is soft enough to avoid breaking.  However, it's bad that the reference sheet has an error and the order reference of regrouping phase at the end of the rulebook is wrong.

RATING: 6.5
Not bad for what it is. I am awful at this sort of game, so it's hard for me to comment; I end up trying to turtle and just mind my own business and getting summarily slaughtered (especially since my opponent was playing the Zerg). But it had some interesting elements and I'd give it a few more goes (hopefully with more than 2 people), because it was interesting even if I'll never win at it.

-rule book not well layed out

-protoss have best unit and can get it early in the game, also have a card cycling advantage

-turtling far to beneficial

-long time to play for not much action

-Zerg could potentially knock people out in the first turn

-order placement was terrible in that you had to try and plan whole turn then place last order you want to resolve first!  blocking of orders intentially or not stopped you from doing anything exciting

looked like they traded on name and quickly launched a nice looking but poorly play tested game

RATING: 6
What I really liked: The hidden movement chits were inspired. What a great idea. It requires you to think backwards, but it really gives you great power to mess with the turn sequence and initiative. I also liked the way the new technologies were shuffled into your deck instead of being given to you outright.

What I kinda liked: You begin the game in close quarters, so the fighting starts almost immediately. Plus, attackers have a serious advantage.

What was sort of a drag: Too many bits, cards, chits to juggle in my player area. Plus, the fighting part itself wasn't that much fun. Too much information on the cards. Lotsa numbers, lotsa text, lotsa icons. Yuck. Here's where they could have borrowed some sugar from Nexus Ops, where combat is short, sweet and simple.

Overall, I think this may be a game that I'll use to scratch the space game itch more often than Twilight Imperium 3. TI:3 still rules, imo, but it's a heavyweight, and Starcraft is a middleweight. Pound-for-pound, Starcraft may be the better game.

Theme-wise not my thing, but it was an OK game. Things I liked: action selection mechanism, the flexible  planet configuration. Less keen on the card-based combat which really slowed things down, and the multiple unit types which seemed unnecessary given that a game is only going to last about 6 or 7 turns. Not that much sense of story arc; we start, we expand a little, we finish.

Played once 4p & won, though I think due to having a very lucky special victory card (I win at 15 pts, everyone else 20) and jumping to a very early lead.  I found the amount of conflict plus brain burning toward end of game w/ action stacks to be discomforting.  I'm not sure I like how intense this is, but I should play again.

Upon reading some reviews, I think that it's the game length that might turn me off.  Conflict + brain burn + 3-4 hrs ... still, worth another shot.

Gorgeous components. Its neat that there's a lot to do, with numerous technologies and unit combinations to try out.
Way too much 'stuff', with almost a dozen assorted piles of cards in the game, and too many mechanics that don't interact well going on at once.  Individually some of them are clever; like shuffling the technology cards into your deck.  But the combination is very clunky. There can be a lot of snowball effect, and the randomness of the event cards can be annoyingly swingy. 
Seems difficult to play as a free for all; the sides which avoid combat initially will have a large advantage. Combat is highly detrimental to both sides. 

House rule:
When a battle starts, assign frontline and support units as normal, but do not decide on skirmishes. The attacker and defender each take turns choosing one of their frontline units to attack one frontline unit of the opponent. This skirmish proceeds normally. Each frontline unit may only be chosen as an attacker once per combat, but may be targeted with multiple attacks. Conduct a number of skirmishes equal to the number of frontline units on one side. If a side has no frontline units left, their turn to choose passes and the opponent gets the choice instead.

Still, a very fun engaging game.

Let me just start by saying the game loses an automatic point from me for having 7 broken flying unit bases out of the box.  It would lose two for poorly produced components except they did a fucking marvelous job on the units themselves.  Game wise its a brilliant adaptation of the computer game.  

Off the bat I thought the 3D space mechanics were quite inspired and brilliant.  Even the combat system was well thought out and fairly easy to learn, I love the playing cards out of class and still having a value etc.  Card wise I do feel having 2 face down decks and a hand of cards deck sized laid down leaves room for critical error, especially if you drink and game like I do, its far to easy to pick up the wrong deck instead of your hand, infact this did happen to me.  The game is quite long lasting about 3 hours, it was fairly engaging however, the token placing round system makes things FEEL fairly fast-paced.  The tokens turn orders help make the turns remain interesting and aid in wait times. The basic races are all unique but they do feel a little bland, only the objective comes into play where as the Videogames unique qualities do not, IE sacrificing drones to build buildings, warping in Protoss structures or using more SCVs to build, their all the same at their core.  All and all the special mission objectives won the game for those whom did not engage in the actual major conflict at hand.  I was winning the entire game battling it out against my Protoss enemies, I had a massive lead and was very close to completing my objective.  It seems as if because the other two players turtled they won the game, I'm really not sure how I feel about that since war should be at the heart of the game.

Addendum: after playing twilight imperium, I bitched about a 3 hour playtime on this one, shame on me.

Overall, I think it does a good job of capturing the feel of the computer game. The action chip system really makes the game interesting instead of a simple slugfest that it could devolve in to. It creates a layer in the game of planning out your movements in such a way that you can tie up another player's actions to allow you to build and reinforce your areas before your opponent is allowed to attack you. This adds strategy and tactics to the game and is one of the things that would hold my interest longer that a simpler game would (Risk 2210, Nexus Ops). Also, the research and upgrading fit in well. It doesn't cost a lot to upgrade your buildings, but with limited resources each turn and a small amount of starting units it isn't cheap enough that you would do all research at the  beginning of the game. The game paces it right so that your techs and upgrades aren't all built by the end of the game, this gives some variety to the different games you'll play. It's worth the extended time the game takes.(learning game with 4 players - 3.5 hours)

Really a neat game. There is a lot to it, and like A Game of Thrones, may be better if you are familiar with the material. Regardless, there is a ton of stuff here - modular game board that scales based on the number of players, lots of conflict, technology trees, resource management, unique abilities, unique winning conditions, etc. There are a lot of knocks on this being a long game (it is about an hour a player for new players maybe 45 min if you know what you are doing), but things get a lot faster once people get the swing of the game and become more familiar with the factions abilities.

Without the Broodwar expansion only a 7.

I always liked Starcraft, but i had several disappointments with it.

- Special Victory Condition Victorys  are too  common
- While the factions are balanced, imo, several units are useless, Firebat, Siege Tank. While other are easily the best option for a faction: Archon, Science Vessel 
-No Broodwar units

Brood war solved them. Howevert, there is one reason for me that game is not a 10. It can still easily happen that the both players which are leading can't touch each other.

A lot of people said that this was impossible to play (too complicated), but I'd read the rules, played a turn, read them again, and was ready to teach. Come the day I explained the rules (nigh on 2 hours), and we played - for 8 hours!
We all agreed that it was good and if we were to play again tomorrow, we'd have this down t approx 4 hours, however I'm not sure I want to repeat the pain!
The airborne figures are insanely fragile which is a big annoyance.
On teh positive, the minis are beautiful, the translation from RTS to board is unparalleled, as they've managed to keep the flavour of the races perfectly.
So it is a '7'. Would I want to play it all the time? Clearly not, and if it was a 2 hour game, then I probably would...

RATING: 5
This left me feeling a lot like Age of Mythology did ... that learning the strengths, weaknesses and special abilities of every unit in the game is probably necessary to play StarCraft well, and not something I want to spend the time to do. On the plus side, the action planning mechanic was vaguely reminiscent of the planning mechanic in A Game of Thrones. On the downside, it's implemented much better in A Game of Thrones. As with Age of Mythology, I wanted to like this game, with all its wonderful creature and starship minis, very much. But StarCraft just seems too slow-paced and, as with Age of Mythology, the battles seem to blur together to the point where you stop caring. StarCraft is all about the different units and unit cards, but I guess that just wasn't enough to grab my interest, despite the beautiful bits.

RATING: 9
I appreciate StarCraft more each time I play it.  An innovative design that encourages strong tactical play over long-term strategery.

It reminds me a lot of A Game of Thrones.  The evolved take on the hidden order system is the most obvious link between the two.  Both can also be very unforgiving to minor mistakes, and this game isn't very intuitive so newbie mistakes are to be expected.

One thing I don't like is the wildly imbalanced event cards, though this seems to be less of a problem the more players that are in the game.

It's also disappointing that the games don't seem to have much narrative as I loved the story of the video game's campaign.  But the great figures don't let me forget that I'm definitely playing StarCraft.  (Brood War's scenarios may add the narrative I was missing.)

UPDATE: Played again after a long hiatus.  Raised my rating from a 7.5 to a 9.  Awesome tactical combat game.  Why the hell did I care that there was no narrative?  This isn't capturing the campaign, it's capturing BattleNet.

RATING: 3
This is a marvelous adaptation of the computer game. Even the combat system - which I was afraid to be eceedingly complex like the one in Age of Mythology - suits the game just fine. Despite being a long game (>3 hours), it feels like a fast-paced game, because there is so much action right on from the start. My only concern are the flyer units, they seem to be really fragile. I am happy it doesn't use any real-time mechanics, yet in the way players' orders are resolved you get some of that real-time feeling. I now know what it is that I am missing in this game. It is the uniqueness of each factions' workers. There's no game mechanics that involve warping from the Protoss, Brooding by the Zerg and building and repairing by the Terrans. The workers merely exist to harvest resources. Still, this is a great game. 
--------------------------------
Update: I think I'm through with this game. There's just too much conflict going on. And while I like the card-driven mechanic of combats after two sessions in which I got attacked by everybody ( in a 4- and a 3-player game) I'd almost wish to go back to a pure luck-driven combat. You can hold on to fighting two opponents at the same time for a while but not long if you are the only one that has to cope with two or more opponents. Plus, even though you can draw some satisfaction out of fighting off multiple opponents you cannot improve on your developments or armies as you would want and can do if only having to cope with one enemy commander.And in the end you WILL be overrun, since in the time you were busy fighting off opponents,trying to rebuild your armies,your opponents invested in developments you couldn't invest in, because rebuilding armies is quite expensive itself. Eventually your opponent comes with armytypes and technologies you have nothing to subtend to. 
----------------------------
Yet another session in. And once again it showed that it's not worthwhile with three players. If this were three-player only I'd rate it a 3. The game can however be better with more and even better wih an even amount of players. Hence the 5.5
----------------------------
After the somewhat unfortunate 3player-constellations I have a very strong urge to play this game again with more players involved and with the expansion. 
----------------------------
More players, expansion added, but the result is that with the original ruleset there is still a big chance for very unfortunate and rather fortunate start positions. Maybe playing with the variant of each player drawing and placing three planets there could be some time to breathe and even out early misfortunes, but I'm so done with this game now to find out.

Some flyer units broken off their flight stands, but otherwise in a complete and very good condition. All cards are sleeved. German copy, will only trade with Brood War

Great game, but if you're not playing with people that know Starcraft, it can be daunting.  Really, it's daunting anyway.  The game takes up a LOT of space and it's like playing 3 games of chess at the same time.  However, it has some of the best tension moments I've ever experienced.  There's no luck in this game beyond the initial planet placement and cards you draw.  Base building, combat, order placement, no luck at all, very strategic.  However, this means it can be very long (especially setup).  As of now I've only played twice.  I think it works with 2 player or teams.
I've only played with the Brood War expansion and I think that's for the best.

RATING: 7.5
A very true-to-form translation of the source material.  This has positives and negatives for me.  Positives: LOTS of options for building, research, etc;  Carefully-balanced and very thematic asymmetry; Interesting special victory conditions.  Negatives:  First, Starcraft's absolute disregard for any sense of scale has always seemed sort of strange to me--a battle cruiser just seems like it should be...huger.  In board game terms, it means that the base units just don't seem that much less powerful than the ones at the top of the tech tree.  Second, RTS games focus so heavily on combat that any secondary objectives, irrespective of how important they are to one's ultimate victory, seem always less important than just FIGHTING.  That's not a disadvantage itself, but for me it becomes so when combined with the sense of scale, because it means that players are forced into immediate conflict with one another, and you have to gear up your resources with as much alacrity as possible.  Now, this says more about me than it does an RTS game, but I don't WANT to gear up my resources quickly.  I want to max out all of my tech trees and roll over the opposition with a huge force; there's just not the time to do that in a multiplayer RTS game.  They nailed the computer game experience faithfully enough that I feel the same playing this: too much to do, too little time.  That is a perfectly good board game maxim, but it's one of the things that drives me crazy about RTS games.  So I'm split about this.  Will gladly play it again, and the "system" aspect of these big box games means I'd likely be able to find the perfect balance for my taste if I tinkered with it enough (But somewhere in my brain I'll fantasize about playing a 2P game on an 8-planet board...).

I love the pieces in this game, but i wish FFG would spend less time on bits and more time on testing.  This game has various balance issues with units and special winning conditions.

A remarkably clever tactical/strategic battle game that actually sheds the crutch of dice and involves less luck than you'd think.

As a bonus, plays well with any number of players, including 2; however, game-length scales super-linearly in terms of number of players.

Has a few strategic degeneracies and imbalances, but these are generally much less of a problem than other games of its genre.

RATING: 3.5
First Impression: 
Dissapointing. Three hours and two(!) battles after game start (the victor didn't battle at all), the game suddenly but finally ended.. 

So how did these three hours pass? Battling with the game mainly.. Building workers (ok), Gathering resources (spare me), brainburning for the order turn (ok), brainburning for the unique victory conditions(ok), managing the hand (boring), upgrading (for what?).. Generally doing tons of little interesting things BUT the basics of wargames: fighting and negotiating.

I can't help but feel that they tried too much to improvise, and cut too much of the wargame heart in the process. Not fun for me, even though I love the theme.

RATING: 9
This game is, on the surface, not that complicated.  However, it captures the theme of the computer game so darn well that it's just almost too fun to play.  There are many better games out there - AGOT/TI3 for examples - but this one just captures my attention every time.  The combination of the beautiful parts and the streamlined game mechanics makes for a smooth-playing game that is fun every single time I've played it, no matter how many players there were (2, 3, or 4 so far).  An excellent game, and one I was proud to own until some jerk stole it from me in college.

Loved it after one incomplete play. Seems fairly balanced between the races, the hidden, stacked commands flow smoothly and there is a good amount of screwage. I'll definitely be playing again. I've found after a few plays that the card driven combat system is a little clunky but seems to be reasonably well balanced. The zerg with their ability to produce and expand quickly seem to have a slight edge, but not by much.

Definitely a learning curve on this one!  A little disappointed at my first non-Gen Con play, mainly from our galaxy set-up and the long time it took to explain the game. I'm hoping that after a reread further games will focus on the game and not the rules, and we'll do a better job of setting up a fairer galaxy.

My second game went much better, and I get the feeling that the more I platy the more I'll appreciate the subtleties of this game.  Galaxy set up still plays a huge role, but perhaps that's because of our inexperience.

Great fun; a very meaty strategy game with tons of choices to make every turn involving units, research, and building.  The modular nature of the universe is great, and assures that no two games will be alike.

A good game with lots of moving parts. An enormity of cards, special powers, different units (beautiful miniatures), some light deck-building, and others things are merged in this game.

It has a good deal of interaction, sice there is, usually, dispute for the control of regions. The combat is a really neat part of the game: the units stay in a line, and one at a time they face each other (but some units, with the use of some cards, can affect the units behind the one engaged) - it is in this moment that the choice of cards are important, since you draw then for the combat.

A solid game from the Fantaty Flight machine, but one that, now, is hard to get.

Extremely hard to bring to the table. I love Starcraft universe and this one got it all. 

But there is way to much units to take into account and micromanagement that its hard to understand rules and mostly, bring new or veteran player to play it.

Instead of recreating absolutely all units in the game but no building miniatures, I would have prefer some major units ( ex  Marine, Tank Goliath Wraith Batllecruiser for Terran) and some Building ( CC, Turret, Science Lab.... ). They made bad choice : how come the Overlord units is just a transport chip? Overlord are such an important Zerg trademark as Pylon are for Protoss, I don't why they didn't do anything more interesting about them.

They would have done a much better job if they had done the same as they did with Forbidden Stars (well, Starcraft was the proving ground ....)

Amazing. Feels like GoT in space. Rules are more hard to understand and battlesystem seemed to be especially difficult. You have to know your race and cards in your decks. Rulebook is crappy, it made the game look more heavy that what it actually is.

After one play with four players, I have to conclude that Starcraft is an OK tactical game with some unwieldy components and clunky rules. To sum it up, it is allright but unremarkable. Sure you get a lot of bits for your money, but the usability of some of the counters and boards is questionable at best. Neither are the miniatures of a high standard. My biggest complaint with this game, however, is that I would rather play something more strategic (like Twilight Imperium) if I have to go over such a large amount of rules and have to put with a playing time of several hours. Starcraft may have a reasonable price/bits ratio, but the price is way too high for the amount of fun you get out of it. If your are looking for something similar, buy Dust instead.

This is a really quirky game. There are a lot of individually interesting elements mishmashed together to create a whole that is somewhat bloated, but actually works. It is really hard to defend any one particular area, as the attacker in any given fight has such a big advantage, but the restrictions on planning and attacking make it hard to pull off any great devastation.

This game is about attacking strategically. I love the premise but I'll need to look at some variations. The rules lead to the game ending right when things are just warming up. Is this part of the design or just our not being aggressive enough early on I'm not sure.

A combination of a lot of successful mechanics from other games, Starcraft isn't anything new, and that's it's biggest failing.  Many games, most notably [gameid=12493] and [gameid=72125] cover this type of theme and bits, the order system is very similar to [gameid=6472] or [gameid=22038] with a procedural twist, and the unit upgrade system is directly ripped from [gameid=7479].  The one system that's not derivative is the combat cards and skirmish system, which is unintuitive, awkward, and overly specific.  There's an awful lot of deck- and hand-management in a game which is supposed to be about tactics and resources.  The cards do  enforce the need for mixed forces, but introduce an unsavory element of I have a card/I don't have a card.  

This game is clearly for fans of the video game.  There's tons of non-intuitive chrome that arises from slavish devotion to the computer game, but is not summarized well anywhere in the components.  All of the people in my group who are big fans of the computer game can see past this, and everybody who is unfamiliar with the series or who is only a casual fan finds the skirmish system frustratingly unintuitive.

There's no need to track this down, especially for the prices it's going for now.

StarCraft: The Board Game is an excellent strategic galactic combat game based on the StarCraft PC Game Universe.  Though it shares little mechanics-wise with its PC counterpart, StarCraft The Board Game still feels like the PC game.  Even without the tie-in, it's an excellent game.  See my review.

Battles in this game are too over-complicated, boring and, to be honest, pseudo-intellectual.

RATING: N/A
It feels as it could have greatly benefitted from a severe streamlining. There's just too much stuff to handle for little payoff in gameplay or fun (this is still your average "war with a few different units" game, overcomplicated by ideas like "issue commands in reverse order", "build your tech deck", "resolve combat comparing cards", etc. all of which sound cool or somewhat innovative, but fail to be entertaining or interesting enough to justify their burden).

Awesome strategy game that does a great job portraying the factions you remember from the video game. A few really cool ideas such as adding a third dimension to a 2d board.

I will rate this game: 9. After the first game I am thinking that I should rate it 10, but it was just a first game. But I realy love all things in this game. 

I have played in group of six players, and it was realy awsome. There was no boring at all, the game is constructed in a way that you can't be "alone" there is always someone close to you, who want your resources, points or just crash you so you can't crash him :)

I am realy love it. 

I will probably change my rate after few more plays or leave it like it is now.

EDIT: Ok so I have played few games more. And now I can rate it at 8. I still can say that this is very good game, but there are some things that can have great impact on game. If you are unlucky you can start game without any point on your board. If you are lucky you will get "2 point" planet. This have realy big impact on how games is going on (and who have biggest chance for win).

Three powerful alien races battle for control of the galaxy. Whether you choose to lead the versatile Terran, mysterious Protoss, or voracious Zerg, in StarCraft: The Board Game you'll command an army like no other in the universe!
\13\\13\
Once again, Fantasy Flight Games brings one of the world's best-loved computer games to your tabletop. Players take control of the Protoss, Terran, or Zerg and battle across multiple worlds. True to the StarCraft legacy, each of the three races features a unique and distinctive play style, and the inclusion of two distinct factions for each race allows up to six players to compete for galactic dominance at a time.

RATING: 7
As usual, Corey Konieczka has done a terrific job of translating a popular licensed I.P. into an excellent boardgame. Like Twilight Imperium, this epic game comes with loads of cards, giant piles of awesome plastic miniatures and a ridiculous amount of cardboard. The game plays fairly quickly (once you have the hang of it) and all of the factions and units behave exactly as they should in order to be faithful to the StarCraft universe. The card based combat took a little getting used to, but eventually it flows together rather well. The only difficult thing about the StarCraft boardgame is the way it handles player actions. Everyone places an order token face down and if anyone else plays an order in the same zone they are stacked on top of one another. They are then resolved in order from the top down. Don't get me wrong, this is a really cool system, as it succeeds in giving the whole game a "real time" flavor with all the actions piling up and players trying to react to them...but it does require a ton of concentration. If you accidentally stack your command tokens in the wrong order, there is a very strong possibility that you will not be able to do anything and effectively lose a turn. I've had it happen to me and boy does it suck!

It takes a while to learn the factions and their unique strengths and weaknesses, but once you do the game gets even better. If nothing else, Fantasy Flight did an excellent job of capturing the asymmetrical nature of the StarCraft races. This is a very faithful translation. If you're a Blizzard fan, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.

Update: I am coming back to this entry a few years later and I'd like to point out that Corey Konieczka sort of invented the deck building genre in this game. Combat is resolved through draws from a deck of cards unique to each faction and the deck is improved from turn to turn by adding more powerful cards to the deck after your faction has finished researching the technology that awards them!

RATING: 9
I guess I'll start with what I don't like: the Event cards are so widely varied that, while all are useful in some situations, having the right card at the right time is both impossible to plan for and extraordinarily difficult to defend against, adding a nearly jarring degree of randomness at times. That being said, that is the ONLY thing I don't like. Even the planet setup is engrossing. I love the stack system, the tech tree is inspired, and it does a phenomenal job of capturing the spirit of an RTS in an extremely playable board game. This is worth the price of admission to me.

I can really appreciate the card driven (basically 'deck building') battle mechanic, but the actual battle resolutions take far too long. If this mechanic could be streamlined, the rest of this game is fantastic. It just overstays it's welcome due to the over-long battles.

RATING: 8.4
I just love those big box Ameritrash games with tons of bits.  But this one is great because I liked the original computer game but hate RTS electronic games.  The players are all here, just add conquering.  The combat and battle damage system seems a bit quirky at first but it's innovative and fits in with the game units well.  If you want TI3 without the politics and negotiations, this one's a straight 4E game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Upgraded to a 9 after 4 plays.  The game is amazingly well balanced given its complex nature.  The various units are all very cool and the technology deck (which initially seems a little weak) really begins to get more use as the players get more experience.  Plus the game plays fast once the players all know the rules.  It would not suprise me that a 3 player game takes only 1-1.5 hours in an experienced group.  I look forward to many more plays.

Really topnotch game.  Gives you the flavor and feel of something like TI3 in what should be a fraction of the time.  I suspect that for four players who've played the game before, it is about a 2.5 hour game.  

I've downgraded it a bit over time because during our third game I found we were still doing a couple of things wrong.  While I think the game is really good, there are a fair number of things that just aren't that intuitive.  

More importantly, the board setup needs work.  The bottom line is that this would be a much better game with some sort of agreed upon setup.  After 4 games, I am convinced that I don't want to play this again with the setup process set in the manual.

This game just really didn't do it for me. We were so stoked to play it but it just really fell through for me.

I made some mistakes early on and that took me out of the game. I decided to take another player with me and turned all of my resources towards wiping him out. I couldn't do it. It was way to hard to wipe someone out in this. You just hang around not able to do anything but people can't kill you.

Based on one play. Pretty darn fun, and the actions system is clever, combat is interesting. Would like to play again. Not sure if I will buy it though...

Update - After thinking about the game I played the night before, I went out and bought it. At FULL RETAIL! Played second game with my kids, and they liked it as well. Upped the rating a half point.

Update - Played a two player game for the first time, and it worked pretty well. We had forgotten what "control" meant, so our end game victories kicked in too soon. Holding solid at 7.5 as it's just a quality game. Has a few flaws, yes, but the rock/paper/scissors of the units, combined with the combat system's cards is pretty nifty. I'll play this just about any time. Upping rating another half point to 8

There's a spark of life buried in there somewhere, but it's not worth the effort to coax it to the surface.

I spent nearly our whole game stuck in the same small area of the board - the equivalent of being in a "time out" for bad behavior and never being set free.  

It could be that the game's owner was punishing me for a transgression that was never brought to my attention.  If so, I deeply apologize.  Here, keep your overwrought tech tree and combat system and allow me to go outside and play with my friends.  I'll even clean my room if that will help.

I had this as a 9 but it just hasn't held there.  Beautiful game of space conquest that needs a bit more depth and substance to make it a favourite.  Love the order execution system just wish more variety of units would come into play.  So cramped and tense (no vast galaxy to conquer here) one is hesitant to waste time researching the bigger units.  The battles are card filled fiddly affairs for what amounts to a basic A&A style battle with fewer units.  Give me a dice-based system for battles this simple or make the battle more complex with maneuvers, hit points, and the like.

Lots of options, though for some races different build hierarchies are just alternate ways of doing the same thing.  Aspects from the game translate pretty well but it's hard to get more elegant than real-time. The special victory conditions don't always promote battle (my first game I won without ever fighting, using Jim Raynor's ability and capping large stacks with R+D actions to deplete the Event deck) while initial placement is extremely important. (People who place first can hold off their base, causing people who place later to get caught in the middle of the galaxy. The wormholes sort of alleviate this, but it's a bit of a gamble to wormhole straight to a homeworld and expect to take territory.) Somewhat fun, and very long, but I'd rather play the computer game.

So far I am enjoying this. Ends to quick - I agree with this sentiment expressed by others. We are giving it room as written before we change anything though. 

Update - we have added cards to the deck so that it lasts a bit longer - we like this tweak though I wonder who it really benefit race wise. I think I have won about 50% as Jim... sticking with humans for now. 

Update 2 - we have not played it right once... we have been allowing a player to build more than one base on a planet DOH... one player was taking the opp to cut off entire planets from invasion with the air defense module and multiple bases covering the planet. 

Final Update: lowering my rating. For some reason I am not finding this game all that fun. I do enjoy it but I hesitate to pick it right away when choosing a game. I think that I am not a fan of the combat system though it works. Also - theme is an issue. I guess I'd rather invest the time in a WWII game when wanting battle.

There's so much you WANT to like here.  Cool units, neat ideas, tech trees, interesting theme.

What you get is an overcomplicated mess of a game that clearly underlines the importance of playtesting (or lack thereof). The ruleset is just horrid.  It is overly ambigous and filled with contradictions and exceptions.  Add to that the 60 page rulebook, and you'll find every game, every turn, you'll forget one rule or another.  It's massively complicated. Every rule has another rule that changes the last rule.  The word 'except' and 'however' appear 40 times in the standard rulebook alone.  Add the expansion for more exceptions.

End result is that you dont WIN or LOSE a battle (which is what this game is supposed to be about) due to superior strategy, strength or power, but 8 of 10 times, from another person exploiting a rule you'd forgotten about.  End result frustration, arguing.. eh, yea... fun.

The extremely long playtime and huge downtime add to the pain.  I once played 6 player game at a con with 4 newbies.  We finally quit after 9 hours without declaring a winner. It was common to have 45 minutes to an hour before it got around to your turn again.

The tragic thing is, there's so much potential here that you want to slug through it all and find that buried treasure.  Alas, after a half-dozen plays, I'm conceding that if there's treasure in there, it's bured so deep you'd have to demolish the whole block to get to it.

It need's a eurogamer's touch to completely re-write this thing.  Starcraft's designers seemed to fix rule problems by adding more rules.  Which creates a never ending spiral -> always adding one more rule to fix the last bad one.

Impressed by this epic oldie of the coffin box generation. From the battlecard deckbuilding to the stacking orders mechanic it was a boardgame ahead of its time and still hasn’t been redone by anything else. There’s a thick rulebook but the flow is easy and I felt constantly challenged to develop my strategy over the course of a session. Certainly captures the theme and spirit of Starcraft or RTS boardgame. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You should probably play without the special victory conditions for each race; they make the game end just as it's getting developed.

There's a lot going on here, but it seems like a lot of work for what can be a very coarse set of choices and results; how you do hangs on what feels like too few units, battles, and manoeuvres compared with all the fuss over technology and build-up. The board layout can also really hose you. So in many cases it may feel like you're out of luck fairly early on, and as a result of very few decisions and battles.

06/01/2010 - Mostly a heap of junk, although I recently played a co-op scenario from Brood War that worked well enough to at least make me care how the game turned out.  Overall, however, it's unwieldy, gluttonous and unfun.

Previously - I had the overriding feeling that the number one design objective for Starcraft was to keep it short.  I can appreciate this to some extent, but I don't feel like I've ever played a game where it was quite so obvious, except perhaps with TI3.  The game seemed to cut itself short just as it was gaining momentum.  Anyway, I was pretty flaccid after the first go-around, so I don't expect I'll play this again.

Hard to give a Rating. The sheer size of the game works against it: I find myself getting other games on the table because they are not so much of a hassle.

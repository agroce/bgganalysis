RATING: N/A
May have to recreate this one. Will have to figure out how those old IT combat wheels worked...

RATING: 7
Also if the game is not more young the game is good (as Rules e graphic) and funny ...my personal opinion: the only "problem" is that the knight (if best played) are very strong respect other factions...my opinion...

It was my first boargame, and without this game, I had never discover the Wargames or the RPG ! Well, it was 25 years ago, and now I play ASL.
Good memories of my first days as a wargamer.

I discovered this game long time ago, my favorite IT game of Marco Donadoni. Perharps race monks is a little unbalanced.

A classic, and my first real boardgame. The rules we invented as kids are naturally much better than the real ones. Even if the actual games never come to an end...

I probably haven't played this since my high school years.  Great european production values.  Absolutely beautiful map mounted on extra-thick stock.  Game balance between the four players could probably be improved.  I bet a smart, veteran gamer could do some math and figure out which factions need to lose a few pieces for better balance.

The game that introduced me to boardgaminbg 20+ years ago. Nothing special considering toady&#039;s state of the art, but the rating reflects the fact it was really ahead of its time, as the success of Warangel (inspired to Zargo&#039;s Lords) demonstrates.

Loved this game when I was young (=25 years ago). Never played again ever since. Can't really rate it but I would have probably given it a 9 at that time. I remember playing it with my older brother, while we were listening to Henry Purcell's Funeral for the Queen Mary : the music fitted just perfectly with the theme and there we were in Zargo, far away from our good old world, ready for the battle. The Monks and the Winged were my favourites, while my brother liked the Knights better (yeah, I know, that's why he beat me everytime).
I know I'd better not open the box again or I will be very disappointed (better leave those wonderful memories alone). Thanks International Team anyway. These were good moments and ZL introduced me to the world of (true) gaming.

Never took to this as a game, but the board and components made a superb RPG campaign setting! My set now seriously incomplete as a result.

Flawed rules. Affected by time. Good for collectors, nothing more.

[played twice]

It would be a good game, but, like other '70-'80 games is too long to play. 120 minutes is an optimistic esteem: end a game took at least twice

fond memories played in 1983 @ corvetto Milano.I did not even have the money for the bus (91)...

It was a miracle considering the italian "whole" gaming picture of the 70'es and 80'es.I cannot rate it, it should be 11,15,16 more than 10...

Played this game alot in 80-83.  One of my favorite wargames.  Battle results with rolling chart are a nice feature.  Really wish I could find the expansion pack.

One of my 1st Wargames, Great Graphics and a Mapboard which represents a whole planet - Yiu can leave the board east and enter west... New at that time.

I owned and played it when I was a kid. Later I bought "Blue Stones" which I still have. But I liked "Zargo's Lords better than "Blue Stones".

RATING: 8
The first startegy game I played.
Four fantastic races (six if you bought the expansion) fight for the supremacy.
Nice map and counters.
Pay attention: the expansion gives some new options (e.g. rules to handle magic); these options unbalance the game since the luck factor become too much relevant

Played this at my friend's place a long time ago. He owned the game and liked it a lot (I have to add his uncle is the artist) but I was colder because I wasn't a fantasy fan and the game was way too long (120 minutes is too optimistic, we played all afternoon long). 
Nevertheless a valuable product (like all International Team games), considering when and where it was made.

Simply the first Fantasy Wargame published in Italy.
Great graphic, related to other boardgames available in Italy in that period, it is to be considered a masterpiece.
My Warangel is inspired to this game created by Marco Donadoni, in my personal opinion the first "historical" game designer in Italy. I know several games of International Team, all great products: Zargo's Lords is at the first place.

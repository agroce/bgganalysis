Puzzling game. Seems VERY hard for the Dornkeeper. In the first play, the heroes steamrolled, but Zorkal made some key errors. In the second play, the heroes needed some lucky item draws to win, but also had a pretty suboptimal mix (they were randomly chosen, and we didn't have the mage, the cleric, the paladin, or the swordsman -- so we had no healing other than the werewolf's self-heal and the herbalist/fountains on the board). Both plays took 4+ hours as we did not limit time or analysis. It certainly seems like more time pressure would help Zorkal, but that seems unsatisfying. Either way, our group was looking for a short-playing dungeon crawl, and this game wasn't it.

nice idea, but a bit long, doesn't seem balanced at all (some rules are a bit unclear, but it seems however you resolve them the game will be unbalanced one way or the other.

also, I have huge doubts as to replayability...

RATING: 5
Too much chess and too little heroic fantasy for my tastes. There is only one big luck factor, which appears like a design error - the treasures you find. Some of them help you, others nearly kill you. Since you don't know what you get in advance this becomes a 'press your luck' game (or you just ignore the treasures all together).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is an extremely well designed game but unfortunately under developed (needs more maps and scenarios) and under produced (art is meh and it needs plastic). If a big publisher gave it the correct treatment it would be an absolute winner. 

I would say it plays better than - for instance - Descent (First ed), simply because it is less fiddly, plays quicker and has less downtime. 

The fact that there is no luck involved should get the Euro crowd to cross over!

19/11/2011 Bumped it up from 7 to 8. This game gets better the more you play it - simple rules but deep strategy. Brilliant!

I must say I found this one of the worst dungeon crawl games I've ever played. There is no variaty in monsters or board between plays. Besides that the Dorn keeper seems way too powerfull. So no balance, no replayability and not much fun either.

Dungeon Crawl - euro style. The combat is deterministic - monster spawning, rituals and treasures are random.

It's ok - but I prefer the components in Heroquest, D&D game, Castle Ravenloft. Map is fixed too, which could limit replayability.

Overall, happy to play, no desire to own.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play, this is definitely looking to be my biggest dissapointment of all my Essen 2008 buys. The game looks, feels and handles very different from all the other "dungencrawler games" - to say the least. It's dungencrawl without dice and with an effektive old school look stillWhich is not bad, and actually what I was looking for - I thought. Only problem is that it plays very dull. Since there is very little luck and that you can actually plan several turns ahead, everyone ends up cuonting steps, planning, calculation immensly, which drains most of the excitement. It IS chess - with a bit of luck and monsters throw in. For 6 people! And in a way it is not. Because unlike chess, there seems to be only 1 or 2 winning strategies - and when you find these, you just stick with them. So ultimately it ends up being its own worst enemy - trying to be two things and ending up taking the worst of each. I'll give it a few more tries, but I doubt that it will ever rise beyond a 7 in grade.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like the concept, but the game plays much too slowly for my taste and it is difficult for the Dornkeeper player to win unless the heroes do something foolish (like divide up).  I can see where the game would be appealing to other people, but I prefer more random combat.

When I read the rulebook and saw the components, I was afraid that the game was too simple, dry, deterministic, chess-like. I'm happy to find out that was wrong. Although the battle was deterministic, the game was full of theme. The hero, the monsters, all have their own twist and flavor. What a beautiful gameplay.

The only downside is the system is 1 vs many. System that I care less than even from co-op

Very cool dungeon crawling. The best part of it, for me, is that it is diceless. So you have to make some good decisions and tactics in combat. 
There is a gamemaster against the heroes and there is all the good fantasy stuff: monsters, treasures and artifacts.

Cooperative, one against many dungeon crawl game.  Good guys are trying to collect three artificats that will allow access to the bad guy.  Bad guy is trying to either kill the good guys, or fill a chamber with monsters.  Very clean playing game, moves along quickly, great bits, easy rules, and diceless combat system.  Had a great time with this, even though I was totally thrashed.  Looking fowards to exploring this one further.  Worry is that it may get solved, but that may take several plays.

It really drips with theme and strangely enough I do like the art that comes with the game. A dark fantasy, grim, where the adventurers face an implacable foe.

This is Ameritrash for gourmets: "Hero Quest on steroids blended with Chess".

Dorn is a cooperational game in which everyone plays versus a "gamemaster" (the Dornkeeper). Beating the Dornkeeper is more challenging and less chaotic than beating the Artificial Intelligences of conventional cooperational games.

The game is diceless, most things are deterministic, with some hidden cards as the only random element. There's sometimes Analisys-Paralisys, but otherwise game flows very fast. The battle mechanics have been built in squad-level, not in character-level: as in Chess, it's very easy to explain how the individual pieces work, but on the board, the game gets very deep!

Individual movements can be optimized, but everyone has to make strategic choices and you have to play intuitively, just as in dice-heavy games. Mechanics will appeal to Eurogamers, and theme and gameplay will be the dream of RPGish Ameritrashers.

UPDATE: The replayability of this game is limited, and I have played so many times that I burned it already! I'm waiting for a expansion.

UPDATE: The Koschei expansion is a must! Keeps the game fresh enough and brings more variety.

Awesome.  This is the game I've been looking for.  I prefer this to Runebound, Prophecy, Tannhauser, Doom, Heroquest, etc.

Very good 2 player.

If you like squad-based tactical games then this is probably for you.  These mechanics are boilerplate military combat game mechanics.  Only problem is that if you like that sort of thing, you probably already play real wargames and have already passed over this game because of the theme.  Anyway, I don't know how to win this game as the Dorn Keeper.  If the party has a healer, it is nigh impossible to wear down the heroes.  Try to stockpile your monsters and they get fireballed by the mage (oh, and no matter what the heroes will level up the mage by plinking the starting monsters--you can't save them!).  Like I said, I have no idea how you are supposed to win this game other than to play against incompetent idiots.  It's a shame because playing the heroes is completely uninteresting to me.  But playing the Dorn Keeper is an exercise in futility.

I have played the vanila and the expansion.  No meaningful difference to me.

RATING: 7
A curious dungeon crawler. Its main specific feature is that combat is 100% deterministic. One attack = One point of damage. Heroes and certain monsters block the first attack which is aimed to them each turn, and subsequent attacks inflict wounds. Another nice, thematic point is that wounds inflicted to a hero go to the "blood drops pool" of the overlord, enabling him to gain levels or to play powerful, game-changing rituals. 

Both heroes and the overlord begin at level 1, and can earn up to 2 more levels along the game. A hero gains a level by of killing a predetermined amount of monsters, while the overlord can do it by means of spending some amount of "blood drops".

On the drawbacks: 

-The map is essentially always the same (with two minor modifications randomized each game which do not significantly alter the strategy of either side). 

-It has player elimination: Once a hero losses its last hit point, he is dead. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that there are always 5 heroes in play, so if there are less players than heroes the first deaths do not push anyone out of the game.

-The replayability seems reduced: although there are tons of heroes, the strategy of the hero team is limited: with certain exceptions, splitting is almost never a good choice, as it allows the overlord to focus on one of the hero teams, kill them and use their blood to become too powerful for the rest of heroes. As a result, the general approach for both sides ends up being basically the same after some plays: the heroes advance slowly and steadily as a group, while the overlord gets more and more monsters and avoids attacking the heroes, as, at the beginning of the game, if they fight together they are a far too strong force for him. Then, the game boils down to a cold war until the two forces collide.
 
All in all, Dorn is a light, fast (45' to 90'), modest and really enjoyable game with some great features unique in the current dungeon crawler offer. Moreover its price -when it was available- is not steep at all. Highly advisable, even if the replayability is not its strongest point, it can easily provide several fun gaming nights.

Semi-cooperative, chess-like fantasy adventure: The heroes have to collect three of six artifacts to open the gates of Inner Insanctum and defeat the evil overlord.
Reduced role of chance is compensated for by many -MANY!- degrees of freedom. Here's enough room for both strategy and tactics, however, this inevitably means that the newbies will be stunned.

An ultra-light spin on the Descent model of Overlord v. Team dungeon crawl.  There appears to be a decent amount of tactical and strategic decision making for both sides, and the character leveling is easy and fun to strive for.

A great game indeed. At first i was interested from the BGG. But surely when i see the picture of the board on BGG, some of my interest just lost it's appetite. And recently one of my friends bought it and we played it twice. The first impression was out of the game (it sucks) why? cause the game components quality were so low... the board, the monster tokens, the player markers and else. SO lame right? well, don't blame me, i'm the kind of player who thinks highly of visual aspect.
But, after my first play experience, to my surprise it was superb. A dungeon crawling RPG that's way more better than Ravenloft, which Ravenloft only superior in the artworks and components quality.
The heroes are so many, the skill and levels are various. And the game is so balance...

[b]THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE DORN:[/b]

1. Fantastic board depicting (to my mind) the holy grail of dungeon questing maps: the faux medieval "start" village; surrounding treacherous countryside; and the huge, sprawling dungeon complex - all on the same board. You're exploring a world, for a change, rather than just one big super-complex of flagstones and iron-bound doors. The gameboard also depicts nice little touches and flourishes - that enhance it no end - like streams connecting to the sewers, magic fountains, and cavernous entrance chambers (BTW, beware the Dale of Doom in the bottom left hand side of the Black Moor - it's a death trap!).
2. Old-school, dungeon-bashing art on the character boards, which brings back fond memories of Liz Danforth's T&T illustrations.
3. A large and varied mix of player characters, each with distinct skills.
4. No dice. Deterministic combat in a D&D setting; who thought this up? It works very well, though.
5. Simple but effective componentry.
6. Great theme. Even if it's the same old sub-LoTR universe we've all grown up with.
7. Plays well with 2, and doesn't feel too confrontational.
8. The selection of skills available to the heroes, forces the players to work as a team, or maybe 2 teams. I believe that 5 heroes doing their own thing, will ultimately be butchered in that deep, dark dungeon of Dorn.
9. Scope for strategies to to be constructed, and plenty of tactical choices to be made.
10. All of the player characters seem fun to play - including Zorkal.
11. Swift game. About 90 mins.
12. The game is mixed up each time, to avoid set plays, by adding the random "blessings", the Dornkeeper's dark rituals, selecting different characters, ommiting one ancient artifact, and also sealing off tunnels with cave-ins.
13. Appears well-balanced and playtested. Our games are 50% to the Dornkeeper thus far.
14. Simple system.
15. Similar to Heroquest and its ilk, but superior - the game certainly slays Descent.
16. Positioning your forces is hugely important, and this is overlooked in many dungeon siege games. Your paladin can hold off a horde of skeletons in a rough, axe-hewn tunnel, compared to battling in a vaulted summoning chamber. Also, the order and formation of your party mimics the plans you form in dungeon RPG settings.
17. The evil player gets an actual avatar, unlike Descent, and WHQuest, etc, which is a heck of a lot more fun. Who doesn't want to have an actual evil overlord figure on the board, rather than fighting against a "tendrils of evil" type DM, who throws more minions at the party? It just makes playing the bad guy, a little bit more theatrical.
18. On reading the rules, you may be forgiven for deducing that the game's a bit dry, but we have not found that it plays that way; although, obviously, this is a matter of personal taste. When I play, I tend to semi-describe everybody's turns in a quick RPG style anyhow. For shits and giggles. Old D&D habits die very hard.

[b]THE EVIL OVERLORD:[/b]

1. No dice! This may bother hardcore dungeon-bashers. It doesn't bother me, however.
2. Possibility exists for some players to be temporarily overcome by analysis paralysis.
3. Some suspect artwork. The ghosts are Casper no less!
4. Why does the bog beast have a question mark on his face? To incite this very question, I wonder.
5. A few bothersome rules phrasing, due to language conversion I imagine, but nothing that can't be figured out with a cool head.
6. Some crappy name giving: Dorn? Fairy dust skill? The mummies' gaze should be a petrifying touch, I think.
7. The treasure cards miss a trick: why no traps?
8. No traps! It's all fiends versus heroes. I want a spike trap or some bloody infernal contraption that all decent dungeon masters usually have at their hellish disposal.
9. No giant spiders!

I own the 1st Expansion.

Dungeon crawling without the dice rolling.  Dorn is a lite co-op fantasy game in which the players pit against the keeper who spawns monsters to try to thwart their effort.  Very simplified character progression/skill, combat, itemization, as well as events lead one to believe that the game should be fairly fast to play.  However, due to the fact that the Dorn keeper often has around 5-10 minions he needs to move and keep track of each round, do not let inexperienced or AP-proned individual play that role.  Otherwise the game would overstay its welcome very quickly.

I'd recommend Dorn for those looking for games like Descent or Prophecy but without the hassle.

Much more to the game than the simple rules would imply.  This diceless game is all about positioning your monsters and heroes to cause the most damage.  If you enjoy the "mathy" strategy of 1st edition Descent, you may want to check this out.

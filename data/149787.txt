Played the first level 2 times. Our group succeeded the first time, but the second time we stopped playing because it was taking too long and the wounds were piling up. This game really is unforgiving. I hope it will play faster once all the rules are clear and we don't have to stop to check the rule book. Maybe I should have played some solo games first to learn the rules and avoid useless time consuming discussions.

It is so different from any other dungeon crawler I've played, the first one that requires discussing tactics BEFORE entering and after every turn. This too makes the game slower, but players are more involved in the discussion. Compared to PM, descent is a walk in the park. Even if you lose, you just don't get the good stuff. PM adds some bad stuff on top (wounds).
I will probably revise my rating after a few more games.

We started a campaign of this game and still lack of playing the last scenario, but it is too difficult for the rating to change. I understand the idea of this game to be difficult and the characters be more and more destroyed over time 'till they die and have to be replaced. This is not a problem for me, but there are so many bad design choices here that I'm unable to defend this game anymore.

It started on the first scenario, we had a lot of rounds that we felt like doing nothing at all, because the corridor was so narrow and the miniatures stoped the LOS, so the flow of this game is been very compromised from the first scenario to the last we played.

We had some fun in the second and the 5th scenarios, but there are some stupid requirements that we started to be bothered at. But all just fall apart when we tried to do the 6th scenario, it is stupid and almost impossible, that this is not fun at all. The impression I have is that the scenarios are very poor balanced and more than that, there are erratas everywhere.

One of the most stupid features of this game is the summoner, it is a crap monster very poorly designed that is just not fun at all.

The only thing I enjoyed in this game is the Rondel system, I would do some adjustments on this and publish a better game if I could, I enjoy playing a game like this that does not need dices for doing what you want.

But overall, it is one of the most disappointments

RATING: 9.5
Interesting concept of rondel action and card play with a twist of deckbuilding and deck destruction. Feels very fresh. Could have been a bit more polished though.

But man - it feels so fresh and innovative. I am glad that KS Made this game possible. Cannot wait for Future additions to this game.

It is brutal , very cooperative and I really love the inverted Progression idea, that the heroes begin their adventure in their strongest state only to become weaker and weaker. The wound System is amazing. 

So many clever ideas. Love them.

But some Monster movements feel a bit clunky to me, depending from the map and situation.

As well a few rules and passages in the rules could have been clearer. For example the way treasures are handled by the different traders are not that well explained.

But for me: PM:AR is the biggest suprise in 2016 so far and my favourite game of the year.

Very odd blend of heavier contemporary Euro (rondel, diceless, efficiency) and traditional dungeon crawler.

The situation on the table is that of standard fare, run through an underground tunnel and kill stuff to take their treasure. However, the real fascinating element of this game is combining hand management with an action rondel.

You move your character's piece along the action spokes and then may perform the action you land on. There is much coordination with your teammates here as you hop other players and spaces on each action is limited. Teamwork is huge and a big part of the game.

Instead of rolling dice you power actions with numerical cards from your hand. Each character is asymmetric and you additionally have some abilities codified on your cards.

This double layer of filtering what you want to do through your hand and the rondel makes for a puzzle-y system that is most reminiscent of the modern classic Mage Knight. It feels very similar in thought process, although the game here has a stronger tie to narrative and more dramatic elements. 

There is some random chance through card draws for enemy defense. The enemy AI is also controlled via a separate rondel and their action token moves erratically, adding more suspense and tension. You have an idea of where it could possibly land but it's not precise. These elements of uncertainty are paramount in achieving excitement.

The narrative is strong because each scenario has a greater story context which is actually a step beyond something like Descent,  but also because of little touches. I love the fact that wounds are given a name (such as amputated limb and missing digit). These little nods to story keep me grounded and are necessary when so much of the focus of the game is off-board and on the rondel. 

The game does suffer from being a bit messy. It's rough around the edges and devoid of streamlining. There are a great deal of exceptions and special cases and it's a beast to learn. It's the type of game I'd dread coming back to after not playing it for five months.

The flaws are there, but the brilliance is too. You have to want to come for that unique action system and the cognitive challenge. This is very much a game about overcoming obstacles and scraping by just barely. It's not at all about spoon-feeding you glory or empowering you with tons of over the top actions. It wants to kick you in the junk and have you throw a jab back in its face. Are you up for that challenge?

To say I didn't bond with this game is an understatement. It feels like such a back-step from "Gloomhaven." In particular, I loathe the punitive nature of the wounds system. "Gloomhaven" encourages you to put yourself in harm's way for the good of your party members because wounds aren't particularly awful - you either deflect the damage by discarding cards or else you subtract the damage from your HP pool. Done. Not so in "Perdition's Mouth," where every hit against you adds a wound card to the top of your deck, guaranteeing that your next pull will result in a card that can only work against you. And those wounds carry over from mission to mission! So whereas I might want to risk myself for my friends in "Gloomhaven," here I'm afraid to because I don't want my deck littered with with difficult-to-remove wound cards. In essence, the game is discouraging you from being heroic. That's not to my taste at all.

Idea:
Party controlled by players descend into cultists temple and stop them from summoning a demon.

Mechanism:
Co-op game, player actions chosen on a rondel thus you cant do same all the time. You have limited hand of cards to improve your actions. No player acts as game-master, all opponents move according to set rules.

to whom:
If you like strategy (not heavy) and co-op playing, best if you don't move as a party too much as co-ops usually. Each dungeon level is separate thus you can split your dungeon crawl to multiple sessions.

Initially a 9.
After Mission 3: a 5

There are good mechanics, rondell is nice. But the rules are overloaded. The rulebook is very bad, you have to constantly search specific rules while playing. The AI is terrible, really terrible! It takes too much time to play as AI, to look what happens next. The real playtime is low, the administration and checking rules takes too much time. We played Mission 3 with 2 players in 4,5 hours. And we quitted play, cause there was no real threat, but we had to do one more hour to end the scenario.

I am not sure if play again.

Edit: Not playing again. Game sold. Loses against Gloomhaven.

Good euro dungeon crawl. A dungeon crawl about making decisions instead of rolling the dice. Each scenario is a little too long and feels a bit like a slog toward the end.

Unfortunately, it seems like the rule book and scenarios should have gotten one more round of editing and proof reading. Some important rules are hard to find and a bit unclear.

The rulebook is very good but a bit poorly set-out.

Very interesting rondel mechanic with balancing actions you take against spending action points. Creates a very puzzle-like game with an organic fatigue mechanic (spending more action points to continue attacking turn after turn). 

Maybe has one too many mechanisms to be truly great (hand management with rondel management with combat positioning with wound management with life/risk management) but am looking forward to exploring more.

RATING: 8.8
Missed the KS but bought the Gamers Bundle and extras just before Essen 2016. Trait deck was missing but sent with no problems. The resin miniatures are all too easily broken (I broke 3 in the first week). The portcullises are laughably too small but there are other games i own which provide a more realistic substitute (same goes for the doors and chests but I didn't buy the official versions of them).

Rating is based on initial plays (8.8) - rating may have been higher but Rules and Errata are a bit of a mixed bag.

The rating may very well increase on further plays since this is a very tough puzzle of a dungeon crawl which plays well solo. The complexity and difficulty means that large groups of players who are not familiar with the system will struggle, but 2 or 3 may be OK.

Thoughts about Perdition’s Mouth

Can you hear it?
No?
Listen beyond the words.
Listen beyond the cheering of the birds and of the little children.
Listen beyond the words of your beloved ones.
Listen beyond the mumbling of the honoured elderly.
Listen beyond the whisperings of the ancestor skulls swinging in their net of woven grass.
Can you hear the grinding?
Time herself grinds mountains to dust, swords to rust and flesh to ash.
She uses two heavy millstones.
The first is known by name Stone of Destiny.
The second is feared and blamed Enemy Watchstone.

And guess what? You get hold of both if you buy Perdition’s Mouth: Abyssal Rift.

Rest assured, they will not grind your very flesh and bones to dust the first time you play the game.
But you must grind every single grain of the carefully crafted rule set that is woven into every inch of the artwork, design and flavour text down to fine flour, and then you smell the presence of another world. Then you realise that the game is a call to you to come, sit down and share a tale like it is good tradition in all cultures of hunters and gatherers. 
It tells the old story of the fight against the darkness from below. 
When the tale unfolds before your very eyes on your gaming table, you realise that you do not play a game on the lavishly illustrated boards. You look down and see your hands grinding the Stone of Destiny against the Enemy Watchstone. From there, the rules, the gameplay flow smoothly like fine dust down the campaign you are now ready to begin.

I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys immersive stories, detailed but neat rules and a production value of the highest standards. 

But be aware: This game does not play like your everyday dungeon crawler. It is something quite new, it seems familiar but it hides a bottomless depth in its very core. 

Do you dare to go there?

*準備敵人命運石轉盤，兩個敵人標記都放在有血色的該格，威脅指針轉到起始格，一次性遊戲時調整到等同英雄數+1格，戰役模式使用劇本數字加英雄數，再根據紀錄表每消滅一個蟲巢或異教徒警報+1，每死一個英雄或棄掉一個特殊寶藏減1，保留所有加到英雄牌庫的牌跟寶藏還有反應牌庫的牌
*選擇英雄，拿對應圖表模型標記，標示起始血量跟之後的行動，還有英雄卡12張，把英雄插條放到命運石轉盤上，起始隨意玩家順序，照順位放置在移動格的第一格，第二位英雄的放在特殊格的第一格，之後順時鐘放不同區的第一格，插條尖端指向外面，每個英雄在各自牌庫洗勻抽對應英雄表的張數(之後抽牌如果超過手牌上限要棄掉抽的牌)
*遊戲在英雄從出口逃離後勝利，不同劇本可能會有額外條件
>對角不算相鄰，但是算攻擊距離時對角算一格，移動不能對角，每格只能一個模型
>使用完的牌棄掉，開著棄，只有第一張可以看到，休息行動才能將棄牌洗回，對應符號的牌可在做特定行動時出來增強，特殊行動的加強如果是紅色數字不能超過6，可一次出多張，有反應標記的抽反應牌庫來增強，所有卡(受傷卡除外)可當做任意強化一點使用，行動前可使用移動增強卡來順時鐘移動轉盤上插條幾格改變你的行動，也可出卡幫助隊友加數字(能力不行)，但距離超過一格後每格-1，不能超過六格，休息中也不能幫助隊友，牆壁跟關閉的門也會阻擋幫助但不需要視線
>每次受傷扣一滴並拿一張傷害卡蓋著放到你的牌庫頂，使用後仍然丟到自己棄牌堆，只能靠治療行動棄掉，會帶到下個場景，用來幫助別人時要多出牌使總值大於0，傷害卡不能用來加強群體效果，手牌如果有兩張感染卡直接死亡，模型移除放保留區內最大的蟲進場
*遊戲進行數輪直到所有腳色逃離或是死亡，或是完成目標，每個回合分成英雄階段跟敵人階段
A 英雄階段 順位自由決定，每個英雄回合有五個階段
1.根據你的對應血量的最右邊數值獲得對應的行動點，可出加強移動牌增加點數(可被隊友幫助)
2.使用此數值在轉盤上移動你的插條對應格，至少一格，並執行停下該格的行動，每跨過一區花一點，該區滿時跨過不花點，剩餘點數可加強效果(有圓圈的數值加強每兩點加一)
3.執行行動，可出卡增強能力，隊友可幫助
4.結算效果，有些行動要抽反應牌結算時，如果是增強敵人的效果要直接結算不能再出牌，但如果是增強自己的可以在之後出牌
>移動+抽牌   可抽一張牌並使用剩餘點數移動
>特殊+移動 可使用英雄特殊能力(移動前後)，之後可使用剩餘點數移動，但是花費兩倍，也可出對應特殊能力的卡片
>攻擊+抽牌 可抽一張牌，之後使用點數增強攻擊力攻擊，每兩點+1
>移動+反應  使用剩餘點數移動，抽一張反應卡上面數字增加移動
>抽牌防禦抽卡  可抽一張卡，剩餘點數每兩點拿一個防禦標記，被攻擊時防禦+1，下回合開始前棄掉，被攻擊時也抽反應卡增加防禦
>移動+攻擊 先用剩餘點數移動，在攻擊
>休息 將棄牌洗勻進牌庫，抽牌直到符合起始手牌數，此回合不能幫助隊友，在特定地點(床墊)時可回一血
>瞄準攻擊/重擊  根據英雄類型使用不同效果，瞄準射擊為攻擊且+1，之後移動一格不管地形，重擊則攻擊前抽反應卡增強，如果目標存活則往後推一格，之後你往前一格(可對角)，目標如果撞到特定地形則直接做地形效果懲罰
*****移動相關****
*移動前所有幫助跟加強卡要出完，多數物品跟模型腳色都會阻礙移動，除了陷阱門，死亡英雄模型不會，起始要花一點移動到版圖起點，當走到地圖出口格時移除插條跟模型，從敵人鄰近八格內移動額外花一點，開關門，使用開關控制閘門，把寶藏給相鄰隊友，從死亡英雄拿裝備，都花一點，解鎖時宣告你要花的點數可加強，然後抽兩張反應卡結算，大於才成功，如果是開寶箱抽一張寶藏卡後移除
*不同地形差別有，進去要花額外點數，可能會阻擋視線(不能攻擊)，事件可能會結束移動或掉血，當進入此地形時，相鄰八格有一個敵人就抽一張反應卡，如果上面有紅眼符號就結算事件，有些地形只有被推擠到才會直接結算
*傳送時不被任何物品阻擋，沒有地形懲罰，只結算終點地點事件，多餘點數不能用於其他移動行動
****攻擊相關****
*攻擊時要有視線，上限六，閘門/死亡英雄/開關/寶藏/陷阱門/石頭/水不遮蔽視線，如果經過隙縫則從該點為起點判斷視線(兩個邊角物品會遮蔽視線)，攻擊時先決定是否出牌增強，包含隊友，之後抽一張反應牌增加怪物防禦力(此時不能再出牌)，攻擊數值大於防禦力則成功造成一點傷害，可攻擊蟲巢，消滅後移除放一個亂石地形，威脅標記上升一，如果要打爆鎖，為每個鎖抽兩張反應卡結算(閘門三張)
*範圍攻擊時每個目標分別抽反應牌結算，增強出牌時效果可對所有目標或指定單一，不能使用傷害卡減弱，可能會破壞門，打破寶箱沒英雄時寶藏失去，一格內有則抽寶藏卡
*三角範圍攻擊呈現三角形往外擴充，不被敵人阻擋視線
*疲憊標記拿到後只有特殊狀態會棄掉，每次降低你一點行動點，不能低於3
5.行動結束把你的插條尖端轉向裡面代表結束，所有玩家結束時在一起轉到外面
B 敵人階段 所有英雄行動完後執行
1.抽反應卡一張，如果有眼標記，選兩隻保留區的怪移動到第一跟第二生怪區各一，沒有就不移

Nice take on dungeon crawling. Instead of having usual move x2, move+attack, ,attack x2 it has rondel mechanic plus personal deck of cards with action point values or special actions. Full co-op works very well, since no one can delegate other player moves (due personal hand of cards).

RATING: 6
Feels a little gamey at times due to the rondel intentionally restricting your choices. Lack of variety such as non-existent character progression and very limited skills makes this drier than i wanted. Nevertheless, very daring in mechanics and thematic despite my annoyance at the fascination towards Lovecraft.

RATING: 9
A mighty interesting dungeon crawl, both challenging and a quite different. Game mechanicswise, I'd like to mention give my approval to the following:

-Rondel and the hero specific skill decks guarantee that you've got interesting choices that matter to make on every single turn.

-Skill decks and response deck are used for resolving how actions work out. The skill cards are your resources which you use for controlling how far you can move and or how likely you are the hit or defend. 100% chance for succeeding is doable, but that demands burning cards, so you may want to push your luck more often than not. And the response card deck takes care of the random number generation and offers interesting depth for calculating odds as opposed to using dice.

-Each hero offers to the party their own bag of tricks, which is nothing new. What's new though is how each of them are individually hindered significally by their weaknesses but together they are not so much capable of beating the enemies to a pulp, but rather capable of outmanoeuvring them and as a result, beating them to a pulp. Simply smashing a set of numbers against another set of numbers just doesn't work as the heroes tire and the time is on the enemy side.

-Balancing is a bit weird and less obvious, but essentially more heroes doesn't necessarily mean more or stronger enemies, but the movement space gets a little crowded. The "pool of options" where the actions are chosen is finite and your allies are every bit of an obstacle for you as they are your friend. Basically, to remain efficient as more heroes are in play, the more eleborate your dance choregraphy in the tight dungeon corridors needs to be.

-Progression is very funky. Let's say, that you beat a level. An average dungeon crawl would give you power and the enemies would as well gain more power. Essentially, plus minus zero, or in other words, not much changed overall. In Perdition's Mouth, you've not only got loot and hero power ups in form of permanent skill deck buffs, but there's also negative progression that predominantly manifests as crazily thematic wound cards. Together, it's not only enough to get to the end of a scenario but you also need to think how you can beat the scenarios so that your heros won't succumb to their wounds in the long run...

-... or in the short run if you let the AI controlled enemies outmaneuvre you or start too many fair fights with them. Speaking of the AI, it's not the smartest nor is it particularly unpredictable. But that's good, as the player's ability to read and manipulate the enemy is just about the only edge the more flexible heroes have over them.

-You are not stuck with one hero and it is actually quite recommended to switch the party size and composition for maximal synergy and different approaches to the scenarios. So you are quite free to experiment and experience multiple heroes as you please.

-Epic campaign format. Period. This means that you can (but don't have to) play the Perdition's Mouth as a campaign that's made of campaigns. At the time this was written, there was 3 campaigns available and 2 more in active development.

-There's quite a few rule variants you can use to tinker the game to your game group's taste from multiple angles. The adventurer variants can be used to ease the difficulty and make the game more suitable for younger or less hardcore gamers. And the hard variants can be used for satisfying even the most masochistic gamer's cardboard self-flagellation needs. The response deck can also be modified to control the variance. This doesn't necessarily make the game easier or harder, but it does have an effect on how random the game is. Or you can just use the standard ruleset.



Overall, I think this a very cool and smart game. It works great for soloing as well. However, if you're looking for a dungeon crawl that spoonfeeds progression and works almost as a beer and pretzels game, this is not that game. It's also good to notice that playing with more heroes demands more of focus. So if you've got a big regular board game group, everybody needs to sleep well for ensuring adequeate cohesion for not having a clumsy 6-player toe-stomping fest in your hands.

In Perdition's Mouth: Abyssal Rift (PM:AR) you take a bunch of unlikely heroes on a quest to save the world. An evil cult is trying to free an Insectoid demon and worship it as a god. Wait! Before you stop reading...  This is not just another bland dungeon-crawler. Yes, PM:AR is special! The heroes are a tormented and traumatized bunch of outcasts and misfits, not happy heroes. And, more importantly, the game uses cards instead of dice! PM:AR features strategic euro-game mechanisms to power this new and exciting dungeon-crawler.

English language
Here on Ameritrash.nl we like our dungeon-crawlers. When a game allows us to mentally transpose ourselves to a fantasy dungeon, we are happy. For example, I really like Descent: Journey's in the Dark (mostly first edition), but I also enjoy Imperial Assault, Myth (yes.., I know), Shadows of Brimstone and Conan. It’s an exciting time for Ameritrashy dungeon-crawls.

PM:AR is an interesting game, as it's a purely cooperative, fantasy-horror dungeon-crawler BUT without dice. No overlord. It uses cards and a rondel. What is a rondel you say? A rondel is a mechanism mostly found in German-style euro games by Mac Gerdts. A rondel is an action-selection wheel, which strength is forcing the players to trade between the optimal actions and the costs to execute the action in movement across the rondel. Also, once a space on the rondel is fully occupied, other players cannot take that space's action. The rondel means that you really need to coordinate and plan your turn with those of your allies. 
Aim of the Game
The game comes with a campaign of strung together levels, but also allows you to play separate games.  If you play PM:AR as a campaign, you keep score of the events as you move from level to level through the dungeons. Wounds received and victims rescued by the heroes influence the different Heroes. In case of hero death, you can choose to restart the scenario, or keep on going without the deceased hero. In sum, the heroes don't really get stronger during the campaign, if anything, they get weaker, more hurt. A very interesting twist!
While the campaign is an interesting way to play the game, the individual levels do not necessarily hinge on each other and therefore are fine to play one-shot adventures. Each level features specific goals you need to accomplish in order to complete the level. In most levels, the heroes just move from the entrance towards the exit, but the goals can change drastically between levels.
Setup
Setup is easy and fast, independent on you playing separate levels or a campaign game. The map is a single board, and therefore does not have to be put together. This is in stark contrast to what we typically see in similar dungeon-crawlers. 
 
An example map. The map comes with two sets of letters (top to bottom, left to right) to determine the locations of enemies. 

To make setup even easier, each level comes with its own setup-sheet. The setup-sheet lists the goals of the level and the locations of monsters and other important features. In the uncommon case that the level has enemies that do not start at a specific location, the rulebook provides guidelines on how to place them on the board. The setup-sheet also details the number of enemy figures in each of the spawn pools, to be placed or manipulated when the called for.  How enemies spawn will be detailed in a later section of our overview.
At the start of the level, you determine which of the group of Heroes will attempt the level. Each Hero has their own figure, stats-sheet and deck with action cards. Each Hero also has a peg for the rondel, and a marker to keep track of the wounds they’ve suffered. 
Besides the map and heroes, you need to place the two provided rondels on your table. One of them is the "Rock of Destiny", the rondel for the heroes. This rondel consists of 8 sections, each of which corresponds to an action the heroes can take. Each section also features several peg-holes where hero pegs can be placed to indicate you have selected that action for that hero. As part of setup, a randomly chosen Hero starts with their peg in the Move-spot on the “Rock of Destiny”, and each subsequent Hero is placed in a subsequent segment.
The other rondel is the "Enemy Watchstone". While this is no true rondel, it determines the actions the enemies of the game take. The Enemy marker is placed on the start segment of the “Enemy Watchstone”. Depending on the number of heroes and their progression through the campaign (if any), the starting-threat level is determined. 

Lastly, the response, treasure, wound and victim decks are shuffled. The response deck is a deck with numbered cards. The response deck is used to simulate random, but predictable factors in PM:AR.  Wound cards are negative effects suffered by heroes as they take damage. The victim hero-cards are obtained when the heroes rescue victims, symbolizing them helping out. In contrast, response-deck victim cards are negative effects suffered when not rescuing victims from the cult, increasing the Cult’s power. More on the function of these decks of cards will follow in the gameplay overview.

Gameplay overview:
PM:AR plays over a series of rounds until the objectives of the level are reached, or all Heroes are eliminated. A round consists of two different parts. One part is the Hero-phase, in which all the heroes take their turns. After all Heroes have had a go, the enemies of the game activate. During enemy activation, they can spawn, move and/or attack. 

A Hero turn looks as follows:
1.	Get Action Points
Each Hero receives the Action Points (APs), dependent on their health as marked on their Hero-sheet. These APs can be used to move the Hero’s peg on the “Rock of Destiny” or to increase the power of Actions. 
 
An example Hero sheet. Underneath the picture of the Hero, you see the amount of action points (7), the range of which the Hero can attack (1-6) and the Hero’s hit points (2). Next to these values, the attack and defense properties of the Hero are listed. Next to the Hero picture, the special ability of the Hero is listed. In case of Simma, his special ability is to banish. You can activate the special ability when you move your Hero peg into the Special segment on the “Rock of Destiny”.
 
2.	Move the Hero marker on the Rock of Destiny
There are 8 segments on the “Rock of Destiny”, each corresponding to different (combinations of) Actions. For each AP you spend, you may move your Hero-peg 1 segment on the “Rock of Destiny”. The more AP you pay, the further you can move. Many of the segments can be occupied by multiple heroes at the same time. If however, all peg-holes on the wheel are filled, you cannot take that action and you can move to the next segment for free. On the “Rock of Destiny”  the following actions are available:
 
A picture of the “Rock of Destiny”. Actions on the segments are explained in more detail directly below. The small black circles are place-holders for the holes for the hero markers. 
A.	Draw Hero-card & Move.
When you take this Action, you draw a Hero-Card from your Hero-deck. Then, you may pay APs to move squares on the board with your Hero figure. For each AP you pay, you may move one space. Movement has to be orthogonal, you are not allowed to move diagonally, nor can you move through other figures. If you want to move past an enemy or are on a tile with terrain-effects, you pay additional movement points to move out of a space. Spending APs during this Action also lets you loot dead Heroes, open or close doors and chests.
B.	Special.
When you take this Action, you trigger the special ability of the Hero as listed on the Hero-sheet. Often times, these are special attacks or powerful abilities that are rare and difficult to execute. 
C.	Draw Hero-card & Attack.
When you take this Action, you draw a Hero-Card from your hero-deck and attack an enemy. Attacking works similarly in the other actions, so I’ll explain attacking in some more detail here.  Listed on your hero-sheet is your base-attack strength, which can be modified by equipment cards such as weapons. You can enhance your attack by adding APs. For each 2 APs you spend this way, you boost the attack strength by 1. If you play Hero-cards that you can play during an Attack action, you can add the value on your Attack Hero-card to the attack strength too. When a Hero card can be played is signified by specific icons on the card.  
Each monster has a passive defense-strength, which is typically modified by flipping one response card from the response deck. If your attack strength exceeds the defense-value of the defender, your attack hits and inflicts 1 wound. Cultists die after taking 1 wound, but many of the other enemies need more wounds to kill.
D.	Sprint & Draw Response-card.
A Sprint action is a specific move-action, but the APs you can spend are boosted by a free Response-card that is added to your move.
E.	Draw Hero-card & Defend.
When you take this Action, you gear up for being attacked by Enemies during their turn. When you are attacked, you normally are able to defend with just your passive defense as listed on your Hero-sheet and may add Hero- cards. If however, you have selected the Defend action on the “Rock of Destiny”, you are allowed to draw a Hero Card and add a free response card to your defense.
F.	Charge.
When you take this Action, you may spend APs to move, and after you move you may perform an attack. 
G.	Rest.
When you take this Action, you may shuffle your Hero-deck discard pile into your Hero-deck and draw back up to 5 cards. During this action, you are not allowed to play Hero-cards to aid fellow Heroes. How aiding works is explained in more detail below.
H.	Aimed Shot / Bash. This Action is different for Melee and Ranged attacks.
i.	Aimed Shot (Ranged). When you take this Action, you make 1 ranged attack. But you add an +1 on attack strength.  After attacking, you may move 1 extra space. 
ii.	Bash (Melee).  When you take this Action, you make 1 attack, but with a response-card added to your attack-strength.  Of course, you may play additional Hero-cards to boost your attack. If your attack hits, but not kills an enemy that enemy is pushed one square backwards. If you kill the enemy, you move your hero 1 space forwards. 

During a heroes’ turn, other heroes can help them out by aiding. An aiding Hero helps by playing cards from their Hero deck to boost the actions other close by heroes are taking. There is a penalty for helping out that increases with distance. Basically you subtract the distance between the heroes from the value on the Hero-card.

After the Heroes have all taken their turns, the enemies activate.
1.	Enemies draw a response card. You move the Enemy-marker on the Watchstone a number of segments equal to the number on the response card. Each action that you move past is executed for all Enemy figures on the board before moving to the next segment.
2.	Actions. The following actions can be found on the “Enemy Watchstone”. 
A.	Spawn. Place figures from the relevant spawn-pool on the board. There are two separate spawn-pools, that each have their own actions on the watchstone. The Heroes may choose which figures are placed on the board. Each Enemy figure is placed on specific location, Insect-monsters start at nests, and cultists start on trapdoors. 
B.	Move. Each Enemy moves towards the Heroes, unless the setup-sheet changes the rules. Enemies will stay at the maximal range that they can attack Heroes from. So ranged enemies will stay or move to maximum range if able. Just like the heroes, enemies are not able to move diagonally. However, enemies are not threatened by Heroes, so they incur no movement penalties moving past Heroes. They can still not move through Heroes.
Enemies move in a certain order. First insects move, then cultists, then demons (if any). Within each category of enemies, small enemies move before the larger ones.  If they can move towards multiple heroes, Enemies go for the closest hero, if tied towards the weakest hero (lowest amount of life) and if tied yet again, towards a Hero of the players’ choice. 
C.	Attack. Attacks from enemies work quite similar to attacks from heroes. Each enemy has a listed Attack-power on a reference-sheet. To the base Attack-power, a random response-deck card is added. If this combined value exceeds the Heroes base defense-value or hero-cards enhanced defense-value of the heroes, they hit and inflict a wound.  Enemies attack in the same order as during movement. Their targeting priority is a bit different. First they Attack the Hero with the lowest amount of Hit points, then to heroes using a Defend action, then Mages. If still no target has been determined, Enemies attack a Hero of the players’ choice.  
Conclusion
I’ve been following Perdition’s Mouth: Abyssal Rift since early 2015. I am a big fan of Kevin Wilson’s earlier work as designer of Descent: Journeys in the Dark and its predecessor Doom. Any dungeon-crawler that Kevin works on immediately shoots up on my watch list. When Timo sent out a request for bloggers, I signed on. I received prototype components and have voiced my opinion on several issues that came up during development of the game. So yes, I might not be 100% objective and yes, I have played the prototype with proxies. For me, playing with prototype/PnP components is never as enjoyable as playing the full game. Luckily for me, this game will be produced if the Kickstarter campaign funds.

To me, PM:AR is a highly interesting and highly promising dungeon-crawler. Many of the games in this genre have followed a certain script. In PM:AR several new ideas are implemented that give the game a very novel feel.
The main mechanism of the rondel is a very interesting mechanism. For me, the rondel is a difficult mechanism for me to wrap my head around. I find that the rondel works fine from a gameplay point of view, but I also feel that it’s not very thematic. I don’t understand why not all heroes could decide to –for example- sprint. The game explains the mechanism as follows, it’s crowded in the dungeons and not everyone can do the same action in the confusion of the battle. I get that argument, but the rondel still feels odd to me at times. That said, it does make for a very cooperative and thinky game, in the sense that taking actions recklessly leads the Heroes to certain doom.

I also really like the idea that heroes do not level up and improve, but instead weaken and die from experienced hardships. Most dungeon crawlers have the heroes improve and fight through bigger and stronger hordes of enemies. I like that, but we’ve seen that all before. Changing this premise makes PM:AR feel very fresh. On the other hand, it’s certainly frustrating at times those heroes can die. There are ways to bring them back (magic) or reboot the level, but if you have played a character a lot it’s annoying to have to let them go.

Another change from the usual is PM:AR being diceless. I like that PM:AR uses cards as a randomizer and that game events can modulate the hero and response decks. Victims rescued or forsaken, wounds taken or cured change your decks and change how the game plays. These are interesting mechanisms and something that you can’t easily implement using dice. In addition I feel it’s very thematic and engaging, making rescuing a Victim or leaving them behind matter. Either you help yourself or you help the Cult.

The largest downside of the game I found to be the lack of scaling between the various player counts. The setup-sheets do not differ depending on the number of heroes you play with. Simply put, a game with 2 heroes seems to be more difficult than a game with more players. You just have more actions and attacks available to attack and defend with. At some point, with the “Rock of Destiny” filled up, more heroes might make coordination and cooperation more difficult. But it seems that the game is easiest with certain numbers of players. To me, this is a shame and a missed opportunity to scale the game depending on the size of the playgroup.
A nitpick, for me, is that there are some locations of enemies that are not predetermined, and at times Heroes’ choice is the only way to resolve ties or indeterminate situations. In my mind, the game should come with very, very clear guidelines into this respect. 

Components of the prototype are already pretty nice. The cards don’t feature card art, but the graphic design is clear and the maps beautiful.  As of today, I’ve only seen pictures of the miniatures and these look more than fine. They might not yet be Cool Mini or Not quality, but they certainly do look good. And I am really curious to see these miniatures in their finished form.

 

Summing it all up, I think PM:AR is a very novel and engaging dungeon-crawler. The game’s innovative use of rondels, single-map levels and card-driven gameplay keeps players engaged and cooperating constantly. Teamplay and strategic thinking are key to survive the dangers of the Abyssal Rift.

I mean, we don’t want the Insectoid God to win, do we?

Great dungeon crawler! In this game you really have to work together or you will die.... It's also great that you get weaker in you adventure (what's normal if you think about it). But the thinking part is what attracted me to this game, you have limited cards, also negative cards coming in to play, you have the action wheel that do need a lot of planning to make the best of it. It is also easy to make the game harder... great design!!!

Kickstarter issues and components cockups tried to put me off this but I love it. You can have everything under control but it can all unravel very quickly on a bad tactical decision. I love it when losing feels so good. And winning feels very good too. It's the sort of game I think of new tactics while daydreaming at work. 
The errata and some of the 'invisiable rules' like threatened spaces might make it tricky to pick up again after a break but I love the feel - dungeon crawling with unique characters I care about in a gritty underground world. The prose is a bit shonky sometimes, but the gameplay helps you come up with your own story lines. A great game.

In a matter of only one week and four great games, Perdition's Mouth: Abyssal Rift has displaced Mage Knight as my favorite solitaire adventure game and ranks higher than every fantasy themed game I've played to date, excepting only the necrotic Cave Evil.

Several things distinguish Perdition's Mouth Abyssal Rift from other fantasy board games that I've played. First, the art is terrific and unique: This game is not soft and upbeat heroic fantasy, but horror fantasy, and the grim dungeons and horrid creatures all enrich the theme. Wounds that your characters sustain are card specified things like pulped hands and nausea, rather than simply "hit points".  Creatures are arachnid and crustacean hybrids with demonic attributes and the cultists that serve the underworld blow poisoned darts or flee to ring the alarm, depending upon their character. The feel is great, dark, and oppressive: This game is hard.

The mechanic of single or multiple action selection on a wheel is a cool variation on action cards, and as in a game like Gunslinger, the players are sometimes unable to do the most desirable action at a critical point. Good planning helps, but if the enemy is given the opportunity to make three or four moves in a single turn, your plans may soon be useless. Perdition's Mouth has the puzzle component that makes Mage Knight such a brain burner, but there is more action on the board in PM, which keeps the theme more to the fore, especially since combat is far better detailed (the abstracted combat is my least favorite thing about Mage Knight).  At times, Perdition's Mouth reminds me of narrative wargames like Ambush! or (the good parts of) Raid on St. Nazaire. But the treasures, miniatures, personalities of the creatures, and special abilities all make it strong fantasy.

My criticisms are small. The rulebook is very confusing up top, but gets better by page 5, though still could be clearer, especially with more illustrations of gameplay and the various combinations that exist. Also, at times I'm not sure how much intelligence to give the enemy. When they have two equidistant paths to their target (the weakest hero), should I give them the intelligence not to get in each other's way or an even a higher level intelligence in terms of anticipating my plans in subsequent turns? The answer is probably "don't overthink this too much, just move them in order", but almost always I err on making my enemies too smart rather than too simple. So yeah...I spend a little more time gaming the enemy than I'd like, but that's a pretty minor quibble.

Bottom Line:
I highly recommend this game to people who like fantasy games or wargames or both, especially gamers who relish puzzling dilemmas during the fray. The combat is cool, the art is terrific, the components (boards and miniatures) are at the highest level (this is the heaviest/thickest board I've ever felt), and peril exists from the very first turn until you get out of that deadly dungeon. This isn't rehashed orcs, dragons, and knights fantasy, but a unique, moody, and harrowing dungeon crawl that is immersive, challenging, tense, and fun.

Awesome co-op where having a turn in which everyone manages to do something is incredibly hard.
Ghost stories is incredibly easy compared to this one.

This took a while. I usually give my thoughts about a game after one or three plays. For [thing=149787][/thing] I recorded my friends comments and my own after the plays - as scenarios based games tend to need a broader scope. I let them marinated and be discussed during several sessions and see if we still remained in the same position or not - than I would write them down.

This is what we got after playing a full campaign of the base game.

[b]Play 1:[/b]
The set up took some time - I think a little less than Galaxy Defenders - maybe because it was the first time, as we aren't aware of the pieces and decks. The rules are not all that hard, but isn't simple either, with the many different possibilities regarding the wheel of actions and the unique deck every character has - we didn't stumble in too much problems, but a few conditions and relations between the spot of the action and the what we could do brought some reading of the rules and discussion, taking some of the adventurous fun of playing a dungeon crawler.

The predictable conditions of movement and attack from the different types of creatures, and the blocking of LOS and spaces, also made for a game with an uneven pace: as with Galaxy Defenders, being able to predict and work around the AI of the monsters, in order to obtain the best possible result, meant that every move/action was trying to be max out, and the play went on to last more than it was good for it. The AI could also be explored in a bad way, if the players want (we had a situation in which we could lock up four creatures, neither ever being able to move to its objective) - we went on with the "worst for us" deal, but this isn't required in the rules, nor, with proper AI, it would be necessary.

[b]Plays 2 to 5:[/b]
The constant blocking (so. much. blocking.) of LOS and movement, thematic with the small tunnels, remind me a of Space Hulk - not being able to move diagonally meant, as for the AI of the creatures, much talk of positioning - which is, on itself, good, as positioning should be important, however, in Doom not only is important, but is key to the whole thing, and you can move diagonally; objectively, the LOS and blocking rules made for, yet again, debates among the turns, hurting quite a bit the flow of the game - it could be the intention here: making a thinky dungeon crawler, but I miss the romp, the brashness and overconfidence of other dungeon crawlers. And we lost several - too many - doing nothing, due to be behind others, blocked by creatures, without being able to move or attack by lack os LOS. Not fun in the least.

We also had many issues with rules - some corner cases (going full circle in the wheel, teleport concerns, etc) that either we didn't found an answer or did, but it was really hard to find. I won't enter in details, as I wasn't the one reading it, nor looking for answers. The rulebook and the scenarios also are poorly made: lots of typos (Bastian is called Bastion; many mistakes in the set up of scenarios; and others).

[b]Plays 6 to 10:[/b]
The scenarios also lack more variety: in all the first five, the goal is simply going from the entrance to the exit. There is nothing to truly do in the scenarios except opening a path to the exit. There are levers in two of them, but is possible to simply break the door or portcullis. Why not add some more features to actually do different things while going to the exit? Unlock something, destroy something, open something, kill someone. No, just going from A to B - in as much as a straight line as possible. It is as if the game tries to not be fun: the same goal in the scenarios, lots of blocking (in the board and in the wheel) - in scenario 4A, for instance, we didn't even used around 75% of it. It was acolyte town, and yes, you can go there to try to prevent them from raising the alarm. But since we started with the alarm at 4 and the maximum is 5, after a couple sounded the bell, we didn't even care what the other 6, 8 of them would do. Is it weird; and this is common around this game.

There are problems with the scalability: the more players, the easier the scenarios are. The only counter to the addition of characters is increasing the alarm, which makes more creatures to enter - this can make a difference, but, in the grand scheme, matters little. We felt a big difference in difficulty when playing with less people.

The involution - is this the right word? - of the characters didn't really worked for us. [thing=149787]Perdition's Mouth[/thing] has a not usual idea: the campaign makes the heroes weaker each time - though some treasures can be found, these don't outweight the injuries that go into the player's decks after taking damage - it can go to a point that many turns are simply lost due to a high amount of injuries going into the player hand of cards. At a point, one hero had more wound cards in his deck than normal cards, and a second one, was almost 50/50. Add this to the amount of blocking and wasted turns, you get a recipe for not a fun time. The idea of involution is bold, and even thematic, still is better on paper than living it.

[b]End game:[/b]
The last chapter was more of the same: we walked in the first corridor, than got blocked and barely took an step forward. Elisa was able to teleport, than got killed. Simma was able to open some room in order for him to run. The other ones sacrificed for him to be able to escape. Not a bad ending to tell, sure, but fun was, yet again, limited.

Considering now, with the campaign done, [thing=149787][/thing] barely works, and I'm not impressed. We didn't even got a closing text for the end - just things are done, flee and, fade to black, as there is no end credits.

The wheel of actions is truly nice and make for difficult decisions, cooperation and interaction between the players. But the AI, movement and blocking rules take much of the life and joy. It took us months to close the campaing, as we simply didn't want to come back.

With the campaign over, we can't wait to pass on to something more lively. There are some very good ideas here, but the feel we had is that there are too many rough spots, and is simply boring in many moments. [thing=149787]Perdition's Mouth[/thing] seems made for solo play, as who will actually be able to do [i]something[/i] won't matter as much - with multiplayer, there are just too many lost turns and wasted time.

Overall, [thing=149787]Perdition's Mouth[/thing] is an experience - with many unique and novel ideias -; however is one none of us will ever want to repeat.

RATING: 10
An excellent dungeon crawl with euro aspects (rondel). Very good production quality. An excellent value if you like minis.  (I've become more of fan of standees, since I have not been painting my minis, but these minis are good quality. Plus they offer a painting guide in the latest KS campaign - "Revised Edition".)

Perdition's Mouth was easy to learn and I find it straightforward and logical to play. The whole gaming experience is different when it's not about each taking their turns, but working as a team. For me playing Perdition's Mouth is puzzle solving with friends.

Backing in KS. Rating based on watching the play throughs and other experience of games with the sort of Euro mechanics in the game. I have always loved the idea of dungeon crawlers given my interest in fantasy but never liked D100 games so this is an excellent fit for me and I am really looking forward to it

Really a great game. Very challenging. The rondel really makes the players plan ahead and makes the enemies unpredictable. The players really need to work closely together to achieve the scenario/campaign objectives. Aiding other players is the secret to success in this game. The game is quite different from other "dungeon crawlers" and offers an innovative and refreshing twist that makes the game a valuable addition to anyone's collection. Highly recommended!

Excellent and different. Don't expect wounds to heal presto and gone. They'll follow you into the depths and fester. Interesting rondel mechanics.

RATING: N/A
Fantasy card driven RPG dungeon crawl. Heroes delve deeper into scenario-based dungeon levels in an action point system using a rondel. Some interesting mechanics; I like how the AI engine auto adjusts the threat level based on hero actions (e.g. picking up a relic or letting the guard sound a warning). I like how the monster rondel mechanic determines the number and type of monster actions. Push your luck element as players spend cards and/or multi use cards from their hand to improve their probability of success. Not sure if I like drawing from a reaction deck of normally distributed values. I prefer the random luck element of luck opposed to card counting. I like how this game allows for more robust teamwork play with the assist option to share resource cards within proximity.  The player boards are well laid out to show reduced action points and other player stats as wounds are taken. I like how a wound card is added to the hero deck in deck builder style to weaken your action deck. Very nice touch.

Just received my copy, so rating is quite preliminary based on component quality and watching some of the how to play videos here on site.

While I enjoy rondel Euro games, it simply did not work in this game.  In good Euro games, the spokes in the rondel progress in a logical fashion.  In this game, it simply felt gamey, made your characters inefficient, and did not make sense thematically,  Even worse, there is only one spoke where you can move and attack in the same round.  Otherwise, you can find yourself moving up and then having the enemy move away.  The tactical decisions are pretty minor - which card to play, because the only other tactic is to get in range and attack.  It also makes no sense that a character would not attack or move if it was beneficial.  Furthermore, I really dislike dungeon crawlers where you cannot move through friendly characters or move diagonally fairly freely.  When movement is this restricted and corridors are only one or two spaces wide, it is easy for one to three characters to end up congested and not able to be very productive. Then when you get hit, not only do you lose a hit point, but then you get stuck with a wound card that may last for several scenarios.

Even if they fixed the gameplay issues, I would still not like this game.  The characters, their powers, and their cards are pretty boring.  The monsters have nice minis, but they are still pretty boring.  While the map artwork is nice, the rooms and scenarios were also boring.  While there are some interesting treasures, they were often so far out of the way and mixed in with traps, it was often not worth it to invest the time to check them out.

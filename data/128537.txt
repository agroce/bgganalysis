I'm not familiar with the series this game is based on but that doesn't really dissuade me from playing it. In Gentlemen thieves you play one of four burglars who want to win by having the most loot at the end of the game. The trick is, you form temporary alliances with other thieves and no one knows who is who. A interesting mix of deduction and provisional alliance. I didn't love it but it 'twas... Alright,

Clever, quick, unique. Not a ton of complexity here, but nifty combination of a cool theme (high society Parisian burglars) and deduction/area majority mechanics.

Good game for couples. Very attractive components, beautifully presented, with a nice cat and mouse aspect. Some rules ambiguities and a complete lack of designer/publisher interest or support led me to sell it.

A cool concept with a missed execution. The hidden elements melt away quickly and you're left with a vaguely tactical mess behind a paper thin mask.

Another game with beautiful components. The box is fantastic. I like boxes that are part of the game. The hidden identities aspect was interesting, but it wasn't that hard to figure out in a 4 player game.

A game of secret identities and greed. I'm not good with secrets but greed is right up my alley.

This is probably a decent game, but color blindness issues and significant gameplay overlap with Clans led me to sell it off.

RATING: 6
I do not understand the comments that this game works better with larger numbers. To the contrary, the real strategic aspects of this game are at their best when there are fewer players (indeed it works really well with 2). Yes it is a bit easier to figure out the identity of your opponent when there are fewer players but opportunity for real strategic alliance building, misdirection, and bluffing comes out in the 2 player game. Very interesting for those who like games that require you to think about and analyze every choice made.

RATING: 6.5
This is a pretty simple game that sounds confusing when you first hear it explained to you. However, once you play a round or two you get the idea in no time. It is interesting to try to throw people off as to who you are. I play this with my husband and extended family.

RATING: 5
Clever seeming hidden teams game except the hidden roles become transparent pretty quickly and it devolves into a kind of stock game, except your company is fixed, the alliances are set by one player each round, and the investments are determined by random tile draw. *shrug*

Too little control makes this one a miss for me.

Pas mal du tout. Assez original dans ses mécanismes, et joli dans sa fabrication.

RATING: 6.5
It has many of the characteristics I usually look for in a game.  Interactive, bluffing, hidden roles, deduction.  It is actually fairly competitive, and in the second play it slowed down as everyone got more careful with the strategy and moves.  What I missed was the humor and surprise element that usually accompanies these types of games, it seemed to be more competitive and analytical than I expected.  By the way, excellent presentation, original board and pieces, belies the actual complexity of the gameplay.  The rating might change based on more plays.

RATING: 6
It's one of those games that is as good as your opponents are. It can be a thrilling game, but also a boring and planned "one-two-three" game. Best is to play with 4 or 5 players. 2 or 3 players is just a time filler.

PS: Also the rule book in English is quite bad translation from French original.

RATING: 6
If Infiltration is like a high stakes heist, Gentleman Thieves is more like listening to the tumblers while trying to crack a safe.  I like the idea of choosing alliances and then splitting loot, but the gameplay feels mechanical rather than exciting.  I think the components could have been produced in a way that makes it clearer which location is about to score (for example, the stethoscope and grappling hook look almost identical).  The special tokens also don't seem to be particularly useful.  Can play with fewer than five, but the game is probably better with more people.

RATING: 5
The box for this is really cool. The hidden players is okay. Probably better done than most games that have hidden player colors, but still suffers from the obvious choices for players. My little sister really enjoyed it.

Gioco di bluff, intuito e, un po' di fortuna. Veloce e semplice è un gioco che si lascia giocare, Lupin e i sui complici cercheranno di conquistare più bottini possibili prima dell'arrivo del gendarme. Materiali buoni, gioco carino.

Jogo que me interessou bastante pelos componentes e me desiludiu de igual modo pela fraca fidelidade e irritante jogabilidade, pois o controlo do jogo é muito, mas mesmo muito pouco! A arte é belíssima, a interação do jogo com a própria caixa é surpreendente, a qualidade dos componentes é bestial e o facto de não precisar de unpunch é muito agradável, no entanto, as opções especiais são inúteis e aqui e ali havia muitos detalhes por limar para podermos considera-lo um jogo a repetir...

Like a stealthy thief, this game seems to have gone largely unnoticed.  While fortunate for the thief, this is quite unfortunate for what I feel is a very, VERY good game!  It's a game of hidden identities, sneaky play, bluffing, deduction, shifting alliances, and sharing rewards but making sure that you get the most.  It's whimsically illustrated and even has a clever box that doubles as a game play area!  My only complaint with the game is that it doesn't do enough to discourage players from being very obvious about their identities (and to address this I've come up with a simple end-game bonus scoring based on guessing the identities of the other players while keeping your own hidden).  Also, you'll ideally want 4-5 players for this one.  Perhaps the game is too light for some and doesn't provide enough control for others, but I sure get a kick out of the experience that this game provides!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

The good news is that if you can't get your hands on the OOP game Clans there's now Gentlemen Thieves which has the better theme and chrome. The bad news is that despite these positives and the fact that Clans looks abstract, Clans is still the better game. The problem with Thieves is that it feels repetitive and offers fewer decisions than Clans. I admit I only played it once, but I knew I liked Clans immediately. Just don't have the desire to play Thieves again. But if I didn't already own Clans, I'd probably feel better about Thieves.

One of two games designed by trio Catherine Dumas, Charles Chevallier and Pascal Pelemans, I've decided if games look pretty good by the same designers, I want to support them, enjoy their games and understand and appreciate their unique voices and styles.

After about 4 games, it gets quite boring. You're basically doing the same thing over and over. Art and quality is absolutely gorgeous, and still worth the money I'd say.

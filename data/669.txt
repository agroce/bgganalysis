Det är roligt när det är jämt. Problemet är att man inte vet hur de andra spelarna ligger till poängmässigt. Man kanske skulle kunna ha tre närliggande värden på befolkningskorten så att man kan bilda sig en uppfattning om ungefär var de andra ligger till.

A wonderfully-themed "Take That!" game with plenty of opportunity to kick others while they are down. Very popular with the game group at work. Cards have beautiful thematic artwork. You have to be in the right mood and willing to accept a game which has a large luck factor. A shame it's long out of print.

The game consists of 2 phases.  A population growth and a population extinction.  The first half of the game has a larger luck factor.  The second half (plague) has a real sense of 'take that!'.  This can be done in a mean-spirited target way (bad) or in a light almost chaotic way (good).  The play group will determine which style of game play emerges.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

Light, ghoulish game of killing other players population off. Almost totally luck driven but full of "take that" cards. Similar to Nuclear War but without waiting for missile + warhead combo to kill people.

Vicious, yet quite fun. However, the card-stock is poor, and the cards could use a splash of color.

RATING: 6
Another one of my many thrift store finds.  Didn't have a clue about it, but the pen and ink art was cool, as were the dice with skulls on them.  Played only once with just two of us--not super exciting, but we both agreed that with more players, the interaction would improve and all 'bad' cards wouldn't have to be fielded by just one player...unless you really wanted to gang up on someone.  Yes, we all have one of those players in our game groups that could always do with a lesson in humility.  If you can't think of who that may be in your group, then more than likely it's you.  Looking forward to trying this with more players.  [Thrift $1.09] Traded away at GameStorm12's math trade for Mare Nostrum and the Mythology expansion.

RATING: 6
For as rare as this game is, my buddy finds it astounding that I've discovered two copies of this at thrift stores.  Traded away the first copy at GameStorm12 for Mare Nostrum and the Mythology expansion.  May not be as lucky with this copy.  The cards look unplayed and are in wonderful condition.  Seven reference cards and all 70 playing cards are present and accounted for.  Unfortunately, only 55 of 64 population cards were in the box: [9-5PPs, 40-10PPs, and 6-50PPs].  It looks like 9-5PP cards are awol.  It is my belief that you can still play the game just fine with the population point cards that are present.  Both dice are in a box that shows obvious shelf wear, especially along the edges and corners, but it still does its job.  The original rule set is present and in good shape as well.  You'll have to determine the value of such a find yourself if you're interested in a trade, but I'm not going to just give it away for nothing either, even with the few missing cards.  Traded away second copy at GameStorm14.

RATING: 2
Simplistic game.  Aside from a few attacks, this game consists of rolling a die and drawing a card each turn and hoping that you get the lucky cards that keep you alive.  More of an exercise than a game.  Think LCR.  Making matters worse, it probably takes 30-45 minutes to play.

RATING: 7
This game is pretty good. Not as good as the sum of it's parts, however. The theme is funny, the art is terrific, and the rules are fun. Actual play is not quite as good however. This is one of those games that would be great with the right group. Excellent for fans of the Warhammer fantasy world.

This game has often been compared to "Nuclear War" but I have to say that I enjoyed this game much more.  The Artwork and the "Death's Head" dice that come along support the theme of the game very well.  For a "light" game, it's very well done.

RATING: 4
This game has been on my wanted list almost since I started collecting. I just loved the idea, building your city till the plague ship comes and then trying to be the last to die once it does. Finally picked up a copy through a very odd trade here on BGG. Played it... and was rather dissappointed. It plays almost exactly like a medieval themed version of the Nuclear War card game, which was never one of my favourites. Play feels a little aimless. You whack one of your opponants, they whack you. If you're unlucky or unpopular you die first. I know this wasn't supposed to be a brain-bending strategic game, but even in a beer-n-pretzels it should feel like there is some reason to make one more over another. Maybe it will grow on me.

RATING: 8.5
A simple card game with a rather unique theme and mechanic - roll dice to increase your population, then hope to survive once the "Plague" card comes out and your population begins to disappear.

A light card game based around the Black Plague of the Middle Ages.

This is one of my favorite games, and nearly impossible to find.

EDIT: I FINALLY got it!  Thank you to the kind people who were involved in the trade to get P&P in my hands.  Words cannot express my gratitude.  I finally get to play this game after waiting nearly 15 years.

This game plays best with 5 or 6 players, rather than 2.  It takes too long for the ship to arrive, which means lots of turns to build up the population.  The ship will come much faster with more players.

Still, a ton of fun.  Very glad that I got this game.

Fun, light, super-fast game.  In the first phase of the game, players gain population.  In the second phase, after the plague strikes, players lose population; the last player with citizens left wins.  Special cards can cause natural disasters or wars in other players' countries, or protect against such attacks.

And who can resist a game with a name like this?

RATING: 8
I rated this game an 8 because I'd probably always be willing to roll some dice for 20-30 minutes.  This game is innovative, but largely driven by luck.  Players do get to decide if they're going to build improvements to slam opponents with strife, but, ultimately, I think it's luck with the dice that will determine the winner.

It's an 8, but a different kind of 8 than I would give to a really great historical simulation.

RATING: 6
Game is best approached as a very light-hearted chance to inflict as much mayhem to your fellow players as possible.  As a late night closer when you have no brain cells left, it's the perfect choice.  Not to be taken seriously under any circumstances however.  Play this one just for the fun of it.

Players try to keep their population breeding ahead of the plague (which is trying to do the opposite).  Rather grim themed card game where you are trying to be the last player with any people alive in the game.  Great looking cards, done in medieval woodcut style, but the game play didn't do much for me.

RATING: 9
Such a great little card game with some beautiful art that really should be in print. There isn't much to the game, and there isn't much skill involved. Roll a dice, apply the result, draw a card, play a card. So you're reliant on dice rolls and card draws. What it does successfully though is cause interaction between people. Cause people to be confrontational when so often games encourage people into their own little space and applauds when you don't bother others. Which I feel is a shame. Highly deserving of a reprint though and I wish more games had this style art.

There's a lot of luck to this game but I love the theme.  The cards are creepy and the mechanics are simple and easy to understand.  It works best with 3-4 people.  Having 2 people fight a war against each other is HI-lariously good to watch.  I never would have thought it would be worth that much money (limited release). And like the geek that I am, I'm not going to sell me copy.

This has turned into a grail game?  When did that happen?  I picked up P&P years ago after reading about it in Dragon Magazine.  It underwhelmed.  The game itself is an excercise in playing cards one at a time.  Initially you build defenses, and then at some arbitrary time a plague ship card comes up and you start attacking your opponents.  Most of the cards you play will kill your opponent's population.  Eventually no one is left.  P&P plays like a less-fun game of Nuclear War without the spinner.  The art is evocative, however.  Avoid!

(Not mentioning the fact that, like many similar games, like Bang and Werewolf, people get knocked out early.)  Only saving grace is that this one usually is over quickly.

Take that and that's all there is to it.  Bad experiences with this 'take that' game will not encourage me to return to it any time soon.  Cannot believe the collectability of this title.  It does confirm to me that I am not a collector.

Simple card game, extremely random. "Tactic" is obvious: play good cards upon you, bad cards upon the leader and hope to roll dice better than the opponents. There aren't interesting decision to take and thus satisfaction is null.

I've easily played this at least 100 times over the years, just not so often since I started logging plays on BGG.  It's an easy-to-teach take-that card game that's great as an opener or closer, or as filler.  Everyone I've ever taught it to has liked it.

The art, in the style of Holbein's Dance of Death, is absolutely terrific.

Well worth picking up if it's ever reprinted.  I see that this often goes for (or is listed for, at any rate) $100+ in the marketplace.  I'm not sure I'd pay that for it now, but if I had paid that when I bought it back in the '90s I think I would have gotten my money's worth out of it by now.

I imagine this was inspired by Nuclear War. It's a fun, "take that", but don't take it too seriously game. Like many of these types of games "Family Business, etc." there is a dash of tactical skill but it's really all about having a good time destroying each other.

I can't see why anyone would pay the money this goes for in the marketplace.  The idea is sounds intriguing but it is a card game equivilant of roll and move.  There is little real card variety.  A bit of very light take that fun.

Not much to it to either offend or recommend.  P&P is much like Nuke War in theme and general play, but somehow lacks the amusement factor of NW. I'd play this again if I had some time to kill between games, but would probably seek out an alternative if given a choice.

RATING: 5
Reminiscent of Nuclear War, but rethemed as duelling medieval cities. The last player to have any population in their city after the plague hits is the winner. You start with equal population and in the early part of the game this increases each turn. Then [b][i]The Plague Ship[/b][/i] shows up and everything goes to the dogs.

Turns are in two parts. First of all, dice are rolled to determine population changes, as modified by various city improvements. Second, you play a card, either to improve your city or harm an opponent. Prior to The Plague Ship, the dice roll increases population. After The Plague Ship this is reversed; nosegays all round and piles of corpses up to the ramparts.

This is a light, very random game, with plenty of leader bashing and extremely fast play. Duration is probably about 5 minutes per player. The cards are black and white, quite detailed, in the style of woodcuts. Albrecht Dürer illustrates a card game.

LOVE this obscure, fast-playing little card game. I first learned of it at work when a fellow MtG fan brought it as a 'break' game between rounds. We were between projects and had a lot of free time, obviously.

P&P has gorgeous period-esque art and quick, simple mechanic for a nice slap-fest game of mass death. Can't ask for a better filler item!

Not a lot of replay value and the cards are too monotonous in appearance and the game can easily run on a bit too long.  Theme not quite as shocking to new gamers as is Nuclear War's but some people just don't seem to think mass death by Plague to be funny or even gameable.

This is a fun game and it's easy to take out your aggression on someone. There is a lot of chance in what you roll on the dice for prosperity and plague. Howver, all in all, it doesn't detract from the fun of the game. My friends are very proud of the fact that they have put me out of the game during the prosperity phase when everyone is supposed to be building up their city.

Very random game, nuke who ever is in the lead.  You can build improvements but they die very quickly so there is not much point.  Game lasts too long.  Art is supposed to look like wood cuts, but unlike the best wood cuts there is not enough difference between the light and dark areas, the result just looks muddy.  The special 'death dice' are two die 6's with a skull in place of a one.

I remember purchasing this back when it had come out in the game shop I was working at.  I grabbed it because I am a bit of a medieval history buff, and the art appealed to me.

Favorite of my gaming group.  Sort of a Medieval version of Nuclear War, though a bit more simple.  This is a good little beer & pretzels game that usually (unless the Death Ship is the very last card in the deck) plays quickly.  (Added 12/12/07): Ye Gods!  Are copies really selling for that much these days?!!  Maybe I should lock mine in a bank vault instead of playing with it ...

A fun game for all levels of ability to play. Even reluctant players enjoy the game with simple rules to learn. It is a good example of a town trying to survive and grow before the Plague arrives.

Plague & Pestilence isn't as good as I rated it. It's a pretty meh card and points game that isn't helped by the addition of dice to randomize it even further. So, why the heady heights of a '5'?

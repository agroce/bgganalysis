RATING: 7
Rating for Free print & play version (which may or may not now be available).

Provisional rating based on reading the rules and a test play of some combat.
Sort of like a cross between Doom & Space Hulk but set in a parallel world where WWII has dragged on due to Nazi experiments on zombie creation.
Awesome for free!

Great theme (nazi zombies, mutations and chicks) against a futuristic nato-like army (a bunch of non-descript green soldiers with gas masks and super weapons) what-if 2nd world war theme, tries to be something between Space Hulk and Tannhauser, I would just play Space Hulk and Tannhauser instead. There are also minis for this.

RATING: 5
Very simple system. Fast and furious game. But because it's so simple, the game plays suffers and felt very gamey. 

The over watch rules make shooting models very strong in a corridor. A ted too strong for my liking. Some scenarios are pro Allies. The Germans are there to 'make a story' and that's about it. Please read the rules properly for reaction fire (over watch), it's movement and shooting only. 

Card play is the worse. It swings both ways widely. No jamming rolls so ammo is not a worry. Grenades are weapons of choice as Every throw is an automatic hit on the square thrown to. So every grenade lands precisely like a Golf game. 

Overall. A Space Hulk Clone. Average game play.

RATING: 7
Played a few times, but in great condition.

An interesting zombie game set in an alternate WWII setting.  It is a two player game, requiring strategy to win and not just luck.

Based on a first in-depth reading of the rules I give this game a temporary rating (might rise) of 8. This feels like an even more itense Space Hulk with some extra tactical depth.

Yes, the whole steam-punk, alternate history thing has been explored in many games, and so this breaks no new ground, but judged on it's own merit it is a very good game. Tight and neat rules this is something of a dark horse as I didn't so much discover it as stumble into it by chance.

Near-perfect.  Incursion's pulpy theme is presented really well, and the mechanics lead to a highly strategic battle-of-the-minds style gameplay.  I could just keep going on about how I love this game.  It has its flaws, though.  I understand that the game is based for miniatures, and I really appreciate that they tried to make it accessible for people who don't have hundreds of dollars to drop on a new boardgame, but even so, the components leave a little to be desired.  There's a serious lack of stands that comes up in every single game.

On top of that, I really wish that there was an easy way to make the game playable for more than two people.  It's too great to limit to the occasional duel.

i gave it 10, because this game is what thunderstone was to dominion. Incursion is like my favourite game SpaceHulk but (i am afraid i have to say it :D) through the use of various gameplay additions, it's even BETTER. i really am astounded how good this is. The only bad thing about it is the price, but hell if it means supporting the small independent producer, i am more than willing to do it.
Even with 3rd edition and tenths of pages GW couldn't avoid chaotic and vague instruction for Space Hulk. Incursion in spite of being more elaborate manages to squeeze all the rules clearly withing a few pages. Thats how its done! 
Also, almost painfully vivid and characteristic setting in incursion, being a historical cliff-hanger taken from the Secrets of the Third Reich tabletop game managed to capture my attention and let my imagination go wild even before i opened the rulebook.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game would be greatly enhanced with the miniatures.  The cardboard stand-ups are acceptable.  I love the artwork which captures the steampunk / weird history feel of the game.  Is it me, or does the 7th seem overpowered?  My buddy & I took turns playing both sides & each time the 7th won.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The rulebook could be clearer, but this is an excellent game, with some real challenge to the scenarios.  If I had to choose between this and the outstanding Claustrophobia, I'd be torn.  Each does the two-player scenario treatment differently, but they both seem perfect by their own merits.  I do think that Incursion's theme -- while awful familiar to Dust and Tannhauser fans -- is an out-of-the-park home run.  A must buy for anyone wanting longevity from a two-player game.

Good and bad is the game comes with no minis and they have to be purchased separately: good because it's cheaper and no painting required, yet still a high quality components. bad because I'll buy the minis if I get the game.

If I didn't already have and enjoy Earth Reborn, this would be an auto purchase.

How any euro game ever released, can rank higher than games like this, is a travesty of justice. 
To paraphrase Samuel L Jackson, You can shove ya well laid cubes up ya well laid....


Uber thematic tactical Weird World War 2 scenario driven customisable Squad Game, that takes the long held crown from space hulk and those robbing games workshop shitehawks. Ironic that the game came about due to the lack of space hulk availability, then totally pissed all over it! Excellent job JB.

The yanks were late to both world wars, but are always first into the game box. So you have to buy the expansion to get real soldiers, our boys, the British. I am used to that by now though. 
Overpaid, Oversexed and Over-here, in Deeetroit made, diesel fuelled armour. As my gran would have said! 
But being able to command a kind of off book rogue SS Paranormal Division, led by a family of sick mutated freaks. You therefore get to munch on said Yanks with werewolves and nazi zombies. Or maybe have a half naked nazi St Trinian supersoldier chick empty a mag from her smg, or try a suicide bomber zombie rush instead, why not even harpoon the mo-fo's for good measure. Top quality. This makes up for it, and then some!

As you can tell, a game that really appeals to my over sensitive, liberal, yoghurt knitting, politically correct soul!

Think Castle Wolfenstein meets 'Allo 'Allo meets Space Hulk.

Absolutely fucking rockin'!

Own:

2 Core Sets 
SNAFU...obviously.
Full painted set of metal minis on custom bases
Painted resin doors and objective set
DIY 3D Terrain
And the very sexy poster on my living room wall!
Have since convered all my yank APES to Brit APES, and photoshopped a deck of cards to suit. An all MI-13 game now.

Have Kickstarted for:

Metal droptroopers

RATING: 9
In this alternate history of WWII, Nazi Germany develops a biological weapon which turns the people it kills into zombies. This allows the Germans to drag the war out. Franco ends up joining the Axis and with Spanish support Germany takes the Rock of Gibraltar from the British. The Germans extend the network of underground passages under the Rock and set up a research and command base there. The Allies mount a massive assault and retake the Rock, but they are beaten back by the horrors underground. They discover that the Nazis were in the process of constructing a doomsday device in the labs. They decide to seal exits from the underground caves and send in commando teams to clear the caves and destroy the device.

The game has simple rules but there are a surprising number of tactical considerations you need to make during your turn.

RATING: 3
I really dislike this game and greatly regret my purchase. The game's rules are clunky and the designers often mix flavor with rules.

The game feels highly imbalanced against the Germans. The Allies are incredibly difficult to hit and have tons of ranged weaponry (and the uber powerful return fire), whereas the Germans are mostly hand to hand with no option to return fire. Oh, and they are much more likely to die from enemy attacks.

For the cost, this game should have come with some miniatures (like the ones pasted all over the site). This is just not a good war game. There are so many better options.

Very nice, plays well and captures the theme of blazing into a secret laboratory overrun with zombies.  Have upped the score as it deserves it.

Have managed to play twice through the scenarios, and that Doomsday device keeps going off!  Perhaps one day the world will be saved?

Never given a game a 1 rating before, but I have to here. I want to like this game, and I am going to give it another shot in time, but for the moment the game is flawed to the point of being broken.

Nice theme, nice art, nice miniatures - albeit expensive.

Pretty much a copy of what has gone before game wise, Incursion however gets one thing fatally wrong - command points. In larger games the command points can throw tactics and careful decisions out the window as it all comes down to CP spamming at prime moments. One figure can literally cross the entire board space in a single turn if they spam all their CP.

If you've played Space Hulk, imagine a genestealer - any genestealer - with 20 odd movement points instead of its 6. 

The larger the game, the more unbalanced the CPs. I am unsure whether this game was tested with a CP spamming strategy or whether the testers played like gentlemen to avoid such issues.

The nasty suspicion is that this game is just a vehicle for the expensive miniatures, and that mechanically its broken.

House ruling may save the day yet, but I fear any fix of the CP issue will just introduce more lumps into the game.

A shame, could have been nice.

Jan 2012- just got it, along with SNAFU and the SWD starter pack. The figures are great, but after a few years of working almost exclusively with plastics, I had almost forgotten how annoying it is to put together multi part metal miniatures... I made my own APEs from bits and pieces I had lying around, partly because it´s pretty expensive getting a full set, partly because I like getting creative and building and painting stuff like that... looking forward to playing...

#¤%&$!!! One of Gretel´s pigtails had broken off... that was annoyingly fiddly to put back on! 
(Luckily I have a lot of patience when it comes to fixing pigtails, thanks to my 2 year old daughter... :) )

May 2014: Got added as a late, late, latecomer to the Kickstarter, went all in with Buckets of Blood to get all the sexy plastic minis... Really wanted the exclusives and the Drop Troopers...

This is an awesome game, and a perfect replacement for anyone who can't get a chance to play Space Hulk. Some of the decisions in Incrusion are much more difficult than in Space Hulk, but yet it still manages to have that straight forward feel that Space Hulk has. I could possibly be selling my entire Space Hulk collection to try and get fully into this one, and that is a big deal. I also find that the theme is much more enjoyable. Every model has a flavor all their own, as opposed to the mostly generic Space Marine. The game is also quite stunning to behold. The box art has to be the best I have ever seen, bar none. Do yourself a favor and really support Grindhouse Games, and Incursion, they deserve it.

[u]Ratings Update:[/u]
After finally getting my greedy little hands on the all new kickstartered second edition I can honestly say that playing it was a dream come true. Ever since my grunt APEs took their first steps into that cavernous lair under Gibraltar I have dreamed of playing the game with miniatures. With the price of the miniatures being what they were I never though I would ever get to cross that item off my bucket list. In 2013 Jim and John at Grindhouse Games kept that spark alive, and in 2015 they made that dream a reality. This is honestly one of the greatest games ever designed and contains thousands of hours of fun. If you were lucky enough to get a copy of the second edition cherish it, it will probably become of the rarest and most sought after grail games for years to come. Now where is my Zombie Pinger?

Well, this works pretty well. The command points are a nice touch and the battle cards can be painfully effective. Pittily, those same cards are also of not-so-great cardboard and start to bend in a lot of directions at the same time, which is quite annoying. Also, there are far to few Sturmzombie stand-ups included. We need more Sturmzombies over here, please.

Reaction fire tends to feel a bit strong since you don't need to spend AP to activate it  (like you would in Space Hulk).  

Pales a bit in comparison to things like Star Wars: Imperial Assault (skirmish) and the new Doom board game.  Both of those games tend to have more going on so they are deeper and have more interesting decisions to make each turn.  

For now, this has a spot on my shelf, but I have a feeling it' won't stay there forever.

I thought about building the pnp version but I decided to support the company and just buy the (original) boxed game.  The components are nice but a few issues affect my rating.  I suggest using an xacto to free the cardboard pieces.  I also sleeved my cards since they are black bordered.   I'm not really a fan of how the plastic holders hack up the standees so I've replaced those as well.

Didn't feel the need to get the new edition, though I like the game.  I don't require real miniaures either.

Games like this really have to have some sort of interesting mechanism to hold my interest, because simply putting an elementary combat system in a game and telling you to go for it doesn't work for me. Incursion has an excellent theme, but the rules are rudimentary at best. In many ways, this game reminds me of Space Hulk without the high production values that game has. Unfortunately, games like Zombicide have made me lose interest in these sad excuses for games trying to build a game around a really simple combat system.

The best of the "Weird War" games I have tried. The rules are simple enough to just jump in and play  yet games can be tense  and very tactical. Like how the use of "battle cards" can alter the game. Great line of miniatures available. Looking forward to the newly announced expansion.

RATING: 8.5
This is the perfect game to put you between a regular miniature game and a board game. The mechanics are simple to learn and the setup of the missions is a breeze. The theme works well for me (I am a big fan of the "Bloodrayne" style of storyline) and my family loves the idea of endless zombies overrunning other units. For someone that is not into heavy miniature games, this is the perfect gateway to that world. The other two games I would compare this one to directly would be "Space Hulk" and "Tannhauser", but I do like the rule set on this one really good. Two sets make for a very interesting and rich experience, as the boards are designed to match on one end, making it possible to create large scenarios. I would heavily suggest to get an extra copy of the game once you have tried and enjoyed a single one, as this would greatly increase the intensity of your missions. To make things even better, I have found out that Grindhouse has great support and are very interested in addressing any queries from people that play the game. I was lucky enough to have Jim Bailey, the designer, to sign my copy (I am local and close to his location). Anyone looking for a light, easy to setup but yet challenging miniatures game should look no further. "Incursion" makes will fulfill all those requirements to your satisfaction. Lastly, if you really like miniatures, they are available to be purchased, improving your experience even more.

This is my favourite "weird war" game. Love the artwork, love the mechanics and it's cheap to buy too. It can become expensive if you decide to buy the admittedly excellent miniatures though.

Downloaded and printed free rules and game pieces. Very spiffy graphics and design. Printed the board tiles onto 110-pound cardstock then mounted them on the sticky side of some cheap vinyl tiles from Menards (a dozen tiles on clearance at 49 cents USD each). An hour or so with a utility knife and I have a heavy duty set of tiles that should hold up for a long time.

After 4 plays, feel this is an excellent game. The named characters give it a personalized feel, more so than a game it is similar to, Space Hulk.Played back-to-back Mission 2 games, and had opposite results using different characters, which promises future replayability.
Ordered the boxed version and SNAFU expansion book June 2011.
Got in on the Kickstarter for the Plastic Head pledge and the Assets book is a great addition to the game. Sorry that the Grindhouse Games duo were so ground down in many ways by the KS, as Incursion is a fantastic game.
Another update (Feb. 4, 2017): Up to 26 logged plays now. Have even made a portable version to play on my lapdesk when I want to sit in my recliner and game. Yes, I am playing solo...

I  really rate this, it is like space hulk but with some excelent overlays which really add to the game. 

The miniatures are amazing, I was lucky enough to back the Kickstarter, which means I now have a shed load of minis and a tonne of campaigns. 

One of the key differences to space hulk is the lack of jigsaw puzzle board tiles. This is good as you can always tell how big a game will be.

After playing this I don't want to play Space Hulk ever again. Does everything SH does and then some! Oh, and it's half the price and size too!

RATING: 9.5
Really nice game that resembles a lot of Space Hulk. I do not know which is better and that is giving Incursion a really good grade as Space Hulk has been one of my top five games ever.
I love the approach of introducing cardboard figures which makes it a cheap but still playable with theme much game. Compared to other games in the same genre that more or less requires some painting to be done before playing.
That said I will definitely purchase and paint miniatures to this game sometime in future.
...
OK so now I have gone and purchased the miniature starter packs for each faction, yay! Now its only a question to start painting.

Played this for the first time yesterday.  We tripped up a couple of times on the rules for the battle cards, but that's because we were tired.  The rules are pretty simple for a miniatures game, and capture the flavor of the theme quite well.

I've never played Space Hulk properly on a tabletop, but I've played computer versions of the board game.  This feels similar in mechanics, but it's very much its own game.  The lack of blip counters and the relative weakness of the zombies' hand-to-hand attacks (compared to the deadly claws of the Genestealer) makes close combat a little more even between the two sides, and the special characters and non-zombie units for the Germans give them some options that the Genestealers don't get in the basic Space Hulk game.

Worth the purchase, especially at the ridiculously low prices they've been at for the sale.

If you enjoy games that absolutely reek theme this game will be right up your dark, claustrophobic alley.  So far I have only played the first mission but found the game to be engaging and the scenario seemed fairly balanced.  After a turn or two you get a sense for the importance of turn order.  The bidding mechanism and action point mechanism dovetail together to enable you to really have to make some interesting decisions.  Go first or have more points to spend...  I am eager to get this to the table again soon.  The art is great and I love the back story and how it helps create a wonderful atmospheric ambiance for the game.  Apparently the first printing had some laminate issues so be careful punching your pieces - you will likely need the aid of an Xacto knife or similar.

I am REALLY looking forward to this game.  As a student of WW2 as well as alternate realities and comic books, this one is PERFECT for me. It comes with cardboard stand-ups in the base game, but the deluxe has some pretty sweet metal miniatures just begging to be painted up in WW2 colors. Zombies, Robots, Powersuits, Nazis- what else could you want? 
Go ahead- buy it! Wanna live forever!? 
Rating based on pre-released material- will adjust after the game arrives.

Need to play more of the missions before rating this one. The first mission in particular seems to have some balance issues. Reminds me of Space Hulk, but I like this more because it has Nazi zombies.

Update: After playing the first mission again and having the Germans win, I will say it can be done (though it is still an uphill battle). Played the second and was extremely close and fun. Great game. Now if I can just get my hands on the expansion...

 the 'Space Hulk' killer we were all hoping for!

Jim of GrindHouse basically burned himself out to ensure his backers got a fully loaded Game, with all the the rewards promised, and How!!

Sadly, production road bumps (which come down to inexperience with dealing with overseas manufacture, I believe), drove the profit margin so slim that this Outstanding Game will likely never be known outside its small circle of impassioned devotee's. 

Pity, that!

If ever there was an election to promote a little-known game 
that deserved to be put into the general consensus of 'Grail' category, 
well: this would get my vote.

Verdict: Rousing Success (...but at too high a cost to the publisher)

I was an early backer of this one,
right around the time the metal minis started production
(and I have the limited edition tins to prove it).

This one does all the things that 1st ed Space Hulk promised,
and that 2nd, (3rd...4th....) ed seemed to forget about.

I like it better than Space Hulk (which I have played at least 100 times over the last 15 years.  Doom is not even a close third.  The card deck makes this less of a optimization puzzle (see Space Hulk) and more of a game.

Borrowed this from Matt and had a bash. It's a reasonably good two player strategy game but the theme is not my favourite and once we'd played the first few missions I wasn't overly keen on repeating them or advancing to later ones. I'm not really turned on by sexy Nazis but that's no fault of the game.

Not bad, but I prefer the claustrophobia that Space Hulk conveys. Walking down corridors crab style, or getting bottlenecking yourself with the amount of enemies spawned seems a little untested.

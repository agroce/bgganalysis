Fun abstract game, that plays well with 2, 3 or 4 and teams of 2.  Very quick to teach and everybody that played it enjoyed it.  Now there will be a new upgraded version and I'll have to buy that.  Thanks a lot FFG.

RATING: 6
A puzzle tile laying game.  There is a lot of strategy to it, but I did feel like there were a lot of times where luck of the draw has more impact than making good plays.  If you only get one tile at a time of a particular shape/color, it is very hard to earn points in that color.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Pure abstract with excellent components and very good scalability (1-4).

Another need to win by having the highest total of your lowest scores like in Tigris & Euphrates, but of course the actual gameplay is completely different.  Seems kind of like a more strategic Blokus- you can block other players and set up good areas for yourself.  This game really works because it has some depth, it's very easy to learn and jump in and play, and you can even play it by yourself!  I'm not normally a fan of pure abstracts, but this is a solid title.

One of the best abstract games.

2016-03-24
The secret of Ingenious lies in its scoring system. You cannot concentrate on one thing only, and this makes the game very interesting, since even if one player scored a ridiculous amount of points in category, s/he might still not win the game. Moreover, the accumulation of big scoring chances create a natural dramatic arc to the game with a lot of tension and big climaxes. 

The game scales well to varying player numbers and playing time is just right. Of course, with more players the game tends to become more chaotic but not to degree that it makes the game meaningless.

This game works great as a gateway game with adults.  The rules are simple and quickly explained.  Everyone I have played this with really enjoyed it.  I have introduced it to co-workers and my gaming group with excellent results.

My 9 year old daughter enjoys playing this game.  My 7 year old is a bit reluctant to play.  But, this is a game even my wife enjoys on occassion.

The bits are fine.  I did replace the cloth bag with a larger one.  The placement of the pieces can be a bit tricky because the board is not groved at all.  But all that is very minor and does not detract from game play.

Plays just as well with 2, 3, 4 or teams.  I like it best with teams or 2.

Another winner from the good doctor!  Dominoes with T&E scoring.  Simple, fun, great!  They only way to win (or not lose!) is to watch what colors are becoming close to being blocked off and exploit it for good or evil.

Update: Downgraded to a 7.  After getting a score of 17 in a 4-player game, I just don't look forward to playing this anymore...

Update: Re-upgraded to an 8.  I can't stay mad at this game...

Our first "non-traditional" abstract strategy game. Unfortunately, the tiles are not of such a good quality, the symbols on them are already starting to wear down.

It is very strategic played as a 2-player game, but can become kinda of chaotic when played with more. Still, it's a great game.

I'm not a huge fan of true abstract games but this one is an exception. It's very simple to teach and learn. The game play is fairly straight forward with just enough thought needed to make it interesting but not enough that it will scare people away. It plays pretty quickly as well. Solid game that plays well with kids, nongamers and gamers. Just remember to play some defense!

I picked this great little game up at a post-holiday game sale for $18. This is a great Knizia offering which sports beautiful tiles and a clever scoring mechanism similar to that of Tigris and Euphrates. The game has proved easy enough and quick enough for my friends and family to enjoy while retaining enough interesting decisions to ensure that I am having a fun time as well.

Great game, I wish I had more plays of it and will definitely try to increase these over the summer.

The best abstract out there! And the only multi-player abstract I've ever REALLY loved! I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but........this is an abstract with multiple paths to victory!

RATING: 8
Don't get me wrong, it's a good game...but not my favorite.  A little too dry/abstract, and the bits aren't the prettiest in the world.  And with 4, you can't plan things out too far (esp. if you are the only one trying to block others...it can get frustrating).  Hell, a plastic board with raised portions to keep the tiles from sliding may be enough to raise my rating a point or so.

So yeah...while it IS a good game, the parakeet in me wants better bits/board.

This is a very fun abstract game that always leaves me asking for more.  The gameplay is very tight and you have to make some important decisions (like when to block a color off to stop scoring on it) and it keeps you on your toes the whole game.

It was the 1st meeting of the Ark-La-Tex Gamers Association at Barnes & Noble Bookstore.  The rest of the gang hadn't arrived yet and some boys were talking about trying to find a game to play.  I suggested that they join me for a game of Ingenious.  Well, they all turned me down except one of the youngest ones.  He and I played a 2 player game and as we began to play not only his brothers and cousins started helping him learn the game but, his mother became interested as well.  By the time that he and I had finished our game the rest of the family wanted to play.  So, we played a 2nd game, only this time it was my young apponent and one of his cousins or brothers as one team, two of the other boys as a 2nd team, his parents as a 3rd team and myself and even though I won my first game one of the boys teams managed to win the 2nd game creating quite a bit of interest in the game of Ingenious.Soon after that Chris, one of our members arrived and he and I engaged in a 2 player game.  Chris had also played Ingenious before but I managed to beat him just the same.

{1 play, 4 player} The genius of this Knizia abstract is that it doesn't feel like an abstract.  Perhaps, as Mark Johnson pointed out, because you're drawing tiles so there isn't perfect information.  I worry a little that your best move is just to maximize your score rather than be tactical (or strategic, or whatever the correct word is here), but it's still a fun ride.

Once you learn that the game is about being defensive, you excel.  Is really only meant to be played 2P.  With 3-4P you can have 3 pieces that start AND stop a key color before you have a chance.

Very nifty.  The victory condition makes the game really interesting.

My only gripe would be that it can be very hard to do well if you keep drawing a poor tile for a color you need.  It's really hard to get some tiles a good use, and if you get enough of them, you'll be playing at a disadvantage.  Not really enough of a concern for this game to be considered anything but good, however.

Harkened by some as Knizia's Dominoes.  It can be viewed as such, or as a tile placement and majorities games.  Utilizes a (now) typical Knizia-esque scoring mechanism of Highest value in minor holding.  Good game worth playing.  Plays well with 2, 3, or 4.  [GTI Code: APSD]

6/11/16: Played teams with 4 players for the first time and it was a lot of fun.  I think that in the future I'd recommend going team play whenever there's four.  

2009: Rating is for playing with adults.  Would rate this 8 for playing with kids or as a family game.  This seems to get played a lot, mostly with children.  I enjoy this game but I have several friends who are smarter and more mathamatically oriented than me who are very impressed with this game.  I have yet to ascend to that plane of existence.  This is a good game to play with children.  My 9 year old niece enjoys it, but has not figured out to optimize her moves.

Recently I seem to be winning quite a bit, but can't explain my strategy other than I try to balance the scores of the colors.

2008: So far I've only played this online against AIs (and once at BSW) so I can't say how much I'd enjoy it against real live people. Definitely my sort of game though, there's enough luck to even things out a little and strategy enough to require thought.

2012: After a game in which I taught the other three most of how to play (one had been reading rules) I do enjoy this and will gladly play a game or two when it gets taken along to game events I'm at.

Simple and fun, and uses the "work with the pieces you have" mentality of Tigris and Euphrates.  I do wish that the beginning of the game was a bit more interesting; it's sort of just there to shape the board.  Second half of the game is far more interesting than the first, with players rushing to move up their weakest colors or score an "ingenious."

The ultimate abstract game.

Nic Knizia game.  SdJ material?  No, just not enough substance for that class of recognition.

RATING: 10
So simple.  This is a classic 'Why didn't I think of that first' type game.  Of course Reiner spends more time thinking of games than any one of the rest of us have waking hours, so I guess it was always likely that he would be the one to 'discover' this game.  The world is a better place for the good doctor's existence.  This has now even surpassed Lost Cities as my favourite 'small' Knizia game.

A very small moan.  You can get stuffed if you can't get one particular colour of tile.  Yes, you can replenish if you don't have that colour, but that doesn't guarantee you get the colour you want.  May introduce a house rule to allow further refreshing if you still don't pick the required colour.

There is some luck involved which is great, but also a good amount of strategy.

My favourite abstract.  I'll play this solo, or with two, three or four.  I enjoy playing teams.  I love Ingenious!

I prefer it on BSW over f2f stictly due to pieces sliding on the game board and having an overhead view, but I still really enjoy it f2f.

Highly recommended.

RATING: 5
A light abstract, attractive, and with interesting play. A scoring mechanism similar to Tigris and Euphrates except with revealed scores. The game is not as deep as Blokus, were planning several moves ahead is required. Ingenious in multiplayer seems to require little thought to play, as all colors are typically available since it doesn't pay to block rather than maximize points. Either I'm missing something or this game should only be played 2 player or 4 player partnership. I've traded my copy away and kept Blokus.

RATING: 8
Very simple game with domino like pieces.  Players take turns laying down colored dominoes that are used to accumulate points of a certain color where lines are made.  Because it's a Reiner Knizia game the lowest color that you score in is your overall score.  So you really have to manage your scoring well.  This also allows other players to try and block off the one color that you need.  Very fun and quick game.

Having played a two and three player game, this one is pretty good.  The two games were surprisingly different from each other.

Abstract that reminded me of Exago in layout with Tigris & Euphrates scoring mechanism. Clever abstract that can get very bogged down with AP. Timer is essential but arguably a minute per turn is still way too much.

Time passes and further games don't really reveal much beneath the surface of this one. There are standard tactics to prevent opponants scoring unnecessarily but big scores will come from drawing the right tiles. Not a very challenging experience, down graded to a 6 and put on my trade list. Sold May 2014.

People who hate abstract games will love this one. Even after they realize it doesn't get any higher on the abstract scale. They will walk round and say things as "hey, I love this, and I don't even like abstracts". And buy it for all their friends at the first opportunity. Yes, it's a Knizia that doesn't even pretend to have a theme. And suddenly we don't have to bicker about the gloss and chrome and judge it for what it is. And conclude it does exactly what it says on the tin.

The general idea of incremental scoring as more tiles are added to the sequence is certainly not a new one. "Domikant" and "Blokus" are only the first two of a long list of games I have played that immediately jump up and shout for attention. I am sure that there are game-magazines the world over that have presented cut-out games for their readership based on a similar principle. Yet somehow they weren't loud or convincing enough, as none of those similar-ish games gave me this instant way-up-there feeling. Was ditching the square tiles for hexagonal ones really all it took?

In all likelihood it is the first commandment on the rules-tablet that the good Doktor has given to the gaming world, that is the real reason why this game stands out from a colourful crowd: "your end score is the score for the element you are doing worst in". Suddenly attack and defence, and a natural necessity to balance your own play all become integral part of each strategy, triggering a whole new layer of plausible counter-moves to each situation. Handing people the teasing option to trigger bonus-moves for reaching the end of the scoring track in each colour is another simple way to add new layers of complexity with a simple concept, and possibly also a deadly trap for people who forget it's the bottom end on your plank that matters most and overdose on it.    

I yet have to find a flaw with this one. It is hellishly addictive, plays fast and exceptionally well with 2,3 and 4 players, both solo and in teams. People will grasp the rules (does that have an "s" at the end?) instinctively and there are a billion gazillion ways to get the tiles on the board and win. Even more to lose. There is an online version which has people up at all hours of the day and night, willing to give it a go. And Kosmos even made a shock-resistant travel edition. Another highly attractive feature is that the general gaming ability levels between players don't seem to matter as much, as people who normally shun stronger opponents quite happily sit down against normally intimidating opposition, forgetting they are eagerly sitting down for what was firmly defined as their worst gaming nightmare. Face it, if it could make breakfast I would marry it.

The only thing that could possibly improve it, is barring a certain BrettSpielWelt player from Thailand aggressively interfering with his team mate's moves and concentrate on his own placement.

I am curious if in time this will become another 10 in my list. For that it will need to keep me under its spell for quite a while longer. I suspect it will keep us easily engrossed for as long as it takes. It is, in one word, ... (resist, resist, you-know-better, no, darn, I caved)... Ingenious!

UPDATE: after a few times with 3 players I have changed my mind about suitability for 3, and decided not to play it that way any more. It seems that in a 3-player game too often 1 player gets shut out, usually because the other two have compatible opening hands, which seems to result in a tandem runaway team against one player, whose weakest colour is too easy to shut out. As a 2 or 4 player game it still takes some beating! One of the few games that is a steady climber on my list (8.5>9>9.5). The 3-player problem would normally slash it to a 9 tops, but few games are as intuitive to play as this, for gamers and non-gamers alike, simultaneously. And that more than makes up for its only flaw.

I traded this game (the German version), then rebought it (English version).  I like the English box better, weirdly enough.  As for the game... Pure genius.  A very abstract game, and not as pretty as Ta Yu, but it'll tide me over.  It's probably a more interesting connection/pattern tile-laying game than Ta Yu.  How to score is simple, but where to score is more complex.  The solitaire version is great for a solitaire, but this game is much better played multiplayer.

Oof.  After the barrage of T&E comparisons, I had hoped for so much better.  I now know why scoring in T&E is hidden.  This game is 2/3 luck and 1/3 tactics; control is non existant and strategy impossible when you are at the whims of the tile draws and the abilities of other players to know what you need and prevent it.  One playing only, with 4, but I see no reason to play this clunker again when I could be playing T&E instead.

I like this game, I enjoy this game...  but it's flawed a bit.  

Quite often you're just playing the hand you're dealt as best as you can play it that turn.  In doing so, often your choices are made for you, or you're just making the best of a bad situation more than any long-term strategy or free-form decision making.  The game is playing you.

I hesitate to say "it's all luck", skill will still win-out most of the time, but instead of a multi-player abstractish sort of game...it ends-up being sort of single-player abstractish sort of game.  Because you're all, within a tolerance, getting the same amount of crap per good...  it's just the play experience is one of deciding how to make the best of a situation with a super super limited amount of information available to you.  Your hand of 6 usually has 2-3 pieces that aren't even worth looking at, you don't know what your draws are in the future, and you don't know what the other players are even likely to do.   Just slap it down and hope everything works out for you.

So what I'm saying is that this ends up being kind of 'an exercise' more than a game...but without the flavor needed to turn into 'an experience'.

------------------------

Against the computer pro-tip:  The computer calculates "making the most of a move", so if you shut him down on his lowest value early in the game, he never bothers to remedy that situation.

This is Knizia at his best, in fact I wish he would design more completely abstract games like this.  The game is utterly simple, you just play a tile and score for the colors it matches up with.  The "ingenious" part of the game is that you score each color separately, and your final score is equal to the lowest of your 6 colors.  This forces players to concentrate on diversifying and working in multiple areas at the same time.

There are lots of ways you can play this game.  You can be very competitive and block your opponents at every moment, or you can be semi-cooperative and help expand the color areas hoping that you'll be the one to get the biggest benefit.  There are many opportunities for clever play as well, and you can try multiple strategies to attain victory.  And since all scoring information is open you know where your opponents want to play and can play a very defensive game as well.

As its title states, Ingenious requires the players to put their wits to work: as a result, it’s a simple and entertaining abstract game vaguely playing like Qwirkle, which showed up much later though. [i](April 2012)[/i]

I rarely choose abstracts over other games, but I usually end up enjoying them once I'm playing. This one was just right length (less than an hour), and it was fun. You can play for your own benefit or play to block others. I missed something at the end that cost me the game (and I ended up in last place), but I'll be more careful next time now that I'm aware of the possibility of having all possible scoring locations to a color blocked. The scoring is just like in Tigris and Euphrates, and I played the game the way I do that one, always making a move to score my lowest color. It works for me in T&E, which I almost always win, but it didn't work so well here. I guess it's better to make a high-scoring move on a color you're already strong in, and then you don't have to worry about that color anymore, or you can get it to 18 and get an extra move (I did that twice). I'll play it differently next time.

UPDATE: I actually chose this to play my second time (I don't usually choose abstracts). With 3 players it went pretty fast and made a nice filler. I did much better this time, too, not passing up big-point moves just so I can increase my lowest colors. That works in T&E, but not here. Getting to place the extra tile is a big advantage, giving you more chances at points, as well as enabling you to set up a two-part move.

Like many folks I came into boardgames through a gateway game(Catan).  That meant I had to try things out to find other games I really like.  As it turns out I really don't like abstracts.  Pushing around shapes with zero theme just doesn't do it for me.  That said, if this type of game is your thing you probably can't go wrong with Ingenious.  It's just not my cup of tea is all.  My rating reflects my tastes for the game.  I don't think it's a bad game.  In fact, abstract fans like it a lot.  I just don't think it's a good game for me and my tastes.

Un abtracto con reglas muy básicas. Prácticamente es como un dominó, solo que incluye un sistema de puntuación que hay que ir reflejando con varios contadores. Lo bonito del asunto es que no gana quien más suma al final, sino quien tiene su menor contador más alto que el menor contador del resto de jugadores.

Admite de 1 a 4 jugadores. A mí, personalmente, me gusta bastante, aunque no es del estilo que le suele gustar a los jugones.

Even can play in teams!
Suits all ages too I think. Got beaten by my 8 year old son :)

Good little abstract game that can be played solo as well as with up to 4 people! I really like the fact that your final score is the score of your lowest scoring color as it really makes you focus on working all of the colors rather than one or two. Components are nice and gameplay is easy to understand!

This was definitely more fun than I thought it would be just looking at the board. I'm normally not a fan of abstract games, but Ingenious was ok.

Counting points felt very clunky and awkward but I liked that your ending score is your lowest color score. That mechanic definitely made it interesting.

Typical Knizia masterpiece: very simple rules but complex play. And, this time, he's not even bothered to try and scrape any kind of theme over it; it's a pure abstract, and all the better for it.

RATING: 6
   A nice blend between Blokus and Qwirkle, Ingenious offers families another opportunity to share some time at the table.

   Perhaps the only reason this one is not quite as popular is because of its price.  It is a bit much, comparitively speaking...

I'll be perfectly honest.  There's not much here.  All moves feel pre-destined after a certain point and there's little tension.. even at the end.  It's easy to see the best move, and then you make it.  I believe it gets a high amount of praise because it's easy to grasp.. even for people who don't normally do well at abstracts.  "Easy to grasp" is the best phrase for this one.  Perhaps I should give partners play another shot after enjoying the travel edition so much.

Played once with my wife, and played six more times in the same weekend.  Seeing as we have three small children running around our feet, this is high praise for a game.  We love Einfach Genial.  And I like it just as much with three players, but I have not yet played with four.  I have played this 20+ times, which is an awful lot for me to play one game.

UPDATE 2009:  I would love to drop this down in rating as I rarely ever reach for it myself, but my wife is constantly introducing it to new people, and it's always fun when we play.  The rating stands, though the game feels like just a little more than filler.

I picked this up after playing it for the first time at Gamestorm 9. It's seen the table very often since. Almost everyone likest his game, especially non-gamers. I have one gamer friend who likes to win, and he got creamed by my son's girlfriend recently (so he decided he didn't like it). I think this is a good game, but not great. It's an enjoyable, next generation domino. The scoring mechanism is the same as Tigris & Euphrates where the lowest number of any of the colors being tracked is your final score. This works extremely well in both games.

Ingenious is not strictly my sort of game, since I like theme in general (with the notable exception of the GIPF series). But Ingenious is so undeniably clever, and has such an obvious draw for gamers of almost all stripes, and is also prototypically Knizian in accomplishing so much with so little, it's a game that still sucked me in.

Like many Knizia games, it's fundamentally a risk management game with a heavy dose of tactics. You need to look at the whole board and judge how "available" each color will be going forward, whether you need to jump on a bandwagon now or whether you can wait a little bit while you score smaller numbers of points in colors that may be harder to get in the future.

There really is a lot going on here for such a simple game, and it is very highly recommended for almost anyone.

When playing with 4, I much prefer the team variant to the straight 4-player. The loss of control with 4 individual players seems to hurt a little, but with two teams, you're back in business.

RATING: 8
Dominoes with colors. A good game to teach people who look askance at your "nerd games" (ok, maybe that's just my sister), and to play with people who like heavy abstracts like Go or Chess. They may find the randomness a little annoying, but it adds enough randomness to level the field a bit (though superior play will still win the vast majority of the time).

I just don't get this. It seems very dry and not fun at all. I wonder if I'm playing it wrong . . . 
UPDATE: after a few plays, I think I do get this. But as with Blokus, I just don't seem to "see" the patterns and understand the tactics well enough to beat experienced players (on BSW, e.g.). And it's just enough of an abstract not to thrill this old D&D player . . .

RATING: 8
There's certainly a tension in the space between scoring points and blocking, and when to block and when to score. Noticing when you can likely lock down a colour such that someone can't come back can be brutal, and once lockdowns start happening the game truly is a sword fight in a phonebooth. So keeping an eye on the opponent(s) scores is essential.

RATING: 7
This is kind of a weird one for me. I have fun when I actually sit down but I never want to take it off the shelf.  I've noticed the same problem with some of the other Knizias I own.

I like my abstracts as non-random as possible so this isn't great for me. With two people you get a fair amount of control but with 3 or 4 players the randomness was too much for me.  I'm keeping the rating fairly high because it's easy to teach and most of my game-buddies seem to enjoy it.

This one is very simple but the scoring makes it something special. I'm usually always up for a game. And it scales from 2-4 very nicely.

Appeals to the cutthroat group too - cutting off your opponents is super fun.

Probably one of the best abstracts I have ever played, and I am not a fan of abstracts.  Besides hand management, tile placement, and pattern building, there are also elements of set collection and area control.  In addition, having the lowest-scoring colour establish the final score keeps everyone on their toes until the very end.  A very simple, elegant design.

RATING: 6
Extremely simple to teach and play. Plays fast and has some decision making. A couple of problems. First is that luck of the draw can absolutely screw you, and though the tile replacement rule helps, it seems to not help as much as you would think. 

The other issue is that the writing is often on the wall as to who will win at most 2/3 of the way through the game. Sometimes, with the right tiles, you can come back through an "ingenious" double tile play, but not often. I actually think the early game is far more interesting in how you block off early popular colors and set yourself up for that end game. 

Overall, for the play time and the fact that it can easily be played with anyone, pretty nice.

RATING: 6.5
Never say it's kind of Dominoes (but not really!) as it will turn many people off... It's a pretty good abstract game which scales perfectly well from 2-4 players. The scoring mechanism, taken from Tigris & Euphrates and other games, is great and adds tension because you might have scored max points in a lot of categories, but if your lowest score is e.g. 2, your final score will be 2... 

Sure, you can get screwed this way, but you can also screw others! And if you don't have the tiles of your lowest score, you can switch them with new ones which mitigates the luck of the draw. I think it's yet a pretty good game made by Knizia - some might even say it's an ingenious design... (Sorry for the terrible pun!)

It isn't the hit Blokus has been with my students, but it is a ton of fun and the 'lowest score in a category is your score' conditions is brilliant.

My criterion for rating games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: Not much difference from game to game. This is why abstracts are rated so lowly by me. Not enough variation from game to game.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. Lots of decisions on where to place tiles to score ingenious, but also to keep low colors moving up.

3) Player interaction: A good amount of interaction as players look to build on what their opponent's play to build large rows off of them and also prevent them from getting their low colors up in score.

4) Components/artwork: Good components for an abstract. Pretty lousy artwork, but I enjoy the components.

5) Game length/complexity: Perfect time and complexity for what it is. Can knock out several games in an hour with a party game crowd.

This game is a winner, even if I am not - I am not very good at it, but it won't stop me from playing.  A very enjoyable puzzle game, and with 4 players, the spots can become very competitive.  Overall, an excellent game, and since I haven't played Tigres & Euphrates, I would have to consider this to be one of Knizia's best.

Another great Knizia game.  I know that some have criticized RK for rehashing the same theme over and over, just pasted onto a different box.  Well, I own only 4 of his games (and will most likely add T&E as a 5th), and none of them are the same at all.  I guess if you don't buy all 250+ of his games, the "repitition" factor is diminished.

Abstract, but the game is attractive, easy to learn, plays fast and is unusually enjoyable (at least to me, and normally I hate abstract games); plays well with different numbers of players, too.

Ingenious is an abstract game that my wife and I have played to death! With more than 70 plays, I can safely say "we got our money's worth."

With Ingenious, players are in turn placing double-hex-shaped pieces in six different colors, scoring based on how many of the matching color are in proximity. Players track their progress in the six colors, but the winner is the player who does best in their worst color, which forces players to diversify.

To be honest, the reason we played this game so much is because my wife was reluctant to try new titles, which is no longer the case. But it's interesting to consider a game that we've played with such frequency. I can honestly say that Ingenious has held up fairly well over such repeat play, as my wife and I learned how to study each other's board, block each other and marginalize scoring opportunities.

One other perk to consider is that Ingenious allows for team play, which I always enjoy. As long as folks are open to an abstract game, this is very solid family-weight gaming.

Overly tactical abstract with a flacid, directionless opening, monotone midgame focused on balanced development and opportunistic hand management, and an endgame dedicated to aggressive containment.

I love playing this quick, fun, abstract.  Something about the tactile nature of laying the tiles and building up runs of colors is really satisfying.  Also, the fact it scales fairly well for different players (I like two best, though), is also very nice.  It's a quick game, and is among my favorite for two.

Nicknamed "the mold-growing game" among my friends for the colorful organic patterns it produces, Ingenious is quite delightful. It has two central flaws, neither of which really impede the fun of playing it, but both of which reduce its overall strategic complexity. First, the rules as stated clearly intend for players to grow their scores in a balanced way, making sure not to focus on any one color too much compared to the others - but in reality, getting one Ingenious by filling a color track up typically makes it a lot easier to get more, leading to a snowball effect that rewards acting against the intent of the rules. Second, despite the name, this game is actually very easy if you have a good grasp of how scores are counted, since there is almost always an optimal move, and it's generally pretty obvious what that move is.

All in all, a very good game with a little bit of pretentiousness in it's theming that overshadows some of its gameplay strengths.

I've only played online so my comments may not be fully fair...

I enjoyed it very much.  It has similar attributes of Tigris and Euphrates (which a favourite game) with the tile laying/swaping and final scoring.  It is a good game, but it feels mechanical...like each turn players just look for their optimal move.  If you are desperate for a certain colour you are at the mercy of a tile swap to get what you need.  All in all, it is addictive and interesting.

Its nice for there to be a fun Knizia game that his critics can't whine about having a pasted on theme. Here, there is NO theme. Its a fun multiplayer abstract. 

Ingenious plays quickly, offers some real decisions, and is intuitive to play. I hadn't bothered to try this one for far too long. This is a great game that kind of snuck in under the radar for me. 

This is in the same vein as Blokus, except that it is uniquely kniziesque. The scoring, the tile refreshing, it just feels like he designed it. I haven't tried, but look forward to trying it as a partnership game, too.

RATING: 7
Basically take a Euphrat style scoring system, and then graft it onto a pure abstract tile laying game that rewards getting long rows of a given colour while simultaneously shutting off your opponents from the same colour when at all possible. Of the Knizia tile laying games that I've played I would rank this only behind Euphrat (Euphrat is just much deeper with its conflict rules) but certainly in front of both Durch and Samurai. This is just as accessible as Durch, but more interesting because of the need to go after different types of points continuously instead of just grabbing the most obvious big score that is left on the board.

All of that said, I had a copy of this but then got rid of it because it was nothing I was ever volunteering for the table. With 3-4 players I would rather play Euphrat, with 2 there are a plethora of fine abstract options (i.e.: Insert GIPF project game here).

My opponent also seemed to think highly of it He may post a session report (look for Norbert Chan if your interested). I'm really thinking I must start to us 6.5, 7.5 and so on because I think this game should or could be a 7.5 but I'll wait till I do them all at once. It will be more objective that way.

Great abstract.  The winning condition of "Highest low" sounds confusing but is really simple.

Fun for the entire family.  This game is playable by anyone 6 years or older and is not language dependant.  As of 03-2008 BSW Plays against human are logged as plays

Genius is a simple tile-laying game with a curious option to play it against yourself. The scoring mechanism seems straightforward, but you have to take into account that if you score a lot of points, a player after you might score even more. Luck seems to have a large influence despite the rule which allows you to exchange the tiles in your hand for new ones, but the game is over quickly enough for it to be too big of a problem. It plays smoothly with any number of players and has a pleasing one-more-go appeal, but it misses character. Not a bad abstract, but not spectacular either.

[b]Update[/b] The game gets better if players become more creative in laying down blocking tiles, thus hindring subsequent 'leeching'. Still not a great fan of it, though, as it lacks agression.

This fiercely addictive game is so easy to learn and plays in a short amount of time.  Perfect for families of all ages.

Players place 2-part tiles which feature symbols in 6 colors.  You score points for each color the new tile touches that matches, as far out in a straight line as possible, and in every direction.  The twist?  Your final score is for whichever color has the lowest value at game's end - so you have to spread out across the board.

Great little game that I'd play anytime.

Components: Sturdy plastic tiles, and a simple yet attractive board. The patterns could be more appealing, but they are at least functional. The travel edition is too small.

Experience: Very simple game, but with opportunity to play both defensively and offensively. I don't see much long-term strategy in this: I score the most points I can each turn (rather than sacrificing points on one turn to set up for a big score on a subsequent turn). It's fun trying to manage all six colors, caring about the stragglers, but also trying to max-out a color for the extra turn.

Fun take on a dominoes-style game.  Can be played friendly, trying to maximize your points while letting others score as well, or can be played very defensively, blocking opponents' access to certain colors or areas.

Received in trade (for Puerto Rico).

Knizia goes Dominoes. The fun thing about the 2player game is that it seems more about blocking your opponent then scoring points for yourself. A little bit expensive for some easy rules and not too overwhelming components, but it may appeal to all kinds of players. It looks easy and may be luck-driven, plays quite fast and has quite some depth.

Played a few games which were a lot of fun. I like Knizia's way of scoring, where your weakest colour determines the victory, as is the case with Tigris & Euphrate. Not his best game, but a decent abstract filler.

A very good abstract game and that's saying something coming from me - I normally don't like abstracts.  Easily teachable to non-gamers and plays very nicely with two player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Loads to think about and little strategies to employ: it's beneficial to play an identical tile after one already done and so using a tile you have two of in a starting hand seems sensible.

Checking your opponents' score gives you an idea of which shapes you should block of and which are fine to leave open. And which you need to catch up on.

In the end-game, playing is mainly a matter of scoring as many points as possible but about 1/3 of the way in, there's enough of a 'spread' in the players' points to inform some strategies relating to their relative value.

You need to consider the spaces available and the option of 'killing' a space by only leaving lone hexagons, as well as the 'ingenious' move.

The random elements keep the game relatively light and exciting.

I could imagine enjoying playing this over and over for hours and hours.

Score points on 6 differently coloured tracks by placing double hexagon tiles on a hexagonal game board. The points are counted along the radius of the 5 free sides of each one of the 2 hexagons of the double hexagon tile you place. The points are equal to the number of hexagons showing the same colour/symbol in a straight line from the hexagon you placed. Your final score is your worst score among the 6 differently coloured tracks.

RATING: 7
Take Knizia's beloved maxmin scoring mechanism and distil it into its purest form: remove any pasted on theme, any dynamic element (such as battles in Tigris & Euphrates), any diversely valued tile (such in Samurai). Add a costless mechanism to try and even out the (un)luck of the draw. Throw in a couple of variants (solitaire and  4 players/2 teams) for added value. 
There you have Ingenious, a fun, fast, simple yet deep sort of "geometrical scrabble" heavy-filler game, which scales pretty well 2-4.

Maybe not enough complex to reach the god/demigod status, yet as close to it as it is possible.

(N players: 3>4=2, when played with standard rules. Very good when using both the solo and 2 teams variants)

RATING: 7
Played this a lot with family & friends. Can just turn into a race of rack up as many points as possible without really interacting with the other players i.e. there's a big patch of blue, I'll just add to it to get more, followed by the next player etc. I now play to close off the colours I think I have enough off - it doesn't appear to enhance my chances of winning but it does piss the person to my left off something rotten.

This abstract uses the scoring system from Euphrates & Tigris, as an entire game, basically. The player selects a tile from their "scrabble tray" which displays a pair of colored symbols and then places it, on the hex board, adjacent to a color that matches one of the pair. Scoring is based on the matching symbols that surround it. Players are scored at the end, based on their lowest scoring color. The player that ranks the highest, wins. Very simple to teach and play.

Put me in the "I don't like abstracts, but I like this game" camp. Highly tactical game. Excellent game for 2; 4-player partnership also works well. It moves quickly and it manages to avoid analysis paralysis. Can also be played with kids, which is a plus. UPDATE: rating increased from 8 to 9 after dozens more plays. This one really hits a sweet spot: it's quick, challenging, but not overly taxing.

I don't quite share the enthusiasm for this game that the people around me seem to posses. It's pretty chaotic and you never have the control you want, but on the other hand it has a touch of Knizia's genius in the scoring mechanism that gives you the constant tension of having it all to do. So, an alright game, but not something I'd crave to play.

I'm not sure what to think abou this game.  After one play, we felt it might be a better game for 2 players as opposed to 4.  Otherwise it comes down to who is willing to sacrifice his position to block.  That person who makes the sacrifice is unlikely to win.  Very difficult to make a block and a good play with one move.   Our game saw everyone advancing their own position up until the end..at which point we were assigned "blocking duties".  It would be tough to convince me to play this again unless as a 2er game.

RATING: 8
Rating up a notch from 8.  Elegant abstract tile laying game.  Players alternate playing domino-like double-hexagon tiles onto a playing area.  Each tile contains one or two symbols which score points for lines of matching symbols off the five open hexsides at each end of the tile.  There are six different symbols to worry about.  Final score is the points earned in the lowest symbol and highest "lowest" wins.  Excellent game that doesn't tax the brain too much due to limited hand size and very clear board layout.  Playes well with two, three or four players.  Recommended.

A fun abstract, my family loves this one, especially my mom as she wins at it more frequently than other games.  I really like the scoring method, which requires you to work on all colours evenly, but rewards you  with an extra turn for a high score in a specific colour.  I appreciate that symbols were included along with the colours for colourblind gamers.  easy to teach and scales well from 2 to 4.

One of the few abstract strategy games we've kept after playing, it's easy to teach and learn, but involves a lot of thinking during the game.

Ingenious is similiar to Dominoes except the game end piece has different colors and shapes instead of numbers. The different shapes is great for gamers who are color blind.

Ingenious has a similiar concept as Eurphates & Tigris where scoring points is concerned. It is by the same game designer.

Ingenious is quite simple to learn and it`s fun even for non-gamers.

I played a few times at the WBC. Some players has a particular way of playing Ingenious. It can be confusing at times. You wonder why they played the piece there. Some people play to block a color in order for others not to score high.

The strategy has a discontinuity in it. It's interesting at the immediate tactical level (how do I score what I want to score and not leave too much open), and it's interesting in the very long strategic level (what should I be concentrating on picking up or blocking). However, medium-term plans are impossible due to lack of knowlege, luck, a surplus of options, and (possibly) multiple players.

Ingenious. Another Knizia keeper.  Plays quickly (especially with a 10-year old who does not suffer from AP.) Enough tile choices to make luck less of a factor. 10-year old rates it a 10. Like it best with four.

Probably one of the most accessible abstract strategy games. You simply place a tile and count up adjacent hexes of the same color in a straight line. The winning condition is also neat in that a player's lowest score in a particular color is their final score and whoever has the highest score wins. This game  works well regardless of the number of players you have available (it can even be played solo). A good gateway game by Reiner Knizia.

This is "Tigris and Euphrates" stripped down to its essential elements.  It's a clever game, and I enjoy it.  Nevertheless, it is weak in comparison to other abstracts, because the luck and hidden information limit the amount of strategy.

Update 3-27-2010 - there is more strategy than appears at first glance; it is subtle.  But I still prefer the many excellent open-information abstracts.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) Just about as abstract as an abstract strategy game can get. This is the hexagonal, colourful cousin of [GAMEID=2394] with a scoring twist that adds a certain amount of strategic decision-making. It's not particularly exciting, but then again, it's not supposed to be. Does what it says on the box.

Ingenious is one of the best abstract games out there, bar none. It scales completely well from 2 to 4 players; and although tile draws are random, the ability to swap out your hand if you're missing your lowest color minimizes the luck aspect. In the early game Ingenious has quite a leisurely feel as everyone tries to set up unbroken chains of colors. Often players will even work together to get an Ingenious in one or two colors. 

But as the board fills up, the game suddenly turns much more cutthroat. Since your score in Ingenious is whatever your lowest color is, you can't afford to focus on one or two (or even three) colors to the detriment of others. And you'll quickly find that if one of your colors is trailing, it can be rather difficult to catch up as your opponents quickly cut off your options. 

The end game is where Ingenious really shines, however. It's a nail-biting experience to be only one or two points ahead of your opponent, trying to figure out how to prevent him from leapfrogging you on the scoring board. Do you play non-connecting colors to deny him points? Or do you try to squeeze a few more points out of your trailing color? Ingenious always gives you lots of options, but you have to be flexible and willing to change gears on the fly if you're going to pull out a win. I love this game.

[b]Update[/b]: Increased rating from an 8 to a 9. I've owned this game for several years, and I never get tired of playing it. Its ability to play equally as well with 2 players as with 3 or 4 puts it in a rare category on BGG.

There's no start or midgame strategy to speak of. It's just hexagonal dominos. Each player gets to make one meaningful decision each game, which, for a 45-60 minute game, is unacceptable.

I wanted to like this, since I’m a fan of abstracts, but sadly it is a poor game. It has two significant flaws:

1. Optimal strategy is relatively easy to see – you simply choose tiles that match your lowest scoring colours, and it is obvious where on the board to place them to gain the most points. It’s like assembling a jigsaw with references on the pieces to tell you where they go. This in itself is dull, but the shallowness of the strategy is badly affected by the tile drawing, which is random. I suspect that most people who play this game play more or less optimal moves (it’s that simple), meaning that victory or defeat is determined by whether you are lucky enough to draw the correct colour. It is entirely possible to go three, four or five rounds without drawing the correct colour, resulting in a loss that was entirely out of your control. This encroachment of a randomising mechanic in to an abstract game renders it deeply tedious. In one game I played, I had all colours but red on the final rank, with red at nine points because I didn’t draw any red tiles. 
2. As with many abstract games that are more than two players (army of frogs is another offender), it has terrible downtime. If you play with someone who neglects to plan ahead when other people are playing their moves, the whole game comes to a tedious, grinding halt while they sit there on their turn and deliberate over which move to play. This is why abstract games should really only be two player games. 

The game also has none of the qualities I expect from a good abstract – flat strategy, no tactical interaction, non-deterministic victory conditions. 

Dull and frustrating.

I love abstract games and this is a good one for multiplayer, just not idea at 2 players. I played 3 times at 2-players and that will be the last time. Scoring becomes too obvious at 2 players, as the game nears the end, there is little suspense because its too obvious what your opponent needs and what you need to win the game. This game requires multiple players to add more variables so almost anything can happen to affect the outcome of the game. 

Update: I'll be reselling this one, it just doesn't meet my collection's standards.

Ingenious is... nice. I find it quick and pleasant, easy to teach and I even picked up a copy for the school game club. But for some reason it also doesn't particularly excite me either. I guess for me it could replace Qwirkle, which I bought for my mother a few years back. But that kind of ringing endorsement won't sell many copies. "Ingenious? Maybe not, but at least it's better than Qwirkle!" So, in the right circumstances, this is downright great. And I'd be happy to play it if someone requested it, but otherwise would not do so myself.

Played 10+ times. Very good 2-4 players. Abstract game for people who don't like abstract games. Feels like a cross between Dominoes and Blokus -- and I like it better than both.

Interesting victory condition. 4 player game is a little chaotic, I have a feeling that perhaps 4 player need to play partnership rules to make it worth playing. This may fall to a 7, but it will still get played a long time from now. [fgn, sellBA]

I suspect my rating is likely to go up as I explore the depths of this wonderful game.  At first impression, I think the object is really to focus on building a point bank to maximize the bonus turns to cascade a few in a row.  The object of this is to pinpoint which of the six colors will be the deciding factor at the end of the game.  The random draws are what is keeping this from working all the time, but I think in a nutshell that is the strategy to use.  Deceptively simple and fun.

This is one of my favorite family games.  I can sit down with almost anyone to play, but there's a nice tension between playing defensively or scoring maximum points and going for ingenious or just playing conservatively.

It took a few games for me to really see how great this one is. At first it seemed like a nice filler, but nothing special. Once you start to see the defensive possibilities and strategize the hand management aspect of the game, it becomes excellent. It plays in less than a half hour, but the Tigris & Euphrates scoring makes the game much more interesting than it might seem at first. Again, leave it to Knizia to add hidden depth to seemingly simplistic components. (and that's a good thing)

RATING: 7
[Tile-laying, Abstract] [4P:6, 4P Partnership:6, 3P:7, 2P:7] Reiner doesn't do abstracts much, but when he does them he does them right. Ingenious is a rather addictive tile-laying game that takes the balanced-scoring mechanism from Euphrat & Tigris and grafts it onto a line-of-symbols-forming system that's surprisingly simple and yet gives more meat to chew on than meets the eye. Toss in a couple of simple rules (a hand dump, plus yelling "Ingenious!" with gusto) and you've got a good middleweight game that's easy to teach and is very accessible. The only thing it really lacks is drama (and it doesn't have the strong tension of the better RK games) which will hurt it in the long run, but I don't think Reiner was explicitly going for that here. I'm thinking he wanted a relaxing, family-oriented casual game, and he nailed it nicely despite the occasional feeling that the game is overstaying its welcome when playing 4P with players take several minutes to move. Fantasy Flight's top-notch production values, from the plastic tiles, large board and Scrabble-style tile racks make this a damned good package. If you have space on your shelf for an abstract, this is as good a choice for up to 4 players as you can get.

Played this today (1-22-2012) with Mr. Billington and *won* this time, for the first time in a very very long while.  For this game we used the 3-player board limitation and score-wise it was *very* close (I think I won by 2 points).  Played another game of this today (4-7-2012) with Mr. Billington and I won (by 1 point).  *Very* close game.  We're finding that the 3-played limit (on the board) is better for a 2-player game.  The 2-player limit is a bit too hard for us, and the 4-played limit is too easy for us.  Now I need to go and fix the box (it has some serious splits along two edges).

I love this game.  It has a domino-esque simplicity, with strategy out the wazoo.  You get points for making lines of the same color which radiate from dual-hexagon-shaped pieces you place each turn.  The longer the line, the more points.  The twist:  Your score is equal to the color of which you have the LEAST.  So you are constantly trying to bring up your low scores.  It's really a blast to play, and beautiful to look at.  I only wish the board had raised hexagon shapes in the middle of each space to help hold the bits in place.

Jogo abstrato onde devemos colocar peças no formato de dois hexágonos grudados. Cada uma com um círculo colorido no centro de cada hexágono. Ao se colocar as peças no tabuleiro se ela encostar em outras peças com círculos da mesma cor você pontua nessa cor. É importante ter uma pontuação equilibrada entre as cores pois você  vence, ou perde, pela pontuação da cor que você tem menos ponto. Genial. Recomendo!

I love Yinsh and this is similar kinda but with capacity for more players. Dislikes: Genial is not as beautiful as it could be and has no theme to speak of. Abstract which i enjoy just fine. Functional rather than beautiful. Fast 20 minute games and easy to play for anyone. slight learning curve. I wish there was varients to the game as solving the same goal game after game could wear thin. But then again Go and Chess havent worn out their welcome.

Great family game. We tend to play this when the extended family come to visit. 
The pegs can be a little fiddly, especially with a new board.
The scoring scheme takes a couple of goes to get the hang of and is best learned by seeing a few examples.
Sometimes play with the house-rule that says a player can only retrieve one new tile from the bag per turn. That way a player who gets to the end of the track will have an extra go but will play the remainder of the game with one fewer tile.
Buy if you want a fun game that the whole family can play

Y'know, I don't usually like abstracts but I like this little game.  It really is just Euro dominoes with a tweaked funky scoring system the mad Doktor seems so crazy about, but that tweaked system actually makes the game more interesting with more ways to score, and more to worry about than just maxing one score.

Not going to play it all the time, but if I have to play an abstract, either this or Travel Blokus will do nicely.

A great, quite simple and colourful abstract from Reiner Knizia.  Quick and easy to play, this game offers enough of a challenge, while keeping the AP factor down.  There's more to this game than meets the eye, and the way you play the beginning of the game is quite different from the endgame.  Once the players have figured out how to play a balanced game of capitalizing and blocking, Ingenious really shines!

I played a lot of Ingenious solitaire when I first got it, trying to figure out how to play best. After many plays I discovered I was using the wrong rules, which is pretty embarrassing given that there aren't that many rules in the first place. I still play solitaire occasionally trying to figure out what the best strategy might be.

Multi-player is a very different game as you're trying not to set everybody else up. As far as I can tell you find one colour you've done well in and most other people haven't, and try to close that colour down. Closing a colour down is difficult as there can be many tentacles to score on and you can't do all of them at the same time as well as scoring for yourself. 

I find the game to be an interesting solitaire puzzle, but there's an awful lot of player chaos in a multi-player game and it doesn't really engage me. It is however easy to teach and so is a good game for newbies.

This is really a versatile game!  Scales 2-4 perfectly, playing time about right, suitable for virtually all ages, and can be taught in 5 minutes.  Excellent box and components, and the uniquely colored shape symbols makes the game color-blind friendly.  The only improvement I add to playing the game is the use of a large draw bag rather than the one provided which is too small.

After a bunch of plays, I have lost interest in this one.  There are more entertaining four player abstracts so I sold Ingenious to a member of my game group.

RATING: 8
This is a very fun area majority type game, where players are trying to score all the different colors equally, because your lowest scoring color at game end is your total score. You gain points in the colors by lining up rows of the same colors. There's a little more to it than that, but that's pretty much the basics of the game.

The components are very well made and look great. Even the tile racks are very thick a sturdy.

This is a good family game and most gamers would enjoy a game or two as well.

Initial Rating: 5 -> 6

Ingenious is a tile-laying game of matching patterns and positioning your tiles in order to maximize your points, while still minimizing your opponents possible gain by blocking key tiles.

You score points in six different colors during the game, and every move you do gets you points in 0, 1 or 2 different colors. The amount of points you get for each tile depends on how large the color pattern was on the board before you put your tile there. Essentially, a big preexisting red pattern will get you lots of red points. If your tile is not adjacent to any preexisting pattern, you get no points.

The goal of the game is to collect sets of all six colors. This means that if you have 2 of one color and 10 in all the other five colors, you have only collected two complete sets.

In general you want to maximize the number of points you get for every tile you put on the board, but herein lies a trap. If you don't bite the bullet once in a while and skip the high points to score a few points in your weak colors, you will find that your opponent will block all access to that color for the rest of the game. For a beginner, this is the hard part of the game: Figuring out that you are losing by having too many points.

Because of how the scoring works, you generally want to play after your opponent because wherever he plays, there is now a good chance that he has made a good-scoring area into a great-scoring area. Of course, sometimes this is a feint, and you should try to find the area on the board that your opponent is trying to distract you from. 

Sometimes you will find yourself in a position where you really need a certain tile before that color is completely blocked off. But since you don't have it in hand, you distract your opponent somewhere else by giving him something shiny to look at, and hopefully you will draw the right tile for your next round.

This is a fairly light game, with a limited number of decisions. It has some small similarities to 'lost cities' where you often hold a number of tiles in your hand just to keep them from your opponent, or to wait for a better time to use them. There are some considerations on what color to score when, based on how many tiles has entered the games of a certain color and so on. But it is mostly a relaxing kind of game that you can play quick and breezy. The reliance on the tile draw is not insignificant. The better player usually wins as there are some subtle skills to learn, but there will be a number of games that come down to that you simply didn't draw enough of a color.

Now, as a two-player game I think I would rate this a bit lower, but as a four-player partnership game I find it strangely intriguing. For some reason, a game that I find merely ok because of lack of control, becomes more fun when you lose even more control :)

The partnership is very similar to the two-player game, but you play on bigger area and you have an ally that -in theory- will help you win.
How effective this partnership is depends of course on how good you can read each others moves, and anticipate what your partner wants you to do. This usually leads to some interesting post-game discussions, and for me this meta-game makes the original game more interesting as well. Ingenious also gains some points for being one of the few abstract strategy games to be able to play with 4 players.

ingenius really. quite a bit of screwage factor in this one. i love the scoring mechanic and how you can't just focus on one color but you have to balance the points you earn for all the colors. definitely best with two players. it gets too chaotic and certain players become at a disadvantage with more players.

Typical of Knizia, great game play from a minimal set of rules. I think it has a brilliant design: the "highest-lowest" scoring method, borrowed from [gameid=42], encourages players to balance out their scores for the different colors, but then the reward for reaching 18 on individual colors competes with that goal nicely.

Einfach Genial is a good choice for players who don’t mind trying an abstract placement game, but who usually find such games too dry or too intimidating or too intense.  Einfach Genial is none of those things.  The random tile draw and the multiplayer design put this more in the category of a German-style game than a typical “abstract.”  I would think of it as a German spatial placement game that simply lacks a real-world setting or theme.  For me, it scratches the same itch as Ta Yü.  Both are visually appealing, nontaxing, liesurely, and both nicely limit a player's choices to keep them from becoming overwhelmed.  I prefer Ta Yü with two players, and Einfach Genial with the four player partnership rules.

This is an abstract that have seen much play in our game club. I actually don't mind that since I reckon it is a game that has some decent strategy elements and is easy to introduce new gamers to. That said, I've been grown a little tired of it. Maybe it is overplay or maybe it feels a little scripted when you have played it a few times. That means that the replayability is somewhat limited.

Tendency: I don't expect it to go up. Maybe I will lower the rating.

Twenty-six plays. Simple but extremely good bantamweight game by Reiner Knizia which plays well with any number (though I especially like the partnership game). There is a very tricky balance between gathering points for yourself and snuffing the points for your opponents.

For years I believed this game was no better than a 6/10 on the BGG scale for me because I found it to be boring.

Was just introduced to this game on BSW (6/29/2005).  I rather enjoyed it.  Enough strategy to keep you busy, but still light enough that I could see myself playing it as a conversational game.  UPDATE:  Well, I bought the game, so I guess I really was impressed.  :-)    UPDATE:  I'm not sure about the three-player version, since you lose more control of the game state.  However, the two-player game is wonderful.

When I first played this game (back in 2006), I was like, this is stupid. Matching colors?? How boring. Then 3 years later, my girl says to me, "you have to try this game!! It's awesome!!!", but she didn't tell me the title. Instead, she bought the game for me!!

I was apprehensive, but she explained the game and we were off. I don't know what I was missing the first time I tried it, maybe half of left brain, but when I played again with her, fireworks started going off. This is an excellent game!! Tight, mean fight for scoring your colors to come on top. Who's gonna be first? Who's second?? Don't let your colors lag!!! Amazing game. 

I didn't understand the game first time around. But now it's one of my favorites!! Really, really good game!!

A very fun abstract. I especially like the end game scoring with the fewest points in any color. Makes the game far more interesting than if a different scoring system had been used. Playing 4 players is definitely harder to strategize since blocking a single color is much harder to accomplish.

Much better than my initial plays led me to believe. A very good game. My main complaint is that the early game isn't very interesting compared to the middle and late game, where blocking becomes the main focus.

Otro jueguecito de baldosas del incombustible doctor, de tema totalmente abstracto, con este consiguió el "Juego del año en Alemania", se explica en medio minuto y tiene una táctica sutil, se puntua en cada uno de sus colores, pero al final solo cuentan los puntos del color en el que menos puntos tengas, lo que te obliga a diversificar y no poder concentrarte en un solo color, aparte de tener que estar constantemente vigilando a tus adversarios, dentro de la misma categoría encontramos a Jardines de la Alhambra (Die Gärten der Alhambra), pero este le supera con creces, el otro es demasiado sesudo para el tipo de juego que és.Aunque prefiero, por tema y por desarrollo el Samurai.

Bought this one without ever having played it.  What can I say, I'm a Knizia fan... plus it has the balanced scoring rules that I liked about Tigris and Euphrates.

Blocking other players from scoring their low colours is very important in this game.  One of the interesting tradeoffs in this game is whether to block off a long line of a single colour so that the next player can't extend them for easy points, vs. letting it be extended so that you can extend it again in future (presumably because you need them).  Same for "blockading" a group of one colour by playing a completely unrelated tile against the edge of the region (to stop those easy 6-10 point plays that can arise if you don't).

Interesting rules questions: Can you place a tile in the middle of empty space, not connected to any other tiles?  I say yes.  Can you choose not to play a tile at all?  I say no.

This is a nifty little game.  Actually, after playing an online version of it, I wasn't expecting the board and bits to be so large!

I really like this as a gateway game because it can quickly grab a new player but suck them in with the subtlety of strategy.  The open information on scoring allows for some blocking opportunities and screwage.

Speaking of which, I really like the scoring system.  Reminiscent of T&E, it punishes you for forgetting about a particular color.  Especially if you wait until late when the board starts to fill, your opportunities can dwindle quickly if you're not careful.  The 'ingenious' bonus plays are an interesting touch, but in my games so far, I haven't gotten to utilize them a whole lot.

The game is pretty quick to setup and play which is great.  There are a couple minor downsides for me though.  I haven't had the chance to play with more than 2 yet and fear that this will suffer from Wasabi syndrome - where the board is so different from your last turn, it is difficult to formulate any plans or strategy.  I also think it might be like Blokus for me - fun for a while, but not the greatest in the replayability department.

For now though, a very fun game that I'm happy to have!

Einfach Genial:  Another of those quiet relaxing games with hidden depths.  Simple, relaxing, quiet.  Low on the fun factor scale, but super high on the parakeet and satisfaction scales.

3/06:  I truly suck at this game.  I get so into the patterns and the colors I forget to look at the relative scores...

RATING: 8
A colorful, profound, yet deceptively simple abstract. As contentious and equally pure as Othello, but with up to four players. Normally, I don't want to think that hard if I am not playing chess, but this is strangely relaxing...

Update (08/17/10): If there are three-four people with an hour to kill, this makes for a good filler/starter. I may even go out of my way to suggest it, hence upping to a '8'.

As other players have said, the first rounds are just getting out the board and then comes more of the strategy. But even though you can block and play a little different you will still just play to get some of your colors higher. This game can be somewhat fun if you just like to think a little and place some bricks and check the score but if you like strategy or thinking games this is not for you, tic tac toe has more strategy to it ;) I was a little dissapointed with this one..

Classic Knizia scoring (your score is whatever color value is lowest) so you need to focus on all colors.

Knowing when to block is crucial--get the timing down and the results can be quite nasty for your opponent. With four players, try the team-variant. Makes for an interesting and less chaotic game.

Got this as a two player game, but have only played it with three and four so far.  I'm sure it's far more vicious with two.  

This game has TONS of non-gamer appeal and can be pretty nasty if people are playing well.  It's a decent filler and an easy game to teach.  I've played it with my mom, with proto-gamers and with actual gamers and everyone had a good time, and that is really the strength of Ingenious.

Knizia is probably one of the most renown board game designers before the big golden age of board games. The majority of his games are very simple with hard decisions. Ingenious however takes 45 minutes with the end result being, "oh okay". Battleline and Lost Cities has you questioning decisions. Ingenious does not live up to it's name.

My latest phone obsession - this game just sucks you in.  It seems like the digital version is the ideal medium, as you don't have to deal with any of the necessary scoring and bookkeeping and a game can be finished in under 10 minutes.  Still trying to develop a decent strategy though.

Ingenious with two is merely OK, but with three to four it's a rocking little game.  I kind of think of it as Scrabble with colors and the scoring of T&E (how's that for bastardization?).  Play only gets good when people play defensively and use their bonus moves wisely, otherwise it's too chaotic and straightfoward.  Thankfully, most start becoming cutthroat toward the end and the game shines.

It is just nothing special. Yeah it got simple rules, that's elegant. But it is no where close to good abstract games like Zertz, Hive, Blokus.

A fabulously clever abstract game.  I'm pleasantly surprised that no one tried to paste an artificial (and unnecessary) theme onto this one.  As a bonus, it scales from 2 to 4 players very well, and it may be one of the most flexible games in my collection in that you can play it with kids, non-gamers and/or more hard-core gamers.

The kids (ages 9 & 7) both do reasonably well with this one.

Originally learned how to play on http://www.marquand.net/staticpages/index.php?page=ingenious.  The bot player is pretty good.

RATING: 7.1
Pretty enjoyable abstract from Knizia.  The rules are actually pretty straight forward and intuitive.  The components are somewhat questionable though.  The "cubes on a grid" score track leaves a lot to be desired.

The actual game play is a fun balancing act of scoring points and denying points to your opponents.

I might look to picking up the 2 player version someday.

Was on my wish list, but having now since played the physical version of this game, I'm pretty sure i prefer the ipad version for my personal usage. The ipad version doesn't support 4 players, but Im playing this primarily as a two player game with my husband, so the set up and pack down doesn't really make sense when the app is so sleek and easy to travel with. Love the game though - still happy to play 4 player in the flesh though, although I don't think it will make it into our collection currently.

I am an idiot.  I had this game for over a year, read the rules once and didn't fully 'get it'.  So I put it away, but always eyed it with the hope of trying again.  Found the game to play online and it was soooo simple.  So I brought it back out, forced the kids and husband to play and everyone likes it.  I think this is much better than Blokus, although I do like Blokus.  This just requires more thought, with Blokus we tend to put pieces down, hoping they will work for us in the end.   A nice family game.

Einfach Genial is elegant and addictive. It is certainly not the most strategic of games, and there is a significant element of chance, but it has simple rules, plays quickly and it can be very tactical towards the end of a game. I've played most often as a 2-player game, but 4-player games (both the 4 separate player version and the two team version) were just as enjoyable. Like the game itself, the components are simple but attractive. And all this for a price of less than €20 (for the Hungarian version called Genial Connections).

Knizia melds his E & T scoring system into an above average abstract game that I actually enjoyed playing. (I usually don't enjoy abstracts)  As usual with knizia the game boils down to interesting choices and some hand/tile management.  There is always tension over whether it is best on a turn to advance your score or hinder your opponent.   

UPDATE:  Bumped up after another playing.  My wife really liked it as well.

Very nice.  Light, yet requiring thinking and sometimes tough decisions.  Blocking the opponents at carefully selected moments is often crucial.

Best solo score: 34-22-21-21-21-19.

EDIT: The game has worn out for me (21 plays). Maybe I could leave it in my collection but facing so much - and so good - competition on my shelves it would've had a hard time to find its way to the table.

Similiar to Blokus but more to think about here I think and as usual Knizia forces you to play a balanced game which is a "good" thing. Playing with 2 allows you to set yourself up more where as with more it is much more cutthroat, great game with any number and a another perfect weeknight game...

Nice, clever and quick game that makes everyone feel like they can do well at it right from the off, thanks to it's deceptive simplicity. The customary 'clever' Knizia scoring mechanism here is a nice one, with players scoring their lowest colour total, but getting a free turn every time they max out a colour, which leads to some interesting strategies and play decisions.

The 'scrabble with colours' feel means this is an easy shoe-in as a gateway game, but it can feel a little dry sometimes. 

Another Knizia 'so elegantly simple I wish I'd thought of it' gem, then. :)

A fun abstract that plays well with 2-4, IMO. The two player game is more strategic, while the 4 player game is more tactical. An added bonus is that the 2 player game can be played in about 20 minutes, so multiple plays in a single sitting have been common with us.

Get as many points as you can, yet don't make it too easy for others to get even more.  Simultaneous scoring and denial is hard to pull off, yet oh so satisfying when it works.  The endgame is all about denying others what they need, so lagging behind in any one color is often fatal.  Great fun and lots of strategic options in this game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2010)

It’s been years since I last played Ingenious. I don’t really like the game and I never did. I played the game for the first time on 2010, a year I liked most games I played, so if I rated it a 6.0 I didn’t like it very much. 

Its decisions aren’t as hard as some friends seem to think and I feel it has a lot if uncontrollable luck, furthermore with the full complement of players. I prefer to play it with two so the travel edition is currently in my game collection (because my SO enjoys the game). The rules are very easy to explain, so Ingenious is perfect for casual play or to introduce non gamers to our beloved hobby.

Bottom line, Ingenious is way too light for my current tastes, it also has too much luck. I generally enjoy more difficult abstracts. I don’t feel any urge to play the game again.

Really growing on me. It's almost a bit of Tigris and Euphrates light.

Really solid game, pretty damn good and will be around for me a long time.

Even the solo play is good.

This game has surpassed blockus for me. I'm really enjoying Ingenious. It's a great game for scrabble players and the family. Very easy to pick up, some real tactics, some strategy availible, symools and colors on the bits to help color blind folk still be able to play unhindered, very nice game.

A true hit for me and I still, really, see Tigris and Euphrates in this; granted not as themed nor as deep, but the lack of theme makes this game really good for everyone actually.

Is it exciting and laugh out loud glorious mayhem? Nope, but I tell you this game really works and will be around on my table for decades if I can make it last. Very easy to pick up play, very easy to understand scoring, very scalable, and no geek theme to chase nongamers away. Tell 'em it's 'kind of' like scrabble and pull them in.

A game of timing and balance. Tense endgame. Scales well, at least with 2 and 3. Easy to play with kids by moving up their scoring counters. Wish the pieces were thick and wooden like Qwirkle instead of hollow, light plastic; the rack falls over a lot too; so way overpriced for quality of production.  
Update: Moved up to 9 as it mysteriously still entertains upon many replays. One of the few games my wife actually requests. Update: underrated. A master of elegant design.

Very accessible to non-gamers, plays well with 2/3/4 with the playing area increasing with the number of players.  Nice components, needs a good bit of thought, and the lowest score mechanism works very well to force you to balance your play across the colours and anticipate your opponents moves.  Kids can play this from quite an early age - 6 or 7 I would say, and they will play to completion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The epitome of an accessible but absorbing abstract game, good for gamers and casual players alike. On your turn, you lay a tile with two colored spaces on it, and score points in those colors based on the size and shape of the groupings formed by your placement. You cannot neglect any of the six colors, because at the end of the game, your weakest color is the only one that matters (this is the much touted "highest lowest" Knizia scoring system). Simple, approachable, and, by all accounts, deep as well. I enjoyed it and look forward to the occasional play in the future.

RATING: 7.5
This is one of those games with simple rules, but lots of strategy. Colored double hex tiles are played to maximize scoring. Scoring occurs in six different colors, but your lowest of the six is your score at the game end. When you place a tile, for each newly formed linear sequence, the number of hexes are counted and then the matching 1 or 2 newly placed hexes are subtracted. This takes a few turns to get used to and with all the options this requires a lot of calculations by game end. Still, this was a fun game.

Fun game, I'm not sure why I don't like it more than I do. I like abstracts, but I feel that the whole point of the game is to have Knizia's neat-o highest-of-the-least-progressed scoring mechanic.  There just isn't enough control for an abstract and not enough fun theme for a game weak in strategy...

If you're interested in an abstract, I'd opt for something from the GIPF project (DVONN or YINSH), of course these only play 2... that is perhaps where Ingenious shines; as 4 player alternative to the colourful but bland Blockus.

I like the graphics and the play -- but there is something about this that just seems too random.  No strategy -- no real player interaction.. Just wait your turn and put down a piece.

This is a fun abstract that has a Tigris & Euphrates scoring mechanism. You score points in 6 colors and then your final score is your lowest score of the 6 colors. On any given play you can choose from 6 tiles to place, so there are a lot of options each turn. I haven't figured out yet if there is a viable strategy that focuses on blocking opponents rather than scoring yourself. I also have a feeling that the "luck factor" can take over if someone can draw a higher than normal number of the same-color tiles.

RATING: 6
Awfully "clever" game, more visual than most in my collection. The spouse has usually kicked me in it, which accounts for her desire for replays, I think. Being scored on the least-advanced color symbol is a neat mechanic. Works really well with two, three, and four players; even works decently as a solo puzzle game. Nice implementation on BSW, which can be played solo or with up to 4.

A fine abstract game. The competition is driven by the fact that only the lowest colour score counts. Moreover, it has an official solo play version.

As a Knizia fan I was disappointed by Ingenious. It is OK as a filler but most of the strategy is limited to the end-game and even then it is pretty obvious (shut down down a colour when your rivals are weak in it). The game thus appears to be primarily about luck after a rather meaningless opening.

RATING: 9
This is just such a great puzzle. I love the rising and falling values of each colors, how green is just so easy to get one turn and then disappears after it gets locked up. I also love the extra turns when you hit 18. If you're real high in a color, there's not point in pushing it, except if you can hit that 18. 17's no good though, scoring never reaches there, and so you have to wait until the exact best moment. Real exciting stuff to pull off too.

RATING: 6
Interesting game in several ways. 

I'm definitely not a fan of the light plastic pieces and the rather unattractive symbols, and I recognise that this purely cosmetic aspect of the game gives me an attitude to the game. Yes, I'm that shallow. But just as a game of Go with cheap plastic bits and a thin card board somehow doesn't have the gravitas of a version of the game with heavy ceramic pieces and a wooden board, so Ingenious signals, for me, light and rather superficial.

Which is isn't. Yes, it's easy to explain the rules, and easy to start playing, and easy to understand the scoring, but after a few turns the game becomes tactically more and more demanding. 

There's enough chance in the tile draw to make it possible for any player to win any given game, though a skilled player will win in the long run. But will there ever be a long run? Each game is a bit too dominated by chance for my taste, and makes it one of those games I'm never all that keen to get to the table - except to introduce someone to a game that isn't Scrabble.

[LUP 17-Jun-2006] Was introduced to this via BSW.  It wasn't until my fourth game that somebody actually explained the scoring to me, I did a little better after that!  We picked up a physical copy of Ingenious at the Australian Games Expo for AUS$55

It has some reminiscent Reinerisms, particularly you score your [b]lowest[/b] score of all the colours.  A quick game, caters well for different number of players.

Based on 30+ plays.  Though quite simple, Ingenious allows for a fair amount of strategy.  The short duration and sparse rules yield a game that even my parents enjoy.

I usually don't like abstract games, but I like Ingenious with its Tigris and Euphrates style scoring.  You get extra turns by maxing out a color, but alas, those colors don't count toward your score.  You have to always watch you worst color and pounce on it if an opportunity presents.

I've played this several times.  This game and Blokus opened my eyes to better appreciating abstract games.  I'm still not a devout abstract fan.  But I am far more open to them than I was.

I am just such a fan of T&E style scoring in games.  By itself provides such an elegant twist.  Since your score is based upon which color you scored lowest in the better player will try to place in such as way as to limit opponents.  Additionally some well timed "Ingenious" plays near the end of the game can help launch you to victory with bonus moves.  In many cases you can also manipulate for a full discard.  Occasionally randomness will still bite you. Still uncertain therefore if I like it better than something like Quirkle even if I do highly prefer the scoring here. Here you can win with 11 points rather than 211 elsewhere.  No need for pencils or calculators either!

UPDATE: Yeah,I'll give it an 8. It has some really lovely tension in the endgame.

RATING: 7
The best way to introduce people to the world of Knizia games. This has many elements that you'll find in more complex form in other Knizia games, but this game is light on the rules and is a pure abstract with outstanding components. For being light on rules, it has plenty of depth to explore and won't easily wear out its welcome. 

Update 12/1 - I am beginning to think this is best as a two-player game, or four-player partnership. In playing with three players, I have found that typically one color becomes a common denominator for everyone - it doesn't become apparent till later in the game, but when it does become apparent, the winner seems almost a foregone conclusion well before the game is actually over. Will have to try again with three a few more times to see how this bears out.

Ingenious (American version). A simple hex tile-laying game that is both interesting and compelling.  Random draw of tiles saves the game from being both too predictable and "too abstract."   (April 2005)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another family-friendly game from Reiner Knizia. The goal is to score points in each of six colors, by lining up hexagonal tiles radiating outward from the tile that you play. The trick is to do this without setting up your opponents for an even bigger score. Easy to learn, and fairly well done (though a board that keeps pieces from sliding around would be even better). My problem with this game (and this could be said of nearly every Knizia game) is that it feels like a math exercise more than a game.

Luck of the draw and whoever can see the board the most or count points in their head the best will most likely end up on top of this one.  The board is a real pain with all the pieces that don't quite stay together like they should.

RATING: 8
A tile laying game where you score in six different colors by aligning your pieces with existing rows of matching color. As more points are scored in a given color it can open up windows of opportunity to score even more in that color but you have to balance those opportunities against your need for scoring in other colors because, in the end, your final score is only as good as your worst color. 

This is a clever game that is easy to learn and does have some luck of the draw but also really rewards strategic play. I really enjoy the tension of balancing trying not to neglect any color while trying to benefit from as many high scoring opportunities as possible.

Ingenious is a clever abstract game that can work charm as an introductory game for certain people. The simplicity of their rules along with its polished look can grab the attention of those who consider that all non-classic and socially accepted board and card games are a pastime for the kids.

Initially, the rules might seem clunky and unnecessarily complicated but they are very simple to explain if you see them in action. This means that the best way to explain a game is either see people playing it or laying out several play examples. This way, you can teach the rules in a few minutes, which is a huge plus. The basic core is as follows: each player has a hand of two-coloured tiles. In your turn you play a tile adjacent to a previously placed one and score points in one or both of its colours depending on the surrounding tiles. By the end of the game, each player's score is his lowest scored colour (that is, is someone has 16, 17, 18, 20 and 20 has a score of 16) and the winner is the one with the highest score.

Personally, I don't like it that much. The interaction is very indirect and, even if play is simple, is not that easy to see how your movements are going to affect other players. This leads to a very friendly and family oriented environment of which I'm not particularly fond of. Yes, you can block other player's scores but its very hard to win if you focus on an aggressive strategy. And this friendliness is what doesn't convince me, as I would have much preferred a more conflict-oriented approach.

If you are looking for an introductory abstract that works well with two to four players this is one of your best options, if not the best. But if you like conflict-oriented games with direct interaction you should stay away from this one, as it's the total opposite.

I know abstract games aren't as popular as those with themes but honestly, this is worth giving a try. Unlike Blockus this one has the ability to block, lead, mislead, and completely mess with your opponents while at the same time defending your own position. The random tile draw adds some unassurance of future moves but since you have six tiles the randomness isn't THAT random and planning can still happen (similar to planning in Scrabble). Great game that I'm scared may get overlooked simply because it uses colors and shapes rather than space men or knights. Oh, and for the color blind, the game is not dependent on colors to play--I was proud of the designers to make both shape and color dependent upon each other so that color was a non-issue.

In Ingenious, a.k.a. Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each color group that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to her worst-scoring color, not her best, so she needs to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.

[2008.Feb.19] Everyone's favorite mathematician, Reiner Knizia, designs another 'easy-to-play, hard-to-win' (abstract) tile-laying game. This excellent gateway game is a great way to introduce non-gamers into the world of non-Monopoly, non-Risk board games. My only (minor) gripe is that I wish the game included a board that constrained the placed plastic tiles from freely sliding around. That said, this classic should be in everyone's collection. Let your inner genius out!

First, I want to say that I hate almost all knizia games. Apparently, it's common to have auction in Knizia games, ingenious does hot have any. Which is a good thing, else I would have rated it like 3 or below.

It's a simple abstract game where place tiles to make lines of color to score more points. Each color has it's own scoring track. If I remember correctly, you score the lowest track at the end of the game, So you want to make sure to boost up all your track. If you fill up a track, you get an additional move. So there is an opposition between the need to concentrate and diversify the colors you score.

The game is not so bad, but it's really not the kind of game you would play 3 times in a row. Twice per year would be fair enough.

RATING: 8
Fun game.  Light and quick and different.  Counting your lowest score works well to make sure you don't just try to max out on one color.

RATING: 7
A excellent abstract "tile-laying connections" game that plays great as a 4-plyr partnership or as individuals.  Has the typical Knizia E&T scoring system (score of each team/player is their weakest score with the tiebreaker being the next weakest, and the next, etc.).  If you like Blokus or Ta Yü, chances are you might like this medium weight game also.

I have been a longtime fan of abstract games (in fact they led me to the Euro games that I now play a bit more often).  This is an above average 2 player abstract that is absolutely the BEST multiplayer abstract game I have ever played.  As an avid (although poor) Bridge player, I especially enjoy the partnership version.  My children (7 and 8 years old) also enjoy this game quite a bit and often make strong plays to optimize their points (although they haven't yet figured out the joys of blocking their opponents).

Surpasses Blokus for the crown of popular light-middleweight multi-player abstract game (By popular, I clumsily mean a game which has broken out of local game stores and can be found in a variety of retailers).

All the surrounding comments give a good flavour of the game but what strikes me is the rules; or to be exact what is not said in the rules.  They are beautifully succinct with excellent examples but this is a multi-player abstract where the true beauty of the game is discovered between the lines of the rules.  This is not a treasure that you are led to and shown but you have to discover yourself.

I understand that this is not a rare occurance, nearly all games ... the good ones at least ... have this self-discovery element, those little eureka moments, but I feel the excellent rules are a great example and allow this game to breathe and develop a life of its own (A clue to its high replay value and ability to be played by all levels of gamer).  A credit to all involved in developing this wonderful game.

I play this game on my iPhone everyday, sometimes with my friends, mostly with the Hard AI. The gameplay is totally original and deep as hell. Also, medium random chance makes the game unpredictable, even if you are pro, you may not always win. Dr. Knizia is an ingenious.

Played only on BSW.  I've played about 10 games of this online so far (all possible configurations), and I'm REALLY enjoying this.  There are some possible issues (randomness of the tile draw, weak player syndrome), so this rating is not etched in stone, but for now I definitely want to play this all the time!
UPDATE: Okay, I hit the wall with this one.  Now, I've played it almost 150 times (thanks BSW), but the ratings, as written, are based on current desire to play, so I've dropped it to 7 to reflect my burnout.

Another favorite here. The Knizian scoring of best lowest means you have to choose between the easier higher scoring boost to something you already have or the precious one or two points in one you have only a little. Add to that opportunities for blocking play and the ease of learning (though difficult to master) you have a classic that had Spiel de Jahres all over it if not for that Ticket to Ride game.

Reiner's abstract version of his game where your score it the score of the lowest of six tracks.  Place a double hex tile and score the two colors adjacent to it in a straight line from the hex placed.  There is a lot of strategy because you can place and cutoff other players.  It is a simple yet highly strategic.  I find the game very fun and one of his best.

Tigris and Euphrates without even the semblance of a theme (or conflicts, or treasure or monuments, ok... it's just got the same end of game scoring as T&E).  Fun abstract game you can enjoy even if you don't normally like abstracts.  Quickly becoming a favorite introductory game.

On the mechanical design, there's nothing to complain about.

But the physical design of this version is not okay. 
The tiles are passable, but since the groove on the back is not used to hold the tiles on the board, they should have been equally thick all over. The heavier the better.
The board is dull and there should have been embossed centers to hold the tiles like in the travel edition (this would require a deeper groove on the back of the tiles), or holes and corresponding pokes on the tiles.
The scoreboards are the worst. They look way dull and it is far too easy to accidentally push a marker with your sleeve. It should have been pegboards, sliders or something else that works.

I know that all of the above raises the production price, but abstract games simply must have better physical design than normal games.

Scoring each turn is kind of disruptive to my mind, but it doesn't bother me too much. Board and score tracks and box extremely nice high quality linen finish. Hexes are more lightweight than I expected but fine. One-player variant was surprisingly enjoyable. 

12/18- didn't go over as well as Blokus at family xmas! Played with sis, and a ten year old. Both of them had a little trouble grasping the scoring for a few terms. But the room was kinda loud :). We decided that shutting others out of colors they might need might be a strategy. As it was, this being our first game, it felt very much like 3 solo games. There was very little interaction, no take that.

12/25 going from 8 to 9. We're familiar with the concept now. Strats/tactics (I still need to learn the difference) began unfolding in our brains as I mentinoed in another comment, like petals unfurling on a flower. Nice screwage element. No one is ever out of a game until perhaps the last turn or two, if they've been unlucky/screwed with.

Straight forward, quick clean fun.  Strategy and tactics but without so much optimization that you can't have a good chat with the people you're playing with.

Added to my collection in January 2010. First played in February 2011.

I have played a few times face to face but have logged a number of games using an online version of the game. I find it very enjoyable and would initially rate this as a solid 7.

Initial rating after face to face plays: Solid 7.

Last game played in 2011.

I think the whole game here is its "genius" scoring system. The winner is declared after comparing the worst colour in points of each player when the whole board is covered with tiles. Thus, we are forced to try to evenly deploy all the kinds of the coloured tiles.

For some reason, presumably because of the whole setting, it reminds me of scrabble, but "ingenious" is much, much better.

7.5 - May 2014 - 3 Plays:  A really enjoyable game with two players.  I haven't tried with more players yet.  I'm not sure that I've really cracked this game open yet, it seems like it has quite a bit of strategy in a small package.

8.0 - Aug 2015 - 10 Plays:  I don't know why this doesn't see the table very often, it's an excellent game.  I should make an effort to teach it more, and try with other player counts.

I've only played Ingenious once, and while it was fun I don't think my brain is wired to win at this one. It was like everyone at the table -- including the other first-timer -- was playing an entirely different game, and that game was one I just didn't get.

Decent (bordering on stupid) tile-laying game, but one that hasn't grabbed me as much as others.

A decent abstract game, although it didn’t have much staying power for me as a 2-player game.  I was drawn to its Tigris & Euphrates like scoring mechanisms (which is cool), but of course the gameplay is completely different.  Maybe with more experience my opinion would change, but I just felt like the best moves were quite obvious on any given turn.  The principal consideration was how to set yourself up for getting a bonus turn without handing too many points to your opponent.  The end-game kind of falls apart as the winner was determined by whoever didn’t get blocked out of scoring in the last few turns.

RATING: 9
In [i]Ingenious[/i], you need to constantly evaluate your needs relative to those of your opponent.  Sometimes your best move is to maximize points without regard for blocking, whereas at other times going for the block, even if you don't score any points, is best.

The player who wins is typically the first to identify his opponent's primary weakness, which is often not as simple as seeing which color is lagging behind in points.  It is a combination of your score in a color, your opponent's score in that color, and the number of openings that color has on the board and how easy they are to close off.

This is Knizia's best two-player game. As a 3-4 player game it loses a bit of luster. With two players, I rate it a perfect 10.

03/25/08 Played 75% of a four player game, once. A very nice, easy to get into, abstract. I look forward to playing it again. 11/04/08 Finally got to play (two) whole games; both two-player. My initial impression stands. 07/28/09 Played a three-player game. Ingenious scales well. 01/05/10 Played another three-player game. 06/08/10 Another three-player game. 
12/07/11 Received my own FFG red box 2010 edition copy. I like the pegboards in this version, but the tile racks of the 2008 version were better.  
12/13/11 Played a three-player game. 05/22/12 Played a four-player game. 07/24/12 Ditto. 

01/19/13 Played a three-player game. I was absolutely shocked when I got the board out today for the fourth game with my copy, the board fell apart!!! One section (1/4 of the board) separated where it folded. It left the game still playable. But in over 30 years of playing games with folding boards I've never seen one come apart. Yet what really irked me was, as I said, this was only the fourth time the board had been unfolded! And I've never been one to be rough with game boards. I can only assume there was some manufacturing defect. I wonder if this has happened to others with Ingenious.
06/04/13 Played a four-player game.  10/15/13 Played a four-player game.  07/05/14 Played a four-player game. 12/13/14 My first two-player game; twice. It worked fine this way.  05/30/15 Played a brace of three-players games.  08/22/15 Played a three-player game. 11/21/15 Another three-player game. 01/12/16 A four-player game. 02/27/16 A three-player game.  05/10/16 Three-player game. 08/30/16 A four-player game. 11/29/16 A four-player game. 04/25/17 Played a three-player game. 08/08/17 Played a two-player game. 01/09/18 Played a three-player game.

I can really appreciate the elegance of this neat abstract, but somehow it's hard to feel passion for it. However if you're lukewarm about abstracts it still worths to get it, because it's relatively cheap, and the sturdy cardholders are usable well in any card or tile-laying game.

While the "low number" scoring is brilliant for an abstract area control game, Ingenious is a bit at the mercy of players' methods.  If [i]all[/i] players are cutthroat, the games seems to work as intended and is quite good.  However if a single players starts to just got for the easy points without closing off scoring ares, the game can quickly descend into a point rush where each color has a single blob and players not lucky enough to draw that color during the rush can be left with no recourse once the rush moves on to another color.

I have played this one a few times solitaire and a few times as a four player match. Something about the game that makes me feel like it is much deeper than I'm catching onto. Think multiple plays could potentially raise the score.

Tempting abstract, even for newbies. Very easy to explain and loads of fun to play for a couple of games in a row. Plays fast too. It's the kinda game I'd gladly see overtake the usual crap at the usual gamestores, since it might go well enough with a usual crowd. So it has everything to become a classic in a way. You have to be in the mood to play an abstract though.
Good abstract game for beginners too.

Update: After quite some plays and still too many beauties lying unplayed on my shelves the shine is wearing thinner on this one. Downgraded a point for that.

NL: leuk strategisch/tactisch legspel zonder thema.
Makkelijk uit te leggen, leuk om te zien, voor de meer ervaren spelers kun je elkaar ook taktisch dwarszitten. Beetje te vaak gespeeld inmiddels, maar blijft zijn charmes hebben, en altijd prima voor een snel potje tussendoor.

A light, fun abstract game.  The more I play the more strategy I see, but I don't know if I like it any better.  It's great as a simple, something-different type of game, or something to play with non-gamers.  Not my first choice if I have gamer people over though.

RATING: 8
Game in a Nutshell: Lay tiles making lines of similar colors. Score points depending on how many consecutive similar colors there are in that line. Keep all six of your different colors scores high because the final score is what your lowest scoring color is.

Played as: 1,2,3,4 (solo and team)  player 

Pros: A quick, easy to learn game with enough luck that everyone, no matter what their skill-level, feels like they have a shot. Also very versatile in that it gets on the table in many different situations. Scales well from 2-4 players. My favorite part is when you get into the game, how much you begin to play off your opponent's scores bringing a higher level of interaction then appears at first.

Cons: Tile draws can hurt you and I guess it's annoying to play with table bumpers / heavy tile nudgers. Solitaire play is too fiddly and random to be worth its time.

Other: At first I thought of this as mini or light Tigris and Euphrates, but as a played each one more, I've found them to be excellent for their own unique qualities-- no longer feeling so similar.

Best Use: Similar to Carcassonne, fills in almost anywhere.

RATING: 7
Probably my favorite abstract at the moment.  Scales well and has good components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Early game is a mite boring and something about the components turn me off.  The intricacies of blocking in the late game are it's saving grace.

Caveat: I don't understand the game well. The best players play at an unbelievably high level, and Knizia, who strains to remain impartial about his games, let slip in an interview that it might be his favorite of his games. These two facts together suggest I haven't played enough or with the right people, and if I did I might see the game in a different, more favorable light.

[UPDATE] After playing it through the iphone app, my opinion of it has changed for the much better.  Just as is the case for many people who've rated it, my initial tepid impression has gotten hotter with better understanding.  As in Scrabble, rack management matters a lot but it takes a while to figure out how to do it. Now that I know some things about rack management, the whole game is much better from beginning to end, and accordingly I've upped my rating to an 8. Great game. 

[UPDATE] After even more time has passed (and about 1000 plays total), this game is just straight beautiful, at least for two players, which is how I play it. I now see why Knizia is so proud of it. This game sort of sums up his whole career, in a way: the complexity hidden inside unassuming simplicity and the signature scoring method, the profound balance, the exquisite implementation of chance. A lot of BGGers seem to complain about Knizia's turn toward simplicity in recent years. There seems to be a widespread assumption among BGGers that simple rules mean shallow or uninvolved play, which I'd guess comes from the BGGer habit of playing many games in a shallow way (thereby failing to see past the surface of most games). I've gone the other way: I think his turn towards simplicity has made him a better designer. Ingenious is a prime example.   

This is a game I'd love to play in a tournament setting. There aren't many games with chance events for which that's true. And yet at the same time I can play it casually with a non-gamer.  

One gripe: the components (of the FFG edition). The pieces feel ugly, and they don't look great on the also-not-wonderful board. I think it could have been done much better, and I think this weakness is one of the things holding the game back.

Nice light and engaging game. Very family-friendly. Felt a bit like "multiplayer solitaire" in that the opponent's strategic position is very difficult to evaluate, coupled with the difficulty of blocking until late in the game. This makes the game a tad too tactical for me, but my family would love this and therefore it is deemed "a good game" in my books.

[u]01/24/2013[/u]: This is my favorite abstract game.  As with any good abstract, the rules are simple and yet there is a lot to this game due to the scoring.  You score points based on the color tiles you play throughout the game keeping each color separate.  At the end of the game, your score is the color with the least amount of points.  So, even though you scored 18, 18, 15, 12, 10, and 7.  Your final score is only 7.  That little caveat makes this game very interesting to play, as you must look for scoring big points in all colors while blocking your opponent from getting what they need.

A bonus with this game is the scalability.  You can play 2 to 4 players on the same board using more or less of the area depending on the number.  The components in my edition (Fantasy Flight red box) are okay but not great.  The board is slightly warped, and the tiles could be a little thicker with painted designs instead of stickers.  But overall this is a great game that should work with almost any audience.

Underwhelming. Quite a bit of randomness for an abstract; very little planning ahead one can do in the face of hidden information. That's not really the kind of challenge  I'm interested in. Barely even seems like an abstract to me, except that it's abstract. Still, it's very quick and easy to explain, so it should work with a wide audience. 

Without the rule that the winner is determined by the best worst score, it would be a totally different game, so I think criticism in that direction is misplaced. A more proper line of criticism would be along the lines of: there's just not much there.

This is an abstract game wherein players get points by placing colored tiles so that they create the longest runs of those colors.  There are six different colors in all, and points are tracked for each color separately (so a run of four yellow pieces generates 4 yellow points, but no points for any other color). Victory is determined by the points each player has in their lowest-point-total color, so players must be sure to place pieces of every color.  

Tiles are drawn randomly, so the board has a different layout each game.  This game is a great short game (we finished two-player games in less than 30 minutes).

Nice game where you need to match colored tiles to score points.  Planning is a little hard in it, but there are some approaches one can take to modulate strategy.  Either way, it's easy to learn, pretty looking game that makes you feel smart playing it (because of the relative easy and cleverness of some plays you can make).  Most annoying thing about it is the peg boards used to keep score.  More than one of the pegs have flown across the room mid-game due to the size/strength ratio needed to operate that contraption.

Igazi Knizia játék. Nem vagyok minden áron absztrakt rajongó, de ez kétségkívül betalált:
- kétoldalú dominók, csak itt nem számok, hanem színek vannak rajtuk

- játék végén az veszít, akinek a legkevesebb pontja van valamelyik színből
- pontozása, játékmenete egyedi
- egy parti 10-15 perc alatt lejátszható (applikációval legalábbis)

The other abstract game we like: in comparison to Blokus, you need some drawing luck with the tiles but if you haven't got any tile from your worst color, you may draw all your tiles all over again which softens the drawing luck a lot. Nice game, also for non-gamers. Original Knizia-like scoring mechanism of 'the worst color counts for your final score'.

Fantastic two-player game when you don't have much time, three and four player versions take a bit longer.  Very easy to teach, yet more tricky than it looks.  Appears to have a high luck factor, but the rule that lets you exchange all your tiles if you don't have any with your lowest color mitigates this in my mind.  The solitaire variant is fun, too, although luck plays a larger role with it.

Még csak két fővel játszottam. Mindig én nyertem, nagyon egyszerű taktikai játéknak tartom, ahol legalább annyira kell figyelni az ellenfeled, mint saját magad.
Eleinte a minél több pont gyűjtése a cél, de a játék felétől, kétharmadától ritmust kell váltani, és a saját és ellenfelünk leggyengébb színére kell koncentrálni, hiszen a végén az lesz a döntő. Szoros a vége, elég gyakori a döntetlen, és kell a többi színt is vizsgálni.
Nagyon taktikus, blokkolós absztrakt, a szokásos csavaros Knizia pontozással, ami miatt lesz a játék az ami. Nehezen tudom pozicionálni, mindenesetre a Qwirklenél nekem jobban tetszik.

I'm like many of those that don't like abstract games but have played this one and have been impressed. There is some luck and guessing, but there is also a fair amount of room to develop and apply solid tactics. A good candidate as a "gateway" game for non-gamers, or for couples/older children/families who are looking for something much better than dominoes.

The simplicity of the tile placement abstract game with the depth of tactics and strategy over the scoring (lowest colour only scores) really works well.

Elegant & abstract, but I've basically played it on my iPad. A game against the AI doesn't take too long; a matter of minutes, actually. 

The real one I remember enjoying, but wouldn't probably invest in one, because I'm guessing it slows the game down way too much when you consider the weight of it. Plus if I wanted to play 2-player abstracts (which I almost never do, not having the company to play them with), I'd play something more interesting, like YINSH, Go, Chess, Patchwork etc.

Enjoyed by family members more than I.  That's not to say i don't like it - but the fact that *they* do means it's tabled more often then not... which isn't a bad thing because I do like the game - i just don't *love* it. It's a quick and easy game to teach and play. Besides, i'm on a quest to own all SPJ winners.  Still, i'll give this one two thumbs up (or a 7.5)

Ingenious is a very quick playing and very easy to learn game. The pace of the game moves along very nicely which really helps with replay value and that "let's have another game" reaction. I can certainly see a bit of T&E influence in this from Knizia. I also really like how many of his game designs have boards which "shrink/grow" depending on how many players there are in the game so as to keep up the constriction in the choices you make on the board.

RATING: 7.5
Really enjoy this abstract that plays quickly and yet actually feels like fun, almost like Qwirkle but with all the slow bits taken out.  The six scoring areas make it feel a little like a race, but the win condition (only your weakest colour, a la Tigris) means that you really have to strive for balance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Putting coloured dominoes together satisfies some part of the human brain that is hypnotised by playing any match 3 game on a web browser, but reusing the Tigris & Euphrates scoring system isn't enough to make Ingenious compelling. You have this illusion of interesting decisions and rewards, which probably helped it gaining a place in households and a shocking amount of awards, but the level of processing one's brain should have for proper strategy to circumvent sheer luck seems super-human to me.

A very cool abstract game.  I like the use of the Tigris & Euphrates scoring, and the four player team variant is really fun.

Hmm... either this game is so deep that my family and I can't even begin to glimpse the strategies buried deep within it... or...

it's a rather enormous disappointment.

Knizia abstract game. Two joined hexagonal pieces are the playing pieces. Each piece has two symbols on it, out of 6 possible symbols. Play on the map to score points by linking up with other like symbols. Like Euphrates and Tigres, score is the minimum of all your symbol points. This is a delightful abstract game, can be played with all kinds of people, and it is also fun when played in teams.

Works beautifully as a 2-player. Played it once as a 4-player and it was weirdly open, with pretty much everyone maxing out most of their colours. I'm not sure if we did something wrong or whether it relies on players trying to block each other a bit more than we actually did.

Herr Knizia is einfach genial!

This game can be neo-classic in 50 years from now. Deceptively simple idea that works extremely well. It feels like area-controling game like Euphrat & Tigris. Also it is a risk-management game as you want to make sure you score bofore certain colors are dead for good. Good with 2-4 players and 1-player solitaire is also fun.

I would like to try partnership game!!

RATING: 6
A really well designed game.  It can be taught in almost no time and is easy to play from the first game, but still requires brainpower to plan your strategy.  The mechanic of having your overall score being the score of your weakest colour makes the game special -- it will be easy to grab points in several colours, but much harder to make sure that you don't end up leaving one underdeveloped.  There are also opportunities for screwage by blocking off the colours your opponents need to score in, and this can work really well if you're careful to plan when you'll get your bonus plays.

Interesting abstract. I bought it because a friend of mine had to implement a version of this game in a programming course, and she claimed the scoring system was dumb. I disagreed, then bought this to prove it to her.

Not ingenious, and much lighter than I expected.  I liked the scoring mechanism, but longed for a little more complexity.  For a tactical, "play-'em"/"count-'em" game, I think I'd rather play China.  Anyway, still a fun light game that I'd play if asked.

A good abstract game. The trick is finding plays that will get you points, but not set up the next played to get even more. Still not the greatest at this, but it seems like a good strategy is to block what is needed by your opponent. It's always important to be aware of how you compare to your opponent in each color. If you can block off a color that your opponent is weak in, you can concentrate on collecting everything else, and hope to keep them weak in that color.

(I own Finnish edition: "Genial")
Abstract game with scoring knizia seems to like (your score is lowest one of many). Offers just right balance between luck and skill. As a bonus works even as solitaire. I like it most with 3 players but it works 2-4 players well. Haven't tried to play with 4 as teams, that probably is also very good.

Updated (28.2.2006) rating after few games from 7 to 8.

Cool, but it doesn't get to the table enough; I'm not sure I like the scoring mechanic, but I admit it gives the game a sense of tension that I do end up liking. And it's an 'abstract' I can get people to play.

RATING: 9
For Ingenious Rainer Knizia uses only a couple of features from his masterpiece Euphrat & Tigris (scoring, placing tiles next to matching colours), leading to a less complex but more refined and ultimately more rewarding game. Drawing a tile every turn there is obviously some luck, but the more plays, the more ways are found to channel it: being this a game where wins are earned by constant scoring and with lots of free board until the end the winner is always the best player.

As most abstracts, this game works at best with two players, when there's more time and space to unfold. Besides, there's a good solitaire in it as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Tipico gioco di Knizia, ovvero astratto con regolamento corto e semplice ma ricco di profondità. Gioco piacevole, anche se non manca la componente fortuna, che offre partite avvincenti e può essere molto apprezzato anche, e soprattutto, in 4 giocatori.

A mean, mean abstract with two players, expanding to a more family-friendly pastime with more. Knizia's classic, and very clever, scoring trademark is used perfectly here. Nice big chunky components come as something of a refreshing change after the 'Travel' version.

Um bom jogo abstrato. Regras de fácil entendimento é muito legal de se jogar. Pode ter um pouco de dúvida na hora da contagem dos pontos, é bom prestar atenção. Ensinei pra pessoas que nunca haviam jogado nada de boardgame moderno e pegaram rapidinho as regras e macetes. Recomendo ter na coleção.

What an Ingenious game! Has the ability to screw with your opponents and really encourages thinking outside the box with Knizia scoring. Have had nail-biting finishes aplenty. Only played with 2p thus far.

Ok...this is the best abstract strategy game yet...in my wife's opinion! It is a great 2-player game, but it is so much fun as a 4-player game too. Unexpected! Place your tiles next to matching tiles of the same symbol and collect your points. But you must connect all the colored symbols for points or else you will find your losing color will make you the loser!

Played first on BSW.  It was fun, but I didn't love it.  But tried a few more games and found that it plays well with all #'s and partnership vs. partnership is fun too!  Had a sneaking suspicion my wife would love it.

Finally got bought this through the marketplace and I was right--my wife loves it!  It's a good mix of luck and strategy, it plays fast, and it's just so tactile.  It's fun putting those pieces down.  Rating went up!

Then eventually went down as it gets kind of samey.

Not sure why this game gets such rave reviews. To me, it feels like go with very limited expansion options, combined with a race game where you have to drag a lot of baggage with you. It's not a bad game at all; I'd play it most anytime. But I wouldn't go out of my way to play. I think there are many better games around.

An approachable abstract from Dr. Knizia. It captures the essence of T&E without all the nitty gritty rules - the best bit i.e. the scoring system.

I actually like Knizia's pure abstract games, and always feel let down or confused, even cheated when I play his "Euro" games with completely fake themes. Often the themes are counter productive as I expect game entities to work one way and they do something completely at odds with what they are allegedly represnting. 

It's not one of my top games but I have no objection to playing it.

The whole plastic abstract thing just doesn't do it for me, and once you've figured out it's all about minimising scores in your opponent's weak colours, there seems to be not much more to it. It reminded me of the kid's game Face-It, where you usually score one bigger than the previous player does unless you're unlucky enough not to have an appropriate tile. Anyway, it's a grown up version, so I'm passing.

RATING: 7
Interesting game with a really good scoring mechanism that is very similar to the manner in which the winner is dtermined in Tigris and Euphrates (i.e. your lowest scoring color IS your score and hence whoever has the highest "low" score wins).  The scoring emphasizes balance, which seems to be a theme in many Knizia games.  There is also a point in the game when you need to switch your focus to defense and block opponents' scoring.  Finding that point can be tough.

RATING: 6
Some interesting ideas, but I am not a huge fan of abstract games. Also the scoring although neat reduces much of the strategy to luck of the draw. The final score is based on your lowest score which mostly comes down to your least drawn tile. So if some one draws way more of their least drawn tile then they cream you and there is no skill in that. 

If the scoring were pure points or your second lowest I think it would work better.

The rules can be explained to anyone in about 3 minutes.  Ingenious is a simple geometric tile laying game.  New ideas still occur to me often - after 21 plays.  But I can't love a completely abstract game.

It gets a lot of plays because my two sons and girlfriend all agree on it. My youngest son seems to have a winning strategy (I am trying to figure out what it is).  It is also a perfect gateway game for guests who are new to euros.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Though purely abstract, I find this game fairly compelling, and a great choice to introduce new gamers to hobby games.  The scoring mechanism forces you to be balanced, but it's often good to take advantage of one particular color while it's available, because if you ignore it, it'll get shut off.  Blocking is possible and sometimes advisable, though it's tough to maximize your tile that way.  The game does have some seating issues, as you definitely want to be after someone who likes leaving things open instead of blocking them.

Oct 2014: Have played this with my sons quite a bit. It's a solid game, attractive, good tactile appeal. Much better than playing dominoes or others of that ilk. I'd heartily recommend this game for your collection if you like abstracts, or need something as a bridge for non-gamers. Not really deep enough for serious play, but it is fun in a mild way.

Works as a gateway, and offers enough strategy to merit repeated plays. Decide when to develop your top and when to develop your bottom, and don't take your bonus moves too early. And it just looks clever; who wouldn't want to play with equilateral decagons?
Seems like some of the early English language printings came with about half a rulebook. The one you can read online makes a lot more sense.

A terrific play-with-spouse game. Easily works as a gateway game. Follows the Knizia model of scoring your "lowest highest". That is, in this game you score colors, and at the game, you look to see who scored the lowest in any color. That person comes in last. Ties are resolved by seeking the next lowest up. The winner is the one who's lowest score in any color was the "highest low". This forces you to constantly rebalance your effort as you play, for even though you are scoring well in a few colors, it's the last color's advance that will be tallied in the end.

I saw this when passing a local charity shop.

Really pretty game to look at -- you place tiles next to tiles of a like color to score points. Like several other Knizia games, your only score that counts is the lowest one, so you have to grow colors evenly.

I originally bough this game when I was looking for a suitable game to play while camping.  The large, plastic components are ideal for wet conditions and places where things are likely to get lost.  I have played this game countless times and have enjoyed it more every time.  The principles are very simple, making it a very easy game to learn.  There area  lot of tictacs that you pick up the more and more that you play.  When it gets close to the end of the game you often find yourself trying to mess up other peoples games rather than attempting to increase your own score!! Perfect for those malicious people among us.

This one grows on me the more I play it. The level of play evolves from "play to maximize your score" to "make sure that you don't get caught with a closed off color" to "manipulate the board to freeze out other players."

RATING: 6
Update: As my playing time is greatly reduced I feel any free playtime should be spent playing the more climatic predecessor Euphrat and Tigris

The victory condition of "weakest value scores" used in E&T has now expanded to 6 colours and made public. And this last change highlights the importance of visual status for better gaming experiences, elevating the game to dramatic swings in who's winning at the moment and can instill a competitive tension as you (and your teammate) try to push your straggling colours, whilst limiting the progress of your opponents weakest colours. So there are tactical offensive & defensive tile placements & when to take advantage of extra turns. One of the few abstracts I enjoy, but it can get nasty and alittle humourless but poses interesting problems. My rating is for 4 player partners as this situation means you have a dependency on your partner playing well or setting you up and as a result situations can get incredibly tense. Good 2 player lunchtime game, rating 7; with 3 two opponents reduces alot of control.

 With obvious ties to Dominoes, it is an abstract that plays quickly. It has a significant random factor in that tile draws can determine the winner (but the same is true of Dominos).

RATING: 8
This game is all about the scoring system -- it seems that the mechanics were almost an afterthought.  Still, I think it works.  There are many tough choices to be made, and it is very important to think both offensively and defensively.  If you can deny any particular color to your opponent(s), you'll probably win the game.

On the down side, the tile draw is a much bigger factor than in T&E, for example.  A few bad tile draws can really hose you, and unlike T&E, there is only one way to score points in this game.  My other minor complaint is with the board, which allows the pieces to slide around.  Some sort of locking mechanism for the pieces would have been a great improvement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game itself does justice to its name.  Very simple to learn, simple to teach, but lots of complexity to be found.  I LOVE the fact that your score is how far you got your worst piece.  Such a simple but elegant concept.

A good abstract game. You realy have to manage your color in order not to let one of them fall to far behind because you may have trouble bringning it back. The rules are simple and interaction between players, even if not at the firs level, is there. You have to play in order to make your colors advance or try to block the other from advancing theres.

A bon jeu abstrait. Vous devez gérer vos couleurs de façon à ce qu'aucune d'elles ne soient laissés derrière car vous aurez de la misère à les ramener. Les règles sont claires et les interactions entre les joueurs, bien qu'elles ne sont pas du premier degré, sont présentes. Vous devez faire avancer vos couleurs ou empêcher les autres joueurs d'avancer les leurs en bloquant.

I love this game. Like a cross between dominoes and connect 4. Enough strategy involved to keep the older ones interested and challenged, easy enough to pick up (and the scoring so - well - "ingenious") to allow the younger ones to play and be competitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is my favorite abstract game. There's room for short-term impluse and long-term strategy. I think this actually works better as a 3-4 player game, where there's real tension between working with others to build longer and longer combos or cut the combo off to leave them high and dry in a certain color. In the two-player version, you just bock each other the whole time, which is strategic but a bit predictable. This is a good game to play with families; it's interactive without feeling too cutthroat.

Ingenious is a very elegant game. Its easy to learn, quick to play and oddly satisfying. There is nothing quite so fun as calling ingenious three times in one round. This has become an instant favourite among our friends and family.

The one thing that brings the score down is the luck factor. It can be frustrating to watch other people rack up points while you have no decent tiles in your hand. You can mitigate this by dumping your whole tile set at the end of a turn, but you could end up with an equally bad set of new tiles.

This game occupies an uncomfortable middle ground for me: The game is a bit too light and strategically shallow considering its length and fiddliness.

Actually, I prefer dominoes over this (in particular, the four player block game in which all 28 dominoes are dealt out). At least a round of dominoes ends in at most seven turns. 

As for other multiplayer abstracts I'd rather play: Octiles, Rumis/Blokus 3D, and Kaliko. These three are similar to Ingenious whereby players add pieces to a common structure of pieces. However, in these three games, the structure being built is far more intriguing.

great abstract tile laying game. this game is sort of the family/introductory version of tigris and euphrates. at first blush there doesn't appear to be much to this game, or  much in the way of control for the players, however, after repeated plays i have to say that there is a nice measure of depth to game play here. if players play defensively, game play will become tense and the decisions a player will be faced with will be satisfyingly difficult for such a simple game.

Still unsure if there's any great skill in placing the tiles, or if it's all about keeping up with the score track. Knizia uses his Euphrat & Tigris "highest lowest score wins" scoring mechanic here.

Still a fun game that I'll play on occasion.

Just picked this one up last week, so I may come back to change my rating.  Only played a few times so far.  Easy rule set, strong pieces, nice racks to hold pieces (great for kids so they don't have to hold on to their six tiles while they wait).  Seems like it's the kind of game that can operate on different levels depending on how intense your group is.  Seems like the kind of game that will be great to pull out for friends who aren't much into gaming.

Update (Feb.'09): Don't play it that much.  A game like Blokus seems to scratch itch better (at least for kids in my h.s. boardgaming club).  I like the scoring mechanism, but I'd rather use it in Tigris and Euphrates.

RATING: 4.5
This is a simple abstract based on dominoes. Players take turns placing double hexagons with two symbols on them and scoring points for matching the symbols to hexagons already played. The first level of play is to place your piece (you have a choice of six) to score the most points. The second, and I was only just begining to see how you might do this at the end of my first game wis to place to prevent your opponent scoring well from your play. Is there more to it than that? I'm not sure. I don't think this game has enough depth to be a really interesting abstract and I don't think it is 'fun' enough to be a family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Probably the best game I know in what I call the "family abstract" genre (an abstract game  usually with some small element of chance, which can handle more than 2 players, has simple rules and colourful pieces and seems to be aimed at the family market). The scoring method - that your final score is the lowest of your 6 individual-colour scores - is really the only interesting thing going on here, but it absolutely makes the game. This is even a pretty good thoughtful game for 2 - there is of course luck in the tile draw, but I'm sure better players will win more often. With more, it tends to be more random. But I haven't yet got to the main problem with this game - that comes when one plays it with non-gamers, which unfortunately will probably be the case most of the time this hits the table. Then most people aren't interested in blocking, but just try to score the highest they can. If everyone else is doing this, you basically have to go along with them, and then it comes down to pure luck...

Neat tile-laying game. Nice and easy to play, but with a clever scoring system (highest low score wins) that adds a whole extra layer of strategy to all your moves. Block players and try to prevent them from scoring in their weakest colors. Fun, and attractively made as well. The more I play it, the more I enjoy it.

Dominoes-esque strategy game which ports over the E&T scoring stystem.  (Actually a bit like a never published domino game I designed as a boy.)

Best as a four player partnership game.

There doesn't seem to be any planned interaction between players -- mostly just accidental interference as you attempt to solve your own puzzle optimally.  So, while the game is pleasing, it doesn't hold my interest.

Hmmmm...Well...after about 30 plays I can say that while it is a fun game I don't understand why it is so highly rated.  I enjoy both the strategy and random drawing of tiles but to have it rated so high as an abstract strategy is unfathomable.  I think that "Ingenious Challenges" is better not just because it has 3 complete games but there is more variety.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another nice tile placement game with points earned in an interesting way at each placement.  Sometimes randomness in the final turns can be too decisive, but the game is short enough that I don't mind.

Good default game for cons and club meetings - many people know it, and it's quick and easy to explain to those who don't.

I like to play ingenious... which actually means a LOT coming from someone who doesn't care too much for abstracts.  This is my favorite abstract (by far).  It's a great light game that can be picked up and played pretty quickly, and it can be pretty addicting.

I probably prefer it with 2 players because you have much more control over your own fate and you must truly focus on blocking more than grabbing points to win.  Plus, inexperienced players will accidentally help the following person by leaving huge scoring runs open.

My parents, who are non gamers, love Ingenious.  They've NEVER been into any kind of board games before... especially my dad.  But after playing Ingenious, he asked me to bring it back by the house next time I come visit.  That's huge.  My wife, however, thinks the game is incredibly boring.  She has no desire to play any kind of abstract.

Very Knizia scoring method of the lowest scoring track is your total score.  This makes it an interesting decision of whether you want to block off a path or keep trying it.

RATING: 6
11/7 rated a 7 with only plays as a two player game.  Works much better than blokus for two players.  I like how it is about trying to make your lowest score higher than their lowest score.  So after a certain point in the game it becomes about eliminating scoring opportunities for them and then maybe scoring for yourself.

Moderately Accessible Light Euro 

One of my favorites! 7% of my collection is Designed by Dr. Knizia, by far the most represented Designer. Here is his famous scoring mechanism (highest lowest score) in its purest form.

I love how the game seems like it should be quite confrontational, but the conflict is dissipated almost to nothing though the abstract nature of the pieces and the wide open beginning--indeed, for many games no pressure at all will be felt until the last 10 or so turns, it feels like all at once someone applies a clamp to the possibilities! For the beginning, it almost feels as if the game is co-operative, everyone building off of each other, which is wonderful. With more play, strategy can play a larger part, and the game gets understandable from further out as one monitors all of the other players color levels for weaknesses.

I make people say 'INGENIOUS' when they reach 18, of course. How could I resist such drama? My kids are terrible at the game, but still they love it, singing Ingenious out with epic delight.

I like Ingenious, but I don't love it - it really does seem too tactical and the tactical choices never strike me as compelling - there's too much reacting to the last turn, scores have been close for me in almost every game - not always a bad sign, but in this case... Still, it isn't bad, and I really do like having games that take two minutes or less to explain to new players.

Haven't quite grasped the strategy just yet after two plays... also, I wonder if the starting player has an advantage... regardless, I really like it and want to play it again!

[b]Edit:[/b] The game proved to be a keeper. After many more games, I think a starting player advantage *may* only rear its ugly head in a two-player game (even then, maybe I am looking too much into it) but regardless this game is one of the archetype abstract strategy games!

Nice abstract. Allows for some strategic planning without hurting your head. Players get a rack of six tiles and a score chart. The score chart tracks your scores for each of the six colors. Scoring is of the "your overall score is the score of your weakest color" variety, so it's important to keep balance your acquisitions. However, there is a bonus turn given to each player whenever you get a color score up to 18, so if it gives you another turn and gets rid of a lousy tile, play it! On your turn you play and draw back up to six. Each tile has two colors on it, in a double-hex arrangement. To play you place one of your tiles on the board, where one of the colors is adjacent to another hex with that color. You score points for each color match, and more if you can add on to existing lines of color. Player scores are open, so you should look for opportunities to shut out color runs that will help your opponents catch up to you. Very simple to play.

I've played a kajillion online games versus AI, but not too many F2F plays.

At first it seems like you can plan for some long (or even short) term strategy, but this game is pretty much random... and I like random games! Sure, there's a bit of planning possible, but there's no reason to play this version of modified dominoes.

The little pegs in the scoreboard are also a pain to push in and out. Esthetically, this game falls apart because of this nuisance.

Very easy to learn, and not too hard to master. It's funny to see newbies say they want to score in a balanced way with their color, then they get tempted and go max out their strongest color at the start of the game. Like a super-blend of Reversi/Othello, Scrabble and Dominoes with the aesthetic look of Blokus. Much prefer with 2er and team-play. 3er is okay if you project for the chaos of the 3rd player, but can often feel trapped in turn order. No point playing with 4.

This is an interesting abstract tile-laying game that is actually a good multi-player abstract.  In fact, it seems to be good for 2-4 players.  This is very good to me.  I like to occasionally play abstract games with people, but it is rare to only be able to play one-on-one except with my wife.  This allows me to scratch my abstract itch on our game nights.  It also more challenging when you are having to play against several other players.  I have yet to find an optimum strategy that I really like.

An opaque abstract? If it's an abstract at all. It's just themeless, but it's not abstract - seems quite a lot things combined together a bit of majorities games (1with 2 players - denying the other player a colour), a bit of an engine (really - that's the incentive to be strong in a certain colour and get an extra move). And AP, oh dear, sometimes you're just staring at the board adding up numbers. 

It's interesting, but doesn't seem as deep as Tzaar for instance. Not that simple or immediate as Indigo. And not that tense as many 2 players abstracts can be. Sorry, but this didn't deserve a SdJ win. It's interesting, it's good, but kinda flat.

I do not like puzzle-like games neither abstracts very much. So, this actually rates quite high for me when belonging to both mentioned categories.
Even increased a bit after several plays.
After 150+ plays the rating decreased from 8 to 7.5. I still think it's a good game, but simply would like to play other unplayed things. As a 2-player game I would rate it 9 (as it is less luck dependant).
Again increased to 8, I just wouldn't suggest it for 4 players (maybe only with the team play which adds some additional challenge).

A simple abstract where you lay tiles to match up coloured symbols. You have a different scoring track for each unique symbol; the symbol you scored the worst for is your final score. Do you cap off a run of symbols to prevent others from cashing in, or do you keep a chain going in hopes that you can score multiple times? Long term planning is limited, though there is plenty of opportunity to make decisions. Some randomness in the tile draw, though superior play should overcome any luck inherent in the game. I always want to play this one "one more time."

A clever abstact with the usual Reiner twist. Players play tiles with 2 of 6 symbols from their pool of 6. Each turn, they place a tile and score 1 point for linking like colours in a row or adjacent to the new tile. Once the board is full, the game ends and players look at their weakest scoring colour...and in T&E style, the one with the highest scoring lowest colour wins!

The game is a fairly fast playing abstract that offers a good amount of tension, nasty play and thought. Very elegant. I like it...which is saying a lot considering that abstracts and kniza is a combination I'd usually avoid.

RATING: 7
First impression: Not only is Ingenious the best multiplayer abstract I've ever played, but it's a fun game that can hold its own against non-abstracts. It's also loads of fun with two, but it suffers from chance elements so much that games are often decided by it. Chance in an abstract is a double-edged sword, as on the one hand it makes the game more engaging to a broader audience, introduces a great amount of tension, and ensures variety; but on the other hand you can get screwed by the draw. This especially hurts in a two player game. In such a game, each player can play more or less optimally, and the winner can be mostly decided by tile draws in the late game. This makes the game unsatisfactory even for the winner, as it's no fun to win when this is obviously the result of luck - not in an abstract, at any rate. The best way to mitigate the chance element is to play 4 players with teams. In this case, each team has a total of 12 tiles. But the most fun to be had with this game is with the regular 3 and 4 person games. Luck still plays a role, but sort of screws everyone equally - or at least it feels that way!

Ingenious shares some qualities with Knizia's Tigris and Euphrates, notably the victory condition (you win by ensuring that your lowest scoring color/shape is higher than everyone else's lowest color/shape), but also somewhat in the tile drawing and laying departments. Your choices in Ingenious are much more constrained than they are in T&E, however, and so Ingenious is not nearly as meaty a game. But because it's a fun, light abstract, most of the groups I play with are going to prefer Ingenious to T&E (even though I think the latter is a more satisfying game).

For a two player abstract, I prefer YINSH or Go, both of which I enjoy a lot. But if you like a bit of luck, you'll probably prefer Ingenious even for two players.

Update (after many, many plays): Okay, my initial take on this game was a bit off. I think the two player game is the best way to play Ingenious. With three and four players, luck of the draw plays a more vital role, making the game a bit more chaotic. With more players, skillful play is not rewarded as consistently as it is in a two player game. I like Ingenious as a light, fun end of the day kind of game. You can play it purely on instinct, which is great for when your brain is fried or you are tired - and it serves well as a way to wind down the day with my wife. It's also a great abstract to play with kids - in a multiplayer situation, they actually have a chance to win.

My almost-6-year-old loves to play this game too, and she does pretty well at it.

I think you can play this game at a couple of levels: either, play a tile at a time, or, look two or three turns ahead and set up a really big score, making it a fabulous game for both casual and serious gamers alike.

I love this game. After 2 plays I'm definitely going to buy it. It's so simple it can be played and taught to anyone, but holds a depth that will ensure replay over and over. Goes right up there with Blokus for me and might even dislodge it from the pedastal...we'll see..

I dunno, kinda boring, but I played this with three, and it may play better with 2 so I can actually focus more on blocking my opponent and plan ahead, but I still think wouldn't like it.

2 player may have yielded a better score, so benefit of the doubt rating would be "5", but this game is dull enough that I don't care about giving it a fair shake.

This is a nice little abstract that comfortably expands into a multiplayer game.  Nothing too exciting here, but there are some fun choices.  Not sure how much planning this game allows for, but it offers some nice tactical choices. A decent time killer.  Will never be all that great to me as it has the same irritating scoring system as E&T.  It does factor in the free tile draw option if you don't have any of you lowest color.  If you don't draw the right colors at the right time you won't be able to score them.  Hence the game can get irritating as you wait for the "right draw".

Had high hopes for this game from the description and reviews.  Unless I'm missing something, there doesn't feel like a whole lot of strategy and choice, and things don't seem to get gamey until near the end.  Positives:  anyone can play, game goes pretty fast, rules are simple, and it's fun to score the bonus by getting one color at the end of the scoring track.

I want to like Ingenious more than I actually do.  The problem is the luck of the draw.  That has much more influence on the game than any strategy or excellent placement.  Last night I saw a total beginner get Ingenious in all 6 colors!  I noticed that it was partly due to the other players handing it to him on a platter though.

There was a time when I wouldn't even consider these sorts of abstract tile laying games and suddenly I find myself playing and enjoying them all the time (Ingenious, Blokus, Ponte del Diavolo).

nice little abstract that only takes a minute to teach. like with other Knizia's, your score is the lowest of your colors. this clever scoring really makes the game. you need to interfere with your opponent's plans, or else this game just comes down to luck of the draw (literally, what colors you draw). i love the beautiful patterns that are revealed during play

Played it with two players only.

I like the game. It's clever (once again) and it gives players a good opportunity to draw a strategy without being too much heavy and too much brain burner. Colors give some light to the otherwise awful board. I don't like the components because I don't usually like plastic but they are functional no question about it.

Also a catchy game for newbies and something that we can easily teach to a 7/8 year old child.

Scoring system has written Knizia all over it which is does not have to be a bad thing. It works! 

Played the game with 3 players for the first time and had to rank it down one point. This game should have been made for 2 players only IMO. I don't want to play it differently anymore because the way things are supposed to work are simply better with 2 players. In my only single play with 3 players one of the players had to chose one player to give the victory to. King making by definition. Not for me.

One of Knizia's best, and a brightly colored abstract! You score on six color tracks depending on how you place each double hex tile, and the highest lowest score wins, as is Knizia's trademark.

The title turned me off just a bit, but the game is solid. Hex dominoes earn points for the colour/shape chains they make when placed and only your lowest scoring colour counts. It's puzzle-like with the potential for opponent blocking as the board gets close to full.

Reiner Knizia has many, many excellent games, but of them all, this is my wife's favorite. I picked this and another game off the shelf at my FLGS and let her pick one. She picked this and while I hadn't played it before, I'd her some good things about it. With a bit of a pout, put the other game back on the shelf. Good thing I did! Ingenious is excellent, for 2, 3 or 4 players. With couple friends, gaming buddies and family this has been met with a positive reception. In fact this comment reminds me that I should bring it to my parents more often, they enjoyed it and they complain that I try to teach them too many new games, so they don't get a chance to really learn them.

Great abstract.  I cant tell how much of this is luck based yet, but it seems like you can play "better" than your opponent by making good choices with what tiles you have.  And you can strategically block your opponent to keep their score low.

This has been a big hit 2 player, but havent gotten a multi-player game together yet.

Update after 50+ 2-player plays against the iPad AI:  This game is insanely addictive, and the ipad beats me about 40-50% of the time.  I love it.

Update:  After over 100 plays on the iPad, some subtle strategic maneurvering starts to pay huge dividends.  You start to see how to score 5 points on a play instead of 4, which adds up later when the games are always close.  You start to watch the other guy's score more closely to seal off certain colors from being scored further.  You start to really watch both scores to plan your next move.  You learn to score a certain color at the same time as your opponent to stay ahead of him on each color.  All great stuff.

Wow, a Knizia game I really like.  This abstract strategy game has the same overall attraction that Blokus has (IMO).  The rules are VERY easy to learn and the game plays pretty quick, but there is definitely a bit of strategy here.  The only gripe I have is you can have bad luck and just not get many tiles of a particular color (I only got 3 yellow tiles one game), meaning your score is going to be very low b/c your score is determined by whichever color you score lowest on.  One possible remedy might be to score your second to worst color, but I have not tried that yet.  Despite this gripe, I like the game a lot and think it's an excellent game, particularly if you like Blokus.

[FFG 'Ingenious' 2004 edition] {Abstract, couple; pattern-building, partnership} Ingenious is a nice abstract game for families because it's easy to learn and play. Besides, it has nice user interaction. And it's tight and exciting most of the time due to the hidden tile information.

Ingenious is a good gateway game in abstract domain. It's not a perfect-information game; thus, the size of decision tree is limited and players are forced to take calculated risks. As a result, Ingenious is a fast-paced game without the deep analysis-thinking.  In addition, scoring happens each turn and it's easier for player to visualize and understand the board, unlike other deep abstract games in which the game situation is usually opaque until late game.

As said, Ingenious is not a genuine abstract game, which should have perfect information. Player needs a little luck in drawing tiles.  Its uniqueness is built around the special scoring rule (though it is clearly derived from E&T). Due to its scoring rule, Ingenious is tight enough that all players have certain chance to win, even though they are lagging behind. This dynamic nature of Ingenious may upset the pure-abstract game lovers, though.

Players have several directions of decision each time, but not agonizing: rising inferior color, shooting for 'ingenious', developing a new base, trying to flush your hand, blocking others, or developing other spaces? Reserving high-score color at late game to score for 'Ingenious' to take multiple moves at late game?

Game parts are of good quality and durable except the game trays and game board should be shaped to hold the game pieces more firmly.

Beautiful abstract with the same challenging scoring as Tigris & Euphrates. While I've played it face to face only a couple of times, I've played the PC version to death... http://www.marquand.net/index.php?topic=ingenious

Much like it's name this game is ingenious.  It's pretty fast and well constructed.  Play is seemingly straight forward.  I'll play it occcasionally, but is dry like most abstracts are.

I was surprised at how much I like this one. The game is quite light, very quick to play and the rules are very easy to learn and teach (rulesexplanation is easily done in 5 minutes). The startgame is often slightly repetitive but tension grows greatly towards the end when big scores and blocking becomes possible.

The best part of this game is doing the Dr. Evil pinky thing as you say, "Ingenious!"  Other than that, pretty dry and not really that challenging as a mental game--maximize your points early on and your scarcities late game (unless you can be Ingenious) and most of it will come down to screwage (intended or otherwise) and your tile draws.

I love themed games. My collection is themed games, but I picked this up for a good price. I have to say it is easy to play, but can be used as a more competitive game amongst skilled players. I've had some very good sessions with this where a game is won with the very final move. I'm also glad that (despite liking themed games) Knizia didn't tack on a theme.
A great balance of fun and strategy that can be taught in minutes, and played to a good standard on about the third game. We also find that each game only takes about 20 minutes.

Really good abstract strategy game.  Strategy is non-obvious.  Player interaction is high.  And it even works as a solitaire game.  I just wish it had a molded board that held the pieces in place (like Blokus).  They slide too easily.
Update: I hear there's a travel version in the works.  Will it have a molded board?  I hope so!

WOW!  I'm totally addicted to this game!  Easy to learn.  Adapts very well to 3-4 player games, but works best at 2-player.  The official solitare variant sucks because you immediately place the random tile you draw.  I play the solitare variant using the normal 6-tile rack rules -- it's less frustrating.

Normally I don't care much for abstract games, but this one appeals to me strongly.  Maybe it's the little wooden scoring cubes ...  Can be quite frustrating since moves that are really good for you often set up your opponents for an even better one.

RATING: 6.5
I don't know why, but I find this game insanely easy. I wish there was more complexity to it or that there was more depth or something, but as it stands I almost always seem to win without any effort, thinking, or planning ahead.

EDIT: After playing it again for the first time in 5 years it still feels pretty easy. Maybe a bit more luck based and with 4 players it can result in "the worst player gives the game to the person after them" which happened. It is a fun game but not much to it in my eyes.

Knizia's Ingenious has interesting scoring mechanic: you must increase the score of your lowest scoring color/shape on the board and match it with the scores to move ahead in overall victory points. This creates a current that pushes game play and adds a bit of tension to an abstract game.

One of the greatest abstracts I've ever played.  Works incredibly well for 2, 3, or 4 players.  Doesn't outstay its welcome in any way.  Very easy to learn, hard to master.  I love the scoring system in this game.

My only complaint is that the scoring is a bit tricky for new players.  Once you get the hang of it then you're golden.

Great and simple game. Can be a great gateway game for non-gamers. Easy to learn, fun to play. Plays well with 2-4 players. Scoring ( easy for me ) is a bit hard for some players. Hard to tell why.

Not a bad game but as dry as most abstracts are. Tedious scoring mechanism reminding me of Euphrates & Tigris. Didn't like it there and don't like it now. Worse, it is the whole mechanic this game revolves about.

Not my cup of tea. If you like Euphrates & Tigris but could do away with much of the fluff of that game, this is the game for you.

Won't beat my own favorite abstract: Hive.

Traded it away in the 2013 Essen math trade.

Setup is lightning fast, play time is quick. The game is about making the best decision turn after turn.

It is ingenious, but is it any fun?

Kinda.

Update: I'm willing to give this game 'pretty clever', but still not quite the title of 'Ingenious'. I still feel like it is more an interesting game than a fun game. The blocking really becomes the key strategy and so depriving others of scoring is more important than maximising your own score.

RATING: 7
Something like domino with the scoring from Tigris & Euphrates. You try to put colored tiles, to lines in this color. So longer the lines, so more points you score. But your score at the end of a game is the score in your worst colour. 

When you have a maximum in some colour you have a bonus move. It`s very good and you should try to have a bonus move.

The game is random, but fast and you should think plying it.

Oh why won't the people I play with block in this game? Not sure we play with the right tactics because people tend to make plays that score big points and the next person scores an even bigger play off of that.

I've found it to really be a good two, three, and four player game - best with four players in teams of two. Interesting abstract game with classic Knizia scoring system - your best low score determines winner. But wait, if you max out a color, you get a bonus turn, so there is an incentive to go nuts on at least one color. But again, if you do that, you may leave on color too far back. I've dropped the rating slightly after playing the computer version a lot. There is a lot of luck despite having a selection of tiles. Get the right string of tiles, and you can shut people out while running the board and there is nothing that can be done. Not as bad when playing teams because a bad run for you isn't as likely to happen at the same time to your partner.

Fantastic strategy game. The rules are quickly understood but I must admit that all the strategic elements took a while to reveal themselves to me - the game has got better as I have understood it more. 

There are many aspects to it, you might choose to attempt to sabotage one or more opponents or you can concentrate on your own game. It's very dynamic as you can plan a couple of moves ahead but the actions of an opponent can change your plans quite quickly. 

Best played, in my opinion, with three players.

I'd rather play Tigris and Euphrates (which seems similar but more complex). A good family game on the more tactical/puzzle end of the gaming spectrum. I once thought that Qwirkle had replaced Ingenious for me. Not true. The novelty wore off, and Ingenious has proven to be the better game. In any case, my wife enjoys the game, and so I'll be hanging onto it.

RATING: 6
Ingenious is fairly unique in that it is an abstract that can handle a scalable number of players from one to four.  With more than two players, however, the problem is that the board changes too much from the time you make one play to the time you get to play again.  I guess it's just a matter of getting used to it, but I find it hard to plan ahead for that reason.  I think with three or four, I'd rather play something with more theme.

Played a couple games with my wife who was really excited about it as she loves abstract games.  All she could say after two games was "meh".  I agreed.  There was something really lackluster trying to keep the lowest color on your pegboard from being the last.  The game didn't thrill us or fill us with the idea that there was some master strategy.  Not a bad game, but defintely no where near as good as some people seem to think the game is.

I enjoy this even though I usually don't like puzzle games.  I like that you compare the lowest scores to see who wins.  That forces you to try to score in all colors.  Perhaps that reminds me of Tigris and Euphrates, which is a game by the same designer that I enjoy.

RATING: 7.5
This is a thoughtful abstract and, typical for a Knizia game, has unique scoring to give it its twist.  I tend to appreciate abstracts that play with more than two and handle that well, and this one does that.

In 95 % of the games I played it came down to the very last tile drawn. Either you were lucky with the draw or you weren't. Figure how good I think that is!

RATING: 8
This baby's a harsh mistress. It can give a big hug one turn, and punch in the face the next. It can be as simple or as complex as you like it to be. It can be an all-out scorefest or a drawn-out war of attrition.

I love the fact that after dozens of 2-player games, I can still discover new ways of playing, and layers of complexity become apparent.

However, luck of the draw becomes more prominent at endgame, especially in 3- or 4-player games. So much so that between players of a similar level, the winner will be more than likely determined by lucky or unlucky draws. That's a bit disheartening, especially when you happen to win by not playing optimally and you lose when trying hard to work something out.

I'll play a game anytime, with any number of players.

27-AUG-2012: Upgraded to 7.5 and mainly 2 player games.

27-DEC-2012: Upgraded to 8.

I like it, but not nearly as much as some of my other abstracts such as Yinsh and Through the Desert.

I got this because I realized a while back that I didn't have any really good abstracts in my collection.

After a few plays, it has fallen flat for me. I think a better abstract may be Through the Desert. I've played both Ingenious and Through the Desert at least a dozen times on the iPad now, and I find myself going back to Through the Desert before this one. I think I'll put it up for trade. Sad, I really wanted to like this one. In the end, it's just not that challenging. Decisions are usually pretty obvious and the tiles play themselves out the way they're drawn.

RATING: 6.75
There are several reasons to like this game - the winning condition (score your lowest color) makes for challenging decisions; the solitaire variant and puzzles add flexibility (and make it a great game to bring early to a public game night); and it's a non-threatening abstract for new gamers.  The attractive color and design of the pieces are a draw, and the fact that there is no elimination or isolation lets everyone stay in the game and be reasonably competitive from their first play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Gets an extra rating point because it plays well solitaire. The endgame can be somewhat anticlimatic, as it is usually apparent who is going to win. Still, it's a fun ride, and plays in 20-30 minutes. Best with four playing in partnerships.

"Judicious assholery" is probably the dominant strategy.  Perhaps for that reason, I especially dislike this game with 3 or 4 players (unless playing the 2v2 team variant).  But it's a great game for two.

RATING: 8
I like to buy almost any game with a solitaire variant, why? I thinks its just that I can't get enough people to play a board game with me on a regular basis, so I end up playing by myself most nights. Sad I know... However, Ingenius is hyped as an "Amazing Game", but I'm not sure there is anything amazing about it. Ok so you score with your lowest scoring color, is that what's so amazing? The components are great though and it plays like a abstract version of Scrabble, which is great if you're like 4. I really don't get what's so great about this game.

Nifty little abstract that plays quickly and lightly.  Nice skillful game. I'd like to try out the partnership variant, because all partnership variants are cool.  Scoring is a bit wacky to get used to, but  still very manageable.  It plays much lighter than it is(which is a good thing).  After 10 plays its getting a bump.  Its not the greatest game ever, but with two players it has fun decisions.  Limit your opponents ingeniouses, block off the opponents lowest, set up your own ingeniouses.  Its probably loses a point with each player added, but its quite the fun 2 player game.  For some reason, I just can't figure out the proper balance between offense and defense.  I'm always too skewed in one direction.  Just another reason why the game is fun.

One of my most played games of all time even though I didn't even own a copy for the longest time.  I play this a lot on BSW because it's always possible to get in a game, and it's quick.  I like playing with 2 players, or with 4 players divided into two teams.  I don't usually enjoy pure abstract games very much, but this and Blokus have grown on me with repeated plays.  I suppose part of the reason I like this game is the Reiner Knizia Tigris & Euphrates style scoring system.  Finally got a copy of this after playing it online 37 times!

Ingenious, I love this Reiner Knizia game. Simple enough to learn in a minute. Balance of color spheres is the winning key (more intuitively implemented than in Euphrat & Tigris). Strategies are three-folded. Taking points of your weak colors to secure the game or taking points of strong colors to gain extra moves? And when playing with geniuses, making moves to ruin rival's plan?

I like the partnership game mode.

Although I am not a huge fan of abstracts, I found this one to be very addictive. It helps that, although the game taxes the brain, it is not overly prone to analysis paralysis, because the luck factor (the drawing of new tiles) is just right. Actually, everything about this game is extremely well balanced. Hence it does not feel as "dry" as some other abstracts out there. Totally recommended for 2-4 players, as it plays equally well with 2 as it plays with 4. Did I mention that the components are of an extremely high quality?

Played at PrezCon 05.  I enjoyed this one, so I probably need to give up on my preconceptions about abstract games.  Sooooo many abstract games are perfect information 2 player games that I really needed to try something outside that mold.  This game plays fairly quickly, and as usual, I enjoy the Knizia balanced scoring mechanism.  I got a 2 and a 4 player game in, and I think the variable board size for the number of players is very nice, too.  It seems nicely balanced for different numbers of players.  I think I may be biased, though.  I generally enjoy theme in a game, and my interest in Genial is muted by the abstract nature.  It was good fun, and given time, my interest level could sneak up on me.

As I suspected, this game has continued to grow on me.  Any disinterest I had due to it's abstract nature is gone now.

It's hard to dislike Einfach Genial but I can't imagine getting too excited about it. The beginning is simply boring but the tension increases gradually. 
Unfortunately the most interesting part of the game(near the end) doesn't last very long. There's also some kind of correlation between your and your opponents score i don't like that much. In most cases if you score high in one colour your neighbour gets the chance to do the same in his turn. Blocking your opponent instead and depriving him of his choices also leads to less spectacular scores for you.

Abstract tile-placement strategy game easily scalable for 2 to 4 players that is also playable in partnership or as a solitaire puzzle. The goal is to score points by positioning tile colors/symbols adjacent to similar ones already on the board. Balance in scoring is primordial as your final score is equal to your worst scoring color/symbol. Easy to learn but extremely solid. Tile draws maintain a level of randomness that forces players to adapt and increases replayability. Should appeal to many categories of gamers - use as a family or gateway game or with seasoned players. Component quality is top-notch.

Great simple abstract game for kids 6 and up.

One of my favorite abstract games, from Reiner Knizia, where you place tiles and try to get the most connections of the same color placing them. There's a great app for this to play on your cell phone as well.

There is something almost relaxing about Ingenious. Unlike many other abstracts (for example Yinsh, which melted part of my brain last week) there is little pressure to try to think ahead or visualize board development. I am sure that one could play Ingenious that way, but the game itself lulls the players into an easy gait, a lazy "summer on the front porch swing" kind of playing. I've now seen the game approached with both relentless, bitter blocking, and alternatively an almost gentle cooperation-- and even at both of these extremes the game still feels soft, casual. I cannot pinpoint what part of the system softens the edges; I don't think it is the luck of the tile draw. It is more as if, since there are so many ways to score so many things, there is a feel good vibe however one plays. No matter what you do (practically) there is the warm-fuzzy of moving cubes, of building something. While this is probably reading too much into things, there is also something warm and fuzzy about winning with your loser: it is as if the narrative drive of the game gets everyone focused on the hollywood-esque goal of making the underdog do-good. I think it is this gentleness, the warmth of the game if you will, that makes it such a perfect game to bring out with non-gamers. I had an old curmudgeon math teacher who liked to complain that "most people would rather die than think. And most do." Ingenious is a great game for most: you can play it without thinking too much and not have an embarrassing result. This is amplified by the winning condition focusing on the losing piece. In many ways I'd like to give this a 9 or a 10: you can teach it in under 5 minutes, a very broad spectrum of people will enjoy it, and there are interesting decisions along the way. But what keeps this from that lofty rating is that it isn't something I'd pull out with gamers. There just isn't enough tension. Its softness is, well, too soft. But if I can only pack one or two games for a mixed crowd, this probably would be in the bag.

$1.99 thrift find... would not buy this otherwise. Fantasy Flight Games English edition (2004) | English.

An okay game that takes considerably more than 12 seconds to learn. Plays well with 2 or 3 (prefer 2, as always). So many high ratings for this adds to the WTF factor, and confirms the fact: that I don't know who you people are. Are you really people? Ah... there you are, and continuing on, around page 101.

Why is my rating going up?  This game stands the test of time.  It has no theme that's going to be "last year's news" and no artwork that's going to become obsolete.  It's simple.  It's easy to teach to anyone.  It can be competitive enough to challenge seasoned gamers.  It works well at all player counts.  Yes, there can often be one player who excels and puts everyone else to shame, so you need to consider the dynamics of the group.  Don't play it with a sore loser who wants to quit the second someone pulls ahead, but do play it with people who see competition as a reason to up effort!   Ingenious is definitely one of my favorite games within the abstract genre.

Original, Dec 2016:
I give it a 6 only because I don't enjoy it as well as numerous other games.  It's a blend of strategy and luck of the draw, which a decent balance of both.  However, it is a game that gets boring to me if played too often.  It feels like a light and easy game until I play it with someone who heavily dominates, making me just wish it would end faster.  I don't mind losing, but I hate feeling like there's no possible strategy that could help me recover.

Would probably be a nice gateway game for kids or adults alike, as the rules are very quick and easy to teach.  My parents love this one and have also added it to their collection.

RATING: 6
This is a decent game as long as it stays fast.  It's definitely easy to teach, and has some depth.  In other words, just what you want from a multiplayer abstract.  I think that it may be just a hair too luck-driven between players of similar skill levels, as you can get shafted on the tile draw.  Still, this game's ability to present a multiplayer abstract to non-gamers is probably unmatched.  The only things I can think of that are close to it are Through the Desert, Samurai (both also Knizia creations) and Blokus.  Still, I have to admit that I am pretty wishy-washy on it.  Abstracts are just not what get me, and I am not likely to ask for this one very often.  Due to it's easy rules and fast play, I play this one now and again.

Ingenious is really a stroke of genius, even for a designer like Knizia.  This unthemed abstract of making rows is tons of fun, once the players learn the rules.  Loved by gamers and non-gamers alike, scales well from 2-4.

Rated after 14 games, I have played this with two players and with four players. Interestingly game works really good on both scenarios, which is quite rare. I really like this game, it is just so simple (pun intended), fast and challenging. A theme would not do bad, but I can live with that.

Updated after 18 plays, still a good game. It is lacking the social aspect, players are just silently staring the board, which means this is not a game for all situations. But, still very good.

Immensely good as a gateway game. Best with 2 (or with two teams of 2). The strategy consists in getting ahead in a color and then blocking it from being available on the board. If this is your opponent's lowest color he will be scrambling to get more of it before game end. Of course the same can be done to you. Luck plays a role of course but considering the time commitment it isn't really an issue.

Knizia; Category: Abstract Strategy; Mechanics: Tile Placement, Pattern Building,Hand Management; When a player placed a piece, they are trying to line up multiples of the same symbol. When you do so, you score points for that symbol, which is tracked on your player mat. If you max out your score in a particular color, you get an extra turn. Now here's the twist: at the end of the game, everyone compares their LOWEST score and that's their ending score. So if you end the game with 18 in everything except red which has 12, your score is twelve. (If you've played Tigris and Euphrates, you've seen this before.)

RATING: 5
There's less of an issue with the luck of the draw than I first realized, thanks to the "dump your tiles for all new ones if you don't have a tile with your lowest-scoring color" rule.  The real issue of the game is that it's too easy to get blocked out of a color you need, but that's a principle part of how the game develops, so I don't see it as a problem.  Like most abstract strategy games, it's better with 2 players, but I haven't tried the game with the partnership rule.  The only thing keeping this from an 8 is that it's just a tad too dry for my tastes.

Good abstract strategy game; my rating is probably harsher than it deserves, as abstract games are not typically of much interest to me.

Anyone who knows a little about Reiner Knizia’s games will know that the good Doctor loves games that deal with trying to get points in various different categories and then only score that category in which the player has the fewest. In the past, Knizia has used this mechanic to develop highly complicated games, but with Einfach Genial, he has distilled the mechanic down to its purest form.
\13\\13\
The game is played on a hex board. 120 equally sized pieces, each consisting of two joined hexes, come with the game. There are symbols on each hex that make up the piece - some pieces have two identical symbols, some have two different symbols (not unlike dominoes). The goal of the game is, through clever placement, to obtain points in the different symbol colors. Points are claimed by placing a piece such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol.
\13\\13\
The game ends when no more tiles can be placed onto the board or when a player reaches the maximum number in every color. Now each player looks to see how many points they scored in the colour they 'scored the least'. Whoever has the most points in their least-scored colour is the winner. Simple.

I was originally interested in this game because it was one of those rare things: a multiplayer abstract. It was amazing how quick it was to pick up. It plays pretty quickly, but can be subject to "analysis paralysis". Works well at 2 or 3. I haven't tried 3 or 4 yet. There's a bit of luck of he draw, but there are ways to mitigate that.

Fun,  easy to pick up game.   Simple rules.  The "score your lowest color" is always a tricky thing.   Scoring the tiles takes a little explaining,  but otherwise the rules are dead easy,  but everyone usually agrees that there's lots of strategy.The board is ...uh...plain (which is really just a kind way of saying that it is very,  very ugly).  The pieces are plastic,  and although a bit lightweight,  they're quite nice.  Would have been nice to have a plastic board with grooves like Blokus.  Score sheets are also on nice,  thick stock but share the aesthetics of the board.  I think it's the off-white color, that makes them look like poor paper photocopies.  Scoring cubes are a bit small - be careful, a good jostle would send everything flying.

Inventoried the tiles - there 5 of each of the double-coloured ones (5x6),  and 6 of all the other types (6x15).

Wonderful in 2, 3 or players, no matter. Super simple rules, strategic planning, tough decisions, tactical tricks, fast. All kind of people can play it and appreciate it. Luck is surely present and can play against a single player as to make him/her lose the game but in this case you just "wasted" a 20 minutes game, not a 2 hours experience: you can immediately play another game and luck could be on your side.

Whoa... I can have half scores? That's awesome.
In any case, I like this game. It reminds me a little bit of Mastermind. It's simple, quick, fun, you can screw over opponents, it gets tougher as you go, it requires strategy (I still ALWAYS miscount and end up winning but just because my boyfriend helps me find the optimal configuration- but I'll get the hang of it, that's the best part of the game!) but is also pretty heavily dependent on chance (which personally, I like). Great game overall!

Decent abstract game by Reiner Kinezia.  Nice enough bits--gamers have a natural affinity towards hexagons, don't they?  The usual "your lowest scoring category is your score for the game" victory condition.  I'm not a big abstract guy, so this one's only OK in my book.

An abstract Knizia that tries to lure you in with pretty colors and shapes. The scoring system is the best part of this game for me. Your lowest score is more important than your highest score, and that leads to a sense of urgency during the end game.

Family game but still interesting enough to make it one of my most played. Plays well with 2-4. Your lowest score is what counts which is a great scoring mechanic.

After playing this a lot over a couple of years, rarely sees the table now as my collection always seems to have so many unplayed games. Keeper.

Although this is an abstract game I don't feel it's a brain-burner.  A little more luck involved because of tile draw.  This game fills a puzzles and patterns niche for me.

purchased 040505 has that good old scoring system of T&E, but is really the only similarity with that great game. I like this as well, and there are a few strategies that become apparent after a few games. Have only played 3 plyr so far and look forward to partnership play with 4

This and Blokus seem to be the only new abstracts to have widespread success in the modern gaming era.

How you do is incredibly dependent on how well the previous players set you up to score (or not).  If a particular person - or the group - wants to shut you down, there's not a lot that you can do except put on a pretty face and continue to play.  That's where partner-play comes in: to turn that frown upside down and make that smile genuine.

RATING: 10
Played numerous times face-to-face, and hundreds of times on BSW (mainly with 2). I liked my first play of that game, but did not suspect I would like it that much after so many plays. The rules are really simple, the game is rather nice-looking (I am aware that could be discussed), the luck factor is reduced a lot by the possibility to change your tiles (which is much more useful than some people seem to imagine), and the game plays rather quickly, turning it into a very nice filler. Also, the board scales very well (although I much prefer playing with 2, or with teams, to prevent "blocking responsibility" problems). Overall, a simple, yet impressively enjoyable design.

RATING: 7
Excellent family game. Fun for games, nongamers, adults, and children alike. Tempted to bump it up a notch (to an 8) because of its wide appeal, but in all honesty, it really is a "7" (=usually willing to play) for me, it's just an 8+ for "need to own" since it is so appealing to other people also.

A really good abstract. I have played this many times. I can play this with almost anybody and they enjoy it. Can be played on several different levels. I like to play it with a focus on accumulating points with less experienced gamers and I focus more on the blocking aspects when playing with more experienced or competitive gamers. I think this will become a classic abstract.

This is not a perfect information game. There is a large amount of luck in the draw of tiles. This is unpleasent to some people but makes the game easy to introduce to novice game players.

RATING: 7
This game has gone over well with wife, kids, and grandmother.  It takes a few examples to understand the scoring, but then everyone is on an even playing field.  I probably wouldn't play this with gamers since we could play something else that hits the table less often.

One of the few abstracts I genuinely like.  Easy enough that anyone can play, score points, and feel competitive.  It doesn't feel so open-ended that it's entirely about strategic thinking and allows people like me, who hate games like that, to do well and fun.  Even my wife enjoyed this one.  Seems to scale between 2 and 4 just fine.

Great game that needs a board to lock down pieces a la Blokus.  Saw there is a travel edition for two after I picked up the full version.

After a couple more plays, I have upped my rating.  There is a deep strategy to this game only seen after several plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The main concept behind the game is very simple yet there is enough variety and randomness to keep all players interested. 

The scoring method forces players to keep a balance between all colours, though this has to be balanced against hitting the full score for one or more colours, so as to get that valuable extra turn.

The main complaint has to be the playing board, which is a level cardboard. It would have been nice to have some grooves to hold the pieces in place. Take care not to bump the table or the pieces may slide off the playing board.

Very clever, very simple abstract game with wonderful components, easily grasped rules, and compelling decisions.

Love it.

What a wonderful game. Beautiful 2-player game, but scales well. For anything but a 4-player game I prefer this over Blokus. I've played it with a couple of 8-year olds without any trouble, and actually got beat by one of them. There's strategy on a lot of levels in this one, and it's a very entertaining game. Hard to play just once.

This is a very fun, nice looking abstract game where you get points by connecting lines of tiles.  An easy to set up, fast playing game with simple rules and a fair amount of strategy. I like the scoring twist: player with the most points in their least scored color wins so you can't totally ignore any colors (but comparing your scores to your opponents will let you know when you can start ignoring something!).  And it scales well from Solitaire to 4 players (unlike Blokus which only seems to work well for 4 and okay for 2)  Definitely will continue to get plenty of play at our house!

RATING: 6
So far I'm lukewarm about the game. It's a nice 30 minute diversion, but I fail to see any deeper strategy beyond just maximizing your score every turn.

Very simple and elegant gameplay.  However, it's quite deceptive in the fact that being in the lead for most of game does not necessarily means you'll even finish close to the top.  I don't know whether to attribute that as brilliance or just the luck of the draw.  Definitely require more plays to get a better feel for it.

My wife fell in love with the computer version that we got for free.  I like it too, so she didn't have to twist my arm when she finally found it at the FLGS.  I think we should play it with  other people in the future as she likes to play nice.  She can be mean when it is a computer, but when I pull something on her, I get "the look."

The game is kinda okay. Its lack of theme is a down side but that does not matter much. However, what matters is, that there is not much of a game here for me. The game just 'happens'. I do not like trying to think many moves ahead, when the other players screw your plans anyway. So it is just each turn doing your best with the tiles you have without planning for future.

I played Ingenious with 2, 3 and 4 and couldn't find anything very spactacular about it.  I don't think it's a bad game, it just wasn't fun for me.  I found the shapes and colors to be somewhat abrasive to my senses, and I didn't care for the plasticiness of the pieces.  Blokus or the Gipf series are way better abstract games.

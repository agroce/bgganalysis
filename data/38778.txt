RATING: 4
A rating of 4 might seem harsh but I rate by the BGG ratings descriptions and this sums the game up perfectly for me, but after only one 5 player game. We may have missed something crucial but we called it a day after round 2, as round 3 seemed to offer little but assasinations and replacement nobles? Also, I have some colour blindness and it was tough for me to try to see what was happening on the board. So, pleased to have given it a try but it's not really one for me.

RATING: 5
An area control game with set collection and backstabbing.  Different scoring/valuations for each region.  The set collection aspect (nobles) also provides scoring.

Definitely an interesting mix with potential, but it didn't hook me at all.  A lot of opportunities for push-pull.  The card draw affects everything and can help or hinder you.  The assassination having a 3/4 chance for success can be very frustrating.  A bit long.  Plenty of potential for AP.

Not a bad game, more likely just not my cup of tea.  I would play it (without too much griping) if others wanted to.

A very, very good area-control game, with awfully difficult decisions to be made every turn after about the second! And yes: it is AP heavy. Having several games of it under my belt now, I've come to the conclusion that Heads of State has loads of replayability, given the multitudes of strategic options one has, and the need to also think tactically with regards to the cards currently available. 

I think I'm one of the few people who likes the art: it does look dreadful here at The Geek, but in the cardboard, it looks quite nice. Practically speaking, however, the colours of the nobles are far too confusing, and some of the art is quite anachronistic (including the 21st century map!). Nevertheless, you do get the feeling that you're an early modern dynasty trying to spread your influence throughout Western Europe. I think, from looking at HoS's reincarnation, Royals, that the themeing is somewhat reduced in the newer game; but at least Royals is shorter: Heads of State is a little too long for what it offers, otherwise I would have rated it higher.

Imagine a game like Kardinal und Konig/Web of Power. Except that instead of a choice of three cards to draw from, you're given a choice of six. And one type of card is wild. And each type of card has multiple uses. Difficult decisions about card selection are all eliminated. Now increase the playing time from a snappy 45 minutes to a bloated 90 to 120 minutes. A real snoozer.

Reminds me of [gameid=491], which I didn't dislike.

The colors are confusing, which makes the game overview a bit difficult. Maybe the game is a bit long for what it is.

The use of historical figures would have been much appreciated by me!

However the game is worth another try.

Horrible horrible game. Hand size too small, too many different kinds of cards (9 different cards and you only can hold 10!) recruting/building costs horrid, take-that elemets, way too long and after the first game-year players are missing short term goals. Not going to play this again

This has the misfortune of having one of the worst examples of bad box art as you are likely to find. To compound matters the same terrible artwork is then used on the board and the cards.

If you ignore the artwork, oversized board and bland components there's actually a fairly decent game in here. A mix of set collection and area control although the game is perhaps a bit too long for what it is.

Remade as [i]Royals[/i] which looks to have improved everything. There's no need to ever seek out the original version now. Unless you are glutton for hideous artwork.

This is a 120 minute game, minimum.  It looks horrible with the poor graphics and clunky wooden bits.  The people images are not very clear on the board.  Icons would have served much better.

The game would have looked so much better if Michael Menzel (Thurn und Taxis) or Franz Vohwinkle had been afforded.  The card chits of T&T are so much nicer than the games wooden markers.  The cards for the nobles were pointless.  These were collected each time a noble was placed.  Why not simply count the tokens on the board at the end of the game or those left on the player boards.  We placed the noble tiles on top of the portraits on the information boards.  This was logical and could have been suggested by some better graphics.

As for the game its self, it has its own pace.  Year one, lay the pieces.  Year two, continue with skirmishes.  Year three, build up to some major assassinations.  I enjoyed the game.  The mechanics worked well.  It was a bit long for what it was, but was reasonably engaging.  Would play again, but not too soon.  Just a shame as it would have been easy to have made it so much better with a little more thought at the production stage.

Enjoy this game. Three distinct parts to it. Generally play just two player and it works quite well with this number. I bought two copies from The Works for a very good price, one of which I gave to my daughter and son-in-law. They really enjoy it too. Has to be played multiple times before some of the nuances of the game come to the surface.

RATING: 4.5
One of the worst Z-man productions. Yes I loved the many scoring mechanics and the wooden counters, but the graphic design and the treachery cards ruin the game. The graphic design actually makes the game impossible to play. You can't tell the colours or the nobles apart and it is very frustrating looking at the map of europe.

The worst graphic design I have ever seen in a game.

We have played this game numerous times, both with experienced game players and with family members who only occasionally play games.  The best thing about this game is that the rules are simple enough for people to understand and enjoy in a friendly social situation, however there is enough intrigue and treachery for even the most experienced game player to be satisfied.  It is amazing how many ways it is possible for a player to win and the game plays out differently every single time.  This game should do very well.

I have played this game quite a few times now and really enjoy it. Reminds me of a more advanced Cardinal and Kings. My favourite aspect is collecting the cards to build the various noble's you need to gain control of area's.
The real fun is the interaction between the players as each compete for control of the different countries. Adding up the points in your head to stay in front of your competitors. And of course using assassins or executing rival nobles. Lots of fun for four and five people and does not take too long to play. Each game is different as the various cards you draw will ultimately decide where your best strategy is. And the joy of executing a King to replace him with your own is always fun. The King is Dead, long live the King.

I have play tested this game and I must say I was hooked after the first session. Since then I have played it many times and have discussed many improvements with Peter. You learn it fast, it plays easy but allows for several strategies to win the game. The fact that points can be gathered in a multitude of ways reduces the luck factor of the cards. Most importantly it is fun to play and allows plenty of interactions with other players. It is probably too complex to make game of the year but for me it is in the top ten of my all time best list!

Area control war game with a remarkably well thought out scoring mechanism, which keeps the game interesting from start to finish. There's palpable tension in every move-- when we got up from the table you could almost feel the brain waves dissipating in the air. 
Also has one of the most well written rule books I have ever seen. The game looks intimidating from the box and bits, but I had no trouble teaching it to a total non-gamer in under 5 minutes-- and I had yet to ever actually play the game. 
Equal parts intense and fun.

In this game players are aristocratic families trying position their family into titles of nobility in western Europe.  The first half of the game is spent collecting nobility titles with one's family members.  Once most of the titles are claimed, the players will turn to murdering their opponent's family members in order to take over their titles.  The gameplay is pretty straightforward and a little dull.  Plus, the makers of this game seem to have photoshopped their own faces onto the images of various aristocrats; the effect is mildly gruesome.

So boring that 4 of 5 players wanted to quit half way through the game.

Collecting sets of cards to lay down influence. Zero originality.

Poor game mechanics. Improper scaling for turn order. Card drafting at its worst (not that card drafting is ever exciting) and a stupid assassination mechanic.

Overproduced, oversized cards, oversized reference card, redundant VP track & VP tokens, oversized board. None of it hides its overwhelming banality.

Only played once. A game of two halves where you first install family members in the noble houses of Europe and then assassinate your opponents' family members to make room for replacements.

Very well designed game with great mechanics. Be warned that it takes up massive amounts of table space. No kidding, my 3' x 5' table is only just barely big enough to contain this game, and even then, the players had to hold their cards and stuff on their laps, or off on side tables.

Also: Note the the art is sub-par. Some of it is okay, but mostly, it looks like the designer took photos of his friends,and photoshopped them (badly) onto old historical portraits. It doesn't take away from the great design, but I find my self wishing, the whole time I'm playing, that the art was just a little bit better.

Decent multi leyered scoring semi-area-majority game based on creating a network of nobles to control four European states.  Some concern that the biggest scores in the game simply go by player order, with the fourth player missing out badly.  I suspect the game may be different without that 'collect the set' incentive but wonder why it was added; other than as a final/different layer of scoring?

Oh dear. I bought this game on the recommendation of a couple friends and on the fact that Z-Man has been solid of late. Then I read the rules ... it was quickly apparent there wasn't anything of much interest here, and the reports of long playing times are doubly discouraging. Most likely this will never hit the table and I'll sell it unplayed.

One of the problems with the current Z-Man/Rio Grande situation is that it can "mask" the original publisher's brand with the Z-Man/RGG brand, which is not good. Heads of State is Eggert-Spiele, a brand I studiously avoid these days as they are really unreliable. But you'd never know that from looking at the box unless you looked quite closely. Had it been clear it was an Eggert game, I never would have bought it. Fortunately more solid brands (Hans im Gluck, Kosmos) tend to have their branding more prominently on their co-productions.

Played the first time at Essen. The Australian author kindly explained us the rules, which is much easier then reading them. The game has all the looks of a German-style resources game, but the assassination of monarchs and nobles (vive la guillotine!) makes the game very lively and fun to play. Great graphics, reminds me of Struggle of Empires and the game pieces are coloured wood. Our group definitely enjoyed the game.

The physical design of this game leaves a lot to be desired.  It doesn't make the the game unplayable, but it does make it extremely annoying.  The artwork borders on ridiculous.  There are usability issues which could have easily been avoided with very little effort and thought.

The game itself was okay, but for a 90-120 minute game I certainly was hoping for something more than okay.  It could have been stripped down further for a solid game at 60 minutes or more could have been done with the theme to justify the playing time.

In short, very disappointing.

The art on this is pretty bad/creepy... but that has nothing to do with the low rating.

Our 5-player game was horribly boring. Lots of downtime, and very few choices to make. Basically, you have a pool of 6 cards to choose 3 from (a little like Ticket to Ride). If you get the right combinations, you can place a person on the board.

Unlike Ticket to Ride, even figuring out which people you have (or can get) the right cards for takes a bit of time. You then have to search the board to see if that kind of person can even still be "built".

This is not the sort of game which can survive that level of randomness and downtime. (And don't even get me started on the Assassin card... which fails randomly 25% of the time.)

This game is tedious, plodding and boring. The creepy art is just the icing on the bleh-flavored cake.

Pretty good area influence game.  Have the most nobles in each country and score points.  Get bonus points for being the first noble in each city. Get more bonus points for placing in each city of the country.  Finally get bonus points for placing each noble type.  End-game, score points for each noble type where you have placed more than the other players.  When the board gets full, turns into a bit of "take that" with the assasination of nobles.  But I like it and would be happy to play again.

I've decided that while this game is best with 5, it has too much downtime.  Lowering a notch.

Update...way too much downtime with 5.  Game can take 3 hours to finish.

Game keeps dropping...down to 5.  The take-that is just too arbitrary.   I just don't enjoy playing this one much.  I suspect it will drop another point after my next play.

Scoring and play reminded me of a more cut-throat Thurn and Taxis on steroids. Made it richer, but some of the limits were frustrating. A set hand limit instead of flushing after playing a card made it difficult to get out the high value cards. High value cards once played got huge advantages, and were very entrenched - you couldn't kick them out without wasting two of your own turns. Might play one more time, but just feel like it needs more balancing.

Graphic and design choices really hamper this game. Score markers and player markers share colors which becomes a problem. It is hard to see what's going on when you look at the board. The price point seems crazy for the game. Underneath it, there's a basic game which, handled in a different way, would be elegant and cost significantly less. I'd give the game one or two more points if the design, layout and graphics didn't get in the way.

The bad and the ugly: It has the worst art choices I have ever seen. I can live with ugly (and this game has plenty of ugly), but my frustration is mainly because is very hard to try to figure out which piece is which and who it belongs to. It distracts too much from the game.
Bottom line: The game could be rated a little higher if it was not for the art.

Very over-produced game, the board is too big, the player tokens too indistinct, the nation bonuses and players use the same colours... plenty to be fixed in graphic design. But it plays nicely and was intriguing. We did not get to finish as one player had to leave, but we liked the flow and balance in the game. We certainly want to try it again.

You basically rip through the available bonuses as quickly as possible, secure control of nations, then start killing in order to develop. We liked the game play, moves were fast, the build up of cards was balanced. Nice game on an over-sized board.

RATING: 6.6
A blood thirsty game in the 16th to 18th centuries where royal dynasties use assassins, the Guillotine, Axemen, gallows, and the Spanish Inquisition to remove opposing nobles.

Attractive board and cards, and sturdy wood components.  However, the sets of Nobles are on thinner cardboard than most game tiles.  The tiles are not too thin and they don't detract from the game, but because the wood components are so nice, was surprised the tiles weren't sturdier.  

Plays well and moves along smoothly and quickly.  Lots of ways to score points, and end scoring is a good element of the game.  Hasn't been a lot of hype on the game and so was more impressed than I expected.  Looking forward to playing again, and so are the other players.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Area control with assassination. Awful components but straightfoward rules, perhaps subject to runaway leader. Can be prone to AP.

Duration: The card-draw dependency prevents you from planning during other players' turns. It should be quick but bad visual design makes it take a long time to sort out what you can and should do. Very little bookkeeping.
Design: Elegant, coherent area-control.  I also wonder about the longevity of the game, as it's always the same situation. A lot of points seem to be based on luck in drawing the cards you need to get first into an area and all nobles, compared to domination (which is more interesting).
Strategy: There may be too few interesting decisions relative to the work figuring out what you can do.
Production: The visual design is awful, you can't figure out which noble is which, who owns which nobles, or what you need to build a noble, and the portraits are frickin' ugly.
Theme: More European medievalism. At least the executions/assassinations and so on are coherent thematically.

This is my type of game. Area control with a difference, selective card drawing from 2 different decks, multiple scoring mechanisms allowing for different winning strategies. The rules are clear and concise. It moves along at a good pace with plenty of short and long term decisions to make. The treachery cards (guillotine, axe man, gallows, Spanish Inquisition and assassin) bring a lot of fun, theme and intrique to the game. Whilst gaining power in countries is the main goal, the race for one of each noble type and then the most of each noble type at the end of the game provides all players with strategic dilemmas. I own it and strongly recommend it for those liking this genre of games.

I play-tested this a few times for Peter, so I know what I'm talking about but I may be biased. I'm not a huge fan of area majority games, but in this one it's not so much a matter of throwing cubes at a region - you have to have a plan to gain influence. Once you've formulated the plan you need to gather the cards and create the noble, while all the time watching what the other players might be up to - you don't want your king assassinated the moment he takes the throne. As well as the struggle for control of regions there are other ways to gain points, and you'd like a plan that pays off in two or three ways. I find that the game moves at just the right pace for you to have time to think about what you need to do, but small tensions are resolved quickly and big tensions stretch out through the game.

Now that I've finally seen the proper version of the game I feel qualified to give the game a rating. The art work is by Czarne, the guy who did Fragile and a few other completely gorgeous games. It's generally functional, though I do think France fades into the ocean on the map a little bit. And I'm definitely biased about this - I'm not a huge fan of the Troops card... it was based on a picture of me and makes me look almost as fat as I really am. 

I'm not a huge fan of area control games - I think I rate El Grande and Louis XIV about a 3 each, but Heads of State is much more like Thurn and Taxis with an area control element added on. The area of control element reminds me of something like Kreta or Midgard where you have to go to devote some thought to gaining influence in a region.

Many levels of play to this game - far more so than immediately obvious.

The card selection aspect forces you to re-evaluate your original plans on a regular basis, if they become unachievable in the time available, and with 4 or 5 players it becomes somewhat cut-throat given the limited availability of some resources.

First play Jan 2009 CanCon - Quite a fun and enjoyable game.  First phase is mostly spent building nobels.  Game kicks into high gear in phases 2 & 3 when the treachery cards come into big play as you jostle and elbow for position. There is something gleefully satisfying when you Assassinate the King of England or send a French Prince to the Guillotine.  And nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! Initial impression 7.5/10.

I think the game play is an 8.  The terrible decisions on coloring for the tiles bring it down for me.  I developed a headache staring at the board trying to decipher what pieces were what, and who owned them.  The art is nice, but it really scores low on functionality.  It's enough of a problem for me that I'm not sure I want to own it.

Not hard to teach but hard to get it at the begining. Many interaction and fighting, Like it and probably would come to the table more than I have expected.
Few options from turn to turn but you have to take look to so many cards and analize what you want and can do. The scoring could be a bit confusing for some players

Rating after 1 play.

Played at AGE 2009 with the designer. Nice area majority tile laying game with many different opportunities for scoring, all of which need to be kept in mind all the time.

Very nice tricky shifts in control possible through assassinations.

Found that the noble tiles, although attractive, made it difficult to easily see my board position.

Bizarre stupidity in the review threads for this game; chalk one for kindische Selbstdarsteller

Interesting set collection game with numerous opportunities to score. Game evolves into a more cut throat experience as the different countries fill up with nobles.  The artwork freaks everyone out.  Wish they had spent more money here.

There isn't a lot of chrome to get in the way of the game, but the game itself is quite good. Area control with a flavor that changes from a peaceful seeming first round, a more conflicted second and a bloody third. 

A variety of scoring opportunities makes for some challenging decisions.

One 2-player game didn't yet reveal this games potential in one way or the other, so this rating is very inital one. Next time I won't bother adding the points from the wooden blocks during the game, I'll just add them in the game end. That should drop the playing time and make it more certain the players remember to take the cards from nobles. Interested in trying with more players.

As so many others have mentioned before me: The production values are nice and the graphics are creepy.

RATING: 5
A combination of set collecting, area majority, and "do this first" scoring.  The game lasts way too long for what is offered.  The first 45 minutes is boring solitaire-like play, the second 45 minutes is a lot of fun, and the third forty five minutes is excruciatingly bad as you wait for the game to end.  

The game has some of the worst physical production of any game I've ever seen.  There are pieces with no purpose (the round disc on the revolution deck) and entire mechanics that were unecessary and could have been replaced with something less fiddly (the cubes and bag).  All the stickers and wooden discs seem odd when cardboard would have done.  PLUS you can't tell which pieces are which with just a glance, as the colors used are confusing.  Three shades of gray, multiple browns, etc.  

Overall, its ticket to ride: advanced with a couple other mechanics tacked on and the soul removed.  Not my favorite game.  A few cool mechanics and neat ideas ruined by poor development and crap physical components.

Played once so far.  Set collection meets area control with a three-layed point scoring system.  The mechanics are really neat, and the game morphs from a "land grab" early on to a ruthless battle for controlling areas.  The criticisms about colour confusion are perfectly justified, and the reputation of this game has been undermined by this unfortunate fact.  If it stays in my collection then its rating will likely improve.  The only reason that it might not stay in my collection is because I feel I have too many area control games!

Replaced in my collection with the brilliant reimplementation "Royals" which fixes all criticisms!

The bad: It's a bit long with 5 players with very little to do in the down time (either play with less people or pick up cards at the end of a turn?).  I'm not a huge fan of the way the assassin works (could they be removed or made 100% lethal?).  Also I find the piles of cards a bit fiddly & I wish more time had been taken with the art.

The good: I like the theme & the multiple ways to score.  I love the way that chasing one goal can detract from another.  

I really want to test out some variants to make it more suited to my own tastes.

Also, it reminds me of Blue Moon City in some ways with the constant supply of cards so that you can nearly always do something ... but you have to decide what the BEST thing is to do & whether it's worth waiting to build your supply even more.

Designer's comments: if you don't want a random element, simply play "two assassins kills outright in the provinces and 3 assassins kills outright in the capitals"

In future I will probably only play with 3 players (& have been enjoying quite a few games this way.)

RATING: 8
I don't think we understood the full range of possibilities available to us given the execution cards.  Things tended to be pretty static, and with a flurry of killing toward the end of the last couple of rounds.  This felt odd to me, but I think I could like the game more with repeated play.

RATING: 5
Like its theme this game is the product of too much inbreeding (Ticket to Ride and El Grande). There's nothing much wrong with it in isolation apart from a tendency to drag in Year 3 when you have to assassinate to place a noble, so allow 2.5 hours at the table. There's also the issue of how often you're picked on to be the target of such assassination. These mechanisms have been implemented so much better elsewhere, this is very much second tier material.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Like Thurn and Taxis, but with more murder.  There's a certain amount of area-controlly competition which I enjoyed, but it wasn't enough to hold the game together.  The luck of the draw dominated and in the last turn, it's impossible to play a card if you don't first assassinate someone.  This becomes a little tedious, above and beyond the game being long for what it is.  Meh. Also, the art is very ugly and it's hard to tell which noble is which. (1 play)

This game has one standout feature that separates it from a more uninteresting area control games.

This game just doesn't work - the actual component design was executed poorly, hard to distinguish nobles, spaces on the board, cards in hand (should be an indicator in each corner of the card).. Game seemed to just drag on, constantly referring to the card needs chart, the board spaces, the point values, the other point values and yet the other point values.. Some games take 3 hours and you think 'where did the time go' - this game lasted a truncated 2.5 hours, and yet it seemed like 6 hours. - And it was going to slow down even more, as we were just drafting treachery cards. Two of us were so far behind going into the third turn that (combined) we were still losing by a comfortable margin, with only the 4th player having a chance to make up the difference.. Runaway leader would seem to be a problem... Also, the card drafting process becomes quite random and you really can't plan on getting needed cards, I never saw a palace on my turn to draft until the last few turns of the game and you need that card for a King, there didn't seem to be any way to mitigate this shortfall.. Just an interminable game and not much fun.

Played with the author at a convention - lovely guy.  Card drafting (a la Thurn and Taxis) and area control with multiple scoring options are two of my least favourite mechanisms and they are the foundation of this game.

I do not normally comment on price but it seems incredibly high.

The game has some huge strikes against it before even considering how the game plays.  I feel bad saying this, especially since the faces belong to people associated with the game, but the cover art has to be among the worst I've ever seen - awful.  The rest of the graphic design inside is just as bad, with awfully cheesy fonts, the same horribly photoshopped faces, and confusing colors.

The game itself feels derivative, and less aggressive than I had anticipated.  I think that if you could play the game in under an hour, it would be much more fun.  But at 90 minutes it's simply too long for what it is, which is a simple, card-based area majority game.  The conflict resolution system can be very frustrating, as there were so many upsets during assassinations, even when the odds are 3:1.

One of the most uninspired games to be released in the last years, offering very little news in terms  of mechanisms and not a stir of life in theme or game play. Yes, this game sux big time. Just collecting cards in the right combinations to put a 'noble' on the map and then scoring for: having 'nobles' in all different countries, having a majority in one country, being number two in one country, being the first to have all different nobles on the table... 
This makes a mockery of game design and all it stands for. It displays all the negative traits that give eurogames a bad name. We decided to halt the game halfway so as not to waste more time on it. Thank god I was able to dissuade an unsuspecting prospective buyer.

It's hard not to characterize portions of [gameid=38778] as "Ticket to Ride: Heads Will Roll".  The card mechanics are quite similar.  You're utilizing sets to "build" nobles as opposed to train routes.  Rather than completing tickets though, it's all about keeping your nobles installed across several European countries.  That area control aspect of the game is what sets it apart and makes for a nice alternative to "TTR".

The final artwork for the game ended up being rather bland, which is unusual for Czarne.  If given some reworked art and a second run, I think "Heads" would find the audience it deserves.

OK set collection and area majority game. Nothing really original, but solid integration of known mechanisms. Luck of the draw can be rather annoying when everybody is looking for the same cards. Nice touch: the heads of the nobles are based on the portraits of the designer and playtesters. By the way, the designer didn't make it to King, although apparently he didn't have much say in the actual selection ... **** Game was explained by designer Peter Hawes in Essen 2008.

Yikes, the terrible graphical design adds an extra challenge to Heads of State as players struggle to decipher what exactly is going on on the board. Unfortunately that extra challenge might actually be the best part of the game. 

Heads of State is an extremely dull and long winded hand management game, which after the first game year or so requires players to spend several uninteresting turns of card gathering to achieve something that may or may not have miniscule effect on scoring. Biggest turn angst in five player game is "do I stay awake until its my turn again?".

This HAS some potential, but it loose it thanks to horrible component (and board) design: it's very hard to see the overall situation. There is a clever idea how to get your guys on the board (but it needs some tweaking as you'll see). And for me the biggest issue is, that the game takes too long compared to what it is (Web of Power / Kardinal & König only 20min vs. HoS 90 minutes).

Played once, 5p.  Better than I expected, for sure.  This is a game of recruiting nobles, and keeping the alive as long as possible - or, abandoning those that aren't pulling their weight and installing new ones elsewhere.  This is a very aggressive game - you must attack your opponents nobles to get ahead.  Not really my kind of game, but it's worth a look if you're in to fairly simply direct conflict.

RATING: 5
I'm not certain where I stand on this game.  I enjoyed the game and the card drafting/set collection aspect involved in developing area majorities in either country or nobility.  The assassination aspect is brutal - this is not a game for people who dislike aggression and conflict in a game.  Neither do you want to play this game with people who randomly assassinate nobles with no purpose as that will destroy and strategy in the game.  As well, this game feels like it takes a long time.  The other issues I find with this game is that I'd just prefer to play El Grande instead of this...which takes probably even less time!

A Sort of Ticket to Ride meets the French Revolution. Part of the problem for me with this game is the sheer physical size of the thing. You`ll need a big playing space, when really the board could have been nothing more than a series of boxes and cut down to more than half the size. Then there is the issue of the Noble`s card deck which really needed to have been numbered for ease of play.  The nobles do appear on the player mats ( once again a bit too large ) but I found a lot of downtime due to players` looking up what makes an Earl, Count,
Prince, Etc, when having numbered cards for the varied Nobles would have made this a far easier/smoother process.
I agree that really you need not have had all the wooden scoring cubes as the scoring track appears on the board
( another issue that could have been resolved at the board design stage. Finally, the Noble tiles were hard on the eyes in order of colour recognition and really should have had black borders to help the players. I did my own assassination dice for the game which was four sides red ( a kill ) and two sides green ( a miss ). Indeed a dice could have been used for all attempts at Noble kills.
Having said all this, a better game is waiting to come out here, and I feel that Z.Man games could and should have resolved the issues spoken about here way before going to the printers. As is, it kinda looks like it was rushed to market.

Finally got to play this one as well!! Not what I expected, so had to adjust my expectations......drafting (ala Ticket to Ride/Thurn and Taxis)and postioning game that has pretty big downtime between turns which detracts from the gameplay. Was expecting more of a history/strategy game. Perhaps a little abstract for my taste. The artwork left quite alot to be desired too. There was a prototype from the same designer that I actually liked quite alot better than this one!!

I really enjoyed my one play of this, but the end-game scoring seemed a bit too unbalanced. Huge amounts of points were awarded and the winner seemed like it was determined more by this than by everyone's play during the earlier parts of the game. The physical presentation leaves something to be desired, too (the pictures on the pieces are hard to tell apart when they're on the board). I'd certainly like to play again and see if the end-game swings are common or if they can be mitigated with clever play.

RATING: 6
Maybe not my kind, but sure is a nice game. The basic mechanics are good, but I think the killer acts seams to be hard and intimidating. The next time I'll try to get someone killed early in the game. I like the assassin "roll" with the cubes in the bag. It's the same of a dice roll, but "the feel" is more like you really doing something and is less "cold". It's a nice touch, maybe some others mechanics in game using the bag and cubes will be fine. To work in only one situation seams to be silly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Excruciating, and horribly, horribly long. 

Getting enough cards to build anything useful takes several rounds, and there's a huge deal of luck-of-the-draw. And after the hegaxonal VPs are gone, there's rarely anything meaningful to do since your dudes will get killed before the end of the century anyway. The fun part is nowhere to be found, and the general unusability certainly does not help at all.

Absolutely the worst looking game I've ever seen. It's not just bad, it's literally repulsive. The unusability level of graphic design, color choices, and components is unbelievable: It is extremely hard to figure out the situation on the board, let alone distinguish the nobles from one another. The Assassin is resolved by D4, but instead of a quick roll of a die you have to put cubes in a bag and draw.

It's a clean system, but it's too long for what it essentially a card drafting / position claiming game a la Ticket To Ride (but adding in the power to kill a claim). The second issue is that you get locked into a strategy and you're committed. If too many others lock into your strategy (be it country, or noble, or whatever) and leave others uncompeted for, then you're in trouble. You can't afford to abandon initial investments as they build on each other. The components make it difficult to assess game state and player positions on the board, unnecessarily lengthening turns. All combined, it works, but it doesn't provide a lot of interest to explore further.

The gameplay is rather straightfoward once you get through the rules. Various mechanisms: hand management, creating nobles via set collection, various ways of scoring via noble majorities, area control, and a healthy dose of nastiness. The dry theme, unremarkable artwork, the  combo of mechanisms, and potentially long game time will put off some gamers.

If players know the rules and enjoy the game, I believe the game can be played in under 90 minutes.

This game is a conundrum. The board and components are excellent quality and the rules are well written. But it just isn't a deep enough game to demand a £50+ price tag.

HOWEVER, I paid £16.89 including shipping for a new copy and that was definitely a bargain.

It's a fun game, lasts 90-120 minutes and is a combination of set-making and worker placement. The scoring system is quite good. I think with 4 or 5 experienced players you could get a bit more depth out of it, but not from occasional playings.

At full price I would rate it a 5, but at the price I paid it's a solid 7 as it is more than the filler game level it was priced at.

This area control game was fairly dry and too long for what it was.  I'm not sure the turn order is properly balanced, going first seems a lot better than going last, despite starting with less cards.  The end of the game was a little frustrating, because you must draw an execution card if you want to do anything, and that takes up 2/3rds of your turn.  The game wasn't horrible, but there are better games out there.

Wow, I wanted to like it. It has nice components. Otherwise, there is just so many better area control games out there. Plus, the cards distribution is not even. So, if you really need a science card for your king but the others are hoarding them you're screwed (there are only 9). Why are you screwed? Because the luck of the draw says you don't deserve a science card. How are you screwed? Well you won't get your 16 points for getting your set of 7 guys first. You will be lucky if you're third. What if you're 5th player? Forget about it. The first round card bonus is a joke and doesn't even come close in compensating you. So what if you can't be one of the first to build your king. Well now you have to take assassin cards because all the king spots are taken (happened in our game). So you're wasting turns because it takes several country specific cards to kill a king. Boring and annoying! Not a good combination. 

ONE of the only games I can remember where all five guys mutually decided to call it quits before round 2 was over so we could move on to something we would enjoy playing.

Played prototype last April with the designer. Nice set collection combined with area control. A bit long for some (due to being new to the game). Artist made the production version look much worse than the prototype (both asthetically and functionally - those noble counters get lost on the map so it's very hard to see who controls what). The map does not project the period which is a shame as I quite like the game. Lots of 'if I only did this or that' discussion post game which is always a sign of a good design.

Like how the various nations are worth alternate amounts. with some being close between 1st and 2nd and others like France having a large difference. 
Like how the area control element is controlled type of noble with different positions having different strengths.

The treachery attack element is interesting, requiring the build cards and a 3 in 4 chance of replacing a noble. However, it doesn't kick in until late in 2nd round. The bonus for taking the initial position are too strong to wast time fighting for position, until they are all taken

Has an interesting combination of set collecting to drive your area control, do have to plan ahead. 

Visually a nightmare, very difficult the distinguish the different nobles and factions. Too many subtle overlaps. 

It is one of those games that has a nice set of features - but just doesn't blend together well.

There are aspects of this that I don't mind, but the general design of this game, both graphic and play, is so  disjointed I couldn't have cared less who won, as long as it meant the game was over.  

This is now my go to game as a figure head for why graphic Design is essential.   Not even the cards were readable...
Whoever gave this the green light for production receives an F- for the aesthetics.  

This game goes on a very short list I have;  Games I couldn't bear to finish, and didn't

One play.  I suspect this rating will go up with repeat plays.  My first play was marred by the fact that I was ALWAYS the person assassinated (I had six people killed before anyone else had more than two), and it hurt my position badly, through no fault of my own.  The rest of the game I really enjoyed - an interesting mix of set collection and area control.

An area control game with a really solid core but a lot of crufty components added in. Could've easily been a small box card-centric game at half the price.

It's a two hour card drafting area majority game with a fixed path of play, a hit the leader grind near the end and colours/heads that all blur into one. It's not a terrible effort - the game is okay, but up against the competition on my shelf I have better ways of spending my gaming time. I'd play it again, but I wouldn't rush to do so. Why? The decisions aren't very interesting once you've decided which regions you'll be concentrating on. The game pushes you into concentrating on regions due to the scoring mechanic which rewards concentrating on areas, so that is what you'll do. Unfortunately the essential problem with this design in a multiplayer game is that it often leads to the player who avoids confrontation the most winning the game. Then you've got a tight finish lined up where a small indirect action by one player can result in a big swing in the noble points at the end of the game. You're going to have to be careful not to be a kingmaker if you're out of the running. It all just seems a bit random for a two hour game, and not random in an El Grande good way. For a two hour investment of my time it feels like a waste of good gaming time. I would probably feel differently about the whole shebang if the game came in at an hour - for an hour of my time I can overlook randomness plodding along. But it's not an hour game - it's a two hour game. A two hour game needs to be a little bit special to attract my attention. Finally, I'll never get over the use of white wig heads and subtle background colours completely destroying any chance of getting an overview of the game situation at a glance - not since Magna Grecia has my head spun so much.

An attempt to create a unique majority control game that fails terribly. The biggest problem is the component design which fails at multiple points, making the game difficult to play, but beyond that it's a bit of a Frankenstein with different mechanics cobbled together without much cohesion.

Take Ticket to Ride and change it enough so that instead of the contract rummy aspect giving you tracks, you get to put nobles down instead.  Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

In addition to being a dull drafting/set collection game, ala Phase 10 with a board, the art is so invasive that you can't even tell if your pieces (or other player's pieces) are on the board.  

The Courtesan is stupidly overpowered.  The cube draw is just silly (why did we each need cubes? why not just 3 whites and a black, or a 4 sided die). 

The only good thing about this game is that you can refer to it as Ticket to Head.

One of the worst new games I have played in recent memory.  It drags on forever with uninspired gameplay.  The conflict resolution is ridiculous and you cannot build any defense.  Instead, you get to place a single cube in a bag.  The board is difficult to read to the point where I wasn't sure which spaces contained markers.  Furthermore, distinguishing which markers are which is a chore.  The decisions are routine.  Just a mess.  Oh yeah, I won the game.  The most unsatisfying victory I can imagine!

I really don't understand why so many people don't like this game! I've found it to be clever and straighforward. Maybe with some awkward rules (the fighting system) or the majority points in a 2 player game but in the end it's a good game, it seems.

I still have to play it with more players and see if it lasts a bit too much time. Still one of the best games I've played from this years Essen.

Now I understand why so many don't like the game - it simply doesn't work. At some point, in my first play I admit that the game worked perfectly fine dispite some minor flaws but after I've played it again I know now that the game doesn't work well, it's dull and it takes forever.

Played at BGG.CON 2008.  This is a pretty good game.  It's essentially two games in one.  The first third of the game is the designer's take on set collection and area control.  Once the board is full of nobles, the second part of the game kicks in - treachery.  The timing required for removal of nobles (replaced by yours, of course) is critical.  Overall, this is a fun game.

Neither as wonderful nor as dreadful as some have claimed.  Get your nobles onto limited board spaces by collecting sets of cards. Sometimes quite hard due to hand limits. Points awarded for everything under the sun. I wish there was more reason/incentive to pickup treachery cards earlier in the game for use later. Artwork/player colours could have been clearer.

I like the area control and the treachery aspect of this game. Just played a two players games which was very challenging. The mechanism of this game is just great and every game you play is different. You have to adapt your strategy each time ... depends on many criteria. Do love that game and i have played it already many times.The more you play the better you see the strategies.We have to stay concentrated till the end of the game; HOS is far one of my favorite game and I advice everybody to play more than once.

My biggest disappointment in Essen 2008; the theme sounded very interesting, yet all the game had to offer was a mechanism to collect cards and play sets of them. Not very original. Did not like the artwork, either.
I feel there should have been more to bring the theme to live than just collecting cards.

I don't feel that this game lives up to the reputation that Z-Man Games carries with titles such as Troyes, Agricola and Ora et Labora. Like many of the lesser titles by Z-Man, this one has decent mechanics but poor art quality. Unfortunately, I am of the camp that believes that visuals are a key element of game play. The mechanics are good but not great, so they do not compensate for this. In this case, the art actually detracts from gameplay as the design on the pieces and on the board creates confusion in determining which pieces belong to which player and makes the scoring painful. I also found the late game to be filled with an unbearable amount of downtime as players tried to think through each and every option (something that cannot be done in advance because of card drafting mechanics). Overall my feeling of this game is meh. I'll play with people who want to try something different, but I'll recommend something better if most have already played this one.

The way the game plays with two almost entirely separate phases ( A: Fill Board; B: start assassinating) seems problematic to me. Until the board is full, there is almost no incentive to pick up Treachery cards; once it is full, Treachery is the order of the day.

This game just wasn't exciting for my group.  It went over so poorly, all 5 players decided to end the game before the end of the second year.

I enjoy randomness and luck in my games, but the card set collection mechanic just doesn't work.  I had built up 6 of the 7 characters and only required a Science card to complete the king and because I was third in turn order, I never had the opportunity to finish my set for the king.  There's nothing you can do if 3 of the 6 cards showing are Science cards and there are 2 players ahead of you.  You will not get that Science card you need.  To top it off, the frustration of the game increased when I took my cards and the cards that replaced my chosen cards includes a Science card.  You are truly at the mercy of luck of the draw in this game.

I did not like the assasination mechanic because you must have a set of the specific character you want to assasinate before you can take that action.  How can I assasinate a king, if I can't get that last card I require to complete the king set?  The answer is simple - you can't.  There is no mechanic in place to assist you in this circumstance.  The wild card (Courtesan) can't be used to build the lowest character (Baron, I think) or the highest (the King).  This makes sense with the Baron since all that is required is 1 gold card to build him.  It makes no sense at all with the king.  Yes, the king would be much easier to build, but I feel to balance this all that would be required is to lower the number of Courtesans in the game. 

I could overlook the flaws of the game if it was fun, but the game just isn't that enjoyable.

I am afraid that this game really does not have any redeeming features for me. The gameplay is very unexciting, with very little to do in a single turn but still quite some downtime near the end of the game. The game is also far too luck heavy for its length: If unlucky with the card draw, a player might find that he can do nothing on the board for as many as three turns. And the game end depends on the draw of cards as well! Also, it is a pity that the game is bereft of any need for strategy: It is more like a tactical risk taking game that gets repetitious after 60 minutes of play. Finally, this is one of the worst looking games I ever played. The artwork and layout of cards and counters are especially gruesome.

One play, 1st year only, Spiel 08.  I liked the gameplay, but less so the production.  The board and cards are good-looking but far too large, and the players' noble tokens not differentiated enough.  Perhaps the full game would run too long, perhaps the treachery would get frustrating (there seemed little point in assassination during the first year, so we did little of it) - I'd like to find out.

I shouldn't like this game.  It has all kinds of stuff that usually turns me off to games.  The theme is thin, the goal is the very bland competing for victory points, the main mechanics (set-collecting and area majority), are overused, and the art is so bad that our game group has nicknamed this 'Heads of Photoshop.'  But somehow, it comes together in a cohesive whole that I really enjoy.  

This is a tense game of multilayered scoring systems that feel like one of Martin Wallace's historically themed titles like [gameid=2507] or [gameid=21954].  Specifically, the scoring system is both granular and balanced in a way which feels very Wallace-esque, and it is supported by a simple mechanic (set-collecting in this case) that allows a lot of freedom without being overwhelming.   Trying to place your nobles for best effect is an interesting process full of juicy choice.  Then, right when things are starting to get boring, the spaces on the board fill up, and treachery cards start getting played left and right, and now you have to worry about your nobles getting ganked.  Ulp.  

One other caveat besides the art: the theme, while appealing to yours truly, is not particularly strong.  This is usually a problem for me, but this game is good enough to get me to ignore it.  So, it's worth looking past the obvious flaws to play this game, because you just might be surprised.

Played at Great Hall Games with Vincent and Alex, and again with Matt/Vincent/Mark. This is a game of area control and card collection, with an assassination angle. 

I like that it has a lot of strategy and several different paths to victory. However, the amount of options and information on the board may cause other players to go into analysis/paralysis. Players must set an expectation of how fast the game will go.

After playing it a 2nd time, I still don't have a feel for the game. It needs to be played a few more times to "get it."

Perfect semi-Euro game with great backstabbing elements.  Not your vanilla coated play nice Euro game.  Under-rated in my opinion but carries a high price tag with crappy components.  The tokens are almost as thin as the cards and you have to spend a half hour attaching stickers to wooden tokens.  Oh, and don't even get me started on the cheesy photoshop cover graphics.  YuK. Despite the quality, the game play is fun and engaging.

Pretty much a stinker.  

First off, the graphic design/ergonomics of the game are bad.  Everything is hard to read and nothing is intuitive.  

Second, the game is too long for what it is.  At its heart, it is a set collection game.  You have some decisions, but not that many.  So, if it played in 60 minutes, perfect.  But, it doesn't - it's more like 2+ hrs.

Collect cards to build/buy nobles. There are 9 or so different nobles from the lowly Baron to the King. Once bought you place the noble on one of the countries (Europe) of the board. Each country has a place for a specific number of nobles. There are several ways to score victory points including area majority so you have to balance which cards you need to get the future nobles to score point. It is a pretty good game.

A game that is okay and would probably be a six for me if the graphics were fixed. I am unable to differentiate the leaders on the board or even my counters and spent way too much time squinting at the board and not playing. If there was a great game underneath I could deal with that but there is not. The mechanics all work reasonably well even if they are not completely integrated. The amount of randomness felt a bit high for the amount of effort I was putting in to calculating best position. I would play again but it would certainly not be my first choice.

Game is better than its detractors would lead you to believe.  Nice combination of set collecting, area control, and intrigue.  Its too bad the counters were not designed better so it would be easier to figure out the current status of control faster.

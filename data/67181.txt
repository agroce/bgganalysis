I really like the game because even people with no drawing skills can win and it there are some very difficult words in it to "draw". But the problem is, that you can not play the game each week with the same cards, because than you remember the words which is unfair for other players. They should bring more cards into the game, because no beginnr wants to start with the difficult pack.

I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Yet another simple party game that falls flat for me. I find PIX kinda boring, but party games in general are definitively not something I enjoy.

PIX tries to bring out those Pictionary-like situations, where you were supposed to draw something and you did it so bad, that nobody can figure out what that drawing is supposed to mean. That's how PIX tries to be fun, which is fine if you're someone that thought that part of Pictionary was fun and wishes more of those moments. In this case great, this is a game for you as it's packed with that kind of situations. Unfortunately I'm not someone like that. Plus I'm really bad at any game that involves drawing in any shape or form.

Even if party games aren't really my thing, there's a lot of them that I enjoy way more than this one. Not for me.

This is a very clever idea for a game where you are only able to complete a drawing by using a few black pixels.  It's similar to the issue of creating tiny icons in older days of computing.  In this game, you are also provided a red pixel and a red greater than sign to spice it up a bit.  The idea is really neat and we were entertained for a bit.  However, we found it was too hard to actually get people to guess the picture.  More artistic ability is probably required than what we were able to provide.

A Pictionary-type game, with the twist that players can only "draw" using chunky pixels.

Teams of players get a word to "draw", and simultaneously, but individually, work to depict the word.  Then, the player who used the least pixels reveals his drawing, and the other team tries to guess.  If someone guesses, both the guesser and the drawer get a point.  If not, the player who used the next most pixels reveals, and so on.

So, the less pixels you use, the earlier you get to show, but you risk being too vague.  The more pixels you use, the later you reveal, so you risk the word already getting guessed before it gets to you. But, if it makes it to you, perhaps there is an element to an earlier reveal that makes it easier for yours to be guessed.

Overall, a fun game, but I think the gimmick might wear out pretty quickly for me.

We played with different rules pretty quickly - maybe to avoid teams, and having one team get an 'easier' word than another.  Everyone made a picture for their respective words, and then everybody else just guessed by writing the answers. Points were awarded for correct answers to creator and guesser.  Over a few rounds, more and less difficult subjects evened out.

굉장히 만족스러운 파티 게임!

9인까지 할 수 있다는 것이 매력적이고, 특히 게임인원이 홀수일 경우 팀이 계속 변한다는 것이 흥미롭습니다.
단어들이 영어이지만 쉬운 수준이고, 스마트폰으로 금방 검색할 수 있기 때문에 그다지 불편하지 않습니다.

제한된 픽셀로 표현하는 것이 생각보다 쉽지는 않습니다.
하지만 팀끼리 비슷한 생각을 가지고 표현해도, 서로 차이점이 발생하는 것을 보는 것도 재미있고, 가끔 완전히 새로운 방식으로 표현하는 것을 보면 놀랄 때도 있습니다.

그림그리기류 게임보다 부담이 덜 하면서도 모두가 즐겁게 웃을 수 있는 게임이며, 상당한 인원을 커버하는 이 게임을 추천합니다.

단, 휴대하기에 무게는 좀 나가는 편이라는 점 기억해 주세요~

RATING: 4.5
So, this is a pefectly fine game, ruined in its English edition by a completely half-assed translation effort on the word cards. 

They seem to be direct, non-idiomatic translations of perfectly reasonable French words, which results in a lot of perfectly unreasonable English words. There was seemingly no effort at curation, or any assessment of reasonability or playability. 

Unless you can curate the cards yourself (which will ruin the game, since the curator will know the cards), or find another source of reasonable English words and clues, I have to suggest avoiding this.

The entertainment value is 70% in laughing at the helpless looks on people's faces as they try to guess the intention behind your own terrible pixel art. The other 30% is the feeling of satisfaction when somebody makes a correct guess from way too little information (because you always have way too little information).

Better than it has any right to be, which is to say, it's a pretty good time with the right people, rather than a pointless novelty disaster.

A different little gimmick for a party game, Pix sees players using square magnets to construct a picture rather than drawing one. The "Name That Tune" aspect of using as few pixels as possible compared to your opponent is a fun little choice as well. Ultimately though, this feel pretty flat with everyone in the large group we played with. The way the teams work is unnecessarily convoluted and varies wildly with the addition or subtraction of a single player. And the gimmick alone isn't enough to recommend it over any number of other "get my team to guess" style games.

RATING: 7
A very nice Pictionary variant. Here, you have to make your drawing using black magnetic squares on a white grid. The challenge is increased because your pictures are so much more abstract than they would be if you could draw them. Nice presentation with magnetic boards to hold the pieces in place. Some of the words are kind of bull crap (pylon? canadair!?) but that's preferable to having it be too easy. Fun stuff.

A simple and easy drawing party game. Pix is especially recommended for someone who is not good at drawing. Every participents has to drawing with black and red dots and arrow. The drawing skill is not really important here. I've enjoyed once, but I still like other drawing games more, such as Telestration and Pictionary. Even though I am a bad painter, I still enjoy Telestration or Pictionary more. The fascination of drawing game is ambiguousness and abstractness of pictures.

I suppose many will love this game, considered a party game with a high player limit, but anything this game does seems to be done better in Pictomania. There's too much guessing in this game, randomly naming anything trying to be lucky, and once the clue is given, most of the time, people will guess correctly regardless of pix drawing.

An excellent party game! This could be just another type of Pictionary or Clay molding type game, but it's not. First of all, you are creating pictures with pixels. The pixels are square magnets and the player boards are magnetic gridded boards. Each player has a number of black squares, one red square and one arrow with which to use. 

The cleverness and what really makes this game work is the use of teams and how you score points. First one player will show his picture. If his picture isn't recognized, then his teammate shows the same picture created from his perspective. The correct guesser will get a score cube and the teammate who last revealed the picture will get a score cube. If no one guesses, then a clue is given and if someone finally guesses it they get a cube, but the picture creators get nothing. Another nice feature of the game is the fact that teams will rotate every 2 rounds and if you have odd or even numbers of players the game still works perfectly.

A very nice and well play tested game.

What a pleasant surprise this game was, you form random teams (which do not play together) and take a clue card. Each team will use their pix board and squares to draw. The really cool part is that you are drawing in 8-bit with fixed black scares, one red scare and an arrow. This makes it very hard to create details. Once one player is finished, the others have 30 seconds to complete their drawing. Now for each team, the one who used the least amount of squares to draw shows their picture to the other team(s), if guessed the drawer and guesser get a point, otherwise the next member on the team can show their picture. So using less pixels gets you to show your picture first, but in less detail, versus going second and using more squares. It creates very funny drawings, even the easiest thing can be hard to draw this way. Very fun game.

A neat party game that uses the classic formula of draw-to-guess but limits your creativity by forcing you to use pixels on a magnetic board instead of pens or clay etc. While this may sound as same-old same-old, it actually works quite well because coming up with pixelated representations of thinks like "Wolf" ain't as easy as it sounds. The idea of rewarding the players that use less pixels than others is also quite clever. Good laugh !

The basic concept of using low-resolution pixel art to give clues is fun.

But it suffers from the problems of all such "Password" style games:

1. You need to guess the exact word. This can sometimes get annoying (e.g. distinction between singular and plural or other variations). It also raises practical problems if not all players are equally fluent in the language of the printed cards. (E.g. me playing with a set of cards translated to Polish.)

2. Someone who knows the clue cards (e.g. the game's owner) will have an obvious advantage in guessing.

The original edition's box is an inconvenient cube shape. Apparently later editions come in a more standard portable flat box.

For me, it's an OK filler to play at a game conventions, but nothing I'd actively seek out.

This is a party game with some similarities to Pictionary and ROFL.  The players are all separated into "teams" (who are actually competing directly with one another) and each team receives a card with a word on it.  Players then create pixelated pictures using a white grid and black squares (there is also a red square and a red arrow) of the object.  The similarity to ROFL is that on each team the player who used the fewest black squares (the red one counts as 4 and the arrow counts as 2) gets to reveal their picture first.  If it is guessed the artist and the guesser each get a point.

This is a neat concept, I especially like the twist on Pictionary making square, pixelated pictures.  I think the ruleset is a bit wonky and presents some problems though.  I don't mind the ROFL rules for which player gets to reveal first, I like ROFL and think that rule works well here as well.  However, here are the things I don't like.  First of all, when each pair of players get a different clue in the same round the discrepancy between the clue difficulty becomes a real problem.  One round my team's clue was "springboard" while another team had "man".  Well, I guess I'm not getting points this round and one person on that team certainly is.

This also introduces a problem with the RoboRally or Galaxy Trucker-style timer rules.  When one person is done creating their picture they set a 30-second timer for the other players to finish.  I will admit this is a minor quibble since most games like this have a timer anyway but 30 seconds isn't a lot of time for some of the clues.  We had rounds where players needed to simply place one piece and flip the timer and I'm left with 30 seconds to create a pixelated springboard!  I feel the timer was set at 30 seconds because until a player flips the timer there is, in essence, unlimited time to create your picture.  The game would be better served with a one-minute timer for each round with no player interference.

Finally, the guessing rules are just plain dumb, they are.  In Pictionary the guessing is all done by a team and the whole team gets the points for a correct guess.  In ROFL the guesser gets one guess per clue-giver.  In this game when a player reveals their picture it is a bedlam of people yelling out guesses.  Keep in mind this game is better, like many party games, with more participants yet with more players the chaos just increases.  When you reveal your picture some people around the table might not see from as clear an angle as others, people can be misheard or not heard shouting a correct guess over others, and I have a real problem with games that rely on reflexes because I don't have the best reflexes.  And yes, this can include peoples ability to shout out answers faster than others.  There were a few rounds where I or other players clearly figured out a picture as quickly as another but shouted out the answer just a milisecond later.

All in all these things combined made it a very poor party game in my opinion.

Easily now, one of the best 'party' games. It takes into account 'downtime' mechanism by having opposites display at the same time, and everyone builds at once.  Easily not a 'slow' party game, like a lot of them are.  And the nature of the game levels the playing field for people who get turned off by 'witty games' (like Dixit) or 'drawing games' like 'Pictionary'.  There's also a function in there to make people 'draw' the 'smallest' picture but still claim points.  I think this will be around for a while.  Fills the function of gateway, party, filler, etc.

You starts by thinking this is a great idea how come nobody thought about it before and then you play it and understand why.

Not without its problems, but Pix is good fun. Our group seem determined to use very few pixels, often using 6 or fewer, so the detailed examples shown on the box are impossible to recreate.

That said, it's a fun little party game that pretty much anyone can play.

A number of the cards have bad translation issues which is a problem, but there are a lot of cards to choose from at least.

Pix is a new drawing game, offering amazing and unique experience for larger player numbers. Its a party game, because at least four friends have to meet to play it. On the other hand, it can be played in up to nine people, each drawing his picture every round. But great fun starts in four players, because players are divided in teams at least with two players each. Every group has boards of one color and this one team draws same picture, but each player separately. And only one of these team members can acquire victory point for this drawing together with one correctly guessing member of another team. It is important to use as few pixels as possible, when drawing the picture. Number of pixels used decides, which team member shows his drawing first to others and if they guess it right, others will not have their chance to show theirs. This means, that people in one team compete. And these teams switch members with every new card drawn by rotating color boards around the table. This inner-competition brings unknown tension into the game, because you have two tasks – draw a picture in a way, that someone will recognize it, but still use fewer pixels, than others! This combination of requirements is tough, although you can use two special red objects. You will have many laughs, when trying to guess, whats on the pictures. Few pixels sometimes does not suffice and players have to have quite vast imagination. Every match has its length set with number of word cards and you will use around eight from an enormous 230 in total. Originally, the game was published only in French, but you can download rules and cards in english or german for free! Pix brings a whole new idea to a drawing board game and uses it with absolute perfection. So if you like drawing at least a little, then Pix should not be missing in your collection!

Pix is Pictionary, except you have to "draw" the pictures using square magnets you place in a grid, creating a pixelated image. You get points if you guess what someone else drew and/or if someone guessed your drawing. There are several players drawing the same picture, but whoever uses the fewest pixels gets to display their drawing first. So if you use a lot of pixels making your image unambiguous, your opponent will likely go first and take the point before your drawing is ever shown.

This is a party game where the real "fun" is laughing at people who can't draw. It's about par for the course for a party game. It was fun for a play, but having had the experience, there's not a real need to repeat it.

The concept is a little novel, but all things being equal, I think I'd rather play Pictionary, or Telestrations, or Eat Poop You Cat.  This just doesn't do it for me.

Simple, clever, fast, fun. Beside I won a t-shirt in a Pix contest so it can only be a good game.

An amazing party game for showcasing creativity. especially with some of the harder things to draw. Things like "freckles" "treehouse" "rear-view mirror". It's creative and hilarious. I had a blast playing this game in a medium sized group.

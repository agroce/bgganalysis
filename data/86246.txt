The theme is gorgeous, and the game has clearly been put together with love, by a new and exciting team of designers/publishers. I appreciate their ongoing support with mini-expansions. It is not the first game I will choose to play, and I would not play it too regularly because it doesn't offer up much variety, but once in a while, it's a real treat.

LIKE: Worker placement and engine building using the performers. Voting when to start the big show was interesting. I like the different powers on the performers. Unique theme.
DISLIKE: Lots of little rules and a bit fiddly. A little long. Some parts of the game (investment cards) seemed a little tacked on.

OVERALL: A fun, interesting game, but a bit long. Money was essential and some of the actions must be dedicated to getting money, which isn't as interesting as the other parts. I wish the performers had more variety in the powers to make the hiring decisions harder, as some times I didn't care what performers were available.

*Rating based on one play.

Pretty standard light worker placement game that doesn't do anything interesting and outstays its welcome.  There's not much interaction as the board does not get very crowded.  Lots of people have raved about the theme, but it doesn't really grab me and feels pretty pasted on.

Not a bad game, but not one I have any desire to play again.

Initial impressions: Very beautifull, colourfull game. Cool theme. Its a light-medium worker placement eurogame. Nothing innovative about the mechanics but I liked the voting part. The problem is that the game lacks tension. I like games where money is tight and this is not the case in Drum Roll. Also player interaction is pretty low even for a eurogame.

A very elegant eurogame. I like the mechanics.

The only thing I don't like is that you get to place only 2 cubes per round on your performers. And that cubes are too rare at the start, so you don't have much of a choice but to get them as soon as you can.

On all other aspects, it is a good, refreshing choice for 2-4 (indeed) people to play!

I can stay hours just watching the amazing artwork on the cards. Perfect work!

I definitely want to play it more, since each play seems different (after 6 plays).

Loved this one when we first played it. Revisiting it a year later we found the game to be a complete yawn-fest. None of the decisions are very interesting; quite often we found that 2 out of our 3 actions were simply to take more money, either because nothing else was appealing or made sense given what was out. We took more pleasure in putting this game away and putting it on the for trade list than actually playing it. No idea what we thought was so appealing about it when we first played it.

A játék nagyon szép, a téma szuper! Worker placement játék, összesen 3 akciónk van, és a választható akciók száma is viszonylag kevés, néha mégis nehéz dönteni. Embereket vehetünk fel, eszközöket kell nekik biztosítanunk, és a játék folyamán összesen 3-szor be kell mutatnunk velük egy show-t. A játék 3 szakasza végül is erre a show-ra való felkészülés. A legjobb embereinket le is szerződtethetjük (aminek egyik előnye, hogy onnantól kezdve olcsóbbak), 90%-ban ebből ered minden pontunk a játék során. Ami nagyon tetszett, az a szavazás, hogy folytatódjon-e még a felkészülés a show-ra (a 2. szavazásnál már büntet is a játék). Vicces elem a lakókocsi, bár túl nagy jelentősége nincs. Nagyon jó, hogy átjön a téma! Ami nem tetszett: szerintem elég egyértelmű, hogy mire kell menni: tisztán kockákra és alkalmazottakra, a segédeket az első játék alapján feleslegesnek éreztem. Játszani kellene még vele, hátha akkor rám cáfol a játék.

Comment while playtesting:
An excellent basic structure for a euro of the sweetspot complexity. 

For the final product:
Worthy economic euro with balanced development choices.

I could do with some more personnel (which I found in the mini expansions) and even more character(mechanics-wise) to the different performers. I think the game is sterilized for unbalance, which of course protects it from being broken but in the same time makes it less fun.
All in all a very good euro.

For the artwork:
excellent illustration skills.
I would like the informational icons to stand out more though. They blend in the colours of the illustration a bit too much.

Unusual theme and awesome artwork can attract by themselves, and Drum Roll is an excellet proof of that...
The game is nice, although it lacks any true innovation (not mentioning the card management, that's unusual but not a mechanic per se). After the bling fades away, what remains in classic Euro cupe pushing and management, with worker placement (not very tense, by the way: there's few options, and there's no true exlusivity - like in Agricola).
The game is not bad, but is not even great. It gets +0.5 rating because I like this type of game, anyway.

The game is a good worker placement/goods collection game. Fairly simple and straightforward. The theme was fun, and added to the appeal.

But the math of calculating income and expenses towards the end became burdensome. It almost required that we all stop the game in the last round and pulled out calculators. There choices also weren't overly interesting. A good game, but I don't see playing it more than a few times.

Love the theme, the artwork, and how incredibly balanced this game is.  However, it can be a little too balanced as AP inducing decisions can result in minimal difference in points in the end. Overall a Beautiful mixture of drafting, set collection, resource management, action selection and worker placement.

RATING: 8
I bought this at Essen last year after the initial blurb made it look like my sort of game (worker placement and a bit of interaction) and the production values made it look excellent. However when I finally gave some time to the rules I immediately regretted the purchase. There just didn’t seem to be anything to do and hardly any decisions with players simply assembling performers in their circus which give three shows before game end. I guessed I’d been conned into buying a gateway family game by the flash artwork.

However I thought I needed to play it once just to justify the time it spend in my flight bag.  The rules didn’t seem particularly clear and quite fiddly and I was still thinking that this box would be on e-bay the next day as it was a while before we started. 

The early moves were a bit slow, it was hard to see how the extra cards available for purchase (personnel and investment) could influence play. Mix in the special bonuses that performers gain you after a show and some slots for your three actions having a limited availability (and so can be blocked out) and it slowly dawned on me that there was a hell of a lot more going on here than my initial impression suggested.

 

Bottom line, by mid game we were in our stride and all three of us were really enjoying it. So much more so for me because I was amazed that I had absolutely dismissed the game after reading the rules. Its one of those games that you have to play to appreciate it.

Further plays increase the love. Upgraded to an 8.

2 játék: Szabályrendszer sok magyarázatot igényel, mégis a játék nem bonyolult. Könnyű játéknak tartom. Hangulata is jó, bár az aprólékos grafika kicsit nehezen felismerhető jelöléseket alkalmaz. Van egy bizonyos mennyiségű stratégia, de jóformán a nyerési stratégia egy irányba tolja a játékot, mindezt mégsem tudom akkora gondnak felfogni, mert ha nem így lenne nem igazán illene a témába.
Szívesen újrajátszanám, de inkább olyan társasággal, melyben nem csak a játék, hanem a hangulat is fontos szerepet kap.

2011, 2-4p, 90min, wkr pl, economic, recipe filling, voting aspect is just simple majority to see if players want extra rounds before scoring.

Others say (and I agree):
-- dry and tedious
-- an average, dry, cube-pushing worker placement game (like Caylus & Agricola but not as good).
-- the choices feel rather restricted and most decisions are obvious
-- low player interaction
-- very prone to AP (games are 2+ hours)
-- unplayable for colourblind
-- tight economics and direct competition for scarce resources
-- more work than fun
-- some aspects are really annoying/frustrating
-- unbought cards get cheaper each round
-- Investments are very swingy
-- Majority scoring for end-game bonuses
-- Action restriction rules are weird and not clearly indicated
-- 3 shows is not enough to balance out the luck... but at 120 min, the game is already too long.
-- In 2p, the "vote" is really a "veto", which isn't very interesting
-- trailers seem almost worthless (unless you luck into the investment that makes them score points)

Fantastic euro game with incredible art, great components and wonderful theme. Confusing to start (or maybe we're jsut new to euros) but once you get the hang of it, really easy to play. Managing your money, cast and crew for your circus can be quite the challenge, and trying to get the best performers for each city and upcoming city is really difficult. I thought I'd lost for sure the first game, but scores were all fairly close at the end due to the different scoring mechanisms; there's really a lot of variety for what you can get! Definitely will play again!

A funny game with nice art and theme. A not so good german rulebook.
Selling your tickets and transfering your 2 or 3  performer-cubes simultan in a 4 player game saves a bit playing time. I heartly recommend: Ringmaster, Mini-expansion and all the promos you can get, then this is a fascinating Circus, i enjoy everytime it gets to the table. Worth increases up to 8 BGG Points with the Mini expansions and the corrected Final score card.

Solid game. The original theme and magnificent artwork make up for the lack of original mechanics. The vote that decides when a round ends is probably the best idea and provides most of the interaction in the game. The other point of interaction, hiring performers and assistants, is not as important as the cost/vp ratio is similar for most of them. The main issue is the unavoidable AP in the final turn, as you need to max out the money-to-VP conversion.

This game has an awesome theme, wonderful art, and nice components, but runs way, way too long. 

Oh right, and then there's the math. Very few games I have played require so much arithmetical calculation from turn to turn. Money is so tight that the vast majority of the game is spent either 1) getting money or 2) figuring out how much more money you're going to need by the end of the round. I've never put on a show without having used all seven money actions to get the full $26. In fact, the game would be much shorter if everyone just took $26 at the beginning of each round and then started on turn 3.

As it stands, this would be a great game for an accountant who loves his job, or for people who enjoy spending their weekend evenings balancing their checkbooks. For me, it's just too much work for what it is.

A bit on the long side but there's a lot here to like - turns are quick but money is tight enough that paying for the performers you need to deliver VPs is a real challenge.  I'm left with a nagging feeling though that - despite the potential for clever play matching performers with the bonus points on offer etc - the game might be influenced too much by the randomness of the 'investment' cards, some of which are always useful (have some money), whereas others have more limited application (double your vote).

What a great theme for a game and what a good game they made out of it too. Recruit your troupe of performers, get them what they need for their act and perform in different cities to gain as many points as possible. Don't forget all those backstage personnel that may also help you to victory. Looking forward to playing this again. 10 Plays.

RATING: 6.5
The theme is very cool though it's pasted on - but hey, it's a eurogame, and it honestly doesn't matter to me at all; I'm a sucker for mechanics, not for the theme. Nevertheless, I think it's cool that it isn't about shipping goods in the 15th century... But to be fair, everybody did just call the cubes by their colors and not what they are supposed to mean like "costumes" etc.

The game itself is pretty good and doesn't remind me of any other eurogame as it has some unique mechanics going on by flipping your artists. I also like how the different shows move around the world so you can get some bonus points by having the right artists (though personally I think you get too few points for this). 

I have four complaints about the game, which ultimately led me to sell the game. 
The first is that I don't really see why you would want to flip an artist before the final show (yes, you can perhaps save a little money, but the bonus you get for not flipping them in round 2 is probably better). This seems to be the consensus among other players too, which is a shame. 

My second complaint about the game is that, while most of the cards are balanced, two investment cards are certainly not, especially one of them: the one which gives 1 VP for each personnel card you have, which should net you a good handful of points (at least that's been the case in my games). The second is the one which gives you 1 VP for each trailer; if you get a Strong Man or other cards which give you a trailer, you will get a nice amount of points here too. Considering most of the other investment cards give you perhaps 1-3 points, these two cards are just too good in my opinion.

The third is regarding the final scoring: it takes like 5 minutes to calculate your scoring, and that's just not funny. Still, it doesn't bother me that much as the gameplay itself is somewhat interesting. 

This leads my to my final complaint, however, as even though the game is interesting at first, it doesn't have great replayability as it feels "same-y". I cannot see myself playing this 10+ times, probably not even much more than 5 times...

A bit fiddly and constantly having to recompute whether you can pay your salary before every placement gets old. Lots of cube churning but in the end an okay game. Like the variant where you have to pay a coin for each disc already on the spot you are placing (with exception of selling tickets) to add tension and interaction.

Reminds me of Colosseum in a way, with trying to build up your 'performances' throughout the game. However, I prefer Colosseum mainly due to the extra player interaction. Drum Roll is lovely to look at but it feels very mechanical most of the time - everyone just building up their cubes and making sure everything balances etc. I'm not normally bothered by 'pasted on' themes, but here it's harder than usual to imagine what you're doing; performers are really irrelevant - it's just collecting coloured cubes. At least Colosseum's tiles have nice pictures on them!

Not having rules explaining some cards was a bit frustrating. How publishers feel justified doing that is baffling to me.

Hey, we're making circuses, not renaissance villages/castles! Ok, it's a worker placement game that's pretty by-the-numbers. Which isn't to say it's bad. It's pleasant enough. But despite enjoying my first game (with all the KS promos), I'm having a hard time pointing to anything really differentiating about it, other than the theme.

RATING: 4
Drum Roll left a good first impression on my partner: she’s a bit of a sucker for evocative artwork and Drum Roll provides it in spades. I wasn't at all eager to give this game a go for the rules were a bit opaque and stressed the various different cards more than I would like.

Once we began playing, I quickly found out that there really wasn’t much of a novelty game here. The worker placement mechanic is very limited: with only 3 discples and only 4 types of action to place these (resources, money, cards of type 1, cards of type 2) the placement phase is quick, yes, but also boring. There is a little contention, true, but it is quite sensitive to playing order; and since there is no way to annoy another player by removing his discple from a field where he already played it, the tension is usually gone by the second discple already. Most of the game is played on your own, with total focus on first constructing and then wringing dry a small point/money card engine. My partner remarked that she thought the game ‘mechanical’, but what she means is [i]processional[/i]: do A first, then B, then C; repeat.

Drum Roll is a solid game, yes. But it doesn't attempt anything audacious either, let alone try something new: we’ve already seen numerous point-building engines based on a worker placement mechanism; and even if the circus setting is original, I fear that novelty will have worn off within a few games. It always does, and I see no reason why Drum Roll would be the exception. What does it mean that one performer needs a red, a green, and a white cube; while another requests blue, red, and yellow...? No. It looks nice, but I don’t feel the need to play this game again.

RATING: 5
The travelling circus theme is a good idea for a game driven by worker placement.   This game looks great on the table - the colors are bright and the art really “pops”.   However!   The cube functions on the performer cards are so dark and so tiny that they are completely nonfunctional.    It’s a huge graphic design miscue in an otherwise good looking game, and the game definitely suffers for it.   People simply cannot tell what the cards do from a range greater than 2 inches.    Drum Roll falls into a glut of worker placement games that I find particularly frustrating:   way, way, way too long, and you are doing the exact same thing with the same number of workers for far too many rounds.  There’s not enough arc to it.   Agricola, by comparison, has 5 times the development arc that Drum Roll does, and it does it in half the time, with far more interesting decisions.   Here, you do this 20 times:   gather cubes, get money, get performers and helpers, put cubes on performers, pay people, get points.

Drum Roll is a beautiful looking game with a fantastic circus theme and the nicest cards I've seen in any game.  It's a solid worker placement game with some interesting decisions along the way.  At a little over 1 hr 30 mins for a 2 player game it runs a little long but I'm hopeful that the theme and components will mean this one gets plenty of play in the years to come.  TRADED

Played 1/3 of game at Essen 2011. Game consists of three parts, at the end of each part comes showtime. I felt that game was very dry and tedious. Components of the game turned out to be too colourful to my eyes, I was close to feel sick after looking them for about half an hour. 
Why I then wanted to try to play this? Maybe because of theme... and colourful components. =P Beware them, they are treacherous! 

I think the ultimate thing that makes me feel sick are the "gold ornated" frames in each card. I have had this kind of experience before too, 
I began to feel sick at Louvre because there was so much gold and bling everywhere.

The art work of this game is exceptional, however the game play is very abstracted. 

There is very little you can do to interact with your opponents you simply collect cubes, distribute them to best effect, draw random cards for bonus cubes/money/ victory points and hope you draw better ones than your opponent.

It would have been nice if the different performers gave different abilities for example the illusionist is exactly the same as the magician is exactly the same as the escape artist, they are all magical and so all have the exact same ability.

This game feels like a more complicated Colosseum, with giving a whole lot more in terms of different actions available to take.  I typically like cube-pushing games, but this one felt a little too samey to me by the third show. It feels like a lot of work to put on a good show. This is a heavy game, and it can take a while to get familiar with what the various performer and assistant cards do. It`s one of those games where there`s just way too much going on to be able to keep careful tabs on what your opponents are doing and how you can best hinder them.

RATING: 6.5
This is beautifully illustrated and looks fantastic laid out on the table.  

My wife likes this one which is high praise as she is a tough customer when it comes to board games. 

Personally I found it an exercise in cube movement but without the feel that I was actually doing anything really useful by moving the cubes.  An example of this for me would be spending time to get three cubes onto a performer for a great performance.  Come the performance and we simply look at the cubes on the performer and take a reward.  In some cases this can simply be "another cube" so I've spent three cubes to get one back. 

Perhaps I'm missing something here with this game?

We're really enjoying this game. Yes there is a lot to think about with all the different ways to score points, but once you get going, it's not that difficult. All of the promos, expansions, and extras are necessary, I think. And just a note to those thinking of getting the game. First off, get it, and second, only the base cards come in the box. I was under the impression that all of the extras and promos would be included, but I guess that was only to those who backed it when it was rereleased. Go to Artipia's website and order the extra cards. Worth it! Very interesting game, not too samey as many think. Lots of replayability. Permanent spot in my collection.

Hmm-hmm. Kézbe véve nagyon tetszik a hangulata, a grafika pedig egyszerűen pazar. Viszonylag elemi lépésekkel operáló hangulatos worker placementnek gondoltam. Ebből sajna csak a hangulatos nem jött be. 
Valahogy nincs feszültség a játékban, az egész uncsi kockatologatás. Színes kockákat ha megeröltetem magamat se tudom mindek elnevezni, így marad a "kérek két kéket egy pirosért" hangulat. 
Sokat ront még a helyzeten, hogy tematikusan azt várnám, hogy a lehető legnagyobb show-t kell csinálni, nomeg, hogy ez aránylag nehéz legyen, de egyik sincs így. Nem túl komplikált az outtandingeket összehozni, de ha nem sikerül, akkor is érdemes től nagy energiákat őlni bele, mert közepest csinálni, tényleg semmi értelme.
Még csak két fővel proóbáltam, de nem hiszem, hogy ezeken a dolgokon a játékosszám változtatni fog. Azért adok még neki egy esélyt.

Rating based on two plays of 1st edition. This is a heavy worker/action placement game with economic management. There are different strategy paths to take - however you are still going to be fighting over resources with your action placement. It is extremely easy to miscalculate your money and lose victory points. I'm hoping that the funds trackers that were part of the KS will make this mistake less likely.

The game uses a very loose kind of worker placement, with most actions never being blocked. Nonetheless, there is still some interaction in the race for choosing resource cubes, performers and personnel. Your main goal is to hire performers for your circus and equip them with cubes, so that they make a good spectacle to give you various benefits and prestige (victory points). The game works, except for the voting for extra turns with two players. It's a bit too long, but I enjoy it. However, I admit it only rises above mediocrity for me because of the cool (and surprisingly uncommon) theme and pleasant artwork, even though the board background is much too busy. Also, it quickly becomes repetitive without the many Kickstarter promos (which I'm happy to own).

(05/2012) Another generic worker-placement Euro, with a pasted on theme, that overstays its welcome by 60 to 90 minutes.

There are three "shows", with each show (or game turn) consisting of 5 to 7 action phases, where players collect income, resources, investment cards, workers, or hire circus performers. At each show, some of the performers w/ resources are converted into VP.

Unfortunately, I played this after I had played Lords of Waterdeep a number of times. The two games are very similar in mechanics: 1) workers in DR are similar to buildings to LoW--they allow you to convert cubes, get income, or other typical Euro stuff; 2) performers in DR are similar to quests in LoW--you need to collect X number of "resources" to "complete" a card; 3) there is an income spot in both games, although in DR, it increases with every visit; 4) there is an "investment" action in DR, which grants cards similar to the Intrigue cards in LoW; and 4) there are a number of spots to collect the various "resource" cubes in DR, similar to LoW, except cubes represent "training", "equipment", etc., that allow you to "prepare" performers, like clowns, jugglers, knife throwers, etc., to perform in one of three shows to get VP.

In DR, you have three workers to place in a four player game, and you may visit most of the spots several times, regardless of the presence of other players' workers. The equipment spots are the only locations where it is one worker per spot. The competition for these spots is fierce, as everyone is looking for equipment to prepare their featured performers. Beyond that, there is virtually no player interaction, because there is no blocking aside from the equipment, and the first-come-first-served nature of hiring performers.

On my one play, there seemed to be no differentiation between the five resource/equipment types available. Every performer required three distinct cubes to get them to "three star" status, which meant they could be "flipped" over to score VP. They could also be left unflipped, in order to take advantage of their special abilities: convert cubes into income/VP/other cubes, draw investment cards, etc. However, because of the salary cost differential of flipped vs unflipped, it became clear that in most cases, it is best to flip them as soon as possible. For example, a "cannonball man" could be initially be hired for $6. When he is "cubed up" to three-star status, he will generate income of $7 at every show. However, he will need to be paid $6 to remain unflipped to keep this benefit, for a net of $1. If he flips, while only earning only a measly 2 VP, $6 will still need to be paid, yet on subsequent shows, he will only require $1, but with no VP benefit. On the other hand, keeping a magician will allow the player to look through 3x investment cards and choosing one, but if flipped will earn 5 VP.

There seems to be very little granularity in the VP spread (from 1 to 6 VP), versus the investment effort in terms of money and cubes, and because of this, it is rather difficult to discern the relative value of each performer. On the other hand, some of the workers are rather powerful, allowing conversion of one cube into two other types. Getting investment cards can also swing the game due to a random assortment of relatively good stuff.

There are additional VP bonuses for each circus that features the most acts, or offering a variety of acts, or those that have "perfect" performances (i.e., performers that have achieved three-star status). However, in our game, almost everyone was able to achieve these bonuses, so there was very little differentiation.

The player(s) that is lucky enough and well situated enough to be able to grab the relatively powerful workers, hire performers with good resource-to-VP ratios, and find the best investments that feature good combos, will do well in the game.

Since there are 3x shows, each with 5/6/7 action phases, where each action phase is 3x player actions, this means each player has anywhere between 45 to 54 to 63 worker placements! Each action is simple and quick, so there is relatively little downtime. However, compared to LoW, which only has 20 actions for a 5P game, and 28 actions for a 4P game, Drum Roll is easily 2x to 3x as long to play. LoW is quick at about an hour, while Drum Roll slogged along for about 2 to 2.5 hours, for a first game (with practice, I suppose we could come close to the advertised 90 minutes, but it is not worth the investment to me). Even with its somewhat entertaining art and amusing theme, this is not even close to sustaining my attention or interest. I was bored after 30 minutes, and had to suffer through another 90 minutes. It is a solid '4', and really, I don't wish to play this again, especially when there is a fast, clean Euro like Lords of Waterdeep right around the corner.

After 1 play.

I'm on the fence on this one.
It's a very very solid design.  A few years back it might've been a hit.  Right now, after the flood of optimization euro-games, I don't know...  It doesn't stand out of the crowd.
The theme makes it unique (though it's not felt so strongly during the play to be fair), but that's not enough...
Granted, optimization is a nice job to perform here and works smoothly, but still I cannot be sure of answers to these questions:
- do I get enough tension and excitement playing it?
- why the heck I didn't care about the final position? [I've won my only game - to be clear]
- isn't Drum Roll too long/complicated for what it tries to achieve?

My last gripe is very solitare feel when playing it.  Very rarely I looked at what others were doing.  Yeah, you look when they reserve actions you want too (ignoring a thousand of other activities they perform at their circuses), but precise and/or in advance analysis of what they need/will take is next to impossible (too many factors).  Blocking is not efficient for that reason and because there are many rounds to gather what you need.  What's more, you can get better deals suddenly and unexpectedly in later rounds, because the needed performers, helpers etc. might just pop up.
Don't get me wrong.  You _have_ control over you score, but _only_ over your score...

Still, I enjoyed my only play to some degree and I'm willing to play more.  At least to form a final opinion.

EDIT: Upon some reflection - maybe I know some answers to my musings: the game is not tight, streamlined.  Looks like freestyle race for VPs and grabbing them in bunches.  Who gathers the most, wins.  No tension.  Not good.

Super fun worker placement game. I love the theme, and it is' easy to get new people into the game because everything just kind of makes sense. Absolutely gorgeous art for the board and all of the cards and chits. Very interesting decisions about when to give up on performers' special abilities and retire them to save money.

One caveat is that you really need to get some of the promos if you can. They really open the game up and add lots of extra variety. The base cards are a TINY bit same-y and they have duplicates so you'll see lots of the same performers and similar personnel unless you grab some of the new cards.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (December 2013)

Boring game. First of all, I absolutely hate the theme, I hate circus that have animals and tamers in their mists, I don’t think I will ever play this again just for that. Now I understand why some friends refuse to play Andean Abyss (I’m from Colombia) due to the theme. 

The gameplay is also boring for me, I found the game to be very light, you have few interesting choices each turn, most decisions are obvious. The art is good though, but many times I could not distinguish the performers reward, I wish this part was bigger. It is way too long for the level of complexity and depth it offers, for that timeframe I would play any other “put on a show” game out there (Vinhos, Pret a Porter, Dungeon Petz) or many other games.

I don’t think I will be playing this again in the future. I’m rating it a 4.0 due to the theme, without it, it would be a 5.0 for me. An average game. I won’t buy it and I will resist further pays of Drum Roll.

Fairly unique game, has some similarity with the recently released Shakespeare in that you need to get cubes (i.e. costumes) to enhance your characters' performance.  Limited number of actions per round, and it's also one of the few games where the players collectively determine game/round length.  However, in certain situations you can get stuck and not get a necessary cube, plus the special abilities cards that are randomly drawn are not totally balanced.  Nonetheless, a fun game with a unique theme and some unique elements.

Build a circus of characters each worth varying amounts of victory points. Also meet certain criteria at the end such as having each of the five types or having at least eight characters to gain bonus points. Also each character needs to gain three colored cubes to maximize the scoring. These cubes can be collected or can be generated or transformed by other special characters. The game does a nice job of showing the circus theme.

The "flip" mechanism seems like it should be interesting... but it's not. There's really no decision to be made. The benefits for flipping are so minimal that it is almost always the right choice to wait until the game end to flip, so you get the special powers longer. It's a pity, since the theme is great and the presentation is lovely.

Drum Roll is a prototypical small publisher crowdfunding effort. Enthusiastic ideas are not enough developed. The ensuing game is far too long and complicated for not enough gameplay.

Az a típus, ahol egy kicsit meg kell dolgozni azért, hogy lásd a kapcsolatot a funkciók és a körítés között. Sok jó ötlet van benne, gördülékeny a játékmenet, érdekesek a lehetőségek. Talán kicsit túl gyorsan repetitívvá válnak a körök, mert azért viszonylag kevés akcióhely van, de két játék alatt ezt nem éreztem akkora problémának. Kevés tapasztalattal valószínűleg sokkal jobban felpiszkálta volna a fantáziámat a Drum Roll, így azért talán a grafika, a körítés az, ami jobban vonz, nem a mechanika és a játékélmény. De azért egy társasjáték még mindig nem arra való, hogy nézegesse az ember. Nálunk nem.

I love this game, complaints from other players though that there is too much symbolism/information on the cards. The explanation page in the rules seems to support this complaint, however after several plays the symbol sheet is rarely required. This game combines nicely a resource management aspect with a money mechanism that always succesfully tempts me to overstretch myself. If you like resource management games you will love this.

In Drum Roll each player takes over the role of a circus owner in the early 1900s. Each player moves around Europe hiring performers and giving shows.

There are five main categories of performers: the Tamers, the Acrobats, the Bizarre, the Magicians, and the Jugglers. Each of them have different demands the player must fulfill in order to give their best performance.

The requirements, which vary between performers, are Rehearsal, Equipment, Supplies, Costumes, and Promotion. There are three levels of performances that each performer can end up doing in a show: a poor one, a good one, and an outstanding one. The higher the level of performance, the more requirements each performer will have to fulfill in order to achieve it.

RATING: 7
Played once, 4p.  This is a heavily themed resource management/set collection game, with a vote thrown in for extra fun/frustration.  The theme is not really necessary, though, and just exists to provide a framework for the mechanics.  There are several draw decks, and some starting randomness that has some important longterm effects, but the game seemed to work.  However, it can last too long; players need to keep things moving to avoid frustration (true for most games I guess).

RATING: 6
Jury is still out on how I feel about the game.  I enjoy the art with this game despite the busyness.  There really isn't much cut-throat action in the worker placement aspect outside of snagging the cubes and having better choice of the performers and assistants.  The voting aspect regarding an extra round or two is a an interesting touch where you can potentially destroy people's plans if you have enough other voters to assist you.  I do feel like the game tends to take longer than necessary...not sure why this happens although I can't recall feeling bored ever.  There is a lot that can be done at the same time as everyone else if you trust everyone else at the table.

This game completes the Circus themed game void in my collection.  I really like the way this game plays with having to fulfill the levels of your performers and then choosing to either keep them another round and keep their benefit or retiring them in order to not have to pay their salary.  

I think it's mandatory that you order the promo set form the designer that adds 40ish new cards to the game.

Lots of mechanics, very little fun. Game materials looks very nice and inviting but icons on cards are hard to read. Spots on the board where you put your workers could have had better indication on the limitations for putting your workers. Now this is explained on a very confusing summary card.

Once you see behind the nice colorful components and theme, the game is a bit disappointing and needlessly complex. The game's complexity cannot prevent that you get bored from doing quite the same actions over and over for more than 2 hours.

Maybe this game becomes better after you are used to all the icons, cards and concepts. But I still think there is too little going on on the table. Most of the time you are focused on your own cards. 

Pure worker placement and exchanging cubes for other cubes or actions.

A well designed game, but requires more effort than I feel like the strategic depth should allow.  While their are some interesting decisions, I'm not sure if this game will see the table too often just because nothing particularly sticks out as outstanding (except the artwork of course).  

The game takes longer than I'd like as well, but my group does have some AP prone players...

12/04/12 Played 2/3 of a four-player game (which took two hours). 
The heart of the game is basically the same as Colosseum; one needs several types of things to put on a great show, as opposed to a mediocre one. Drum Roll uses resource cubes and cards instead of tiles, but the result is the same. That should have earned it a rating of "7". But the artwork on the cards drags my rating of this game down two notches. First, its too busy and too dark. Its pure hell if one is color blind. Second the important bits (icons, etc.) are tiny with a capital T. Third, there's a tendency to puts things (number, icons, etc.) on top of other things of similar colors. I found it hard to read my own cards that were laying in front of me. Reading anyone else's cards across the table is virtually impossible. And to play the game well you need to be able to do that if you want to screw them over. Otherwise you have no idea what resources they need, and whether it will conflict with your requirements. The game is also harder to explain. It took 45 minutes, whereas I'm sure Colosseum can be explained in 25 minutes. The extra complexity and duration of play does nothing to add to the enjoyment/richness of Drum Roll.

"I really want to like this game, because the art and theme is so interesting and atypical, but the gameplay was a bit too simple, particularly for the game playtime. It's not a bad game by any stretch, but it just wasn't a game for me."

RATING: 5
A perfectly serviceable worker placement game. The theme is compelling and the art is quite good. The graphic design is thematic but inconsistent and jumbled. The play is tight but includes some release valves (namely the ability to extend a round by majority vote). Hiring the right performers (both for point bonuses and their abilities) is key and provides tense decision making. Unfortunately even under the best of circumstances you only make use of an early hire twice which seems to me anti-climactic. I also don't know that there is much variety in strategy other than an engine that gets feeds you lots of cubes. Good, not great, wouldn't seek it out.

The game as you can tell is gorgeous. Easy to learn, but a bit much to teach at first. I very much felt part of the theme with preparing and putting on shows which was a lot of fun, smiles and whistling circus tunes.
You have to call the cubes what they are during the game (costumes, supplies...) and have some imagination about it otherwise it will feel as though you are just moving cubes. 
It is not a good 2 player game at all, I barely had any tension at all with my wife, but it is an awesome 4 player game and has everybody totally stress the whole game. Weird.

As most Artipia games, Drom Roll has stunning visuals that capture very well its colorful and attractive theme: the Circus. Sadly, this theme completely fades away when you start to play. 

The mechanisms were also quite attractive, but the gameplay does not feel convincing. There are very few options, the artists abilities are repetitive, the first move is always the same for all the players (getting equipement) and during most turns, players will dedicate 1 or 2 of their 3 workers to sell tickets. Overall, you do a lot of actions during the game, but you always do the same, and it becomes boring. The gameflow is not slow (even if the games are long) except at the end, because last turns are very mathematical,

The scoring prizes at the end are not well balanced. For example, having 5 staff members almost grants 9 points, a huge ammount. They provide an alternate scoring system that seems better.

Again, an Artipia game with great ideas, great artwork but dissapointing gameplay. It is a good game, but they wasted the opportunity to create a great one. Drum Roll would have benefited greatly from further development and polishing.

RATING: 3
Frustrating, headache-inducing and annoying. [i]Drum Roll[/i] is unplayable for colourblind folks. My rating reflects that difficulty. It also shows my frustration and irritation with the designers and publisher, who clearly gave the issue no thought at all.

[i]Drum Roll[/i] is a clever market-engine game: the players are circus owners who put on a series of shows across Europe. In turn, hire performers and support staff, buy equipment and pay for rehearsals, sell tickets... A great theme, tight economics and direct competition for scarce resources. This game should be absolutely wonderful!

But the resources are coloured cubes! The resources that each performer needs are shown on cards: as miniscule pictures of coloured cubes! It would be a simple design change to remove colour-dependence completely, with symbols and chits. The game would still look brilliant, too. Doing this after the fact is a huge task, requiring replacement of dozens of pieces and altering almost every card.

The rulebook was good - clear and sensibly laid out. The game components are beautiful, notwithstanding the colour problems.

"Long, thinky game with a colorful but thin theme. More work than fun, and a few aspects are really annoying/frustrating."

What I like:
- Worker placement is very Caylus-like
- Unbought cards get cheaper each round

What I don't like:
- Flipping performers is necessary, annoying, and anti-thematic
- Trailers appear to be worthless
- 130 minutes for 2p learning game felt quite long
- Investments are very swingy
- Majority scoring for end-game bonuses
- Action restriction rules are weird and not clearly indicated
- 3 shows is not enough
- In 2p, the "vote" is really a "veto", which isn't very interesting

I didn't really know what to expect, other than that DR was worker placement and "putting on a show". The placement and collection was surprisingly similar to Caylus. As a 45-minute game, it would have been ok, but at over 2 hours it was not one I need to play again.

The whole flipping thing just makes no sense to me thematically, and is more frustrating than interesting mechanically. It's like the engine you are building wants to run for about 10 shows, not 3, but obviously that would make the game insanely long.

Trailers seem almost worthless (unless you luck into the investment that makes them score points). If flipping and trailers were "fixed", I would probably raise my rating by 2 points. Cut the game length in half and it would go up another 1 or 2.

I agree with the BGG-voted weight of 3.0.

Fantastic game that looks amazing.  So colorful!  It's tight worker placement, some set collection, and engine building.  Gotta love that combo!  And the mechanic in which you choose how good of a show each of your performers puts on, is really fun, unique to this game, and creates lots of decisions.  And then, if your performer puts on the best show, you still have to pick which of the two abilities to use, and that creates some great moments.  A whole lot of good game here!

This is a worker placement game that involves drafting "performer" cards who use resource cubes and money to generate points and small rewards.  There are a number of other actions you can take to help you manage your resources.  At least a third of the victory points come at end-game scoring, where generally the player with the best assortment of performers will gain the most points.  I thought that this was a good game, but fairly unremarkable.

It feels like there is something needed just out of reach to make this game greater: it needs to be faster, smoother, more interactive, and more compatible with feeling like a circus show. Gonna still play and give it some time to see if any variant rule ideas come to mind, or if the game, as designed, grows more on me. With a few plays the appeal has dropped for me about a half point in rating.

Regarding First Edition: The illustration quality and theme is splendid, but actual printing and production quality was a touch sub-par. Inks were run much too dark, impacting colorful appeal and legibility in incandescent light. Some of the materials (like player boards) are too thin and cheap-feeling. Lack of an insert contributes to the cheaper quality feeling.

20/08/2013: Received KS purchase

15/09/2013: Played an introductory 2-player game with the missus and had great fun in the process. The gameplay was easy to understand and the respective sections flowed smoothly after the first turn and end show respectively. There was little need to refer to the playbook and this helped a lot.

Some of the imagery on the personnel and investment cards were confusing (largely limited to those which were KS promo bonus materials), as these weren't covered in the rulebook, nor was there a separate attachment listing the functions of these promo cards. Nevertheless, this did nothing to affect the gameplay experience, and I am certainly looking forward to rolling this out with others!

Another addition to the worker placement genre. Gorgeous artwork, but can be fiddly (about as fiddly as Le Harve IMHO) if you have a limited play area. Game play brings nothing new or unique to the table, but the artwork redeems it all.

Après juste une partie (je sais c'est peu). 
La qualité principale du jeu est son graphisme qui fait voir le cirque, ses artistes, etc. Mais ce n'est clairement la seule (qualité). Le jeu tourne bien. Il est même plutôt rapide : on doit placer un pion pour réserver ses actions et on a seulement trois pions. Le temps d'attente est faible. Il faut aussi signaler ces cartes "Investissement", piochées au hasard, elles peuvent carrément changer le décompte final des points. Cela permet sûrement de bluffer un peu dans la partie. 

Avec une seule partie, on peut se faire une idée correcte du jeu mais difficile de dire si il y a une stratégie systématiquement gagnante ou pas.
La note correspond à mon impression du moment : j'aimerai bien y rejouer. Et l'aspect graphique renforce cette envie d'y rejouer : c'est tout de même plus drôle que d'élever des moutons dans une ferme...

I only have two complaints about Drum Roll.

1. It's only 4-player
2. For a game with such beautiful art and a delightful setting, the theme can easily get lost behind the cube pushing and accounting.

Overall, I find this to be a very enjoyable worker placement. Round to round play is tight and scoring is even tighter. The vast array of promos add some nice variety to the game, and I never get tired at looking at the beautiful board and cards. I think an expansion could make this game perfect. Perhaps a secondary board with new circus themed activities.

Very colourful board and bits that seemed to capture the carnival type of mood/atmosphere even if the glue was still wet for the theme transplant.

Game play is divided up into 3 major scoring rounds called 'shows' in the game. Players bid for resources, performers or income each turn, turns run quite smoothly once everyone knows what is happening. 

For me game appeared to run longer than what I would have liked but I think I will play this again if it surfaces in future at the club.

Edit. Nah wont play it again...

RATING: 6.3
+ Beautiful theme
+ Nice intertwined gaming mechanisms
+ 'Feeling of progress' in the course of the game

- Quite some weight on set collection, a gaming mechanism I generally don't like very much
- (not absolutely sure due to lack of experience with the game) Limited strategic possibilities?
- Due to the use of different cards the game lacks overview of special abilities gained by different players
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
As much as I like the theme and art, this one I can foresee will see the table extremely rarely. This is in part due to the length of the game and how unfriendly the shows resolution is. I can't imagine playing the game with more than 2 players. Ever.

RATING: 6.5
A "put on a show" type game with tense action selection. Drum Roll presents a lot of interesting decisions when creating a circus troupe. Each card has an income and VP side, and deciding when to flip to the VP side can be tricky. Resources are extremely tight, and there's plenty of room for some blocking tactics, if only I could see the tiny print on the cards from across the table, which tell me what my opponents need.

That is my only real beef with this solid game: style over function. The art looks fantastic, but I have no idea what my opponent has in his tableau from across the table, especially when the cubes obscure the income results. I really have to squint to see the performer types. I appreciate all the great artwork used for Artipia games, but this is an example of a playtesting failure. Do all Greeks have 20/10 vision? If so, I'm impressed, but everyone sitting at the table, at one point or another, had some issue with the visual presentation of this game. Artipia must be a close-knit community that has fallen into the M.Wallace style of only playtesting within a particular group of people. 

I enjoyed this more than colosseum, but with some Dixit sized cards, and cleaning up the graphic design, this could have been a real winner.

RATING: 7
It's just another cube / convert to VPs game, but it comes together nicely, and although nothing in it is specially unique, it all gels really well together to make a nice game.  However, it doesn't appear to have much replay - every game feels very similar.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very nicely themed game where players arrange a shows with different performers. Players compete for actions each round but it's fairly straightforward. Each player takes a certain color of cube and then 2 other actions. Too many actions are spent on collecting money which is not too exciting. Theme, mechanics and points scoring are good but something is missign - a soul?

RATING: 9
This game is so good that I even enjoy play a 3-player game solo! Under a layer of bright colours and cute graphics there is a game full of hard decisions and many paths to try. Economics are tight and you'll never get everything you want, and you need to evaluate if you should hire someone this round or risk to lose him so you can hire him cheaper. Perhaps that is one of the most critical points of the game; how much will someone help you and at what price will he worth taking him - and for the others too!
A game that I will always bring happily at the table. I believe though that while it will be easy to attract non-gamers and its rules are very simple to teach, it's inner complexity and plenty of calculations may dishearten the new player in the proccess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a bad little worker placement effort. There's multiple methods to get a cube engine going that also keeps an eye on your income generation. There's a good competition for the bonus points going on, which is ultimately what will likely decide what has been engineered to be a close race. Ultimately it's a little let down by being so arithmetic heavy. Everything works elegantly up until you realise just how much counting you're doing. The wages wheel tries to help out, but it's not quite enough. But the ride is still reasonably fun.

Pretty much your average, dry, cube-pushing worker placement game. I do tend like these games; I really enjoy games like Caylus, Stone Age, Agricola and Carson City. But this provided nothing extra or new. Rather, the choices felt rather restriced, interarction and variability were limited, but it's still prone to AP and easily takes up to two hours.

So while I don't regret having played this a few times, I don't feel any desire to ever play it again.

Without a lot of experience, I can't imagine how one is supposed to ascertain opponents' circuses, which greatly affects interaction, strategy, and tactics. Some of the cards are bewildering, too.

The variety of performers and their affects is very cool. I have no problem at all with the colored cube mechanic abstracting the needs of each individual performer. 

The theme presented here is outstanding. Let me repeat that - outstanding.

This is a very solid and well-balanced design. I have (and played with) all the expansions, and enjoyed it immensely.

Did an initial play through tonight (1.22.12) and enjoyed it, immediately set it up and played through a second time.  
It def has a 'euro' game feel to it, but the theme is what pulls it through.  Fun, easy to learn mechanics, with some difficult decision making.  Do you take what benefits you, or do you take something you know someone else needs.  Do you buy a performer to add to your circus because you need him the next round and you want to keep him from your opponent? 
Lots of fun decisions, good depth.  Could use more cards, but I'm sure the 'Ringmaster' promotion will help add more depth.  I'm positive that this will have expansions, I couldn't see them not adding new performers to this, especially set in the 1900's there are a lot of acts that could be done here.  Freak show performers, etc...
Looking forward to getting this game to the table more.

First Impression:

A light euro that makes for a heavy experience.

Luckless and pretty (great artwork!), this game appears to have potential.

But, it outstays its' welcome (really, 3h for a light euro?), it's too low on interaction (4 "oscars" but only one competitive? what are the others for, to make sure none strays from optimal play?) and the artwork is badly implemented (it gets tiring and inpractical as it spreads into areas that should have been left clear). The low interaction along with a general ease of play create a game where everyone achieves everything, which annihilates any potential replayability and makes tough choices a distant dream.

In the end, it's worth a try, but there are better games for what it offers.

Very fun worker placement but without the blocking out of other players that people tend to hate. If you find you didn't like that aspect to say Agricola this game fixes that by limiting the number of times a player can take an action per round. Intuitive and fun with as I'm sure you have read time and time again...beautiful artwork that does a good job of bringing you into the theme. Tough choices in this one for a game with so few options. Love it.

I really love the idea of Drum Roll. You are building up a circus act, gathering equipment, hiring personnel who give you special abilities every round, hiring performers who will do special things during your shows (provided they have the appropriate equipment), and gearing up for three performances in different cities. There are bonuses for having the right types of performers in different cities which you can plan ahead for. There is a market for personnel and performers and those unhired get cheaper over time. Every person you hire has an initial hire cost and a salary that must be paid at every show. There are also investment cards that give either an immediate bonus which you can forgo for a point at game end, or an endgame scoring bonus. Performances happen sometime after the fifth preparation round and players vote in the fifth and sixth rounds to see if a show happens, and it goes on regardless at the end of the seventh round. You prepare for and then perform three shows. There are all sorts of bonuses for size and variety, etc. at game end.

I like the game, but my problem is the one random element, the investment cards. I started the game with performers that gave me an advantage in drawing investment cards and over the course of the game I saw about 18 investment cards and got to take 10 of them into my hand. The goal was to get high scoring endgame cards. I ended up finding two of those, which was half of the number I could keep in my hand. The other two cards I kept only scored me a single point each. Most of the other cards I used to get a few resources or money, but a couple I had to discard to no benefit at all. Another player also tried this strategy and ended up with almost no points from investment cards at all. The winner didn't go this route but lucked into a few good scoring cards.

Drum roll is a solid game, as long as you manage your expectations. That's tough to do, as the art and components are absolutely stunning. Whimsical, fun and completely evocative of old time circus posters, just sitting down at the table makes you feel like you are about to take a shot at running a real circus. Unfortunately, the experience you get is more like a complicated efficiency test than a trip to see Cirque de Soleil.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's a solid and interesting game. There is a fairly deep puzzle here and the player that does the best job connecting the dots will win, which is high praise for an efficiency focused Euro game. I think that's why this game has such a spotty rating. The art evokes imagination, but the game fails to deliver a narrative. Your Strong Man gives you private trailers when he performs, your monkey troupe gives you costume cubes? It's a lot of nonsense when you breakdown the inputs and outputs.

Yet the puzzle IS interesting. Figuring out what order to let your performers put on their shows, figuring out who should get the most access to resource cubes and who can wait...all of this is thinky and interesting. Basically, when I put on my role playing hat, I am disappointed but when I switch to my strategy hat I'm impressed. Confusing, right?

Economic sim as circus owners managing all aspects of the Greatest Show on Earth. Each player has a Big Top player board for their shows. Card auction to hire the best performers to give the people what they want at each location tile. Successful shows require a balancing act at the worker placement board with limited time to rehearse, get props, make costumes, sell tickets, hire agents, promote, and organize staff. Don't forget to make payroll.  Pretty straightforward worker placement with some clever tweaks that add some spark to the action spaces. Nice components and colorful art sets the theme.

very uninspired euro (I usually like euros). Theme is pasted on at best, do yourself a favor and try something else.

I jumped at this one only for its artworks. Have played just one incomplete game ever since I purchased my copy. The chance that this game will hit our table is very slim for most of the time our meeting gather 6 people...

Sweet circus theme with simple worker placement... Resources are tight and you have to know when to keep your performers for their abilities or retire them for points... Gotta keep your cash flow up or you will get hosed... Awesome game!

Drum Roll is a very enjoyable worker placement game. It plays quickly, only slowing down slightly during the shows, and while you face some tough decisions they don't tend to induce (much) analysis paralysis - and I should know, as I'm very prone to AP.

The art is highly thematic, the iconography great, and the game is easy to teach and learn. I highly recommend it. Drum Roll replaces both Stone Age and The Pillars of the Earth in my collection. Even my soon to be 9 year old daughter Ella has played and really enjoyed the game.

This is an economical worker placement game, and at first it may seem more tactics based than strategy dependent, but that is not the case. First of all you know exactly which three cities you will perform in from the start of the game, and can plan which Performers to hire based around this fact, trying to earn an extra 12 VP. Second, each type of Performer grants certain bonuses, some are definitely a lot better at the beginning of the game, and others towards the end. Plan accordingly. Third, you also know the four end-game goals (Largest Show, Full Variety, Perfect Show, and Large Troupe).

Tactics still weigh in heavily due to the nature of it being a worker placement game, and the Performers and Personnel cards are randomly made available, and the Investment cards purchased blindly, but this adds to the fun puzzle of meeting the game's goals. It's highly enjoyable!

The shows themselves are a lot of fun, and actually quite thematic (if played out, especially in the voice of a circus ringmaster). You decide in which order each performer hits the circus ring, and this is highly important as the performance bonuses may make or break your shows. I enjoy the show part of this game a lot, it allows you the opportunity to pat yourself on the back for a job well done, especially if you manage to pull off a juicy combo.

The benefits of the performance bonuses of the five performer types (six with the expansion 'Oriental') should be weighed against the cost of flipping them (making them star attractions and partners in the circus). Some are better to flip early, others late, and it all depends on the synergies of your specific personnel and performers.

This is one of my favorite worker placement games. It's a great game, go out and play it!

[b]Note on Promotional Items:[/b]
Please read my opinion on the game's (first) three promotional items, I believe that the game should've included the Performer Promo Cards (two sets) and Ringmaster as the game is much better for it! I also recommend that you hunt down the SPIEL '11 promotional performer, the Plate Spinner (of the new Oriental type) for further variety.

I look forward to a potential future expansion consisting of three new Oriental performers to round out that set and bring the game up to a total of six actual performers types in order to receive the full end-game bonus for Full Variety.

We haven't played it more than once. The game was enjoyable, but in the end it went on for too long. The art is very colourful and even people, that didn't like the theme at the beginning, thought it was nice in the end. But we have too many other games we prefer to play so we didn't get around playing it again.

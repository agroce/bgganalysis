We’ve (my oldest son and I) really enjoyed our plays of this, but they’ve been 2 player only and something definitely feels lacking at that player count.

better with team because it is very nasty , 
2 tiles are strong : catapult to send meeples on defence tiles and recycle to put your dead meeple on your warehouse.

I like to play this game with my wife against my two boys.

Play this game with two teams , and the first team who gets 12 points , is the winner.
turn play: team A , team B , team A and team B
it's work well ..
I think the game is a little disfonctionnal because there is a way to win as playing always the same buildings : first the catapult.....

Liking this game more and more after several 2 player rounds. Very condensed, but surprisingly strategic hybrid of worker placement and war game. Seemed a bit unbalanced at first, but evens out after getting used to the mechanics. Can be over quite fast, but also turn into a longer, but very entertaining, battle of attrition. Great art, looks very Carcassonne-ish on the table. Should be even better with 3 or 4 players.

Each player starts with a home town with one production building, by means of which he can produce soldiers and send them into the field (hex-tile)just in front of his home town gate, or build a new building. The town can hold a maximum of 4 buildings. Every player has the same portfolio of buildings to choose from. Each building gives specific actions.
The objective is to gain 6 victory points by destroying other players' buildings, or by fighting on the map which is extended with new tiles as the soldiers explore the world. The tiles can offer extra production possibilities, scoring possibilities (towers and altars), movement (mines and tunnels). The fact that the map is built during play is a clear plus to the game, which increases replayability.
My first game played gave me the impression that in order to win the game you need the building by means of which you can parachute a soldier onto the ramparts of another player's building, because destroying buildings offers a direct way to victory points, while the indirect way by means of the collection of bravery points, of which you need 7 for each victory point, works much slower. Then again, maybe the game offers possibilities to counter the overpowering influence of this building. More plays are necessary to sort this out.

bought this game @ Essen because I was interested in artwork and gameplay. After I played this game for the first time (3p), it didn't hit the table anymore since then because I had more expectations from this one.
Until last week. I decided to give it another go. And OMG... I'm addicted to this game. So much fun, tactics, strategy... it seems to be an easy game, and the flow of the game is rather easy (every turn 5 simple steps), but this game has so much dept. It plays differently with 2, 3 and 4 players (different set up) and is soooooo goooooood. I love the 2p variant! Read the rules carefully, and try this one a few times. Its such a great game! This game can be played in 1h, or 30 min. And after you played this one, you definitly want a rematch. Mark my words! Good job mr. Valembois!

Cute, relatively quick turn based RTS simulation. Yes, it's oxymoron but it really works. You recruit meeples, you build additional buildings which require few turns to activate, you explore new tiles. It's completely deterministic, except the exploration part and random map setup due to exploration, but the core of the game drills down to careful calculation and planning. Destroying buildings is somewhat counter intuitive. It's pretty solid game, although components are not inviting and graphic design is tedious.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Reacting to your opponents plans by quickly completing counter measure buildings.

I loved the building mechanics. Moreover, we have some sort of 4X Games, easy to learn, not too long, interesting to play. However, every play is kinda the same. After 5-7 plays I'm enough of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting game and mechanics, but the implementation could use some work - there just isn't enough variability to ensure replayability. All the factions are the same, no asymmetric powers to explore. All the buildings are the same - there are some that are better than others, leaving it a no-brainer to build first. After a few games, there should be a strong prevailing strategy and it's up to the players to be the first to get there, leaving it as more of a race game than strategy. 

There needs to be an expansion to make the factions asymmetric with differing/balanced buildings as well as more varied units (such as archers, tanks, spell users) in order to mix it up a bit. Plays are all 2-player, from the comments, the game may play different with more.

Overall, I enjoyed my plays, but wish there was more oomph.

Nehezen tudom értékelni, mert a szabály és az első pár köt alapján tetszett, Poénos, aránylag egyszerű, de azért volt benne agyalni való is. Viszont az egyik játékos a 3. körben megynerte, pedig láthatóan nem volt ilyen szándéka a készítőknek. Bizonyára lehetett volna jobban figyelni rá, de akkor is hibásnak gondolom azt a játékot, amit be lehet tolni várható játékidő 10-20%-nál. Mindenképp kéne még adni neki egy esélyt, ezekkel a tapasztalatokkal felvértezve, mert alapjaiban jó játéknak tűnik.
----
Második játék után se tűnt jobbnak. Az új kiadás semmit se javít, gyakorlatilag csak a cmon logó került a dobozra, de se alkatrészekben, se szabályban nem láttam változást.
Nem rosszak a mechanikák, elmondva kifejezetten izgalmasnak tűnik, de egyáltalán nem áll össze játékká, szinte nincs benne komolyabb döntés, csak totál egyértelmű lépegetés.

Anyone familiar with Age of Empires will recognise this. It's straightforward but there are some nice touches of complexity such as being able to use the trees to your advantage. Need to play more to get a handle on all the buildings the catapult seems a little overpowered at first, but there are many ways to win.

Picked up a copy in Cannes. The oversized game caught my attention. Simple rules and quite nice looking. The play rewards attacking, combat is one for one, no dice. I like the tunnels and caverns which allow popping up across the board, and sacrifices to get valour. Choice of buildings will allow strategy to develop in different directions. You need to be aware of where other players are, and the timings of effects from their buildings.

Jeder Spieler hat ein Heimatdorf, in das er mit Aktionen bis zu 4 Stadtviertel bauen kann. Jedes Viertel bringt einem potentielle Aktionen, je nachdem was sich der Spieler ausgesucht hat. Manche bauen Meeple in die Werkstatt, machne Aktionen bringen Meeple von dort ins freie Feld, Manche (Katapult) schiessen sogar Meeple auf Gegnergruppen oder in gegnerische Häuser.
Nachdem man Aktionen gemacht hat, darf sich jeder eigene Meeple 1 Feld weit bewegen. Kämpfe werden 1:1 durchgeführt, heisst für jeden angreifenden Meeple stirbt 1 Verteidiger, dabei aber auch der Angreifer (1:1 eben). Der Angreifer hat aber dennoch einen kleinen Vorteil, er erhält mehr potentielle Siegpunkte dafür. Seine Meeples kann man auch beim Gegner einmarschieren lassen, was ebenfalls potentielle Siegpunkte bringt (aber erst, wenn genug fremde Meeples im Stadtviertel sind um es zu zerstören).
Insgesammt sehr flottes und lustiges Spiel.

Haven't played, but impressions are based on hearing the rules and how the game plays.  Love the idea behind how buildings are built  Hope other games are developed around the idea - especially some sort of city building game.  Will definitely try to obtain a copy of Meeple War, at some point in time.

I like Meeple War, it's an easy to learn game with a real time strategy feel to it. My only gripe is that it has that feeling that "Citadels" has, where it goes on entirely too long as players play "tug of war" with the last couple of points to end the game.

It's a great game that's best played with at least three players. Two players is also possible but it's not nearly as interesting since the enemy base is so far away that you basically ignore each other for a big part of the game, looking for specific bonus structures and only engaging in combat if you can gain the bonus of such a structure or at least make your opponent lose that bonus. It's a smart game where the one with the bigger army doesn't essentially win the game but can actually lose if he's not using the correct buildings. There are also certain buildings which are pretty much useless when only two players are playing which is another reason why you should at least have three. The game itself is very fun, with a little luck involved when you're exploring new areas, but mostly tactics and watching your opponent's moves. If you're looking for an intriguing board game with loads of fun, this is the game for you!

Slow start that snowballs as the game goes. I didn't mind it, but the rules are a touch unclear in certain spots. I would play it again, but not something I'm going to request. I wish they would have used larger meeples. The small ones are kind of a pain in the ass to move around. Not to mention you can have turns where you don't do anything but move 2-3 cubes and pass the turn. Still, the game seemed like it has a few plays in it before I feel like I've seen everything. It's trying to simulate an RTS, but doesn't do it as smoothly as I think it should be handled.

Longer to play than advertised, by quite a bit (e.g. 90-120 mins)

A decent little 4X game. With perfect info a no real random element (aside from exploration), bogs down into the usual AP and kingmaking problems.

Honestly, a terrible game of no originality, slow and boring, with some evident problems. From what we understood, the catapult itself is so exceptionally strong that it is a forced building.
The worst thing is that half of us spent half of their turns simply putting back their white workers: for half the time, this game is just not a game, it's only a cubes moving boring passtime.

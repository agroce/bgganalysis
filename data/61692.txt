Good game, the componets are very good quality in this edition, but the game is a little bit old and not too much to do at all but defend and attack, a simple war game. It represents very well the feeling of the II World War, and the tatics with the different units are very complex. The real problem with this game is that it is a little boring because of the long playtime and lack of depht.

RATING: 5
More units and more areas cut up for more mayhem. Dice rolled dependent with amassing the biggest army syndrome mixed into one. 

Nothing more than an enlarged AnA game that could easily be satisfied with AnA 1942. Too large for its own good. 

Love the minis though.

6/8/13: Will probably never play with the first edition rules again.  The second edition rules help the play balance.


Realistically I'm only going to play this together with the 1940 Pacific game and as a result it will rarely get to the table.  This was released not fully cooked, and if you are interested, you probably ought to check Axis&Allies.org for the latest Alpha rules.

On the plus side I do like the inclusion of naval bases and airfields as well as most of the new rules.  The game is becoming more complex.

One of the downsides is that the new technology development rules don't seem to work for our group, too little incentive to develop the money is best spent elsewhere.

Like some other recent Hasbro products I think that the push to cut production costs has noticeably lowered the quality of the end product, and this is overpriced for what you get. 

There has been some pretty significant post-introduction tinkering with the rules.  Make sure you get them before you start playing.  Hopefully they will be included in the next printing of the game.

Axis & Allies starts off as a fun game, it ends up dragging on much longer than it needs to. The winner is usually obvious after the first few rounds, but the game normally  lasts for several hours afterwards.


Additionally, the game lacks replay value and quickly gets stale because each side must follow a set strategy to win. The Axis must immediately take out France, and quickly overwhelm the Soviets to win. The Soviets must simply stall for time while the Americans and British must try to invade France.

Now where lies the Weekend and time for a GLOBAL 1940 in 2011?! I wish and recommend it, to play with 2 Axis vs. 2 Allied players. So you can afford a brain-break over the long playing time of 12 to 18 hours. That are so many troops, that you can easy loose the sight for all your countries after 4 hours of gameplay!

RATING: 3
Really didn't get why this is loved. None of us really enjoyed this at all. Considering how random the combat is, and hence how low tactical depth is, the raw playtime and plethora of rules feels like a mockery of the players. Complexity added just to spite the players. It adds that the game is as fiddly as the tiny boxed Tiny Epic games are. With plastic miniatures reminding me of the hundred bags of military men I used to blow up with fireworks as a kid. There's really very little to this other than some neat historical accuracy like how France will virtually always be overrun by Germany in one fell swoop.

I prefer to play this version of A&A as the Global version with the Pacific 1940. I would rate the global as an 8. The Global version has greater decisions to be made considering the National Objectives and declaration of war element. Having the two big boards laid out on the table really provides that Global scale and looks awesome with all the units placed. I love playing it and I think is best suited to 4 players, game time is long, but you never know when the dice will roll your way for that one crucial battle.

Axis and Allies is a classic.  The 1940 editions ramps it up with a diverse suite of playing pieces and nations.  I've had the game for a while but haven't play Europe separately; I've always linked it with the Pacific board.  The game takes a long time, particularly with two players.  I find personally I get a bit of 'paralysis by analysis' the more experienced you become as you constantly run the odds of battle in your head.  However, the fun of moving fleets around the Atlantic, fighting through the islands of the Pacific and running dangerous strategic boming runs gets you in the game.

RATING: 7
The rating is for the 2nd ed, Europe board only, i.e. not for 1940 Global.

A&A taken at the new level of complexity and scale. Unfortunately, the game takes too long and the components are less functional than they should be.

The components are good overall but somewhat lacking in functionality. The board is big and colourful, which makes it great to look at, except when you need to see the borders of provinces at a glance. There are lots of plastic miniatures of good quality. Most of them also look good although there are a few exceptions, especially in the 2nd edition, e.g. British mech inf, which is an ugly lump of plastic. Many units are nation specific, that is the sculpt is based on some iconic tank, plane etc type. The 2nd edition has more of these specific sculpts. Unfortunately not all the sculpts are sufficiently distinctive. For instance, French cruisers and destroyers are difficult to tell apart. In general, you have enough of the units, however, in our games we keep running out of plastic chips and certain pieces, such as German strategic bombers. The cardboard components are OK. Unlike in most earlier A&A games there is no paper IPC provided, which is a shame considering the high cost of the game. Inexplicably, there is no system for moving big armies around despite the facts that this game has bigger armies than previous A&A games and that simple solutions to this problem have been already invented, see e.g. the battle cards of the Revised edition.

The gameplay is fine overall, except a few issues. First, I personally dislike the political rules. A&A has always been about total war but in this edition several nations start at peace and often stay that way half of the game. Boring! Second, national advantages, that is bonus money. The bonuses could be an excellent way to make alternative strategies viable. Unfortunately, many of the bonuses constrain rather than enable.  The bonuses are supposedly historic. I do not get it. In my opinion sacrificing gameplay for ‘historic simulation’ reasons is a very bad call in a light game like A&A.  Thirdly, the rules for true neutral countries. You almost never want to attack true neutrals. This yet another example of constraining gameplay for historic 'accuracy'.  

The rules are more complex than in previous A&A games primarily due political rules and airfields and ports. The game is more ‘massive’ than earlier editions, including the Anniversary edition. That is, bigger map, more money and units etc. This is both good and bad. Good because it gives scope and makes individual die rolls less important. Bad because it makes the games long:  approximately 6-8 hours.  

The following comment is about 1940 Global. You have a huge map, tons of units and lot of money to customize your armies. Is it good? Well it depends. Do you have a dedicated group of players who are willing to spend 15-20 hours on a game? Obviously, you cannot reasonably do it in one sitting. So you also need a spare table in a quiet corner because it is not reasonable to pack the game between the sessions. Did I mention that you need a really big spare table: like 1,5m x 1m? In short, I think the Global game is too demanding for most groups.  As regards the global gameplay on the Europe side then the setup is the same but the main difference comes from the fact that US is free to decide wheter to focus on Pacific or Atlantic. That said, I think that there is too little interaction between the Pacific and Europe boards.  This is further reinforced by some of the National Advantages. You also have the random and unbalanced optional technology rules. This is no news, of course. A&A tech always have been this way.

Amazing Axis & Allies production game.  Europe 1940 has heightened the difficulty level to a basic war game.  Play is involved and forces players to think much more than in previous Axis & Allies games.

RATING: 8
This is a really good game. The rules have expanded quite a bit since the original version. Its complex and therefore there are many ways to win. Understanding the rules is quite an effort. But I really enjoy diving into rules. The tension is this game is high. When an epic battle begins you can tell that the players feel that the stakes are high. I really like the A&A battle engine. I think its the best across all war board games. These battles create an excellent gaming experience. 
Pros: 
* A very fun enveloping game!
* tension is high
* Strategy: There are many ways to attack your opponent. For every strategy there are good counter measures. 
* the plastic game pieces are high quality - each power has their own ships based on WWII ships
* the board is large & decent enough quality
* the rule book is pretty good

Cons: 
* at $90 per, it costs $180 for the full experience ($60/$120 at TWS)
* The battle board is an important component in this game. It serves as a guide during battle and is an important reference. They provided a minimized board with missing references and cheap card stock. Why?
* some of the ships look so much alike you have to reference a silhouette reference sheet
* they left out some of the reference boards used in previous versions. 
* you have to create your own quick reference
* they left out the paper money, which is odd. Instead we used poker chips which worked out really well. 
I'm printing out some BGG reference material to make up for the missing reference boards. 
I got the idea of using poker chips from BGG on Powergrid. This is a really good idea. It works much better than paper money and stacks easily in a small space. 

After playing nearly a full game this winter. I'd have to say that A&A is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. 

The reason A&A doesn't get much love is because it take too much commitment - the game is too long. 

Its been a couple of years since we've played.

Love this game, it's prob my number one game, but play length scares my friends away.  I think we have moved into an era of gaming where if you have to wait more than 5 minutes for your turn people just scoff and spit!

I have come to the conclusion that you should only play this with 2 players.

Have only played the total world game.  But with that said this game seems to be very well balanced and quite a joy to play.  With new players it can take quite awhile (8 hours last time), and the game still is far too dependant on dice rolls for combat.  This is a problem because a single infantry unit can potentially hold off 100 tanks (it does happen, luckily not often).  And just like the pacific version of the game the number of units in combat is greatly reduced such that determining an advantage in combat is much easier to do in your head.

RATING: 9
The title doesn't leave much to the imagination. Relive WWII in Europe and Africa. Yes, that Africa part was left to the imagination... Expand your country in order to increase production capacity. You can produce a lot of different army types for the battle on land, on sea and in the air. When you start playing, make sure you have a couple of days on which you didn't plan to do anything else than just playing this game. Once it has started, you won't be able to stop until the war is over.

8/25/2010: Just picked up my copy from my FLGS (Gamemasters, in Pittsburgh, PA). Looks great, and the Global rules fix the political situation in the Pacific, which was a little messed up in the Pacific edition. I expect we will play the Global version more than either theater separately.

Played the Global Revised (2nd edition) Rules only. Excellent game, and one that I look forward to playing again now that I understand how new rules, units, and National Objectives work. Quite a bit more rules introduced (and playtime, since it starts at 1940!) in this version.

Especially fun are the naval bases and airbases. Very strong advantages and each provides some interesting opportunities for clever play. I also appreciate the nuances provided by the political rules. It will be fun to explore different approaches with the various powers. 

The downsides of this game are the production quality issues. There is no money included in the game. There are storage boxes for the powers' units and you basically must dump all these pieces (along with the control markers) into one box. As a result, digging through to find a particular piece is a pain. A third gripe I have is with the board. While it looks beautiful and the spaces are fully functional, the peripheral could easily fit a quick Order of Play reminder, perhaps with starting income. Additionally, it would be nice to have a player aid that listed the powers' national objectives. Most of the rules referencing was just re-referencing these national objectives. And each game only comes with 6 dice?

Overall though, it was a great game experience. Rating it based on a 2-player game only, as I think it would suffer with more players, due to the extended downtime and lack of coordination between allied powers.

Love this game! A great improvement above the original. Very tense. If playing Germany, you can't hope for Japanese help. Italy is it's own country which adds to the flavor. France is defeated early but I'm glad they are in it. This would have been a 10 but they didn't include IPC's (paper money).

Global 40 is awesome to behold. Thank you Larry Harris and WotC for bringing this gargantuan vision to life. On it's own Europe40 seems more balanced and production quality is improved over Pac40(enough tac bombers, a workable IPC track,and cardboard bits that better reflect the price). OOB set-upand rules for Global40 aren't perfect but Larry Harris is working with players to create a more balanced game(version alpha+1 as I write this) that will hopefully result in something final. If you're a fan of the franchise the only real question now is do you have somewhere to play this 70x32 beast?

Comments apply to A&A Global 1940:

The game, which gets my best A&A rating, is the latest effort to make A&A less deterministic and I think it has succeeded in giving players more options. You can get more varied outcomes instead of the usual "get-to-Moscow" gambit. However, it achieves this at the cost of being a much more complex game, with a lot more rules and a lot more fiddlyness. And a lot more $$$ too.

And again, playing to the end is just absolutely ridiculous (I don't know why A&A can't fix this perennial problem). One side should just resign when it's clear they're losing.

As for downtime, it is actually not too bad as players can sometimes run moves concurrently on the Europe and Pacific side (because this game is so huge) if they don't affect each other. The double-hatting of certain roles also breaks up the downtime for some players.

[b]Components[/b]: Hasbro has the resources to mass-produce some of the best pieces and boards in the industry.

[b]Rules and Mechanics[/b]: Contrary to popular belief, there is very little luck in A&A games.  Ironically this is due to so many dice rolled each combat: the more dice rolled, the more the results approach statistically expected outcomes.  Good players simply do not lose to worse players.  The last person I taught this game to reckoned that the game was 50% luck dependent after his first game.  After his tenth game he revised his estimate down to 5-10%.

[b]Overall[/b]:  A great ETO-focused version of a classic game.  It may not be an accurate simulation of the second World War, but verisimilitude is not always necessary to make a solid light wargame.  The A&A system really never gets boring for me because it rewards the ability to "read" the state of the board and respond dynamically.  The game is really long if played until the bitter end, so don't; just play until one player's will is broken.

Axis & Allies is epic and well-made, but I tend to find it much too repetitive for a game that takes so long to play. But for what it is, it is very well thought out and well-balanced. If you're looking for an epic war game, this might just be the one you're looking for!

Full disclosure: I have only played this game when combined with Axis & Allies 1940 Pacific, and therefore I am really reviewing the combined products.  That said, I love the combined game.  The aesthetics are nice overall; the models are very cool and differinitaled for all powers (Italy shares a few things with Germany), the map is well designed,, and IN GENERAL you have adequate pieces for most usual scenarios.

The scope of the game is epic, with a board no basketball player could reach across (widthwise).  With our group of friends, we tend to play long grueling games that grind for well over 10 hours; but that's the way we like it!  If that's not for you, I would avoid a game that can takes almost an hour to set up.

Downsides:  This game out of the box was grossly unbalanced against the Axis.  While I have no love for the historical Axis, this makes for a boring game.  There are many errata for poorly tested rules, and at least 4 alternative set ups that I am aware of.  We tend to use the Alpha 2 set up, which just kind of gives the Axis a bit more opening punch and changes the objectives sensibly.  We have found Alpha 2 quite balanced, and without having to learn a completely new set up and gameplay rules that some of the others have.

There are not enough Tactical bombers for the Japanese.
Overall there could be more chips, but crafty gamers can use substitutes or in our case plunder other A&A games.

In spite of all this, I am admittedly still stunned by the grand nature of the combined map, and I find it hard to go back to the smaller boards after the playing this one.  A&A 1940 is far from the best A&A, and certainly not the best thought out/play tested.  That said, with a few adjustment and home rules (BGG has tons), A&A 1940 will scratch even the most persistent WW 2 gamer itch!

Incredible to behold when set up, but daunting amount of time required to finish. Perhaps the 2004 MB edition is more reasonable as far as play time. That being said, out of all the incarnations of A&A, this (mated with Pacific 1940) is the grandest of all A&A versions- both visually/aesthetically and as far as gameplay- so it is THE version to own along with A&A Pacific 1940.

Simple yet fun game. A beer & pretzels wargame to play even with non-grognards. With too many people the downtime per player increases drastically, so it is best played with 2-4 players (linked with pacific 1940).

My group has played the “Global” option (this combined with Axis & Allies Pacific 1940), and had a good time, as much for the company as for the history. I don’t own it and won’t buy it. It’s WWII in very broad brush strokes with no time scale. It follows the historical pattern, roughly. The three Axis dudes make some impressive advances (even Italy if played right) at first, but, if they don’t win via the victory conditions or talk the Allies into giving up, the Allies will win, a long long time from now. The map’s pretty and the pieces are what they should be, little toys to attract folks, but I could have done with 5/8” counters instead. The ships are bad; it’s hard to distinguish between cruisers, destroyers, and transports. Our group can accommodate eight players, but one waits a while between turns (ideally plotting purchases and moves).

I always enjoyed playing A&A since my youth, now I am playing it with my kids. Europe  '40 is imho slightly less exciting than Pacific '40, due to quite predictable mandatory France / Africa / Soviet Union campaigns, but still great to play. 

Better played combined with Pacific '40.

Setup takes FOREVER, but man is it fun. A few friends are WW2 obsessed, so they LOVE this game. 

Most of the rules aren't insanely complicated by themselves, but when you start stacking them together it can get tricky. And then there's Aquatic Assaults and Scrambling. Hoo boy.

RATING: 5
This and Pacific counter part are fun light wargames game. Was my first "real" boardgame purchase once discovering boardgames again.Had an epic two night game with brother and friend. It's obviously a classic. I usually play the combined 1940 beasts combined (4 maps). However, rarely get to the table as the rules overhead and game length is just to long for buckets of dice.

Fun game but the game length for decision making is not worth the time investment.

Very nice. Got this along with A&A Pacific 1940 as a combined Birthday/Christmas present for myself - and to celebrate 25 years of board/war gaming when I first got A&A as a birthday present. 

The game is good. very simple mechanics compared to what I'm used to, yet there's enough here to keep my interest. This rating is based on 1 play. I like it a little better to A&A Pacific 1940, but then that's mostly because where my natural bias in interest is anyway. I can't wait to combine them for a Global game!

I bought this at Gen Con 2010 at the Cool stuff inc booth. As part of their ding and dent sale, I got this game for a really good deal. However, it was sold to me as "Axis and Allies Europe 1940: Frag Grenade Edition." When I got it, the box was caved in, seriously damaged. What you're getting is an original box fixed with tape, the tops of the troop boxes with the army info on them, but no boxes. the troops are stored in a Plano tackle box. the board, dice, etc are just fine and all the miniatures are intact. Make me an offer on this one, you'll get a good deal.

The most important thing I can say about this game is that I taught it to my 11-year-old son and three of his friends and they played it for an entire day -- to the amazement of their parents -- and at the end were wanting more.  It's easy to criticize this game on its history and its mechanics (which is why I make it an 8 instead of 10), but it does an awesome job drawing in new gamers.  It is the kind of game the hobby needed for a long time.

A lot of great new mechanics and ships and others pieces that have been added to the A&A 2004 edition.  The new countries and politics all see fun.  But this game is going to take forever to complete without a timer.  It could be completed in one day but I would have to allocate at least 6-10 hours for this game and would probably want to complete over 2 days.

I love Axis and Allies, and I love this incarnation. Tremendous pieces, awesome map and great gameplay. However problems include: immense playing time (1-2 days, especially when combined with Pacific 1940), the sheer amount of space required, and a lack of opponents. However a great great game that I just wish I could get to the table more.

RATING: N/A
Sold without playing.

Ken:
Purchased on the strength of childhood nostalgia.  Wife uninterested.  Fiddly (particularly compared to other early purchases), and able to be sold for a significant profit.  Quite frankly, blocks and chits appeal more than these sculpts, and present information in a much more player friendly way.

Would be willing to play with the right group.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Kathleen:
I agree - wife was uninterested.  At the time, early in my gaming experience, the game was entirely overwhelming - rules, board, components, et al.  I would describe myself as unsure, now - the theme appeals, as does the gameplay, in theory.  Would probably prefer a smaller version.

Rating is for the Global Version Alpha 3: 

Not fully backed by any means. The rules are a mess and there are silly little things that just strike me as wrong, like the French continuing to fight after Paris falls. 

Naval movement is too fast,and the game is trying to be more than the mechanics allow for. This leads to gamey tactic winning the day. 

I also have a problem with a game where the axis are trying to run wild until the US joins and saves the day. 
IMHO the US and Russia make way too much money at the start of the game.

For me, if I am going to invest as much time and effort as it takes to play the global game, I would rather play something I know works better, like TI3 or Europe Engulfed or World in Flames. 

This is a shame since the anniversary edition plays fine.. this version just is trying to hard to be more than it should.

One of my two favorite A&A editions, alongside the original 2001 A&A Pacific (not the 1940 version). Having the Italians and French in play really adds to the appeal of this game, and as a standalone game it is reasonable in game length. I prefer it alone to the massive 1940 Global game.

RATING: 7
Played linked with Axis and Allies 1940 pacific. 
A little too simple for my tastes. I intend to draft an advanced set of house rules, mostly using World in Flames type ideas (US and Russian entry, Oil resources, factories etc.); this should not be to hard as all the components are already there: Great Area type map; nice  plastic figures, counters for various facilities.
Some of the figures are somewhat too big (i.e. Strategic Bombers) and some of the areas too small for the figures they are likely to contain (i.e. United Kingdom.

Overall a good game for those who like simple games which cover big subjects, but could do with a few more rules to improve the realism.

This is a good game, and many additional elements have been added which has improved the simulation value significantly from previous versions of A&A. Of course that comes at a price (play time) and I feel this game is really pressing the limits of ow large a game it makes sense to contain in the A&A frame work. The game maintains the "fun" factor of the series, but adds a considerable amount of brainburn, which enhances the opportunity to outplay your opponent. This also makes the game somewhat less luck dependent than the older, smaller A&A games.

Make sure to use the 2e rules, which fix a LOT of issues with the 1e.

Europe 1940 version. So far the best A&A variant I know: more diversity through more unit types. Gameplay: It all comes down to the American. The Brit will be isolated on Britain soon, France will have to operate in Africa, Italy will get strong very soon, but stays vulnerable. Russia has to be attacked early! The Allied fleets are incredibly powerful. 

No tech, btw.

Global version is just EPIC. However, it takes 6-10 hours to be played so it's not a game for everybody.

RATING: 7
In my book, the best light-feel wargame there is, however it does drag out and tends to require 12+ hour sessions to complete when combined with the 1940 Pacific set for a A&A 1940 Global experience (the best way to play it).

Very luck based game, dont expect realism here.

Europe also has better production values compared to Pacific, since that was riddled with some rather inexcusable mistakes (wrong battleboard & missing Japanse tac. bomber pieces), therefore I grade Europe a bit higher than Pacific.

Better as A&A Pacific,I just like to play with the Germans and Russians. Still the combat is not very challenging and has not that much strategic dept. It seems that the game was not play tested that much as the OOB setup was unfavorable for the axis. The concept is more arcade then historical accurate as the units have just an attack and defence value and do not at much in the tactical concept.
When I was younger I loved this game, now there are games with just more dept in gameplay and challege, like block wargames.
I hope they will come with a 1939 and more advanced rules.

*** Global rules ***

FUN ★★★★★
I'll give a 5 stars despite some little drawbacks. I^m ok with very long games but this one is very very looooong. Another issue is the fact that URSS and USA players have to wait hours until they really enter into play, depending on how the story unfolds. I think it should be player at 3: one with Axis in Europe, one with Japan and one with the Allies. Otherwise, it's just crazy how good it is to play this game! We were 5 guys and each of us was completly excited with it. A huge success.

RULES ★★★✰✰
The rulebook is the mess, no index, no logics in the chapter, no player aids that would help player during the play. I've written a player aid that contain the sequence of play and units description (in French) that you can download in the game section. I could translate it into French if someone would correct the English mistakes.

IMMERSION ★★★★★
The plastic standing pieces, the variety in unit types, the very large map make this game very immersive. We really feel like generals moving their armies around the globe. It's a unforgettable experience that I recommand to all boardgamers that have some time to dive into it.

DEPTH ★★★★★
At the first glance (only one play), it looks like there are quite a lot of possible strategies snd tactics. We can combine arms, make amphibious assaults, take benefit of the various characteristics of the units. Very deep game, as it looks like at least.

Wouldn't be a bad A&A entry, but it's a bit heavy on the micromanagement side and somewhat bloated, with too much stuff on board that gets in the way of enjoyment. Not a fan of the National Objectives. Global is a majestic sight though, and a reasonably good game too. 

The added realism rules (and cards) I designed for it (AleA) streamline the micromanagement aspects and bring the game to another level, imho, especially when going global.

A&A Europe 1940 is a big improvement over its original Europe game with new pieces and a different map. This is a big hit with my friends. The opening move for the Germans will affect the rest of the game. Either the bad guys will be smiling or exploring other options. No two games have played the same for us.

Axis & Allies is the mack daddy of global domination wargames.  The Europe 1940 and Pacific 1940 bring it to a new level.  The two combined provide an epic experience.  It is not something that you want to bring out every game.  It takes a huge commitment in both space and time and even more importantly a group of friends who share the same love of the game.

Since I rated a 9 for Pacific '40, I will rate Europe the same and see if I will change that score after a couple of plays, solo or combine.

We had fun with this playing it a few times.  I'm still not sure that it's balanced, or if our skill level is just too low.
If you like the old Axis & Allies, this is just as fun and something different.

Too long. After 7h we where far away from the end. Bad thing was that during this 7h not so much happend.

The begining of the game is terrible. The board is completly unclear. There`re to many units or to small fields. You don`t see on what fields the units are standing and what units. Even after 7 hours I didn`t see the difference between a destroyer and a cruiser. Light brown for one side and dark brown for another is a terrible choice for a colour of an army. 

Dwontime. Specially when you have only one army. 

The Germans first move in the game should always be attack France. So you could do this in setup.

Traded away my first edition to a friend and picked up these copies.  Great general fun game.  Not my favorite but if have a good opponent it can be fun.

This game includes neutral countries which can be invaded. There are true neutrals as well as pro-axis and pro-allied neutrals. Mechanized infantry and tactical bombers are included. Mechanized infantry is represented by half-tracks. France (blue) and Italy (brown) have national tokens and dedicated units of their own. The board measures 35 inches wide by 32 inches high (89 x 81 cm).

This game is designed to be joined with Axis & Allies Pacific 1940 to create a six player game on a map measuring 70 inches wide by 32 inches high (178 x 81 cm). This variant of the game is described in the Europe 1940 manual as Axis & Allies Global 1940.

11/05/17 update-fixed a lot of the biggest flaws in all previous editions and added more units for more options. biggest downside if you have several players is that the USA can't do much exciting until war breaks out which I as the Germans always wait till the game forces it. Same for Russia although they don't have to wait nearly as long. If you like A&A revised or 50th anniversary edition you should see this as an improvement.

RATING: 8
Have only played the global version, so comments are based on this game as part of it.  This is the culmination of Axis and Allies in many ways. A&A has gotten more complex as time has worn on, and by now, this package is no longer a simple (if lengthy) intro wargame, but rather a full-fledged mid-level grand strategic game.  It works really well, and it shows that there has been iteration after iteration to perfect this idea.  

There are still a few historical warts, like the Italians being rather ridiculously overpowered, able to blow the UK out of North Africa and the naval and air building ability of the Germans is a bit much, but the strategic choices are there, with National Objectives making for a much more historical game.  Even better, the map has opened up in Russia, and executing Barbarossa for the Germans or repelling it for the Russians is no longer a strategically trivial affair, but requires lots of planning and execution.  Absolutely recommended, even for those who don't like the series.

Not my favorite A&A game. I don't like the victory and some of the chrome. Also I think with the bonuses factions get way too much money making for an entirely too long of a game. I don't think I will play this one again.

I want to be interested in this, but again they dropped the ball on the victory conditions. There is no incentive to play through to the endgame (a thematic and mechanical failure), no time pressure to avoid an economic grind (ooh, I get to leverage a minor economic advantage--is this Risk?), no rationality behind the at-start economies (the Axis are grossly overinflated), and a very long playing time (how many games are flat abandoned after 6+ hours?).

Solution: the VP clock from A&A Pacific (the original one, not the new, dumb 1940 one). It solves all those issues. But it's much harder to develop and balance properly, so instead let's add half-tracks and paratroop rules!  Whee!  What a wasted opportunity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Having pretty much all the A&A games since the original, I have to admit this is an excellent version to own, not just for its own merit but for a smooth interface with the Pacific version.  I like the expanded areas of the Russian front and more sea zones to contend with.  Worth getting if you don't have the original and probably still worth getting if you have the anniversary edition for the huge playing area available.

My comment for this will be the same as my comment for the Pacific version:

Playing the two games together is an experience you won't forget. However, prepare to set aside a couple of days to do it. The setup time alone takes as much as playing other games. I've only been able to do it twice, but if I could get a group together to do it again, I would.

I've only played with Europe separate.
For me, it feels like, because they wanted to stay true to the real war, it feels like strategic options are very limited. It mostly boils down to tactics (i.e. what you have to do is almost given, but 'how' you do it  is still up for debate).

I could see this being better if you combine with the pacific theater.

I'm definitely gonna play this again with the Pacific, but I'm not gonna play it more than 2 times after that. If I want to spend a whole day playing a game, I'd pick TI over this 99 times out of 100.

I admit I not a big Axis & Allies fan, I had the original game and enjoyed when I was younger but as I have age it has lost some of its luster. Then Axis & Allies 1940 came along and I took a new look, yes it still luck based but there are some mechanics for supply, Japan & Germany needing oil, etc... I thought to myself I would give it another try. I was pretty happy I did, while I have several other grand strategy WWII games, this one and Pacific 1940 are easy and fun to play.

Great Variant of the classic, I've only played it together with Pacific 1940, so I can't say much about the Europe only variant. The combined map is just huge, the additional Nations and units bring a lot of chrome and new tactics, but they also increase playtime heavily. And that's the game's largest problem: You'll need at least a whole weekend to play a single game!

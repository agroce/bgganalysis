That is a really hard game to play well, particularly when you look at how "punchy" and fun to use the special effects are. This game is fully and completely a perfect game for me except for a few things. The first nit pick is the fairy art isn't as much for me as Native American mystic art would be. The second nit pick of a stronger nature is the artwork on the goblins and the trolls does not seem to mesh well for me with the animal and flower artwork. The last draw back for me is the tense atmosphere and how bad it hurts to lose. Somehow I care, and it is a somewhat negative experience (not that I lose every time). 

All of those drawbacks leave me with a fairly high rating anyway simply because here finally is a game with animal artwork and tough gameplay. Most of the time you will just have the first thing without the second. A lot of animal themed games feel too family game-ish. 

I value this $20 dollar or less game more than all of Yomi. I value it more than my entire sets of Dominion. It is just a better fit for me. It is what I was looking for and what I wanted. It is loud, to some it could appear a bit trashy and cheap (I made jokes about smelling the cigarette smoke coming off of the cards). I don't know what makes me say that. However, whoa! I do respect it as one of my best games that I own. That cheap and loud and trashy flavor makes me feel more emotionally attached to it.

The gameplay weight does not feel extremely light to me.

It is a solid euro card game. Far less luck dependent than one could think. The theme is a bit childlish but it does not disturb me that much.

Odd sized cards that wear out quickly. But the game is decent. Reminds me a bit of High Society due to money management and of Ra due to the structure of auctions with bombs. A bit longish for what it is maybe and a wee bit out of your control.

RATING: 5
Nothing terrible wrong, but the biggest issue is it's length (which is too much although this is not THAT long but too long compared what you get). AND when you combine that with the fact, that other games makes things much better and smoother... So here we are? Why should I play this instead of such an gold oldies like for example Einfach Tierish/High Society, Ra/Razzia? So no room for Fairy Land!

I'd play again but its another card game I don't need to own. Lots of fairy artwork. Set collection using an set of purchase cards.

Fun set collection + auction game mechanics. I love the animal artwork. The flower artwork is barren in comparison. Not sure why they couldn't use the same illustration style for the flowers and the fairies. Anyway, overall, I'm please that I traded for this game.

A decent set collection card game, with some special power cards thrown in. 

Top notch illustrations, but the non-sleevable card size combined with black borders means that the cards will start showing wear very quickly.

Quel che parrebbe un banale gioco di carte si rivela un interessante gioco di maggioranze con semplici ma efficienti aste. Il gioco si apprende in pochi minuti e può esser giocato da tutti anche se, volendo, offre aspetti strategici. Grazie alla varietà di carte Regina (non tutte verranno utilizzate) il gioco risulta particolarmente longevo. Un giochino semplice ma non banale, simpatico e dalle illustrazioni 'stile Citadels' piacevoli. Curata l'edizione italiano-tedesco che fornisce per tutte le carte con testo una doppia copia che permette di utilizzarle in entrambe le lingue, comode anche le carte con i riepiloghi di punteggio e fasi di gioco. Il gioco lo si può trovare anche a prezzi veramente bassi.

Meh. Not that I have ever been fond of games where you get points from collecting majorities, especially not when combined with a bidding mechanism that makes it hard to ensure that you actually get the resources you need.

1 play, 2er

An interesting little game of auctioning and set collection. Rules are pretty simple, but the once-around nature of the bidding makes turns interesting. Probably better with more players, though.

--- Summary ---
Each player has a set of 7 fairy cards (1-7), and a coat of arms item (place on table). The deck of forest cards (35 animals in different counts; 6 fairy cards with special powers; 25 flowers, 5x5 colors; 14 goblins; some ogre cards; and 1 lost half-pendant) is shuffled; 9 random ones make the "druid" deck, the rest are the "forest" deck. A separate "Queen" deck is formed by taking 9 random Queen cards: these are items with various powers or VP value. Place the top 3 cards of the forest deck into 3 piles ("clearings").

On your turn:
1. Draw the top 2 cards from the forest deck and add them to 2 different clearings. Monster goes to clearing with fewest monsters; if both mosthers, they must go to different clearings.
2. Take ONE action:
- put a clearing up for auction: once around, you bid last; use your fairy cards to bid (sum of values). Winner adds all won fairies into their hand; animals, flowers, and goblins are placed into their personal display. Ogres force you to remove 2 of your animal/flower cards from the game.
- play fairy card(s) with sum n; draw n-1 cards from the Queen deck: choose 1 to place in your display, and place the rest at the bottom of the Queen deck (in any order)
- play fairy card(s) as above, but look in druid deck: card taken is resolved same as if it were from a clearing
- use one of your items; using your coat-of-arms returns all the fairy cards you've bid with to your hand
3. If any clearing(s) have 6 cards, remove those cards from the game.

The game ends at the end of the turn when the forest deck is empty. Players score VP (with specific tiebreakers):
- animals: majority player scores value (= number of those animals in deck)
- flowers: score for having 4 or 5 in a color; also, for having multiple colors
- items: according to item rules
- fairies in hand: player with highest sum gets 3VP
- goblins: player with most goblins loses 2VP per goblin
Most VP wins!

Bidding, set collection.
Use your very limited hand of fairies to collect flowers and animals from the forest and items of great power from the Queen of the Fairies.

2-4 players.

This is not a game I'm usually interested in (set collection) but the art and fairy-theme (in part because my girlfriend might want to play this) made me buy it.

The game quite interesting for a set collection game. The auction mechanism can create some fun moments and the queen cards have some interesting effects

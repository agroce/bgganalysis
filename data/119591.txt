This is similar to 7 wonders in that it has several ways to score victory points and thus allows to choose multiple stategies to try and win the game. The game play was good however the game lacks a compelling theme to make the game really fun.

RATING: 6.5
A typical Eurogame: different ways to make points, seems more or less balanced. Mixes some Elements, works good. In the end game, it may drag a little if people think too long.
Basically a good game with not much to complain about concerning mechanics. Nothing outstading or highly original, though.

Theme is not very well implemented, so the game is lacking atmosphere.

Concerning the equipment, one must say, that the victory point bar is a bit of a failure, hard to read. Also the players personal boards are a bit tiny and thin. We missed also overview cards with possible actions and majority-bonus-effects.
Board and other pieces are good.

The latest Stefan Feld is something of a relief after the sprawling, bulky Bora Bora. Rialto is streamlined, fairly light, and easy to pick up. There is nothing new here - bidding for actions, enhancing your engine with buildings, earning victory points for area-majority. It feels similar to the much-maligned Ming Dynasty, but dryer (not that Ming Dynasty is a barrel of laughs). The components and artwork aren't enough to make Rialto jump off the page, and the theme is non-existent (as with most of Feld's designs). All in all, it feels like a cleverly designed, but unexciting package - all the individual elements of the game have been implemented in more exciting games elsewhere. You can always rely on Mr Feld to put out something "solid" though, and Rialto doesn't let the canon down.

1 play / 3 players

LIKE: I like the mechanisms relating to the area control, the selection of cards and taking actions in a sequence is a great, fun idea. Simple rules, good player interaction.

DISLIKE: Dry theme, but that didn't turn me away. It has a dark board and the point track is difficult to find the correct point spots. In my opinion, the game needs 4 or 5 players to really become competitive, because at 3 I didn't feel the tension.

OVERALL: Great mechanisms but the game is dry and the board is dark. There isn't enough to get excited. Compared to Strasbourg, I feel Strasbourg is a slightly more exciting game, but Rialto is the more competitive one. I wish there was a little more to this game to enrich it, in theme or goals.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Smooth, polished play leads to deceptively easy flow. But this game has some bite. For Feld, it is mild. For regular Euro players, it is a light feast. For me, I enjoy it and will recommend it as my new king of medium/light Euro play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Another solid offering from Feld.  This one plays quicker than most (except maybe for Speicherstadt), but still has deep strategy and interesting decisions, plus multiple paths to victory.  It reminds me just a little bit of In the Year of the Dragon, but I enjoyed this one much more.

I do have a couple of gripes about the game.  It has a few rules exceptions and corner cases that are "inelegant" and probably hard to remember.  And the scoring track is not very clear.  They got fancy with it and made it so that the dividing lines are not clear.  It makes scoring a bit of a hassle.

UPDATE: After a second play, I'm lowering the rating on this one by half a point to a 7.  It's still a solid game, but just doesn't have anything to make it stand out from other similar games.

RATING: 9
Highly underrated.

Not an auction game. Think of it as trying to get controlling interest in the different types of resources each turn as well as the areas on the board.

Only play with 3 (People often play with 4 or 5 which is another reason it is not well liked)

RATING: 9
Rialto is one of my favorite Stefan Feld games. Unlike a lot of his designs, Rialto has a real streamlined architecture. The rules are not simplistic but the are few and the get out of the way nicely.you draft flops of cards all of which correspond to specific types of actions, then bid to take these actions. As the game continues, you attempt to control districts, build buildings into a custome actions tableu which you use to perform special additional actions in order to ultimately gain the most points. Play is frictionless, the game does not overstay its welcome nor does it begin to feel stale. Another Feld I am happy to own.

I like playing this game at the end of a gaming session, as a way to relax. 

It is an inoffensive amusement. 

A rather light and a typical point salad Feld game.

One way to earn points is in area control and I find this interesting as the value of each area can change, adding some tension to a mostly easygoing game.

Replayability feels limited due to similar strategies playing out each time out. Feels like it may get tapped out after 10-15 plays.

RATING: 7
Fun little card/area majority game.  Planning, turn order, and not over-diversifying are the keys to playing the game.  A little AP-prone.  Good overall length, but you never seem to get enough use from your buildings.  Plenty of good decisions to go around for this "light-medium weight" game.

Abstract:
Rialto is a card-driven area-control game all about majorities in Venice by Stefan Feld.

Round overview:
a) Selecting a set of cards and activate green buildings
b) Playing cards, resolve actions, and activate yellow buildings
c) Activate blue buildings

Card overview:
a) Doge: advance on the turn order track.
b) Gold: get gold (to activate owned buildings)
c) Building: acquire a building tile.
d) Bridge: 1 VP for each Bridge card or lose 1 VP for playing no Bridge cards. Bonus: place Bridge tile on the board.
e) Gondola: Take councilmen. Bonus: place gondola tile on the board and one councilman.
f) Councilmen: place councilmen on the board.
g) Joker: wild cards used to increase the amount of played cards (see above) for majority.

Pros:
+ Selecting set of cards is simple but very important: determining strength and weaknesses
+ Adding two random face-down cards to each set of cards creates uncertainty
+ Joker cards add flexibility: when to use a joker or not (push your luck)
+ Players compete for turn order (Doge track): used as tie-breaker - ties are very likely
+ Special majority bonus for the most played cards of a type: small, but important bonus
+ Race for bonus victory points for having at least one councilmen on each district in the north or south
+ The value of the districts is created by the players during the game (by placing bridge and gondola tiles)
+ Restrictive hand size: players cannot do everything
+ Plays well with all player counts (simple dummy player for 2-player games)
+ Well written rules
+ Quick game

Neutrals:
# Theme is okay, but quite abstract
# Buildings grant players special powers and flexibility (all of them are pretty good)
# Some luck: card-driven luck-of-the-draw combined with player order (having first dips on the set of cards)
# Nearly no hidden information except for the face-down cards drawn by each player
# High memory elements, especially at higher player counts: to remember what cards the other players have chosen is important
# Indirect player interaction: selecting set of cards, Doge track for tie-breaking, manipulating the value of districts
# There is no variability other than that cards and bridge tiles come out in different order
# Rather tactical than strategical (long-term elements are: buying buildings for special abilities, keeping cards for the next round, and adjusting the value of districts, getting the bonus victory points for north/south)
# Not hard to teach, but: player order changes very often (plus Doge track on top), many cards and building tiles need to be explained up front (best would be to play one learning round and then reset)
# No take-that
# Scoring happens during the round, between rounds, and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Artwork is okay, very dry, but functional 
- The artwork for the scoring track is counter-intuitive
- Component quality: some uneven colors, thin player boards
- The buildings tiles need to be sorted at set-up (I do not lay out the tiles, instead, I provide three plastic boxes for each color)
- End game scoring requires either rounding up or rounding down (it depends)
- Player order can be confusing (especially on first play)
- Cards need to be shuffled often and thoroughly 
- No player aids

Thoughts:
Rialto is all about majorities: playing the most cards of a type provides an extra bonus and having the most councilmen in a district provides victory points (area-control). There is quite a lot of decision-making necessary when selecting a set of cards and playing these cards (especially the joker card). However, playing cards may not be exciting for everyone (like for me) - it mostly resolves on autopilot. And depending on which set of cards a player got, the available actions may be quite limited (buildings help to mitigate). The special abilities of the buildings are neat, but I wish there would be more variation. What I like most about Rialto are the idea of many mini-auctions and that players create the value of the districts during the game which is a nice twist in this genre. However, Rialto is not as elegant as other games by Stefan Feld. It is one of his "lighter" games that supports up to 5 players.

I admit, going into this, I was not excited to play it.  Overall though, I really enjoyed it.  The quick rounds, the area control, the way the elements come together.  I like the buildings that add different functions to the different phases of the game.  

I have some concerns about replayability (there aren't any variable buildings or player powers or anything like that), so I'm not sure how long this game holds up, but I could see this game sliding into 8 territory if it holds up.

Na ja. Aus meiner Sicht hat das Spiel zwei Probleme. Es ist von Stefan Feld, deshalb hat man hohe Erwartungen, die das doch sehr "mechanische" Spiel nicht wirklich erfüllt. Zudem hat es mit seinem Thema -hat es überhaupt eines?- so gut wie nichts zu tun. Ein Mehrheitenspiel, dessen Mechnismen ein Thema aufgepfropft worden ist. Wenn man das Thema schon so eng fasst, Rialto ist gerade mal eine einzige Brücke in Venedig, dann erkennt man auch sofort, dass das Thema aufgesetzt ist. Bloß weil die Wertigkeiten von Mehrheiten letztlich davon abhängen, wie die sechs Brücken und die sechs Gondeln zwischen die Stadtteile als Verbindung gelegt werden, kommt keinerlei Venedig-Feeling auf. Allenfalls löst das Spiel den Reiz aus, ältere Spiele, die auf das Thema Venedig setzen (Doge, Marco Polo), hervorzukramen. Ist es denn wirklich für einen erfahrenen Autor so schwer, eine vernünftige Verbindung zwischen einem Thema und dazu passenden Mechanismen herzustellen? Das hier ist jedenfalls aus meiner Sicht bestenfalls trockener Denksport, Spielspaß empfinde ich dabei nicht.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rialto centres on a card draft at the start of each turn.  Having drafted and drawn a hand of cards, we then play them to bid for control of various actions during the turn.  Of course, we'd all like to do every action, so there is a strong element of prioritization in the draft. And this is about as interesting as this game gets. The draft itself is very straightforward, with players picking sets of cards in turn order.  

Feld takes a different approach to area control, with the control of one area on the board determined each turn and scant opportunity to alter it in later turns.  Instead, we battle over what an area will be worth.  That's OK, but it does lend the game a rather static, incremental feel, particularly when the inevitable comparisons are made with Moon and Weissblum's very fluid and dramatic treatment of area control in Venice.

Production quality and artwork are both good.

A pleasant, card driven, majority chasing euro, though perhaps not entirely exciting in its overall play. Where was the excitement in the game again?  In choosing the cards, deciding which cards to apply your wild cards to, and jumping up in turn order.  Fair enough.  

I felt like the theme of this game was both there, and not there.  It is set in Venice, and the art seemed appropriately done, including the board I guess.  Yet, nothing "felt" thematic as I was playing it, a strange, though perhaps Feldian result.  Still, in the final analysis, I kind have a soft spot for this basic little euro.  Giving it a 7 of 10.  September 2016.

On second play, I guess this Feld design is fun enough, in a mellow way, particularly with five players, that I will raise it to an 8.

Another Euro set in Venice, - how original! I enjoyed this much more than the last Feld game I played (Macao). The mechanics (a mixture of once round auction, card drafting, area control and jockeying for turn order) gel together and flow seamlessly, and the game was engaging rather than a chore in spite of a longish 2 hour first game with 5 players. 

Component quality is good and the styling (in the usual Feldian pastel shades) is adequate but dull - the points track as others have noted, is poor. 

I hear there is a not bad 2 player variant which means I might consider picking this up at some point.

Another game that would be fantastic at 45 minutes, shame it lasted 110.  San Marco without the cake-slicing.  Full of tough decisions.  Played with a timer, I could really enjoy this one.  Many of the points come at the end, so tricky to see who is really leading.

The components are great, except for the unfortunate scoring track. It certainly my favourite Feld game. My biggest problem with the game it's how fixed the area majorities can become, a big problem for a pure area majority game like this one.

Úgy tűnt, Feld nem is próbálta takargatni, hogy a San Marco ihlette... ezért nem is zavart a nagy hasonlóság. Nem olvastam utána, de gondolom egyik régi kedvence lehet. A játék szerintem nagyon jól eltalált! Ha már a San Marcohoz hasonlítom: itt ami nagy plusz az elődhöz képest, az az épületek (nagyon ötletes némelyik), amik szerintem feldobják, emiatt a Rialto kicsit mélyebb, komolyabb (bár ez nem is olyan egyértelmű, mert az elődöt meg épp a kártyák szétosztása teszi nehézzé, az itt kimaradt, helyette automatikus a dolog). Aki szabállyal együtt 1-2 órás jó játékra vágyik, amin azért lehet agyalni, de nem vészesen bonyolult, annak ezt  bátran ajánlanám, akárcsak a legtöbb Feldet.
Strasburgra nem emlékszem, de állítólag arra is hasonlít.

Egy elég nagy hiba: a pontozósáv KATASZTROFÁLIS!!

Fantastic "double majority" game.  By playing cards, you get people in districts, which will give you points on a majority system.  By playing cards, you get some other things, and the one with the majority in each kind will receive a valuable bonus.  Great point is that the value of the districts is not predefined, but the players decide through the game.
A new medium weight game from Feld (in a weight similar to Die Speicherstadt) with very nice playing options.  It seems to have different ways to approach to victory.  Nice production, good materials.

Rialto is the less "feldian" game designed by Stefan Feld I played (and I am quite a fan, beware).

First of all, it doesn't seem like a "point salad": the main way to score points (at least with few players) is by gaining majorities in each of the six quarters, then there's a fistful of points for building buildings and some more obtained by actions (bridges) and building activation.

Second point: the game is lighter than any other game by Feld I ever played (with the exception of Speicherstadt)... There are some interlocking mechanics, but everything is very straightforward and less convoluted than the usual feldian way!

The core mechanic, by the way, is card drafting: players draft groups of six cards and add a couple from the top of the deck (and some more if the control and activate some buildings) to form their hands. Then play cards to obtain various thing (better placement in turn order/tie-breaker track, money, more pieces, etc.), with the player that plays the most of a type of cards obtaining a bonus.

The draft part is nice, and there's some necessity of managing the timing and the turn order (the "winner" of the previous bonus plays first in the next).

Everything is quite enjoyable, even if not groundbreaking or memorable.

A minor complaint about the production: Pegasus is used to better standards... the board art is a little bland, and the point track is barely readable!

RATING: 7
Area control game with actions being won through card bidding auctions. The doge track heavily influences whether or not you will have the cards in hand that you want, since columns of cards (to comprise a hand) are selected based on doge priority. If you aren't going to compete on the doge track it is extremely important that your strategy & timing be asynchronous with everyone else. The doge track also decides all tie-breakers, which allows the leader to operate more efficiently since he/she isn't worried about auction ties.

Some similarities to San Marco are obvious if you've played that game (area control, cards, bridges, etc.), but I think I prefer a 3-player game of San Marco due to the painful process of deciding how to best allocate the cards. Rialto's random distribution into columns works too though. 

Auction games improve when those playing the game fully understand the value of the auction. I would expect this game to improve with repeated plays, but my gaming friends prefer to play a wide variety of games -- which means I will likely never see this game reach its full potential. I am content to play someone else's copy of this game.

First Play 25-4-13: Quick to explain although some fiddly rules need to be grasped before kick off. An understanding of the buildings is crucial too.

The game licks along at a pace with few if any long decisions once the cards are selected. Final scores were quite close with various strategies chasing buildings vs area majority. 

A solid 7.5 which isn't enough for me to buy considering my heaving collection but I might trade for.

One of Field best games. Rialto reminds me of a Notre Dame meets San Marco. I highly recommend this game over other more fiddly games bye the same designer.

A lighter, different Feld than we are used to.  This area control-majority influence game pits players against each other to control the areas of Venice through leveraging buildings, bridges, gondolas, and councilman with limited coinage to gain majorities which award players at every stage of the game.  (I probably plays better with more people, a little flat after a few plays of 2p).

Comparing Rialto to Taj Mahal (from a geeklist comment I made):

It (Rialto) definitely ends up feeling quite different while playing but here are some similarities:

1. the obvious- the random setup in which areas are resolved in a different order each game. 

2. you "visit" a new region each round of card play- players vie for control of the region before moving on to the next one. 1+2 are sort of the same, but the spacial element feels similar. In Taj you're planning strategically which areas you are going to attempt to dominate before the game even starts- that's sort of present here as well.

3. Rather than the cards having all assets spread amongs the different suits and bidding for everything all in one big round- Rialto is more compartmentalized. Each "gift" is auctioned off separately with players bidding cards in suits that only win them that particular item. It would be like in Taj if the structure was "first we go around to decide who wins the elephants, then we'll go around for the green lady and so on...

4. (IN Rialto) The spacial considerations involving the networking of your assets is supplanted by a weaker, but still important, one-off goal of being the first person with your men in each of 3 regions. This is the closest analogue to the networking of Taj. 

Rialto is lighter, more focused on card drafting rather than bidding. It's absolutely different- depth, playtime, strat vs tactics- but after playing Rialto I couldn't help but think Taj was an influence- even if only at the most general level.

Another Stefan Feld game that is lost in the multitude of other games similar to this one. The game has some engaging decisions to be made, but nothing particularly noteworthy.

Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable quick playing game a couple of notches under some of his other more notable titles like Trajan, Castles of Burgundy and Bora Bora.

This was a huge positive surprise. I had heard other Feld fans talk about this being a so-so release, when I saw the review videos it didn't look all that exciting and the board isn't exactly great looking, but this was very very enjoyable. I really liked both the card play aspect and the rather intriguing take on area control. So chalk this up as another win for Stefan Feld in my book.

This game is incredible. With 4-5 players the tension is through the roof! In typical Feld fashion, every decision is a good decision, and you want it all, but you can't have it. This game actually has us yelling more than The Resistance!


[i]Edit:  Adding some thoughts based on a reply I wrote for a review of Rialto on the forums[/i]: 

This is one of my absolute favorite Feld games. I think the nuances really present themselves more clearly with each subsequent play. The gameplay does not vary turn to turn, but your strategy for the turn absolutely must. You should make a choice each round as to which category majorities you want to win and which you are willing to give up. Then you have the tension of trying to read what your opponents want and make it happen. It's so deliciously tense! You might focus all your attention on winning the gondola category just so you can win the bonus to sneak a councilman into the last blue area to nab you the extra 5 points as the first player to place in each blue area. Or you might focus all your efforts to try and win out the bridge bonus to get the ability to place that 6 point bridge in an area where earlier in the game you positioned yourself with the most councilmen. But to do that, you need to make sure you've got enough coins in play to activate your yellow building as a wild card to boost your bridge card total! So each decision is agonizing and entirely depends on what your opponents do and positioning on the doge track.

RATING: N/A
This isn't a bad area majority game.  I like some of the balancing mechanisms and how the scoring for the game unfolds based on player actions.  The Doge track is extremely important... more so than the "Feld wall" is in other games of his.  However, I wasn't enamored with how it worked.  El Grande and San Marco feel like superior area majority games to me.  I'll probably try it again, but I am not overwhelmed with excitement to play this again.

The scoring track in this game is the worst I've ever seen.  With all of the playtesting done for game designs, I can't comprehend why there is no playtesting done with the artistic design of the game.

Interesting area control game with a nice use of cards.

I obviously like it, given the rating, but I also can't shake the feeling that it would have been better either being pared down into a lighter game or fleshed out into a heavier game -- some of the mechanics feel a little disjointed.

Good game, quite heavy despite its sub-hour playing time. Classic Feld balancing of several ways to score and a turn order track which is crucial in tie-breaking too. Very neat, I enjoyed it.

*update* First play was with 3, after a 2nd play, 5p I am going to bring my rating down. It was good with 3 but way too chaotic with 5.

The more I think about it, the more I like this one.  It reminds me of Macao only with the randomness of the cards (similar to the dice) in that you have to work with what is available.  You want the better choice, move up so you get an earlier pick.  I think the second play of this is going to be quite awesome.  It's an interesting take on area control.

Sept 2014 - Why didn't I mention two of the games that seemed to inspire it, San Marco (look, bridges, area control) and Industrial Waste (card selection).  After my third play, rating stays the same.  Having a plan on what you want to do ahead of time really helps in this one.  With the buildings, you can mitigate the randomness of the cards that come out.  Some of the strategy can be subtle (knowing you will focus on certain areas so trying to sabotage the point total in others you will ignore).  Solid 8.  For me, I like this better than Trajan and Bora Bora of Feld's games (I'm a Feld fanboy).

I would consider this a great entry point into FELD games.

The mechanics are all there...game flow is smooth...easy to explain to a casual gamer, yet enough meat in there to keep a serious gamer thinking.

Plus, it's five player Feld game that you can finish in 60-90 mins.  (I think the extra time I spent was due to the rules reading and learning)

All five players liked the game! :-)

2013. S.Feld. auctions and area control... two of my least favorite genres if they are not masked, tempered or interwoven with other more appealing mechanics.

Others say: Possibly flawed by an optimal strategy thus lacking multiple paths to victory (see Larry Chong's comment).  Has similarities to San Marco and Taj Mahal. Sounds like regions become important randomly like in Taj Mahal.  Auction method is rumored to be clever but supposedly the game involves too many auctions.

Venice at dawn is not very beautiful at all. That you can get 3 buildings and use them, all of the same kind can lead to a very unbalanced game. Remember the big advantage to be 1st or 2nd on the Doge-track and to hold +2 or +4 cards at your hand with 2 or 3 green buildings? You will get overflown by many Action cards and later the resulting Boni! 
Rialto will be played once more in a 3 or 4 player game, just to proof that theory.

Love it. It has easy to learn rules, and very simple gameplay, but also provides tough decisions to make on every turn. Being first player is often crucial because it allows you to win ties, but can be a huge disadvantage because you are forced to play your cards before everyone else. The game weirdly reminds me of Puerto Rico in its elegance, simplicity, and interesting player interactions. The hand selection phase at the beginning of the round is a really tricky part of the game (similar to the action auction in Nieuw Amsterdam), and will shape dramatically how you play each round.

This design really feels like a throwback to the old area majority games from the late 90's, and I'd never have thought it was a Feld design.  Not that this is a bad thing, but I was just surprised at the type of game it was!

The twist to Rialto is that it's an area majority game, but players have to bid cards to do everything in the game.  You'll be building buildings (which give you special abilities and are worth points), building bridges (which effect how many points each of the 6 regions are worth), earning money (to activate the buildings), jockeying for turn order, putting guys into your available pool, and placing guys in your available pool onto the board.  You only have a 7 card hand to do all of this, so the choice is what actions you should focus on in the current round, since you can't do everything (at least not well).

Overall, a good throwback to an older genre of game design, with some neat twists to it that make it unique.

Seems like there is only one viable strategy with the hand limit cards. If you fall behind in cards, there is nasty runaway leader problem. By turn two or three, it is pretty easy to figure the one or two players who can win.

Probably my favorite thing about it is that even when you're not doing well, at least you're getting something for each of your cards. You may not win the bonus, but you don't feeling like you're doing nothing.
Some in our group think the Green 4 is the only way to go. I'm hoping someone smarter and more dedicated than me will show that there are alternatives.

RATING: 7
Rialto is a pretty neat area majority game set in Venice (San Marco, anyone?!). However, the area majority part of the game is actually the “worst” thing about the game, which is kind of weird and a little sad… The main reason is that it’s extremely difficult to get new tokens into city areas where the doge has already visited! So, you kind of play 6 rounds, and in each round you need to some pieces into that current city area as it’s going to be very hard to do later. You need a gondola, but then you’ll only get a single token into that district which hardly ever wins anything except for maybe a few points if you’re lucky. It felt (…) as if it wasn’t a real area majority game, but that the area majority only gave you some points at the end of the game (in our game probably about half of the points we got throughout the game).

What makes Rialto a good game is the card mechanic! I love how some bunches of cards are available at the start of the round and then you pick a row in player order (but still draws some randomly so you never know exactly which cards your opponents have; which is necessary as you get a bonus for playing the majority of cards each round). I like that the cards are played in phases and that you start the next phase if you win the previous one (i.e. get the bonus). This means that you rarely win a lot of phases in a row as you need to say how many cards you want to play before the next player decides etc., and you can (perhaps) keep a few cards for the next round in order to do better then. In general, the limited amount of cards you get each round means that you have to focus on a few major things each round – you can never do everything you want, which is always something I love in games as it’s frustrating in a good way!

The buildings are very cool, although we feel that some of the buildings are certainly better than others. Maybe it’s groupthink, but judging by what other people think, it seems we’re not in the minority… Still, all of the buildings have their uses in different circumstances and I always love when players can do something which other players can’t (well, some other players can’t as there are more of the same type of building. Also, I like the idea that you can upgrade your buildings to better ones!

It works as a 3p game but is more interesting with 4 players. I haven’t tried 5, but I would expect it to work quite well (probably best?). The downtime isn’t as problematic as some say; it’s mostly in the beginning of each round when you choose your cards that you need to think a lot. All in all it’s a good but not great game.

Unfortunately this game has dropped quickly in rating after more plays because the strategy to winning is getting repetitive. I like that it plays well with 2-5 players without too many rules.

Well it's a nice and quick Feld that is for sure. I could definitely see this going in under an hour once everyone understood the rules and how parts A-F work in Phase 2. I do wish there was a player aid or something for this, as I feel like we had to check for bonuses each time.  Overall I enjoyed the game because it did play quickly, but having already played Bruges and enjoying that as a quick Feld game I would almost always reach for that instead.

I also hate tiny cards when you need to hold them in your hand all of the time. If they are laying on the table that's one thing, but small cards always come across as cheap to me.

---
Maybe 7 is a bit generous, I don't know. This feels a bit like the "easy listening" of boardgames. While slightly more complex than say Ticket To Ride, it's pretty smooth, and pretty standard. Basic area control using cubes in Venice? Check. There are 6 rounds where each round one of the 6 regions on the board is the active regions (where dudes can be placed), and there's one major decision per turn: which pile of cards to take. Cards simply have icons corresponding to the six different actions. More of a given icon means you can do more of that action (i.e. get gold, get dudes from supply, put dudes from supply onto current region, etc). After you choose your cards, the round largely plays itself. There are a couple decisions like how to use jokers, and if you play the most of a couple different icons, there are bonuses which require decisions. But I never really felt like there were any really hard or interesting decisions. Which is fine, not all games have to have that, but it's pretty light for a Feld. Maybe on par with Spiecher (which I didn't like; I like Rialto more). It's a perfectly fine game, but with so many games available now, it's hard to find something so great about this game to recommend it above many others. I probably would have passed on it if I played it before buying.

It gets a 8, Castles of Burgundy is much better. The problem here is not being able to rate/rank a game within what it is or its class to be fair. This game is simpler, a lot lighter and plays in a much shorter time then Castles of Burgundy. It is more like the card game of Castles of Burgundy in feel. I would rate it a 10 within its class, a 9 would not be unfair outside it. As it is getting an 8, a 7 would do comparing it with all games. If you are in the mood for a less demanding, good game, then this is it. The problem anyone might have with it is its release, it should have been Rialto, Castles of Burgundy, Bora Bora. That way you would get that feeling of increase in game play and be OK with it. Some people underlining whining in reviews of the game comes from this. They want more, bigger, more grand.  

Take the game Bora Bora. Bora Bora seems like a little too much of a good thing over Castles of Burgundy in both game play and time. Castles of Burgundy would seem lame to a hardcore Bora Bora Fanboy if BB had come out first. 

You do feel the family relationship between the three games and when put in the proper order all three are fine games within their ilk.

Rialto is a solid game.  There are a lot of things to distract you from the end game scoring.  You can not do everything you will want to but if is not that frustrating.  The key is that you do not need to do everything you want to.  The rules are light but there are still tough choices to be made.  I also like the way the rounds are broken down.

Nice game - fills a good space for a Euro for me - plays in about 60-75 mins, has a good slice of tactics/strategy but is not so heavy you have to be thinking all of the time. Great setting/theme and bits (the cards are nice) although the score track is rubbish - around the outside of the board, which is always daft as far as I'm concerned, and the spaces are a bit obscure.

Good for gamers and non-gamers.

A lighter Feld that has some similar elements to Strasbourg in the way cards are bid.   The game hinges on the 6-zone map and some other El-Grande-like mechanisms.   The area scoring is the most important, but the values of the regions are slowly evolved as players place bridges to affect it.   Pretty quick and simple,  once you've played a round.   Probably don't need to own it, but would be happy to play it a few more times.

Absolutely superb Feld game.  A little lighter than some of his real brain-burners but that is no bad thing.  Make no mistake, this is a great game and by no means a light game and there are many decisions to be made at every turn.  Also there are still various routes to victory: buildings, majorities, bridge/gondola VPs, all equally valid paths.  Our one game to date was close yet all 3 players were heading down completely different paths.  

And for a Feld game there is surprisingly continual interactivity, this isn't a solitaire excerise.

It won't drain your head in a Bora Bora fashion, but you'll have plenty to think about and the time will fly by.  

But it does make San Marco redundant - that pales in comparison whilst being similar in mechanic and theme(card selection, area majority, Venice).

Feld continues to ride this extraordinary peak in his creativity and output.  Long may it continue.

Very underrated Feld.  I played the 2-player variant with the neutral player and the game feels incredibly balanced and tense.  Easy to learn but very tough decisions.  The best area control game I've ever played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Worker placement over six rounds, driven by a mix of drafted and random card draws. Every turn counts, but there's a high degree of screwage possible with various actions. Works really well with 2 player rules as well as five, although the spread of cards to choose from with 5 is a bit intense. It can be tough to understand the differences between gondolas and bridges, making it difficult to understand where the most points lay until the game is all but finished. Overall, a very fun game of tough decisions, with a bit of intuition of what your opponents will play.

45-60m, 2-4 players. 5+ plays.

New, shorter game from Feld. Tactical feel remains, no dice, no tons of little tiles. A fresh area control experience. 

2nd play--> A little disappointed in the game. Maybe a little too long and complicated for what it's worth.

Some aspects are similar to San Marco .... but you can play with 2 players.  We played without the dummy player and there was a much larger gap in the score vs with it.   This game could play relatively quickly if you don't overthink the choices.  [Sleeves:  Mayday 100 pack 45mm x 68mm fit well]

Have now played with 2, 3, and 4 players several times each.  Game moves along relatively quickly once everyone knows the routine.  The more players you have, the more relevant the Doge track becomes.

RATING: 8
An area control game in which players have to balance various means of gaining points, with several strategies available.

So far, so dry.

What I really enjoyed about this game was how well the mechanics fit the theme (though I did feel that the 'gondola' card should really be a 'traghetto', but let's not quibble).  Progessing up the 'Doge' track, collecting gold, building buildings in which gold could be traded for advantage, building bridges and settling areas pulled me into the game.

Weighing up all the various options put me in more AP than I'd have liked - I didn't enjoy that aspect of it, so not sure I'd want to buy it on the basis of one game.  I did enjoy the theme though so would be interested to see whether I found the mechanics more comfortable on a second or third play.

Stefan Feld does light-medium area control.  Love the use of majority bonuses in playing cards, and the abilities offered by the buildings.  

See my comprehensive pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1033681

Okay with 2 players, better with 3 or 4, although it's good as a two player game with the advanced variant using a dummy player.  Count on 15-20 minutes a player, and more the first couple of plays.

1 play - 6: not bad, but not as much meat to it as i'd like.  The starting player feels too influential - not that it determines the winner, but that you are constantly annoyed that he's breaking ties on auctions and such.

RATING: 6.5
A perfectly reasonable lightweight offering that features action drafting via stacks of 6 action cards that each player selects and bonus tiles they purchase. After that, it’s using your actions and tiles effectively to put pieces on a map and score for area majority. Pretty simple, but reasonably enjoyable as an appetizer or evening ender. It’s a typical Feld game in that there’s a lot to think about while you’re playing, but there’s not much to think about in between plays. He seems to specialize in games with lots of moving parts that demand a lot of mental juggling but don’t inspire any thought of strategy between plays.

Much cleaner than what I think of as Feld's current-day standard.  My favorite of his designs since In the Year of the Dragon.  Reminds me of Saint Petersburg in a way, in that there's luck in the card draws, but there's skill as well.

A nice enough game, but evidently cobbled together from other Euros. It felt lifeless and standard, but that might have been as much the graphic design.

The majority scoring and card selection was from San Marco and others. The bringing pieces to your yard before deploying was from El Grande. The bonus action for playing most cards was from Palais Royale. 

The only actual original part was the placement of bridges to affect the scoring worth of the sectors of Venice. Other than that, standard fare.

Nada demais.
De 2013, por Stefan Feld, pela Ludonova, Pegasus e TMG.
Disponibilidade em várias lojas por aproximadamente $35.
Principal característica é ser um jogo do Feld. Curiosamente, não parece um jogo do Feld. É praticamente uma re-implementação do San Marco (2001) mas com algumas novas regras que deixam o jogo bem mais estratégico.
Tem um pouco de controle de área no final da partida mas na verdade é um seleção de papeis (ações) com gerenciamento das cartas da mão.
Ponto alto do jogo é escolher as colunas de cartas de ação que você usará na rodada.
Como qualquer jogo do Feld, está um pouco em evidência mas acredito que vai diminuir muito.

RATING: 6
An area majority game set in Venice? Hm, could be I've seen that before somewhere... Gameplay in Rialto is similarly innovative even though it is suprisingly streamlined for a Feld game. Nevertheless, there is some typically Feldian fluff. The buildings, in particular, mostly serve to complicate matters and add more "stuff" without much of a positive impact on the game.

Considering that Rialto is mostly about drafting cards and then using those cards for their predetermined functions (sound familiar?) the drafting mechanism is disappointing, mostly determined simply by turn order and with little opportunity for actual hand management.

There's nothing new under the sun, and even less in Venice.

A quick and easy area majority game. With fewer AP moments and take that moments then other area majority games. 

You can buy buildings that improve how many cards you get and that gives the game a bit of an arch with more cards and options in the end. But not that much really. 

I know I take lots of risks and are bound to get unlucky, but in this game luck is a rather big part. 

You draw cards and place to do things. If you really need cards of a type but do not get them you can sacrify 2 jokers to play one card of the type. If you have a card of the type you can use a joker as another. So if I get one and have 2 jokers I can play 3. If I dont get one and only have the 2 jokers I can play 1. That can really screw you over. 

Worse then that though is how little control you have of what you do. You get 8 cards per round and keep 7. The 7 you can usually only do one thing with only jokers can be used to add more cards of a type but getting majority of a card type give a bonus and getting that or any cards of a type is not under your control. If you pay to go first in turn order you can choose between sets of 6 cards so you have some options there, but that is far from having control and only for some players. 

Way too much lets play and see what happens for me.

Another great game from this designer that does not feel like any other of his games.  While everyone says his themes are merely veneer, I don't find them any thinner than most of the games that I have and the balance of all the actions and the divergent strategies supported is always so spot on.  So hard not to be a fan.  Really. I am trying not to be.  Seems futile.  This one was supposed to be bad.  It isn't and it plays quick with meaty fun decisions and different than any other.  Really nice.

Lighter Feld, slightly easier that Castles of Burgundy, should play shorter.  Reminds me a lot of San Marco, with the setting and bridges and occupying areas, and Augberg 1520 or Asara with the card-play, but is its own game.  Well organised, nice pieces, always more that you want to do than the cards allow.

RATING: 7
Area control/worker placement/set collection/turn order manipulation. The game operates in 3 phases over six turns - planning is required between phases and turns in order to maximise your efficiency and get the correct resourses to maximise your victory points. Points are on offer in a lot of ways both within game and game end, and there is some opportunity to engine build. Luck impacts the deal of the action card sets. 

Rules are clear and easy to get into although this may also indicate some limited replayability - this is a light game. All the bits are very good. Good.

Rialto was published in the same year as Bruges, Amerigo, and Bora Bora, so it's no wonder this is one of the lesser talked about Felds. Which is a shame because in a basic sense Rialto distills many of Feld's mechanics into their most basic forms. A turn order track, card play (with jokers!), punishment criteria, engine building, and needing to do a little bit of everything but not quite being able to do it all. Add to that a hotly contested area majority mechanic and, as quick as you can say "That's amore!", you have a lovely, light-weight Euro.

Opinion: for me is an improvement of San Marco, as I prefer how cards are placed and chosen in this one. Instead of letting one player to do the selection, here is done randomly. Could be a bad point, but with this length and complexity is ok. The rest of the game is quite similar, choose one of the files with cards and execute them depending on the phase they belong to

I like the different options available in this game.  You want to specialize in particular strategies, but you can't completely ignore the others.  

I'm a bit worried that the Doge track might be too important in the end game.  A recent play was decided by the tie breaker for scoring regions.  Massive numbers of points depended upon which players moved first on the doge track during the activation of buildings in round 4.

If this is a problem in future plays, I could see my opinion of Rialto suffering.  If not, I will continue to enjoy and play this clever area control game.

At first glance I would have said this is on the lighter scale of Feld game, closer to the weight of Notre Dame. Now after the very first game you will see there is a surprising amount of depth to be found here. Ever phase of the game is important but you can not possible do them all well, so figuring out what must take precedence and when is the challenge the game presents to the players. I will also say this is one of the more aggressive and confrontational of the Feld games, ever aspect every round there is Top dog so to speak and there is a area control aspect to the game. All in all I am happy with this game and cant wait to get it to the table some more.

One play: A relatively sharp-edged Feld (no crazy action chains) but a little bland. I wonder if there's some Knizia game with this concept (everybody plays some cards of X color, whoever plays the most gets a bonus) that does the same thing with fewer interlocked systems? Would I like that? Do I need to keep this many Feld games, if I like them but am never going to play the less exciting half of them? Confusing.

RATING: 6
It has the usual abstractness and mishmash of mechanics that is expected from Feld, but it's a fine medium-weight game. Your choices are quite limited by the card hands you draft, although jokers and some special buildings can give you a bit more freedom.

My biggest complaint is that too much depends on the doge track, as it determines the order for choosing a set of cards every round and breaks all ties. Every action type gives a bonus to the player who played most cards, but this number is usually small and ties are very frequent. However, I won my first game even falling behind and practically ignoring that track for the whole game, so I suppose it's not [i]too[/i] important.

The production quality is pretty standard, but the art and graphic design could have been better. The score track is atrocious.

Very bad game. You need a little knowledge of were the points are located, which buildings to have, etc. And then luck (in the drawing of cards) will make the difference in gameplay.

The strategic of this game is very simple and clear. Buy buildings that allow you to have more cards (+2, +1) or buildings that allows you to transform one card in two other cards. With this strategy you can turn the luck more in your favour. You draw more cards, you keep more cards, etc. And win this game at ease.

If found its play very simple and frustrating. It's not a strategic worker placement game, where you can plan ahead your moves. Which materials you want, which moves to make (to get these elements). Everything you can earn in this game, depends on the strength of your bidding cards (like Augsburg).

Do you have more luck in the drawing of these extra cards ? Can you keep more cards than other player ? Can you get the 5+ points first ? Can you succeed in dividing your workers the most optimal over all the areas ? Etc...

This game is not a brainbreaker.

Rialto is at it's heart an area-control game, with many paths for some alternate points and also some self-control/steering for points earned in each region.

The actions available in the six rounds are card driven, so there is an interesting selection mechanism for these. Ties for most things are driven by a separate priority tracker, so advancement in the Doge track can aid in gathering actions and points, but it does not provide points in and of itself.

Each player has many options, including buildings which require money to drive, but do earn points, and offer some advantages gathering actions, driving Doge status, or just earning additional VP.

Players use Bridges to build up points in Areas, Councillors to capture control of areas, and Gondolas to gain Councillors, to lower points for areas, and to possibly affect the balance for areas.

But the bulk of points are in the areas won and lost, and it may take a little while to work through how subtle choices make the point collection work for players. I think Rialto has a simple face, but it offers many choices and some hidden subtleties that I look forward to discovering with more plays.

Rated a 7 after three plays: while I like the play, some of the randomness of card distribution makes this a little less controllable, a little more luck-based than some other Feld's.

I still like Rialto, but I'm not sure that there's quite enough steerage in the play for hard-core gaming. I think at heart this is probably more of a (German) family game; not a bad thing at all.

(10/08/2014) Comment based on one play.

This is an interesting Feld game, combining the feel of Notre Dame and St. Petersburg, along with the look of San Marco, in a satisfying, smooth and quick playing game, that involves many agonizing decisions!

As always, Feld has some chaotic element to introduce agonizing choices to the players. Each choice will give the player VP in some form, but there are longer term plays that reap bigger VP if the player is willing to wait. The game is played over six turns, each with three phases. There are three types of buildings, each associated with one of the three phases, and there are four kinds of buildings within each type. The buildings get progressively more powerful, but linearly more expensive.

The first phase involves selection of one of several rows of six cards, along with two additional blind cards, and the option to purchase (spending a coin) more and/or increase hand size if one has a green building on their tableau--the hand limit is seven. The green This is done in turn order which is based on the doge track. Every Feld game puts emphasis on fighting for turn order, since a bunch of good stuff is always placed in front of the players, and first player will usually always take the best stuff. Those further behind will have less choice, although they get to see what cards have been taken.

The second phase involves six different sub-phases, or simply "contests" to see who can play the most cards for each sub-phase. There are six types of symbols, plus a wild symbol, where the symbols can only be played during a particular sub-phase--wilds can be played in any sub-phase to boost the number of symbols. Whomever plays the most symbols for that sub-phase will get a bonus. The sub-phases are: 1) Doge, 2) Coins, 3) Buildings, 4) Bridges, 5) Gondolas, and 6) Venetians. Players will in clockwise order play any number of cards with symbols for that sub-phase, much like a trick play in Bridge. Players will get whatever benefit equal to the number of cards played, plus the one who played the most--ties broken by the doge track--gets a bonus. If a player has yellow buildings, he may active them by spending a coin for each. The yellow buildings give a player the ability to "pass" one turn, since going first can be a disadvantage when playing out cards, or to give more advantages in card play.

In the doge sub-phase, players play doge cards, and march up that many spaces along the doge track. The bonus being another step, with ties being broken by who is on top, similar to the turn order mechanism found in Castles of Burgundy and Amerigo. In the coin sub-phase, players collect coins, with the bonus being an extra coin. In the buildings sub-phase, players can a building, which can give a benefit in one of the three phases of each turn. More powerful buildings cost more cards, but the bonus is a player can get a one-more expensive building, or possibly two buildings! In bridges, players get VP for the number of bridge cards played. However, the bonus allows the winner to place a bridge, each with VP values on each end, to connect any two of the six districts of Venice (and the district names are exactly the same as in San Marco). Whomever has the most Venetians in each district will score the value of all the bridges (using the value on the end that touches the district) and gondolas connected to the district, while second place gets half, rounded down, and third place gets half that and so on. Gondolas allow players to move Venetians from a general supply to their own supply, much like in Notre Dame, while a bonus allows the winner to place a gondola on the board to connect any two districts AND place a Venetian on one of them. Playing venetian cards allows players to move Venetians from their personal supply to the current active district (of which there are six, and the active district moves in some randomly determined path set at the beginning of the game). The bonus is adding an extra Venetian to that district. The rub is that if a player is out of Venetians in his personal supply, he may relocate one from some other district. In this manner, the movement of Venetians from one district to another is reminiscent of San Marco, where players will get into pissing contests in each of the six districts, attempting to get a majority.

The third phase involves optionally invoking blue buildings, spending a coin for each. The blue buildings involve improvement in an existing building (upping up a level within a given type), or getting more VP and/or a Venetian from the supply. In this manner, this feels similar to the three building types in St. Petersburg: Green for income/cards, Orange/Yellow for aristocrats/card manipulation, and Blue for VP in both games.

The game moves far more quickly than San Marco, where in San Marco, much of the time is spend in making the offers. In Rialto, players simply play out as many cards as they want during a particular sub-phase. However, since they are limited in hand size, no player is going to win all of the sub-phases all of the time; there will have to be some give and take. Doge cards are important for turn order for card row selection and tie-breaking, especially for the final scoring. Money cards are important to get coins, which are necessary to active the buildings. Buildings give extra flexibility and power, as well as representing VP at the end of the game. Bridges give VP upfront, but also set put the scoring topology for the final scoring. Gondolas are important for moving Venetians from the general supply to the personal supply, while also giving some flexibility in placing a bonus Venetian on the board. Playing venetian cards is important, as it places Venetians from personal supply onto the board and determines who will score the most in each district. Evaluating the relative value of each card row is important, and is dependent on what each player wishes to accomplish that particular turn. However, there are also defensive considerations, as in preventing others from getting key cards, which would allow them to win a particular sub-phase, and the respective bonus.

There are a lot of cards to consider, so this is the chaotic element, and may be overwhelming at first, like any Feld game. However, this is a much easier game to figure out. After that, it is really about outwitting the other players with the right card plays (they don't have to play all of their cards for a given sub-phase), or boosting up with one of the buildings. There's plenty to think about, yet so little time with only six turns. Very meaty play that plays quickly at 45 minutes, and does not overstay its welcome. The fact that it plays five (!) is a welcome plus, given that almost all of Feld's titles only play up to 4, Notre Dame being the only notable exception. It is a solid "8", and is worth having in every gamer's library.

Update (10/17/2014) 2 plays: Played our first 5-player game, and it was a blast. Much more tension than a 3-player game, and more interactions going around. The "skip a turn" building seems more useful at the larger player counts, while the Doge track becomes less important or powerful. Players could concentrate on getting points elsewhere aside from the final district scoring. Still, the district scoring should not be ignored. Great game, and great addition to any gaming library.

I can sort of see the game there, but it's just so boring and fussy for what it is. Plus, it seems impossible to recover from any early setbacks and suffers from runaway leader. First player gets to pick best cards is able to bid for more advantages, then build more to get more advantages, and so on.

An interesting card-driven area majority game set in Venice.  I have seen Anthony dominate this game by building up a killer building engine.  I am not so sure the game has multiple balanced paths to victory.  It also seems quite random to me, much more so than other area majority games I enjoy such as El Grande and Belfort.  I need to play Rialto about three more times before I can pronounce a final verdict, but I will say that it does not appear to qualify as one of Stefan Feld's better games.  It's a less than, but it isn't unworthy of being played.

RATING: 7.75
Traded for Mystery in the Abbey.  A good game that I enjoy a lot.  Combines area control (similar to El Grande) with building points through construction of buildings and resource/money hoarding.  Area control far outweighs other points with the turn order chart screwing that up completely if you don't watch it closely.  Plays up to 5 in under an hour (this by itself makes it special).

I like how there are several things to keep track of here: the main board with an area majority mechanic, the turn order track which can be manipulated, the cards which decide what actions you may take, and the buildings which give you special powers, and yet the game seems simple and fairly streamlined.  My main complaint is that the game is difficult to read, and it is not so clear whether you are making good progress or not - but I'm sure this wouldn't be the case after some more plays.

A decent game but nothing too special.  Also the artwork is bad and the scoring track is a disaster, but this is a minor issue, really.

Buena impresión. En cierto modo parecido al San Marco en el sentido de que se eligen un grupo de cartas que nos permitirán hacer acciones (no se hacen los grupos)

Después de elegir la cartas, se ejecutan una serie de fases (producción de dinero, avanzar, colorar elmentos en el tablero) que se pueden potenciar con edificios propios.

RATING: 6
Rialto is a game that sees Stefan Feld go a bit more tactical than some of his other designs. In typical Feld fashion, gameplay is the focus over theme - but rather than a point salad, the bulk of the game's points come from manipulating turn order and resources to establish value and control of the game's regions. Think of it as a point hamburger with some toppings added for flavor.

It's a fairly light game - and this is where it falls a bit short for me. There are so many times the game limits possibilities - having to pick from set starting hands, having few choices beyond how to play jokers when it comes to playing cards, having extremely limited options in where to deploy council members beyond winning a gondola, and so on.

It's a pleasant game, but it isn't as exciting as it could have been with a little more complexity.

RATING: 7
This is Feld's take on Moon/Weissblum's [gameid=1041] with some Feld twists.  Still have area control, bridges & Doges (but used differently), and cards distributed... but instead of "I divide, you choose 1st" which is the key mechanic in San Marco, cards are randomly split into sets and Feld's usual player order track controls the order of picking (as well as for everything else in the game).  Add in the buildings which is kind of like the usual Feld mechanism of altering the basic rules.

Overall it comes together pretty well.  The winner in our game was the one who focused on the buildings that got you more cards and increased your hand limit and from reading here on BGG it does seem like a common winning strategy... will have to see how it plays when more than one or all players are more balanced in owning those buildings.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2014)

I was pleasantly surprised by Rialto. I expected it to be the worse Feld game from 2013. As it stands, it is my second favorite 2013 Feld game behind Bora Bora.
 
It has simple rules (easy to teach), but the game is not trivial. It has lots of interesting/though decisions (which cards to pick, when/where to spend the cards, which fights to pick, when to activate buildings),  the decisions are not obvious :D, you have to take into account what your opponents are planning and that`s not easy. I also felt the game flows very fast, even with 5 players. There is a lot of luck with the cards, however I feel the luck is not uncontrollable, there is a lot of skill and reactions you can take (buildings), so it doesn’t bother me. A little reminiscent of Strasbourg, another Feld I really like. 

On the bad side, some buildings and bridges peeled off after I punched them (I have the polish edition) :(, the game board and art are ugly and the score track is an epic fail as it confuse the players constantly, the lights should have been the scoring points, not the spaces. The theme is paper thin, as in inexistent. 

Bottom line, I like this area control game and I want to play it again soon. On 2013 Feld put out 4 games and I like them all, however Bora Bora and Rialto are the better ones IMO. Rialto is lighter than most Felds, but it has some hidden depth I would love to explore.

Rialto is the weakest Feld big box game since Name of the Rose. It's an uninspired mediocre hackjob of putting together multiple generic Euro mechanisms. As it's a Feld, it still works alright as a game and the accumulation of mechanisms shouldn't come as a surprise. Nonetheless, his best games Castles of Burgundy, Luna or also the majority of good games like Bora Bora, In the Year of the Dragon, Speicherstadt somehow manage to inspire me and I want to play them again, improve my skills. Rialto just left a void. Give me San Marco anytime instead when I'm looking for a game of Venice, majorities and card management playable in an hour.

Venice themed games are getting tiresome. Of course, as a Feld, the theme is completely pasted on over the main card-choosing mechanic. But here the mechanisms are not convincing enough to produce a compelling game. Worth it for Feld completists, but ultimately it's kind of boring.

A true Feld-fest for Feld-fans. Best described as a Feld-board with a Feld-Bar and a Feld-tableau, with a ton of Feld-bits and several types of Feld-tiles you can add to the Feld-tableau or the Feld-board, and also some Feld-cards. Each of the aforementioned pieces which is prefaced with the word "Feld" allows you score points in at least one way. This is all OK as I am a fan of Stephan Feld's games in general, but if there is one that distills his design philosophy of "300 ways to score points, none of which make sense outside of the game.", this would be it.

As for deciding whether I should buy this game, the score track makes this a no-buy for me.

Had a bad experience with this game, and I will admit it has lowered my rating because of it. The rule book is atrociously vague. The score track attempts to be unique, but is jarring and unnecessary. The game play is good and rewarding, but the buildings in the game are needlessly broken. Some of the phases suffer from a disconnect, due to checking for bonuses. The theme is a great one, but isn't incorporated. There is no catch-up mechanic in this game, and it begs for one. The list goes on and on. The game plays quickly enough (6 rounds) that it somewhat makes up for some of the aforementioned problems. Somewhere there is a great medium-light game in here, I just need someone to guide me through the twisting canals this game has gotten me lost in.

I want to like this, it is after all a Stefan Feld game, but it is a dry game and none of my plays have been fun. I have played 3 times 2 player basic and once 4 player, I wish to play this 3 player before condemning it to the "play every 10 years" pile. In short the game consists of 6 Turns, each turn has 3 phases. In phase 1 you collect cards (boosted by bonuses from buildings you build during the game). In phase 2 you play cards to gain in game benefits, there are 6 suits and each suit is taken in turn, whoever plays the most of a suit gets a small bonus. In phase 3 you can buy extra victory points and promote buildings you have built. The mechanics work and the play is very smooth, I just found it a little dull and in the 4 player version I found myself in last place in the card draw and unable to change that position - always ending up with the worst set of cards. I am hoping that the 3 player version will bring a small fun factor that is missing from the other games, if so it is likely that the advanced 2 player version will also be a greatly improved game.

What looks like a game inspired by San Marco (same setting, area majority, bridges between areas, placement & manipulation of your eurocubes driven by a handful of card types - doge, bridge, cube placement etc. -) is, in the end, a typical but less complex Feld game, with yawn, multiple ways to win (really, the two players with the highest score – a tie – were doing things completely differently; me, only a few points behind, chose a third way), but it’s just… Well, I didn’t find anything memorable (not to mention ‘novel’) in this game. It doesn’t even really have a spatial aspect which seems to me (too) important to me in games nowadays – Bora Bora had a lot more of it. This is not even really a map; the only map-ish feature that this rather abstract and too symmetric connection system has is that you place 4-4 double tiles (bridges/ships) between areas, distributing the points that the areas will be worth in the end of the game. In the end, the many scoring options only make your decisions feel less tense; it’s just a bunch of mechanism ideas thrown together – they certainly work but are a lot less interesting, than, say, in Bora Bora, a game that somehow I start to appreciate more and more despite being a point salad (buffet), admitting it is... enjoyable in some interesting way. Rialto is less so, what's more it just gets increasinly boring, even if it works.

I only played this once and I'm concerned there's an optimal strategy:  Choose hand with most Jesters plus whatever else you are aiming for.  Buy two Green 4 buildings ASAP.  Be 1st on Doge track as often as possible.  Maintain enough gold to play both Green 4 buildings.

I think this game could be streamlined even more and probably be better.  I, personally, think that removing the Doge track or make it less important (such as only tiebreaker for each area for majority scoring) is better.  Also, any time there is a tie for first on cards played, ignore the bonus (no one gets a bonus unless there's one clear 1st place).

RATING: 6
Classic TMG boardgame for me - 6 rating where I am happy that a friend owns it and I can play it from time to time.  I didn't find it interesting enough to own, but there is some depth to the choices - a bit more than I initially expected.  This is definitely a typical Feld point salad game where several different paths lead to points.  The aspect of selecting a row of 6 face up cards is interesting, but more so if you are far enough up in influence to actually have much of a choice.  Buildings lead to some ability to manipulate cards or other choices/actions in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting lighter Feld card-driven Euro.  The area majority element works differently than in most games since placement options are so limited. The building powers interact nicely with the card play without overwhelming the gameplay.  Quick playing time matches the light feel but there are definitely important decision throughout each turn.

In this game there is a card management and area majority.  You acquire cards that have different roles and you can play them in the next round.  There are a number of roles that you have.  You are trying to place control markers in the various districts and build bridges.  

The game was fun, and relatively light, but the rules in the game were awful.  It was almost impossible to figure out how to play the game.  You have to go out to BGG and read the rules clarifications.  

I don't know if I want to play this with someone who does not know how to play.  And in the end, the game was not better than a 6 or 7.

While playing this game, I couldn't resist thinking of other games with similar features.

[thing=1041][/thing] came to mind, but also, [thing=21790][/thing], [thing=120][/thing], [thing=33160][/thing]...
After one play, it's clear that this is not Feld's best game. But it is a rather light majority game, where play order and timing are crucial to win. 
Not bad, but not great either. Since this game was published around the same time as another "semi-light" [person=4958][/person] game [thing=136888][/thing], I  prefer the latter.

Minus: 1 - 5 - 6 - 8 - [-1]

I'm a fan of Stefan Feld as a designer. This is my least favorite Feld game of the ones I've played. It's still a good game. The dummy player in the two-player game works well for the area control portion of the game. I don't like the implementation of the dummy player for the card-play portion. The problem is that if you're playing with a real third player, you can reason out what they might want to do and that influences your strategy. You can't do that with a dummy player card draw because it's completely random.

A good game, but for a game that is rated as 45 minutes, Rialto has a lot of rules to learn. Need to be very precise.  There is a lot going on in this game, between engine building (via the buildings), area control, variable starting order, and tie break order (the Doge track).  I expect it will be better with repeated play (and with not too long between plays). Not really suitable for casual play.

Sitting to the right of the previous winner is a big advantage when playing cards (as you play last), so seating order can have a big impact depending on what strategies you are playing vs those next to you.  If the person to your left keeps winning the round before the one you want to focus on it puts you at a considerable disadvantage.

Good but not great.  San Marco is a much better area control game, with a cleaner mechanic and a greater ability to influence the area control.  Rialto is more about staking one's claim and moving on, with limited ability to influence an area once the doge has passed (can add one guy using a gondola, or a bridge to increase the value of that area).

Liking this less with each successive play. There seems to be a serious runaway leader issue. I'll give this another try, but I think it's headed to the trade pile. A shame, really. I was looking forward to it. 

Update:  I played it again after a 1.5 year hiatus with 5 players.  I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure what I disliked so much about it earlier, but whatever reservations I had about the game seem to have disappeared.

Absolutely hated this for my first 3-4 plays as it looked like it was supposed to be a pure area control game yet didn't play like one. On my most recent play, I stopped being so stubborn and approached it with an open mind. Utilizing the buildings improved the number of strategic options and made the game feel less flat. I see now that you must use the buildings in unison with the cards to win. It is still far from my favorite Feld, but I appreciate enough to not run the other way when it is pulled out.

Like the love child of San Marco and Strasbourg, this game lands in a weird niche. The card management is more finicky than Strasbourg and the area majority is far stricter than San Marcos.

My only plays have been with 2 and 3 players, and it really feels like my kind of game. It's Feld's take on area majority scoring. There's card drafting too, so it feels a bit like San Marco (same area as well). You have limited opportunities to place mans in each area. It's not his usual point salad sort of scoring, which is a nice change.

An unique take on area majority, without a lot of the open conflict that tends to go on in these sorts of games. As much as I enjoy this game, however, it doesn't have much replay value at all. After a few plays I was happy to move on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Many people characterize this game as a mix between a Feld, a Knizia and a traditional euro design and I'm inclined to agree. There is a Feldian point salad, where you have to choose between area control (points in the end), buildings (special abilities and points in the end) or immediate points. There is also an euro/engine aspect, where you have to manage your flow of money and workers (councilmen) to optimize your gameplay. Finally there is a Knizian bidding angle, where the players bid in various categories and where the winner gets an extra bonus.

The game would have benefitted from a player aide. (I constantly had to consult the rules to remember the details of the actions and the building abilities.) The action phase also lacks some tension since you can't save cards for later (like in Taj Mahal) but only mechanically play out your cards. But for a game of 45 minutes, Rialto has managed to cram in a lot of good mechanisms that work well together.

RATING: 7.5
A lighter Feld, kind of similar to Notre Dame and Strasbourg (The feel and the kind of intelligence required). It plays very smoothly and is easy enough for non-gamers, yet offers enough depth for the experienced players. 

One of the flaw of this game is the need to plan ahead which district to target as you can't add more meeples after the respective phase is over. However, planning ahead isn't exactly easy either as you can't control the distribution of cards each round.

Fortunately, the bridge is very important (and a clever feature) at 'salvaging' the points you might have missed. 

Like most other Felds, it's an extremely tactical game with a little mind game going on. The winner is often the one who best guesses at the demand for different items in a time to put himself in a good position.

It's indeed a very decent and enjoyable game, if not a bit unoriginal. You probably don't need this one unless you like Feld a lot.

In this Venice themed game by Stefan Feld, there are 6 rounds. Each round, players may play down cards in each of the 6 phases. If players play the most cards in a phase, they get a bonus in that phase. For instance, if a player puts down the most building cards, they get to construct a building as if they played one extra card. There are 6 districts, which players must compete over for points, with second place getting half, third place gets half of second and so forth.  Players refill their hands with cards from round to round. 

This is a fun game, with very tough decision making. Do you want to win ties by winning the doge? If so, you will have less cards for gold, building or putting down councilman. When do you use your joker cards? I enjoyed the game, and I think it will play different with the number of players. I have only played 3 player, where the area points were more important, but I suspect with 5 player, the building points may determine the victor.  I'm looking forward to more plays.

Unthematic and arbitrary tie to mechanic that was unintuitive and didn't favor strategy. Just lucky card draw and little planning and not fun like most other felds. Many of feld's games still have a close point spread but imo thats because the weight of decisions is not as meaningful with his point salad system and i say this as the second place player via tiebreaker. Also hate the score track and not enough soace in the general supply and initial bridges are arbitrary ish imo.

I only played this once.  I felt like there were a lot of cool ideas in this game, but they came together in kind of a mush.  Good decisions chains were hard to form.  I normally like to end a Euro by thinking about what I could have done better to succeed (or succeed harder) next time, but I couldn't piece together what chain of actions I would need to accomplish that.

RATING: 7
This is an intriguing area control game.  The mechanics that make it run or a bit confusing.  There are piles of cards people will take at the beginning of the round, and depending what cards are in those piles determines the actions you will take this round...barring the joker that will allow you to have some flexibility during the round.

I remember a solid gamer friend of mine having a hard time wrapping his head around this one, so I have not come back, but I am excited to.

There's a bit more to it than first meets the eye, but it plays like a variation of Strasbourg. Well, I guess that's a little unfair.

to Strasbourg. Rialto's a fast, small game that doesn't play terribly Feld-like, in that one method of scoring (area majorities) is so much more effective than every other scoring method (bridges, buildings, etc.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A well designed, card driven majority game, with money, buildings, bridges, gondolas and a doge track (tie breaker) thrown in. The complexity is a bit higher than the depth of the game deserved, but with the playing time of 1-1.5 hours with 4 players it does not overstay its welcome. after a few plays I think this is a very random game, I have not been able to figure out why the actual winner won in any of my games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Relatively simple game that retains many of the [good] features of Feld's games, like multiple paths to victory, etc., but:
-> The rules are simple and easy to teach, making it available even to non gamers.
-> The game is fast, a game with 5 veteran players it can be finished in under 1 hour (the 45 minutes advertised seem a bit optimistic).
-> It is not a brain burner, no AP prone at all.
-> Quite a few of interaction for a Feld game.

On the contra's side
-> The only random element from one game to the other are the cards; you can play more or less the same strategy in all your games; still, cards are a HUGE randomizer and many things will be different, including the outcome.
-> Worst point track ever.
-> Rules could use a better wording.

For the moment being, every time I play, I like it more :-)

[b]Rialto[/b] 

[i][COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR][/i]

[i]My initial impressions of Rialto are pretty mediocre, I found the various mechanisms to be completely disjointed from one another which made playing the game more of a chore than a challenge. 

I know the added "complexity" appeals to some folks, but I prefer a streamlined area control game where I don't have to fight with the game to take the actions I want. My least favorite element of the game was the buildings and since card draw is so important I can't imagine not going for those buildings, especially early on [i](I didn't and paid for it later in the game)[/i]. The whole game felt cluttered and unfocused with all kinds of mechanisms bolted on. There are similar design elements in other Feld games, but in Rialto they all seem to fight against one another and don't come together to offer a cohesive game play experience. 

I will probably play Rialto again because a friend of mine really likes it and who knows maybe my impression of the game will change, but for now Rialto doesn't hold a candle to my favorite Feld games [i](CoB, Luna and Trajan)[/i].[/i]

Cute, little card drafting and hand management game from Stefan Feld. In fact, this game has a lot in common with La Isla: multiple phases with cards dedicated to "upgrading" your basic actions and the real strategy comes in building your Victory Point generator. It's fun without being taxing. Nice, light filler.

Eerily reminiscent of San Marco, same map, same districts, same area majority thing going on, trying to get most people in each district. This is more enjoyable however. It replaces the crappy, time-wasting Solomon division mechanic with an Industrial Waste type pick up of a set of cards each. Then each of the 6 card types are played out in order with whoever plays the most of each type getting a bonus. Tie breaker track cards (a la the Macao wall), gold cards (needed to activate building powers), building cards (get buildings for bonus powers), straight VP cards, cards to get dudes from the court, and cards to get dudes onto the map onto the district numbered whatever this round is numbered - there's 6 rounds, 6 districts. Whoever plays most bridges and most gondolas gets to place out little chits between the districts that will determine how many points each district is worth at the end of the game when points are awarded El Grande style. So it rolls along merrily and it works professionally. The card pile selection can be tricky, and choosing which building powers to get and activate can differentiate players. Otherwise, it's a pretty straightforward get-dudes-out and score-area-majority type game. At least it finishes in under an hour, which is about my tolerance for area majority these days, so the design is smart in that respect. Nothing much new to see though.

This game caught me by surprise. I wasn't expecting much from it and ended up thoroughly enjoying it. Rialto has a great mix of hand management, strategic timing, and area control, with some special power thrown in to mix things up. It is one of Feld's lighter games, which seems to be the sweet spot with Feld for me. My family has enjoyed this one also.

A game that is about Venice, sort of, this is a card drafting game where you draft groups of cards and then try to play them strategically.  Game plays out over 6 turns.. very decent time pacing...there are opportunties for strategic moves late in the game to put yourself in position to win.   Takes one play through to grasp how the payoffs work, and to understand the importance of finishing 1st or 2nd and the tiebreakers.

Kind of a hidden auction game.  Selecting your row of cards and how to best use them each round makes this game what it is.  And then you use them, and have to press your luck in the 'auction' to see who gets the action bonus, and getting that bonus is a big deal in this game!  And selecting which building tiles to purchase/activate is also a fun component, and another thing to think about.  Plenty going on, but you can still play it in a short amount of time (for a Feld!).

A stellar merging of drafting, hand management, once around auctions, area control, and engine building.  There is room for clever play and timing is crucial.  One of the more interesting features of the game is that players determine the values of the districts as the game unfolds. The game feels more like a classic euro (pre 2005) than Feld's other titles.  Some call this "dated", but I call it "better".

RATING: 7
An area control game in Venice in which you get to place bridges?  Sounds like San Marco, but the similarities end there.  Here, each round corresponds to a section of the city, and players compete to place their cubes in that section.  Additionally, one bridge and one gondola is placed in each round, which help determine what each section of the city is worth.  While the cards that allow you to do these things are drafted in randomly-arranged lots, there are quite a few buildings (techs?) that grant you hand-manipulation powers that can make your hand larger or more lopsided.  All in all, this is a fairly clever game, but it didn't really have anything that made it great.

As much I figured I might enjoy this one, I just found it very "meh". I could see some clever play in it, but I feel like I might see all there is to see after a few games of this one. I'd play it again if asked, and I wouldn't mind trying this with 4-5 players, but with 2 or 3, it's a pass.

I find a lot of Felds games pretty hit or miss with me.

RATING: 8
The third game of Feld's "2013 Year of Games" that I've played. After 2 games I think this has the most potential to increase in ranking for me. 

Many of Feld's game tend to be about playing against the system (or more accurately, learning how to manage your play within the game system) which can include many interconnected elements, usually a novel mechanic, and sometimes convoluted interactions. Rialto on the other hand (like Strasbourg) is a relatively straightforward and simple ruleset that allows you to focus on play against the other players. 

What you choose should be based upon what you think other players are choosing. Choose the path less traveled. 

Want to play a few more games of this to really see what I think

RATING: 7
Played much faster than I thought it would, and was very streamlined for a Feld. I really enjoyed this game in it's simplicity and smooth gameplay. Essentially it's el grande if you only scored the board once, and rather than be able to send guys to different regions of the board, you can only send guys to the current of 6 regions (with one minor exception that lets you add 1 guy anywhere). Your actions are determined by the cards. The cards are chosen in player order from a series of piles where some are face up and others are face down. In this way you can influence which actions you get, but not really control which actions you get. There are balancing factors such as being able to control the point value of the different regions, and being able to build buildings for points rather than worry about the board at all.

The only grown-up Feld I own, and, frankly, my experience with Rialto hasn't exactly made me want to run out and buy all of his other games.  
So, you've got some set collection, and some variable powers/turns (think Race for the Galaxy), and a bit of area control, and, then, inevitably, two hours of figuring out who the hell won.  Guess I can see the appeal, but it wasn't magical for me.

Már szégyellem magam, hogy nem próbáltam ki! Újévi fogadalom, hogy 2 hónapon belül játszunk vele!!!!!:)
Hát ha nem is két hónapon belül, de 3-ba belefért.:) Elnézést kellene kérnem Feld Pistától, mert én se hittem benne, hogy jó játék, hittem a fanyalgóknak. Sajnos. Ez a játék a maga egyszerűségével és letisztultságával kitűnik, de abban az évban több játéka is megjelent a Pista gyereknek és talán ezért süllyedt el. Bár ennek ellenére nem értem, hogy miért nem futott be nagyobb karriert. Nagyon jó ötletek vannak benne, bár szerintem nem annyira szép, viszont áttekinthető, az alapszínek miatt. Nagy gratula.

I would certainly like to play this again as I only really got most of the rules explained part way through. Essentially you conduct six 'votes' in six regions of Venice and at the end players receive points based on how much they bid in each region. Though very different mechanically it rminded me a lot of Die Macher. The game is cleaner and more elegant than other designs by Feld and can be picked up in a single play though it is clear that enjoyment depends upon a bit more familiarity.
Definitely one to look at if you like area control election style games.

I'm a massive fan of Feld, but this game was a disappointment for me. It's not that I think anything is wrong with the game - I have no doubt there is plenty of scope for skilful play here - but I simply didn't find it that interesting. The production values are also not very good - neither cards nor board look very attractive, and that score track (where one can barely see where the spaces are) is an abomination.

I'll not often refuse to play this, but it was a big disappointment to me compared to what I was expecting.

Rialto is an area control game with a few twists.

First is the hand management part which greatly affects how and where you might get points on the board. It's a pretty clever part but does lead to an unexected importance in turn order i.e the doge track, since being top dog there will always give you first dip at what's on offer each round.

Second is the valuation of the districts which is established by the players as the game progresses. Being able to dictate where bridges go can secure a large amount of points, and again having control of that part as well as breaking the ties in your favour, by domination of the doge track, is a pretty big deal.

That's not to say the doge track is where the game is won, however being last there for a good chunk of the game will be challenging and the less people in the game the more distorted the effects. For this reason, I'd never play 2 players and I doubt 3 players is enough to balance things out... possibly. 4-5 however ensures competition is high enough that the return on investing in the lead on the doge track is not quite so clear cut.

Rating 2 players: 6. Comment: Rialto is a lighter game from Feld that could have been a great one if it wasn't for the disproportional importance of the doge track which IMO ruins the game. I hope we can find a way to house rule it adequately but out of the box it's unsatisfying (with only 2 players in the game).

Probably my #3 Feld game. Love the deciding which hand of cards to grab and which phases you're going to target each turn, since you can't do them all.  The area control aspect is not as dynamic as games like El Grande - you basically have one chance to invest pieces into a region, with maybe 1 or 2 more chances to get one piece in - it's more about manipulating the point value of the areas you have or are going to go for majority.  The Doje leader wins ties mechanic is very strong and is what won me my first game, but there are definitely other viable strategies.  You just need to be ahead of the player that's most tying you for majorities.

RATING: 6
Lots of player interaction and plenty of control. The opening decision is a choice about how you're going to attack the game. There doesn't seem to be a bad hand, just hands that allow for different approaches and buildings that allow for card flexibility.

The only worrying aspect for me is that I'm not sure it's got many different successful approaches to take. I've pretty much worked out what I think is the optimal way to play and so there's not a lot more to explore. That very arrogant statement made I'd be happy to play it again and again. It's fast and gets you thinking. Works great with a full compliment of five. There's tension to see if your numbers work out with each reveal. Rather enjoyable. Tough to choose this or Brugge as Feld's best game of 2013.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An interesting take on card drafting. Rather than drafting cards, you draft an entire pile of cards to make up your hand. What's more, you see what every player's hand will be for the turn, to help figure out what might be good/bad in a round. The area majority was a little less fluid than I like, but you could still hack it a little, and when you would sneak a piece into an area you'd also limit that from happening again. This is a game I wasn't sure what I thought about it while playing, but really resonated with me in the post-game.

In a word, disappointing.  I mean, it's ok, but ok for me in a Feld title isn't good enough.  The card laying gets tiresome and it just doesn't flow together as elegantly as most of Feld's other designs.  In what is supposed to be his big 4-game year, this is a dud following the very strong Bora Bora.  I was hoping that Feld could make one of my least favorite game mechanics - area control - shine, but he didn't.  I almost get the impression that he sort of mailed this one in.  I'll give it a 7, but if it was anyone else, I'd probably knock a point off of that.

Played one 4P game. In Rialto, Stefan Feld infuses the area majority genre with his signature touch of getting players to balance several aspects of the game, which include jostling for turn order. Each round sees players competing to place councilmen into a single Venetian district, so it is rather difficult to recapture a district which has already passed. This means that players have to focus on certain rounds to do well, and know when to give in.

Some icons explaining the effects of the gondola and bridge cards would have certainly helped and the VP track really needs to be numbered clearly. Rialto is an okay game, with no real faults, but no wow factor either.

On the light side for Feld, which means that it's shorter and shallower. Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable game with some hard decisions about resource allocation, neat card selection, and an interesting pseudo-bid. I think Bruges did much of this better, but this is still a nice change of pace.

Stefan Feld egyik nap egy régi barátjával találkozott, aki előbányászott a táskája aljáról egy kék színű ütött-kopott dobozt. A San Marco volt az, ami Feldet lenyűgözte, rögtön el is döntötte, hogy ő ezt továbbgondolja, így született meg a Rialto. Van egy sanda gyanúm, hogy elég közel áll a fenti történet az igazsághoz, mert Feld új játéka rendkívüli hasonlóságot mutat az SM-el. Egyrészt ugyanott játszódik. A zseniális kártyaosztó mechanizmust annyival oldotta meg, hogy random csinálunk eggyel több kupacot, mint a játszók száma és van egy sáv, amin aki elől van az választ először. A játék fő része ugyanúgy a területi többség a térkép kerületein, annyival bolondította meg, hogy épületeket is lehet a saját kis táblánkon építeni, ami különböző előnyöket ad. Tulajdonképpen kaptunk egy gémerebb San Marcot. A játék működik, nehezebb döntési helyzetek vannak, de a San Marco letisztult egyszerűsége nálam nagyobbat ütött. Ha ezt ismerem meg előbb biztos dobok egy hátast, de így nem ütött akkorát. Szokásos jó iparosmunka a német mestertől, ami nagyon jól működik, de semmi extra.

Taught this to my 8-yr old and he picked it up fairly quickly.  The decision of which cards to keep / discard at the end of Phase I seemed to take the longest as that's where you need to have a good idea of your card play strategy for the whole round.  He enjoyed collecting buildings and activating their special powers.  The biggest complaint for me is the scoring track which is inexplicably confusing.  All in all this is a quick fun family game that I think will be enjoyed for a long time.

1 play, 3er

The game is sort of like San Marco crossed with Taj Mahal: area control, managed across regions in random order, based on a series of auctions. There are more types of auctions, building tiles, and extra stuff here. Still, although I like San Marco OK I'm not a huge fan of Taj Mahal. The game works, but I wasn't really excited by it. And there are an awful lot of auctions here (clever though they are)!

--- Summary ---
The board shows 6 regions, with numbered chips arranged in random positions; in turn, each region will be the main focus. 

Each turn begins by allocating cards: n+1 rows of 8 cards (6 face-up, 2 face-down) are placed in display. In turn order (determined by a Feldian track; random at first), players take one row then discard down to 7 cards. Some buildings they may have built earlier may allow them draw additional cards (either from deck or from the unchosen row) and/or increase the hand limit. The cards are of 6 types, plus a joker.

Next, play through 6 steps in order, one per card type. Each time, players will bid using that card type (jokers can be used as wilds to supplement a bid, but need 2 jokers for the first bid if using only jokers). You are bidding on things like moving up on the turn order (and tie-breaker) track, collecting coins, taking your tokens from supply, placing your tokens into the current round's region, placing a bridge, build a building. The more you bid, the better the effect; there is a bonus for the high bidder (usually increasing the value of your bid by 1).

Finally, players may use their buildings, paying 1 coin each.

Players collect VPs during the game from some buildings and by placing bridges, and at the end of the game based on majority of tokens in each region (by rank: full value, half that, half that, etc.). The value of each region is based on the specific bridges and gondolas placed during the game. Bridges come up in random order, have different values 3-6 on either end, and are placed across the canals connecting regions; gondolas have 1s at either end. There are specific locations for all bridges and gondolas.

RATING: 7
This game feels strikingly un-Feldian to me.  Not just because there isn't a unique dice mechanic.  Feld games, in my experience, are known for providing a wealth of available options to the players each turn but only the ability or resources to accomplish a small amount of what they want or need to do.  While playing this game I felt I could do most or all of what I wanted to do each turn or I could sacrifice that for doing something very well.  I also felt like there weren't a lot of branching paths I could take, decisions came pretty easily to me.

The game is played across 6 rounds where rows of cards are drafted.  The cards come in 7 different flavors, 6 contribute to an action you can take with the 7th being a wild card.  Each round the players step through 6 phases where they play a number of these cards to take a specific action, whoever plays the most gets an additional bonus as well as an effect relative to the number of cards played.  These actions do different things from building buildings, acquiring resources, and moving pieces around a board which contribute points in area control fashion at the end of the game.

It was a fine game, at least living up to the polish you would expect from a Feld design.  But I felt like it didn't have much original to stand out to me and certainly felt like the decisions were mostly easy and uninteresting.

Not very Feldian in that there not many ways of scoring points - majorities, buildings, coins/meeples and area. bonus. 

Also not as attractive to look at as other recent Pegasus games, with the scoring track a shocker.

After one play with three I thought it would be much better with four or five - more competition for bonuses and the doge track. The three players each took a different approach and there appears to be viable and different approaches to the game. However the card drafting was less interesting than I had hoped. Looking forward to trying with 4 - so far a 6 based on one play.

There are some mildly interesting timing issues around turn order after the bonus and trying to manipulate the area values.

Much more enjoyable  with 4 than 3. However 2nd play. reinforces my feeling that this is solid rather than spectacular, lacking an X factor and its gone

On paper, Rialto was my most hotly anticipated of this year's Stefan Feld releases. In practice, I'm not sure. It's relatively simple compared to some of his other recent games (like the overwrought Bora Bora), and has such strong similarities to Moon and Weissblum's San Marco that I wonder if it were named "Rialto" in homage.

Each round, players choose a row of six face up cards, plus two face down, which are then used in a series of unconventional once-around "auctions", one per suit. I use scare quotes around "auction" because, while accurate, the word is misleading. Clockwise from the player furthest on the Doge track, each can play as many cards as they want in the current suit, with each card played providing one unit of whatever benefit that suit offers (coin cards give coins, council cards allow placement of a councilman in the current region), and whoever plays the most gets a bonus (an extra coin, an extra placement...). The card play is more clearly an auction in the "bridge" and "gondola" suits, where the bonus -- place a bridge or place a gondola and a dude -- is far more valuable than the card benefit.

The general goal is to achieve majorities in the six regions (which are moved through, one per round, a la Taj Mahal) and to increase the value of regions in which you will score a majority. This is interesting because the value of each area is determined by the bridges and gondolas that are built leading into it, as placed by the winner of the "bridge" and "gondola" auction. The trick is that bridges are valuable (up to six points), while gondolas are not (one point), but a gondola traghetto allow the placement of a single councilman on either side. As councilmen can normally only be placed using the councilman auction on the current region, the gondola is the only way to change the majority in a previously-visited region. 

The result is a very dynamic area majority experience, with (it [i]is[/i] a Feld game) a bolted-on engine-building element.

Even writing about it now I am excited about the promise of the system, so I'm as surprised as anyone to have come away from it lukewarm. There are minor irritations, such as how annoyingly advantageous it is to sit to the right of the player who is first on the Doge track. But the real problem is that the card acquisition reminds me just enough of San Marco to want to play San Marco and the card play reminds me just enough of Taj Mahal to want to play Taj Mahal -- it loses by comparison. I am inclined to think that it is less than the sum of its parts.

RATING: 7.7
A "lighter" Feld, but nevertheless again a clever design. The importance of seating order during the bidding reminds me of Strasbourg (and Poker, of course), but there is also the new twist of the buildings.
I like how every phase (Doge, gold, bridges, gondoliers etc.) has a different but important impact on your game.

My only criticism: the victory point track is a complete failure for it is very hard to read.

I'm enjoying this. While the Venice location immediately reminds you of San Marco, the game plays a bit more like Feld's Strasbourg or Schacht's Web Of Power - using cards to place (and never move) pieces for area influence.

Les choix sont différents des autres Feld et ça fait du bien. Par exemple au lieu de choisir entre 5 façon de faire des points, je choisis quand dépenser mes cartes pour faire des points, C'est subtil mais crée de l'interaction avec les choix des autres. Et pas trop long en plus.

Some nifty ideas here, and I wanted to like this. However, Rialto has one of worst runaway leader, rich-get-richer problems I've seen in a game in a long time. As soon as one player is able to buy the building that allows you to draw and keep more cards, especially if he does it early, the game is over. Just keep on buying this building and soon you are outpacing everyone else by a wide margin ... drawing enough cards to get exactly what you need and keeping enough that you can win every auction that you want. Sadly, compared with this, no other strategy is viable, making the game completely skewed if not outright broken.

After 1 play: I'm sure you can really burn your brain about this one if you want to, but I did not feel invited to think much. Grab a pile of cards that looks promising and play most of them. I guess with more plays I would know better, but it was just not enough fun to play more often.

I am a bit less impressed with this title than I am with most of Mr. Feld's other designs, however after playing a second time using the correct rules, I like it enough to raise my initial rating from 6 to 7. The advantage of remembering the opponent's draft in order to know most, but not all of what he is capable of bidding on six different things is not that appealing to me.

Great area control game. Simple, and it runs in about 90 min with 4 players with explanations. We play that all phases run in turn order.

RATING: 7
Rialto is a fairly quick area control game. You choose sets of cards in turn order (or more accurately doge order) and then play them during the different action phases of the game. There are special buildings that change some rules/give points. You get a few extra cards and can use buildings to get more, but you've got a hand limit (which can also be modified by buildings).

The values of areas are established over the course of the game. And each area pays out at game end as full points for first, half that for second and half that for third. A large part of your score can come from just playing points cards, building buildings and activating buildings in lieu of area scoring.

Overall it's not as good as I was hoping, nor as bad as some people have claimed. I want to give it a few more plays before I make any decisions on this one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
[thing=119591][/thing] is a truly differentiated area control game, mainly because it allows to have area control without much in terms of hassle and fight for the places, often quite present in the genre; it is truly an "euromization" of one of the less euro types of mechanisms.

The mechanics of [thing=119591][/thing] are quite well done, being simple to play and clever, demanding choices and decisions all around, as well as prioritizing - is necessary to pick which battles to take and which to let go, as simply isn't possible to try to gain many things each round; thus seeking the best opportunities to seize is a must. [thing=119591][/thing] is mostly about balancing your choices.

A play passes in a lively rhythm, with the actions being done in a speedy execution, once the choices of which stack of cards to take and what cards to keep are done, many of the rest of round is in auto-mode.

I quite enjoy that the regions on the board don't start with a define value - what they will be worth is decided by the players, during the game - is part of the strategy to try to make regions you care the most value more at the end.

There is luck in game - most of it in the stacks available and in drawing cards. Still, I consider that decisions will matter more in the long run.

Overall, I like [thing=119591][/thing] and recommend it.

It's nice that Feld has finally designed another game that doesn't have 5,271,009 different mechanisms, but this one has issues. The main one is that the buildings don't seem very balanced; granted, a lot of games get "unbalanced" comments shortly after release which turn out to be groundless, but in this game having extra cards to play seems so good that it's hard to see how the buildings that allow that aren't the best to get early. A lesser concern is that the Doge track tie-breaking has the potential to be really swingy.

RATING: 6
Not a traditional Feldian design in the sense, except for the initiative track which is a staple of his. A word about the components: this game was reprinted by TMG and the components are awful. Many of the wooden pieces had different shapes and not uniform. Some were chipped and uneven. The board looks drab and the worst part of the game was the score track. Come on now! Try playing this game as a  prototype. Can you not see the need to redo your scoring track?

That said, the game is fine as is. If you own San Marco, this game feels similar, both in theme and in game mechanics. First, both games are area majority games with Doge going around the different venician quarters scoring points. The splitting and choosing mechanism in San Marco is found in a slightly different form and feel in Rialto. So, if you liked or hated San Marco, I'd expect more or less the same with Rialto. Still, Rialto does have a few more things going for it compared to San Marco. The card selection mechanism based off the initiative track is neat. The building powers are fine though not particularly memorable. One thing I didn't particularly like is the relatively inability to contest for districts after the doge has visited the region. The gondola is the only way you can go back and change the area majority by adding one extra councilman to each district, which is a relatively weak power.

Overall, the game is what it is, squarely in the middle of the road: a decent but not particularly enduring design.

Another smooth game.  Many viable strategies and much depends on what the other players do on their turns.  It reminds me a little of Year of the dragon with the start player (Doge) track.  That is familiar and then each phase with the cards is a bit of bluff and planning.  Very nicely put together.

Stefan Feld level theme application (because hey, it deserves its own classification).

What can I say. None of us were expecting a Feld game to be so hostile! And it doesn't even have direct conflict or combat! Many of his games allow players to more or less do their own things, with a sprinkling of light interaction/inter-player determination, but Rialto eventually has players drastically changing the state of play. Like all Feld games, there's a lot to do and you'll never be able to do it all, but selecting the right action at the right time and adapting to those changes as precipitated by other players' actions is now super important.

This is a bit like Notre Dame but waaaay nastier.

First play impressions: A ton of stuff to track and pretty difficult to tell what is a viable strategy.

It's yet another game where the depth seems buried under a ton of information to juggle, but I'm willing to chalk it up to rushing into the game and seeing if things come together next time. If I read over the rules myself I doubt it would seem nearly as complicated as it did, since it's apparently lighter than San Marco and I didn't have any problems with that.

Rialto is not "another typical point salad Feld", it has a different flavour than his other designs. The gameplay is quick and smooth, but at the same time it forces players to make some difficult choices. Don't be fooled with the short manual - Rialto can be a real brain-burner and tough exercise in efficiency. It's one of these "easy to learn, hard to master" games. There's a lot of subtle strategic moves to be discovered over repeated plays. 

The only drawback is the graphic design of the scoring track - moving the markers between the lanterns is a nightmare!

/update: I've sold it to make space on my shelf for other games, but I kind of regret it now. It's a really cool design.

A full 8 for a simple interesting game with the same elements but completely different mechanics of San Marco.
The game flows well and it even seems "too short". There are constantly too many things you want to come but this time mister Feld avoids to put a quantity of little elements that clog the mind (like in Bora Bora, that is a better game that I live as a dawnting task  when i approach it). Very enjoyable, I would play it again soon.

The art is good but it is common opinion that the points track is quite confusing: i like its aspect but indeed i can confirm that it is good as a frame, not as a scoring device.

[EDIT] I really need to raise this to a full 9: it's compact and every single decision is tense and important. You can't do everything, you must go for a definite strategy and there are different paths to victory, depending on what you are focusing on. Wonderful, and some replayability is guaranteed by the different order of the islands.

As rich Noble merchants in renaissance Venice we vie to spread our influence through the city one district at a time. Communal game board of the six districts and green, yellow, and blue building tiles. Player boards for your buildings, workers, and gold. The trick of the game is planning for the cards you for the round phases. Draw cards blind or select from the unselected face up row. Doge track system for tie breaking and starting player and to earn a bonus. Play brick cards to build. Place a gold on the building to use it. Each round go through the phases; ... Bridges, gondolas to get workers, and council to place workers. Area majority of districts with workers for additional points. Cool board of venice districts. Not a heavy game. Seems good but kinda blurs with the others.

7.5->6 Game isnt too exciting and has very tight scoring

Basically winning majority in something is +1point compared to others. Majorities split quite even in a whole game. Winner is decided on area control and 5 point tokens for building first each other of 2 areas. I think this as a lighter version of Strasbourg, and everything what is clever in it, has been removed. Talking about tasks and card picking. Tiebreaker track reminds me of Year of the Dragon, which is bad thing.

I keep hearing this is a light Feld game... but I feel it is simply more streamlined than his other fist full of mini-games games.  The card play is very interesting and it seems like focusing on area control or buildings or a combination of things should all be viable ways to win.  Perhaps a bit to explain for such a short game, but once people get what the cards do and how everything in the game interacts I think this will provide a lot of decisions for such a short game.  I'm looking forward to playing more to find out!

It’s not a secret that we’re big fans of Stefan Feld. We were looking forward towards this game, together with his new releases Bora Bora & Brügge. As a special birthday present, somebody translated the rules into Dutch. In the box are German and English rules, and the game itself is language independent. Rules are very clear, and after reading, you could explain this game to somebody within five minutes. The most complexity is in phase 2, where people play 6 different cards in a predefined order. Each card has its own action and a bonus. As there are no little drawing on the cards, herein is the difficulty. You’ll have to remember which action comes with each type of card, and what the bonuses are. But I guess after three or four times playing, this also will be clear.

Then the game. It sounds like fun. It looks great. Well, at first sight it looks great. After taking a closer look to the gameboard, you’ll discover one of the worst designed score-tracks in boardgaming industry. It is really hard to track your score, and you’ll have to know that there is printed a number every 5 points. When we play a Feld game, we expect a clever designed game, full of tiny mechanisms that perfectly fits together. Well, with this game, that’s not the case. What you get, is a very light, luck depended, family game. Almost no strategy is possible. After playing we were disappointed in this one. Not that it’s a bad game. Not at all (if a games scores somewhere around 7, it’s still a good game), but we expected more of this one. My guess is, that this one, will not hit the table many times again.

Typical Feld: Sooooo many ways to win, and you want to do about 8 things each turn with the resources to do 2 or 3 of them.  I was outplayed horribly in my first game but still had fun playing.  Easily explained for those less familiar with games, but has a wealth of strategy that could possibly make for some AP moments.

Only complaint I have is that the "Doge" track for tie-breaking feels shoehorned in here.  Feld uses a track like this (token on top is first, below is second...etc.) in every game he designs and it just isn't necessary here.

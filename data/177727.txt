This is a very stunning looking abstract game that mixes in some euro-scoring at the end. Essentially, players play numbered disks to either move their shaman or the boat. When the boat moves, cards around the playing board are resolved, which can earn points in a variety of ways. But the biggest way to score points is building statues where your shamans stand (and thus why you move your shamans so much in the game). This is also the most interactive element as the volcano will explode and players have the ability to manipulate how the lava flows down the mountain. 

Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the game has a tactical/advanced variant that reduces the luck associated with the lava. And while I've found the tactical/advanced variant to provide a slightly richer experience, the base game is quite good and not that luck driven, as players can manipulate those lava tokens. Basically, the game is quite satisfactory regardless of how you play it.

Overall, there is a lot to like about this game. The abstract/rondel nature of the game feels unique and the component quality is visually stunning. Also, I really like how quick and easy this game is to teach and set-up. That being said, I've found the gameplay to be one dimensional. Basically, the game became a race to put your statues in the forest, which earn more victory points than the grass but aren't as susceptible to lava as the mountains. That doesn't mean this game isn't deep... on the contrary, this game is very much a rabbit-hole where you can analyzed any move ad nauseam. It's just seems to have the tendency to develop similarly game-to-game.

Artwork is beautiful. Rules could be condensed a little more. By the time we got to learning this game (after learning two other games), we were a bit tired. So it was a bit sloppy. But this is lovely. Definitely willing to play it at least 10 more times before I make a final call on it.

Oke the looks of this game did not asked to be bought when we first spotted this game at Spiel 2015. But now (May 2016) we bought this game at Spielewahsinn cause some indepth research told us we might like this game. And we do! The first 2 plays we 'just fiddled around ' but now after the 3rd game we discovered the tactics of this game. There is enough interaction, some push your luck but most of all: enoying your opponent.

RATING: 6
2 player strategy game that plays in half an hour. Players take turns placing numbered disks that allow movement of their own token and a shared boat token. The boat determines which sixth of the map will be contested for cards, depending on which player disks had been placed there previously. Basically a race to place totem pieces across the board via card play, and picking up score cards to get some extra VP from those totems. There's a bit of risk with the higher valued places, seems like a fun game but hard to remain invested.

30-60m, 2 players. < 5 plays.

Nice 2 player game that may sound and look somewhat strange (loos like a kid's game to me), but offers a good amount of options. While there are only a few (easy) rules, there are many things to consider and keep in check when playing the game.

Great stuff!

I actually prefer the "randomic lava" above the player guided one, as I find that the lattest makes the game feel too scripted for my tastes.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The game works fine but I sure didn't find it that enjoyable. The volcano can be quite nasty and one wants to be careful about where the ship ends up when taking cards (ideally, you don't have statues in that district to avoid the chance of volcano damage). You place or remove your 5 player markers to move your shaman unless you place a player marker on the same area as the ship in which case you move the ship  the number of areas according to the number on the marker.

RATING: N/A
Nice production for this 2-player only game. Bright and colorful. We played the base game way, which has the the lava come out via random card draw, with the ability to move the lava away from your own pieces via obtaining other cards. The tactical variant is also included with the game once you play the regular way first. In the variant you have more control over the lava via using a personal invocation disc, and there are only 4 lava discs that come out. There are 8 that come out in the regular game. It could be that the game plays better with the variant. I was ahead in scoring until the very end when my opponent moved two lava discs to destroy multiple scoring opportunities of mine, which cost me the game.

A solid, two-player only affair. The game is all about setting up several moves in advance and hoping your opponent has other things to worry about than messing up your plan. The variety of scoring opportunities work particularly well given the two-player nature of the game, and the overall impression is of a game that punches above its weight, offering more decisions than its rules complexity might suggest. Likely to hit the table plenty more in the future.

Got this at Essen 2015. 
It's a solid "semi-abstract" game and I like the way movement was combined with the area control, but eventually it was just "ok" and somehow was lacking something more special. Just fell a bit flat after a couple of plays.

Amazing lack of comments and sales for this game. I love the volcano/island/boat/lava flow theme. Reminds me of bora bora, but finishes much faster. I took a chance on the purchase and glad I did. Looks great, small footprint, fast setup, two player only, and offers enough decisions to keep it thinky, but not exhausting. Deserves a mich wider audience. (Bought from Quiche games)

This is a clever and very enjoyable  2 player game, very good components and a lot more depth than the rules would lead one to believe.

We have played several times now and each game has worked out differently but created some very interesting tactical situations ...

Not sure why it's only rating in the 6s ...

Maybe now the the English version is available its rating will increase as more people play it ...should be in the early 7s ...

I don't understand the low scores of this one. There is clearly a lot more going on then just putting down some numbered disks. It's not as easy as the rules - or the theme - let you think, you'll probably have to play this a couple of times to fully understand how you can manipulate things in your favour. 

Edit 08/11/2015: increased rating after second play. Now I knew which cards that are in each deck - and I also explained this to my opponent - it's far from easy to put the right disk on the right beach.

This game is very strategic but simple with respect to rules. Almost to the point that its a pure abstract. Hard to get a grasp of this one after one play but thinking many moves ahead can really reward you in this game. The premise is simple, either place or remove a disc and move your shaman or place a disc next to the boat and gather a card. A really good two player game for those who are looking for deeper strategy and less tactile game play.

Better with Tactical variant.   But can be a brain burner if you try to AP this one to death.  But if you don't, nice flowing easy to grasp, with a lot of deeper strategy inside.  A great presentation and components,    Not sure why this one got slightly swept under the rug...   I think it's pot ethical and audience will grow as Haleakala is discovered.

What an absolute delight. The key to 2p games, I feel, is striking a balance between immediate and delayed actions. Many games quoting player-counts from 2 to x players often change dramatically when played with just 2. A game that works well with interleaved player behaviour and interruption often falls flat with only 2, as the game is reduced to an either-or, push-pull dynamic, meaning either one player is guaranteed a high scoring opportunity or the other is, determined without any input from the players themselves.

This game disarms the two player binary problem by delaying player actions indefinitely until they chose to chase them down. This allows both players to balance some planning with emergent opportunities, given that the board-state may be favourable in a different way after the opponent takes their turn. There are various viable strategies available and pivoting from one to another is a simple affair should the former be blocked or interrupted.

Of-course the design is solid and play-length absolutely perfect, but it's always super nice to have a game as visually gorgeous as this - beautifully illustrated and with great components rising from the board. This, along with Targi, should be regarded as essential for any solid 2p collection.

It's a strategy game for two people with an optional bit of random in the beginners variant. 

Played in Essen (2015). It took about 10-15 minutes to explain the game. After that it plays quickly. With each turn we learned to appreciate the depth of the strategic decisions. The moves a player can make are limited so it doesn't take forever to decide but at the same time there are enough options and strategies that give the game a lot of depth. So it's one of those easy-to-learn yet hard-to-master games. The  material is beautiful and solidly made like I expected from Feuerland. 

I am looking forward to playing this game again quite a bit. Higher ranking pending further games.

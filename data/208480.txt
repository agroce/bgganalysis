Simple and quick word game, where you are trying to make up a word up as quickly as possible from consonants of various point values. I'm terrible at it, but it goes fast enough to not be a problem.

This is going to replace Prolix as my favorite word game. Quicker, easier to teach, but with everything I loved about Prolix. Can't wait for my copy.

One of the best word games out there. The problem with most word games is that you're so limited by the cards/tiles you have, and they force you to use exactly what you have, resulting in folks making a lot of short, boring words.

However, in Wordsy, you can come up with any words you want, scoring more points the more of the 8 letters on display you use. So, your options are wide open, which is great!

It also has the best "challenge" rule I've seen if someone doesn't think another player made a real word. If you want to challenge someone else, you lose 2 points if it turns out their word is actually a word, which prevents players from making frivolous challenges.

If anyone suggests Scrabble, this is what I'll suggest instead.  No chance for analysis paralysis due to the timed mechanism, and everyone is building words every round, so little downtime.  Suffers from the usual word-game problem of folks with smaller vocabularies feeling left out.  Not usually going to set the kitchen table on fire with laughter, but it's a fine game to chill out with.

Fun, fast paced word game that, unlike most word games, has player interaction.  The nice thing about this game is that it forces you to think outside the available letters.

RATING: 8
This is a fun word game where speed is important, but not as important as taking your time to try to find a way to use the high value letters in your word. This game almost feels like "Word on the Street" because there are certain letters with more value at a given time.

Good word game. The bonus on the score timer is what makes the game cool.
Solo variant is pretty good too.
I'm not much of a word game fan. I gave it to a neighbor that loves words games. They love it! If you like word games this is for you!

Gave this game as a gift for my mother who loves to play scrabble, and finds it difficult to try out new games. It was a hit right away. Love the detail and extra strategy options with the hourglass. She is far better at word games, but can't handle pressure very good so I was still able to win :)  Impressed with the details (pencil, good quality box, very good rule book with examples, all the rules on the score sheet). 

Fun game, very easy to learn, hard to master.

Played the PnP version (using Prolix bits). 
Quick playing word game that rewards a large vocabulary (rather than memorizing lists of 2- and 3- letter words). 

Looking forward to playing the published version!

It takes the word game into some free and novel search space, requiring meanderingly long "UNBEWILDERINGLY"-type words that hit all the target consonants. Which are fun to write down, but it feels like too much is happening invisibly in players' heads, compared to other wordfinding games. In Boggle, there's a nice should-have-seen-that kick when you miss a long word; Wordsy feels like the search space is too huge for that kind of reaction.

Rating based on 4 players.

I love word puzzles in general, but I am rather picky when it comes to word games. Most have stressful timers, restrictive word constraints, long amounts of downtime, or are completely non-interactive between players. Wordsy, on the other hand, deals with all these issues! The timer keeps things moving but is generous enough that people don't need to scramble, everyone has access to the same letters so direct competition makes sense, and it rewards long words instead of weird short ones. Very simple rules where you can start playing within minutes. Happy I Kickstarted this one!

I'm not usually a word game guy, but I enjoyed this one. Very free form and allowing for some clever plays and not feeling stuck like I do in scrabble. I'd like to play this with my mom who I think would enjoy a lot.

RATING: 5
Quite simply less effective than other word-building games. I don't see why I'd choose this over Paperback or Word Bits, both of which are mediocre in their own right. Tedious and over-complicated scoring system tends to slow everything down.

I'm not much of a fan of word games, primarily because they are very skill-based and reward those with a large vocabulary. However, this one was pretty fun, because I think that you are able to come up with words that have more than the letters that you see.

A revision of Prolix. Simple rules, clever scoring bonuses (for uncommon/rare letters, for being fast, for being slow but having a better word), fun for wordsmiths, OK for me.

Played a couple of test games with the designer. A smart, quick playing, word game, which has many levels to play. You can make short quick Words to put pressure on your opponent, or try and come up with long, high scoring words, to try and out score them.

Hands down favorite word game. Not requiring vowel cards is brilliant, the shifting board is great, and working against a clock can be very intense. Even solo it's top notch. My only complaint would be scoring, which is a little overly complex.

Just like Prolix but a bit more streamlined. If you love word-building games and real-time challenges, this is perfect for you. You better have a group (or person) that feels as strongly as you do though!

Little gem of a word game. It has an elegant feel, from the design of the box to the smooth game play. From a little bag of letters, some pencils and simple rules, a game emerges that feels like it should have always existed. Anyone can play; it's fast, clever, and fun. Highly recommended if that's what you are looking for.

Anti-Scrabble sounded wonderful to me, and Wordsy pulls it off. It's sharp, quick, and incredibly clever. Every player will have at least one round where the entire table applauds them for a killer word. It's great.

This is probably the most fun I've had with a word game other than the complete masterpiece word deduction game, [thing=4079][/thing]. Wordsy is super-quick, super-fun, and truly, truly streamlines and optimizes the experience of [thing=39635][/thing]. Sure, it's best with Gil as the MC or as an opponent, but I assure you that it's fun, even without him; you will supply your own enthusiasm, trust me.

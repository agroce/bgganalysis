RATING: 8
CLassic hex and counter game with fantastic graphics.  Game play is fast and clean, but with plenty of detail.  The movement rules are generous for attacking through restrictive terrein.  Plenty of tactical and operational decisions that affect victory or defeat.  I did find that as the German player I was able to progress accross a broad front.  Game is not a smulation.  If you prefer more detail, go with Ardennes 44.  Both are great games and will stay on my shelf.

I was initially wary of this game with its tiny rulebook and SPI quadlike simplicity.  But you know what, this is a very good game.  Feels like it has all the needed chrome and yet is fast and competitive.  Much better than I thought it would be.

Very obvious that the designer went the extra mile in putting this game together with so much care. Even though most of the time games out somewhat ahistorical, this game fits a perfect niche for me with a lot of historical of chrome and though its not simple, its not overly complex either. Even that can be adjusted with optional rules. The fact that there is a high quantity of optional rules and scenarios just makes this one that much better.

Gorgeous art on the box, counters and map. Also, the box is huge (bigger than Europe Engulfed!), almost unnessarily so. The rules are pretty easy and not all that long (about 12 pages or so without optional rules) so this isn't one of those games with a huge learning curve.

It's got a counter for the nurse who flirted away Fritz Bayerlein's afternoon and stalled the German advance!  First Bulge game ever to recall her contribution (Weapon of Mass Seduction).  Beautiful graphics throughout, large easy-on-the-eyes plasticized map and big colorful counters.

Just got DBW, and I have to say that the components are a real step up from the AH edition.  Counters are 5/8", easy on the eyes and the set up charts and rule books are well done.  The expansion rulebook is an improvement over the extremely servicable DBW rulebook, in that it has color illustrations and examples of play.  The map is on heavy cardstock, and I would have liked a two piece map to the multifold one piece, but it is a stunning map.

Worth having for any Bulge gamer.  Initial rating raised after a couple games.

The Holy Grail of rules. Most know the general mojo of this game so i'll just throw in a few precise points from my experience so far. Steep learning curve for the first few turns due to the fairly large amount of chrome, but thats not a bad thing just brain draining. The rule system makes you think strategically and tactically far more than a standard nato counter type ruleset, you can't get this polished without the history that the game has. Bitter woods is a bit like generals...this isn't fresh out of the academy it's a seasoned veteran in the twilight of his years but the shining height of his powers.

I get the itch to play the Bulge once or twice a year, when I do this is the game of choice.  The L2 production is gorgeous.  The map, counters and set up charts  - nothing exotic just good looking and very playable.

I suspect that the Germans have a better chance here then they did historically, but only by enough to make things a real nail biter for both sides.

The game has several solid smaller scenarios as well.  In fact, my favorite way to play the game is Patton's Relief of Bastogne ... as both player's get to be on the offensive, and the mosh pit in the North is ignored.  Another good choice is the six turn tournament scenario which covers the first three days of the offensive.  If Jerry doesn't win here, he's not going to.  Be warned, it always leaves you wanting to continue play.

The game excels at writing a great narrative, with plots lines the swirl around the mistakes you've made.  It can be so intense that you take breaks in play, you call it a night because you want to contemplate your options before playing the next turn.

Yes, it's *that* kind of a game.

If you get the urge to Battle in the Ardennes, seriously consider this title.

Graphically amazing, probably the best looking and produced wargame out there.  Not too complicated, moderate length.  A very fun game.

Please see my detailed review on the game's page.

One of its primary strengths, low counter density, is its only weaknesses in my opinion.  Due to the fixed starting positions and few counters, playing against an expert players feels a bit too much like chess.  That is, the first few moves feel pre-programed, and the loss of any piece (particularly for the US) can be devastating.  Still, a great game for evenly matched opponents.

RATING: 7
It's a fine game.  It plays very well and is a big challenge for both sides once both players get through the learning curve.  Some things seem rather odd to me or don't play exactly the way I think they should.  Examples include the rocket launchers that in reality were towed by trucks but can move through woods like infantry, the lack of attrition to attacking armor (just include a weak infantry to soak up any step losses suffered).  And the game seems to require you to form a continuous line while at the same time making it easy for the attacker to cut other units off after the defender retreats.  I point these things out not because the game has any real faults but because it is setting itself up to be measured to a very high standard (4th, "Deluxe" edition).

I actually have the original Avalon Hill edition with the first MMP update kit, though I've never played it.

Part of the enjoyment of playing wargames comes from the tactile and visual element. The board is very attractive. The counters feel good. The rules are clean. It is one of the better Battle of the Bulge games that I have come across. There is a lot of chrome and so repeated plays will enhance the enjoyment. The deluxe edition comes with several scenarios and optional rules.

After one abbreviated game, my initial impressions were not great. It definitely seems like a chess game for the Americans, who must move certain units into certain hexes and perform specific actions early in the game.

And that's only if the Germans don't get an ENG result, or knock you past that one chateux. Otherwise, you can get the Germans flying across the board at break neck speed because there aren't any supply restrictions at all in the first four turns.

The end result is what feels very much like a game, but not a simulation. The good news is that the rules are pretty easy to grasp, the exceptions minimal and the game is good looking. So, a game I might play again from time to time, but would generally prefer one of the other Bulge games over this.

Passable game system but inadequate in creating a true Bulge experience. Making the German victory conditions dependent on securing "victory condition towns" leads to the strange situation where the Germans are forced to heavily invest these towns, instead of having the option to bypass. (Whether they should bypass or not is beside the point - the German player should have the option, and not have the game make it for him.) Also strange is where the US player can be completely blase about German units crossing the Meuse to exit off-map, as long as the US player is confident of securing the "victory condition towns".  Quite unlike history where the main preoccupation of the US historically was to stop the Germans from crossing the Meuse.

Very good game.  Like other L2 Design Group games, the quality of all pieces in the game are exceptional.  Most of the rules are very easy to understand and they are written well.  However I did have some questions about some rules and I emailed L2 3 times in an effort to clear up the rule questions.  All 3 of my emails to them went unanswered.   My rating would be higher if this were not the case.  I do like the larger counters and hexes.  This makes the counters easier to manage and thus it is easier to keep track of things.  I have found that the game favors the Germans, although each time I played the game it was harder for them to win.  My last game saw the Germans ekeing out a mild victory.

The different types of armor for both the Allies and the Axis weren't generic looking but had great imiages of the different types of tanks.  I especially liked the divisional unit crests of each unit that took part in the battle, embossed on the counters.  So far, I found this to be the best Bulge game that I have ever played.

RATING: 7
Nicely illustrated map of the Bulge area, with beautifully detailed counters that are large & easy to read. Just the right complexity level- fantastic. This particular battle holds much interest for me, since I grew up in southern Belgium, 45 minutes from Bastogne, not far from the Ourthe river. That being said, it is a lot more fun for the German player to try & breakthrough, & an agonizing, sweating struggle for the US/British player to contain & hopefully counterpunch later with Patton if one plays that scenario. The Bulge is not one of the better WWII battles in terms of balance, but can be a nail biter none the less.

Well, yes, another Bulge game in my collection.  I have them all, pretty much.  Big and small.  And, this is the finest Regimental Level Bulge game on the market.  Don't just take my word for it.  Danny S Parker, noted Battle of the Bulge expert, Historian and author gives this game the highest praise.  And, Deluxe Bitter Woods is also extremely well researched.  Randy Heller has dedicated all his energies to making this game the best it can be, and it shows!

Excellent graphics, gorgeous map, beautiful counters, the Deluxe Edition is the final say.  Well balanced, easy to play, this game has been a favorite at conventions for years.   This alone testifies to the staying power of this fantastic game.  Randy Heller and Bruno Sinigaglio are to be commended for their dedication and commitment to excellence.  If you love the Battle of the Bulge, this game is your only choice.  Try the others, but you will play this one over and over again!

Bitter Woods is my favorite Bulge game, although, admittedly, it's not my favorite battle. I like the L2 version best; the only difference I can see between it and the later Compass game is one extra scenario in Compass' and its red-coated Britishers. L2's are light brown. Some players may mistake them for light grey Germans, but our group doesn't. Bitter Woods, in all its flavors, can be won by both sides, and requires good play. This looks like it has more roads than other Bulge games; players need to be alert to all enemy opportunities. There is a plethora of optional rules to use to adjust  any balance issues a group experiences.

One of my Top 3 games.  I view each turn as a puzzle to be solved where the solution is a move that tries to accomplish your objectives.  And that includes accounting for all the possible die roll outcomes!  Definitely not to be viewed as a simulation, lots of things happen that seem odd.  Example:  Attacker losses don't exist at 4-1 odds or greater.  Regardless of that, it's a blast to play and definitely rewards serious study.

Several plays confirm that BW is too chess-like for my taste.  In particular, a wrong move by the US player on turn 1 or 2 and it is all over.  A few 'Engaged' or D3 results on the turn 1 German attacks can also be very bad.

I think I prefer more of a simulation, and even FAB:The Bulge is a more realistic account of the battle.

Good: Operational - Western Front -Easy

Plus:
-Quite a good simulation 
-Very accessible
-Extremely high quality components
-Low counter density
-Lovely extra rules / events
-Did  mention the fantastic components?

Minus:
-Steep price (but you get an excellent quality game)
-Frankly speaking the Bulge -like the desert war- is not my cup of tea. 
-Replay value is limited .Strict army borders / SS units restrictions first tun make it realistic but no alternative setup / scenario here. The expansion provides new possibilities though but you will have to buy it separately.

Actually I am not a fan at all of the 'Bulge'. I am always fustrated that my few quality units can cause the front to dent, only to be washed away by swarms of allied divisions after a week of giving everything.

Nevertheless, if a game manages to convince me to play and buy a Bulge game, Bitter Woods succeede as it is not only a fantastic quality product, it is very manageable and just the right amounts of rules. Playable in one evening.

Great old school hex and counter given a modern look and a true labour of love. L2 finest.

You can tell a lot of effort went into the game and the components are top-notch. It is a very clean game, but it just did not seem like the Bulge, nor did it feel like a WWII battle.

The basic game rules are very easy, almost suitable for an introductory wargame.  Yet the combat results table (CRT) and the optional rules add enough flavor and detail to make this a very interesting game.  The graphics are exceptional.  Like most Battle of the Bulge games, it covers only the period of the German offensive, but there is an expansion availabe that allows for the Allied counterattack to reduce the Bulge.

This rating could go up if repeat play shows that it produces tight, balanced results.

RATING: 7
Fun, replayable Bulge game.  Plays pretty fast, and has a lot of the same attention to terrain so crucial to Ardennes '44 (a game that included many mechanisms seen in DBW).  Seems to open up a little easier for the Germans than A'44, but the Allied counterattack is more favorable in compensation.  After some familiarity with the game, the tournament scenario should be completed in four hours (a big plus).  Includes many scenarios (unlike A'44, which only has scenarios abbreviated from the full game.)  Impressive-looking game, too.

This is an excellent, well-balanced nail-biter of a hex and counter wargame.  The system includes many details ranging from Monschau artillery restrictions to Angriff attacks, but never feels fiddly.  The L2 edition (I haven't seen any others), has beautiful counters and a nice stiff map.  The rules are crisp, unambiguous, well presented, and easy to comprehend though it takes a few playings before some of the implications become apparent.  The game includes two tense tournament scenarios playable in two-three hours with some experience, a long campaign game for true grognards, and several historical scenarios.  

The game is well-supported at its CSW forum and the designer will often graciously answer e-mails personally within just a few hours!

RATING: 8
Another...urh..Bulge game.  This one with updated, and indeed impressive, graphics.  The designer also has an (3rd) edition by himself and the counters made by Rich Ogata for the German Army is shinning purple. Heard that certain dice rolls are critical at times, leading to a "big-show" at a particular point in the game.  While the combat results table is a standard stuff, there are many special features in the game.  This edition comes with an enlarged mapboard and counters, making gameplay real easy.  The map, while using standard terrain symbols, does indicate results of extensive topography research.  The counters are professionally rendered with 'tanks' silhouttes of every type.  The use of tanks and mechanized units is more emphasized as there are many special rules to account for them.  The combined arms doctrine is also simulated by shifting a column in favour of the attacker if the attack is coordianted with infantry and arty. Leaders are also featured on the counters, with "influence" rating on their combat units.  The leaders are finally given their credit due on the battle.  This game contains all the classic units, from infantry to panzergrenedier, from artillery to armor, from glider to paratroopers.  All are here like a standard textbook.  The use of reserve is particular important for expoliting the potential hole punched through the enemy.  Otherwise, its sequence of play is the standard I-go-U-go. I like the classic feel in here, plus a wealth of historical information with which you can compare against with while you play.  The rules are top-notch in a high clarity fashion.  The endurance rating comparison is a unique touch on both sides' troop quality, whereas a DRM would be given to the side with a higher endurance rating of the units particpating in the combat.  Very effective modeling.  There are also  extensive rules on artillery.  There are tournament scenarios, very suitable for an afternoon play.  These scenarios can be played and completed under 6 hours.  There are many optional and variant rules, in fact, highest number of that I have ever seen.  They are largely expansions on the core rules and be sure to check them often during play.  The only minus is that they apread among different rule sections and apply to specific turn or turns only.  So you have to remember them quite well to maximise them to your side advantages.  Check out the annotated sequence of play on this page for a good overview.  It would solve the problem.  Overall, this game is really a labor of love that is designed with every intention that it is meant to be played and not just for looking.  Given also the physical components of this game, I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in looking for a fine wargame.

The price of US$70 is ridiculous considering what you get and the quality of the components is highly overrated. The standard GMT fair gives you the same quality and twice the components for half the price.

This is the final touch game of Battle Of The Bulge. For all those Battle of The Bulge enthusiasts who have played this well known historic battle under different game names from different publishers, look no further than this. Nice mapboard, better graphics, far better advanced & developed rules in many respects. I maybe a big fan of divisional & corps level games & rarely do I play regimental level games, but this is one exception where i do play & enjoy this level of games. Playing this game with optional rules & with the expansion set makes it totally one of the best  leading games in the market for the Battle Of The Bulge enthusiasts. This game is far better balanced in terms of playing the campaign or the alternative scenarios.  It's worth keeping it in your collection.

A fun game with easy mechanics and interesting chrome. Feels like just the right amount of detail, with the map and force pools creating the unique situation. It's a game of maneuver and not head-to-head combat.  Make sure to guard the critical villages as the US in the early game, even if it's just one unit, as once the Germans clear a path it can be difficult to plug the hole.  Game components are top notch.

Best balance of paybility and historical realism of any game I have played on Battle of the Bulge, and I have played almost every one there is. Only 2 or 3 others match it for historical accuracy and none are as playable, One of best wargame designs I have tried. Have owned and played evey professionaly published version of it from its initial release. This production is the masterpeice.. the best of the lot. The subject, for which so much is noneand written,is the only thing keepinig it from being a 10.

Gorgeous map and easy to play game (but still offering a wide range of tough choices) that captures the essence of the Bulge without getting bogged down by too much chrome that doesn't add anything to playability (e.g. A44). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decent game but maybe a bit overrated and is not likely to be played much now with Simonitch's Ardennes '44 which makes it obsolete imo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Components look great & it's easy to learn, but play was lacking in all respects for me.  I'd play Iron Tide or Ardennes '44 anyday before this.

If you want a game that is a chess-like experience in the Bulge this is perfect, but beyond that it does not feel like a Ardennes simulation to me.  I can see how this is popular in tournaments especially if you sit around ahead of time and game out every move and countermove to some level of perfection, but this is the one Bulge game where one poor turn will literally doom the rest of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Physically this is an impressive Bulge game, on par with Ardennes '44 graphically although with a different style.  However game play is fairly restrictive with numerous special rules and provisos...the game mechanics are not much different from any number of previous Bulge games, especially the Last Victory.  This game feels like a (very good) 5th edition, tried and true but also a little tired.  The end result is a good game but one that over-estimates the chances of a German break out.

One of the "Greats" and will probably never die out. Balanced to a razors edge for the opponents -- one simply cannot goof a single move against a good opponent. The campaign game is a refreshing surprise after continued play of the shorter scenarios. Will be playing this one in tournament at Prezcon 2014.

RATING: 5
The game components are very nice, nothing to complain about here. The game though is not really a simulation of the Bulge imho. The Germans in my plays (4) almost lost no units during the first 6-8 turns as there is almost no attrition in the combat results....that makes for a very boring game for the American since he can just react,( actually he can only die...) The rules for the German Nebelwerfer units are plain wrong since they are are only given a range of one hex....most of the rockets calibers could fire up to between 3-4 km  wich amounts to 2 hexes...(the Nebelwerfer units in the Ardennes where to about 80% equipped with the higher range calibers. Source: Hermann Jung "Die Ardennenoffensive 1944/45" Muster-Schmidt Verlag, a ecxelent source of data if you can read German).
Its a nice game but thats it...so if you are looking for a good Bulge simulation this is not it.
And if your looking for a bulge game the Gamers "Ardennes" is the better one imho.

Best: many optional combat rules make the game grows up (use all of them).
Worst: Artillery´s influence in combat seems excessive (support factors add to the combat without any limit for both sides). Maybe is lacking a short of coordination rule, as in Von Borries games?...

I haven't yet played this enough to offer good comments yet, but it is undoubtably one of the best one day plays for a Bulge game out there. 

I find I've blown through in the center of the board so deeply the US can't recover well enough to hold fast, and in fact, so deep I don't have enough to hold my own flanks, when I'm playing the German. 

I suspect it will take me at least another dozen plays to become adept enough to offer more constructive criticism, but for now, this is my #2 favorite Bulge title of this scale.

This is hands-down my favourite WWII game, and IMO the best Bulge game available. An elegant simulation that's very eye-pleasing and intuitive. A joy to play thanks to extremely well-written rules (expansion rules with colour examples) and fluid, flawless mechanics. The beautiful, jumbo-sized cardboard map gives it the appearance of a monster game, but it can be played in an afternoon. The basic rules will get you playing almost immediately, and the advanced/optional rules and game variants can be integrated (as many or as few as you like) with no extra weight to complexity (I especially like the random events). It's these extras that keep this game so immensely re-playable and on my game table more than any other WWII game. The expansion is extra icing on the cake!

Best Bulge game in its scale. Superb graphics and quick tournament level play make this a must own if at all interested in the battle. Doesn't artificially limit German attack capability by denying more than two divisions on the attack. Reflects Allied artillery capability better than any other Bulge game, while recognizing the mobility and firepower of German neblewerfer units. The expansion set adds additional color and scenario options to the game. Overall, well worth the investment.

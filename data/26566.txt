Nothing new but plenty of options and a relatively steep learning curve in terms of buildings will help to repeated plays. I like it more than I probably should these days as it is probably a bit too 'dry' for my current tastes plus the graphics and components are pretty poor (I have 1st edition)

One of my favorite games right now.  Everyone who I've taught it to has liked it as well.  It is very simple, and can play very fast.  The only shortfall is the risk of AP while selecting buildings.  A very fun game, I can't imagine turning a game of this one down.

RATING: 6
2 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: Engine building. Neat theme. Passing on an auction still gives a player something in return.

DISLIKE: Knowing the buildings in advance helps tremendously, so this hinders first time players a bit. Could use a player aid for the tech tree. Lots of little parts scattered everywhere. Can be hard to slow down the leader. 

OVERALL: I had high hopes, but I didn't feel a lot of the fun tension I like to feel in an auction game. The auction, which is over half the game, was fun in the beginning but felt a bit scripted towards the end. This is a game that needs a few plays to understand the building tech tree.

This is a game with lots of exchange formulas to manage... 2 apples = 1 lead, 1 lead and 1 horse = ...etc and you have to play those exchanges. Translation... there's nothing new to enjoy here. It's not a bad game... I've just already purchased this formula too many times.

[u]First impressions[/u] (2p, 8/26/17): Fun enough little 2p engine-builder. It's a race to the VP finish, without a lot of tension between the players besides "how can I get those points"? Interaction is largely nil. With two players, the auction is a little flat, other than the possible competition for who wins Auction 1 and control of the Start Player privilege; the N-1 reward for construction permits is missing, although the neutral player-robot does serve to inflate the market cost at times. More often, though, the options between auctions are not different enough to force any real bidding competition. This won't be a good game to introduce to new players -- the variety of choices among the building actions, and the absence of any sort of clear way forward to achieve some end goal, make strategies completely opaque at first blush; new players will have no idea how to proceed. At 10 rounds, it plays pretty quickly (about 1h), which is a plus. Since it seems only okay as a worker placement/resource conversion game, and kind of anemic as an auction game, we might tire of this quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very constrained auction/engine building game, you really can't get much done during the 10 rounds so you need to pick your path carefully and get as much as you can before anyone else. Love the auction mechanic (a la Amun-Re / Vegas Showdown) and love the little wooden meeples. Would like to play more to see how much depth is there, quite obscure to see the optimal paths at first but will it become clearer?

I like this one!  Auction mechanic for building buildings to implement/further your engine.  Someone will be left out, but they get a cool consolation prize.  And everyone has to rotate through that.  The engine is kinda cool since it's variable among the constituent buildings.  The end-game buildings are all the same, but which one(s) are for you will differ.  Replay value is slightly diminished but I don't care.  It's a good game.

I LOVE the bits in this game.  Cow meeples are absolutely awesome.  I don't like that you can be forced to pass in an auction, because the penalty for passing to me seems too great.  Pass too many times early and you dig a ditch that's hard to recover from. Theme is awesome tho.

I began designing Homesteaders in early 2006, and am thrilled to see it get published.  

Homesteaders is an economic, resource management game, with an auction element and a variety of buildings that players can construct to provide income, resource production, points, trading power, and various special powers.  

It combines building resource costs with an auction/monetary element in a unique way.  The construction of a building requires both the collection of the appropriate resources through trade or production, and the winning of an auction for the appropriate type of land for that building type. 

Players need to develop both resource production of important materials such as Steel and Copper, to be able to build buildings, and monetary income, to be able to win auctions.

The game contains a variety of strategic paths to victory, and should appeal greatly to lovers of economic development games!

Homesteaders plays in 60/75 minutes for a 3/4 player game with experienced players.  Add 15-30 minutes for newer players.

Pure auction games are not really my thing, but I like Homesteaders quite a bit. I like all the different abilities on the buildings and spend most of the game thinking about how to capitalize upon my tableau, workers, and resource market. 

The auctions are much more structured and quick than a lot of other auction focused games. And 'losing' the auctions isn't necessarily a bad thing since you advance on the railroad benefit track.

I'll certainly need to play this with more than two. The mechanism for getting players to drop out of bidding was nice, but not enough of a deterrent, I feel.

There are a lot of neat things here, but it still really feels just like a "turn A into B into C into points". I don't mind those sorts of games per se (Le Havre), but I typically like them to be less overt than this (and Glen More).

The components are great and there are interesting elements to the auctions, though.

Ελαφρύ οικονομικό παιχνίδι με πλειστηριασμούς και resource management στην Αμερική του 1860. Το θέμα του βασίζεται στον Homestead νόμο που υπόγραψε ο Αβραάμ Λίνκολν και έδωσε έναυσμα στους πολίτες να μετακινηθούν προς το εσωτερικό της χώρας και να διεκδικήσουν γη για τον εαυτό τους με τον όρο όμως να την καλλιεργούν. Ενδιαφέροντα όλα αυτά όμως ας εστιάσω στους μηχανισμούς.

Το βασικότερο κομμάτι είναι ο αρχικός πλειστηριασμός για τις οικοδομικές άδειες, που γίνεται στην αρχή κάθε γύρου. Μόλις κερδίζεις την άδεια μπορείς να χτίσεις στο χωριό σου ένα νέο κτήριο της αντίστοιχης κατηγορίας. Έτσι σταδιακά αυξάνεις σιγά-σιγά την παραγωγή σου (υπάρχουν 5-6 resources) ενώ μου άρεσε και ο μηχανισμός στο marketplace που έχει ένα κόφτη και δεν μπορείς να κάνεις όσες συναλλαγές θέλεις. Ο κάθε παίκτης έχει τους εργάτες του και τους στέλνει να δουλέψουν στα κτήρια του. Πρέπει όμως και να τους πληρώνεις.

Γενικά οι κανόνες είναι απλοί αλλά το gameplay είναι αρκετά σφιχτό, τα χρήματα είναι λίγα (υπάρχουν και δάνεια βέβαια) οι γύροι είναι λίγοι. Λογική διάρκεια παιχνιδιού γύρω στη μιάμιση ώρα. Πολύ καλή ποιότητα παραγωγής.

Συνήθως δε μου πολύ-αρέσουν τα light-medium eurogames γιατί με αφήνουν στο τέλος να θέλω το κάτι παραπάνω. Το Homesteaders όμως ήταν χορταστικό.

This isn't a bad game.  It's just not a great game, in my mind.  IMO, there are far too many resources and too much setup/takedown for the game's length.  I like simple games with a lot of strategy, which this is.  I like auction/bidding games, which this is.  I like worker placement, which this has.  There's just nothing overly special about the game, though.  I will say that I could see it being a perfect fit for some.  It is a decent game of strategy that is relatively simple and straightforward (aside from needing to learn the nuances of the tile interactions), with quick turns and short overall game times.  There is something to be said for that.

Too many different cards/building to decide about before making a bid. Intensive plays will give you better insights in combos/synergies. Problem is that I play this too rarely. If I don't play this at least once every 3 week, I'll forget the interesting combos and need to relearn the combos.

Update.  Although not yet played again, am now wondering what thread I should have followed to play better.  Would like to play again.  Sigh.

Not a bad game,  but some limitations that will stop me playing again (probably). 1) Very hard to read card text with my aging eyes (esp from the far side of the table), 2) Too many choices -  might improve with experience, but the decision trees are very wide, and there are so many ways to convert one thing into another that any player suffering from AP is going to kill the game stone dead. 3) Slightly too long - trimming it by 30 mins would improve it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Homesteaders combines a prominent auction mechanic with an equally prominent engine-building mechanic, which is especially important in holding the interest of novice players (In general, I find auction games to take several games to value properly and many gamers will lose interest before that happens). Furthermore, the goods/resources in this game are quite liquid, allowing for a variety of different strategies and interesting decisions. And because of its nearly deterministic development, this game can quickly become brain-burning as players are able to calculate their decisions multiple turns ahead. 

If I had to make any criticism of the game, I would say it would benefit from different scenarios/buildings. But even considering that, there is something incredibly rich and unique about this game. Combine that with the outstanding components in the 2nd-edition, you have something that will remain in my shelf for a long time.

Nekem úgy lett beharangozva, hogy Caylus szintű játék. Hát nem az... Bonyolultságra közelíti, de sok újat nem találtam benne (a legfontosabb rész a licitmechanizmus, na az pl. Amun-reből van apró módosítással). Szerintem az egész úgy ahogy van, nem elég letisztult, a piacolgatás kicsit erőltetett, a végén simán lehetne mondani hogy minden megmaradt kereskedő jelző 1 pontot ér, ehelyett 5 percig váltogathatja az ember a dolgait, mire kioptimalizálja, de végül nagyjából ugyanott vagyunk. A tábla kivitel elég gagyi (legalábbis az első kiadásé). És mindezek ellenére mégis azt mondom, hogy tetszik, csak nem szabad a Caylushoz hasonlítani...

Helyesbítek: a végén minden kereskedő jelző (csak) legalább fél pontot ér, ha van 1 pénzünk... Illetve ha nyersanyagaink is vannak, akkor mindegyik egy-egy pontra váltható a ker. jelzőkkel...

Based on my false assumptions of the designer, I was expecting Homesteaders to feature similar mechanics to Puerto Rico.  Well, it turns out that Homesteaders feels more like a cross between Vegas Showdown and Gates of Loyang.  For example, Homesteader's buying and selling at the market is very similar to Loyang and the bidding for tiles is basically a Vegas Showdown style auction.  In terms of complexity, Homesteaders is in the same range as Puerto Rico or Loyang, whereas Vegas is a much simpler game.     

The artwork for Homesteaders is great, but the production quality is extremely hit or miss. The copy I played with had a lot of cardboard components cut waaay to the left or the right of the intended border.  Extremely poor marks for the printing job.  However, the wooden components are great.  I like the look and feel of the cows, apples, cowboys, etc.  One of the cowboy components was missing a leg, but that didn't bother me at all.  I actually selected him as my starting dude.

I like this game.  It has interesting wood bits and it plays well.  There is a lot of action and struggle for resources.  The blind resource, points, and money is an interesting mechanic.  It creates a sort of meta game.  It was frustrating for me to not know where I stood at any point during the game.  Otherwise, its a pretty cool game.  One major thing I would say about Homesteaders is this: it is very similar mechanically to Princes of Florence, in a way it is a more tame version.

This was one of those economic games that I say, "the second game will be much more awesome."  Very true of this one.

What I liked was it was very much a dry euro economic game, but it still had enough flavor to keep things interesting.  Normally the dry euro games with just numbers on the cards gives you a feeling of tuning an economic engine turn after turn.  This, however, had a gambit feel like le havre does.

I liken it to a more flavorful saint petersburg with a nifty bidding mechanic to it.  I don't want to give a rating because I think I really got the intricacies of it only about halfway through.

The bits were top-notch.

First play was fun though I think we were more focused on the conversation than the play (I do enjoy it when a game is social).  I'd like to try it again to see how it goes as I felt like I ended up well mostly by avoiding paying too much for the auctions.  Second game was with three players and very tight.  I misunderstood how debts worked, thinking each debt was worth -1, -3, -6.  Not sure how much that cost me but my last 2 turns would have been played different.  I doubt that I would have won as I ran into some other issues as well.  This game is quite good.

Interesting game.  It has most all of the play of a medium euro bid/resource/build game, but inexplicably plays in about an hour.

Somewhat unengaging resource conversion WP and auction game.  The auction is, more or less, the entire game.  As you build, you find synergies in your buildings to score points.

While I'm a big fan of euros -- mixed on auctions -- Homesteaders did nothing for me.  The resource conversion was run of the mill, the auctions were fine but not all that exciting, and the sense of accomplishment in each turn was minimal.  Every round felt rote.  

Worst of all, if you either intentionally passed or had to bow out of the auction, you did nothing; your turn was a bore.

For auctions, give me Container.  For an auction included in other mechanisms, I'll take Tramways or AoS, ROTW, etc.  For auctions and worker placement, Keyflower.

Homesteaders just doesn't bring anything new to the table.

Once you sort of internalize the buildings, and what goes together, I bet this gets really good. For now, everyone kind of bids up things they think might be good, and just sees where they land.

I really liked Homesteaders at first and I still do.  It's relatively short and packs a lot of the same punch as Puerto Rico and other optimization games and wraps it in a clean package.  It's like the exact opposite of Le Havre which seemed to glorify in ever more resources and ways to convert those into other resources.

However, it bothers me that the entire "game" here consists of 10 auctions.  Everything else consists of fiddling with resources and buildings.  Exacerbating this feeling is that something is slightly off about the auctions.  I think it boils down to money being too tight and the buildings not feeding back into the auction.  Here you are agonizing about paying one silver more and yet it's not entirely clear what the premium is over the other action.  I mean towards the end of the game it's a little clearer, but then it also becomes really calculating as you can determine exactly what each building is worth to you.

Overall, the auctions never reach the same tension as say Princes of Florence, Goa or Amun Re; all games with a lot of fiddling around between the meat of the game the auctions.  Except in those cases your tableau informs your decisions.  I think it was a mistake to make the items up for auction the ability to buy any building of a type and then flood the game with lots of auction items with multiple building types.  Not infrequently the items up for bid are basically indistinguishable.

Bottomline: Not quite developed enough to reach the pinnacle of boardgaming.

I don't use to like games in which almost the whole game is about "I change this for that combined with those to get this to later combine with that to get 1 VP".

I'll pass on this.

A game of economics and cut-throat auctions (one fewer than the number of players, like Evo).  Lots of things that you want to do, but not enough time to do everything.  Most buildings have special powers, and you want to build buildings that work synergistically.  As with many games, the first 50-75% of the game focuses on creating an economic engine (for money and resources) and the last 25% is focused on earning victory points.  There is a moderate learning curve because each building has a different power, and on turn 9 of 10 all of the buildings with income disappear and are replaced by victory point buildings.

For strategy of this game go to
(a) https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/500384/general-strategy-guide
3 priorities in the early game, you need to build your income/resource engine by
1) Bid for and construct building that provide resources - get one building that can produce Gold, Copper, or Livestock
2) Get an automatic income from the building or with workers later in mid-game Good income building (Rodeo, Bank, Gold Mine, and Fairgrounds) or you can use the rail lines
3) Get a source of trade tokens/trade chits

Mid-game
Look for ways to score points.  Pass in the town phase to have resources to bid in the City Phase

Late Game
Maximum bid of $21 can occur

In auction, you do not want a player to gain something for a very low bid.


Set the Auction board, (a) Workers, (b) Silver, (c) Trade, (d) Rail Line, and (e) Point Chits on the board.
Each player receives a player screen, 1 worker, and 6 silver.
Each player places a player marker on the start of the Railroad Development track.  Use the other marker for bidding.

Set Auction pile into three piles on the Auction board.  Order the Auction Tile and place them FACE-UP.
Sort out the 10 Auction 2 tiles. Shuffle the TWO CITIES and place them face down.
For 4 players create the 3rd Auction tiles.
For 2 or 3 players game remove the auction 3 tiles.
Sort building - Settlement and Settlement/Building, next are the Residential, Industrial, and Commercial denoted by the colors Green, Blue, and Orang.  Then 'Town ' and 'City'
Set up for 2 player - include only one of each building in the game (except 2 of FARM, MARKET, and FOUNDRY).
Choose a starting player.

Tiles anatomy - Name, Type, Stage (which will determine the tile availability), VIctory Point Value, Cost (to acquire/construct/build), and Ability/Bonus/Additional Score.
The bottom Icons represent Automatic Income which will be provided/acquired/received/gained during INCOME PHASE.  Worker Income, require to have a Worker present to generate the income.

ROUND PHASES
(1) Set-up
(2) Income
     (a) Allocate workers (assign workers/place workers)
     (b) Collect income (gain income) - collect all automatic income and income generated by workers.
     (c) Pay workers - pay 1 silver to the workers*
         *Players can take Debt to pay workers.
(3) Auction
     (a) Bidding - Player may make a bid regardless of the CASH AT HAND.  This seems to be an interesting rule as compared to other bidding game. In Homesteader, players can make a re-bid on the same auction track unlike Amun-Re, Cyclades and Stockpile where players have to move onto another track.
Whenever players pass, each of these players adance their marker on the Railrooad Development Track.  This is a built-in balancing mechanism which will award players who have passed items.  Auction tile that receive no bid will be discarded. 

2 player bidding - place a neutral token; each player place a neutral token.  Neutral bid token always being at '5'.  If both players win an item in Round 1, the neutral bid will increase a level to 6.  Neutral bid token can never go further than '9'.  Whenever a player passes, decrease the neutral bid token by 1.

     (b) Building - player pay for the auction and may build a building of the type listed on the auction tile.  Player can use the Marketplace, spend Gold or take Debt to pay for auction.  Because of game allowing players to take Debt, players can bid regardless of the cash at hand.


Note to Self (as the game progress)
Set up - players retrieve bid markers and reveal top tiles of face down auction piles.
Round 5 - Settlement stage is over.  Town stage begins.  Remove unbuilt Settlement buildings.
Whoever win the Auction on Space #1 get to be the starting player.
If you end on the 5th space of the Railroad Development track, gain any reward of your choice indicated on the track.

Round 9 - Town stage is over.  City stage begins.  Remove unbuilt Town stage buildings.
Allocate workers - assign workers to the building you (similar to 51st State New Era but in 51st state, you can place workers on another player building and the worker placement action is not simultaneous)**
**We can see if whenever a game allow players to assign workers to their own building, it is possible to such actions to be taken by each player simultaneously in order to save time.

After the 10th Round, there is a Final Income and Scoring
Players repeat the Income phase, use the Marketplace in order to pay off Debt or convert the Trade chits, Silver, and resources into VPs.

Calculate score:
Victory Point chits
Point values of building
Point values of bonuses
2 VPs for each Gold, Livestock, and Copper
Debt chits, paid off for 5 silver
Lost of point for each Debt a worker has -1, -2, -3, .....  Negative points are accumulated. 5 Debt chits will be -15.
In case of tied, players with most Silvers win.

Additional Rule:
Spending Gold - gold can be used as 5 silver but no change is given. :(


GAME DESIGN THOUGHTS
Trade Chits - make business transaction - can allow players to go to Marketplace.
(a) Recruit a worker - 1 Trade Chit and 1 Food
(b) Buy Resource - buy according the going rate
(c) Sell Resource - receive 1 point for selling resource in the Marketplace
Thoughts on the game design.  Why I like this worker placement game better than the most recent ones that appear in the market.
1 Debt chit provide 2 Silver

A game of resource conversion where you build your conversion strategy through 'buildings'. It's a nice balance between bidding and engine building. But nothing you haven't seen in other games: Resources during income phase, use resources to buy conversion cards, convert resources in other resources and victory points. After 10 rounds count victory points to declare a winner.

It's executed well, but the game is a pretty abstract euro affair. The cowboy headed meeples and apple shaped food pieces are cute, but the tacked on Western theme never feels like it.

I like the game, though it took a second play before it rubbed of on me. The bidding phase is very important and being an auction, always a bit unpredictable. That means you have to be flexible because it's hard to create your optimal conversion engine. That should add a lot to longevity. It's hard for first time players because the buildings available in the end phase are so important and you won't know which resources to have by then.

Heard a lot about this game, and since it's so inexpensive I figured that it's likely worth a go.

After a couple of plays I'm not feeling the love of this game.  By three plays I should have something making me want to come back for more, and I'm really not getting that from Homesteaders.  I can see wanting to figure the game out, but not in the same way as other titles I have.  I won't get rid of it, but it's not going to see regular table time.

May 24, 2011 -- I finally played a couple of games of this that gave me a glimpse at the brilliance of the design.  A dramatic increase in my rating, and I'm looking forward to exploring the game in depth with more plays!

With 3 trained players this could be gamed in around 75 minutes, which includes setup of the board. Tough decisions during the auction has to be made and 10 rounds of a building game, where you have to find (bid & buy) your ideal straight to print money and victory points.

This game is hard to rate after one play.  I don't know if more plays would make the rating go up or down.  I can see it going either way.

It took me a few rounds to really get the knack of the trading tile, so I fell behind early.  But yet I'm concerned that having the same buildings may make it formulaic pretty quickly.

So it's interesting, but not sure how interesting.

One play. Nicely done auction game, where plenty of choices are available to develop, yet not too overwhelming. I like the flexibility with the trading to get things you need. Ten rounds of bidding/buying means players have to get the resources in a timely manner, but the system of collecting is fairly straightforward. The challenge is for players to  stay focused on purchasing and also bidding efficiently on  what is needed to develop that homestead.

Quick gameplay (1 hour long tops) with interesting choices. After just 1 play it is a 9, but could fall to an 8 because it can be a bit repetitive after several plays due to the amount of buildings. Components are normal. Both suitable for casual and non-casual gamers. Need to try with the new rules for 2. I see an expansion in the horizon with more buildings and the possibility to include a 5th player.

Surprisingly brain burning for a game where the only mechanism is 10 auctions (Evo/Amun Re style).

There is nothing new here. Just ten decisions on how much to bid on which buildings. Homesteaders doesn't offer anything that isn't already out there. As a result, it is somewhat derivative.

However, it does seem to come together well. There is a lot of angst and tension as the game feels very very tight.

Would consider an occasional play.

As for the components, the resourceeples are well done. But the cardboard, box, tiles and game board are as bad as any game I can recall.

Thought this was a very good rendition of the roads & boats / le havre / agricola development type theme. It was fairly quick with minimal downtime, with the biggest problem being the time required to interact with the banker for all of the little transactions (it must be more annoying for the banker!).

A very streamlined game.  Because it's shorter than those other development games, every turn counts and efficiency is key.  The bidding is also very important too, as you can waste a lot of money getting into bidding wars.

This is one tight, tough little Euro.  This is one of those games that is all about conversions, and trying to change things into VPs the most efficiently.  The main innovation it offers is the concept of "trade chits."  Basically, there is a market in the game that can be utilized at any time, to convert silver to goods and goods to silver (and some goods to other goods).  The problem, though, is that to access this market, you must use a trade chit, which are collected from buildings, like other resources.  So if you want to convert an apple to silver, and then the silver to wood... you need two trade chits.  This open-but-restricted approach is brilliant, and adds a layer of analysis on top of the normal VP conversion analysis.  Plus, you can take out loans!  This makes for a system where you can do most anything, at most any time, if you've collected your trade chits and have the money (or will) to pay for it.

The other high point of the game is the auction system.  Because it works on a fixed set of bets, and because the person who wins no auction gets to take a favor (on a track with increasing payoff, like Caylus), AND because what is being auctioned is semi-random and restricted, there is much to figure.  All of this also makes for an auction that works very well with 2 players (by way of a minor addition via a variant).  Yes, my copy of the game is misprinted, mispunched, and semi-moldy, but I say this just adds to the old West feel!  Really, even with these production issues, I highly recommend this game - it travels a well-worn path, but feels completely fresh, plays fairly fast, and burns!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fast, simple Euro with a rare auction system that works very well with two. There are so many kinds of resources that knowing what to do at the beginning of the game can be daunting. What I like about it is that even if you choose a different initial route than your opponents, you will still be competing for the same buildings later in the game, as the available resources change and become more valuable later on. I do think the "Instant VP" buildings are the most powerful to get, especially if you can snag one relatively early in the game, but I suppose more experienced players knowing this would hike up the prices enough to balance things out for those who didn't get them. The two-player "dummy auction" works very well.

Very good auction driven game with an Old West theme where player is building a city by buying via auction different types of buildings that your workers can activated for different resources.  These can then be converted to either VP/Money/Other resources via trade tokens(you must use a trade token for each transaction).  Surprisingly short in length and although the buildings that become available to bid on are somewhat scripted,  the auction mechanic makes for very unpredictable results. Underrated.

This is a great game I can see playing for a long time. Nothing startlingly new, but everything fits together very well. N-1 auctions where the odd-man out gets something progressively better. A few dozen buildings combine in lots of ways. There seem to be lots of good paths through the buildings, but probably only a few great ones. Since you can take an infinite amount of debt, evaluating correctly at auction is critical. The 2nd edition seems to have addressed all of the component issues.

First impressions are that this is a decent gamers' game, if a little on the dry side for my taste - while the setting is western the theming doesn't really go much deeper than that - though, to its credit, it's not yet another medieval/renaissance europe city building exercise.  

Further plays may well reveal greater subtleties and a better knowledge of the available buildings would help there and in speeding up play - as with all games with special powers/cards/buildings, you really need to know them and the basic interactions for the game to crank up to a decent speed.

RATING: 8
6 plays in - not bad - and I still rather like Homesteaders. But I'm developing a couple points of unease.

Firstly is the obvious AP problem. Several elements of the game are very fiddly, and there is substantial risk of player bog-down. Homesteaders is great at 60-75 minutes but definitely does not want to run two hours, which it has the potential to run. As we've played more, our games seem to have gotten progressively longer.

Secondly is the endgame. After the first 8 tense, action-packed turns, the last two seem incredibly unedifying. The costs and values of everything up for auction are pretty specifically calculable. It's not clear to me that the last auctions add any significant value at all to the game, in fact, other than tacking on 20+ minutes of calculation and shuffling around resources. Everyone knows exactly how much everything is worth to everyone and can run all the numbers, to the point that players are going to separate by maybe a point or two. Obviously, if one player can afford stuff while the other can't, that's one thing, but my experience has been that once players figure out that having some debt doesn't hurt that much, severe cash shortages aren't that common and it's just a numbers game. Everything you've done up to that point makes a big difference, obviously, and playing those two turns is important. But we didn't need an extremely time-consuming auction that ends up adding little to no value.

Anyway, I like Homesteaders, and it's clever and got a lot of good bits. But at the end of the day I'm not sure this really wanted to be an auction game. There just isn't enough variance in the lots available for sale, values don't diverge much, and there is little or no uncertainty as to future value. It won't be unusual to see all the lots going for within a buck of each other each turn. Doing the auctions is very time consuming and not really that interesting. I'm not sure what a better mechanism would have been, but Homesteaders just seems to be missing some very key elements that make true auction games work. 
---
4 players seems like the better and more interesting game, but 3 plays faster and I think Homesteaders wants to play fast.

Homesteaders does also suffer from a very inelegant last-turn endgame. The bidding becomes very calculational and those calculations are straightforward but annoying. You've got to do a lot of combinatoric analysis to figure out how many VPs can be gotten in various ways, and the trade tokens - a very clever constraint for the midgame - become a real problem at the end, where you can play shell games to get VP. I really wish this were smoother; I'd question whether the VP for selling stuff really needs to be in the game and whether it could be abolished, it causes problems.

Anyway, this is all comparatively minor, I'm still enjoying Homesteaders. But the endgame calculation-fest does have the potential to drag the game out past its expiration date.
---
After a couple more plays, I may have sold this game a little short on my initial impressions. It is true, it gives the impression of a bit of overdesign - do we really need 6 different resource types plus workers plus debt plus trade tokens plus railway tokens plus VP chips? The 1VP you get on each sale seems particularly pointy, easy to forget, and unneeded. Some recurring building powers are also very easy to forget due to the uninspired graphic design. But Homesteaders still plays smoothly and cleanly and doesn't feel as baroque as it initially seems. Sure, there are some edges that could still be filed, but it's a first game and bearing that in mind, the complaints aren't serious.

As with all these things, when you've got a game with a lot of buildings and paths and powers, game balance is the key to replayability. Not may games have gotten this balancing act right - not Ursuppue, not Puerto Rico, not Agricola, not Le Havre - and it's honestly hard to believe that Alex and Tasty Minstrel have done it on their very first go where veteran game designers and publishers can really only reliably manage to get close. But that's in the long run. In the short run, I'm enjoying this, it plays cleanly, the options it presents are interesting and the choices not easy; but the scope of the choices is constrained enough that it doesn't overwhelm you. I think it's got a chance to be a keeper. Also importantly, it's gone over well with people I've played it with, which helps.

Another very nice feature of the game is that while it's true mistakes and inefficiency are very punishing, on the other hand the game clocks in at only an hour or so. I don't mind a game being sharp if it can be short.
---
Played once, enjoyed, would play again, but it's pretty soulless. It's almost a book-definition euro game, buy stuff to produce resources which you convert into other resources and then into victory points. Loses touch with its thematic grounding and introduces odd fiddly bits at several points (like the odd VP award for selling resources for money). Also lacks much interesting player interaction. Seems to try to emulate the tech-tree style of game which Puerto Rico is part of, but really all Homesteaders has is a tech tree, where in my heavier euros I prefer more than one element. Homesteaders seems to want to be heavy but lacks the dimensionality to actually be so.

Still, it's not that long, and despite some possibly minor complaints it seems a decent medium-plus weight game. Seems well-balanced, in that all resources are usually tight.

Problem is that by being so by-the-book, it's fighting in a design space with more imaginative games like Puerto Rico, San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, and Phoenicia, so I doubt it'll have long-term value. But first impressions are it'll be fun for a little bit. My real concern is that around here its appeal will be so narrow (given the level of intellectual work required, the learning curve, and the lack of any real thematic traction) that it'll just be too hard to get on the table. But we'll see. I found it intriguing enough to warrant another play or two, so hopefully we'll get an update.

I like engine building games, so it's no surprise that I had a decent time playing this one.

Each round players bid on the available actions, taking the action that they win.  Most actions allow you to build a building that round, thus allowing you to make more stuff or trade for other stuff that will allow you to build more buildings later on.  The buildings are also worth a number of points, with some building awarding end of game point bonuses.  The odd man out on the auctions gets a booby prize.

There are also interesting aspects mixed in, such as needing a work force of cowboys to man certain buildings, and the ability to go into debt to afford purchases (players will likely accrue a large debt to stay competitive!).

Basically, you keep on doing this until the game is over, and whoever scores the most points wins.

Overall, I enjoyed it as an economic/engine building game and thought it was different enough from others in the genre to warrant keeping around.  However, I don't see it getting frequent play as games tend to feel pretty same-y to me.

This is the same game as Vegas Showdown.  The difference being that if you win an auction, you get to choose your tile from a pile of various tiles with various powers.

This is one of the games I had heard so much good about, but when I played it (twice with different player counts), it was so disappointing. It felt sooo bland and just "trade this in for this in order to score VP" - a feature I'm usually fond of (see my ratings for most euro games; I'm a huge fan!), but in tis game it was extremely boring. This is one of those games I don't understand why people enjoy as much as they do.

Average engine building game with the interaction coming from the auction rounds. Everything else is solitaire. I liked the goods, but there seemed to be an abundance of types, nearly too much. I liked the engine building though the buildings, and the auctions were quite intense. It may get a bit repetitive based on the same buildings used every game. It's a surprisingly quick euro and a solid game.

Tried it tonight.  Opened the box to a moist game with some mold and bits that were hard to tear out.  Bummer.  The game was good, but there were times that I felt like it was a little too flexible.  When I played To Court the King, it ended up feeling like I could do most things I wanted if I spent enough time looking at all the ways to use the dice.  In this one, with all the juggling around in the marketplace and from building abilities, it felt sort of the same.  So it was good, but in some ways, a little overwhelming.

The decision tree at turn 3 or 4 made my head almost implode in an endless strange loop!  It is refreshing dealing with juicy decision tree coupled with the strategic planning in this game.  And most of the time, I would scrap my plans and do something else. I'm sure this way of thinking will even out over more plays but the first play was damn fun for me.  I really love Auction mechanics, so to add in some worker placement and an engine building system and it hits all my sweet spots.

Great worker placement, resource collecting-auction-building mechanics that come together quite nicely for a fun game.

RATING: 9
Homesteaders is one of the meatiest games I own that plays in less than an hour. In that short span of time, players progress through a rather nuanced "tech tree" of buildings, with increasingly improving abilities, until they eventually cash in on the last round of VP generating buildings. Players acquire these buildings through an "Amun-Re style" simultaneous multi-item auction, but during each auction, one player has to eventually "punt," bow out, and take a consolation prize.

The result is a very tight game, where every resource counts and almost every auction is a nail-biter. Everything just comes together so well in this game, and because the game fits so many decisions in such a reasonable time frame, I find it really tarnishes my opinion of the great number of ho-hum generic Euros out there.

My knock on Homesteaders is that it's tough on new players, as newbies will have a really tough time placing value on various different buildings. But once players have that familiarity, this game is a gem.

The auction for building types (and other special treats) is interesting, but, as expected, the core of the game - point conversion engine - doesn't appeal to me. It feels like most of the game is merely a matter of patience, inspection, and calculation. Not a lot of game for my arithmetic.

Very unlikely to climb is this clunker of an efficiency exercise. In fact, it is very unlikely to get another play. While not offensive, it is charmless. The interesting questions asked by the game are in the auction, but the answers are revealed only through a dry and rather uninteresting analysis of the various potential VP-generating contraptions of the other players. It is never a good sign when I am so bored by a problem as to not want spend the necessary energy to solve it.

09-28-2013 - This game has been played moderately since owning it, and it is a go-to for introducing board game novices to the auction mechanic.  The game remains tight, fun, and most people who have played would play again.  My total number of plays are about ten to fifteen, over the course of four years, so I am by no means an expert.  But the game does offer a nice, well-playtested experience in the time-frame advertised.  My last play of this was approximately May 2013.

The dates played are incorrect, but the number of plays are accurate.

RATING: 8
Alex Rockwell has played a lot of the recent Euro optimization games, and it shows in this design which borrows elements of Puerto Rico, Amun Re, and (Cube Transformation Game du jour).

The game is ostensibly about erecting buildings that will allow players to create resources, transmute those resources into yet other resources, so they can put up more buildings and hire more workers to man them, and so on. The action here is driven not by worker placement so much as a modified Amun Re auction where there are always X-1 items available where X is equal to the number of players. Hence, someone is always going to have to pass. What's up for the auction? The right to erect buildings.

The final package is a tight one, tough decisions in the auction abound, and creating effective building combinations is interesting. As with most of these types of games (Le Havre excepted) the game end also sneaks up much quicker than one is expecting.

This rating is tentative, and could change if the long-term replay ends up being good or if it really hooks me. As it stands, I think it's definitely in solid at its length, and that it has a nice combination of existing mechanics. Nothing truly original, but a good blend, and one that gets some extra leeway for being a good title that uses the Amun Re auction, a mechanic that I really like, but which had not been used in a game that I particularly liked before this.

On an aside, I find it rather surprising that people dog this game for its bits so much. The price of this game is peanuts relative to how many sheets of tiles are included in the box, and I think having a low price of entry is always smart for both a newer publishing house and a newly published designer. Yes, ideally it would have been nice if the die had been a little sharper, as some of the bits, like the VP chits, don't punch cleanly, but I said the same thing about my German-produced Java when I bought it.

One of my favorites.  The entire premise of the game is essentially to figure out how much a tile will be worth to you throughout the game, and therefore determine your bid for it.  Deliciously straightforward rules that get out of your way to let the game shine through.

Great auction / town building game that even plays well with two.  I like how you bid on zoning types, then choose a building of that type to build.  Available buildings come from a limited pool that changes depending on the game round.  Money can be tight in this game w/o enough buildings that give you income.  Initial rating = 8.
My only real complaint with this game is that you actually handle the super cool looking bits very infrequently during the game.  Multiple market trades of  one item for another happen regularly and then you immediately cash in those bits for a building.

Kind of Le Havre light. 
Streamlined game play. The rounds go incredibly fast and smooth.
It is easy to teach but it has enough depth to be worth several visits.
The only problem is the lack of interaction between players : it is limited to auctions. 
It is really a pure euro, only the theme is American.
The components (1.ed.) are under par when it comes to the cards and the small board but the cow and cow-boy meeples are very nice ;)
All in all, a satisfying gaming experience !

RATING: 6
Decent "buy this, to produce that, which you need to buy the other" type game. I'm not sure, though, whether the game weight really needs 5 different resources, especially when with a market everything can be bought/sold. Bidding system is exactly Amun Re / Vegas Showdown, but only players minus one tiles to auction, so someone will have to pass each time. This actually is pretty effective at keeping pressure on the prices, unlike VS where sometimes you can get something cheap if everyone is going for something different.

Yes, the components are not great, but not bad enough to really impact things too much. The board is the flimsiest I've ever seen, but what actually affected things is that on the tiles that get auctioned, in like 3 pt font are the words "and" or "or". Assuming that it's "or" (as most are) when it's "and" can make a huge difference. 

To me, the game is missing the overarching fabric that makes VS work so well. VS has things like connections between exits, filling up each side, making red squares, building down the tech tree, etc.

This is a game which presses quite a number of wrong buttons with me, the most important of which being a straightforward snowball engine which spirals very quickly out of easy control because the number of tiles with special functions is so large. It has few redeeming features to call its own: it is basically a Frankengame in the genre. Homesteaders is perfect for those who want to have a lot of options in a small package, and to play a growth engine to death, and philosophise about the intrinsic value of tiles given a a certain game state... and thus it is not for me. I prefer my options to be more constrained when it comes to this sort of game. Nice to have played, probably a good idea that it was picked up by Quined for a Masterprint edition, but not a game I need to play again in my gaming 'career'.

Solid cube conversion game, but it just didn't grab me enough to want to get repeat plats.  The components were good.  The auction worked well.  There were plenty of options on resource conversions.

Money is tight in the Wild West.  If you're afraid to get a little dirty and put in some hard work, you'll never succeed at developing a prosperous homestead.

I really enjoy this game.  I love watching my homestead grow, and I love the auction mechanic that powers the game.  Having a consolation prize in the form of the railroad track is genius.  You can try and force other players to pay more for the tiles they want, but you might get stuck paying for something that you can't afford.

The game plays quickly.  After five plays, my group had the playtime down to just under an hour (3-player).  It's perfect for getting multiple plays in a single session--which you WILL want to do, believe me.

Pleasing little economics game of growing your engine, earning money and converting to points. The engine is built by buying cards and balancing that with enough workers to run them all. Obviously your costs go up as well creating the need to carefully plan that growth.
Nothing too earth shattering or novel and makes good use of iconography. As per PR, there's a good build up to seize the big point scorers.
Unfortunately, in common with a lot of games like this, there's limited interaction between players beyond the bidding and a lot of time will be spent examining your own play area and calculating theworth of numerous options.

Homesteaders is a well structured game with plenty of choice and analysis of position throughout the ten turns.  It is, however, very dry and emotionally uninvolving, being more of an optimization puzzle with opponent driven mid-course changes required.  If one does not like valueing options for bid purposes, this will be a painful game.  Well designed and executed, but more brainy than fun.

[2013-04-03 Rating: n.a. -> 7.5]
After three plays, I feel like I can give Homesteaders a preliminary rating. This might change in the future if I can get some more plays of it in but I only expect it to rise. Having said that, here are my two cents about Alex Rockwell's debut game:

At it's core, Homesteaders is an engine building game in which the right to erect the buildings that you use to fire your engine are auctioned off. The auction-mechanism is similar to the one that is used in Amun-Re or Cyclades and the whole game lasts only ten rounds which equals to ten auction phases. As a result, you don't have a lot of time to find a combination of buildings that allows you to produce more victory points than anyone else. Screw up one or two rounds (especially against experienced opponents) and you're out of the race.

Right now, I'm still in the learning stage. Like in games like Le Havre, knowledge of the available buildings and their combinations seems to be the key to victory. I haven't managed to dive that deep into the strategic space yet and I'm mostly playing the game on a gut feeling. But from what I've seen so far, there seem to be a lot of possible and very different winning strategies.

Two things I'm not sure about yet:
[1] Although I do play Homesteaders using my gut feeling most of the time, I have a lot of AP because of all the different options the game presents to me. So be warned: If you have someone in your group who is like me, the game could be slow. I'm not so sure if this will get better or worse when I get to know the buildings and strategies better. Because of the auctions, there's always an element of uncertainty which might cause you to re-evaluate your options.

[2] I haven't really made up my mind regarding the open market. You can freely and quite easily convert one good into another, sometimes taking an intermediate step. While this opens up the decision space, it also feels a bit too unrestricted to me. In my last game, one player hoarded resources, a lot of coins and trade chips. In the end he began to buy and sell the same resources over and over again, making one point with each trade which got him around 30 points. While this is just another legitimate way to make victory points and another possible strategy, I feel like the trade should be a little more restricted. Le Havre comes to my mind here. There, you can only sell as much goods as you have space on your ships which means that you have to work a little harder for your right to pursue a trading strategy than in Homesteaders.

All in all, Homesteaders is a very fine game and I'm looking forward to explore it further.

Finally got a copy of this and played twice. It is every bit as good as I expected, and unfortunately even more limited. There simply aren't enough buildings to make for variance between sessions. 

Such a shame that expansion plans have been abandoned. This could have been a classic if it weren't for the extremely limited content in the base game.

I will be keeping my copy but don't expect to play it more than once a year. Even at that rate it may get samey...

Edit: Expansion looks like it may actually happen!

Although I was expecting something lighter, I enjoyed my first play of Homesteaders.  There are too many options for my taste, but once I started ignoring most of the options that would waste too many trade tokens, it became easier to keep myself from AP.

Homesteaders is a fairly heavy resource management auction game.  I would classify it as a thematic Euro that is catering extremely well to the BGG crowd.  It fits perfectly in the top 20 games of the BGG, and in fact, my rating of it is better than my rating for most of the top 20 BGG games.  If you like top 20 BGG games, then you should definitely try this one out.  You'll be pleasantly surprised. 

It was the first game I played of the evening, and I tried to get us to play it again at the end of the evening (but failed).  I'm looking forward to playing it again to see if my rating goes up.

The quality isn't the best but I can live with that if the game is good. The main problem is that the game is almost water damaged on arrival. Must leave it out to dry for a couple of days before you can even consider playing it.

While Homesteader's does not do a lot new, the stuff it does, it does very, very well. The game hits a lot of my buttons well, with tech trees, Vegas Showdown-style auctions, and a number of interlocking systems that show the potential for a lot of replayability. I played Homesteaders twice the day I first tried it out, and would have played it a third if my opponents had let me. Very, very nice design. 

The components aren't great, but for $26 (at Coolstuff), I am not going to complain 

Rating lowered on account of my general decline in interest in economic snowball games. This is a good one, its just not a style of game I am particularly interested in anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Players build up an economic infrastructure in the Old West.  Lean and mean economy game, played over 10 very fast turns.  Workers are assigned to building tiles, income grabbed, and workers are payed.  Tiles are then auctioned Amun-Re style, allowing the winners to build a building, and perhaps trigger some bonus options.  That's basically it.  Buildings grant all sorts of abilities, victory points, and income bonuses.  Players each have access to their own marketplace, allowing unlimited trading there (provided they have the trade tokens).  Very good design, and I like the way the developers have really tightened it up to ensure it plays out fast.  Reminiscent of Through The Ages, Puerto Rico, and a swag of others.  Only downer is the production and components looks quite cheap, apart from the painted cattle!  

Update: second edition is superb, components are wonderful.  Great auction/engine game.

RATING: 6
A good economic snowball game that usually plays in about an hour except when playing with people that are new to the game, as you'll be spending a lot of time reading the buildings to try and come up with some sort of strategy.  It's good that it plays quickly for a few reasons.  The first is that since it's a economic snowball, if you falter somewhere along the way, you may have no chance at winning, but at least you won't be stuck playing for a long time.  Secondly, there is a definite learning curve to figuring out optimal building combinations but since the time/game ratio is low, it won't take that much time to explore the various paths available.  Sometimes to me it feels so fast that I can't get done what I would like, but it's this time pressure that makes the game have tension.  The only caveat to the game is the extremely poor components (excluding the wood components).  I'm not going to focus on this however because  components can be improved with future editions or by a different publisher.  This is a good game that I can only see increasing it's score over time.  Bravo Alex.

Very neat resource management and bidding game.  The bidding is designed so somebody has to not build each turn, but they gain an extra privilage for doing so, and hopefully it means everyone else is overpaying for their ability to build.  Money is very tight in the game and has to be balanced so you don't take on to much debt.  

We played the first edition and the game components were absolutely terrible, but due to the nature of the theme, it actually was kind of cool, since it looks like it was produced in the 1800s.

I like this one a lot despite the fact that it's fairly derivative and tech tree & cube conversion games are kind of hit and miss with me.

A fairly open-ended victory point engine game. It plays fast, and there are a few design points that are especially strong. The trade chits are a great aspect, as is the simultaneous nature of a lot of the actions. The interaction seemed appropriate for one of these engine games. It's a shame the first print run was a little sub par, but overall the game is enjoyable and still worth purchasing.  

An element that I like about Homesteaders is the tactical nature that the auction spaces brings to the game. Often it's not about what you want to build, but what you can build. These games that make you make the best move available versus your absolute best move are fun to me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty decent economic game.  Efficiency engine building isn't my very favorite thing,  but I like it well enough, and the auctions are good.  

I'm not as big a fan of the debt mechanism; it is too tempting to say to oneself, "Ah, who cares about winning" and just take a bunch of debt to get what you want.  I prefer debt mechanisms where borrowing to do what you want one turn more directly limits your abilities in later turns.  

I've played a fair amount two-player, and while it's not as good for two as I had been led to believe (it's definitely better with 3 or 4), it's not bad.  In any case, my wife likes it a lot, and I don't mind it either.

This is a game that gets the balance right -- which creates an opportunity for interesting choices. We liked that the game was relatively quick in that it was played over 10 rounds. I'm not a fan of some auction games but this one worked well. (More like an allocation of what you're willing to pay -- like Stockpile -- and even if a player loses that player still wins something.some feel the components could've been better and well that maybe true we thought they were just fine and at least an average if not better than that because they were cardboard.  The design is just fine; it both complements and facilitates gameplay. (1st Ed.)

RATING: 8
New 2nd edition from Tasty Minstrel Games, with great components.  Terrific resource-management economic-engine euro that rivals Puerto Rico but features auction mechanics instead of role selection.  A very clever game design, and while potentially brainburning for AP-types, the variable strategies make it a very solid and replayable game.  The last half of the game is more heavy, but also more fun.  And best of all, it's superb with 2 players!

I thought Homesteaders was great at first but quickly soured on it and eventually moved it along because the game crosses far into the territory of "annoying resource conversion." I'm not a fan of games that are primarily about making calculations on values, and here the main thrust is doing multiple transactions per turn to turn one dollar into three and then into something else and then into 1VP. And with so many different income options and transactions in and out of the market, there's a lot of room for unintentional mistakes. I had a friend who would frequently undo things and we'd have to trust him that he was backing up all his transactions accurately. 

The auction is quite interesting and I like the way the railroad track is not a lame choice here like the equivalent is in Vegas Showdown. The buildings are of three classes and get replaced in each of the three phases of the game (settlement, town, city) which creates a sense of urgency to get a building before it goes away.

Still, in the end the game is a little bit interactive via the market but then it's an isolated calculation puzzle that everyone does behind their own screen and presents to the other players: [i]OK, here's how I did this[/i]. Most of the game was spent off on our own doing transactions in isolation and bumping into each other only as we reached for things in the cup then showing each other how we'd done what we'd done that turn, and you'd have to trust that the person did it correctly.

I was so surprised by how good this game is. The first game we played started off a bit slow as I had to refer back to the rules a couple of times, but after a few turns the game flowed well. The second game was even better. I've not yet won, and probably never will as my gaming group seems to be better at this game than me, but I still love playing this. My biggest, most pleasant surprise of 2010 so far.

There is a snowball effect (meaning if you play poorly at first, you'll have a hard time catching up later), but as I've already said, the process of playing this game is so much fun that winning does not matter nearly as much as you'd think. Any game that can keep me smiling while I'm losing deserves high praise.

Homesteaders is great resource management, VP accumulation game that breaks no new ground, but does manage to be tense and engaging, especially as the end approaches.

The rules are simple, but the gameplay is quite complex, and it all plays in about 90 min.  The first edition components are pretty cheap, and the board is thin and warps, but quite honestly everything functions well and the quality is barely noticeable.
  
Homesteaders is quite the gem, and I hope it gets the praise it deserves.

RATING: 7
Lots of nice bits, reasonable tight game play, nice auction mechanism, run away leader, and nothing we haven't seen before. Not to damn it, but there's nothing new here. Get stuff, use it to get more stuff, accumulate VPs. The worker placement meant that the player who got the extra worker first got away from us two, ending on 57 VPs to our 44 and 42 VPs. Yes, I'd play it again but outside of the auction, there's no player interaction, and once you know the buildings and the flow of the game, there's little tension. It is what it is, and there's a lot of it about.

RATING: 8.5
What elevates Homesteaders above any standard auction game or engine-builder is the interplay between the various mechanics. In particular, the auction and loan mechanics make for exciting and tense auctions, as players dig themselves into deeper and deeper holes that they hope their engines can bring them out of by the end of the game. I also enjoy the ability to either produce various kinds of resources directly, or to generate money and use trade tokens to buy the needed resources, as it allows for a multitude of different strategies.

Poorly punched--many repairs, especially to VP stars
Wooden components nice, cardboard tiles & chits--uncoated paper finish unpleasant to handle.  Print on tiles very small; print could have easily been larger.  Colors unattractive.
Instructions--for setup very poorly worded--no where is there an adequate description of the terms used.  Spent a long, long time trying to figure out how the auction & tiles were to be set up.  NOTE: I just discovered I received at lease one duplicate frame, might be missing others--notified company, no response yet.  Maybe more than one frame with tokens missing.

Fiddly setup--must sort through 91 tiles. 

Anticipated play by several.  Can't wait.

It's my kind of resource-management economic game: short and clean, with lots of variety and engine-building. The extreme flexibility with trade and debt is an innovative bonus.

Some annoyances:
* Tokens and tiles aren't all cut cleanly and are liable to tear if not punched out very carefully.
* Some tokens are printed out of alignment with the cutting.
* The manual obscures use of the Market, the hidden information and the rule against building duplication.
* The back of one of the basic buildings is wrong.
* One of the cowboy meeples is a cripple.
* The box insert is tearing.
* There's a 2nd edition that cleans up some stuff and includes 2-player rules, and I don't have it!

Update:  Now have the outstanding 2nd edition.  Great game that is now a "9".


This is a very good game.  Quite fun and it appears there are several available winning strategies.  Easy enough to learn (though the rules have some ambiguities and some unstated assumptions) but the best play for tiles is not readily apparent.  Will reward experienced players.   

In fact this game is a 9, except for the component issues.  My friends laughed when I opened the box.  The bidding board is a thin warped piece of glorified cardboard.  The player screen has helpful information but it is far too small and was damp and difficult to get to stand up (We had just played "Revolution" which is not nearly as good a game, but has much better components --including the player screens).   The tiles were a bit "damp" but okay.  The chits were mispunched but otherwise okay.  The bits (workers, food, iron, etc) were wonderful and fun and interesting though.

If they can clarify a few rules (Like explain the homestader card itself --and how the worker is placed on it the first turn) and add a few examples to the rulebook for the 2nd printing and vastly improve the bidding board and the player screens, then I will improve this to a 9.  Hopefully they will offer an "upgrade kit" to early adopters.

Homesteaders is an economic engine optimisation game. Players develop a non-descript Western town, constructing buildings in order to produce resources in order to construct more buildings in order to...

The construction permits are auctioned off, and available buildings are basically defined by the current game phase (e.g. early buildings are mostly for resource production while later ones tend to favour victory points).

I can't help but compare this to Scepter of Zavandor which is another economic snowball game I got to know recently. The economic system in homesteaders doesn't feel quite as refined although I can't put my finger on exactly what is causing this feeling. It might be the fact that Zavandor has fewer resource types. The major advantage of Homesteaders is that it plays in a fraction of the time which, overall, just about evens things out.

An engine game that makes my head hurt.  This is pure Euro stuff folks; make some stuff to make more stuff to make points.

However, the production quality on second edition is awesome, I love the different types of wooden tokens.  Also, it's worker placement without the STUPID COCKBLOCKING that ruins every other worker placement game--"What do you mean I can't build a fence this turn?  What, because Jebidiah is?  Really?"  Here, you get stuff, and your workers can work on it.  Period.

Question is, do I like this kind of game?  I put it on par with Agricola right now.  I think this has more appealing gameplay.  But Agricola has the theme and layout better realized.

It's been awhile since I've played this. Not exactly as great as I remember it. I really do love the auction mechanic- the sold of climbing scale in three auctions that can create some pretty tense and fierce bidding.  But when you get down to it, the engine of the buildings that you purchase is not all that exciting. I like the limited trade mechanic, the almost forced position to go into debt and deal with it, and the beautiful components. But it's just not all that exciting and the buildings are a little too simple to really get overly intrigued about how they are all going to work together. Simply put, there are much better auction games out there and I can't imagine recommending this one over some others.  So yeah- good game, but it's been overshadowed a number of times.

Second try in Myrtle Beach with Mike, Barb, Phil and I on Xmas eve 2013 results in a dramatic lowering of the rating! Poorly written rules!! Game designers need to take a course on how to write a rulebook. You know, at the beginning Object of the game!! HOW TO WIN, WHERE TO GET POINTS FROM, etc. instead of just leaving the new player with no clue of how to begin, how to move up, how to acquire points etc. etc. ad infinitum!!

The only real interesting thing in this game was the auction mechanics. Otherwise it is generally an acquire this building to be able to gain this advantage and collect this type of good to get a better building and so on. This is the type of game I'm moving away from, but I can see why I've heard good things about it. Not a bad game, just not innovative or exciting at all. I liked the old west theme.

A very well designed auction game that offers a lot of choices and options during its gameplay. Seems to be pretty limited at first sight but after a while you realize how many different things you have to take in account and the game reveals itself as one of the best auction designs in the market. Works very weel with three and four players although with four it is a bit prone to AP issues. Components in the first edition were not optimal but this has been corrected in the second and third editions. All in all a fantastic auction game, with interaction and really good replayability value.

Take Le Havre and pull a little back on the scale and time needed to play. Throw in an auction each round. Reserve building use for the player who purchased it. 

Keep: Loads of different resource types. Many paths to victory (maybe more than Le Havre?). A very openended game with lots of options on your turn. The building of a resource/income/vp engine. Productivity definitely builds as the game progresses (slightly more here than Le Havre).

Wow. I like it. I love being able to craft my own little Homestead to meet my needs/desires. I love looking for buildings that combo well. I love manipulating the resources so that I can do what I want. I enjoy competition with my opponents over the right to build. Can be a little overwhelming. But I say just dive in and figure it out. Lots of room to grow in your ability to play Homesteaders.

Good auction/engine building game.
I love the auction mechanics for the building contract.  There's one contract less than the number of player so each round, at least one player can't build.  Passing during the auction makes you advance on the railroad track and gives you a bonus (that gets better the fartest you are).  It also saves you money so you will probably be able to overbid the other players next round.
The building that gives the most vp are only available in the last 2 round.  Bidding become very tough at that point.  Every player wants to build but how much can you afford to pay?  Is it worth taking 1, 2 or more debt (negative vp at the end if not paid)?

The building are the same each game but the order in which the contract comes prevent the games from being scripted.
The 2 player rules for auction makes this game works at every player count!

Nice game that reminds me of "Through the Ages", but the streamlined, short version of it. You have to manage your upkeep, pay your workers and get buildings you want, before someone else does. Different resources and exchange rates keep your mathy half happy.
The rules are short and the game isn't lengthy, too.

The things I didn't like too much, are the points given for buildings, as there's a big jump at the end. I'm also not sure, if you really need that many different resources. It seemed to me, that you could cut one or another without changing the game much, if at all.

Still, this is a good game to puzzle with, that comes with only a handful of rules and should be playable in an hour.

This one combines good elements from many infrastructure building games (interesting choice of buildings leading to a very branchable tech-tree, many commodities with interesting relations, good old Amun-Re bidding) to a fixed 10 round playing time. Excellent work from a new designer!

Only negative thing I've come across is that the complexity of the trading interactions and other elements can be a bit baffling for new players, which can cast some doubt about their end-game points. It's nigh impossible to start tracing backwards where the points came from and if they are correct. But this should only be a problem in the first game or not even there.

Oh, and this one needs Chicago Express treatment as well. It just looks a bit too dull even for old west.

Edit: After some more games the initial joy of slowly getting the point of different buildings has faded a little, but more worryingly all the fiddly buying, selling and trying to come up with correct combinations for buildings starts to feel too much like work. Lowered from 8,5 to 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game is like a lot of other economic engine games, where you need to collect money and resources to build buildings that help you collect more money and resources, etc.  It's a little important to know what buildings are coming up, but there are multiple winning strategies, so it's more important to be flexible.  Producing lots of Trade tokens is highly important in maintaining flexibility, and are basically worth 1 point for 2 tokens at the end (converting $1 back and forth to wood, for example).

In my first play, I was told that going way into debt isn't a bad thing.  Well, that depends on how the other players are doing -- if they're also way in debt, it could work.  Or if there's a critical auction to win, where the result is like a 20-point swing, it's probably worth taking a few debts for it.  On the other hand, it's good to force people to bid higher, then pass, leaving them to deal with the debts.  People may go wild over the points for the final round of buildings, but if they're paying 16, mostly on debt, and you can use that 16 to retire 3 debts, that could be big difference.

I underestimated the value of gold production in my first game, and it was painful.  Gold can be used to pay for bids, and can be converted pretty easily into higher goods like copper or cows, and those resources are needed to build some very valuable city-age buildings.  The Copper Mine is also very good for higher buildings.

Important rule that's easy to miss (on page 3 of the rules): you are not allowed to buy more than one building of the same name!

Overall, I like the game (much more than games like Caylus), and think it could be a classic.  Need more plays to decide.  Helping it is the fact that it's relatively short -- maybe 1.5 to 2 hours.

Hey, this turned out to be much better than expected. A solid Amun Re style auction with several other resources to manage and special action buildings to buy. It's complex (think buildings in Puerto Rico) but not unreasonably so. The ten round limit keeps the intensity up and ends the game well before it can overstay its welcome. Better than average production as well, for example the two toned cow meeples. Looking forward to trying again.

RATING: 7.25
Homesteaders is a mix between an auction game and a worker placement game, with a Western city-building theme.  It is a very nicely balanced game, with lots of choices between resource/$ accumulation and pursuing different auctions/builds to improve one's position.

The game focuses on limited auctions for building licenses- winning an auction does not guarantee that players will have enough resources to actually build the building that they would like to.  There is a simple Loan/Debt option, which of course punishes you for over-reliance, like a Wallace or Feld game might.

It plays very quickly through the 10 rounds of resource collection and auctions, and certainly based on my 1st play different paths came out with similar point totals (22/20/20 in my 3-player solo learning game).

The game also offers the option to switch Bid options when behind, or to Pass at any point and choose Railroad Advancement instead for added income at the loss of the opportunity to build this round.

Different buildings offer different resources, and possibly end-game points; with 4 types of buildings combination strategies are very possible, with lots of options open for players.

I liked it immediately, and I'll start this at a 7.25 for a solid mid-weight euro-game from an American publisher.

Normally I'm not a fan of these kinds of games. They tend to have a lot of busy work that just feels like I'm wasting my time. With Homesteaders you cut out all of the fat, and get to the good stuff. That said, the mechanics weren't 100% polished. Still, if you're looking for an engine building game that won't eat up your whole night this is for you.

The good: Multiple paths to victory, tough decision making in every turn, time wise it fits in nicely

The bad: Too many fiddly little bits which take up a large amount of table space and irritate me

The ugly: The damn pieces! all frayed cardboard

I must say though overall it is a good game with some very tough decision making involved and is well worthy of an 8

Further reflection at a later date, it's ok... 7s fair

Another one of those stripped-down, economic optimization games, along the lines of A Castle for All Seasons. There are only ten turns to accomplish everything. It seems not much is going on, but then the engine kicks in the last few turns for oodles of options.

Even though I won my first game, I wasn't really excited. Was it even worth the time spent in playing it? No, not really. I may have to reconsider it another time. For now, it is a '6'.

Nem rossz játék, nem is lenne hosszú, de az épületek teljesen átláthatatlanok, állandóan nézni kellett mit akarunk építeni, minden körben újra és újra. Nagyon rosszul van megoldva. Örülök, hogy a saját építkezésemet tudom figyelni, fogalmam sincs arról, hogy a másik mit csinál. Persze lehet látni, hiszen előtte van, de annyira káoszos az egész, hogy arra már végkép nincs energiája az embernek, hogy a másikat is figyelje, ezért a vége teljesen meglepetés volt. Azt hittem győzök, erre 10 ponttal voltam lemaradva az elsőtöl. Követhetetlen a játék.

Interesting mechanics, tight game play, easy-to-teach but many decisions involved. There are a number of avenues to victory, and it all boils down to which engine strategies you build and how effective you are at exploiting them. The auction feature of this game is quite good, and I especially like the 3-player dummy rules. It's nice to get a decent consolation prize when you lose an auction, and the different buildings with different benefits adds variation to the gameplay. Big thumbs up! I'm just hoping the expansion comes along soon.

An auction game that plays very quickly.  There's a lot going on and definitely a potential for AP with all the possibilities of trading goods with the bank, and I'm guessing this is why the trade tokens exist.  Although the game is short and compact, it's possible to build up a bit of an engine, and there are a lot of different ways to go with it. I quite like games of this sort. (2 plays)

Dec09: 

Well, for full disclosure, the publisher was the one looking at one of my designs.

Having said that, Homesteaders was a good game. I expected okay. I got better than "okay". Too early to see if it makes great.

I enjoy that it only asks you to make important choices. I also enjoyed that the first game we ever played still only took 75 minutes.

Now, the components are hit or miss. It also was damp as hell and had to be dried for a couple days.

It is also *right* at my limit for component count. Like Machu Pichu, I just dump all the wood resources together since a human eye can quickly differentiate color when they reach for a good. If I had separate piles for all 6 wooden bits, it'd be past my comfort level.

I enjoyed the many different buildings.  You're only going to get 8ish of them per game.  So piecing them together like a puzzle is great fun.

Actual Rating: 8ish for now.

Mar12:

Publisher is no longer in the picture for me, and I've since gotten the second edition.  I really need to play it more, but nothing had really broken down for me.  The resource swapping has gotten a little more manageable for me.  There's still the degenerate VP dance during the last income phase, but you can pretty much crowd source the min-max to speed that up.  Nice job Alex.

Extremely solitaire feel.
There is so much to process while optimizing your economic engine that there is no time to look - at least briefly - what others are doing.  And it rarely matters...

Oh, I so wanted to like this game after reading the reviews - a "quality" auction trading game that worked well for two. I even waited for the "better components" version (second edition).

Not for us. One play was enough. The game is as dull as dishwater. One of those dreadful games where experience of what tiles are coming in next round and the synergy with the earlier rounds is paramount. This makes the game the opposite of fun for me and an unpleasant experience for new players.

Add to that there is nothing "new" in the game, we have some easily pleased people rating it highly!

I may try it again with more players, but it was a poor experience with two , and there are just so many other "better" games out there clambering for my attention.

Talked into playing another 2-player game. A better understanding helped but still got thrashed and still do not "get" the game at all. 

Time to trade away or sell! Rating reduced.

This is one of my favorite games. Really thinky when you have to make worker placement choices, then exciting during the auctions, and then thinky again when you have to select which building you buy. How much debt is too much debt? Is it better to go with the automatic production or a building that requires a worker but provides greater flexibility?

And don't forget to get trade token production EARLY!

Homesteaders is a clean, straightforward combination of an auction game and an engine-building game. It has an interesting ramp-up where players start with barely anything before being able to hoard a treasure trove of resources for purchasing new buildings by the end of the game. Yet, it's not an extremely compelling ramp-up as there aren't really powerful combinations to discover as much as simply going after the buildings that provide the most points based on the way each player chose to grow. It's a solid choice for fans of auction games, but it doesn't displace any of my favorite examples of the genre.

Rating after 1 play with 4 players.  Warning to other 1st time players... do not get into bidding wars the very first round... the person who drops out is going to have a major advantage for several rounds and in our game won likely because of this.

Long setup time due to all the bits and sorting tiles.  Also would recommend some of the files here on BGG... not knowing what building tiles would be coming up made it hard to know what to build earlier to plan your engine so first game I was playing blind (but it was a learning game).

Liked it enough to buy my own copy (at under $25 it's a bargain even though just after ordering I read there is a 2nd edition in the works).

RATING: 9
Homesteaders is an "economic engine" type of game (featuring many different types of resources, Le Havre-style), and with Amun-Re style auctions thrown in.

Components are ... disappointing (and that's being generous). Artwork is drab and uninspired, and my copy had its share of production issues - insufficiently die-cut counters and badly aligned printing on tiles and counters on some of the sprues. At least the 'coweeples' are nice.

With the component trainwreck out of the way, the game plays well. Very well. Starting out, gameplay is confusing as hell, but eventually things start to click. Auctions are agonizing - in a good way! - and the economic development puzzle is fun, although of course at the same time incredibly fiddly!

After half a dozen games, I am ready to declare Homesteaders an amazing game. Easily one of the best new games I have tried in the last year.

Homesteaders occupies a fertile area of the Euro design space.  It's at first glance a game of abundance like Le Havre, with its many different resources and buildings.  But while Le Havre feels like (and I don't mean this as a criticism) multiplayer solitaire at many points, Homesteaders is anything but solitaire thanks to the enforced scarcity of the auction, in which n players compete for n-1 building actions.  Balancing this is the debt mechanism, which also resembles Le Havre but with a harsher conversion rate.  Still, one's money is effectively infinite, so players are really only limited by their own tolerance for debt.

Many resources and multiple paths to victory in a short timeframe.  As players gain more experience it's easy to see this game providing the depth of a 2-3 hour game in a 60-minute span.

Setting rating to an 8 for now but I still think this game has potential to crack my 9s.  I just need to put together a couple good games of it first - I still don't really feel like I get it.

Le Havre lite...I'd probably say Le Havre is my favorite game out there so this one went over real well.  I'm curious to see how I'll feel about it after 10+ plays but my guess is that this game will crack my top ten...perhaps top five.

Edit

After ten plays I'm still really enjoying it.  Not as many options as say Le Havre but there's quite a few.  The auction mechanic and how it plays out is what will keep this game fresh for me.  I'm always willing to play this game.

I bought this one without trying it first, something I try to avoid these days.  I'm thrilled that I did, though, because it's been a big hit with me.  To me it feels like solving a puzzle, and each game has been very enjoyable and challenging.  One of the things I like most is that dropping out of an auction leads to very real and useful rewards; no after-thought consolation prize here, it's seems to be a very integral part of the design.

This past weekend we were at a 4-day gaming event and I taught the game many times, playing it every day.  I know that 7 of the people I taught it to bought it off of the vendor at the event, so it's been a big success for us.  Bring on the expansion buildings!

The others where more lukewarm, one thought it played like Le Havre (that I haven't played), only less smooth (since you cant use other peoples buildings). The other also thought it was too much multiplayer solitaire. Waiting to rate to I get more plays

Euro style game with an auction mechanism similar to [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5404/amun-re]Amon Ra[/url], combined with resource management and collection. The game comes with nine different resources which results in plenty of choices, but also makes the game choices quite opaque. It's useful to familiarize yourself with the level two and three buildings at the start to help you with picking a strategy. I really liked the auction mechanic, but found the resource management a bit euro run-of-the-mill. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Homesteaders has players building a town, acquiring buildings over 10 auction rounds. Once you earn the right to build a building through the auction, you still have the pay the building cost in resources to add it to your tableau. Income is generated by your buildings, either automatically or when a cowboy is placed on them, and usually comes in a mix of resources, cash and trade chips. Throughout the game you can buy and sell just about anything to get the right mix of money and resources you need to build or to buy more cowboys so you can generate additional income through your buildings. You can acquire points throughout the game by selling resources or through some buildings as income. At the end of the game, buildings give points and you get points for your more valuable resources.

What makes Homesteaders different? There is one form of currency I have never seen in another game that gives this one a cool wrinkle: the very ability to buy, sell, and trade is actually a currency in the form of a "trade chip". Even though they have no monetary or resource value, they become the grease to your economic engine and the less of them you earn the more limited your options will be. The game has a very simple and appealing rule set. There is a wide variety of resources that can be bought/sold/traded creating numerous paths to accomplish things. My one concern with replay-ability is that the same buildings become available in the same stages of every game. While the variety of buildings is adequate, it isn't huge and all buildings are in play every game. In spite of that, this game holds that tenuous place of being appealing to both light and heavier gamers for its combination of simple and appealing game play with a fairly challenging economy. The 1st edition had lots of component issues, but my 2nd edition is pretty nice.

Downloaded the prototype from the yahoo discussion group and just started playing it.  Rules and gameplay are relatively simple and easy to learn, but the game is full of interesting and complex decisions.  Thus far, it has received a big thumbs up from the serious gamers in my group who have tried it.

Update Dec. 2009:  Now that the game has been officially released, I am rating it a solid 8 and the runner-up for the best new game of 2009 (second only to Martin Wallace's Automobile, which is a top ten game for me).  Very little luck, excellent design and mechanics drawing from other games I enjoy such as Puerto Rico and Vegas Showdown (both of which are top five games for me).  I prefer Homesteaders as I find it more challenging and enjoyable and less luck-dependent than other recent Euro-style games by mainstream US publishers, such as Dominion and Endeavor, for example.

Only bummer is I wish the game had been picked by a more mainstream US publisher, such as Rio Grande Games (publisher of Dominion) and Z-Man (publisher of Endeavor).  While I wish Tasty Minstrel all the best, some (not all) of the components (particularly the game board) were substandard for a game of this caliber.  On a positive note, I did like the wooden bits, particularly the livestock pieces.

There are some games that work for a lot of different audiences. More casual gamers are drawn in by strong theme and snappy play; more intense gamers zero in on the depth, tension, and strategy beneath the surface. Homesteaders is one of these games. There are games that offer a surprisingly satisfying experience in an unusually short timeframe: Vegas Showdown, Vikings and Tinners' Trail would all be good examples. Homesteaders stands shoulder to shoulder in this company.

The game is a 10-turn land grab in the American west. Money is tight, and bidding for land is fierce. In a four-player game, only three plots of land are sold in a round, so one player will always be shut out, but passing carries its own benefits and timing your off turns is part of the fun. Ranches, general stores, steel mills, railyards, boarding houses, rodeos, depots, meatpacking plants, and more will spring up as the new settlement becomes a town and finally a city. There are lots of options, and only a few turns to cut a path for yourself. Some buildings require you to hire on more labor (to work the meatpacking plant, for example), which means more silver you have generate elsewhere to pay wages. Others are not about manpower (a new Church in the center of town, for example). Some are quite expensive, some are dirt cheap. Some can be built by multiple players, some will only be available to one. The key is finding a set of buildings that works well together, but at what price?

One stand-out feature of Homesteaders is the cross-tension in the land-grab. On the one hand, someone is going to drop out of the bidding. But on the other, they will always do it by choice, not because they ran out of money. Loans are always available, so if a player gives up on a building they really want, it's always because it's no longer worth it to them to spend so much money. I like that a lot. The other main attraction here is that each player has continual access to "the marketplace," meaning that at any point in the turn (in the middle of an auction, for example) they can hit the pause button and trade around their current goods for more money or different goods. So, on the one hand, the game feels very tight, but on the other, there's a single outlet that allows for very open-ended plays. One of the best games of 2009.*

*Note: Homesteaders is available cheaply online ($27), but as a small print run from a new company, the component quality is extremely uneven. [b][size=12]That being said, Tasty Minstrel Games has been very willing to address issues with component quality and to stand by their product.[/b][/size]. I'm more than satisfied with my purchase of this game.  

Edit: I'm upgrading my rating after a 9th play. I think I've hit the "Princes of Florence" home-stretch with this game where the interesting part is the wiggle-room. It's a very polished design. Still not so sure what's supposed to happen when the meatpacking plant comes up on turn 5.... further play reveals that it's fine as long as someone doesn't get it for as steal. Even if the pay a seemingly ludicrous amount for it and feel hamstrung for the rest of the game, they can stay competitive, though.

RATING: 7.5
I missed this when it first came out. I'm glad I had a chance to play. There is an auction for options to buy buildings. There is one less option than the number of players. The person left out can go up a track to get some items as a consolation. Still the buildings are better as they generate resources which lead to VPs.

Homesteaders is well-known mechanisms combined in a new way. There are the various buildings from Puerto Rico, the auctions from Amun Re or Evo, worker placement and resource generation from Agricola. It feels closest to Puerto Rico as the challenge is in exploring the various strategies resulting from the combinations of buildings. Definitely interesting on first game and lots of potential. The fiddliness of resource handling was a bit disturbing.

RATING: 8
Having greatly appreciated Alexfrog's strategy articles on BGG, I had high hopes for this game and it delivers.

It is surely derivative of a lot of other games (Amun Re/Evo type bidding, buildings like Puerto Rico/Caylus/Le Havre) but for people with experience with these games, Homesteaders feels very familiar and easy to learn.  It is very streamlined, and with experience could potentially play very quickly.  

My main initial problem is the potentially time-consuming marketplace trading that must be overseen by a banker to make sure that everyone's doing it right.  There are so many different goods, that the ease with which you can trade makes them all seem fairly interchangeable.  I'm assuming that further experience with the game will help me understand the difference between and relative merit of each good.

The theme is sort of ho-hum.  It could have been worse, being set in Europe, but I still think Wild West themes are not particularly interesting.  The component quality is also fairly low.  The moisture inside the boxes permeated the counter sheets, most of which printed off center, and caused many of them to be punched out irregularly, tearing the paper on the ends.  The wooden pieces are cool though, with unique cow-meeples and little apples to represent food.

A neat auction system relating a bit to Amun-Re, engine building and an inviting theme. In addition it plays relatively quickly and smoothly, but should be avoided with AP prone players.

Meaty, open decision space from clean, small rules.  It's so very satisfying that your buildings bring in income and goods every turn, and such nice anticipation to plot what buildings would work best for you in future.  The set of possible buildings, laid out like a menu, offers a nice variety of paths through the "tech tree", but there is flexibility because you can take loans and usually buy goods if you need them but don't produce them.  The brief but consequential multiple auction works well, including for 2 players.

RATING: 7
Very tough little auction game with a mix of resource management. The game lasts 10 rounds and each round you are bidding on the opportunity to build certain types of buildings. The building give you resources and income which are both crucial, losing a bid in this game can be tough and totally derail your plans. Nice to see that this is coming back into print later this year.

Plays quickly and is easy to learn. New players seem to enjoy this one as well. I wish the board were sturdier, but I love the wooden bits. This game's a winner.

Update: The 2nd edition has much better component quality, including a sturdier board.

Having been used to mainstream Eurogame quality components I found the colours rather bland and the widely reported dampness issue a factor when punching tiles. However after my first 3 player game I can report this is a cracking game which moves along at a good pace and was very enjoyable. Found it far more intuative and fun than Le Harve and itll be on the table regularly. All I need to do now is find out if a Dude Ranch is what I think it is

Two plays so far. The organic tech paths are really neat; you don't have to have a particular building to build something, but they do nudge you in a particular direction - a Steel Mill means you will tend to end up building more rail-related buildings, for example.

The interaction is mostly in the auction (with a bit of buying buildings to deny them to others), so really it's ten chances to interact with the other players per game, plus a lot of resource shuffling. I do enjoy it, but it has to have the right players who: a) play reasonably quickly and b) are aggressive in the auctions. If someone drops out fairly early each auction round, it's a bit of a snorefest.

Pure Euro.  Get resources, allocated resources in ways to get more resources.  At some point during the game switch from gathering resources to gathering points.

I like the debt mechanism.  I like the n-1 auction (though I wish the penalty for losing an auction was harsher, it would make the bidding much more cutthroat).  I like the game length, it fits in at under 90 minutes.  Overall excellent game.

Had a blast on the first play with my daughter.  Was super easy to teach.  TMG has obviously found the best game manufacture in the business, the second edition components are some of the best I've ever see.

Light game, plays fast.

Score could go up for the pure enjoyment of the game and defiantly gets a point for quality of production.

Would only seeing it going down for two reasons at this point.  See how it plays after 5-6+ plays possibility that it could be come same game over and over.  See how the game group likes it.

i expected that i would like this more. however i had the feeling that what i was doing was in order to get one steel and one wood to make something that would produce one gold. instead of having the feeling of making a city. i also had the feeling that acquiring trade chits was pretty hard and i am not sure how you would trade one apple for one worker and you get to keep that worker for the entire game. i like worker placement but because this was worker placement in your own city and i like auctions but it just didnt come together for me and my playing group.

I really enjoy Homesteaders a lot.  The auction mechanic is straight forward and doesn't take away from the main meat of the game.  This really isn't worker placement game since the only place you can put workers is on your own stuff, no one else can get in the way.  Rather i look at as a city building, economic engine game with an auction driving your purchases. 

Official 2p variant works great.

I can't stop thinking about this as being a cross between Vegas Showdown & Le Havre.  It's better than Vegas and quicker than Havre.  A very good game of resource management and debt taking to win often cutthroat auctions to build building which will ultimately produce/be worth points.  Good depth (with a touch of AP) near the end of the game, but an approachable, easy to play flow.  Only played twice but I'm concerned it could get old somewhat fast.  We need an expansion and some game-to-game variability of buildings available for construction or something.

While this has to be one of the WORST China productions ever, the game itself is solid.  It is an Evo style auction as the central mechanism around which the worker placement/trading revolves.  I'd recommend having a good look at the buildings beforehand to try and develop a chain of linked buildings or a long range plan if possible.

A very nice Euro which combines an auction mechanic with an engine building framework to produce a solid balanced game with scope for strategic and tactical variety.  It doesn't feel terribly new but it is done quite well for what it is.  I am not a fan of games that encourage taking debt and bailing oneself out in the endgame (cough Le Havre cough).  I prefer the Age of Steam model where one can take debt but it will hang around your neck for the whole game and likely affect your final score. I realize that it is a part of the game that must be taken into account but I still prefer games that punish taking debt and encourage tight play.

Tasty Minstrel has really broken out big with a number of quality releases. Homesteaders was a rare game that I played once and immediately wanted my own copy of. It’s a resource engine game with auctions, but it goes by at a fast clip; ten turns never seemed so short! Just when you think you have what you need for a good engine, you realize there are only three turns left in the game. A lot of strategy is packed into this game, and I’ve enjoyed trying different approaches each time.

A very interesting game. I really didn't know what to do initially but somehow or rather, it all came together in the end and I won my first game thanks to my production of coins which helped offset my initial debt. It was also tough that there are only 10 rounds and each round only allows you to build a building or not if you didn't auction high enough, which means that you would most likely end up with 8 buildings or less, even down to 5 the whole game. It's basically an economic game where the most efficient moves would win you the game with an element of bidding but I think there is a lot of replayabiliy for this one especially with the huge options of buildings available to be built but only very few opportunities to actually build them. 

Edit: I really want to give this an 8, but at the same time, I didn't want to because I find that after many plays the game becomes a game whereby the player who is most efficient economically will win all the time. However, there are many paths to victory, and it scales wonderfully from 2 to 4 players; it also has tons of replayability. The components are nice too and it's a good game to hook new players with and also short in play time (about 60-90 mins). With that said, this game has received the slight edge to move from a 7 to an 8 in my books.

The more I think about this game, the more impressed I am by it, and playing it spurred plenty of thought.

Homesteaders is probably the first legitimate heir to the legacy of classic euro "systems" games like Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence since (choose your favourite) Goa, Caylus or In the Shadow of the Emperor. On the other hand, it is also a streamlining of a lot of the design seen in games like Agricola and Le Havre and, thanks to the streamlining, works far better for me than those games do (although I do not hate them, either).

Complaints that Homesteaders doesn't do anything new, though, look at the mechanics and not the experience. Setting aside the fact that it is the first strategic resource shuffling game to play reliably (regardless of player count) in under 2 hours, the Trade token constraint on that resource shuffling is, I think, original, interesting and more effective than similar systems in worker placement games. It's probably no coincidence that this is the first important resource shuffler (that I know of) that isn't a worker placement game, too.

This is one of the all-too-rare genuinely planning-focused euros, and I love almost all of them. The buildings do a great job of differentiating player positions and setting up strategic paths.

I think the idea of auctioning off building lots instead of specific buildings is what makes this game work, though. It maintains competition while leaving players with the latitude to follow a plan instead of tactically adapting to the buildings on the market. Not a solution I would have thought of, either.

The simple graphic design works for me, since it is readable (once you know the iconography) from across the table, but other production issues bother me more. I got one of the damp sets, and that made punching the myriad bits frustrating, with several small pieces (mostly the star-shaped VP chits) delaminating some. The misaligned print is bad enough that the games should probably have been returned to the printer, although it's not quite a show stopper for me.

A game that takes the building mechanics of Puerto Rico, the auction from Amun Re, a reasonably complex economy and slaps a Old West theme.  I love PR, and the complex economy is very interesting so I find this an excellent game.  This games suffers from its first printing which had abysmal component quality.  The second edition has wonderful components.  I really love the game and consider it one of my favorite games.

A great offering from a first-time publisher. For the printing I have the quality of the components is a bit suspect. Printing is a bit offset when comparing back to front on tiles and counters and there is considerable warping in the cardboard. 

This is a great game though and the play will shine straight through the production issues. Auctions are tense especially when you decide to go the extra effort and take just one more debt token. Trade tokens and building a good progression of buildings are important or you'll find yourself lacking in resources.

Multiple paths to a win are possible. I've seen a player very nearly win with only one worker the entire game.

[i]Homesteaders[/i] is a thoughtful game though not quite the brain-burner of a [i]Le Havre[/i] or [i]Caylus[/i]. Nor is it as fun as a two-player game as, say, [i]At the Gates of Loyang[/i] or [i]London[/i].  Our one play with three players did turn out to be much more interesting, but I have so many other three/four player games that I'd much rather play.

+ easy, straithforward  rules  - original way of bidding
+ many paths to victory
+ due to the short play time, this game will be played a long time before it's getting stale.

What I don't like about this game is that it seems to be made for people with extremely good eyes. 
Small cards contain small texts and small icons which make it very difficult to oversee your options. 

This game goes fast, and making good decisions quickly on what cards to bid for, is essential. 

Otherwise this games seems to be a nice try to make a quick game with a lot of depth. Many things to consider !

A very attractive (2nd edition) and nicely produced game, with a tight set of rules that have clearly been playtested. Sounds fantastic, right? Well, it's also very dry. Some parts feel like they're straight out of Puerto Rico, though the auction element is notably new (replacing the role selection in PR).

More than anything, though, I didn't feel a great amount of western theme, and that's what held it back for me. I've owned and sold off Way Out West, but that's got more western feel. So does Carson City, which might be the best western-themed euro of all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I initially rated this a 6 after one play, but then couldn't get it out of my head. There's too much going on to judge this game fairly after one play, but I definitely want to play it again.

The rules aren't complex, but despite turning in a respectable third place score, playing Homesteaders for the first time was 90 minutes of brain-burn for me. That was mainly due to a) the variety of the buildings and their abilities and b) my general lack of skill at engine-building games.

I love the auction mechanic. It's incredibly unforgiving, and makes for some tense turns and some real highs and lows throughout the game.

The first edition, which I played, is notable for having incredibly cute meeples but godawful component quality -- miscut coins, a thin, curly board, and tiles that show wear too easily. Definitely worth waiting for the 2011 second edition.

Great game with cool bits (2nd edition). I played this the first time as a 2 player with my wife. The "dummy" player, which is non-intrusive, works quite well in the auction setting. A few issues though:

First, there is a steep learning curve in this game. This is due in part to the multiplicity of buildings. While the buildings provide multiple paths to victory (always a good thing), they also make it necessary to understand their benefits in order to develop various strategies. To be sure, this is part of most games. The difference here is that there are just SO many, which makes the learning curve exponentially higher.

Second, this game (at least during the learning period) causes serious analysis paralysis. I don't typically struggle with AP, so experiencing it in this game threw me off quite a bit.

When you combine these two shortcomings, you have a game that is certainly difficult to introduce to non-gamers. It is an great game, which incorporates its theme into gameplay very well. I definitely recommend it, notwithstanding the aforementioned caveats.

The production quality is a real issue, I think. With so many games to choose from, why would I want to buy a game with components like these? Too bad, because, as I said, I really like the look of the game.

It´s auctions, and it can´t accomodate five players, but nevertheless, I can see myself bying a 2nd printing, or better yet, a 2nd edition of this.

Seems to be a well-designed game, but it isn't for me. I don't enjoy games with tons of available buildings with small text that don't vary from game to game. Homesteaders reminds me of two other popular games in that respect, Puerto Rico and Ora et Labora. I don't like those games either. If you think that makes me insane, you should probably play Homesteaders.

I do like the Vegas Showdown style bidding because you can read the other players and bid them up/bluff, making them waste money. Also, it probably plays better with four players (I played with three).

I'll play Homesteaders again, but I hope its not for a long while. There's nothing wrong with the game per se. It all works, its logical, yet that doesn't equal fun.The huge array of buildings, too many resource types, and prior knowledge of the synergy of certain buildings being a requirement, makes it a quagmire for a newbie. It seems too much puzzle and not enough game.

An economic engine game that has bits of Amun-Re (auction, but without the overbid mechanism), but is very heavily influenced by Puerto Rico. This is a good thing.

I've enjoyed playing this one very much and look forward to doing so again. The only thing that lets it down is the production quality, which isn't great. In fairness, the publishers are new to the business and I think they've had a bum deal from their suppliers. I'm sure the next batch of games will show improvement. Should this get a second edition release, I'll be in the queue.

I had my reservations before my first play because the very simple rules, already familiar mechanics, fixed turn number, and somewhat preprogrammed flow. Fortunately the abundance of variables puts it way beyond my calculating capabilities, and after quite a few plays I still feel like I'm only scratching the surface. The player interaction is limited to the bidding phase, but it's fast and satisfying. The components (in 2nd edition) are stellar, I love the artwork and the general appearance. It's a mix of puzzle and cruel bidding with really straightforward rules; kids above 8 can play and enjoy this, without much effort.

this is a really good game, I didn't realize going in to our first play that it was a real brain burner. My rating at this time could go up or down a point. I feel that more plays are needed to get a real grasp for the strategy. It was a little chaotic, exchanging at the market. But still very enjoyable and it felt like a very deep game, again unexpected. Very intriguing!

It gets a bit tedious to keep track of all your bonuses and income later in the game, and it's not easy to get a good grasp of the building tiles with just a quick glance - I guess you just have to know them. Otherwise a solid game, and it comes with some of the cutest meeples I've ever seen.

Economic engine game, lasting 10 rounds, that ramps up quickly.  First you place workers (these produce various commodities which can be bought and sold for other goods or money).  Next you pay for your workers ($1 each).  Finally there's an Amun Re style auction for [# of players]-1 the right to build.  The auction is the heart of the game because you're bidding for the right to build -- usually certain types of building but there are often bonuses too such as a free worker.  The cards you build produce goods and VPs (many require workers).

If you don't win a bid you can move up a track which provides one free item -- more items become available as you move up the track.  I think knowing when to duck an auction is a key part of the game (something I need to figure out).

I really loved how you can buy or sell at the market at anytime to produce the goods/money you need.  The debt mechanic also works well. 

Homesteaders has quite a few plays in it until dominant strategies start arising.  I though I had my first game sewed up but it turned out somebody who was not producing as much as I had better end game VP-point making cards.  There seems to be an interesting balance to look out for, between what you produce and end game VP point potential.

I wouldn't be surprised to see an expansion out for this soon!

*Oct 2012* I really, really like this game. It's got the tight engine building feeling of an Uwe Rosenberg game, only with a less annoying theme! I also am not a huge fan of optimizing real estate like in Agricola, mainly because I suck at it. This game doesn't have that and therefore I am better at that kind of thing :D

Having said all that the game is great with 2, better with 3, and haven't played with 4. The best way to describe this game is what one of my opponents said during a game "Dammit, is the church gone already? I was going to build that this time!" The game doesn't let you do what you want, and fighting the other players and the game to build a kickass homestead makes this game rock. And it plays fast!

That was a terrible explanation of why I like this game. Just watch Reviews Without Pants take on it.

*edit Dec 2012* Having played Agricola quite a bit more and it now being one of my favorites, I've gotten much better at optimizing real estate. Having said that, I still think this game rocks and am always happy to break it out! If only my wife was more receptive to learning a new game once in a while >:|

*Oct 2013* My first play since January. 4p game at work (3 newbs). Everyone loved it. Revisiting this game as a more experienced gamer, I was able to grok it much better than I had in the past, despite not knowing the buildings in advance. I still didn't win, even with 56 points (winner had over 60. Third place was far behind with 30)! I'm wondering how I would have fared had I not taken the bank in round 5, plus had my opponents been more competitive. Hard game to break out as it's so rare we have just 4, but the 3 other players would love to play it again. 

Excellent auction game. So tight and balanced, so satisfying. Money Well Spent

Bought ding 'n dent from CoolStuffInc for $20. Looks like someone literally put their fist through the bottom of the box. I probably got taken in the deal - it was:

"Hey coworker, how much is Homesteaders? There's no price on the box."

"Ummm...$20?"

Still, I wanted it, and I felt a little sorry for it. I'm going to give it a good home. Unless it sucks, then that bitch is gone.

Update: first play was overwhelming and not altogether positive. I feel like I understand the rules but don't Get It. There's a whole heck of a lot of conversion here. Just don't know about this game yet.

Not inspiring enough for a second play. Auctioned for $15.

I finally tried this with 3 and can now say it's not appreciably different than the 2-player (with a dummy) game. That's good news for those who like the game and want to try it with the 2-player variant. For me, it merely confirms that this game remains the same uninteresting solitaire it was when I gave up on it after only playing it with 2. This is yet another resource management/conversion game, and folks who love that type of game might find something worthwhile here, especially in the quick playing time and high quality components (2nd edition). But if you don't like the idea of converting these pieces into those pieces, which you can then turn into those other pieces for money or a victory point, then you're not going to be into this game, because that's pretty much all it is. This might truly be best with 4 players, but it will also be 90 minutes, which is longer than I can stand for a game like this. [boardgame=31260][/boardgame] remains the only game of this sort that grabs me at all, and it too plays with two in just an hour.

Western themed Euro-style worker placement, production game.

The heart of the game is the auction. There are 3 auctions going on simultaneously and you go round and round until all pass.

From the cards you win, you can build them if you have the resources. Then the buildings generate resources and the game continues.

The Second edition version cured production ills of 1st edition that was such an immediate turnoff.  We ended up playing this more than any other city building/ development  themed  and (to be honest, better) game in our collection,  including Le Havre, Ora et Labora and Suburbia.  Still a keeper although near the bottom of my top 10 still in it. For some in our group it was the American West setting of the game that keeps it there,but I just find it an easier but fun, interesting, rewarding  city building style game .  Always feel may games were time well spent with this one.

RATING: 6.5
Homesteaders is a very straightforward efficiency engine game. It's fraught with "multiple paths to victory", very little luck, lots of lean resource management, and all of the other stuff you'd expect from the genre. It also features an Amun Re / Evo / Vegas Showdown auction mechanism to distribute the buildings [above] that make up your efficiency engine. This could have been a non-starter, except for the very clever way the designer hacked player interaction / competition into a genre built around "doing what everyone else isn't doing". The things that you're bidding on every round aren't the buildings themselves [which might in a similar game have just been turned up randomly in biddable lots at the start of each turn], but the rights to build a particular type of building [of which there are really only 3].

Each round, players bid on cards like these. The winner pays their bid, then selects a building of the matching type, pays its cost, and puts it into play in their tableau. This makes the bidding phase worthwhile. Not everyone might need the Bank [above] for their chosen "path to victory"--someone else might want the Depot and yet another the Stables--but everyone is going to need "Commercial" buildings eventually to succeed. The auction is the only real source of player interaction and serves to put common scarcity into a system where resource and development needs between players are almost completely non-intersecting. It's a very clever mechanism, and one that similar auction-driven games like Vegas Showdown, The Scepter of Zavandor, and even Power Grid could benefit from.

Scepter of Zavandor, for instance, is a similarly straight-forward efficiency game [based on the progenitor, perhaps, of the genre: Outpost] with a bunch of different "paths to victory". There are "artifact" cards that do much what Homesteaders' buildings do, except they're made available directly through an auction. The end-game bonuses and in-game monetary system highly reward extreme specialization, so when these cards come up for auction they usually only benefit at most two, maybe three, of the five or six players in the game. A player who needs one puts it up for bid, gets passes from half the table, and maybe settles into a tit-for-tat bidding war for a turn or two with the one other player who's interested, and we all move on. The only reason it works at all is because of the high player count. [This is why Outpost can support, and is often preferred with, up to 9 players.]

Ideally, this keeps even the 2-4 players in Homesteaders highly invested in every auction and makes bidding wars a frequent occurrence. A couple of things keep this from really happening, unfortunately. First, the resource management part of the game is probably a few notches too tight. Because you need both money and resources at the time you win a card at auction, you have to be doubly prepared to seize any opportunities that arise [loans can assist with financial trouble, at least]. This often makes it simply impossible for a player to enter an auction, even if they have the cash. Second, the game offers an "out" for players who run into this pitfall, in the form of the much-lauded Railroad Development Track. This is akin to a favor track in Caylus, except you move up by not doing anything in a bidding round [i.e. dropping out of all auctions]. It is clearly intended to keep players "in the game", but it cannibalizes the very interesting auction by being too strong an option.

Admittedly, experienced players of the game consider taking loans and bidding very high to be a winning strategy [c.f. Le Havre loans, Stone Age starvation, etc], and passing to be sub-optimal in most situations. This is probably lost on new players, which keeps early plays from being interesting. You can bet when you design a game with "penalties" or "loans" that most players are instinctively not going to want to take any, whereas word on the street around BGG is that 5-8 loans is normal for a game of Homesteaders. Players who know all the buildings can probably also prepare better for auctions. Even so, the very interesting auction / building allocation mechanism here isn't really enough to get around the fact that this is as straightforward a cube-churner as they come. There's nothing extraordinarily compelling or interesting in the combo-building part of the game; the auction is the entire game, for better or [and?] for worse.

Fantatistic. It's an engine-building game that doesn't take long. The rules are suprisingly simple, so are the building and the relationship between them. I also like the large amount of freedom you have, as you can buy and sell stuff and borrow money as much as you like. 

The game is often compared with Le Havre. Both are engine-building games. Le Havre is longer, suitable for less number of people, and the system is more sophisticated, however deeper, more satisfying, and enable you to make long-term plan. 

Homesteaders, on the other hand, is easier to understand (and thus, easier to solve which can be good or bad. depends on how you look at it) On the surface auction seems to make Homesteaders more interactive. However, as building can be entered by anyone in Le Havre, blocking, using building, and builds stuff in anticipation of future creates a much more interactive game.

A very good distilled euro; it hits a lot of traditional euro mechanics (action point selection, resource management with different types, Caylus-style favour track) in a surprisingly short period of time. Clearly the designer knows his games.

Homesteaders is a very good engine/progression game. You have buildings that generate resources, then you spend those to get more buildings eventually getting more VPs than other players. I like how smoothly it plays, how the inclusion of the auction forces players to determine the value of what they need, and how simple to understand the game is while still having a good amount of strategy.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---
Medium-to-light economic engine building game with an initial auction that will define what type of building you can get.

Component quality is good (except in the 1st edition). The cardstock is thick, the resource meeples are great. The are is a bit broing and dry,though.

The game is easy to teach, but it has some more depth than it seems.

No new mechanics, you just action building license, choose one specific building of the type you got the license for, distribute workers between your buildings and use your buildings abilities.

The game lenght can be even less than advertised, but the game is prone to AP because of the options you have.

Replayability: buildings will be the same in every game. The variations in your builds will depend on player interaction.

Note: do not buy 1st edition!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ten rounds of some serious gaming but easily playable under an hour. Too many things you want to the same time on top of enjoyably tight economy. Seems to offer several ways to gather points which is always a plus. Only complain here would be that in the beginning there aren't that many things you can do and I'm a bit worried that there will develop only a few openings you start to use every time that lead to a certain strategy. Hope I'm wrong.

Yet another game of auction based production engine building, suffering from the usual issues of the genre. Not annoying like Vegas Showdown or Phoenicia, though; I'd say this is more on the Peloponnes end of the spectrum.

The component quality is adequate for people who are interested in this kind of games in the first place. One usability issue kept bothering me, though: The names of the building types are color-coded on the auction tiles, but not on the actual building tiles. Because of this, I had to keep constantly checking which colors I needed for my game end scoring powers. EDIT: This has been fixed in the TMG 2nd edition.

Traditional resource optimization engine + bidding game with a very open economy. Two recommendations when playing:
1) Get familiar with the different buildings before you start playing, so you can have an idea of what kind of resources are most valuable and what to expect from buildings as game progresses.
2) Get a source of "trade" tokens, otherwise you won´t be able to sell or buy anything.

Ottimo gioco di gestione risorse e pianificazione. Meccaniche semplici ma profondità garantita grazie ad una varietà notevole di edifici, l'ambientazione cerca di ricordare lo sviluppo delle prime cittadine del far-west, non si sente molto ma comunque è carina. L'obiettivo è quello di edificare una serie di esercizi e palazzi che possano garantire rendite e risorse le quali verranno poi spesso trasformate in punti vittoria. Un gioco per nulla banale dove la fortuna trova molto poco spazio, anche la componentistica è decisamente buona e ricercata. Un ruolo importante del gioco e della strategia è affidato ai debiti che si possono fare senza limiti ma pagandone interessi da usurai. Le tessere degli edifici ricordano un po' per colore e grafica il vecchio Monopoli. Rischio di paralisi d'analisi nel finale se giocato con giocatori lenti. con un po' di esperienza e giocatori veloci invece la partita potrà durare meno di 1 ora.

[2010/01/27]

I just reviewed another auction game, (princes of florence) and i guess it's good to mention that here... are the games similar... not really... but they have the same kind of fun factor...

I played this game twice: 
The Second game I learned the hard way that debt is not your friend, and that buying everything isn't neccesarily the best way to go... 
The first game I won by making smart purchases that i could afford... Anytime a game rewards you for being a smart shopper i'm in favor of it.

So is this a great game... hmmm... i like princes of florence better thats for sure...  this is more of a "really good game"

so without being too harsh i give some pro cons:
Pros:
-Auctions help keep game even/balanced
-Auction break points (i.e. cost jumps from $9->$12) keep auctions fun
-the abilites a tile gives you is roughly close to the building cost of that tile (there's a difference between building cost and purchase cost)
-passing on an auction is not that bad

Cons:
-scoring is very very tedious
-easy potential for human error with purchases
-value of cards is not that obvious (may favor veteran players)



Overall HIGHLY recomended, that is if you don't mind a lot of administrative work.... I think i would enjoy this game MUCH more with a scoring track... or some better way to keep score. 

Here is a sample flow of the end game... everyone makes their last turns.... everyone sits there for 10 minutes trading in chips/markers/resources all by themselves to maximize their score, then everyone trys to properly add that score to any bounus they might have (usually in their head)... and then they announce their score to the world... there can be a 5 minute delay between players announcing thier scores... and the tension usually fizziles into a "really? you scored that much?... i would check but i don't want to spend the 10 minutes to calculate it, guess you win"

[b]Homesteaders[/b] was sold via auction 9/22/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]This game has been on my radar since I got into the hobby, but it wasn't readily available so I never got a chance to play. I finally found a new copy of the second edition for an unbelievable price so I decided to pick it up. Our first game was a disaster because I got a few rules wrong which really affected how the game played out. We still saw things we liked and very quickly brought it to the table again and nailed down the rules. 

Homesteaders shows it's age in some ways, which is not a dig at the game, more of an observation on how game design is changing. At it's core Homesteaders is a very simple and somewhat linear game as you start by getting buildings that give you "x" resources and slowly progress to give you more profitable resources as well as avenues to score points. What I've found enjoyable is how you can customize your play by using workers to generate various resources/points and the snowball that is created because you really need to plan ahead and have a plan since the game only lasts for 10 rounds. 

If I was going to compare it to a current game I've found it very similar to [thing=169794][/thing] in terms of how the game state escalates and the limited number of buildings/technology tiles you can choose from which does limit the amount of strategies you can employ. I think Homesteaders is better with two and I like the auction system in Homesteaders better than choosing action discs in Haspelknecht. 

Overall I am very happy with Homesteaders for now, I'm curious how it will hold up to multiple plays. However; there is definitely a lot left to explore for such a concise design. The huge pluses for me are the fact it plays great with two, including the way auctions are handled and it offers a pretty thinky experience in a 30-45 minute game.[/i]

The beauty of this game is the Sid Sackson style market which works similar to Bazaar.  There is just a little too much for me here.  Much like Porto Rico, which is a bit too much for me as well.  But I love the theme of Homesteaders and the mechanics and detail fit well.  The pieces are nice but the cards and board could have been better.

A bit too Caylus-y for me. It's like Caylus meets Phoenicia (lots of different pathways and combos), only with Evo-style auctions, minus the worker placement (the workers are like PR colonists - placed to switch your buildings on).

It's 10 Amun-Re type auctions for the right to buy tech tree advances (buildings) that provide more income, more resources, more VPs; aiming to buy techs which complement each other. The auctions were slower than I was expecting. In Evo and Amun-Re you're bidding for a known commodity. Here you're bidding for the right to buy any tech within the auctioned category. The question is re-asked each time it’s your turn to bid - which tech(s) in the category are you wanting, and if you're outbid, is there something in another auction category you could go for that complements (or re-news) your strategy, or should you simply bale out and get a consolation resource. All of which takes time which will hopefully diminish with replay. The (do anytime) marketplace, where you can trade money for resource and vice versa, provides for cleverness and increased options (a good thing), the cost being that it further slows the auctions while people dress rehearse resource conversion options to determine what they can and should/shouldn't build. Another nice thing is the ability to take a loan at any point, so you're never shut out of auctions. The game will start to shine when everyone understands the tech tree / vp acquisition options and can quickly value their options. Getting over that analysis downtime hump is the issue to begin with.

Holy Resource Management, Batman!! Great tight auction town-building game. As heavy as Agricola. Great components and graphics. Great feel. Might be too dry for some. But it is the auctions which really shine and can cause a barroom brawl. Good with 2 players, too. Fantastic game.

To build your town effectively, you can't be too thrifty, nor be too nice. Also, you MUST find ways to balance debt, money, resources, trading chits, and, ultimately, victory points. You must [i]think[/i] in this game to survive.

BTW, I'm terrible at this game.

RATING: 7
"Clever auction/resource-conversion engine-building game. After 4 plays, I'm still not good at it."

What I like:
- No attacks other than auctions and buying a building first
- I'm a big fan of the multi-auction format
- Great components (aside from 1st Ed quality issues)
- Unusual theme
- Plays in 60-90 minutes

What I don't like:
- It is hard to do well until you know all the buildings
- Every round, one player must drop out of the auction
- You pretty much have to take on debt

This is a really clever design which I highly respect. I don't love the game though, and I'm not sure why.

I would give it a rules/complexity weight of 2.5, but I think when you factor in the depth, the BGG-voted weight of 3.1 is reasonable. Our 4p game with 2 first-timers took 90 minutes after 10 minutes of rules/setup.

NOTE: Although the rules don't point it out, at the end of the game if you have at least 1 coin, you can convert Trade tokens to VP at a 2:1 ratio (1/2 VP per Trade token) by repeatedly buying and selling wood.

Based on one play: Very simple to explain, but then the options are numerous. You bid to build  different locations which allow you to produce goods and trade tokens with your cowboys. This then opens up a lot of possible trades as you try and convert goods and money into points during the game and for bonus points on the buildings. Lots of options, yet very few actual rules.

RATING: 7
Borrows the bidding mechanism from Amun Re and builds a city building/resource management game around it.  The market system works well and there are some quite powerful combinations of buildings available to compete over.  The bidding, as one player minimum will be left out each round and have to accept the railway consolation prize, can be very competitive.

All this said, I think Amun Re is a better game by a pretty good margin.  Much of a game of Homesteaders is spent behind player screens mapping out market conversions.  I prefer the higher focus on opponents in Amun Re.

RATING: 7
In this game, you use guys and buildings to produce a variety of different resources, which then in turn can be spent to build more buildings or get more guys, or sold for a profit.  There's an Amun-Re-style auction for the right to build buildings, and I've always enjoyed that style of auction.  Overall, the game concepts are solid, but I've found that the game can bog down as it progresses due to the large number of different resources, the presence of "trade chips" that give you the right to buy and sell resources, and the one building that increases sale prices, making math particularly difficult.  The wooden components are great, but quality of everything else is sub-par.

In a word, awesome. Perfect length (75-90 mins), short but tense turns (due to the auctions), multiple strategy paths. It is auction/resource management distilled to its essence. I have even enjoyed playing it solo (using the desiginer puzzles posted on BGG) more than any other solo game. 

After playing it dozens of times solo, I am a little concerned about limited viable strategy paths but in actual fact I think that is only a problem with the solo game. The auctions should change which paths are better from game to game.

This is a auction/worker placement game. The pieces are really nice and the game runs very smoothly. It feels like every aspect is well thought out. You bid on the rights to construct buildings of a specific type, then if you win, you get to add one of those available buildings to your board, paying all construction costs. Most of those buildings have worker action spots than you can then use to generate points and resources.

It's simply a pleasure to play, but for the best experience it does need 4 players exactly. The experience of this game is really strong, and I absolutely love the theme, and I love working the tiles after the auction phase. The only big downside for me is that the game doesn't change much session to session. The only variability comes from which tiles you win the bid for.

2nd ed. with no 'mold' problem at all.

1st look appears to be an easy game mechanically but with the potential an AP-inducing if/then selection of choices that include 'screwage' in regards to other players' plans. Knowledge of the possible building combinations to create an efficient 'engine' makes experience a definite advantage.

Trade tokens are so important it seems that the initial turns might become too scripted.

I wish Heather liked this and that there were more buildings. It is a very well crafted game with lots of interesting things happening regardless. I learned this at the same time as Suburbia so to me it feels a bit like a heavier Suburbia with an auction and without the tile placement. The comparison is a stretch but the feelings they produce are similarish.

Homesteaders is a delightfully fun auction game with tons of choices.  The trade chit mechanic, and indeed the whole buying and selling of goods, is truly inspired and one of the most delightful parts of the game.  I really enjoy finding out how much I can get from my simple resources.

The auction mechanic is much more successful than in other games with a similar mechanic (Amun-Re and Vegas  Showdown are the first two that come to mind) because you are buying an opportunity.  In most games with an auction, you are buying something concrete: a particular room for your casino, a particular land plot with particular worth, a particular card or jester or effect.  In Homesteaders, you are buying the [i]opportunity[/i] to buy a whole variety of buildings. No matter where you end up, there is almost always something worthwhile to purchase with your auctioned opportunity.  Additionally, even if someone shuts you out of a particular building, there are plenty of options for pursuing your same strategy.  Resources are scarce, but not so scarce that you feel the oppression of constantly digging yourself out of a hole.  

In short, there are plenty of options in Homesteaders, and the auction forces players to play a different game every time while still offering the flexibility to play the game the way that you'd like.

A solid auction game. Very easy to learn, but looks like it will take a few plays to find a good strategy. Turns play fast since players can all do actions at the same time.

Very nice Euro-style economic builder. Lots of choices and things to think about. Fairly thematic. Low on player interaction: there's an auction every round, but other than that it's multi-player solitaire. (This doesn't bother me, but I know it bothers some others.) Seems well-balanced. Not quite luck-free, but much more rides on your decisions than on the way the auction decks are shuffled.

Initial impressions.  The board is physically smaller than I thought it would be.  The 1st edition isn't as bad as I thought it would be.

RATING: 7
Game with good auction mechanism. I wonder why that auction hasn't been used more. First game is hard for players, since they have to learn all the buildings & trading mechanisms. Then variety ends pretty quickly, since the setup is always almost same (2&3 pile auction offers vary) & trading mechanisms mean everything is everything (if you got trade tokens, you can't be denied access to crucial goods). I feel this game could have been easily better with random setup, but when I try to invent something it leads to long setup (is already long, if you haven't organized tiles carefully after the past session) & the problem that everyone has to evaluate everything (like in first game).

Revised rating down. Nifty game, but it has about the worst analysis paralysis/open knowledge problem I've ever come across. The last couple turns are excruciating.

Feel a bit like a mid-weight Le Havre, with some Carson City in the mix. Fairly straightforward and satisfying engine game, with a brutal auction that gives it real momentum. Unfortunately, it's an almost completely calculable game, and the last couple turns really bog down with everyone doing the math for every bid and purchase.

June '10: Played at Tom's and bought it a week later.  Really enjoying it.  Simple to grasp.  Fairly quick playing time.  Cool auction style.  And terrific with the designer's separate 2-player rules.  Loving it.

Feb. '11: Haven't been playing this at all.  Sad, but just too many other new games (7 Wonders, Civ., Prosperity, etc.).  Hope to play this again soon.....

March '11: Played 2-player game with Tom at PrezCon.  Still a terrific game. Want to play it more often.

Oct. '12: Why don't I play this more.  Definitely a Top 10 game for me, but I only play it a couple times a year.  I guess there are just too many other games.  I've played something crazy like 135 different games this year, but how many have I enjoyed as much as Homesteaders?  Need to play more!!

This game was surprisingly good. Close to perfect game for me and would be my pick for example of the type of game I like best. 

Only reason I don't give 10 is I presume no game is perfect or could not be made better, such as this one could be made even better with a couple more types of buildings to choose each phase (settlement, town, city). 

I find this 90% scratches my itch for Le Havre (which this game has parts of) and even for Through the Ages (not sure why, as no where similar). Both take 2 hours plus with 2 people versus being able to play this in 2 (with learning rules) with 4 and I imagine with more play, under 1.5 hrs.

Played some rounds with the new multilingual third edition at the "Spiel12" fair in Essen.
Use auction to get the right to build. The building creates resources that you can use to build other factories or trade. In the third of 3 phases you can bid for victory point buildings. Nothing new, but it works fine. The components of this multilingual third edition
are great (e.g. the black-white wood cow).

Pros: fast playing game.usually within an hour. Fun worker placement actions. Enriching old west theme. Unique bidding mechanism.

After a long wait following the horrendous quality debacle surrounding the 1st edition, Tasty Minstrel games decided to reprint this interesting, content-heavy brain burner. 

Each player works on adding to his own homestead through bidding for building tiles. There's always one less tile, so bidding gets tense. When won, the player gets the opportunity to build a building of the corresponding type. Each new building produces or provides a different benefit, and each new building gradualy starts the process of a vp engine.

There are various paths to victory, although they may not be plainly apparent.  I've played very few games with no learning curve, and games without one are usually firmly planted in the filler category or they are just plain strategically shallow. Even seemingly simple games such as El Grande can hand you your ass on turn 3. That being said, there's certainly a learning curve for this game, but 1 or 2 games seem sufficient to get over this hurdle.  

Debt is reasonably forgiving in this game, so it's not easy to get burried underneath it. Homesteaders reminds me slightly of Le Harve, but without the "digging yourself out of a hole" feeling. The Amun-Re style auction is a nice touch, and keeps it from turning into multi-player solitaire. The game rewards careful forethought, and much of your time will be spent trying to figure out how to efficiently purchase beneficial tiles at the earliest round possible.

This looks like it's right up my alley. Looking for second edition.

Found it for decent price through Amazon. More to come after I explore it.

Initial impression:  The dummy system works well for 2, however I found the auction a little lacking... let's see. More to come after some more sessions.

Update: Played it a second time and it wasn't all that jazz tbh. It's a very good engine builder no doubt, but the auction is tenseless with just two. I also find the theme a bit too dry and serious. I want to try it with three at some point to see if the auction ramps up with more.

Nice auction game. An interesting economy game - worth a few more plays. There is a surprising amount of long-term strategy involved in your purchases - very often there are multiple choices and you need to see how you plan on developing. 

There are multiple paths to victory, some interesting depths. There's also just enough randomness to mean that the same strategies won't always work (or play out) wihtout some genuine thinking on your feet.

The speed of the game (max 10 'actions' and in all certainty each player will get fewer than this) is quite relentless, and means not only will the game get finished quickly, but also that you're punished quite heavily for misplaying a single build or bid. The fact it's a reletively quick game is essential with this setup.

My favorite game among both auction games and those of changing resources into other resources. [b]Very[/b] tight on the finances, Wallace would be proud. I really enjoy building production engines and this is as good as it gets. Would be perfect if there was more interaction - as is, everybody acts on their own field with the auction the only interaction, and you bid for parcels on which you can erect buildings rather than buildings themselves, so losing doesn't mean necessarily that you won't be able to build what you want, especially that many buildings have several copies.

I'm a sucker for games with buildings/tiles that players purchase and use to give them varied goods, actions and/or income. Add to that a smattering of auctions and I'm on the right path to a game I'll enjoy. Homesteaders is simple to learn and gives players a number of reasonably difficult choices each turn. There's not much in the way of theme, but the bits are nice and the paths seem balanced. It's hard to know how your opponents are doing - everyone seems to be following different resource trees where one item or another is in short supply. Borrowing money is expensive in repayment costs or VP losses, and makes taking loans an interesting decision. Loans allows players flexibility at a significant price. All in all the game is enjoyable and time seems to fly by as your brain remains reasonably active throughout. Play speed should improve with greater familiarity of buildings and options - as with all resource/tech tree games, the first time out you don't have a clue. It's an engrossing 75 minute four player outing.

The second edition printing of this game is as good a quality as any game I've seen. Ten counter sheets to be punched out and really lovely quality wooden pieces. The artwork is particularly appealing. If I ever get a game published I'd want Tasty Minstrel to do it the way they've done this. Superb!

Typical auction game of getting tiles in order to build a machine to get goods and exchange them for victory points, in the same vein as [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=245&Itemid=1]Phoenicia[/url][/i], but simpler and more condescending.  It uses the [i]Amun-Re[/i] bid system.

VERY fun game, I'm always up for playing this but never twice in a row.  Some buildings are just "good" strategies to go for, but that's balanced by the auctions.  If you want a building bad enough, you have to be ready to fight for it.  Love it.

Quick little engine building game with a good theme--should be played in less than one hour.  Nothing seems particularly fresh about the design, but I can see a fair amount of replayability until you have tried out each of the "unique" special buildings.  The bidding mechanism works well to produce some variability.  Too bad about the physical production, but not a showstopper.

For what is essentially "just" an auction game, I was entertained by both the thematic effort (the pieces helped a lot) and the sheer nastiness of the timing effects produced by the auction.

For me, the tricksy market system (whereby you need "trading tokens" in order to be able to do anything) was perhaps a little too irritating, but everything hung together well.

9/3/09: I'm so excited this game is finally coming out! We get the pre-production proofs this weekend!

I think alexfrog has done a great job balancing all the various buildings in the game, and there's really a lot of emergent strategy that comes out of every play. As an example, the last game I played had a 1 point margin between the top 2 players: 1 player was broke the whole game, took a lot of debt and sold some goods to pay for auctions, was using Gold to pay for 5 workers (which is a lousy use for Gold, and a lot of workers), and yet refused to pass and build up some cash. He scored the majority of his points from selling cubes and a particular building that has 2 worker slots yielding 2 points each. The other passed almost 1/2 of the rounds, was very careful about which buildings he bought so that they were all complimentary and scored large bonuses off of them. These 2 players were 1 point apart, with the broke guy winning. If there were 2 more diametrically opposed strategies in a game, then I'm sure I've never seen them, and these two both worked well.

This game is a definite keeper in my book.  My only play was with 3, but I think that Homesteaders is like World Without End in that to get the true effect of the tightness of buildings and bidding, you need to play with 4.  The auctions play pretty quickly and if everyone handles their income at the same time, the game flies by.  All of the elements mesh together pretty well and I look forward to playing it again, hopefully with 4.

Played at 2012 Spring Gaming Hoopla. Wasn't sure what to think of this one when I signed up, but I quite liked it, even though I got my butt kicked. The resource management and trading, and the limited availability of buildings that you can buy keeps you on your toes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Played this 10 times and counting, at all player counts. Homesteaders has players bidding to construct a certain type of building, and buildings form an engine which generates more resources, VP or other effects for them. While the multitude of buildings and resources can appear intimidating for the new player, it doesn't take long to familiarise oneself with the combinations of buildings. 

I find Homesteaders a brilliant auction and debt management game. The multi-layered auction format used has players thinking not only whether to up their bid, but to move their bid somewhere else. The fact that the values you can bid are fixed only makes things more tricky. The accumulation of debt (which is a necessity in this game) may also look daunting, but having a little left over at the end doesn't really hurt, prompting players to carefully manage their finances.

The resource management part of Homesteaders is probably the only real negative aspect to it. Collecting your income, coupled with buying and selling resources tends to get fairly chaotic. While it is important to pay attention to what resources and buildings your opponents are acquiring, it is just so messy that it's easier to simply concentrate on what you're doing. It also requires some number-crunching towards the end, so the last two rounds tend to grind a bit. Quibbles aside, Homesteaders packs a lot of punch for its relatively short playing time.

Preordered.

Component quality is actually ok. It's just the printer's production values that let it down. What do I mean? The die cutting on the tiles were terrible. Their machines were misaligned and mispunched many flats. This means that many of the tokens and auction tiles are cut waaayyy off center.

Seems like the printer also rushed the job and didn't allow time for the inks to dry. Lots of smudging as the sheets rubbed against each other.

The rulebook was also crinkled from the damp. The staples on the Terra Prime rulebook were rusty on mine! WOW!

Anyway, looking forward to playing the game. Seems like it could work really well!

Vegyük a Caylus épületes és kegyes megoldását, kicsit módosítsunk rajta, vegyük a Puerto Rico munkáselosztását, kicsit módosítsunk rajta és vegyük az Amun-re licitmegoldását, kicsit módosítsunk rajta és kész is van a Homesteaders. Gyanítom, hogy az árucserelehetőség is származik valamiből kicsit módosítva. Szóval nagynevű játékok jó mechanizmusait gyúrta össze a szerző a Homesteadersben és mégis elég jó helyet foglal el a BGG-n, pedig semmi új nincs a játékban. Az első kiadás minősége sok kívánnivalót is hagy maga után, de mivel ezt később javították, erre nem lehet már panasz. Amerikai telepesek vagyunk, akik földet kaptak és ezt próbáljuk minél jobb várossá fejleszteni. Épületeket veszünk, amik vagy nyersanyagot termelnek vagy különböző módon hoznak győzelmi pontot. Fix 10 körös a játék és annyira nem vészesen hosszú, mégis a rengeteg lehetőség az épületek terén AP veszélyessé teheti. A piaci cserélhetőségi lehetőségek is első játékra azért nem könnyen átláthatók, de valószínűsítem, hogy mind az épületek, mind a piac 2-3 játék után már semmilyen nehézséget nem okoz. Minden piaci eladás győzelmi pontot hoz, így elképzelhető, hogy erős stratégia építhető egy kevés épületes csak piacolással megoldott győzelmi pontszerzésre. Ha korábban ismerem meg a játékot, még tetszene is, de így a nagy elődöket látva nekem semmi olyat nem hozott, amiért ezt venném elő. Jó iparosmunka, de semmi több.

Initial impressions, still need to explore it more.  I like that it's a tight economic game, and I like the tech-tree nature of how the buildings play out.  

This game feels like it requires some level of frequent play with a group, so that everybody can start developing strategies about which buildings to go after.  I think for a group such as mine, this game would not get played frequently enough for us to really understand or enjoy it.  There are also some concerns about it getting really fiddly as the game progresses.

An interesting worker-allocation economic engine game, but the production could have used a few improvements. Use auctions to win the right to build certain types of buildings, with specific buildings appearing (and disappearing) in stages through the game. The buildings develop a sort of tech-tree, with combinations that allow you to combine their powers to greater effect (to generate VP). Plays relatively quickly, with some tight auctions (Evo-style) and interesting game play. A bit fiddly (you can collect a lot of little bits, and then have to figure out how to convert them into more valuable bits). Also, the physical production could use some work (except that the cows are AWESOME!): bigger/more informative player screens/aids (helpful to know the tech tree), round number info more visible, bigger development track boxes (so you can see what the next bonus is even if cubes present), easier-to-read fonts on the buildings, etc.

Overall, though, a pretty fun game -- need to play it again!

--- Summary ---
10 rounds. Setup: sort auction cards in order. Sort buildings by phase (settlement->town->city), and display the settlement buildings first. Each player gets a worker and some money. Each round, reveal n-1 tiles to auction. Players allocate their worker(s) amongst all buildings, then collect their income (cash and/or goods). Then auction the tiles, which allow players to build buildings of the specified type (industrial, residential, etc.). Bidding is like in Evo (use the printed track; if you're overbid, move your bid on your turn). Players who pass get a bonus (depending on how often they've passed, their options for the bonus improve). After auction resolved, start player = winner of 1st auction. In turn order, winning bidders may build a building of the appropriate type. 

After 10 rounds, there is one final income phase. Then convert all your accumulated stuff into VP chits as best you can. Add up VP earned during game (from specific buildings), building VP (like the big buildings in Puerto Rico), and VP from cash and the high-value goods; most VP wins!

I love these types of games where you're building your economic engine.  One caveat is there may not be enough randomness with the cards, but I think the auctions instill enough variability to keep the game fresh.  One of those that I really want to play again!

RATING: 8
This is an auction game where the auctions you are bidding on are the "rights" to build certain kinds of buildings into your homestead.  Each round players will receive income of different resources from the buildings they already have and then bid on which buildings they will get to buy for the following round.  There is always one less auction to be won than the number of players but whoever doesn't win an auction gets a consolation prize of moving up on the railroad track which provides bonus resources for free.

I don't typically like auction games where the auction has to follow a rigid form, which this game has (I especially don't like the numbered tile auctions of Ra).  However, I think while the auctions are a big part of the game, there is enough of the rest of the game here that this doesn't bother me.  Actually bidding on and winning the auctions is less important than formulating a strategy, putting together the right combination of buildings, and managing the very, very tight resources.

Money especially is very tight, this is used to win auctions as well as trade for resources that you don't produce.  And it is going to be almost impossible for you to produce each resource you need, there are a lot of resources in the game.  Each player in my first game of this had to take on at least 1 debt token and debt doesn't play around in this game.  Each debt token gives you only 2 coins and the interest is 150% by game end, requiring you to pay back 5 coins or lose an exponential amount of points.  Yet taking on debt is almost essential to playing this game properly (and there are buildings that will help reduce your debt, to be fair).

The different abilities on the buildings give this game some variability as you can pursue different strategies each game depending on what other players do and the order of auctions that come out.  All in all a very nice game although there isn't a HUGE amount of buildings and they don't do a huge amount of different things so it probably doesn't have the longest shelf life.

Production is lousy. I don't like the system of play. I understand that it isn't the game fault but I really don't like the mess of trading something for something and everything can be tradable. Not my cup of tea.

It plays a like a worker placement game but the main mechanism is actually auction and then probably the collection of various buildings (which offer you different types of resources where you sometimes need to place a worker). If you are looking for a decent Euro, this could be it. The ten rounds can play kind of quick, we played with 3 which seemed a good number. I liked this, it is one of those that I would not call exciting but in the right mood for some calm Euro-ing this is a good choice. PS. I found some distant reminiscences of Puerto Rico and I like this one better.

RATING: 7
V impressed after one play. The combination of valuing the right to build and knowing the rigght thing to build is very clever, as is the interactions of the buildings. Timing the auction to miss but making opponets pay fair value is intersting as well. The ability to plan is there but the auction mechanic makes it difficult to guarantee getting the building you need. 

Componenets not great but it s not an expensive game and forgiven for a debut.

As you only have 10 rounds (and in two - four you are passing) it makes the game very intense and a little unforgiving.

In second game found myself at the mercy of new players who did not knbow how to value an auction and wonder if it is very easy for your game to be affected negatively  by others mistakes

Rating could go up with more plays, reminds a little of Le Havre/Caylus et al.

I’ve heard good things about this game from a bunch of people I trust so I was exited to play this and I was not disappointed.  It can get a little mathy and turns can drag when players are trying to plan their resource production, but the game is tight and there are plenty of victory paths.  I have only played a few times so far, but it seems there could be over a half dozen different strategies.  For example I was told that you should always get a market or farm right away.  Well I ended up going foundry, pass, railworks house and then went to town with a railway strategy.  I didn’t win, but it seemed unorthodox and I came within a point of winning.   The open market is a breath of fresh air.  I like having the freedom of trading for resources that I do not have access to otherwise.

Wow this is looking to be a great game!  Many shades of variations of paths to victory with lots of options each turn.  The time to play is much longer than expected, at least for the first couple games, as you learn what all the buildings do, and how they might produce VPs for you.  Our first game was very tight, and everyone had a slightly different strategy.  Was fun and interesting to see prices for properties skyrocket from one turn to the next--for the exact same properties...if only I knew then what I know now, syndrome...suddenly everyone needed to get a couple specific buildings to optimize their paths.

Component quality is more than adequate, but if you expect everything to look like Fantasy Flight games, it's not near that.  for us, the games are far more important than how they look, and we happily play Winsome games, 18xx kits, whatever...as long as the game is there the look is immaterial.  As far as the backs of the auction tiles being "marked," that's patently ridiculous.  The first thing anyone I want to play games with must know is: Don't cheat PERIOD.  So you shuffle while looking away, big deal.  It's only few tile.  Once they're stacked, there are NO backs which are visible.  The top tile is flipped to be face up each turn, covering the rest of the tiles...you cannot see the backs.  Now sure, you could try and look when the tile is flipped...but DON'T.  More than likely any foreknowledge is not going to help you anyway.  You could, potentially hold more of your money for the next round, but that still might not help you win that auction, and certainly won't necessarily win you the game.  But still, don't cheat.

I swear this kind of complaint irks me.  What do these people who complain do, play cards with people who try and look at your hand?  Why are they even playing with these people?  Do they try and peek behind player screens?  Do they get up "to go to the bathroom" so they can look at what the other players have as they return to the table?  really?

When I saw all the available resources plus the conversion chart I was ready to hate this game, but turns out it's pretty good game.

It has all the element you would find in your typical euro, but somehow in a package that still feel fresh. The far-west village building works for me. For once you can honestly say that this game has multiple paths to victory. I really like the use of the trade token.

It's really hard to visualize the final scoring on your first game. It's the same with figuring out what to build and what resources you will need later. Finally it is fiddly and the auction doesn't do much for me.

When I look under the hood of this game, I'm in awe of the mechanisms that I see before me.  It's a tightly designed, minimal fluff, economic engine game centred around auctions that provides non-stop difficult decision-making.  Yet the thematic gamer in me can't help noticing that, on the exterior, it is yet another dry, Euroey, efficiency exercise.  So that's my conflict: it's a fantastic design (how many hours must they have spent balancing the abilities of all those buildings?!), but how much fun is it?  I admit that I tend to dislike games centered around auctions, but I do rather enjoy the "bumping" style of auction that is found in this, and a few other, games (though I didn't end up being really wowed by Cyclades either, come to think of it).  The visuals don't help the theme shine either.  While the wooden components are great, the artwork on everything else is very... beige.  I suppose the chosen theme is a good one given the nature of the game, and the difficulties of being a homesteader certainly come through in the constant level of frustration that a player feels in trying to get that economic engine turning over whilst being thwarted by her/his opponents at every turn.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 7/10

RATING: 7.5
Economic snowball game over ten rounds of Amun Re style auctions. Players bid for the rights to build four types of buildings in a settlement in the Old West, which grows through three ages from a Settlement to a Town and finally to a City. Settlement buildings generally provide resources, while City buildings almost exclusively provide victory points. 

Perhaps most interesting is the system of debt: players can always take $2 loans ($5 to pay off), which are worth -1/-2/-3/-4/... points each (so your tenth loan is -10VP). The result is that no-one ever drops out of an auction for lack of money, but because they pass a threshold where the expected value is too low to justify another loan.

Things-into-other-things resource-management isn't a genre I particularly enjoy, but Homesteaders is short and sweet enough to make me prefer it over other somewhat similar games which with broader scope but substantially longer playtime, such as Through the Ages and Le Havre.

This is a great economic engine game.  I love the multiple paths to victory and that they all seem to be balanced.  I will certainly play this one if asked.

The components are okay, but not great.  The price is fairly low and this is a smaller publisher so I can cut some slack.

Building powers in a very tight economic race. The auction makes this one confrontational as one person will always get locked out of building. Plays fairly fast for as much as is involved in this great economic game.

Take Agricola (resources), add a part of Caylus (king favour), shake it with Amun-Re (bidding system) and serve in a western saloon. The result could be even good, but it's too complicated for what I was expecting. It's all a matter of finding the best combo with a bunch of things to look at. Nice but not great.

A wonderfully fast and just thought requiring bidding/optimisation game. With three players (who all play quickly) this took 40 minutes; for that amount of time, there is an excellent amount of 'game' in here.

Repeat plays are required to see if this stands up, but this is a great little game!

I don't tend to like games with "too many" resource types. Stone Age is an exception because the relation between the types is so simple. Homesteaders seems to use different resources to make the economics of the game harder to grasp (contrast: St. Petersburg). Trade tokens are pretty much a trap for newbies. The game is rather fiddly, and staged (different cards are used for turns 1-5, 6-8, and 9-10), which I dislike.

With all these negatives, I still like the game.

Functionally everything is good, but the physical implementation of the game is very uneven. Cattle are beautiful and two-colored. Gold is your basic yellow disk. Cards and tokens are very sturdy cardboard, badly printed--registration was way off on the tokens. The cards would have been better as normal playing cards--even Artscow quality. The board is too thin and flimsy--it needed the thick cardboard.

As I write this, yet another revision of Traumfabrik / Hollywood Blockbuster is out, Drean Factory, and revisions are in the works for Goa(!), Industria, and Factory Fun. Homesteaders could really use a revised version.

I enjoy building up the town, and the auction phase scales well between 2-4 players. There seem to be sets of buildings that maximize points/money (but not all buildings belong to sets). It takes time to learn the game and maximize points. That can be frustrating to newcomers.

This has been a pleasant surprise so far.  I really enjoy the liquidity of all of the goods, since anything can be cashed in and turned into just about anything else, so long as you have the trade tokens to do so.  This removes the frustration of absolutely needing one particular thing and being unable to get it.  It's still more efficient to get precisely the goods you need to begin with of course!  The auction system is tight and can reward the one player who doesn't win an auction by driving the prices up for the others.  I also like how debt works (you can take debt at any time).  That means you can always have enough silver on hand to buy anything.  Whether it's worth it is another problem altogether!

Really enjoyed this game the one time I've played it.  The tokens really made it easy to remember what was what (instead of the abstract nature of many games').

RATING: 6
A bid-and-build economic engine game that featues a very "clean" and "sharp" design. It is the simple elegance of the game - there are no unnecessary, fiddly frills - that is its main attraction. It will probably take new players  a while to get a handle on relative auction values, but otherwise Homesteaders is relatively accessible to new payers and easier to teach and grok than many city building/economic games. I like the game, but not enough to keep it in my collection ... it's just a bit too dry for my tastes, perhaps a downside to its clean and simple design.

What can I say other than I love this game.  My fist play was a 2 player game which I enjoyed immensely.  After playing a 4 player game I'm starting to see the full potential of what this game has to offer with many paths to victory.  I love how you can win without ever having or producing an apple for example.  I love how you're never truly out of an auction because you can take debt tokens.  Its your call how far into the hole you are willing to go.  Many meaningful decisions here.

I was very surprised by this game. I did not have high expectations going in, but the game was quite exceptional. Only played three player so far, but 4 player could be even better. So many buildings allow for lots of different strategies. I can't wait to explore this further. Tons of cardboard (little wet at first) and nice wood bits. Great value for the money.

RATING: 6
It may be that Homesteaders is TOO polished.  As a gamer's game, it samples notes from many favorites, with a pawn-based auction here, some unique resources to convert there, a touch of city building, tech trees to be exploited or ignored, and so on. The result is a smooth and impressive synthesis that hums gently.  But Homesteaders lacks excitement.  It's a squinter's paradise with a tabletop of tiles and their costs and benefits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fair enough. This is a mish-mash of games and mechanics that is very low on theme, not the most exciting game. Not by far! But it sure doesn't hurt playing it. I'm a little disappointed with the artwork though. The components do have quite a bit of chrome but having only one picture for each different building type instead of for every unique building makes the grapics really drab and boring. 

Summary: I wouldn't mind playing it again, but this is a perfect candidate for my For trade-List as I see no reason why I would need to own this.

Great game, very good components. Similar to Puerto Rico in that you acquire buildings that give you certain abilities, but also has an auction and some small worker placement aspects.

I just don't rate it higher because of my personal gaming tastes. This game requires you to take lots of resources that you don't need and then convert them to the ones you need. This makes the game more AP prone because you always have to think of the different conversion rates.

Sold.

A fun game to play with the older kids. The scarcity of resources and need to bid on auctions keeps them engaged throughout the game and they say they feel like they wish it could keep going. They feel like they're just getting rolling when it comes to an end. Of course that makes them just want to start over again right away.

First Impression:
A tight resource management euro.

There is a steady progress in this game, and some quite hard decisions hidden in its simple auction heart. The interaction is very good, and every decision matters as you build your resource engine which can't really provide everything. I particularly like the trade mechanic, which pretty much means that "you can do anything you want, but not as many times as you want!). Finally, and quite unexpectadly, the game did deliver its theme to me. I did feel like I was building up a settlement/homestead, as I should.

On the bad side, and even though I usually do like tight euros I felt restricted in a bad way at the start of the game. The loans and the market does help somewhay, but the truth is that you need to pull some hard combos straight from the beggining if you want to put a leg to the game. This tightness then slowly lifts off as you have more and more resources each round, which is the reverse of what I like.

Overall homesteaders is a fine game, and I'd like to play it again.

Wow what a great game. Very nice little western theme (and I'm a sucker for western themed games) that plays fast, has a lot of choices, that cool Amun-Re/Vegas Showdown bidding mechanic and is just a fun game that plays in under an hour...at least with 3 players. it only seats 4 at most so really it's going to hold to that pretty nicely. I had fun with it...now to see if the official 2 player variant is good as well!

UPDATE: 2 Player variant works great. Bidding can still be fought over though it does seems like opening bid is always going to be the same or one more than the neutral player. Tension for buildings is still high as there are only 1 of each. Works great.

This is a solid game. Simple rules, and very open in the outcome. Not all auctions are tense, but some of them are thrilling and most likely determine the game. Not for players prone to analysis/paralysis. The components are great. There are complaints about them but I found them of great quality and provide a nice tone accordingly to the era. I love the cows!!! Very well tuned game that results in a real economic puzzle. I hope they come out with an expansion that brings randomness in what buildings are available each game (or each turn).

I really like the design, color scheme and cardboard components.  The wooden bits and the breakable cow weren't quite as impressive.  I like the game design too.  Knowing the cards would be a big advantage... so I hope to do better in subsequent plays.  Saving up resources the turn the era changes is a good idea.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=26566][/thing] is an auction/building combo game. Every turn, after an income phase, and the workers placement phase, the players bid for a building permit of some kind (some with restrictions to what to build and others with one-time benefits when purchased). After the auction phase, the player who was outbid and passed, advance in a track that give this player with some things depending in the place the player is (he/she can always choose a benefit for the place he/she is, or from any of the places behind). The players that acquire the permits, now, in the permits order, choose a building to build (usually the buildings will allow a player to receive a resource in the income phase, and/or come with a place for workers to be placed, and/or will be worth victory points). When the building phase ends, the same happens to the round. Ten rounds and the game is over. [thing=26566][/thing] is indeed a quick game, but with a lot of meat in the bones.

The money and resources in [thing=26566][/thing] are tight, so using the market to sell/buy things happens often (and is allowed at any moment), and acquiring debits (that take points at the end of the game if not paid - you gain $2, but must pay $5) is also usual (but should be avoid to happen often, unless you are sure you will get the Bank).

The are, in the game, four types of buildings:
- Industrial (gold mine, copper mine, forgery, etc);
- Residencial (ranch, boarding house, church, etc);
- Comercial (stables, general store, bank, etc);
- Special (rodeo, factory, fairgrounds, etc).

As I said, [thing=26566][/thing] is a game to make combo of buildings - be for money, resources and/or points. The types of buildings don't change, but the buildings itself do: they start at the level of settlement, then to town, and finally city - and the requirements to build them gets steeper, and the benefits, of course, are better.

[thing=26566][/thing] comes with a ton of components, all of great quality (probably due to the problems that the first edition of the game had), and the artwork works well.

The gameplay is easy to get into and the choices, though not really hard to be made, offers many possibilities. The game last for around one hour to 70 minutes (the 90 minutes playing time seems to happen only if the players really took their time in their plays).

I enjoyed [thing=26566][/thing] quite a bit and will be willing to play it again.

The Vegas Showdown-style bidding works well, and the fact that someone HAS to pass is a nice touch. It adds a lot of pressure to the auctions, with some do-or-die scenarios. It is pretty fast-moving, too, with the end of the game taking everyone by surprise even though it's totally known how long it is. At first there was some information overload,  but in time we've gotten more used to it and have learned to really love it.

I really like Homesteaders.  Tough choices in both worker placement and auctions make it a tight game.  The addition of auction order means the same building type up for auction on different tracks means they are not worth the same as the building you want may be gone.  Possible issue with not enough buildings, but with more plays I will adjust my score (currently 5 or so plays, only 1 logged).

I like games with a bidding component, and Homesteaders is no exception. I also like the fact that the game plays pretty fast for a medium-weight Euro with some hard choices. It feels very streamlined. Lastly, I appreciate the fact that buildings that have not been chosen are removed from the game after a few turns - making the selection of which building to build even harder. I am not a big fan of the artwork on the tiles (too clean), but other than that, there is really nothing wrong with what's on offer here. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In the grand tradition of games that forces players to develop an economic engine to churn out victory points, Homesteaders is one such entry in this crowded genre. The game has two distinct halves: the auction phase and the building phase. Silver coins are required for the auction phase while standard resources are need to construct the buildings. To win the game, one needs to understand the relationship between these two phases of the game and adjust accordingly based on the opponents playing the game. Some players may bid aggressively while others tend to be more conservative. Finding a right balance depends on your opponents' gameplay. I find the game quite streamlined without a whole lot of bloat. The trade chits represent another form of currency which is equally important for trade but I am a little unclear of its necessity. Players build the engine for roughly 8 rounds with intermittent victory point accumulation followed by the "big buildings" in the final two rounds. I find the interplay between the auction and the building purchases to have a lot of depth. I am sure it will be a This game reminds me a bit of St. Petersburg where money is tight and one has to consider switching between generating resources and generating victory points. Solid game, not really novel so some other game may fit this genre in your collection (Gates of Loyang, St. Petersburg, etc).

Good game, but this is a very crowded genre.  At heart, this is another game where you collect a whole lot of resources, convert them into other resources, and use them to build buildings that give you VPs.  Given designer Alex Rockwell's track record, I have no doubt that this is impeccably balanced and incredibly deep, but I just don't need another game that does this.   It's a bit too dry, and is a bit too scripted, as there's very little difference in the game beyond what the auctions are from turn to turn.  People who love this kind of thing will love this game, but I'll pass.

Literally a building game, as each player builds a town up from just a homestead. Gather resources, bid on building permits, and build buildings which give you more resources, vps, or other benefits. Neat system of needing workers to place in your buildings to gather resources or points, many buildings offering a choice of items if you don't have enough workers to man every spot. 

Vegas Showdown style auction with a nasty twist, there are only N-1 items available to N players, so at least one person must drop out of every auction and take a small consolation prize. Fantastic brinksmanship feeling as you decide to drop out or bid higher. 

Tons of different strategies are available, as most buildings are unique, so each player's little town grows up differently.

(1.28.10)  After 1 3p game I really enjoyed playing the game.  In our learning game I zigged when other zagged and ended up with some nice opportunities along the way to build for big points.

Commented after one game. Worker placement game with nice theme and structure. Lots to do during a turn. Components are mostly nice, but some of them were quite moldy and the cardboard components had a moist feel.

Updated after second play and almost three years. Others had more recent plays, so I was a little bit underdog - no long term plans. The game is rather quick, it is really faster than you would think when you see the huge pile of components. This time the components felt okay, no problems with them.

A lot of games get hyped as "compressing a heavy game experience into a 60-90 minute game". A good recent example is Endeavor, but that game and many before have failed to excite me because they feel watered down and lack that "it" factor. 

Homesteaders is finally the game that delivers the goods. It packs a heavy game into a 60-90 minute time frame (even accounting for AP types). Those who on principle demand innovative mechanics will guffaw at this game, but while it does nothing new it does what it does very well. Alex Rockwell, the designer, has played over 1000 games of Puerto Rico and has similarly played the crap out of other games like Caylus and Power Grid. Quite simply it shows- this is a fine tuned design that provides tense decisions and genuinely multiple paths to victory (so rare in these types of games). 

What most impresses me about Homesteaders is that it seamlessly weaves the whole resource manipulation/tech tree aspect (which by itself would make a dry and potentially solvable game) with these really tense auctions that shine because money is so tight that you really have to carefully consider how high you're willing to go. Sure, the game in essence is just a series of 10 auctions, yet the economic system is what makes them so interesting and dynamic.

RATING: 5
The game itself isn't bad, but it's not all that original.  It borrows a great deal from other Euros, but doesn't feel like something new and interesting.  There are certainly some decisions to make, and different strategies to take you through the game, it just doesn't make much of an impression.  Folks might like it for its theme, but for me, it just felt bland.

All that aside, this is one of the worst produced games I've ever seen, and that's saying something, because I own a copy of Phoenicia.  The main board is thinner than standard card stock, the cardboard tiles and chits are horribly offset, and from what I've heard, most games were shrinkwrapped while still damp.  If the game is good enough, I could overlook all that, but DAMN.  Don't count on me ever buying a copy of this one.

A nice, quick playing auction game. I think there's a lot to be said for purchasing buildings that will complement each other. It would be fun to try this one again now that I know how important building combos are to gameplay.

UPDATE:  I did much better on my second run through when thinking about building combos, but I think this could be a bit of a stumbling block for new players.  It would definitely be an advantage to be familiar with the different buildings that are coming up in the auctions.

Bought because Alex seems like a cool guy.

After a solo learning game, it seems like a solid design in a very crowded field. For me, the opportunity cost to get this on the table is probably just too high (I don't play games 20+ hours a week, unlike most BGGers, apparently).

Tempted to pick up 2nd edition, though, as it really is a solid design.

Seems likely to be best with 4, but 3 player game was engaging.  This game struck a chord with both the Knizia, auction-loving crowd and the Euro conversion engine crowd.  Will definitely see more playing time.

Good game! Don't let the minor production problems of the 1st edition keep you away.
No, it's nothing revolutionary, but the mechanics are well integrated, and there are a few new things that I really like here (like the Trade Chit problem: you need a Trade Chit whenever you make a transaction at the marketplace, even if you have enough money and/or resources...).
Looking forward to my next game.

Better than it looks at first (even if you need 11/10 eyesight to read the tiny letters). A developement game in just 10 turns, the nice thing is it has a limited playing time and you have to develop your strategy in a very short amount of time.
Mechanics are quite unoriginal

Really liked it. Tons of buildings for different directions and a semi-scripted order forces you to plan ahead and really manage resources. We weren't bidding very aggressively so not many loans were taken. I expect a few things to change as the game gets played more. It was kind of nice to have to actually rely on the market to trade/sell as you really are only managing a few resources at a time, you'll never be swimming in them like other games. You have to make the best with a small amount.

2-player is surprisingly nice. The neutral bid token forces prices up a bit but I think the big driving force in 2-player is the shortage of key buildings since there is only one copy of everything (outside of settlements). Bids were generally higher too. Played in about an hour even with rust, I enjoyed it as much (if not more) than the 3-player games.

This game is one that my wife really loves! It is like a simpler version of La Havre.  However, other players can't use your buildings that you build. This game also has an auction mechanic in it which is fun to explore. I enjoy the different types of bits and resources. The second edition was made very well.

feels very cheaply made, and the type on the components is so small, we all had to squint.  but, it's a fun auction/resource management game, with some depth.  not sure how long the interest will last.

Too AP prone and too much of a solitaire feel to it. Player interaction comes from the bidding only. The buildings are rather interesting though.

this game is a great economic engine builder with bidding and worker placement, a 2nd edition with a few tweaks and better carboard stuff might raise it to a 9, the wood bits are cool...(update: upgraded to 2nd edition)

The auctions can get pretty tense in this one and you're always scraping for cash and piling up debt, but this is offset by worker placement without competition so you won't see your well laid plans crumble.  A clever twist where trading with the board becoming a commodity makes it fun to swap your resources all over the place. Lots of important decisions in a short period of time finish this out to be a real Euro Gamer's Euro!

An optimization game at its heart, Homesteaders doesn't reinvent the wheel, instead, it took some of the best mechanics and melded them into something that is both familiar and different at the same time.  For a total of 10 turns, players get the chance to bid on the right to construct buildings that will generate money, goods, VP and/or actions.  However, not everyone will get or even want to do that, so another option in the form of a railroad track (a name which I don't get at all, especially since only one of the choices offered has anything to do with railroad) is available.

In its current prototype form, I've found the disparity between the three types of resources to be somewhat disconcerting.  Actions, the driving force in the market as well as some of the activation costs of the buildings, seemed almost too powerful.  Of course it is best to take a balanced approach when gathering your income, but as long as one has a monopoly and a healthy revenue of actions, he can turn one coin or one cube into multiples of either.  For me, that felt like an opportunity riped for abuse.

One thing I thought was kind of too lenient was the ability to utilize the market during the build phase, even though it is suppose to take place after in the official turn sequence (not sure if we were playing a variant or if it has been revised).  Coupled with the fact that you can borrow at any time, the result was you were never required to have the money or the goods up front, the game thus degenerated into who was more willing to go into debt to get what he wanted.  Totally negating the tension of being able to manage one's resource well.

You won't find much innovation in Homesteaders' gameplay, but that isn't always a bad thing.  I enjoyed my experience with it and am looking forward to further refinement by the designer.

A quicker Puerto Rico variant, with an auction system in place of role selection.  Bid on the ability to build buildings, collect resources off those buildings, use resources to build better buildings.  At the end build big expensive buildings that give you lots of points.

Beautiful wood-composite(?) components and heavy cardboard tiles, and the board is a dead-on imitation of an old-West deed or legal document.

After 1 play, very Puerto Rico-ish, but fun.  Causes a bit of analysis paralysis during the auction which would be my only real complaint.  I might worry that the game could degenerate into a chess like match where everyone is focusing on remembering what each person has behind their screen, causing the game to drag on.  Hopefully the length improves with multiple plays and familiarity.

After 1 Play: In the vein on Amun-Re or Princes of Florence, where the auction is your only interaction with other players.  The rest is just running your engine.  On the plus side the pieces are pretty neat, and the trade tokens are a really cool idea that I hope is mimicked in other games

Played it again, not sure why I enjoyed it so much the first time. It has some charms, though, so only a minor subtraction.

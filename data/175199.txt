There are lots of bits which aren't intuitive (thematically or otherwise), but I get why they work mechanically (e.g. the cards not entering your hand instantly and how backorders work). I've taught a bunch of other people to play so far and those who played GtR first picked it up faster, but ultimately had different problems, while those who were band new to Chudyk's games sort of got lost for a good portion of the game. A bit about the former demographic; most of us were accustomed to burning one action and thinking to refill a hand, so we want to deplete our hand and do things, but we need to remember to balance that with burning actions to keep cards flowing into our hands. That's one element of the flow that's different. A second one is in terms of crafting. I get that this is a retheme of Architect, but it's approaching convoluted and prohibitive to pull off. This by far has been the biggest stumbling block we've seen with explaining the game; how crafting in general works and how its different than Smithing. Like all of Chudyk's games, you have to play a handful of games first to understand what's going on.

I *do* like the action chaining effect of do their task then yours compared to a straight phase selection (ala GtR/Puerto Rico et al) for action planning and drawing cards (as a long term planning focus while just sort of cherry picking what they do instead of optimizing around it). Still has strategy, but it's different and while it's seat-dependent, that's diminished and it plays out in a different way. I like that the deck is small and we're working on a hyper efficient system. Last, I like that it's a quick game, taking about the same amount of time at GtR at 2p and slightly less time at higher counts.

I don't think it's bad, it's certainly a Chudyk game (the game-breaking-rocket-ending effect you get in GtR is slower to go off, but when it does, it seems more explosive, maybe that's as a result of the combo nature of Mottainai). Ultimately though, I don't think it's better than GtR, but it's certainly a worthy contender (especially at it's price), and for those who don't have GtR or can't afford a copy, it's attractive and recommended.

Update: 20+ plays in, I enjoy the game, and see that it has a spot in my collection (especially since it's small). It's super convoluted/opaque in terms of anything outside of straight turn optimization (which isn't easy to do either) and that's the biggest barrier to getting people to play it.

I'm a huge fan of Glory to Rome and I really expected to enjoy Mottainai as much too.

But it just seemed to drag in comparison.  The floor (GtR = pool) quickly drained completely from its starting 3 cards (3 players), meaning the only card available to you to take from it on your turn was the one you just discarded as the old task from the previous round.

It was frequently the case that the helpers (GtR = clientele) therefore couldn't get any more cards from the floor for you and were often reduced to one of their backup actions, that of drawing a single card from the deck (the other alternate action of crafting had requirements you often couldn't meet).

You'd need a tailor to dump unwanted cards and draw back up to 5 (although you can't use the replacements this turn) but again, if you don't have a tailor you can only draw 1 card and hope it's what you need. Having a 5 card hand size limit applied, with one of those being played as your task, means you'll have at most 4 cards in hand to do something with;  it's frequently less.

There is no Jack (GtR wildcard) so if you don't draw the right cards you are stuck.

In GtR the flow of play moves very quickly with everyone involved all the time, because they can "follow" the lead of the active player and do the same action during the active player's turn.  Even if you don't follow, you can "think" and get your hand size back up to a healthy number. So everyone is engaged all the time and there is no downtime.

In Mottainai the active player performs the task (GtR = role) of each other player first, probably multiple times thanks to any matching helpers, before doing their own task + helpers.  That can take a long time.  And it will probably empty the floor.

Then when things seemed to be picking up as a few more cards arrived on the floor so we actually had choices to pick from, the last card from the (small) deck was drawn and the game ended.

Overall the experience was frustrating more than rewarding. Can't see why I'd play this again when we have GtR.

[thing=19857][/thing] is more thematic, more polished, more difficult to learn, but with a more rewarding learning curve, and overall a far better game. Mottainai is proof positive that a stupid theme can kill a game faster than anything. Why are your monks picking artifacts up off the floor? What? Glory to Rome may not be an especially thematic game, but the theme doesn't detract from the mechanics. Mottainai picks up a poorer theme, and, to add insult to injury, muddies the mechanics that make Glory to Rome so great. 

The simultaneous, same-turn leading/following is fantastic in Glory to Rome -- Mottainai puts your follows on a one-turn lag. Similarly, the 40 or so buildings that are in the deck a preset number of times allows you to plan a certain strategy and adapt as different cards come out -- Mottainai ditches that for 100 unique cards that either makes your strategy completely adaptive or dependent on the luck of the draw (I have a similar problem with [thing=217776][/thing]). 

Some people may have fun with and enjoy Mottainai, but it's definitely not for me -- and it's definitely not Glory to Rome. I'm still waiting for that criminally-abused game to come back into print.

Another Chudyk design that doesn't do much for me.  Well, I recognize the design is thoughtful and crafty, but it seems a little over-designed to me.  I dig the multiple use of everything, but the first play didn't grab me; it was quite un-intuitive.  I'm sure folks here will really enjoy it with repeated play, though.

The best of Glory to Rome and Innovation without the worst.  Plays like GtR.  Has wild combos like GtR and Innovation.  Plays quicker than Innovation and slightly less skill-imbalanced (slightly less imbalanced/rewarding for multiple plays).

I love it!

EDIT:  A 5 player teaching game I tried didn't go over so well.  A little too random and slow at 5.  Also, there is a rather *steep* learning curve.  Takes a few plays to wrap your head around it.

RATING: 5
1st play: With Glory to Rome nearly impossible to get and a bit of a nostalgic feeling for it, I backed this game hoping for "the next version" and I was not disappointed.  It doesn't have the same chaotic, overpowered feel (at least not yet) but it's a tighter, more controlled experience.  Managing your hand and deciding where to place the works and which ones to build captures a lot of the cool parts of Glory to Rome.  The art fits the style, and I'm pretty sure with repeat plays the games will go very quick.  I do understand the criticism that the game lacks the same "character" as Glory to Rome though. 

2nd play: The second play was a little smoother, but still I was left feeling like the game fell short. A little less character, a little too tight, a little too far of a gap between theme and mechanics.  The game is decent, but I find myself wanting to play Glory to Rome. Unfair maybe but there it is.

I can see the obvious relationship of this game to Glory to Rome (GTR).  But is it better?  Do I prefer this game to Glory to Rome?  No.  I would MUCH rather play Glory to Rome than this game.

On the positive side, I like the theme and the effort to develop a theme that somehow corresponds to the various stations on the player mats.  Did I buy the theme? No, but I respect the effort.

Likely, my opinion of the game is undoubtedly colored by the fact that we recklessly failed to heed the player count warning in the (badly written) rule book and played this game for the first time with four people.  I found that warning fairly unique, and amusing, but I am guessing that their play-testing revealed something significant enough to warrant a stark warning: playing this game for the first time with four players leads to disaster.  I can certainly confirm that it was a disaster.  Maybe one of the four of us might be willing to play it again (not me). 

In fairness, I can imagine this might be a far better game with two.  I can see other comments suggesting this.  So...perhaps, at some distant time in the future I hope, I will try this two player.

A fair amount of game for such a little deck of cards. Getting your head around how the cards move from your task slot to the floor and then to your helpers, shop, or craft bench and getting them to where you need them when you need them takes several plays to grasp. Great game for 2 players.

I haven't played Glory to Rome, but a few plays of Innovation show that a "Chudyk game" is a legit thing. Definitely has similar shading. While "covering" rules can be extremely hard to explain, at least in my experience, I think it's a game whose rules I'm actually likely to recall after a short refresh. The player aid cards could be even simpler if they skipped works. There are plenty of broken-looking situations and combos, but for a 15-30 minute game, it works. Also like how it can be played side-by-side rather than across-the-table, maybe even best played that way.

I still do not own a copy of Glory of Rome, nor have I played it, but between Mottainai, Innovation and Uchronia I think I get the gist of what it's all about. Here in Mottainai, you've got a very aesthetically simple package which reflects the theme of monks crafting, display and selling various objects. As with those other games, the cards all have multiple uses depending on how you set them up on your home mat, and for that reason this is pretty thinky for a small card game. Deluxe edition comes with an extra deck of cards for the 4-5 player counts, and it was only a few dollars more so worth it. If you like Chudyk's design, this is a natural recommendation and a faster means to experience some of the mechanics he is well known for.

A retheme and reskin of Glory to Rome with all the elements I dislike from that game with additional irritation. The four function cards are a direct clone of GtR but the wording is incredibly obtuse and vague in places. Its never good when you have to lay the card down to encourage debate over what something means amongst the other players. One player even abandoned a card because he couldn't work out what was instructed.

My main criticism is the need to roll with whats dealt and that will either help you or hinder you regardless of what you do. Early on I had a card that could use paper for anything if in my workbench. Sure enough I never drew another paper card .  Such games irritate me beyond measure. A lower rating than for GtR because it's worse.

I have never played Glory to Rome. I've played Innovation but wasn't its biggest fan.

Well the game is certainly... esoteric.

I do wish Asmadi would give up trying to interject thematic names for things that have little to no thematic connection. Helpers and Sales, okay. Gallery? Gift shop? [i]Waiting room? [b]Backorders?[/b][/i] Come on. This is even worse than Red7's Canvas and Palette. Asmadi must come to realise that these made-up names for things actually make the game [i]harder[/i] to learn. I'll take a slapdash theme over an abstract any day, but this theming makes the game worse.

The rulebook isn't bad considering the complexity of the game. The concepts explained early don't make sense at the time, then you read the later parts and you start to get it, then you start over from the beginning and it all makes sense. I don't know it'd be possible to explain it in a way that [i]doesn't[/i] have that problem. Everything's interconnected.

It's one of those games that is complex, and you think it should be strategic so your brain goes into overdrive, but it actually doesn't seem to be. Just play by the seat of your pants. I do that in Innovation and consistently lose, but I did that here and I held my own.

Despite the pretty and approachable art, it isn't a family game. This could be considered another example of poor theming. You look at it and you feel like it's a fun, light game, so casual gamers want to play it, and you kind of have to physically stop them. :)

But engaging and good for gamer families, maybe. I think stick with two or three players. With more there are just so many actions to do, turns could take a really long time.

I like the way it plays, so far, and am looking forward to another play. Don't much care for all the crazy powers on the cards, that's not my preference, but it certainly makes for a bit of a roller coaster experience.

Mottainai was absolutely one of the hardest games to learn. The rulebook is probably decent, but it is a game that you need to see in action in order to understand.

After the first game it 'clicked' and my wife and I have absolutely adored this little game.

I think there's a lot of depth packed into a small package and I'm looking forward to see how it stands up to repeated plays.

I fully expect that Mottainai will be one of our go to travel games and it will get many plays over the years.

Like tonguing a sore - the first play hurt but I want to keep doing it.

In all seriousness, this game is a mess to teach, especially to someone who hasn't played Glory to Rome.  I'm also eternally conflicted over whether it's brilliant or horrendous.  I think it's simultaneously both, suspended in a dual quantum state.

Ultimately though it's a poor man's Glory to Rome and not nearly as good.

A great game for showcasing the difference between mechanics and dynamics. 

Mechanics-wise, it shares a lot with Glory to Rome. Cards with multiple functions played either under your mat or in a tableau, you can do actions that others have done, you can pump up your ability to do actions by hiring people, there's a pool in the centre.

But the game's feel, its dynamics, feel nothing like Glory to Rome. What they feel like is Innovation. It's all about finding one card and hammering away on it until you win (or at least that's what it seemed like in the three games I played). 

However, I'd rather play Innovation as Innovation does that much better. First off, this game can end quite abruptly and quickly, unsatisfyingly so. There are few interesting cards, and few broken cards (unlike Innovation which has plenty of both). But there are broken cards. If you don't draw one (which is likely as there aren't many of them), and thus build one, good luck against someone who does. 

Also, the theme is very poor in this game. In the two parent games, the cards have a connection between what they are and what they do. It helps. This game has no such link.

I love Glory to Rome! It was the first game from Chudyk I played, so I wanted to play a lot of his game, and while Uchronia was ok (GtR is way better), I very much dislike Innovation and Red7 was very meh. But this game is even worse than Innovation... It's short, but short in this game doesn't equal good. It's actually almost too short, so you don't get any engine up and running and it feels like it comes down to luck of the draw who wins. Also, there are certain cards that are much more powerful than others, especially early in the game, and I feel like you can get an unfair advantage just because you luckily drew the right cards. I know that the deck of cards is small, and you will be rewarded if you play it repeatedly and get to know the cards, but the game itself isn't very good so I am unlikely to ever get to know the cards...

So, I'm probably biased. I own and like Glory to Rome.  Mottainai is very similar, but the theme is more obtuse. I don't envy anyone that has to teach this game, as the terminology is not terribly user friendly. 

So maybe I am biased, but I like the rhythm of turns with Glory to Rome much better. I'll play this one again, but only because I'm willing to see if some hidden reward emerges that I missed the first time.

RATING: 8
Tentative rating based on the PnP but this is another great Chudyk card game. Multi-action cards all done with a 54 card deck and lots of game changing abilities between all the works that make each game turn out completely different. The score may change after I get the final version, but I really enjoyed my 2 brief plays of this.

RATING: 6
Quick and enjoyable card game in the Glory to Rome line. Some cards seem overpowered but more plays will tell. Quite dense for what amounts to just a deck of cards. May be too much for beginning gamers to wrap their heads around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So in my capacity as a certified grinch when it comes to this designer, it is my singular pleasure to inform you that I actually quite enjoyed Mottainai. Since I'm zigging where my GeekBuddies zag, I in fact like Mottainai quite a bit more than a number of people who adored Glory to Rome and Innovation, two games that did nada for your faithful reviewer. Working within the confines of a small footprint -- 54 cards, half-hour running time, &c. -- Chudyk has created something quite special. My beef with his predecessor games was the unfortunate tendency towards bloat and excess that did not seem justified by the player's input of effort; I cop freely to this being a psychological block on my part but getting bumped off on a technicality hurts more when you've been playing for an hour than when youve only put in less than half that.

This is a fun thinking person's filler for two (if you can get over the fact that sometimes you just lose and there's not much you can do about it) slash couple's game (if the beta-gamer in the relationship can get over the quite substantial complexity hump; mine did, mostly.)

If you've wanted to try Glory to Rome but couldn't stomach the prices on the secondary market, is this an adequate substitute? People more into the designers' games than I will probably tell you "no," but you can at least take comfort in the fact that there's at least one cranky observer who feels it's actually better...

wtf is going on in this game??

update: 3 plays in and I still can't tell if I like this game. Maybe I do..maybe I hate it..I don't know...

update: love it! After hating my only play of Innovation with such a fury I went into trying Mottainai with a fair amount of trepidation. I played it a few times with a buddy from work and just wasn't sure. Lately I've been playing both hands and it has been fantastic. As you get familiar with the deck and comfortable with the game's unusual tempo the decisions reveal themselves like a tulip opening in the morning.

RATING: 10
Played the PnP version.  The game is excellent and exactly what I like (GtR is one of my top rated games, including the fact that I have the old 3rd edition from the clam shell.); however, I don't see it receiving much play when we already have Glory to Rome and Impulse.  I'd definitely want to have Christine give it a try to see what she thinks.  Christine is wondering the same as I am, does this warrant having when we already have GtR?  Only a few more plays will tell.

OK, so we've decided that the tightness of the game and the slightly different way players interact with each other makes it worth backing.  Into our first Kickstarter!

Our first Kickstarter, and it was totally worth it.  We are not sure how many four or five player games we will have but having the option (as well as the pretty white cards) are worth having.

Wonderful, just great. Tight on hand limit, difficult to set up combos, and full of chaos. Just what you'd expect from a game of cards that advocates efficiency and economy. There is a tremendous amount of game play in this little deck of cards. Just keep in mind that it is probably tough to teach, needs a few games to get the gist of what's happening, and the rules and terminology is a bit iffy at best. Once you get over the learning curve, this will be a game to enjoy for a long time. Best played with 2 players.

Hits the table at home way more often than with my game group. Now that Paul is confident in playing it, I love getting it outâone of my favorite card games.

RATING: 8
It is much more in the Glory to Rome vein. Following is done on your turn, so their isn't a disconnect. Drawing happens at the end of your turn, which seems like a small change, but it not only give you time to examine your new cards so you aren't slowing the game flow, but also gives you more options on your turn. The discarding happens after you know what rolls the opponents are playing.

This game is not "Glory to Rome redux"; it's its own beast.

I like some things about it much, much better. But starting out, it didn't call to me as much. I'm not entirely sure why - perhaps because I find the role names tremendously unintuitive? It made learning the game (and internalizing what Works did) much harder for me.

But my opinion of it has risen on each successive play, and I can easily see that trend continuing.

So I've played Glory to Rome, Uchronia, and now Mottainai, and I've thoroughly enjoyed all three.

Mottainai is not a light game.  But it is a quicker, somewhat streamlined version of Glory to Rome.  I feel that this is the better game of the two--and at an incredible value!  As for Uchronia however, I believe it still stands alone among these three, due to the separation of card types and the tweaks in game play, despite the obvious similarities.

But as for Mottainai, I will likely play it the most among them, due to the swift nature of the gameplay...in theory.  At least, that's what I want to happen.  The problem is the [very] steep learning curve.  The rules are mostly unintuitive.  With unique rules, and both strategic and highly tactical play, this is definitely a gamer's game.  It will not go over well among light gamers.  Don't even bother.  Even among heavy gamers, most will probably not like it unless they've committed to actually learning how to play it.  I did not like this game...at all after my first play, but insisted on a second round.  What a difference it made!  My opinion of this game has grown exponentially since then.

I think Mottainai is among the meatier time-filler style game I've ever played.  You can crank out a game in just 10-15 minutes with 2.  I could see it going as long as an hour with 4+.  But it really shouldn't.  Either way, there is plenty to do in a short amount of time.

Glory to Rome is one of my favourite games.  I love the multi-use cards, and I love the minimalist artwork, and I love the way every turn is a genuine decision: Do I build this or lead with it or use it as a resource?

Glory to Rome is also long out of print.  And so we have Uchronia, which is basically Glory to Rome with dinosaurs, and now Mottainai, which is basically Glory to Rome with monks -- I think?  And is maybe set in Japan?

In other words, the theme is pretty murky.  Unfortunately, so is the gameplay.

People say this is a good two-player game, and they may well be right.  I can't say for sure because I already sold my copy.

What I can say is that it's very disappointing at four and five.  Turns are glacier slow as each player does one action for every other player, then takes their own action.  This can be seen as a version of the lead/follow mechanic in Glory to Rome, but whilst that game has everybody potentially playing every turn, Mottainai has one player taking many actions in a row as everybody else sits around and hums to themselves.  Victories seem to come out of nowhere, and the game ends with a whimper rather than a bang.

Production-wise, this is better than a lot of Asmadi stuff, but the card layout is messy, the artwork is washed out, and the player boards are made of an unsettling cardboard that is somehow both textured and shiny.  The box is nice, though.

Sigh.

I'm willing to give this another shot to see if my opinion improves but I think this game is not properly balanced.  There are way too few cards going into the floor for the number of actions players have.  What's the point in having helpers to take actions multiple times if two of the five actions require cards on the floor and the only one there is the one that came out of your task pile that turn?  We kept checking the rules again to see if there was any other way cards would be added to it, but in our game only one work that was played allowed the floor to gain cards so our floor was nearly empty every time.  If not for that problem I would have liked this game much more.

I can't say this is "not so good" which constitutes a 4, but also can't say I'd play it if I were in the right mood (6).  The problem I have with Mottainai is the same problem I have with all of this designer's games... they are seemingly unnecessarily complex; it's as if he finds a way to incorporate certain mechanics whether it makes sense or not.

Definitely feels like a Chudyk - by that I mean walls of text, poor production quality, poor graphic design and UI, splaying of cards, convoluted terminology, long queues of actions on every turn, and non-intuitive mechanical systems.   That's not all bad, though.   I felt like Glory To Rome had a bit stronger thematic implementation, but this has its own unique flavor too.   I feel like there is probably a good game in here, but it needs somebody else to overhaul it to make it more presentable and clear.

Revised this up a step to a 7. I think it might work better with 2 than 3. This game fulfill a roll as a two player filler varient of Glory to Rome quite well and it does have a different feel to the bigger game. Not really sure its a substitute however.

Really just an initial impression after one game. There appear to be fewer real decisions in this game than Glory to Rome as most of the time you only have one or two cards to choose from that will actually further your position as such it feels bit like GTR in a straight jacket. However i suspect this game will open up once players understand the strategy. It's definitely less accessible than the other Chudyk titles I have played.

It's been a while since I've played this one. Also, I learned this one from someone else rather than reading the rules myself. This usually always makes a game more confusing and less fun for me. So, take my opinion with a grain of salt. This had a very Glory to Rome-esque feeling, but maybe that the cards weren't as swing as it's ancestor. I know that I didn't like that this game also had a card similar to one in Glory to Rome that instantly ends the game. Maybe I would like it if I played it more, but a tableau-building game has to be pretty fantastic for me to consider adding it to my collection. I feel like I have a lot of great games that already fill this niche.

Fast paced Glory to Rome.

There are some good things going on here: "Praying" provides you a bonus [i]and[/i] deprives your opponents of your actions.  Using others' actions speeds up the game immensely.  Building is much easier.

However, the short gameplay revealed some flaws in the randomness of the game.  I am not convinced these issues were not present in Glory to Rome, but they're obvious in Mottainai due to the game length and being able to play more.

My wife and I have played Glory to Rome a large number of times, and it is without a doubt one of favorites.  It was with excitement and some trepidation therefore that I ordered Mottainai and our impressions cannot help but be affected by our love for GtR.

So what are our initial comparative thoughts: Mottainai is clearly a tighter and more streamlined game, with many less cards to contend with. The gameplay is similar enough to actually make picking it up harder than if we didn't have so much experience with GtR.  Despite the "easier" build mechanics, it actually feels harder to do so. Or more card dependent perhaps? Because of the streamlining, Mottainai doesn't seem to have the same engine-building, epic feel to it that GtR does.  It seems more unbalanced, and it is especially difficult to counter the rapid build strategy when your opponents cards are clicking in their favor.

So I am reserving final judgement for after we have played some more, but so far, it doesn't hold up to GtR for us.

[b]Smooth, quiet, quick Chudyk game of using cards several different ways to build up actions and materials to get down point cards to win. Each cards has unique powers when built. Rated 8 because of how quick it plays.

December 2015. I finally learned Mottainai and played it 3 times in the last two days. The [b]first play[/b] was a bear, but still very interesting. It's hard not to compare this to other games by the same designer, and I saw a lot of Impulse in this game. It's not as "kablooey" as Innovation, but it does have unique powers on each card, like Innovation. I won my first game 26-12, and my third game 6-1!

I enjoy the stream lining of this game and making it more if a 2-3p game. I want to play this a bunch and explore it. Games that make you powerful and allow to an exploit an advantage are my kind of bag. Especially the ones with good catchup/alternative powerful plays or play fast.


UPDATE:
------------
Finally starting to get the hang of this game after a few plays. You really want to be developing your board and resources by completing the cheaper works and gather helpers/materials. Then you want to go for ending the game once you have a lead through sales or back orders or just from completing works

The main challenge in explaining the game is mainly the cover mechanic. I wish they would use a different word for that which is more thematic.

Wife got the hang of this game after a few turns in her first game and crushed me. I hope to play more vs her and BO3 vs others


UPDATE 2:
------------
Having played this game a lot now, I still really enjoy the lightness of it. While some cards are standing out as stronger than others, I'm still seeing new cards that get a spot light in certain games so there is a lot of variability here. The only thing I'd have to say is that the opportunities to build up an engine/combos is not that frequent in this game

BO3 is a great way to play this game

All I can say right now is that I'm not eager to dash my brains against this one anytime soon.

Carl's games really need to come with a tutorial walkthrough scenario for first-time players, explaining how the parts fit together strategically. It's ridiculous to expect anyone to see past the confusion of all the abstract, seemingly arbitrary rules on the first play, or ever without a real commitment.

As I write this, only the beta PnP is out, but I really enjoy Mottainai (and in fact have liked all the iterations of rules I've tried). Compared to the Chudyk game I know best, Impulse, it's shorter and more 2p-oriented, which makes it good for a much wider variety of occasions.

It feels like there's more luck, which is less satisfying, but, well, it's not like I have a surfeit of other thinky 2p games that only take half an hour even with slow players.

RATING: 8.5
Feels like Race for the Galaxy; tight, simple rules but absurd depth. Every game has felt different and I still don't think I fully "get" it yet. Very polished and well balanced, every game has had a new set of apparently viable lines of play. Nice middle ground between tactical turn-to-turn play based on your opponents tasks and longer strategy with your works and sales.

Rulebook is kinda annoying and the first three times we played it were wrong in one way or another. Really not okay given how relatively uncomplicated the rules actually are.

Too soon to tell, but after 1.5 plays it seems quite promising.  I am a huge GtR fan and thought this would be very much the same but watered down.  But it seems to have its own personality, and I can absolutely see an Innovation influence.  Looking forward to playing it more.  (Really hoping it's better at 2P than GtR is.)

Update after 6 games: I seem to like this better every time I play it.  Tentatively rated an 8.

Not sure how long it will stay a favorite, but loving it.  So far I think this will beat out the other chudyk games for me and last a while.  Quick setup and play, lots of strategies.

Weak theme has made it a niche game rather than a RFTG competitor.  Some friends like it, some don't.

LOVE this game. I jumped at the chance to back this on Kickstarter when it was announced as the spiritual successor to Glory to Rome, a game that blew me away after only playing it twice. It's NOT GtR, but I appreciate that it's designed to play very well as a 2 or 3 player game, plays faster, yet still captures the complexity and feel of GtR.

RATING: 7
Glory to Rome's kid sister is FAST playing and fun.  50-ish unique cards is just right for variety of play and familiarity within your first couple games.  

Plays pretty well with 2 but it's easy to hit dry spells with no cards of a certain type.  A 3rd player helps since you get an extra action each turn.

Since this game becomes a race for points rather than an engine builder I prefer it's meatier big brother.  Overall it's a nice little game and a great intro to the mechanics of GtR if nothing else.

I'm not entirely sure how to rate this game at this point in time -- as there are *at most* 10 different effects that your tableau will have within a game, the game (at this point) doesn't feel as chaotic as other Chudyk games, but rather a much more controlled implementation of a Glory to Rome'esque card flowchart.

Things I love:
- running the deck out is a real and present threat;
- the art work;
- this game can be played with 2 right out of the box;
- there's still the signature Chudyk interactive-chaotic element.

Things I'm less certain about:
- the game feels more mechanical/procedural than any of the other Chudyk games I've played.
- the signature Chudyk interactive-chaotic element is a bit less pronounced. The game is probably more streamlined, but less visionary, experimental, striving for new heights, etc. accordingly.

If you like clever games & don't care for themelessness this might be something for you. Especially if you like Glory to Rome.
If not, then steer away from this one.

The combos are pretty nifty you can pull off, but just give me even a tiny scrap of theme please..

Cards do pray, craft and whatnot.. Well now that i think of it, even though glory to rome has a tiny speck of a theme i don't enjoy it.. so forget what i said. It's just not my kinda game.

Mottainai is a careful reworking of Glory to Rome, utterly and appropraitely rethemed, with end conditions that keep it short and tidy.

All of this, plus Chudyk's ingenuity should make it more glorious than its predecessor, but somehow I can't rate it there, not yet.

Some of the wacky unbalanced seems to have left from GtR, and while shorter playtime is generally a good thing, some of the crazy comebacks are also seemingly cut short.

What is left seems far more of an engine building game, with fewer crazy combos- though that impression may change with additional plays- and often that can mean 1 good engine, and 1 less good engine.

The artwork, theme and play are still very strong- this is a solid alternative, if you can't afford a Black box GtR and strongly prefer the less cartoony artwork- but I'm not yet convinced this replaces GtR for me.

I've played this a dozen times now and I'm very impressed.  From an abstract perspective, until a card is "built" the deck comprises only five different cards, but the options for manipulating these cards are many.  When "built", each card is unique in its influence on the game, interacting directly or indirectly with the basic rules.  It is true that the first game or two will stutter along as you become familiar with the rules and weed out the odd ambiguity, but after that this is a deep, portable and short game par excellence.  Like a hip flask containing 35 a year old single malt whisky.

A Glory to Rome variant, but it just doesn't have the right sort of feel to it. Building the Coliseum or even a Roman Sewer is one thing, building a paper aeroplane just doesn't have the same vibe. It's also even more luck dependent than GtR, getting enough clay or metal cards with a hand limit of 5 is pretty unlikely. A good illustration of the inadvisability of tinkering with a modest, but successful design.

Craft-themed multi-player card-game in the style of Glory to Rome. I like this theme much better, but that's pretty subjective. Great at two, get the feeling it'll be even better at three/four. The game has lots of little recursive mechanics and interesting choices (though that does make it an absolute beast to teach).

Excellent production values over all. Well designed box, fits all components plus sleeves. The two decks have different back colors, so they're easy to tell apart after a larger game.

Decent 2-player game, if somewhat disbalanced. (so far whoever got the "automatically move task to sales" card always won)
Pretty much unplayable with 4 people - what used to be a 15-minute 2-player game turns into a 2-hour grind-fest (since every extra player doesn't just have his own actions, but adds actions to everyone else). Have not tried with 3. Do not even want to contemplate 5.

Totally not for me.

Glory to Rome (which this is evolved from) was never completely in my wheelhouse.  Allegedly, those mechanics were more finely balanced and incorporated into this game.  Just did not scratch any itch for me at all.  The mechanics are just too cumbersome for me to enjoy.

Also one of the rare games where the theme feels like value subtracted - producing cheap retail goods . . . really?  I could not understand how any of the effects / actions that the cards generated were thematic at all.  Say what you want about the goofy Glory to Rome artwork, but at least the cards had some thematic relevance to their actions.

July 2015:

I had to give this game a fairly high rating because it prompted us to play it 8 times in a few days.

However, in the long haul, I wasn't super impressed.  Once you are good, the games are over way too fast.  (I still need to try it playing to 6 works per side.)  And getting to "good enough" was 5+ plays.

I prefer this to Glory to Rome; it's much cleaner (no seeing new cards until the end of your turn) and just seems more cohesive.

This seems like it's going to be a lot of fun. My first play was 5p against the suggestions of the rulebook, and we had a couple of people going a bit slow so the game dragged. It also just in general seems like it would be better at 2-3. I can see a lot of games ending right as I'm getting ready for a big turn, and that will be really frustrating, but not necessarily in a bad way. A lot of the cards seem super powerful and getting your combos going seems like it should be a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Mottainai trades the smooth, elegant gameplay found in the finest Euro games for complex interactions and wild possibilities. This could work (it did in Innovation), but with Mottainai it is a giant misfire.

The main issue in Mottainai is that it is impossible to actually plan out a strategy. The game is extremely tactical due to the rapidly changing game state. One can do all the brainwork to find a powerful combo only to have it become completely useless by the time it is actually one's turn.

Combine this issue with cards that can be severely aggressive (as in making players lose multiple scoring cards or ending the game suddenly) and one gets a game that has tons of complexity but doesn't pay off due to excess chaos.

Things I didn't like:
The theme of factory manufacturing small items
The lack of meaning in the language used - e.g. why does a 'potter' action do what it does?
The dis-join between the theme and the game mechanics

Things I liked:
It was over in less than an hour.

It's a bit of shame because:
I enjoy the same designer's Innovation - but that game's theme draws me in and has some fun to overcome and make sense of its swingy mechanics.  This game is very dull and in the two worst games I have played in 2015.

First off I'm a die hard Glory To Rome fan so this one is just ok for me.  The GTR mechanics are getting a bit worn out in my opinion, and none of the "wannabe" games come close to replicating the original. If I'm going to play a GTR knock-off I will probably play Uchronia. Now if only someone would Kickstart a reprint of the GTR Black Box edition so I could get my own copy....

RATING: 3
Our group has played this 3 times, and opinions are deeply divided regarding this game. As for me, I simply cannot get around the theme - it is utterly mystifying to me. Okay, so I guess I'm supposed to be a Zen Buddhist monk, and ... oh look, I drew the smithing card. So that means I have the smithing skill, right? I should be able to blacksmith something. But whoa, I'm also supposed to ... I don't know, somehow run the cash register at the ... monastery GIFT SHOP? And for that I need the clerk skill, which (if I wanted to) I could also use to make paper products. And I'm trying to sell things? Or not? But the other monks also work the gift shop, except we're all engaged in some cutthroat and weirdly un-Zen-like internal battle to sabotage each others efforts to actually sell souvenirs to the tourists who show up at our mountain retreat? It would make more sense to me if the game were re-themed as "Passive-Aggressive Retail Clerk Hell;" set in a shopping mall kiosk staffed with angry rebellious teenagers who are actively engaged in trying to drive the business into bankruptcy.

Not as interesting as Innovation, my favorite of Carl's games, but still enjoyable. This game lacks the arc that Innovation has. Or I should say that the arc, whatever it turns out to be in a game, is not built in to the system. The system feels like it is asking you to exploit it.

The game can end very quick or it can be an extended slugfest. There is a lot within a player's control to dictate the pace and approach taken towards the game. Cards can get burned through VERY quickly. But that is a choice, not a necessity, for better and for worse. The key to the game is forcing it to end when you think you have the advantage. If you play it right, you can set it up so that after about 12-15 quick turns you can pretty much end the game at will...  It's kind of cool and kinda not cool in that way, and I want to play it more.

Plays great with 2 players. 

UPDATE: Man. Mostly, this game finishes before it gets started. I still enjoy the game, I just wish there was more of it. I don't need to keep this one.

The first play of Mottainai requires some determination to get through it. The game play is actually simple enough, but it is not intuitive and requires a fair amount of maintenance. I will usually give a game a rating after one play and I adjust as I play more, but in this case I am not rating the game until I have a better sense of it. Based on my long history of card games, I want to like this game and think I will, but I also have to hope that it smooths out after a few plays. Then I can get into the great depth that is obviously there.

Warning: this game has an incredibly steep learning curve. Before deciding whether you like it or not, play it through 3 times.

My wife and I followed this advice, cold from the rulebook, and after the 3rd game we figured it out and now we've played it well over 100 times. It is our favorite game to play together. It's a very deep, strategic game contained in only 54 cards; so it's quick to set up and take down.

Have heard that it's a streamlined but soulless GtR. Will soon find out for myself.

Edit: I don't think rulebooks or reviews do Chudyk games justice. Perhaps I'd like this less if I had played GtR. Till then, another game I really enjoy!

I'm sure Carl Chudyk is a genius. People love his games. They're sophisticated and well-built. Often, I just don't enjoy them. Like Vlaada Chvatil (whose games I can't stand because I hate playing against a brutal system of scarcity where turn order is ultra-important), there's something about Innovation and this that rub me the wrong way. GtR I can enjoy, but I dunno, I think Mr. Chudyk and I just don't share a wavelength when it comes to defining what's fun to spend time doing, and that's fine.

[PNP] I wish I could play this game more. It seems quite hard at first but when it clicks it is one of the most satisfying puzzles there is. Most of the cards are flatout op but that's okay because everyone has access to them. You need to find ways to gain advantage from other people's actions and try to not give them the same chance. The cards can be used as materials helpers or works and this creates a sweet puzzle you have to solve for every turn of the game. What do you do with those precious actions. On top of all these the games are really quick. I just love this game but I know it is not for everyone else.

Takes a while to get your head around the flow of cards and which sections you can ignore at which times, but once it clicks it's solid, and full of trademark Chudyk card texts - great metaphors which seem on the surface like overpowered throwaway ideas, but turn out to be a thoughtful challenge once you try them out.

I've played enough Glory to Rome, Innovation and now Mottainai to say that Carl Chudyk games just aren't my cup of tea. They are enjoyable at first, and even kind of addictive while you are learning the different combos and strategies. But something changes after a while, I think because the swing in the relative value of strategies is so great. Almost every game is decided by a "killer combo," and that just isn't satisfying for me. That's why this one had to go.

A card-based city building game, where each player is a monk trying to improve their temple and race for the most victory points.

Played once, 5p. What the hell happened? I feel as if a deck of very nice game cards was thrown into a blender, and the players had to put everything back together again.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Typical Chudyk game with strong, unique powers on cards where a person can run away with victory. This happened in my first game and it was ugly. Took a while for me to grok this game as I kept thinking Glory To Rome and while there are similarities, it is sufficiently different. Can end quickly. Not sure where I stand on this one - willing to play again.

Complex and involved, yet plays in 10-20 min. As a spiritual successor to Glory to Rome (GTR) this hits all the right buttons and does it in a clean package. An excellent small card game for two or three players looking for an interesting experience. Just don't play with 4 or 5 people, it becomes a bit too lucky...

Game which is very close to Glory to Rome, but that I like better (as a two player game): it is faster. Faster to set up (fewer cards), with nice colored graphics (compared to the Black Box edition), and faster to play (maybe it ends faster?). 

The card effects is quite remote from their title, but some connections can be made (even Innovation is better in this respect).

The effects are very varied and strong: I like the strongly flavorful situations that's it puts me in (but Magic with Planes is better in this department). 

I really like how the turns go very fast. 

Overall, this game has a place in my collection because it has crazy effects but is easier to set up than Glory to Rome. It has some mechanics that are quite unusual and excite my curiosity: I would love to feel more in control in this game. It is faster than Innovation while having cards with similar effects. To summarize: the game offers a nice challenge while being a game which is easy to bring out because it I should fast. 

The card effects are not fully obvious, but the official answers on BGG make me feel like I get how the game I should intended to be played, so no real complaint on this side.

After three games, I am stilll forgetting a few rule points (one in the last game), but the feeling of getting to feel the game flow better I see nice.

After six games, I am still discoveringtactical tricks . I prefer games that allow you to strategize early, or that don't feed you with discrete tricks but instead let you grow in layers where you learn smoothly and progressively by expanding your horizon and general understanding.

After playing 6 2-player games, I feel that often I feel helpless because of a strong combo from my opponent. Now, if I won as often as them I could complain, but it's not yet the case, so I want to explore the game more.

The card effects are quite "discrete": they are so strong that they create a relatively large variance in the game result. Now, I do lose more than I win (against T), even on a few games, so the variance is not that strong.

RATING: 8
Every game of Glory to Rome I've ever played was a learning (or re-learning) game for someone, usually me. I liked it okay but it always seemed to go on forever. I liked the idea of it (tableau-building with multi-use cards? yes, please!) but it always overwhelmed and underengaged. I later tried Uchronia, the next attempt to use this engine and found it similarly annoying. It's the game that prompted my theory that if you have a rule where you can trade in a number of cards of type A to get one of type B, then you have too many types. 

Still thinking there was a "there" there but not quite finding it, Mottainai was tempting, but I found the theme weird. I'm a Buddhist monk trying to make the most money?

This may be the one that finally works. It's still a monster to get your head around at first, but it clicks before too long. There are only five different main types of cards, so that business is kept in check. There are still some odd complexities to it and it could probably still do with some editing, but it actually still works okay. And it doesn't take forever to play.

I don't always completely roll with his stuff, but I believe Carl Chudyk is one of the most interesting designers to keep an eye on.

UPDATE: Enjoyed another game of this. It's a solid design, and in my opinion better than Glory to Rome, which has way too much going on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the hardest games to teach but once it clicks the game is excellent. There are a ton of different strategies for a relatively small deck of cards which makes each decision a struggle. Plays best at two and is still great at three but I strongly suggest you avoid anything else.

It seemed more swingy that Innovation based on the draws. I LOVED the boards and the way that each card could be used multiple ways, and the Task/Floor setup was pretty great. But I enjoyed it less than I expected after learning the rules because it just felt like so much of what you could do was dependent on the cards you happened to draw.

Solid game; tight and well-constructed.  Dense for length and footprint.  I haven't played any other of Carl Chudyk's games but I really like this one.  Plenty of tough decisions and satisfaction of accomplishment.  As a long-time Race for the Galaxy player, this hits new spots and possibilities.  I like the multi-turn planning and the tactics. 

A bit tough on newcomers since "knowing the cards" is a must.  Familiarity with each card is a must.

I feel like there's a lot of potential here for clever gameplay.  Addicting, too - ready to play again, but opponents don't feel that way. I'm not sure I can keep it in the rotation long enough for it to really 'stick' with players.  If I have to explain the difference between a Smith action and a Craft action again, I may scream :)  Don't get me started on what it means to be covered.  Sadly, this probably won't stay in my collection.  I'll stick with Glory to Rome and Race for the Galaxy.  It is good for people that can knock out a ton of games back to back to really understand the game.  Need at least one dedicated opponent.

Really liking it so far, after getting the hang of the flow. My wife took a little longer to get the flow, but is still giving it a chance. It's our first Chudyk, and has the potential to be very swingy, as most would say. But I'm going in early on with a desire to see what kinds of cool combos I can make with the cards, and if I win, so be it. I think that's a good way to learn his games.

And now I'm really tempted to KS the Deluxe Innovation.

probably my favorite filler game, has my favorite mechanism in it (using a card in one of many different ways)

Cards are unbalanced, but since the game is usually over in 20 minutes anyways, who cares.  On the other hand, sometimes I wish the game would go a little longer once you build your engine, so I need to someday acquire a copy of its big brother, Glory to Rome

Not nearly as engaging as Glory to Rome, but works well as a travel game.  With only 56 cards, it's much more portable and plays in less time.  You also don't have as much of a runaway leader issue.  That said, the combo building isn't as intricate or interesting.  The theme feels very pasted.

This game has some very smart mechanics and can be played with a single deck of cards which is cool. However the theme does not come through and I find the multi use cards quite busy and often unintuitive . I'd really like to play a multi use card game that has nice theme and simple but deep play, this is not really that game, but its close

Certain removal (but not a priority due to it taking no space)

UPDATE: Got the real thing and finally sat down and played it - and ye, it's still a **** to teach but I'm personally starting to get the hang of it a bit more so that ups it for me - so the old comment still stands, but this is a fun little game, lots to consider in terms of card combos and what pace to aim at (build up infrastructure vs rapid-fire crafting to end the game). I think I like it but I still need to play more with opponents who also got the patter down.



Waiting for the real thing, but I got an earlier version of the PnP to play meanwhile. 

A very intriguing card game, I can see it going up a lot with repeat plays. If anything, it's a biiiit tricky to teach. I can't say I've played anything like it so the "pattern" of play is hard to relate to. 

Ultimately, it will be a keeper or a goner based on wether I can get others to like it - myself, I've played enough MTG and other card games to like this, but if this doesn't get enough playtime to become natural in play then ye...

Rating based on 2 plays:  I like Glory to Rome very much, and was hoping for a good 2-player GtR experience.  This game shares many similar mechanics to its older sibling, but also many differences.  It was surprisingly confusing on the first play, I was not sure what to do or how to even keep my head above water.  Second play was much more enjoyable though, so I may need to warm up to this game.

[i]Mottainai[/i] has gotten better and better with each additional play. Streamlined and elegant yet rich in incident and complex cross currents. Background with [i]Glory to Rome[/i] helps some but only so far. Hardest parts are coming to grips with how works "cover" helpers and sales, crafting, and dealing with "backorders:" all good stuff once you're used to it. Beginning to wonder if exhausting the deck ever happens with just two playing. [17 plays, mostly two-player]

There is a lot of depth in this game.  However, I hard a really hard time keeping all of the possible actions in my head, and I couldn't really find a coherent strategy.  I think both of these issues would resolve with repeated plays, at which point I suspect its rating would rise.  Only time will tell.

RATING: 8
During the last few weeks I've rediscovered this game. It is a streamlined, elegant, and dynamic reiteration of Glory to Rome. It's a much better game for two players. From my experience it takes about twenty games before you begin to understand how the cards work, how the deck works, what combinations are possible, and the reciprocal balance between the players. As the game is so short, investing the time to play twenty games is really not a big deal. And it's worth it. Once you are sufficiently familiar with the deck, the game flows seamlessly and it's very interesting, quick, thoughtful, and a great deal if fun.

I really liked it! I like GtR more, but I've played it a lot more times.

There are some similarities but there are also great differences between the two and it's probably weird to say but this one is even more interactive than GtR!!!

Really liked how you can use the other players actions... that all cards are unique...

There's a lot of game there for just 52 or 54 cards!

Basically a quicker Glory to Rome, which plays great with 2 players. Don't know how bad downtime could be with more players as you don't do other players actions during their turn, you do it at the start of yours.

Finally Carl Chudyk has designed a game that is streamlined, elegant, and enjoyable to play. Mottainai is the latest incarnation of the system popularized by Glory to Rome, and I do believe that this is the best of all those incarnations. No longer are you having to decide if you want to follow someone's action, or have a cluttered area of cards to utilize. Instead you have a really clean design that cuts away all the chaff seen in his past designs into something that works extremely well. I only wish that there were more cards and that the theme made a little more sense with the mechanisms.

Replaces Uchronia for me, and keeps me from ever wanting to play Glory to Rome.

4p way too much downtime between turns, little luck prone if your cards mesh well with what previous people have and what your hand currently is, summary guide could have been clearer and didnt need so much terminology like floor and such. Shouldve included a summary for those terms in that case.

Coming from someone who has played GtR, Uchronia and Innovation, I still had a hard time with the rule set. It took me three games (doing a walk-through by myself) before the game started to reveal itself.

It's as if Carl decided to put a corset around GtR and hatched Mottainai. This is a very tight/constrained game. Don't expect the jungle gym of GtR. This game rewards you if you play tactically. If you try to play with any preconceived strategy you'll likely get frustrated.

This game will be hard to get to the table with casual gamers. However, for those who like a deep game that rewards you with multiple plays, I think this is a keeper.

I can see why Glory To Rome would want tweaking, updating and refining. And I can even see that Mottainai is a much-tested improvement on the original material. But the original material was never that exciting, I'm afraid.

Mottainai is potentially a great combo game, but it just spends too long being opaque and awkward. And there's no really good player count.

Wicked game. Quiet and serene this ain't. Much quicker than Glory to Rome. In the deck for 2-3 players, each card is unique. Therefore, I believe is ever the same, no game is ever the same.

Learning curve. I like the (digital) paper artwork and the graphic design.

Good 2 players.

My rating might change with time as I witness more of the potential combos come into play. That is, I hope to answer my question "will this game become more fascinating in a good way, or a bad way?".

RATING: 8
"Clever, tiny, quick, swingy, slightly brain-burny game. The thin theme is barely enough to keep me interested, although some of the terms make it harder to learn. I haven't played other similar games, so can't compare to those."

What I like:
- Tiny box, small footprint, and tiny price
- Quick, and mechanically simple, but deep, with lots of interesting decisions
- Every card is unique
- Card quality seems quite good

What I don't like:
- Difficult to teach; difficult to remember how to play
- Mini player mats are not easy to tuck cards under
- Almost 10% of the cards are attacks, although most aren't too hurtful
- The theme is barely there, and in some cases the terms are counter-intuitive

This game really rewards repeat plays, frequently enough that you don't forget how the darn thing works. Re-teaching it to people who knew how to play months ago can be difficult, because you're not sure how much detail to go into. If you're only going to play it once in a while, I'm not sure it's worth it. 

My first 3 games took 20, 5, and 20 minutes, respectively, so this can be a quick game. My next couple games took about 45 minutes. I was able to teach it in about 10-15 minutes, I think, although I knew my opponent wouldn't actually know how the game really worked with just that. 

The game is weird because you might build up a big engine and be able to use it, or it might end after just a few rounds due to the cup. The backorders can really add up, so you often don't really know how many points your opponent has. 

About 10% of the cards are some form of attack, but the most painful attacks tend to be pretty expensive and situational. The main interaction is in the leaching/denying of tasks. So far, it feels compatible with my conflict-averse "carebeagle" nature, but that could change over time. 

I would put the weight around 3.0.

Mottainai is a spiritual successor to Carl Chudyk's Glory to Rome. It is very much a Chudyk game, complete with multi-use cards the are tucked under various sides of your player mat, the ability to use actions played by opponents, and obscure jargon. That said, this is probably the smoothest-playing Chudyk game. It isn't too hard to grok once you get the hang of it, and the card text, while important, wasn't crazy swingy. I imagine Chudyk fans will love this; myself, I'd play it more but I'm not terribly excited about the prospect.

We went back and tried this again after letting it sit for a few years, because our initial impression was that playing it left a bad taste in our mouths but we weren't really sure why. 

We like Chudyk's other popular in-print game "Innovation" as a 2p despite how brutal it can be. Mottainai is similarly combative, but not in a fun way. In Innovation, you have wildly overpowered cards that can be employed for a few rounds while your opponent figures out a way to gain parity so they can also use your overpowered card, or outright steal it, or use some comically diabolical card to sweep your feet out from under you (like anatomy, which strips the resources from your engine so you're dead in the water)

But you know what you're getting into with Innovation. It's basically hand-to-hand combat in an absurd and overpowered way that is sort of reminiscent of the feeling that I used to get playing early versions of Dungeons and Dragons as a kid. By contrast, Mottainai is subtle and cerebral and balanced... but it also contains what we refer to as "Dick" cards, because they are attacks, but of the most petty crappy kind that place rules or restrictions on the other player and reduce their ability to freely play. Innovation attacks are like Conan the Barbarian, whereas Mottainai attacks are more like Conan the IRS Auditor.

So, in Innovation, we might use an attack card, while exclaiming: "Boo-Yah!" but in Mottainai, it's more like: "Well, I'm sorry, but the best card I have right now is one that denies you the ability to use half the action cards for the rest of the game."  It's hard to put into words why they're so different, but when I finally said: "It's like Mottainai is as brutal as Innovation, but in a passive aggressive way, which makes it not fun if you play to win and frustrating if you try to play it without being a dick." She said: "Yes - spot on - that's it exactly." 

Now - to be sure, the game is slick. It plays like butter and the limited deck and interesting way the cards are played, scored and supported by the things you build... it's a work of damned genius. If Carl were to re-do Mottainai to make it an over-the-top fistfight like Innovation, it would be among the best card games in existence. But as it is, it just leaves a bad taste. This is the longest review I've ever written because this is the most conflicted I've ever been about a game.

Similar in many respects to Carl Chudyk's Innovation, Mottainai brings many new and interesting elements to the table. In common are the mechanisms of tucking cards to provide recurring benefits and sharing in other players actions, but Mottainai provides new and interesting play possibilities that distinguish it as unique.

The game tells the story of monks toiling away in their workshops, competing with each other to increase the prestige of their monasteries. As the game progresses, players complete works of art in metal, clay, stone, cloth, and paper, sell and display their artworks, and hire helpers to aid them in their efforts. Each and every card in the game is unique with evocative, minimalist artwork and game shaking special abilities. 

The strategic use of the cards for their actions and their special abilities, paired with the fact that each player must share their actions with their opponents, makes for deeply challenging and complex gameplay.

Mottainai went straight to the top of my wishlist, due to Carl Chudyk's status as minor deity. A friend had already printed out the beta release so I got to try a couple of 2p games. And, well, I'm not quite sure what to make of it yet. It's definitely more like Glory to Rome than Innovation or Impulse, and GtR is my least favourite of the three. It feels like a streamlined GtR rules-wise, but it's possible too much of the lovable craziness got excised too. I'll be following its development.

I was hoping this would be the game that fired Glory to Rome and Uchronia, and while I think it is on par with those games, it didn't really fix any of the issues most prevalent in Glory to Rome. There are still mean atack cards, and there are still instant win cards, and there is still a funky learning curve for new players. This does play much faster than Chudyk's previous titles, so I can see it hitting the table more often. It's solid, but I wouldn't run out and buy "Glory to Rome 3" if you already own Glory to Rome 1 and 2.

I backed this on kickstarter, and I've played it a few times so far (2p, as I expect almost all of my games will be). It's still too early to really know how I feel about the game, but I'm definitely positive about it. There are many obvious comparisons to Glory to Rome, but despite many mechanics being more or less identical, it was already clear after 1 game that this is NOT just a re-implementation. There are plenty of meaningful rules differences, and the "ramp-up" is much less scary than in GtR - I'm sure repeated plays will reveal powerful combos, but I don't see any of the "brokenness" that makes GtR such fun. That's not to say that Mottainai is inferior (although it might be), it's just very different and a game I look forward to exploring more. It was only on the third play that I really began to feel it "click", and it will be many more plays before I really know how to play. I can't stress enough though how different it is from GtR, despite on the surface having mostly the same mechanics.

A game where the flaws are obvious - some works are very weak and assistants are underpowered, but I really like the design of using your opponent's tasks and building a stable of sales covered by works. Only played 2p and suspect it doesn't scale past 3 well since it's already hard to keep track of how assistants, tasks and your powers work together. The unique design lets me forgive a lot its weaknesses.

Even though finding and teaching partners is a chore, it scratches a lateral thinking itch that very few other games do.

 I feel like I should like this game. It checks a lot of the right boxes for me, but I just find the play experience to be dull. Too often things in this game begin to grind as cards in the center dry up or the ideal action just is not available. It can be too easy to feel like the wheels are spinning and things just are not going anywhere. This game feels like work devoid of the satisfaction of a job well done. It is not exciting and for me is not terribly engaging. The Blah card art and spartan graphic design do not help matters. I can tell that this game will have its fans, but I am certainly not one of them.

2er, faster version of Glory to Rome, in case Innovation doesn't cut it for you. The engine is built much faster since cards are paid for by revealing the materials instead of playing + discarding them, making the pace much quicker and more unforgiving, which is a plus for me at this point. The action system is a bit of a twist, and doesn't require you to 'Follow' your opponent's lead, instead letting you leech naturally, which also seems to be good for interaction.

This has become the filler of choice when I have 30mins and playing with someone who already knows the game. Games are just 15-30mins long so I can get one game in, sometimes even two. It does have a steep learning curve though, it is not a light game. It took almost 5-8 games before we had any idea what was going on, but now we can zip through games in no time. Perfect when you want something meaty but have just half an hour on hand. Rewards repeated plays.

I'm just not sure about Mottainai.

On the one hand: I really enjoy it. It's a tight, quick playing version of Glory to Rome, which would probably be a top10 game if I ever made that list. I don't think it will ever replace GtR, but I could see specific instances where it could be a better situational fit. 

On the other hand: It is a colossal pain in the ass to teach. The rules all make perfect sense after you've learned them, but there are so many interconnected and intertwining concepts that it makes it difficult to explain certain key processes (such as which side to build on, and what the benefits of each would be)

As an example, and maybe because I wanted Mottainai to be GtR, in my first four games, we were playing all the turns simultaneously. Everyone played a face down role, revealed at the same time, and then proceeded around the table doing each other's actions in order. From a GtR perspective, this made perfect sense. But, as we eventually had to remind ourselves, it's not GtR. 

I guess the jury is still out. Sadly, the infrequency of repeated game plays in our group makes these more complicated games less attractive than if they could be played more consistently. I could see this as a game one would be able to enjoy with a significant other on a whim, but that situation does not apply to me.

Mottainai is similar to Glory to Rome, streamlined in some ways, more obtuse in others.  For me the theme actually makes the game more difficult to learn, though I'll grant that the art is more attractive.  

The game is more subdued than others from Chudyk.  It's more orderly.  It flows.  It might work better than GtR as a 2p game, but I don't think it'd be as much fun with more than that.

I've played Glory to Rome. In fact I used to own the "Black Box" edition. I believe that game to be way overhyped at this point due to its general unavailability. It's a fine game, but it's hardly the grail game people claim it is.

Mottainai scratches the same itch for me that GtR did, and it's mostly free of hype. There are people who claim GtR is far superior. I think the two games are very closeâclose enough. Both feature similar quirky combos and clever play. I personally enjoy the more original Buddhist gift shop theme of Mottainai more.

My only 10, so far. This is neither my all-time favorite, nor a game I think everyone will enjoy, but I consider it a perfect execution of a concept/system of mechanics.  With  only 54 cards, there is an amazing amount of depth, and a great balance of strategy vs. tactics.  I'm totally "floored."

Like most Chudyk games, Mottainai is card game that invites you to build a resource engine out of very random components. Unlike other Chudyk games, there's actually a sense of restraint and reliability in the game design that keeps the game less swingy and random. What remains is a pretty good card euro - probably Chudyk's best.

Carl Chudyk as a designer is always a plus. Glory to Rome was fun when it came out, but has been hard to get to the table. Innovation, on the other hand is become our staple game when time is short.

Now this game comes out, very similar to GtR, but more streamlined and seemingly triggering the same itch as Innovation does. Me want.

More slightly confusing card combos from Chudyk. I won and I'm not really sure how, but I managed to score 11 points on one turn which helped immensely.

I am starting to really dislike how I'm constantly having to internalise rules for Chudyk games and yet all I'm doing is working out what I am able to do, rather than what I want to do. Potentially interesting, but not for me. And also seemingly (on a first passing glance) not very dissimilar to GtR and Uchronia.

I also have a semi-irrational dislike of the Zen theme, but that's largely irrelevant here as the theme is not exactly strong in Mottainai.

Hey! A playtested and balanced version of Glory to Rome that's still available to buy for $20. How about that? 

The economy of design using just 54 cards is incredible. Covering and backorders add rich strategic choices to a very tight game. While Glory to Rome can really drag and outstay its welcome, Mottainai plays in 15-20 minutes, and yet feels rich and dense.

This game has chiseled away all the fat from GtR and it's just a better game all around.

It would be my go-to 2p filler if it weren't such a pain

3/4/2017: I have played this game several times and just started to write reviews on BGG. I enjoy the complexity of multiple uses of cards staple to Chudyk's design of Glory to Rome. I like the fact that this game can be played within 15-30 minutes, and because of that, you may not get the sense of climax that can be found from other games. After you start completing multiple works and start enjoying the different combos, the game ended just like that. In addition to that, the theme of the game does not integrate well with the mechanic. I wish the expansion currently under work will open up the game more and make the play more enjoyable.

RATING: 6
Mixed feelings after just a couple of games. An early game with the PNP seemed a little too restrictive and not fun, but a more recent game with the final product was much better.

The restrictive nature of the game, when compared to Glory to Rome, actually seems like an improvement. In GtR you could get a really good card early and basically win the game by spamming that card the whole time. That was part of the fun, but it could also make for a poor experience if you got stuck with junk while an opponent got a lucky marble. In Mottainai, even if you get a good card early, it seems like you still need to work to get the most benefit from it.

There are a couple of odd design choices, though. I'm not sure why you would ever put a completed work into the wing that covers your helpers. Helpers don't seem as useful here as they were in GtR, and it seems far more beneficial to put your works into the gallery to make sure you get points for your sales. Points aren't too easy to come by and you've got a limited amount of time (games end pretty quickly), so putting all of your completed works into the gallery just seems like too obvious of a move except under some specific circumstance.

Overall, though, I think I like it more than GtR. I really like the way a few elements were streamlined in Mottainai like getting points for "backorders" at the end of the game. In GtR there could be a small rich-get-richer issue if somebody scored a lot of marble and then also got bonus points for having the most marble, but in Mottainai you even have to work to benefit from having the most of a certain material type. You can score the most metal sales, but you only get the bonus points if you also have some metal in your hand at the end of the game. This makes for some interesting decisions near the end of the game.

Waiting to get more plays before rating, but has the potential to be really good.

Update: I like it and I'll play it when suggested, but I got rid of it for a couple of reasons. One, it seems best with 2-3 players and I usually play with more. Two, it can be pretty tough for some people to understand so teaching it can be rough. Three, it can feel a little too confining sometimes. You really need to build a certain card but you just don't have the right cards/actions available to be able to do so. I know this is intentional, but I prefer games that let me do the things I want to do.

Final judgment is that it's good, just not a keeper for me.

Sold.

(Dec 2015) Wow! Definitely at or near the top of my "best bang for your buck" games! For $15 MSRP, you get a really great, deep, flexible game in about 30 minutes. Plus the mini version is super portable. The only thing that keeps this from a 10 for me is that the rules are a touch tough to learn and teach. But once grasped, they're not too bad, and the game is so great that it doesn't bring it down too much.

RATING: 8
Really enjoy this game with 2 and 3 players. Bought the Mini version because, holy crap why would you want to play this with 5? WTF. But, solid rules, a ton of depth. The FAQ at the back actually answered my questions!

Played the PnP 3 times, then bought my copy and played a few more times. The main knocks: Terrible ordering of abilities on the player board, (Sure, the 1, 2, 3 makes logical sense, but the actions associated with each number are wildly jumbled because of this. Makes teaching it a bear for no reason. Plus, Prayer & Craft are missing.) turns that are just "draw a card," and the first few games are going to be ROUGH (really rough. Expect 45 minutes to 1 hour with 2 players).

For those with the patience to stick it out through the first few "head exploding" plays while trying to suss out certain rules and actions and mechanics, this game is very good. Kills Impulse for me. It's sufficiently different and more complex than GtR which gives it a good home on my shelf for a long time.

Out of an hour long first game, I spent 20 minutes trying to get my head around what the rules are and how you play it (unsuccessfully, mind you), 15 minutes looking back and forth between the card and player aid trying to understand what the cards actually did, and about 10 minutes playing.

Mottainai is a remake of Glory to Rome with a new theme and some slightly different rules. Thematically I think you're a Buddhist monk running a gift shop/museum? It's a bit fuzzy, we didn't really go into it that much.

On your turn, you first put the card from the top of your player board into a public pool of cards (the floor). Then you decide if you'll play a card to the top of your player board again or not. Then you go around the table and choose to do something with the cards other players have put at the top of their player boards or not. You can either do the action associated with those cards, craft that type of thing yourself, or pray (get a card for next turn). After you resolve other player's cards you get to do the thing your card does, or craft that type of item. If you chose not to play a card to the top of your player board, then you just pray after you've resolved everyone else's cards.

The cards are multipurpose. They function as a resource type to build things, a thing you can build, a type of thing you can craft, or a thing you've sold. When played as actions they allow you to do various things.

1) Pull cards from the floor to function as helpers. Helpers are placed on the left side of your player board and augment any actions you take of the matching type.

2) Pull cards from the floor to function as craft resources. Craft resources are placed at the bottom of your player board (your craft bench). When you craft an item you must have resources of the appropriate type present at the bottom of your board. How many depends on the type of thing you are crafting.

3) Change resources in the craft bench into sales (the right side of your player board). Sales are potentially worth points.

4) Craft something. The thing you craft must come from your hand and you pay for it by having cards in your craft bench (which are not consumed).

5) Build something. The thing you build must come from your hand and you pay for it by having cards in your hand (which are not consumed).

When you craft/build something it either gets built to the left of your player board (the gallery) or to the right (the giftshop). Cards in the gallery work with helpers you have of the matching type and essentially double-augment actions you take of that type. Cards in the gift shop make matching sales worth points.

The game ends when you a) run out of cards b) have any player build 5 items on one side of their player board or c) have any player build an autowin card.

I liked Mottainai a lot. The artwork is much better than either of the styles of Glory to Rome (the goofy comical one and the austere black box version). Additionally, several things in GtR were streamlined or simplified in Mottainai. Overall it was a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
[thing=175199][/thing] is, in thesis, a faster and somewhat simplified reimplementation of [thing=19857][/thing]. But, in practice, I found out that only one of these statements holds true. The rules are nearly as complex as those in [thing=19857][/thing], maybe even more difficult to explain and understand, as some parts were expanded (the buildings, now, can go in two different places - the Gallery and the Gift Shop) and others require much more attention, specially regarding timming, as in GtR is pretty clear the order of things, while in [thing=175199][/thing] there can be, sometimes, problems, at least early on, with the different phases (morning, afternoon and night), separating cards in hands and in the waiting area, and the order to activate the tasks of others, your own and the helpers.

To build, on the other hand, got easier: now is only necessary to have in hand the material required to build, or having them in the craft bench (ie: stockpile) - they aren't expend when used (think like material used to build in [thing=68448][/thing]).

There were some minor changes in the helpers (clients) as there isn't a limit for them anymore - they still boost actions. Sales (ie: vault) still can give lots of points, but they need to be "covered" by buildings of the same type (material) of the sale - one building can cover from 1 to 3 sales, depending on the type (I understand this part easily by making sense of it this way: the sales are, actually, (pre)orders, guaranteed by trust, however, in the end of the game, some won't be delivered in the deadline promised - so no points for them).

There was also changes in the "follow" action: now, instead of using a card in hand to follow the action taken by someone else, the player can use all the actions put in the task space - and the player, do make her own action, also put a card in the task. If there is already on card there, it is put in the "floor" (middle of the table) at the start of the player turn, then the player can put another there to do. The actions remain mostly the same:

- Clerk = Merchant
- Monk = Patron
- Tailor = there isn't an equivalent to it in the actions done by cards (it is basically the "Think" action). The player can discards as many cards as she want and then draw enough cards to fill a 5 card hand - the cards drawn stay in the waiting area, and the player only take them at the end of the turn
- Potter - Laborer
- Smith - Craftsman

You might notice the absence of the Legionnaire action - yes, [thing=175199][/thing] is a friendlier game, it isn't because a, say, Bishop action would be out of place.

In case that the player don't want to or can't play an action card, she can "Pray", which is buy one card from the draw deck and put it in the waiting area. Furthermore, if the player doesn't want to do an action made by someone else or the one chosen by herself, she can convert it into an Craft action (which is similar to the Engineer), but must build something of the material represented by the action card, and to complete it, the player can only use the materials she has in the craft bench (stockpile) - still, like in the Smith, the material isn't spend, it is only required to have them in the proper amount.

The game goes until the draw deck is depleted (unlikely) or until one player builds the 5th building in one of the two areas (gift shop or gallery). Points are awarded but buildings, sales covered and, in case the player has more sales of a given material than anyone else, by cards of the same type of material she has in hands. Whoever has the most points will be the winner!

Those that know my taste in games probably are aware that [thing=19857][/thing] is one of my favorite games, so I was pretty excited to play [thing=175199][/thing], one that could be the evolution of GtR. But it isn't. As first play goes, is an degeneration. Not because it is shorter and less prone to combos (the buildings are much more bland, beinding the game, and not breaking its legs and kicking it in the face, like some do in GtR), but much more because that the play was lacking in fun. It could be because of bad luck: in my first hands (plural, as I used the Tailor to trade it 3 times), I haven't found a Smith. I could still be able to build, if only the other player was using actions I could turn into craft, but he was mostly using my own actions to craft and doing his to Pray. This didn't stopped me from playing, I was indeed able to get helpers, take material into the craft bench and doing sales. But this isn't as fun, to me, as building and trying to change the dynamics of the game itself, escaping from the shackles of the basic actions. The heart of the game is build, acquiring differentiated actions, unique advantages to explore, and uncover interesting synergies. The basic actions are just a mean to get there, and when they became the very end, isn't as fun.

Is very likely that, knowing better the game, I could be able to do more, to escape de vicious cycle I entered, to have used better my early actions/options. This makes harder for me, in a first moment, to judge the game as a whole - and this isn't something usual for me, as my initial impressions for most games, even when incorrect, tend to be pretty solid. But with [thing=175199][/thing], no. It can be because I lack objectivity, due to my crush on [thing=19857][/thing] and in the hopes of bonding with its younger brother, as this would allow for me to get a taste of GtR, only faster and, probably, playing much more (GtR is daunting to some folk). Regardless of the reason, the result is that I can't reach a conclusion - I need to explore more, try some different paths, already knowing some of the way and the features (cards) of the land. One thing is for sure, though: the play was boring, dull, even if it was, indeed, fast - when I saw it, it was already gone.

****

After three more plays the game, [thing=175199][/thing] is opening its possibilities to me. These plays were a lot better - with several works in the game, there were some nice moments and neat combos. In one game, the Tablet was made, and it allowed for the floor to be flooded with materials, around a third of the deck was draw until we found one Metal card. This allowed for a different experience, as everyone could use Monk and Potter for full effect, even with several Helpers boosting the actions. Then a lot of Sales were made and this made for a tense end game, as there were a good dispute for the biggest amount of sales.

The other two games were more "normal", with materials mostly in tight order. In one, a 3 player game, one of them was going for the "negate" strategy, making works that made more difficult for us to use his tasks. Still, with three, it was easier to not depend too much on his tasks, so the flow of the game was still there, but the game did took longer than expected. The fourth play was the most tight, as two players did the Doll, so material and actions from the other players tasks were a much more rare sight.

These new plays allowed me to see one positive side of the game and a negative:

Positive: [thing=175199][/thing] allows for a good amount of strategy, since you can see what actions the others did (and you will do in your turn) and think in the best way of using them. And is nice to be able to prepare your next round also, as, normally, the very task you choose will be in the floor the your next turn, available for you to use with a Monk or Potter action. This is very nice.

Negative: since you don't actually do something in the game during the other players turn, the downtime is an issue, specially for those used to GtR, as in this you be either drawing cards or doing actions in the other players turns. Having played with 2, 3 and 4, the sweet spot, so far, for duration, constancy of play and being have better options, is 3 players.

RATING: 6
This is a card game where all the cards have special powers, like Innovation, though with about half the deck size. I thought that might make it more enjoyable for me as it would be more feasible to learn the cards. As it turns out, I'm disappointed with this. Mechanically, special powers aside, it's convoluted, abstract, and uninteresting. (I am comparing to Innovation here.) Each player has potentially seven hands/displays of cards (gallery, gift shop, helpers, sales, craft bench, hand, waiting area) named almost at random. The primary dynamic achieved is the age old dilemma between spending resources to gain more actions and spending them to score points.

This is a game where cards can be used for multiple things (e.g. you might use a card for its action but then be unable to use it as a material for building), and I'm wondering if/why I just like this less than a system where cards do multiple things simultaneously and I don't have to choose. Maybe I'd rather not have to think through the logistics (if I do this, will I still be able to do the other, etc.). Or maybe I feel like there isn't enough reward for solving the puzzle.

The cards are physically poor. There is an unevenly printed design on them with the effect that literally every card is marked if you care to memorize the backs. Furthermore you can tell which of the five colors a card is from the side.

After learning it and playing one game... this was, like, a 4. After a 2nd game, it's a 6. It MAY increase with more plays. (Edit: I increased to 7 after a few more... I don't think it'll go higher)

It's a VERY obtuse game but the interactions are interesting once you figure out how to accomplish what you want to accomplish. 

I acknowledge the strategy is good, and I enjoyed it more and more over time, but this game will never be a "top game" for me since the theme is just so far from the game. It's in another galaxy peering in on the mechanics with a telescope. It's essentially an abstract card game with a few minor threads tying random concepts together with theme but the overall theme is possibly the least tangible I've seen in a non explicitly abstract game. 

I do quite like that the deluxe version comes with 2 decks, we were able to play a 2 and 3 player game at the same time in my group with one game set instead of the 5 player, which would slow and alter the game significantly.

A wonderfully deep, if non-intuitive game. The learning curve is steep but absolutely worth the effort. Every card being unique gives the game a tremendous amount of replayability. It may be a largely tactical game, but you have such a wide breadth of options at any given moment that you'll never feel railroaded. Better the more you play it with the same people, and best with two which makes it a bit niche, but it's one of the best two player card games I've ever played.

I wish the theme made more sense, as I find the whole thing unintuitive and clunky. Not that much moreso than Glory to Rome, but that was more vibrant and "fun".

Preliminary rating -

Not sure if it is significantly different enough from Glory to Rome to hang on to.

After further plays, I like it more.  

I think this is the game for 2-3 and Glory to Rome is better for more.

Iâm a big fan of Carl Chudykâs Glory to Rome. I enjoy how the cards do different things and that the whole game is just one big attempt at finding that perfect combo. When I saw that Chudyk was coming out with a new game on Kickstarter that was supposed to be the spiritual successor to Glory to Rome, I jumped on it very quickly.

Mottainai is structured pretty similarly to Glory to Rome: you have multiple use cards, you pick tasks and (sorta) follow your opponentsâ tasks, you build things using resources, you can score points by moving resources into your sales (vault), you can get bonus actions by having assistants (clientele). However, you donât ever spend cards to build things, you just show them from your hand (when using the Smith) or from your craft bench. The game is over once someone has completed five works and those works are built on either side of your player mat and either function as training for your assistants (doubling the number of actions they provide) or they cover your sales (which means you actually get points for your sales).

First, letâs talk about the good. It feels pretty similar to Glory to Rome, which I consider a strength. It feels like itâd play quicker once you knew it well enough. I love the art. Itâs available for less than $100. You donât have to spend resources to build works. Itâs a lot clearer as to whatâs going on: you donât have to play a card to follow, you just take your opponentâs task on your turn before your task. In addition, it feels like the folks at Asmadi took a look at more complicated games that have sequences and sub-sequences and discretely listed the steps of your actions so thereâs never any confusion as to what happens when (huge kudos here).

However, it never quite feels like you can get enough cards, and I suspect thatâs intentional. It always feels like youâre just a few cards away from doing something awesome, instead you just have to wait a bit longer (and so does your opponent). Those awesome combos you would get in Glory to Rome are long gone (good luck building two things in one turn!). The training assistants and covering sales is a very clunky mechanic and was the hardest part to explain to my wife, a veteran Glory to Rome player. Last, Mottainai is just not different enough from Glory to Rome to warrant owning both.

If you already have Glory to Rome, Iâd skip this one. If you donât have Glory to Rome and canât get a copy at a reasonable price, Iâd look into Mottainai. However, as soon as they reprint Glory to Rome, toss Mottainai onto the trade pile.

A tableau builder card game themed as monks creating and selling wares to tourists. Multi-use cards played as resources (7 wonders style), or used to create items made from cloth, paper, clay, and such that give special abilities, or hired has helpers to bolster crafting or selling actions. Pray action needs to be timed for best value to refill your hand. Unique strategy decisions arise from turn phase options to copy other player actions or have your actions copied by others. Draft cards from the central discard pile. This is my favorite of the Glory to Rome re-imps despite the lamish theme.

I expect my thoughts on this game will continue to go up and up in the happy department with more plays.

Three sets of things to understand: 1. basic turn flow, 2. how to use cards to build engine, 3. how to use cards to gain points/more actions.  Challenging.

As much as I love GTR, I may like this flow implementation a shade more but I've not even dared try it with GTR (probably wouldn't work anyways due to sites cards in GTR), but as it is, GTR is one of my king-level games in how ridiculous and fun it is.

Mottainai is a lot of fun, once you've actually figured out how to play.  Like other Chudyk games, I had a lot of trouble with the rule book for this one.  It really is easier to just watch a video first and supplement with the book.  Once you get going, it's very good. Several of the cards seem totally overpowered, which means that none of them truly are. My only complaint is with the card tucking/splaying -- I wish the player mats were a tad bigger so everything fit under them a little more neatly. I guess they are the size they are to keep the Innovation-sized box.

Great game.  Explaining the rules can be a bit difficult, but once everything's understood this game packs quite a punch in a short timeframe.  I bought this instead of Glory to Rome because of the price differences so I can't comment on that comparison, but this is a great game, especially at 2!

Mottainai is fantastic! It's both more involved than Glory to Rome in certain ways, but quicker, and simpler in other ways. Mottainai is also great with two players. I look forward to playing the heck out of this game!

This game looks simple and cute, but it is actually quite deep and demanding (at least for my brain!). A lot of possibilities, a lot of things to choose between and many ways to acquire victory points. I like it, although it is not a very light game and requires some concentration to be played.

Compact game with lots of interesting choices. Difficult to teach new players so it's not going to see as much play. Played 15 times so far and still trying to figure out effective strategies. 

Compared to Glory to Rome: It's easier to build things (good) and is a quicker game so when you are behind the game doesn't drag on.

This seems to be about as much of an improvement over [thing=128063][/thing] as [thing=128063][/thing] was over [thing=19857][/thing]. At the end of the day, each has about the same merit, just in different ways. This one is probably the least mind-bending to get people playing the first time, and it feels like most of the lateral thinking pleasure is still here.

OMG. I really hate this game! I didn't understand any of it.  It is unnecessarily complex and not fun at all. Most games, I'll get the gist of the game after the first or second turn, but this game just did not make any sense the whole time.  I have never been so happy for a game to end. I don't know why other people give it such great reviews. There are a millions games better than this.

OMG SO CONFUSING. I don't think I've ever successfully made it through this game or figured it out. 

It's based on some Japanese concept about kind of minimalism? Like, only using what you need and nothing else but also wasting nothing?

Perhaps I just don't understand how this is meant to be played, but in my group, only the turtle strategy ever wins. Also, I don't have the feeling I have much influence over the game. I prefer Innovation where I know from the start it's a game of luck, but it's more fun.

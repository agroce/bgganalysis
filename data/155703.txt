This game is thematically well designed to be able to demonstrate natural selection through a short game play. The randomness in drawing cards represent mutation in DNA. And the scarcity of the food and how there are so many traits to be combined into different unique species types and ecosystem.

For those who gave this game a low score after one play and accusing hat a big carnivore is he ultimate solution totally stopped thinking straetgically to find ways to counter it. This gave is totally amazing and with great educational value.

5 plays / 4,5,6 players (1st edition & 2nd edition)

LIKE: Hard decisions to use which cards where. Cool theme, somewhat quick game. The card mutations are a great mechanism.

DISLIKE: The game is based heavily on luck of the draw, and a couple card combos seem very powerful. The late game is terrible: leaders will snowball and those lagging behind get trounced. Carnivores are more difficult than herbivores to maintain. Herbivores can easily circumvent them. 

OVERALL: Early game is fun, but fall behind and there's little chance for catching up. In one game, my carnivore ate the weakest player, but couldn't catch the strongest player. It's the late game that drags. Downrated after several plays.

I like the theme of this one as it spins up interesting critters jumping and thumping on each other in a frenzy to feed. I liked it so much that I got in on their latest incarnation on Kickstarter - hoping for a bit of extra excitement from Climate. But for me, this one is really solid fun.

The best part of this game is that it plays quite fast and has exactly the right length. BUT, we achieved this only when we chose to perform our actions simultaneously. I reckon that with too serious and tight players the game will be too slow for what it is.

I liked the evolution part and how you are trying to figure out the best way to play your hand. However, I did not find myself in too many tight situations in the game and all plays were quite obvious in the end. 

I disliked the fact that the amount of information on the table increases very rapidly and is scattered all over in form of text that is printed with unreadably tiny font. It will be ok once you learn all the cards by their looks but at the first few plays it will be very frustrating.

Evolution is a gorgeous game about evolving your dinosaurs, breeding new dinosaurs, and trying to make sure they all stay alive and fed in order to out compete other species. While the components are nice and the mechanics relatively intuitive, I found I and my group did not like the game that much. It felt a little too simple and like there wasn't enough going on in the game in terms of cards and options. the designer has kickstarted another edition with a flight expansion so maybe the game is better now but I am probably not going to buy a second copy to find out.

It's good - but Climate takes it to the next level. The groupthink in Evolution is too hard to predict at higher player counts, and Climate puts some of that on the board so you have a better chance of guessing who'd want what (i.e. who'd want it to go colder, who'd want to warm it up).

1st play: An interesting game, that is easy to introduce to non-gamers. There is some strategy to picking the right species and trying to make them thrive. I found myself wanting to make a carnivore all game and didn't really draw the card to do it. Most of the traits, it doesn't matter as much if you can't draw, but carnivore is such an important trait that I would like it better if I could freely choose carnivore or herbivore. The art is great and the theme makes sense though.

2nd play: I had no trouble getting Carnivore cards this time, and the game was more interesting for it. Overcoming other species' defenses can be a challenge, making carnivore a hard but rewarding creature type to play. There's more strategy than I initially gave it credit for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very good and very thematic game with a good playtime. Evolution unites a very clever mechanism that you feel like your species are getting evolved and there is a lot of interaction between players. The problem is that if not all the players pay attention at who is winning, this game can be frustrating. There is also the effect of: who the players think is winning, and push to hard to beat their species that this player is losing hard. Anyway, a very clear bash the leader system.

What an absolute delight of a game! Very, very beautiful art! Due to the ever changing variety of species which you'll create in each game, it seems there is no end of replayability. A tactical game, primarily; but it is the queen of tactical games! One must know when is the time to change course and go the way of the carnivore or something, or risk going the way of the dodo.

Cut-throat? Well, I suppose...sorta: I'm not a fan of cutthroat games, but Evolution doesn't bother me at all. Being eaten by a carnivore doesn't really make you curse the opponent's beast, but rather ask yourself, "Now why did I waste my time opting for Foraging when I could easily have had a bright, shiny new defensive shell?" You roll with the punches and it doesn't really seem all that cutthroat...to me, anyways.

A funny thing about Evolution is that it doesn't feel all that...evolution-y! It's more of a game about creating and taking part in a food chain rather than anything dealing with the theory of evolution. Once in a blue moon, you might change a trait; but that sure doesn't feel like your creature's evolved! It feels like your creature has adapted: adapted in an admittedly dramatic way. You are not developing from amoeba to dinosaur to mammal or anything like that: the vast majority of the trait cards show creatures that are fairly contemporary with each other. I don't know if this was the designer's deliberate intention, but for a game with the title "Evolution", it really seems like this could be played with good and friendly humour at your next mixed gathering of evolutionists and creationists! Apart from the title, there's no controversy in this game at all.

RATING: 7.8
A nice and easy to play card based game that captures the theme of evolution very well indeed.

Players take turns to evolve their already existing species with new traits such as long neck or horned, or they can make a whole new species to evolve in future turns. After all players have had a turn evolving or creating their creatures, everybody then feeds the animals from a limited pool of food.

How you evolve your creatures will dictate whether they thrive and continue to grow or die out and become extinct.

There is a good variety of strategies that one can employ  to make their creatures thrive yet the simplicity of the game mechanics can trick you into underestimating the strategy levels involved in a good game.

A great game that is a lot more thinky than it appears. Building up your species is cool, and I can't help but imagine what I have created as I see how they interact with the other species. I actually have found myself getting attached to them too, when they start getting predated into extinction. My only issue with it is variety, and it can get a little busy when every player has >2 species.

I really had high hopes for this game considering the theme and the designer, but I have to say that after one play, I was not particularly impressed with the actual gaming experience here.  The mechanics seem to boil down to creating card combos and utilizing card effects, all in an effort to feed more creature at a feeding hole.  Feed more creatures at a feeding hole - the game.  Hmmm.  I must have missed something.

Great game with many interesting choices and no set dominant strategy. You decide how to evolve your species in order to either get food more efficiently or for protection. Those who can adapt to the changing food and carnivore environment are best suited for victory. There are many interesting combinations that can work together to create a powerful species. 

It took me several plays to appreciate how well balanced this game is. At first certain strategies seemed dominant, then after more plays other strategies seemed dominant. As I understood the game better I realized that nearly every combination has a good counter play against it, you just need to "evolve" your strategy during the game. Discovering the various combinations and counter combinations is an "Evolutionary" process in and of itself.

The production copy has great components and slightly modified traits to make the game even better than the playtest version I had played before.

Two players made the mistake of choosing carnivore trait in first round and never recovered after they consumed/killed each other through necessity.  Game then seemed to suffer as no one else chose predators, but the consequential growth of population and lack of food necessitated a change of strategy.  Nice story arc.  Lots of good ideas and decision making.  But prone to AP.  Enjoyed much more than I'd anticipated.  A keeper.

Evolution is a card game simulating the struggle among different species of animals to survive and evolve, competing for food.
The mechanics are very simple and straightforward: in turn, each player plays cards as traits to evolve existing species, or discards cards to raise species' size or population, or create new species.
The flavor emerges both from the interaction among players, and from the different traits cards.
The production value is quite good, with a big prop for the amazing artwork.
The game is enticing, and I am eager to play again!

Initial Impression: Theme and mechanisms are tightly interwoven in this game. Because most of the rules can be understood based on common sense, I can teach this game in just a few short minutes. This highly tactical game seems to have many different paths to victory. Expect heavy amounts of player interaction, both indirect (herbivores scrambling for limited food supplies) and direct (carnivores eating other species). Interesting card combos add flavor to the game. My family took to this game instantly.

No actual decision making to be made n this in this game, I'm not sure it even qualifies as a game since it basically plays itself. Oh they have climbing and the only way I can hunt them is with climbing? Guess I'll get climbing. Oh they Got defensive herding guess I'll get pack hunting. Its impossible to actually "play" a carnivore as your decisions are always made for you. Often there will be few maybe even only 1 species you're eligible to even try and hunt. Yet the carnivore is a necessary evil to prevent the game form being multiplayer solitaire, which I guess there's nothing wrong with liking. It's just that there are hundreds of games that do that better.

Mooie kaarten met mooie kleuren.

Je beheert kuddes van dieren, die je kan groter maken (in aantal of size).  Via eigenschappen maak je er sterkere dieren van, of hebben ze extra features of worden het carnivoren.

Elke kudde dient gevoed of sterft uit.  Ngl. de soort is dit met planten vanuit de poel, of met vlees door andere dieren te doden.

Gelukselement = welke kaarten (features) krijg je ter beschikking
Maar door slim te combineren is elke combi van kaarten goed bruikbaar.

I own the first ever Kickstarter edition and it comes with a lot of neat freebies like coasters, extra first player markers and relatively cheaper price point. A tactical strategic card game with beautiful watercolour art that really fits the Evolution theme.

I like the theme and enjoyed the way the game played. There are certain combos that seem to dominate, so experienced players will likely have an easy time of it against newer players.

RATING: 6
Good components, good art, strong feeling of a Euro, but falls a bit flat with me. Too much randomness with the cards compounded by traits that don't seem well balanced. Games I do well in, I feel like I got dealt good cards and vice versa for games I do poorly in. It's nearly impossible to develop any strategy that extends beyond the cards you're currently holding. I'm perfectly fine playing this but I wouldn't seek it out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
They finally made a FUN educational game. Cards are extremely thematic, and provide gameplay that is simple to explain, but contains true strategic depth. You are thinking non stop, and playing close attention to the traits your opponent(s) play. What's even cooler is that species actually evolve. If a players animals are repeatedly attacked by their opponents carnivore, they will start playing defensive traits. Cool, thematic implementation of a concept that has so much potential to be boring. Definitely at least a must-play.

A small beef with this game.  I thought North Star Games would be the one that could make a gamer's game that would be accessible.  Nothing could be further from the truth on this one.  

So my first turn out, I was, "What the hell, I'll make a carnivore."   Everyone else's first turn out was, "What the hell, I'll be sure to have climbing, burrowing, warning call (and negate that carnivore)."   The thing is, they couldn't have known as I was casting traits secretly---so this was just knowledge that everyone 'just knew' except me, the new guy at the table.

Right out the gate, there was nothing I could eat, and he starves to death.   This would be fine, but all the cards I laid-out thinking were good moves, were gone.  I was down a creature, and I got less cards the next round.  Being down early, you're hosed.   

I'm fine coming in last in my first game.  I'm fine knowing there's not a chance in hell of winning.  I'm not fine being a position where I wasn't concerned about making an impact or doing well, but rather having something meaningful to do, at all.

Nothing I've ever played captures the essence of making me feel fucking stupid like this one did.  The people I was playing with were being ultra nice to me both out of courtesy and also clearly I wasn't the guy they needed to worry about.

While the mechanics were all there, and the mechanics of the game were sound, I did NOT enjoy this, and I can't think of anyone I would introduce this to.  I like my games to at least give a newbie a chance or create a safe space to have shit to do.  Someone said, "If you win your first game of this, someone is being very nice to you."   

Basically though, fuck this game.

I rated this a '3' because I would give it a shot again if I were asked, I would likely know better than to make these mistakes...but it's a poor game that treats new players this badly.

Enjoy this game, fairly easy to learn and teach.  Others also enjoy.  The game depends on both luck and skill, as you always want to draw the right card.
The only issue I have with the game is that once it has been played 20 or 30 times the best strategy is known, and there is not much to learn after those plays.

This game achieves unbelievable depth and variety of strategy despite a very simple ruleset; this is the trademark of a timeless classic.  The only hesitation I have (which prevents me from rating this a ten) is that it feels at times that things like flying creatures are conspicuously missing, to the point where it feels like some potential traits were withheld in order to make an expansion more appealing.

This isn't uncommon, of course, but it makes it so that this game comes across as almost perfect, with a couple gaps, instead of utterly perfect.

What a great game.  I enjoy creating and evolving my species.  I have not played this with anyone who has not liked the game.  The game shines at 4 and plays well at 3 and 5 (with experienced players).  I do not recommend playing with 6 as there is too much going on.  I have yet to play two players.

Some game-plays are great and well balanced... some games aren't. Some players will get this amazing chain of cooperation and symbiosis cards that affects 3-4 of their species while others are stuck being consumed by every carnivore created. Other games everyone is doing alright fending off starvation until the food dries up and species are dying left and right. What you can do depends heavily on the "heart of the cards". Hope that you get some good card combos or else watch your species die. C'est la vie.

From what I saw it seemed like a great and unique interactive deckbuilder. But it probably gets a bit stale, plus it encourages you to diversify rather than specialize, and carnivores are very rare. I could be wrong though.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
Actually thought I would like this one WAY more than i did.  By only getting 4 cards, and not doing any sort of draft, the game felt like it kind of played its self.  It wasn't horrible long, but if you get behind early, it seems almost impossible to catch up (at least in a 6p game).  Something I'd play again if someone really wanted to, but not something I'll be requesting anytime soon...

Update:
------------------------
Found it more interesting with less players, but still I don't find the card combos that interesting.  I also feel like without card drafting, your control is much smaller, since you have no idea what your opponents will draw.  Still not sure I get the hype on this one.

Evolution is a pretty neat game. It's sort of an open ended game letting you do what you want, while providing a mechanic for strategy(the watering hole).

I played a turn 1 carnivore. My opponents never managed to get a carnivore on the table. I won the game. It's flavourful, but seems unfair and unbalanced. Food mechanic is a good one. Having the right counter is assigned randomly. Runaway leader and bash the loser problems. Turn order makes a huge difference.

A game that shows the harsh condition of nature. You can get Supremacy with one of your Species or you will end as a meal of one of the bigger animals which prefers meat.

In a three players game, one player feeds two better players....

Played at Spiel '15.
Reimplementation of Evolution: The Origin of Species. The possibilities for long-term strategy are much improved. However, the amount of luck is quite similar and so is the overall feel of the game. 
The artwork is the aspect of the game that changed the most. The new game has very colorful, almost expressionistic images, whereas the images in the old game are simple but stylish.
Looking at the price and the box size of the new game, the old one deserves an equal recommendation.
The biggest improvement compared to Evolution: The Origion of Species is the player influence on the amount of food that is available.
The biggest downgrade in my opinion is the only-three-traits-per-species rule, making Evolution a much more static game than its predecessor (which, granted, is a bit too dynamic).

I really like this game. It has a sufficient level of complexity and variations in style of play, yet is not as much up to chance as other games of it's type. The mechanics are a bit difficult to understand at first, and I've played a few times in which new players don't realize their mistakes until many turns later. The whole field has to balance the number of herbivores versus carnivores in order for all to profit. 

Downside: there are clearly a few winning strategies that are dominant. In my experience, the player who is best able to use the Cooperate ability will win the game. This is a highly broken ability that has the ability to stack on top of itself and create chain-feeding reactions.

Is Evolution good? : Yes

That said, it seems to get better and better after each game. There are, as everyone says, "many paths to victory", and a game winning strategy can be poor the next game.
This very simple game can become surprisingly "violent".

The theme is very present as we literally feel the struggle for life. This feeling may only come after a few games, but it's very present.

A unique game, that's what makes it great! And the design is beautiful!

Can't wait to try Flight Expansion!

It plays up to six players.

RATING: 8
Love the curve on this game - just when you think things are nice and safe it becomes a deadly fight for survival. Things really can turn on... well, a turn. Even with 2, this game can get desperate fast!

This is a really nice little combo builder. It's accessible but rife with tough decisions, and extremely interactive. The pacing and playtime just feel perfect for its weight. There random element does more to present you with opportunities, rather than destroy your strategies.

Speaking of that, this game does something pretty interesting for a combo-builder: rather than rely on tons of card synergies for its strategies, this game has comparatively few. There really aren't many unique cards, so the exact builds of your species won't change too much from game to game - instead this game is more about your [i]general[/i] strategy. And since so much is about managing your card economy and timing, you have good reason to do things differently from game to game without having to memorize a ton of content. The result in a game that is more [i]instantly[/i] fun and understandable than just about anything else in the genre.

I also usually dislike "take that!" mechanics but they are extremely well-integrated here. A lot has been done to make losing species feel like a natural part of the game, rather than a kick in the pants.

While 2p is fun, this is better with more. With two, it's easy for someone to get a species advantage early and then the other player is stuck playing catch-up for the rest of the game. It's still tense and interesting, but not ideal.

Way more aggressive than I had initially thought. The game makes sense in the theory of evolving species, kind of cool the way species adapt with trait combinations. Clever game and the Scoring is very simple.

I really didn't like the previous version of this game and was very weary to try this but a lot of friends played it in Essen and liked it so much that they bought it. Played it with the flight expansion and although better I still didn't like it. I just really don't like the fact that the things you 'build' can be destroyed.. Furthermore I felt I was not able to immediately identify some sort of strategy and that was just not a good feeling. 

Can see why a lot of people like it but its just not for me.

RATING: 6.5
This has the potential to be a really great game. My number of plays shows I like it, or am trying to like it. There's great ideas and it works with the theme.

Now, the fly in the ointment. It's REALLY swingy and suffers badly from a runaway leader problem. Get a great starting hand and follow that with a couple more? You're off to the races! Get a bum hand, and then get your species whittled down? Now it's just a slog to the end watching the other players rack up points & have fun. Once you've been knocked down it's really, really hard to come back from it.

I want to like the game more, I really do. But that problem has left a bad taste right now.

I bought evolution on a whim, having fairly low expectations for it.  I thought it could end up being a little "too" simple.  Even the first playtest didn't blow me away.  I was afraid that I would master the game too quickly or become bored with the limited number of traits available.

But something kept happening whenever I let my friends choose which games they wanted to play.  Evolution looked like the "cool" one that they really wanted to try.  

To me the game feels a bit like poker, where you're trying to construct the best group of species with your hand to get the most chips (food) in the pot (watering hole)

Pros:
1) It's very simple to set up and clean up
2) Easy to learn, hard to master
3) lots and lots of replayability
4) emergent and synergistic properties between the card types amount to over 4,000 different types of species, giving players a huge amount of strategic freedom and multiple ways to win
5) the game can accommodate 2-6 (but really shines with 3 to 4 players) 
6) The game has an ebb and flow of advantages, so that you really have to plan ahead and think about present and future turns
7) this is hardly solitaire, players have to be keenly aware of what their opponents are up to and outplay them
8) Forcing an opponent to eat or kill off their own species is immensely satisfying


Cons
1) The provided cheat sheets are helpful, but don't entirely explain some of the key points in the game, namely carnivore feeding.
2) The game can be difficult if you have a few badly constructed or unlucky turns.  If your opponent(s) end up with a significantly more species than you, they'll draw more trait cards and will be more likely to win.  
3) There is no such thing as a super-carnivore, but it definitely feels like some herbivore arrangements are impenetrable to attack and very powerful in the long run.

Overall, winning depends on a fair amount of luck but also a good application of skill to play the cards life dealt you.  9/10 would play it any chance I get

RATING: 7
As far as card game go, you can't beat the production value here (beautiful artwork, awesome player boards for each species, sweet dinosaur first player marker). I thought being a carnivore was too aggressive and mean at first, as I wiped out several species in the first rounds. However, that didn't seem to hold people back, as they soon evolved the ability to hide, climb, or protect themselves from me.

A big hit with my oldest son who is obsessed with Dinosaurs.  With a bit of help our middle son did quite well too and even won his first game.  When I can convince my wife that it's not actually a kids game there is enough strategy in there to make it really interesting as well.

Almost defies description of a game. The only redeeming quality is there's some interesting interaction between carnivores, herbivores, and the watering hole. But ultimately it comes down to who goes 2nd having a significant advantage along with whoever is able to create the biggest and largest carnivores to eat everything else. Thus the game is basically "solved" after one play-through.

I was really hoping to love this ... The theme alone should make it one of my favourites. But it just didn't grab me.

A good game, but I can see how with 5 players it becomes a bit luck-dependent. At first it seemed that body size is not particularly useful, but after I realised that carnivores can attack multiple times, I understood that larger body means a smaller population loss. Having too many species, while appearing lucrative at first, can quickly throw you down a hole of quantity-over-quality, meaning that you must walk a fine line between population and number of species as well as body size and your species' traits to win. Can't wait to try the expansion.

This game hits the spot of somehow being very simple, but at the same time being deeply strategic and tactical! It seems so simple at first glance, but this game is a flower that opens and blooms the more you explore the synergies between the different traits.  There are a lot of interesting decisions to be made from turn 1 of this game all through the end.  This game is more than a game with the them of evolution, rather it is a game about playing the people and the table where you are evolving your play throughout the game. Sometimes you are evolving preemptively, but more often reactivity to the evolution and introduction of new species by each player's ecosystem(not to mention your own- the idea of introducing a new species in your own tableau just so you can feed off of it is mind-boggling and exciting!). Evolution is not just the name of the game, it's the heart and soul of the game! Such an underrated game that has so much to offer than just a fun time (although it has that in spades)!

RATING: 4
Another "lots of cards that do stuff" game. I'm finding myself pretty tired of those sorts of games. And I say that having won my game pretty comfortably. Although it gets a 4 instead of 3 because at least a bunch of the cards persist, so you can react to them. But there's a lot of "ok, so what does everyone have in front of themselves?" which I find tedious. Might be +1 as 3 or 4 player game. I played with 5 or 6.

Best game I've ever played. Every time we play I somehow struggle to keep more than one species alive (and I teach evolution...) so I'm nearly always in last place, but I've never had so much fun losing. There are so many concepts of science in the game that it completely tickles my fancy. There are so many ways to approach the game: do I favor a carnivore? make large creatures with small populations? make small creatures with large populations? how many traits?...there's just so many different ways to attack the game.

I enjoyed every single game I played so far. It is really cut-throat competition (as an evolution game probably has to be) ... and I just get the impression, I just scratched the surface of all the possibilities. 

And the game really catches the theme ... afterwards there are some stories to tell - of the one big, fat animal that was very fit to survive but never managed to really get any offspring ... the shrieking climbing hamster, that helped to warn the whole colony until he got eaten ... 

And yes, it also has some wonderful artwork to look at!

Tight and quite thematic gameplay. The intricacies of the interactions between species need some time to work out, but once everyone "gets it", this is a highly interactive and clever game. Carnivores can be tricky for new players, as they either wipe out a species for hefty point swings or piggy-back on the success of established herbivore species. Just remember you're not locked into your choices, adaptation is king.

Very interesting game.  You're creating species that take on different traits that make it a better eater, forager, hider, predator, etc.  The idea is to eat the most food.  The player with the most food at the end wins.  The game can even be played where you raise up your tiny herbivores strictly for the use of feeding your carnivores.  Like I said, interesting.  It's pretty fun too!

Surprisingly deep strategy. I can see this scaling well with different group sizes as well. It's easy to explain, although I've already found a few rules nuances that I missed at first.

Evolution is a good next step for the North Star line - a game that's still pretty easy to learn, but there is more strategic depth here. The components are nicely done - great art.

This game is possibly most similar to Small World, in that each round players are trying to decide if they should expand by adding more species and enhancing them with traits, or acknowledging that some of them might die off. Since all that matters is how much food they consume along the way, it's perfectly fine to just let those species go sometimes.

While I like this game, right now I feel like it's ripe for expansions to make it a really satisfying experience for regular gamers. In particular it's overly challenging to have a carnivorous species, which I think could be easily corrected with more trait cards added to help them.

My rating is a fragile one, but I'm no longer so keen to play a couple more times and either solidify or shatter it, having played Evolution: Climate a number of times. However, my gripes with E:C don't apply to the base game only.

The central question for me: do the cards you draw *control* what you must do (with few meaningful decisions), or do they simply *constrain* you among some # of plausibly-viable alternatives (with plenty of interesting decisions)?

8 is a high rating, but, this one I think will stick regardless. I liked this one quite a bit when I played the "original" (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71021/evolution-origin-species).  Although I did like the clean artwork of the original, the artwork on this version is quite nice.

I geek out pretty good on animals and evolution, so I knew this one would be right up my alley.  

One thing I have noticed is that players that lack experience are hammered pretty good, I'll have to make sure to discover what the pitfalls are, and describe them well.

RATING: 7.6
I was absolutely smitten with this game when I first got it and have thoroughly enjoyed the 4 plays I've gotten out of it so far.  The theme jumps right out at you and forces you into a lush prehistoric world before humans decided to make the Earth their personal dumpster, where animals are evolving to better compete for survival.  It really feels like you're evolving through the ages to stay relevant as a species and the way you evolve depends on how much food is available and what other species are co-existing with you.
  This is essentially a card game with the creature boards to keep track of your stats for your various species and boy does this game feel like more than the sum of its parts.  Only gripe, and its a fair one, is I feel the game might get dry and predictable with more plays due to the limited nature of cards and potential combos.  Hopefully the Climate expansion fixes this and it's definitely on my radar.
  Overall this is a game that should not be overlooked, I recommend it.

This is a surprisingly good update to the original version.  The way food is added to the pool is much more strategic and interesting.

Eh, it's ok. It does have good theme, but it's too light for my tastes. Also, it seems that having a carnivore early can be a significant advantage. That is, unless you can't manage to draw Ambush or Pack Hunter, in which case you're screwed if you took that route. Plus, once you're down, it's very difficult to recover. At least it's short.

Anyway, just filler for me.

[2017-04-14 - First Impression (Note: I'm talking about the german version)]
I've enjoyed my first play of Evolution. There's quite a bit of hand management, some nice player interaction and also room for clever plays. It was fun trying to search for the best combination of traits within the current environment. I wouldn't mind playing this game more often, although I'm not sure if this will happen. 

The problem seems to be me and my gaming group. Most of them have a background playing Magic: The Gathering which means they want to understand the interdependencies of the traits in detail and therefore prefer perfectly defined keywords. At least the german version lacks in this department: Some cards talk about "eating food", some cards talk about "taking food". We figured this would be the same, but why are two different terms used for one thing? This "legal" questions slowed the game really down and left some of us with a slightly negative first impression.

Maybe I'll just wait for the app and play it a bunch of times so that I know the official rulings of most of the edge cases. However, I'd like to explore this game a little more.

I was not a big fan of this game on my first play.  It seems like the only hope is to get some good defensive cards so that you can protect your critters.  Focus ability on growing population..and if needed (depending on traits) grow body size.  I won fairly easily based on a good defensive position and just 2 species.  I'm not complaining about the defense abilities though..without that it becomes a simple "take that".

RATING: 6
Okay game that models the evolution of creatures to some degree, focusing specifically on the competition between species. It does lack the influence of climate, a major driver of evolving creatures (an expansion is evidently on the way). The arc of the game is not quite satisfying, more of just trying to keep the species engine humming. I recommend simplifying end game scoring to just counting accumulated food tokens. It's worth a try.

There were not enough interesting decisions to maintain interest in the game.

RATING: 7
Promising, and needs more plays.  Likely to be rated higher in the future after more than one play in.  It's not entirely clear how I need to be playing this game yet, but it was extremely thematic and engaging.

Update:  The second play was more fun.  Upgraded from 6.5 to 7.  I have a feeling this is about where it'll settle.  This game is fun, and extremely thematic but fails to really capture my imagination.

RATING: 6
My rating and comments are my reflections on the two player game.  I never played it with more, and I could see it being a really fun game with four or more.

The theme really shines in this game.  It's all about trying to get a big share of food and shafting everyone else.  It's a battle for watering hole dominance, and not everyone is going to come out alive. 

Attacking other players can be really in your face, and I don't like the wild swing between defensive and offensive play.

If you can't handle getting your stuff destroyed, or destroying other players then you may not like this.  You can really mess someone's day up and vice versa.

I think everything about this game design is brilliant, but the fun I have with it is very limited. I'm not really into games where every turn is an attempt to one-up everyone else, and Evolution feels that way to me.

RATING: 7.75
This is a great card-based game in which players use different traits to build their species in a competition for food with the other players' species.  The game is highly thematic with animal traits such as "long neck" and "foraging" that gain you the edge in food consumption.  Of course, players have the option of evolving their species into a carnivore to prey on the other animals.  Traits such as "intelligence" and "pack hunting" will aid in your hunting endeavors while other players use defensive traits such as "hard shell" or "horns" to counter carnivores.  The way each species evolves to deal with predators/prey or food shortages is extremely thematic.  One drawback is the luck of the card draw.  However, I still enjoyed this one!  Recommended.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Hand management and using cards for multiple purposes, with a little take-that. It was a surprise that I even liked this, but it has proved itself to be a rather compelling game.

Just don't play with all the cards mixed in. Take out a good third or so, otherwise the game will outstay its welcome.

Played it with some friends.
At times feels a bit random, with some people getting perfect card combo's going, while others get cards that don't combo well together and leave no protection.
Have found that big bodies aren't even a great defense, as it actually makes you a nicer pray to eat.
So if playing with more then 2... it's actually better to keep the smaller bodies but with well protected animals. that way, it's also not interesting to attack your creatures with predators that need intelligence activated for instance, as it can cost them as much as it would gain them.

I do like the theme and mechanics... but they seem to fall short on occasion.

I came into this game with low expectations, but that was completely unfounded. The incorporation of evolution as both a theme and mechanic makes this game come to life. And the decisions of how to play trait cards are wonderful. Should I bolster my body size, apply a new trait, or start a new species? These options are triggered in the same way, but can lead to very different game paths.

I find the ping pong interaction (up a track, down a track, etc.) more irritating than fun and as more and more cards come into play, it becomes tedious verifying whether card A affects card B or whether card B negates card A.   That being said, it is a well-designed game that card combo lovers should enjoy.

In Evolution, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk. Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.

Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules. The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table. Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players. Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business. Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory. And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting. So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.

"The theme of evolution is not just tacked on: it drives play." - Nature (the world's most prestigious scientific journal)
Evolution was covered in the journal Nature. The article was written by Stuart West, a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Oxford who has used Evolution in his undergraduate class.

Unique game with fun interactions and strategy.  rating based on one 3 player play, I think this needs another player to make it work best.  seems pretty balanced, with very little luck factor and no one really runs away with the game.  good artwork and pieces.   would definitely play again because there's a lot of paths to win and I like being able to attack other players and you can really tell when you make mistakes which makes for good discussions too.   helps to play with quick decision makers, our game took over 90 min.  good game overall.

It's interesting and I have to get a few more games in. However, with 2 and 3 players it's a bit long for what it is because you keep on doing the same things, so I recommend removing some of the trait cards to shorten the game (you already take out 40 when playing with 2 players, but I think you can take out between 50 and 60, and 30-40 with 3 players). The game is probably best with 4 or 5 players.

Interesting ideas, but the arms race between the carnivores and the herbivores wasn't something I enjoyed.  Was curious to try it once, but a half game in where two thirds of the table hated it was enough to confirm it wasn't for me.  Maybe it would be better with more than 3p, since the carnivores have more targets.

RATING: 8
Really impressed with this game! I thought having so many copies of the same cards throughout the shared deck would be bad, but it makes sense considering how many different species each player can have throughout the game. Really love the interplay between herbivores and carnivores. The theme in this game in general is very rich. You can feel the tension each round, not knowing if your opponents are planning to play lower food cards and become carnivores. This game offers good player interaction, tough card play choices, and the game length is perfect. However, it does require 4+ players for the best experience.

I quite like this one but some of the cards are strictly better than others (fat stores) whilst others are very circumstantial. The early carnivore was a huge bully but that just meant all the herbivores then became very defensive.

I really disliked carnivore turn one as this meant to create a new species you had to essentially hold you cards for two turns to have enough resources to create the species and then give it enough defences/body size/ population.

We actually played quite a friendly game where we were all putting a decent amount of food into the waterhole, so no species actually starved, save for the last turn where the last player had to knock a population down to 5 from 6 as he miss counted and was a food short.

Played once. Game was impressive for how dynamic it was. Species waxed and waned in effectiveness, and the presence/absence of strong predators strongly affected other species' success.

We had some really funny combos as well (a huge burrowing animal with long neck living symbiotically with a horde of small defensively herding foragers).

Final score was very one sided (~90 vs 50 and 50), but I think this was a result of us not knowing what to do. 
Both losing players gambled on early carnivores, which in hindsight seems bad. Perhaps it is only realistic that being a carnivore only pays off when you have some established races to prey on.

Rating = 8. I can easily see this increasing with further plays.

The number of different traits isn't too many that you're constantly referring to the guide, and it's fairly straightforward what you get to do on your turn.

Evolution is chock-full of elements I don't like in a game: Lots of different cards that players need to know about up front. Check.

Check. Uninteresting and obvious "strategies." Check. Not for me. Check.

Tierfütterung in Darwinland: mit Hilfe von Eigenschaftskarten macht man vorsintflutliche Tierarten fit für den Überlebenskampf am Futterteich. Denn jeder Fress-Chip ist ein Siegpunkt. Zu Beginn noch ein harmloses Gerangel von Pflanzenfressern, mutiert das Kartenspielchen mit dem Einsatz von Fleischfressern zu einem Kampf gegen Mitspieler. Die Fleischfresser sind das Salz in der Suppe, die ohne diese kompetitive Note in einer müder Verteilung von Siegpunktplättchen verenden würde. Andererseits kann man den Fleischfresser mit entsprechendem Schutz am langen Arm auch ziemlich verhungern lassen.

There is a large amount of guesswork and second guesswork at what other players are trying to accomplish, making for an interesting table. Carnivores offer a method of directly attacking other players, but the attacks are by and large fairly inoffensive. It is incredibly difficult to maintain a carnivore with the number of defensive opportunities available most turns.
It plays partially like an engine-building game, but due to how volatile those engines are, it ultimately comes out more like point-salad style optimization played through the meta-game based upon how much food other players populate into the watering hole.

RATING: 5.21
I had high expectations for this card game, because (as a Dominant Species fan) I love its theme.

It is a very clunky game, with run away leader issues: once one player gets to become a carnivore, unless you have a lot of defensive modifiers, consider yourself out of the game.

I hate when someone convince the group to play a "card" game for being "shorter", and it tooks longer than a "board" one would really take. The argument "let's play a card game because it is shorter" is a big fallacy, and this game is one example that takes too long for what it is.

The game's owner also commented he removed some cards from KS campaign, because they are unbalanced. I just thought, without saying, "...even more?". 

I would not play it again unless there wasn't other (better) options.

It's a real snoozefest. I'm glad I had a chance to try before buying.

I often love combo card games like this. And the theme is very much up my alley! Evolution has some good things going for it: beautiful artwork, simple ruleset, and opportunities to try different combinations of cards for maximum impact. However, by the end of the game I looked back on the experience and didn't quite recall myself having much fun or excitement. It was novel to explore its possibilities. The cards all worked and nothing was wonky. But I felt the game made it too easy to take on a position of either defensive turtling or downright bash the supposed leader.  With just over 15 card types (which might seem like a lot) I just didn't feel future games of this would feel varied enough to hold my interest. The need to respond to opponent card play felt rather scripted, with defense cards specifically naming the attack cards that they would block (which I get is what evolution is all about but it's too simplified here). Also, didn't like how everything looked on the table - sort of a sprawling mess of cards and boards. I think it's well designed and perhaps the expansion adds just enough variety to it that I would enjoy the experience more; but when I consider the games out there I love have similar mechanics, Evolution just didn't get on the list.

RATING: 9
This game's representation of darwinian adaptation is simply brilliant. 

The rules are simple and unambiguous. They establish a clear, basic framework of a limited food supply and player options for changing that supply or their relationship to it by mutating their species traits, or changing one of two core aspects, population and body size, that affect their consumption of food and resistance to predators (respectively). All of these options are allowed through the multiple-use cards in their hand, giving players a satisfying set of decisions every turn about how to best use this hand to adapt to the constantly shifting game state (e.g. inject more/less food into the supply? change to a carnivore to start attacking other players? add traits to prevent them from attacking us? increase our population to eat more and get more points? etc. etc. etc.)

That's the entire game, in terms of mechanics, but the emergent butterfly-effects that unfurl during gameplay are spectacular.

It's a sign of excellent game design when a game's complexity manifests in its play and dynamic interactions between players, rather than overly legislative rule sets or overloaded point options. 

I also enjoy the creative aspect of imagining my own species based on the weird trait combinations that I've assigned. It has a similar appeal to monster creation in Shadows of Malice. An armoured herd of giraffe-like long-necked creatures with a maxed out, mastodon body size? Sure, I can imagine that!

A cool card building game where you are "evolving" your species and trying to eat the most food (vp)

Has a neat paper/rock/scissor thing going between traits that let your species feed better, eaten, or defense/survival.

Game plays best with 4, allowing for some tactical decisions where you guess if your opponent is planning to evolve into a meat eater or going heavy foraging.

Plays in about 1h. Base game cards can start to get a bit stale but the expansion modules keep things fresh

After one game. I thought I'd get it back on the table soon, but as time went on and I tried other games, that desire gets weaker and weaker. Now, I'm not sure I really want to try it again. Might be too abstract for my tastes, and just didn't seem all that fun. Our group had more fun, more laughs playing our first game of Primordial Soup, as fiddly and as visually unappealing as that game was, compared to Evolution.

Update: Sold after I decided I'd rather play other games.

What a great game. The components in this are very well done. Beautiful artwork on the cards and even the little players bags were a nice touch. The food bank board is sturdy and beautiful as well.

The game itself is very easy to learn and teach in a short period of time. It's a great balance between the herbivores and the carnivores and the game doesn't become overly cutthroat, as your strategies will constantly be switching during the game. It all really works well and is loads of fun on top of it.

Do be sure you get the correct 2nd edition of the game if you're planning on picking up the Flight expansion, as there are copys out there that have the wrong decks and you'll need to buy a new deck from the company if you want all the cards to match. As far as I know, this is only a issue with the games being sold at Barnes & Noble and Books a Million, but it's best to be sure. The edition you want has a yellow fertile card on the back of the box, rather than a green one.

I'd say this is a good game for everyone, from gamers to family and friends. Check out the videos and judge for yourself. I'm glad I did and can't wait to try this with the expansion.

Many divergent strategies supported. Theme fits very well.  Outcome and mechanics seem   very true to nature.  Boom and bust, adaptation, attack and defense.

I would gladly have traded the really big dinosaur start piece for decent cards.

Early yet so my judgment isn't final.  It's well designed.  The fundamental game flow, a boardwide ecosystem in an evershifting equilibrium, is compelling.

But the game runs slow for such a light game.  I would strongly recommend using the simultaneous rules, even at the expense of a bit of strategy.  My biggest issue, however, is that it's so incremental that it features almost no points of tension.  It's a long-run slog of progressive buildup without any identifiable memorable moments.  You'll win or lose but it's unlikely you'll pinpoint any decisive card or turn.

Actually a nice game with a good and unique theme. However, the card deck is quite small. After a few plays all cards and best combos are known and it becomes a bit boring. Furthermore, in an advanced gaming group, carnivores are difficult to play efficiently and, hence, avoided what makes the game even more boring.

Played solo learning game (3p). Was completely underwhelmed. Play trait cards, feed your species, rinse and repeat. Maybe as more species are created (I got up to 7 total) and food gets more scarce there is more tension. I was too bored to play to that point. I play solo learning games to be able to teach the game to those I play with and also to decide if a game is something I want to introduce. This will not be one. I will be putting this up for trade/sell.

After one play, I can definitively say I like it, but then again I like most tactical card games. The theme really shines through on this one. The decision as to when to put certain traits on certain species is a skill that will have to be learned over time. All my critiques of this game will probably go away upon future plays. First, the game is a little long for what it is (players will get more efficient and speed up play over time). Second, it's hard to see what traits are on what species, what they do, and how they interact with each other when you are late in a four player game and all the cards are sprawled out on the table (all of this will become second nature once we know the traits better). Finally, the rules for when to take food onto your species boards versus in your food bag based on special traits are unclear (nothing a BGG search can't fix). I look forward to playing this some more.

Very aggressive game. You can have 4 species one turn and only 1 the next turn depending on how the feeding phase goes.

Can get a little confusing, especially with more players and higher species counts. When carnivores have to feed, you'll be asking the other players a lot about what traits are active.

Lehetőségem volt kipróbálni a játékot, amelyről előtte már rengeteget hallottam, olvastam a különböző fórumokon.
Első hallásra nagyon megtetszett, így érdeklődve vártam mit is tud.
A kis zacskók, kezdőjátékos dinó-jelző (szerintem ezzel mindenki előad egy kis show-t) és kezdő állatfaj kiosztása után gyors szabálymagyarázat (egyszerű szabályok, nopara) jöhet a „kártyázás”. Lehetőségeid szerint több fajt állítasz elő boszorkánykonyhádban azzal a céllal, hogy a legtöbb győzelmi pontnak megfelelő korongot szerezd meg (egyszerűen zabáltatni kell őket és kész – bár nem olyan egyszerű, mint amilyennek hangzik). Aránylag gyors a játékmenet, a kártyákat pár forduló után ismerni fogod, bár a nyeréshez nem árt, ha szerencsés laphúzáson kívül egy-egy jó kombinációt is elő tudsz állítani. Örök dilemmád lesz, hogy ragadozzak vagy békés növényevő legyek? Természetesen húsevőként tudsz gonoszkodni és azokat felenni az elérhető húsikából, akik nem szimpatikusak. Itt azért a királycsinálás általam „utált” verziója is bekövetkezik (javasolt azokat enni, akik valószínűleg vezetnek). A játék során egészen „eszement” fajokat vagy képes megteremteni, de mindent a túlélésért. A húzópakli elfogyásával a játék is véget ér és következik a végelszámolás.
Kellemes játék, de valamiért nem fogott meg. Ez csak szubjektív vélemény, de én inkább játszom mást helyette. Egy próbát mindenképpen megér!

I don't know if I like this more than the original, but it's a good game for sure. I would say it's much more friendly and not as nasty, but at the same time more strategical.

While you can't make super-monsters with xx traits, you can play with the body-size and population which gives you more control and makes it less deadly.

Will need more plays to decide.

I am normally not a fan of card games, but the Evolution series does a fantastic job of merging theme with strategy.  A very "thinky" game with simple but high quality components and artwork.  Grow your species in size and population to compete for food resources with other players.  Evolve your species by adding or removing traits to outcompete your opponents, avoid (their) predators, or feed (your) predators.  The Flight and Climate expansions add interesting elements to gameplay.

It's a fine designed game, I really appreciate the theme and think the implementation is pretty unique. I already liked the predecessor with its minimalism, and I admit that the food source mechanism (now cards; before dice) was much improved in this version.

Yet, I don't have much fun playing this game. Maybe it's the high interaction: you're constantly attacking people or are busy protecting against the other players. It stresses me out.

(The artwork is fine, although also not *my* cup of tea.)

RATING: 8.3
I tought this is kind of an average game, that you usually won't play any more. I was wrong, it is one hell of a great one! The rules are very easy to teach yet the strategy is pretty deep. It has an outstanding, eyecatching artwork you might want to play two games in a row. The game implementation to the theme is gorgous you really feel like doing your way to surive. Hopefully a game where the interaction is more than just observing your enemies. If you want to be the winner in the end you must keep on adjusting your strategy to your enemies. If you are all playing defensivle you will find yourself fighting for food so fast you can't even remember, if there are some species you constantly have to think how to survive or how to feed these animals. It also has the needed combinations i love in Glory To Rome for example, the more i play it the more i love it. However unfortunatelly the game itself is super expensive and im not sure if it worth buying myself a copy. I wish if had more cards in it.

Pros / Cons: 
-Very easy to teach, yet have some depth.
-The elegant mechanics is going super smoothly with the theme.
-Because of the high interaction between the players you must constantly adjust you strategy to your enemies.
-One of the best comboing game out there.
-Outstanding artwork.

-It is overpriced, by not just a rabbit but more likely a giant.
-There aren't enough cards. I wished if there were more. Because of this i don't know if it will stand the test of time or it will be shrink to the bottom of your sheves later on.

RATING: 7.75
Evolution is a very impressive game. Like other NorthStar games, this one has obviously been thoroughly playtested, and the rules are boiled down to what as simple a flow as possible, but this statement belies the depths of the game.

Get cards (multi-use as money and as traits), setup the food pool, play cards, and eat (VP)- but the cards have a lot going on, and there are many cool interactions here to explore.

Evolution does a great job of grabbing the theme and putting into the mix here, because the traits added to animals greatly change how they fare at food and growth, and food = survival (and more VP), so you are drawn into the survival of your creatures.

The simplicity and depth combined is pretty elegant- and the dino art is great, too.

Cannot start this at less than 7.75; this is a terrific game to bring the family to, or a bunch a hungry gamers- I look forward to many more plays.

It does what it's supposed to do, it's a clever design and nearly atmospheric, but there is way too much text and too many single dependencies and the like.

Got a narrow victory although everyone else had played it repeatedly before, and now I have the feeling I am through with it. I'd play it again if someone asked, but I can gladly remove it from my wishlist now.

(10/18/2014) Comment based on two plays.

North Star Games, which is well known for popular party game titles, such as Say Anything or Wits and Wagers, has produced a family-friendly game that has enough meat to satisfy veteran gamers. This is a quick card-playing, species evolution game, along the lines of Evo, with simple rules, fast play, little downtime, and plenty of interesting choices.

What is different from Evo is that players can spawn a number of new species, and each can be differentiated with up to three traits, as well as population and body size. The play is card driven, where each card represents either a food value OR a specific trait (one of over 20?) OR population growth OR growth in body size. Each specie starts out rather generic, with one population and a size-one body, but they quickly can get unique in terms of traits.

Each turn, players get a minimum of 3x cards, and 1x card for each specie that they have. Then then secretly allocate one card to the center, to determine the amount of plant food available in a communal pool--the food value on the cards are added up, and that many food tokens are placed in the center. At first, this seems rather meaningless early on in the game when everyone has one or two species to feed, but later on, food can become a critical factor when everyone's species have grown in population. High food value cards also tend to have more desirable traits, so players will begin to agonize in the latter half of the game--put out a lot of plant food (that everyone else will share in) or keep and play a desirable trait to give one of your species a significant advantage?

Then in turn order, players play cards:
1) Discard a card to spawn a new specie--a player gets a new specie tableau, on which to track population and body size.
2) Discard a card to grow the population of an existing specie by one.
3) Discard a card to grow the body size of an existing specie by one.
4) Allocate a card (face down) to add a trait to an existing specie (up to a max of three traits--you can add more traits, but must discard to keep it at three).
5) Keep any unused cards, possibly to activate "Intelligence", which is one of the traits.

Once everyone has played their cards, and they can play as many as they wish, all allocated traits are revealed, along with the plant food amount in the center.

Then in turn order, a player can either:
1) Take a plant food token for one of their herbivore/omnivore specie, modified only if the specie's trait(s) give it an advantage.
2) Attack another player's specie (or one's own) if your specie has a carnivore trait AND your body size is larger than the prey's size, subject to any modifiers given by the attacker's and prey's traits. If successful, take a number of meat food tokens from the general supply (which is separate from the plant supply) equal to the body size of the prey; the prey's population is reduced by one.

Players continue to feed their species in turn order, until everyone has fed up to their population level, or until the plant supply in the center runs out (much like satisfying the demand in Automobile), or until all carnivores are unable to feed. All species then drop in population to the level they were able to feed. All players then "bank" the food they had collected for each specie.

If population goes to zero due to attacks, that specie is extinct, with all associated traits going into the discard. However, the player gets a number of new cards equal to the discarded traits, so a player is not completely wiped out like in other evolution games.

The game ends when the card deck is exhausted. Players add up all banked food, population level of all species, and the total number of traits on surviving species. Whomever has the most points wins.

At first glance, this reminded our group of another Kickstarter game that was a terrible copy of Evo. The game seemed a bit too much "take that", especially with a bunch of carnivore traits showing up. The game play seemed too simplistic and not meaningful, since we had not totally appreciated the advantages of each trait. However, by the second game, it had become apparent that this game has a lot of meat to it, given the various interactions that the traits give--it takes a game or two to fully understand and appreciate almost all the available traits, because it takes actual play of the trait and seeing it in action to really "get it". The entire game feels like a biological microcosm, brutal and cold, yet elegant with an self-regulating intelligence. Herbivores struggle to survive amidst carnivores; too low on population and body size, and they will be hunted into extinction. Carnivores need to keep the herbivores in check, and keeping the number of species down, lest they get overwhelmed by sheer numbers and defensive traits. Grow too much population, and eventually the food supply will vanish, and the populations will adjust back down. Growing in size gives advantages in attack and defense, yet if attacked successfully by another carnivore, the larger body size gives more meat food tokens to the attacker. Stay small, and you may be attacked easier, but certain traits make it easier to defend. On the other hand, spawning new species is possible food for the carnivores, but more cards during the draw at the beginning of each turn--more cards drawn means more traits/population/body size to beef up your existing species. At some point, if this is left unchecked, then there is a serious leader runaway problem. However, with a 60 minute playtime, this is acceptable. Also, you have no one to blame but yourself and groupthink in allowing it to happen.

Then, there is the symbiotic traits between the various species of a single player. Depending on arrangement, a specie's trait may give defensive advantages to species to the left or the right, depending on the trait, such as "Warning Call" and "Symbiosis". It may also give feeding advantages, such as "Cooperative" or "Foraging". While certain traits make it harder to attack another specie, there are traits that negate them, or having a larger population and/or larger body size may overcome the trait. All in all, this is an interesting rocks-paper-scissors interaction among the various traits--no one trait is the best, and while advantageous one round, is obsolete by the next, since species are allowed to "morph" into a new set of traits. One day they are quiet foraging herbivores, while the next day they are pack-hunting, climbing carnivores! So, there is an very tense period where players watch each others discards and allocation of traits.

This is a very well made game. The ebb and flow of the rise and fall of species is fascinating to watch, and equally entreating as players frantically play cards to make their species survivable or to flourish, in response to the traits/population/body size of the other species, as well as the available food supply. There is plenty to think about here and enjoy. It is a solid "8".

Current (as of Feb 2015) fave game.  Love the theme, love the player interaction options, love the variety.

It's simpleish to teach the basic gameplay, but there is a fairly steep stepped learning curve meaning that the first game or two for most will be tough to work out the nuances.  Once they crack that though - it's super fun.

Although I have only played this once, it was a good game; I look forward to future play. I hope to have a more thorough evaluation at that point. At this point, the biggest criticism is the rule book, namely it needs to be cleaned up, for it lacks clarity on game play. It tried to be simple, but in doing so it left out much needed information on how to appropriately play. So, along with revision...an faq or the like should be added.

I enjoy this game, though prefer playing at 3-4.
Many variables to keep track of: population, body size, defense traits, actually eating [scoring points]. You can't just ignore the other players too, you need to see what their defenses are, how much food they are going to be taking away from the middle, if they can eat you, etc, which is why lower player counts are generally preferred. 

It may be a bit too much for most people, and if it is (sniff), you can try introducing them to Evolution: Beginning first to lure them in and then when they are ready for something more gamery/strategery, pull this out.
Though I have noticed my friends that liked to chomp on other players in E:Beginning did not like the jump to Evolution (where it is harder to chomp other players). But the players that were more pacifists liked the traits that enable better plant chomping.

I really like this game, but will admit it also depends on the group I'm playing with. With some folks this is a ton of fun because people get into the creatures they are evolving, but others can make this feel more like a chore - especially if they have some of their creatures eaten by carnivores.

I also think the game isn't quite balanced as it becomes more difficult to evolve carnivores later in the game - if you don't do it early, then they'll likely go extinct rather quickly.

Got the second edition cards from backing the Flight expansion.

Saw at GenCon, my husband and I gave it a try.  I love the art. The game is fun too, as you start with one species and then add more. There are cards that give traits to your species to help them survive. You try to grow your species and outlast other players by deciding how much food to add to the "pool" and whether to create meat eaters to attack other species (yours or other players). We liked it a lot and are thinking about getting the expansion.

I'll give it another try, but the strategy choices seemed obvious and all players wind up using the same ones.

Suffers from a problem where the weakest player can get continuously beat up. It can be hard to catch up if you lose too many of your creatures. I like the building up of different traits, but some trait combinations are clearly better than others, making it difficult to ever beat players with those combos. Just kind of "meh" for me.

This is a good game and is a lot heavier than it looks but it is easy to learn. The only thing that surprised me is the large amount of table space this game takes up. In a test game, I got up to 5 species and this takes way more space than I had anticipated for a game without a board. This was my only negative about the game. You need to look at other players' cards too which is something that I don't like when there are many cards (think of the problems with ora et labora and le havre).

A decent game, but underdeveloped I'm afraid.
I really like the translation of real processes into the game mechanics, but the replayability can be quite low (not enough distinct traits).  I can easily see the game falling into the same tracks over and over again.

I wish there was a bit more of meat (not in the 'food' meaning :) ) in the game too.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Watched the rules video, first impression is its a thematic and fairly light variable power engine game with some take that in there. 

With no face up cards to draw from it looks like strategy is fairly limited so mostly a tactical game where you really have to play to the cards dealt. (there might be some I'm not seeing, like when to turn Carnivore if ever or which species to try and focus on but overall decisions don't look too plentiful and its no Pax Porfiriana). It would have been cool to have the evolutions be more tech tree in nature, again making it more strategic and a row of face up cards showing what is coming would have been nice I think

Video was only a rules explanation, a video of the actual gameplay always gives me a much more accurate gauge so my comments are very "initial". I'm a cardgame whore and so far my interest is not piqued, could make a decent filler if it plays in 30 mins or less

Edit - See the 8th & 9th post where I asked an experienced player to expand on where strategies and decisions are if curious: http://boardgamegeek.com/article/15652865

I feel like I should really like this game, it's close in theme to Dominant Species but otherwise they have no similarities.

very interesting, game, possibly one of the best of the year. it has a couple of problems though: 

1) no catch up mechanic, if you fall behind early, you have no hope of catching up, especially, if you are the only player with a species that is vulnerable to someone elses carnivore.

2) you may know which player(s) is in the lead towards the end of the game, but if you don't get lucky with card draw, there is nothing you can do to stop them.

Simple rules lead to  a very thematic experience. Can be cutthroat, but it's easy to respond to threats. Lots of options are available to you on your turn. They key is to realize that your species MUST evolve and change throughout the game. Building up one mega-species is rarely worth it. You just need to bank as much food as possible on your turns- if your species die, you can get more next time.

Gorgeous art. Very fun and simple game with some meat to it. Doesn't overstay it's welcome.

For a game with only a few options there is quite a bit of strategy.  When to attack, when to defend, when to go extinct... these decisions will have your head spinning.  Food = victory points so feeding first is a big benefit.  If you're going last, have a carnivore in reserve... just make sure you can feed it.  

Build your population early and add species if you can. Food will become scarce in the later game, so plan for it with a couple of well placed traits.

Played on BSW, but finally bought my own copy of the game.  The components actually make the game-play face-to-face a better experience.

My son Alex, has wanted this game since he saw it. I looked at the rules, the videos and just did not see a game. Finally I broke down, he is a good kid, and then we played after watching more videos. It actually is good. It has a new mechanic of eating plant eaters, sharing food for plant eaters, starving, extinction, Traits galore. It is much better then I thought. Could move to a 8 rating, with more traits, like in the flight expansion. Climate evolution on Kickstarter, might be ok. A good solid game with great components.

Made it through our first learning game and I had high hopes for it. We played a two player game and I enjoyed it but did find it quite a bit more cut throat than I thought it would be. This didn't set off fireworks but we also didn't hate the game. My wife and I want to try it again having now learnt the game and try some other strategy.  This was quite a hard game to learn for some reason as we had to refer to the manual quit a bit, but we did find an answer to all our questions, even if one of the answers was on the handy dandy player aid. I can see this game really taking off with a bigger group that doesn't mind a bit of cut throat, but with two player we didn't care for the cut throat. We lost quite a few dinosaurs in our last round and was ultimately let with a feeling of disappointment. Having said all that we both want to play this game again and I hope to amend this review to a far more positive one. I still want this game to be as good as I hoped it would be :)

RATING: 7
In Evolution, players use a fresh hand of cards each turn to create species, add traits to existing species, and grow their populations and body sizes. The key to the game is creating species that can favorably compete against the other players' species for a limited and unpredictable food supply. Consumed food, population sizes and active traits score at the end of the game.

You can assign up to three traits to any species and they generally fall into three categories - offensive, defensive, and increased consumption. They key is being able to suck down food faster than the other players since the supply is limited and food = points. The carnivore trait allows you to feed on other species rather than the food pool, but only if you have a larger body size. A lot of the negative comments I've read on this game cite the "take that" nature of the carnivores as a major turn off. While I agree that in the first play or two the game can feel that way, that's only because one hasn't yet grasped the symbiotic nature of the entire ecosystem. Sometimes the best response is not to play defensive, but to breed faster than you can be eaten, or create scavengers so that when you are fed upon it advantages your species as well. I don't see this game has having a strong "take that" element at all and those who think so I just don't think have given it a fair shake. You can also feel at a disadvantage in a first game not knowing the cards, but there aren't that many and it takes about half a game to get them down. This game has been a winner with all ages and all experiences this month, making it a good "go to" game to have in the collection!

If there's such a thing as a well-designed take-that game, Evolution could be it. For me personally, it's an impossibility. Without a doubt, there are relevant decisions in Evolution. There are clever moves. It is possible to nurture a super predator or an invincible veggie eater. But the frustration of receiving the short end of the stick wipes out all enjoyment there could be. 

Up to a certain point, it's possible to shield one's animal against predators, to prepare it to gather enough food from the waterhole before others do, or to set up your predator for successful hunts. But in the end, one player having the right trait, the other not receiving what he needs, decides about survival. It's not about being faster than the predator, being faster than the prey next door suffices. Predators are not fair, players playing them even less. Once being an easy target, the vultures gather and demand their share of the slaughter.

Keeping track of everyone's special powers was cumbersome and the swinginess bothered me. I have nothing against aggressive/attack type games, but this just wasn't fun.

RATING: 7
Players build up different species and traits with cards and attempt to survive via food and attacking. This would be a good game if it played quicker. I think the repetitiveness is a bit of a problem, as well as the length of the game.

I think I would have liked to see more ways for players to interact besides carnivores. If no one plays carnivores, there would be almost no interaction.

This system is so interesting.  You really do build your own little ecosystem amongst players in this game.  The chipboard is high quality, but the card quality is flimsier than I'd prefer.  Lots of promo cards makes setup sometimes laborious as you sort out certain promos that may clash with other cards.  Worthy of your consideration.

RATING: 6.5
Not really my kind of game. You have to pay to much attention to your opponents cards. While I wouldn't mind this so much usually, the fact that cards can have effects on each other, makes it very difficult to grasp what is going on at your opponents.

RATING: 7.5
As a big fan/collector of dinosaur/prehistoric themed games I was very excited to try this one out. Overall, it doesn't disappoint! Components are very high quality, and there's definitely a level of strategy needed to try and anticipate/pick the right cards to get your species through the round. There's a little bit of imbalance though - often you'll end up with a surplus of plant food in the watering hole; and the player with the carnivore(s), if someone chooses to utilize them, can often take a huge lead if their carnivore gets powerful earlier on. Still a great game to play, and one of the better evolution-themed games out there!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Evolution is a great mid-weight game that is easy to teach to non-gamers. There is a measure of cut-throatedness that some players may not enjoy as players may choose to evolve their critters into carnivores and directly attack other players.

A friend has Evolution and the Flight expansion. It's such a neatly designed and easily explained and played game. What a winner! During boardgame nights, it comes out a lot as it doesn't take a long time to play. We just love it. I was so excited to see Evolution Climate. A great twist! North Star are just so good and coming up with an expansion that changes the game enough to keep it interesting but not so much that you lose qualities you loved from the original. We will definitely need to add this to our collection. Can't say enough good about this game.

Family friendly game with more to it than meets the eye. In evolution you are trying to keep your species from becoming extinct. To do this you have to eat food, increase population and body size, but watch out for carnivores....they only eat meat and you are on the menu. The goal of the game is to have eaten the most food but the bigger your population and the more traits your species has also gain you victory points. Darwin had it right when he deduced that the most dominate species will always survive...and extinction isn't an option in this game!

Very good game. Wife and I played 2 player and thought the game was easy to learn and great fun. We were pretty passive on our fist play through (No one went carnivore), so out game was pretty light and not that confrontational. Going to look into the expansion and see if that adds some more flavor to the cards and game (from what I read it will). Great fun, easy to learn, wife and I enjoyed it alot.

Surprised that there weren't that many different cards and that some seemed a bit unpolished and samey, but it makes enough combinations to set up interesting dilemmas and bluffs, and the "carnivore" mechanic is brilliantly doubled-edged.

RATING: 4
Only played two player but based on the rules it seems like it would be better at higher player counts. I like the look of this game, the artwork of the animals and the watering hole are beautiful. It seems like a really neat idea to evolve your creatures to survive and adapt to the environment and other predators. But it's a really math-y game to me and the theme did not carry over well. More playthroughs with higher player counts are likely needed but it made a lackluster first impression.

Light and fluffy "short-attention span" gaming. Our crew tends to be fairly predictable in their styles: there's the giant tortoise with horns vegetarian player, the get to pack hunting carnivore player, and the hordes of 1-1 mean greenies player... but they all have their advantages. Timing is crucial, and no-one should get too attached to any one species or trait. Wish flying were more meaningful than it currently plays, though.

RATING: 8
Do you like creating little creatures with scientific sounding names? Good, you chose the right game.  In this game you will decide which attributes and traits are given to each of your populations of creatures. Evolve one race to be able to outwit a carnivore! Or burrow into the ground! Or make your creature bigger than your predators, or even make your creatures hungry for flesh(carnivore).  The game is nice to setup and as long as you understand the game explanation is easy to new players, 15 min explanation max. The game is cute on the outside but does have some hidden complexity with how you can manage your species. The expansion "Flight" is also a nice touch that in hindsight was something lacking in the original game. Games last just shy of an hour, fun to play with 2 players and up. Good for casual game night, family night, and moderate game night. The twilight imperium players may get bored.

It was an ok game. The components are great and the visual is pleasant to the eyes, but the gameplay felt bland and I did not feel like I was evolving my creatures, it felt more like I was equipping cards to my creature. I played 2 times: Once at 2 players and another time at 3 players and it already feels like I have nothing new left to the game. Plus, the game is WAY too expensive for what it is. Not too many cards, the pouches look fantastic, but you barely use them (folded boards could hide my food just as easily while reducing the cost of the game by a good amount) and the first player token. What a uselessly huge thing. Yes, it is funny and charming, but make it a fifth of its size instead of that wooden monster and you get yourself a small amount off the cost. I understand that this game was kickstarted and that most of these were stretch goals, but maybe they should've been kept as exclusives or for a deluxe version. In canada, the game is sold for 65$ to 75$, while, in my opinion, the game could be worth 45$ to 50$ without all that excess fluff.

Solid family game with an awesome theme. Grow your species and feed them. Players take turns playing as many cards from their hands as they want to either create a new species, increase their population/body size, or give their species' traits. One card must be used to contribute to the watering hole. After all players have used their cards everyone goes around taking food from the watering hole until everyone either eats or starves. Fun times. I'm going to hold off on buying this one and just get Evolution: Climate instead, due to the impending updates.

I had much higher hopes for the game, only reason I didn't rate it a six was because of the clean-up or setup time. The game itself is not bad, however I feel the game goes at almost too fast of a pace and often can make performing tactics very difficult. Not a bad idea though and will probably pick up an expansion in the near future.

RATING: 8
While not as awesome as Primordial Soup, another game with similar theme and feeling, it plays in half the time. Not to mention it plays decently enough with both three and five players, while Primordial needs exactly four to work.

Evolution is, at heart an economical game about optimization with an evolution theme, yet it has enough interaction, both direct and indirect, to avoid falling into the pure snowball economies trap. Speaking of interaction, don't expect it to be a conflict-heavy game. While carnivores do set other players back, a conflict-heavy carnivore won't score as many points as a herbivore, not to mention completely negating a carnivore is rather easy: players just need to commit resources to it. Actually, most of the damage carnivores do is indirect, forcing other players into spending resources in defending. Resources which would otherwise have been invested in scoring.

All in all, Evolution is a light-to-medium weight game with great replay value, as there are lots of possible tactics. While the rules are simple, and cards have multiple uses, which mitigate the luck factor tremendously, actually knowing how to deal with sub-optimal draws requires an in-depth understanding of the rules newbies lack. Thus, first plays can be frustrating.

A fascinating game of designing creatures through the assistance of evolution trait playing cards.  Your creatures are born, and then can evolve numerous times throughout a game via the trait cards.  The player that is able to stave off other predators, and feed there potential population of home grown creatures the best will win the game.  It's easy to learn, a quick game, and will poke at that scientifical inner Darwin.  Good game!

[u]Comments:[/u]
I didn't want to like Evolution, I really didn't. I don't think the artwork is very good, and the box is kind of hideous. I was at Game Storm 2015 and a friend came for the day and wanted to give it a shot so I checked it out of the library there. After setting up and reading through the rules I got really excited. The rules were easily understood and explained, so much so that I did it three times as people kept wanting to join in on the game so we would start over from the start. The components were well though out and very functional. Once I started playing the game I knew I had found a game that I had been searching for for awhile, an excellent evolution game. I have played a few hoping that they would be the holders of such a crown, but alas they never did. Evolution is by far and away the winner of that crown. Its mechanics while simple are pure genius in their effort to mimic what it is like for species to evolve over many million years. You start with one species and on your turn you can give that species up to three traits, or discard cards from your hand to make the species bigger or make its population grow. Once everyone has done this its feeding time. Herbivores eat from a common pool of food that everyone takes one token at a time for for any of their hungry herbivores, but this is also where the balance between carnivores and herbivores in an ecosystem really shines as a mechanic in the game. Instead of eating plants carnivores will eat other species at the table. If multiple carnivores are at the table you could see a cold war escalation as one tries to outdo the other so that they can be the sole apex predator in the system. At the end of the game you will score points for every species that doesn't go extinct (have their population drop to 0) as well as all the food your species ate throughout the game. Every time I play Evolution new strategies emerge and I find myself thinking about strategies in the game when I am not playing it. Overall the game is pure genius and needless to say as soon as I got home I ordered myself a copy. I can't wait for the expansion Kickstarter to kick off.

Very interesting game that it's hard to know how to rate.  The stated goal of the designer--which I believe it meets--is that every game has a different ecosystem, and you really have to react to ecosystem, adapt or die.

But how much does luck influence the outcome?  Really not sure yet.

Very innovative.

Really enjoyed this at 2 players. So much fun. You can strategically look what other player does.

Tried it only once at 3, I would try again since I find it less satisfying than at 2 because it's harder to anticipate what the other players will do.

--- 
Update;
Played at 3, loved it. The time where I didn't like it at 3 was the reason why the publisher decided to print a 2nd edition. We played too nicely the other time.

However this time I played with another group and they were a lot more bloodthirsty. We were constantly evolving and there was not enough food in the waterhole. Alot of player interaction and the game keep evolving.

A fun game. Sometimes can feel a bit repetitive, but it's usually a fun game to play. Can be too long with few players but that's rectified by a house rule limiting the number of cards. Predators are still underpowered, but not enough to make the game not worth playing.

This is definitely one of my favorite themes in a game ever. I love the way that the game IS the theme, something that is rarely accomplished. And the flexibility with how you can use cards is absolutely fantastic. You really can pick your strategy. I think the only reason that it isn't higher is that most plays of the game feel similar because you can take multiple strategies with multiple animals. So, there isn't the "I'm going super protected herbivores this time" route because you can have one, a predator, and a cooperative chain.

Like this game a lot.  Lots to think about.  Not as cut throat as I initially thought.  The carnivores will eat the plant eaters, but usually only have a couple of choices because cannot get through everyone's defenses.  I like that if everyone tries to be plant-eaters, some will have to switch to carnivores because there won't be enough food and vice-versa.  The question is when to switch.

A very fun game where you are putting out new species with traits to keep them from being eaten.  You try to expand the population to score points or make them bigger to not be eaten by carnivores.  

I like the game a lot.  It has an interesting expansion where you add flying species to the game.  

I would say this game is light enough for families.

Not only is this game mechanically solid, but it is also thematically solid. I feel like I am watching literal creatures grow and adapt themselves to an ever-changing environment. When there is food to spare, the plant eaters find ways to eat more of it. When food becomes scarce, species turn carnivorous and no one is safe. When carnivores stalk the land, species develop defensive techniques to prevent from being eaten. This will continue to get a lot of play at my table.

Commercial PnP edition - constructed April 2015

I really dig the theme. Some people can't seem to reconcile how the traits can shift so dramatically from turn to turn. But the turns represent very long stretches of time and the adaptations are those that can happen with significant changes to the ecological niches. I LOVE it!

RATING: 7
Rating based on single 5-player game.
Lots of downtime, ultra chaotic, early setback could ruin the whole game leaves me very disappointed. Maybe next time I should try it with 4, or preferably 3 players and see if it would become better (with more control and less downtime).
Edited on 24/1/2015:
Played 2 more games with 4 players each, some have played the old version before. Some observations here:
1. All those players keep mentioning 2 things, I) This is the Evolution 'boardgame' while the old one is Evolution 'cardgame', and II) They won't play the 'cardgame' version again as this has become much more balanced now. I haven't played the old version so I can't comment it here...
2. It is very important to get the right moment to change from herbivore to carnivore, or vice versa. The carny to herby one is especially important, as you likely have invested some cards to up its size and put some talents on it.
3. With 4 players, the downtime is easily tolerated and feels more balanced. However luck is still quite high here: If you can't get the key cards during the required moments, e.g. climbing vs others, then you may be forced to consume your own species just to feed it. With a smaller no of players it would be even easier for a player getting some perfect combination while the other/ others can't get the required cards to tackle it/ slow it down. So I think 4 player game is the sweet spot for this game.
4. I am somewhat worried about the replayability. Although I rarely get to play a game more than 10 times, I could foresee that I should be able to explore all combinations soon enough. More importantly, MOST EXPANSION DESIGNS WON'T HELP IT BY SIMPLY ADDING TALENTS as it would only make being a carnivore more difficult to tackle the elusive herbivores. Right now the game is still quite welcome and thus the rating up from 6 to 7.
Edited on 19/9/2015: played a game with Flight expansion and with the 2nd edition cards. Thanks Power Wong for helping me to get a copy of the KS version!
The cards are more thematic and even more balanced in the 2nd edition cards. This could potentially be a game with rating 7.5 or even 8 if just with the 2nd edition cards. However, the Flight expansion is very ordinary and doesn't add much to an already very balanced game. Actually I suspect some combinations with flight cards could break the almost perfect balance in the basic game.

RATING: 4
Neat concept, but the gameplay is not particularly engaging. The visuals are pretty, but they don't feel like you are building a new unique creature, just collecting cards. The experience is a bit bland. We had a 1st edition copy... I think 2nd came out less than a year after its release and included some rule tweaks. Of course, that can be a plus or minus depending how you look at it...

RATING: 5
I liked the basic idea and the general mechanisms in that one, but I feel the carnivores are flawed. You only had a chance with carnivores if the other players where really unlucky or not paying attention. Single defensive cards played on your potential prey will cost you up to 3 cards to compensate (e.g. carapace), or in the case of "climbing" you have no chance unless you are lucky and draw one too.

RATING: 5
First impression based on one 3p game.  This game for me was an eye opener.  It taught me the difference between objective and subjective.  It taught me that just because a game is good it does not mean I will like it.  The components, graphics, production quality, rules and mechanics of this game are all above average to good.  The game even has a good degree of interaction in spite of being a "rummy" like tableau builder.  The theme is well represented in the mechanics, which simulate well some of the theories of the evolution of specialized traits and competition for scarce resources.  In spite of all of the above, I intensely disliked my first play of the game and do not wish to play it again.  It feels as though the game is mostly a "rummy like" MPS tableau builder with text based rule breaking/modifying cards, personal boards, and it feels as thought the decision space is limited and mostly driven by the random cards draw.  In other words, this is the kind of game where I feel the game plays me instead of me playing the game and where I feel disconnected and separate from the other players.  There are many other games that do this type of game better and this is also not the kind of experience I seek when playing boardgames with others.  Hence, objectively good game, subjectively undesirable.

Needs more traits to really embrace the evolutionary theme and possibly action cards representing evolutionary concepts (like punctuated equilibrium, genetic bottle-necks) and events (famine, plague, sudden climatic change).
However, it is an absolute ton of fun to play.  Strategic and deep yet really easy to teach.  Does an exceptionally elegant job of marrying the evolutionary theme to the game play by something as easy as food availability.  Art is beautiful!
Biggest plus of all:  my wife really likes the game!
My search for a good evolution themed game is over.  This one hits all the right notes and will undoubtedly only get better with a couple expansions.  Love it.

Initial rating after 2 plays.  There's a lot to this game that makes sense.  I'm looking forward to more plays--and to the Flight expansion.  Usually I don't enjoy games with so much direct conflict, but it makes thematic sense in Evolution; without carnivores there isn't enough food.  So, it's about picking traits that will give you the edge.  Yup, very thematic.

Edit on 6/14/2015:  With two more plays I gave the game a minor bump. (7.5 to 7.6) I think it's probably a better game than the rating might indicate, but I'm not particularly good at it yet.  My rating will probably increase with more plays.

Further edit: More plays and another bump in rating, now to a 7.8

Probably the best evolutionary themed game I have played so far. I had mixed feelings, the game play was good and requires some hard decision making. however, the range of abilities seems slightly limited and I am not sure there is a huge breadth of tactical opportunity so replay ability may not be great. However, I'd like to play again to get a better idea of it.

Fun game, beautiful artwork, interesting and unique theme.  I do feel like this game benefits quite a bit from the Climate Change expansion though.  After playing with the Climate Change expansion, I don't know that I could ever go back to the base game, the added traits and challenge of adapting to a changing climate adds a more varied and challenging game play.  I'd say that expansion takes this game up at least 1 star, maybe 2, so it's strongly recommended.  Base game: scores a 6.  With the Climate Change expansion: scores a 7 or 8.

A really good thematic card game in which you attempt to devour food from a central watering hole and bite chunks off of each others species. Just don't get too attached to the creatures you "evolve" in front of you as you are going to be a KFC for someone.

I have really enjoyed the dynamics of this game. Each round you play out your hand of cards in turn order, either discarding cards to increase the body size of species or their numerosity, or you play them face down as a trait (adaptive evolution) reacting to the other creatures traits and the general environment the game has created. So the size of a creature and how many of them there are is open information as the turn proceeds, but the evolving adaptations are not. All traits are revealed at the same time each turn after everyone has played out the cards they want. Then like a scene from "From Dusk Till Dawn" the feeding begins. Teeth rip apart flesh, blood and scraps fly everywhere to be scavenged in the shadows, creatures hide behind others and co-operate to survive the best they can. Some gently sit munching grass getting fat, and then when they have had enough, gently burrow a tunnel and climb in it to avoid the carnage above. Each to their own.

In the game your creature needs to be larger than someone else in order to to be a successful meat eating dribbling sharp-toothed carnivore so if a player starts pimping out the body size of their burrowing, fatty tissued-up herbivore and then lay down a new unseen trait you have a suspicion straight away they have turned to the dark side and are going to be looking to chomp down on your grass-eating legs pretty soon. That is unless you started the bulking out race by sending your meek long-necked burrowing giraffe like mouse to the animal gym bumping up your body size and they claim they are getting bigger to stop you from eating them, but hey, you don't see things that way. No, No, No, they are the threat, you are peaceful, what harm is a long necked mouse going to cause anyone? or so you convince everyone else around the table, before revealing that long neck has a head that has now developed incisor teeth for ripping apart their flesh ... Whoops sorry didn't realise exactly what that carnivore trait meant! It's a dog eat evolved dog with not enough defences kind of world.

Luckily there are many ways of defending yourself and there is nothing more joyous as watching the changing expression on a players face as they proudly reveal their wonderful new carnivorous beast only to realise they can't climb and have no intelligence and all the other beasts of the plain have started climbing things, rapidly, and are now way up high completely out of their reach. 

Just a great game and definitely a keeper. Looking forward to the climate expansion, although how many unplayed expansions do you need? The base game is that good.

RATING: 8.6
Lots of good interactions here, with important tactical decisions to be made each round.  Heavy enough to come back to again and again, but I think it'll be light enough to teach to others without much difficulty (not necessarily a gateway game, though; I'd say the rules put it more on par with Flash Point or 7 Wonders in terms of how much there is to teach).

We went through lots of playtesting iterations, and it seems like all the best decisions were made for the final version.  Exciting!

The theme and mechanics of this game are really well integrated. No mere chrome here. The different traits that your species can have bring logical and interesting consequences to how they interact with their environment (food sources) and the other species.

The mechanics are also beautifully simple yet the interactions among the players take unexpected turns. Highly recommended.

Played this at BGG Family Con 2015. There were 5 of us. I learned the game on the fly and didn't completely understand what was going on until about halfway through. I like it. It's not as unique as I thought it would be. The evolution tracks are essentially resource tracks, and the preparation for combat is like building up your armor and strength in games like Kingsburg. What I do enjoy is the theme and how it blends with these mechanisms. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
FUN: amazingly thematic for a cardgame on such a broad subject. Very interactive without becoming too mean.

UNIQUE: a good game about evolution that plays easily and fast.

NEGATIVES: might be a little mean for some. New players might feel lost the first time as they do not fully appreciate all the possible interactions between cards.

Call me crazy, but to me this game almost feels like Small World: The Cardgame when carnivores are around. Instead of fighting for territory on a map, you are fighting more abstractly to let your species grow in order to get points. You are also looking for good combinations to gain an edge over the other players.

A surprising amount of strategy involved.  GF has bouts of AP while playing this, as every card really counts here.  Will my opponent go carnivore next round?  Can I afford to dump this defense trait for something that will help me get more food?  How much food do I really want to put into the watering hole?

The caveat is that every round feels like a bit of the same.  Might be more interesting at higher player counts.

A good game.  Involving bluffing,  economy building (population to help consume large amounts of food), defence (body size) and some decent card combos.  Happy to play again, and reasonably quick rules.  Carnivore seems to be a weaker strategy - herbivore seems to be the way to go, with the odd carnivore card held in hand to pounce on newly created species.

Some concern regarding limited choices, and there is a certain randomness regarding what cards are available (I didn't get any cooperation cards for example).

Good:
The art and components are great.

It is entertaining building up several different species over the course of the game. 

When a predator hits the table it becomes a little tense because you don't want your friendly plant eaters to become food for the sharptooth.

Bad:
This game combines luck with knowledge of how to combo the cards. This results in a runaway leader problem once the more experienced player gets the right cards.

Note: CLIMATE makes this a much better game.

Things went wrong when we forgot some of the rules- not getting extra cards for more species, killing a species that couldn't be attacked (twice).  So left an aggravation, even tho we've played this before (we don't play often and this was husband's first time playing with me & kids).

A bit of an overpriced card game.  Wish there were more variation between species, but I imagine a flood of expansions are coming.  Don't like how large creatures can eat much, much smaller creatures and survive.  Would be nice if the environment had some sort of effect: a bit much intelligent design feel.  the designer has approached me on several occasions when I have expressed my opinion that this is an average game, at best, and has even tried to use the extremely flawed 'review' in Nature as a testament to its greatness.  Well, neither has been very convincing.  It just does not feel right in what it is trying to emulate, and I still think it is way overpriced.  If you want a good game on the topic, try American Megafauna or Bios: Megafauna, or even Ursuppe does a better job.

Evolution is about giving your animals traits so that they can dominate the other species around them. Those traits can allow you to eat other animals, defend with a hard shell, climb up a tree, etc. Fairly quick game that's silly fun but also has some good decisions around hand management and timing. Only worries at that perhaps some more dominant combos could make the game become to prescripted.

A thematic, tactical card game with beautiful art work that plays in an hour.

Limited play experience, but there are some very powerful card combos that you can build towards and/or draw if you are lucky.  

Not convinced that the game play is especially deep or strategic, but since I really like the theme and production values, that's enough for now, at least another game or two (or three).

Knowledge of cards available and possibilities is important for skillful play, but you can't control what you draw...

Enjoyable light game. Decisions are well balanced and must be made according to what the other players are doing. Too many carnivores will starve. Large plant eaters will score high if you discard good food cards. High body size raises your defense but also makes you a more attractive target.

Really, really high hopes for this one, but fairly disappointing first play. 2-player, and once one player got a pack-hunting carnivore, the game was basically over (though it lasted another 45 minutes). There was really no way to starve it (by trying to limit the available food - and not start new species), and just about impossible to avoid being its prey. Beautiful game. Great components (though the first player token is pretty over-the-top). Great theme/concept. Just not sure about the gameplay.

Számomra nagy meglepetés a magyar megjelenés, de ennek köszönhető, hogy beruháztam rá.
Gyönyörű a kivitelezés, és tematikus a játékmenet; tényleg küzdelem folyik az élelemért, és a fennmaradásért. Ellenben rendkívül egyszerűek a szabályok és a döntési helyzetek, ami nem baj, mert ezért gyorsan pörög a játék. Viszont könnyednek sem mondanám a kártyák tulajdonságai miatt, mert így elég sok mindenre kell figyelni, ami nehezítheti a játék elsajátítását. Számomra ez nem okozott gondot, ugyanakkor többféle kártya bőven elférne még, mert ez így hosszú távon nem elég változatos (nem szeretem ha egy játék csak kiegészítővel lesz újrajátszható). A több kártya miatt nehézségben eltolódna a komplexebb játékok felé, de ez nem baj (a Dicsőség Rómának! nagy kedvenc). Viszont így most se nem gémer játék, se nem családi.
De egy gyönyörű, egyedi témájú, érdekes társas, ami 6 fővel is játszható (és tök jól működik úgyis, ami hatalmas plusz!). Összességében egy hetesalá.

Evolution ist ein wirklich tolles Spiel, mit einem faszinierenden und einzigartigen Thema. In Evolution entwickeln die Spieler eigene (urzeitlichen) Tierarten, mit unterschiedlichen und individuellen Eigenschaften. Diese werden durch karten dargestellt, die man zu Beginn seines Zuges zieht. Nun muss man sich entscheiden, ob man die Fähigkeiten der einzelnen Karten nutzt, oder diese abwirft, um sich eine neue Spezies zu erschaffen, oder die Werte einer schon bestehenden Spezies zu steigern. Schlussendlich geht es nämlich um den Konkurrenzkampf um die zur Verfügung stehende Nahrung. Aber Achtung, denn vielleicht hat sich ein spieler auch eine fleischfressende Spezies erschaffen, die es auf das Leben der anderen Tierarten abgesehen hat. Evolution ist immer wieder spannend und flott erklärt und ebenso unkompliziert gespielt. Klasse!

Elsőre - és másodikra - nem igazán hatott meg a játék, nagyon laposnak, érdektelennek találtam. A 3. parti viszont nagyon érdekesre sikerült, szoros is lett a vége. A ragadozók a játék nagy részében alig csak, hogy nem pusztultak éhem, eközben a növényevők degeszre tömték magukat. :)
Nagyon érdekes kombókat sikerült felépíteni, muszáj volt folyamatosan figyelni a többiek fajait, tippelgetni a várható stratégiájukat és várni a megfelelő lapra. Igen, van benne szerencse, mint általában egy kártyajátékban ( mert ez egy kártyajáték igazából ugye), aki ezt elbírja viselni, annak egy remek kis játék lesz.

The art makes it. It is just superb. The game itself is very easy to learn and is made easier by a rulebook that is beautifully laid out and great to read. It's good fun trying to keep your creations at the top of the evolutionary food pyramid and trying to second-guess what your opponents will play. Needs a fair amount of table space, though the graphic design on the cards means that they can be overlapped once you know what they do and don't need to keep referring to their text. All the text on the cards is reproduced in the (stunningly gorgeous) player aids, but if you're short on table space those are probably also going to be put to the side.

Kinda cool how well the theme shows through in this simple and abstract game.  Basically you draw cards each round and either discard them to take actions (grow the size of your species/population, create another species) or play cards on a species to evolve them.  Everyone takes turns at the end of the round to feed by taking turns grabbing plant tokens at the watering hole - which can be scarce - or feeding on other species if your species evolved into a carnivore.  Lots of depth from an otherwise simple game.

RATING: 5
Rating as a game - 5.  Rating as a teaching tool - 9.  

Teaching Tool.  I've used this game as a teaching tool in an evolutionary psych class.  The purpose of the assignment is for students to become familiar with trait interactions, environmental stable systems / game theoretic thinking, and to consider how processes can be modeled.  The assignment begins with the students "critiquing" the game from the perspective of it being an accurate model of evolutionary processes.  The students are then required to play the game with limited sets of traits, while paying attention to "best" traits.  Finally, the students reskin the game using "psychological traits" and present their creations to the class.  Having done this assignment over two semesters, it seems to be something that the students respond well too, particularly the "re-skinning" aspect.  

Game. Now, I am referring here to the base game, and I have only played 2-player.  I have to say, I find the game unsatisfactory.  My main problem, I think, is that the game doesn't do anything well.  As a simple card game, I feel is lasts too long for what it is, and several of the traits don't have the specificity that I would expect in an intro / simple card game.  E.g., long neck and carnivore... is that simply and impossible combo?  What about forager and carnivore?  I also find that the game has a run away leader problem.  If a player gets a nice combo early (e.g., a cooperation chain mixed with forager and long neck), then that player is most likely going to win.  Sure, the length of the game helps mitigate this somewhat by giving an opponent time to attack that engine and build up one of their own... but this feels like a slog.  That is, a "Russian Front" of attrition.  I don't mind slogs or games of attrition, but they need some tension (e.g. Twilight Struggle or Star Wars Rebellion).  Here, the game just feels like a slog.  Finally, I feel like there is something of a disconnect between the various functions of the cards - discarding for feeding, discarding to increase body size, discarding to increase population.  That is, the discarding *decision* doesn't seem particularly stressful, in the way, say, that it is with Twilight Struggle.  Further, the thematic linkage of discarding cards (which are traits, after all) to speciate or trigger an increasing body size (which *should* be a trait) or to increase population (which should be a function of food acquisition), leaves me shaking my head.  All that said, I do find the game intriguing, but more because I want to like it more than I do.  I wish that the game specialized.  That is, I wish the game either became *more* of a party game (e.g., something like Machi Koro) OR specifically focused on some aspect of natural selection.  To me, the game *should* be about traits, in which case, the game should permit more complicated interactions...but then the game would no longer be family friendly, nor would I probably be able to use it as a teaching tool.

In this adaptation game, each player starts out with a species, with one population and one body size. You get dealt a hand of cards, and you can use the cards to increase population, increase body size, start a new species or give your existing species a trait, such as being a carnivore, getting more food, defence and so forth. Every turn, players secretly play a card out of their hand to seed the food in the middle, which can be large or small. Game ends when the deck runs out. 

It's a fairly simple game to play and understand. It's trying to predict what the other people will do in terms of turning into a carnivore that make it interesting. There are interesting choices to make and how to adapt your species. I am looking forward to more plays to get in a rhythm of how things change from round to round. 

In a game with 4 or more players, if one player turns out a carnivore, they potentially could put themselves in a kingmaking position. The carnivore doesn't generate enough points, but you can hurt a perceived leader. This would be my only criticism of the game, but otherwise I enjoy looking at the card combinations.

A very good, solid Eurogame about creating a species with various traits and competing to see who can eat the most.  The species have access to trait cards, which allow them to add special modifiers (becoming carnivores, gaining extra food, defensive bonuses, etc.), gain a new species, grow your population, or increase in body size.  Population and body-size are marked with cubes and since there are so many cubes, you have to think carefully about how you want to evolve your species.  Do you want a lot of small creatures who are weak but can take a lot of food?  Or do you opt to be an apex predator who does whatever he wants?  (My species went unchecked last game with a large population, body size, and carnivorous traits.  I ran away with it.)  

The game plays quickly and takes about an hour.  I'd say it is a medium weight game with plenty of replay value.  If you like the thought of creating a thriving species, I'd consider checking this game out.

RATING: 4
I generally had fun for the first half of each game, but in each game, one superspecies would arise and dominate the whole game for what turned out to be a too long and forgone conclusion.

I have read that this is because the base game includes cards which allows newer players to put more food into the watering hole than they should, but that is an oversight which requires multiple plays for some people to understand, especially since it isn't always clear what constitutes "too much food."

Since I have a pretty varied and changing game group, problems which always arise for new players are a barrier to enjoying the game for me, because I see them again and again.

That said, I DID have fun evolving my species and seeing the give and take of evolution when the game actually worked for my group.

The base game deserves just as high a rating as Climate because I view one as just a variation of the other. The base game reminds me of Tigris and Euphrates in depth in that I know it can support hundreds of plays and there will be something different each time. Dominic (the designer) has written a lot about the subtleties required to beat the really great players, and that kind of stuff just stokes the fire. I’ll gladly play either version anytime.

ORIGINAL: I’m really loving this. Dominic and his team have done an outstanding job in developing the game and putting out a high-quality product. The theme is awesome and really works, each game plays out differently, and there are lots to strategies to explore.

RATING: 6
Very elegant design, with equally elegant mechanisms and very simple rules that nonetheless will require some time (usually one game) to fully understand because the effect of each cards it's written on it.

The theme is quite well implemented, almost everything makes sense. The art is very good and the components are great.

With many (4+ players) the game becomes very random, it's impossible to defend against all of them and control is reduced drastically (your species can suffer greatly druing your offturn). It will also be easier to prey the winner and destroy him. 

My main issue is that some defenses are very difficult to overcome (ie: 2 species with Warning Call). It's not worth to attack those players and the rest of the opponents will prey on themselves, weakening them, while this well defended players will easily bad more and more points.

I need more plays to see if this is really an issue.

Overall, for me, it is a bit too long for such a random game.

Not a terrible game, but the "Carnivore" mechanic obligates players to attack each other -- not something I find enjoyable.  It can lead to kingmaker or runaway-loser situations.  For example, one player might not get the required defenses against a large carnivore and find they are the target of multiple attacks in one turn.  This happened to me and I politely finished the rest of the game knowing I'd be multiple points behind the other players, due to having a lot of my new species chomped into extinction.

I didn't think I could encounter a game that I would describe as TOO nasty, but bigods if Evolution doesn't come close. The targetted attacks work best in 2P games and with 3-4 this could easily evolve (pun intended) into fisticuffs. I really like everything that Evolution has presented, but it may prove too much for some.

I have really enjoyed this game. Its relatively simple but its still deep with strategy . The cards are simple enough but can be combined to form some pretty powerful combos. In this game I prefer defense over offense. To me at least in this game defense has the edge. You can also do a hybrid strategy. Where you use a few carnivores and a few herbivores. I have never won a game going strictly with carnivores though that doesn't seem possible with the type of defense cards they have in this game.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]For me Evolution: The Beginning solves all the issues I have with Evolution. For starters Evolution: The Beginning plays great with 2; this was a goal of the designer when creating the new game. Carnivores are also viable out of the gate in Evolution: The Beginning, based on the game mechanics I'd be surprised if you didn't develop a few carnivores over the course of a game. Most importantly even though there are less trait cards in Evolution: The Beginning I don't see that as a drawback (I found the variety of traits in Evolution to be lacking) because the game plays so fast and there is plenty of tension in deciding how to get the most out of your limited resources (cards) as you race towards victory.

Long story short (too late...) I prefer the streamlined design of Evolution: The Beginning over Evolution and therefore I have very little desire to play Evolution again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This was high on my want to play list, so I was happy when Drew offered to bring it to a meet up. My first play included the flight expansion, which in hindsight adds some much needed variety to the game play. After 3 plays I'm already finding the game to be severely limited in the amount of variety the evolution cards offer. 

In my opinion Evolution occupies the same game space as tableau builders like Race and Roll for the Galaxy, Elysium, Imperial Settlers and Deus yet is severely limited by a small set of species abilities. I understand that the combination of these abilities can change how the different species interact, but there are still only a handful of different ways to evolve your species. Also it is extremely hard to play a carnivore which my kids found really frustrating (even though they were eating me, it was only small bites so I was still raking in the points).. I was able to win 2 of the games I played while completely ignoring the carnivore strategy while my opponents were busy eating my dinosaurs, but unable to consume the same amount of food I was.

I think Evolution is a solid game and if asked I would play it again, but even with the Flight expansion this still isn't a game I want to own.[/i]

OK, so this is the game that would, had it been the first game we ever played, have put the stop to the collection in its infancy.  Wife hated it in initial plays.  (We played at least one carnivore rule VERY wrong, and so badly broke the game.) I was convinced she would enjoy it, if she'd give it a chance.  I think she's much more accepting of it now.  Very clever card game and I think it's a lot of fun to play.  I need to get it to the table with more than two people to see what it's like.

A much more evolved game than its predecessor. The game is drawing cards and then deciding which to discard for food, which has a power you won't find useful and maybe discard that to start a new animal, or build up the size of one of your existing animals, or do you really like the power and place it face up as a trait against one of your existing animals. Traits are either combo-y to get extra food as fast as possible, defensive, or offensive. There's little point building a nice combo to get food from the table if you ignore defence and get smacked about by some animal concentrating on offensive powers. A balance must be struck. Hopefully for the sake of the game, the offensive player(s) correctly targets the points leader - there's still an element of king-making in the game as a result, but much less than its predecessor. We enjoyed the game much more by deciding what our cards were going to do - boost size, population, trait, new species, etc - and then resolving them simultaneously rather than the potentially long-winded player-by-player process which could induce AP. With that approach, I didn't mind the combo-y nature of the game but I'm not sure how more there is to explore.

An interesting, intriguing, remarkable, and beautiful game. Many choices to make. Easy to learn; not easy to play well. Lots of strategies and combos to explore. we couldn't stop thinking about it after learning it.

Evolve your species to survive, and don't get too attached to them.

Not a great 2-player; Flight changes that a lot.

Not intuitive at first. AP alert.

Biggest disappointment in years. Bought into the hype, the look, the fun concept, and my wife loves animal games. She hated this. Half way through a much too long 2 player game, she says "this is boring. Was this made for five year olds?" 
I had to agree. Was this it? Eat and eat, very few choices, none of them interesting, too many random cards, repetitive. Lots of chrome, no game. Broken as a two player game. 40 card removal still not enough. Too easy to feed, most cards had high food values so food was always abundant, too easy to bring out more species, which soon filled the table, too hard to read all the various traits on all the animals to see if attack was possible or not. There were also many timing questions and card combo questions that implied 'strategy' and complexity but did nothing but detract from what I'd call 'Devolution', a very unevolved and uninvolving game. I make a carnivore, and she protects herself from it. Rinse and repeat. Games need to hook you immediately, not five games later, or they do not get played again. I don't even ask for ten plays. I want ONE fun game night, and I'm happy. If the game then sits in the shelf for two years, I don't care.  This game didn't even give us that. She asked "you paid $65 for this? That's absolutely ridiculous." I'm embarrassed, upset at hunting this down and going out of my way to buy it, and feel ripped off. 

We have never NOT finished a game. This was an unfortunate first. It's a $10 filler at best, way overpriced at $65 and would be better suited to young children. Considering I bought Capo Dei Capi for $10 last month, which provides so much more gameplay, and actually works for two players, it boggles the mind that this costs $65 CAD. More annoying is all this useless chrome takes precedence: huge Dino start piece, six tote bags, large watering hole. ????? It only jacks up the price and take up space.  This Dino has no clothes. It's a card game, and not even a good card game. 

Please, play online first and test before risking your hard earned money.

mixed feelings on first play. Second play confirmed the negative feelings.  I will not play this game again.  I do not find it fun, and feel like I am destined to be eaten.  To be successful at this game, you have to be able to recognize what others are going with their species (i.e. are they going carnivore on you?, or if you are going carnivore, will you be able to eat them?) and this requires being able to recognize what traits their species have as well as their body size and population, as well figuring out how to use your cards.  Without good mid-range vision to enable me to recognize traits, this game just does not work for me.

Evolution is a card game in which you try to build up the traits of one or more species so that they can eat the most food.  Most animals are herbivores, and eat from a limited supply of food tokens that are distributed player by player until they run out.  However, some traits let species eat more than one food at a time, or get food from outside the supply.  Some traits can turn species into carnivores, which eat other player's species instead of food from the common supply.  There are lots of traits that provide extra defense against carnivores, and other traits that help the carnivores get around these defensive traits.  It was an interesting game, but as a card game it's very dependent on luck of the draw, and the take-that elements might turn some gamers off.

Alright, after a few plays with a range of 2-4 players, and ironing out the kinks each play, I can say that this game is solid, albeit maybe a bit light and repetitive for my tastes. The artwork is amazing and the component quality is okay. The boards are warping a bit and the card quality is something that needs to be sleeved ASAP.

My biggest complaint about the game is the watering hole and food tokens blend in with each other. Complete pain in the ass sometimes. I think the card play is fun and can lead to some interesting combos. I feel like there needs to be more cards to keep it interesting for more than a dozen plays.

Overall, I'm impressed with the game, but I could see my rating dropping a point depending on how the next several games go.

If I want to teach people about hand management, this is the game I will use. And apart from that it also has a great interaction.

The game has some nice mechanics like "discarding" a card to determine the food that will be available for this round. Generally it's best to use all your cards, but sometimes you wanna get hold of one or more for different reasons. 

Then it's also very benificial to watch your opponents and see what they're doing. You might change tactics and evolve your animals to a greedy, coöperative, defensive, agressive species. Or a healthy mix. All in order to get the most food, cause species which are eating generate points. And getting eated loses you points, so beware of carnivores!

The game idea is really cool, but after a couple of turns it starts falling apart. Those  doing well at the start tend to stay on top, while those that fall behind just can't catch up. Also the feeding phase feels more like book-keeping rather than actually playing.

Fun game where you have to constantly change your strategy to get the food vs other players.  The setup and rules were decent to implement and I like all of the different ways one can go with their evolution traits.  

The game is timed by the deck, so games will be longer with more and quicker with less.  In our three player game, it seemed to go on a little longer as some rounds were repeats and we had too many species and traits out.

A very tactical card game in which you build and evolve your species by giving or modifying their traits. you are competing over food with other players which is basically the game's victory point. the twist is you can make your species carnivore which means you can attack other species and they count as your food. really enjoyable and ever changing game.

Did not expect to like it but did.  I do worry that certain combinations were so powerful in the game we saw that more than one player sought them out.

RATING: 4
Survival of the fittest is fine for nature, but it's not good game design. Carnivores have incentive to attack the weakest species, which sets that player back, which makes them weaker, which makes them get attacked more, etc.

There is a major runaway leader (and spiraling loser) problem in this game; in all three of my plays, there have been one or two people clearly in the lead and one or two people with half as many points as the leader. If you get one or two good defensive cards in your opening hand, you'll be OK; otherwise, prepare for a bad experience.

[i]I backed the Kickstarter for this, so if that biases my opinion, I apologize. [/i]

Evolution is a tableau-building card game, wherein each player is creating species in his tableau and granting them traits to offer protection, assist with feeding, or a number of other benefits. Meanwhile, other players are creating their own species. All of these will be competing for a limited common food supply. Well, until one of more of the species become carnivorous and then begin to eat one another. Points are scored by eating food, and are rewarded at the end of the game for living species and their traits.

The game is rather lighter than I thought it might be. There is certainly some strategy in setting up card combos to protect a species or eat food more efficiently, but it is very difficult to plan ahead as those choices are mostly determined from a rather small hand of cards each turn. There is a decent amount of player interaction through food competition and direct attacks on another player’s species. 

The game is well-produced (except for the cards - mine showed wear after a single play), and thematically interests me. For what it’s worth, my kids (9 and 7) both really took to it and have wanted to play repeatedly. It’s not something I’ll play all the time, but I do look forward to exploring it some more in the future.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit - more than I expected.

It is fun to see new species appear when the conditions on the board change. Still, the actual variety does seem a bit limited, and I am worried that it won't take much time to get tired of the limited set of cards. It could be that this is already solved by  [thing=176173][/thing].

It also seems that a player can be hurt a lot by an early [i]Carnivore[/i] if he doesn't get appropriate defense cards. I don't know how often this will happen, but it seems detrimental to the fun.

I'd also like it more if there was some more change in the environment (other than the rather volatile food supply). Perhaps I should try out [thing=182134][/thing] instead.

Ahogy a játék neve is mutatja, az evolúciót követhetjük nyomon pár új állatfaj alkalmazkodása, vagy éppen kihalása révén.
A lényeg, hogy létre tudunk hozni új fajokat és a kezünkben levő lapok kijátszása, eldobása révén növeljük a populáció számát, az egyedek méretét, vagy új tulajdonságot adhatunk neki (legfeljebb három lehet fajonként). Olyan fura "képződményeket" is alkothatunk, hogy pl. Brontosaurus, ami fára mászik és páncél borítja.
Létre hozhatunk ragadozókat is, de azok nem az itató körül felhalmozott élelemből (növényekből) táplálkoznak, hanem a növényevőkből falatoznak, rossz esetben megeszik őket.

Fairly simple, easy to teach but a wealth of elegant trait combos create fabulous depth. Mechanics enhance theme, which is educational, realistic and engrossing. Various successful strategies are viable, and yet deft tactical decisions must guide you to survive in a varied, chaning environment. Despite what some have been critical of, there is no one trumping strategy; each strategy has counter tactics if players are aware and a bit lucky with card draws to execute. Engine building card combo mechanics are balanced well against resource scarcity and need for survival; most engine building games end about the time you are really at max production (only growth is experienced), but most games of Evolution end after there has been some peak/crash with the available food. It's a great dynamic not found in many (any?) engine building games.

-The game is a bit more cutthroat than we usually like (but that also speaks to how much we like the gameplay and how it overcomes this drawback). Most games there is ebb and flow, or cat-and-mouse action that keep the experience engaging and fun. However, once in a while a player is able to really bully and dominate a game, which can leave a sour taste in everyone's mouth.
2 player experience not as satisfying getting to use 1 less trait and more lopsided results

In terms of games about evolution, I think this is my favorite one yet. It plays simply and has some nice interaction between players, in terms of the order at which you draft the food from the middle, and in terms of carnivores attacking each other. The combat system uses a sort of complex rock/paper/scissors system of determining legal targets which is just enough to be interesting without being too basic or too frustrating. Points are kept secret in this game, which means with more players it's harder to keep track of which players to focus on. In terms of complexity, some of the card interactions puts this slightly above gateway game, but quite a bit below brain burner.

Better than I thought it would be, honestly.  Kind of fiddly at times (particularly when handing out new species), and the rules really need a FAQ or a few examples, but it is fun, fairly simple to teach, and beautifully illustrated.  
Can imagine it would become kind of routine after multiple plays, though, since there seems to be a few trait combinations that are VASTLY overpowered.  Overall, not awful.

Love the player interaction in this, while mostly indirect, if you don't react and adapt to your opponents evolutions, you will most likely have a bad time. I played it with my girlfriend, and there were many stand off scenarios where we were both like "what are you up to! what's that new trait card you're about to play?!". I had a lot of fun and would definitely recommend this game.

This game is one that intrigues people, and that intrigue is borne out in gameplay.  As you evolve and add new species, super powered combinations became easy prey to new traits, and it's easy (at least for me) to have your most successful oldest species suddenly be consumed due to my overconfidence.  The traits are thematic and fun, and there's fun table talk around good combinations and biology as the game goes on. The game also strikes me as relatively balanced, as long as someone has a carnivore out.  All that said, while the rules are pretty uncomplicated, they aren't quite intuitive (I have to contribute food to the feeding hole?).  In a way that makes those confusions more frustrating, as how other parts of the game - such as how the traits work - are very intuitive.  That said it's a very thematic and fun game that's been a fun play through with different groups.

A fun strategic card game with a lot of interaction.

I like how open-ended the choices are, where you can spend your cards to make food, create new species, increase your species' stats, or add traits to your species. It can make fun emergent narratives over the course of the game too.

I wish there was a bit more luck mitigation in the game, with some way to purchase a trait card that you really want. It also seems like the card interactions are fairly simple and not very numerous, so the game could get very samey fairly quickly.

8 - I rather enjoyed this, the game play has some subtle strategies like pushing out to get extra species early to get card advantage or blocking carnivores with the right traits.  The best part of the game is the untold story of the animals you create, with three simple traits you end up with drastically different species from all over the world and figuring out what animal fits those is fun.

Very good game that weaves a unique animal survival theme into hand management and card play mechanisms. Keeping all of your species alive and well is challenging. You have to keep them fed, grow the population, and make their body sizes bigger. Becoming a carnivore throws a nice twist into the game as well. A lot of what you do depends on what everyone else does in the game.

Evolution is a game where you build arbitrary species, eat arbitary food, and use arbitary traits to improve your status of each species on two arbitrary tracks.

Let me start over.

Evolution is a game where you spend cards to build species that can eat from multiple food sources, and can use traits to improve their population and body sizes, allowing you to eat more food/eat larger food for more VP.

I like how the theme shows through the game. Basically it is card management, selecting cards to determine how much food to put in the common bank, start and grow grow species, or add traits to a species. Most species remain herbivores, but on trait makes it a carnivore. The other traits help species grow faster, get food earlier, defensive against carnivores, or a counter for the carnivores. 
Having a carnivore is challenging, you need you need traits and size to get around the other defenses. For the herbivores the limiting factor is food supply not enough your population starves and the effort you've put in lost. However, since the victory points are factor of the food consumed along the way writing off a species that has played out may not be so bad.
The card art work is nice and adds to the game.
It is a card game so it is dependent on the luck of the draw. Your plans have to be flexible depending on what traits you are drafting.

I can't deny that this is a good, well designed game. But it's not for us. We don't enjoy games with large numbers of unique cards that interact in multiple long-term ways.  I know it's a very popular game mechanism - and Evolution executes it beautifully - but it fails (for us) in many of the same ways deck builders do.

Great game. Highly interactive. I love how these little systems fit together so well. Fantastic trait combos to explore. What I love is there is no guaranteed winning combo of traits. It all depends on what's happening in the simulated ecosystem created by the players.  What other players species trait combos are out, what they play and the amount of food available really forces you to adapt quickly. I love the colorful watercolor art.  The art in this game is very unique.  It's a shame the food tokens become camouflaged in the watering hole.  I've been using the back of the watering hole as a result. I wish the card stock was of better quality. Minor quibbles about probably the best game of 2014.

The card play and strategy is all very interesting, but you quickly discover that some combos are just way better than others, and being able to pull off those combos relies heavily on luck of the draw.  Still, it is fun to see what kinds of creatures people create, and some small amount of player interaction can introduce some variety into the mix. overall, it felt a bit shallow.

Theme – 4/5. Yay Evolution. Creating a species or group of species to survive forever. The Biology major in me doesn’t agree with parts of it, but generally it’s amazingly on theme and made to work.

Complexity – 4/5. Not hard to explain, the turns are laid out really well and you do the same thing every time. There aren’t a whole lot of cards, so it’s not really hard to catch on really quickly.  

Length – 3/5. Slight problem in that turns can either take a long ass time or are done in a heartbeat. Also the relatively short nature of the game (and it goes by pretty quickly) may feel a bit underwhelming when you have to pack it up. It doesn’t really feel like you accomplished a whole lot with your species when you wrap up.

Fun – 3/5. It’s a cool game, but you’re really just grab bagging stuff and going on auto-pilot. The only real decisions you have to make are less involving other people and more just the board state and optimizing what you are trying to get 

Replay-ability – 3/5. It’s cool, but the limited amount of cards that make its complexity low also make its replay-ability lower as well. You can only see pack tactics overcoming herding so many times before you kind of get bored with it.

Production Value – 4.5/5. Other than the small brown squares that you use to mark everything, the game is gorgeously rendered. I wish there was a bit more art, though I understand why there isn’t. The pieces are sturdy, not super easy to lose and just in general it’s a super well-made game that I expect to last me.

3.5/5. This is NOT a bad game. It is fun, interesting, and pretty well thought out. It just really is lacking a lot of substance in my opinion and while I ADORE the theme, I can’t see myself grabbing for this at every board game party, which is unfortunate because I really am quite a fan. I just feel like it really got to a point where it could have been extended, then they just stopped. Simplistic is good, but not in a game where you’re supposed to be making species interesting and individual.

Bonus: Customization – 2/5. Not a whole lot you can do except add bonus cards. It's possible and looks interesting, just would require extensive balancing.

Evolution feels a bit like a streamlined (and card game) version of Ursuppe (Primordial Soup). It plays much faster and is more dynamic, as you adapt quicker to your opponents races (especially, if there are one or two carnivores). Of course, you are more dependent on luck (card draws) than in Ursuppe, but I do not mind this too much because of Evolution's shorte game length.

RATING: 7.5
Firstly, the game art is gorgeous and I really wanted to love this game.  However, it was only so-so.  Seems to have an interesting take on evolution and species development but we kept stumbling over the card rules which made the game very frustrating at first.  Understanding that carnivores play a huge roll in the game and how it works is critical and also brutal. This made the game really cutthroat and can make bad blood in the game.  However, after playing a while one can actually create a symbiotic ecosystem where your own carnivores feast on your herbivores.  So my rating is system fluid with this one as rules clarifications and various path of victory need to be explored because as it is now is seem like the game is very same-y and will grow dull.

A simple fast game with interesting design. Players play cards to increase the size or population of their species or given them adaptive advantages.

Evolution sure is a game. It has cards and tokens and pieces so it must be a game. I knew nothing about Evolution going in beyond the cover art and a vague notion of the theme. Loving nature and animals and knowing it was well-regarded was enough for me to take a chance on it. Then I played it and thought "that's it?". Then I played it again and thought "I made very few actual choices". Each time I play I like the game less - the beautiful art is wasted and falls by the wayside in the face of dull and transparent mechanics that rise to the top. I continue to read reviews and opinions to see if maybe I've missed something but months later it still sounds like I'm playing the same game everyone else is. Probably not the game for me, but I'll keep trying occasionally because man, do I ever want to like this game.

Carnivores may ruin the game for herbivores. If you play with the one and only predator - it will eventually win. This game has gorgeous components and cool artwork, but the gameplay is too simple.

This beautifully-themed and visually appealing game is a great example of how to generate depth without complexity.

Pretty boring - there's a good bit of downtime, and I just didn't find much interesting in the game.  It feels quite a bit like Primordial Soup, but without any of the funny traits or spatial dynamics - I would always recommend PS over this game.  I like how in Primordial Soup you can still try to run away from a stronger, attacking player. And there seems to be at least one perfect set-up in the base game - Symbiosis-Cooperation-Long Neck on each species, with a increasing body size from left to right - that way you're impervious to all carnivores unless they have intelligence, and bid low on food pool since you're taking most of your food from the bank (6 per turn for 3 species).   Still in search for a game that really depicts evolution in any meaningful way - I really need to try Bios Megafauna one of these days.

I enjoyed a lot of the mechanics in the game; my only concern that it seemed a bit overbalanced.  However, this could have been because we were being too "nice" and food was too plentiful.

Played this in Essen 2015. There was fun ... and I think I would pick it up when I see a cheap possibility to get it, but all in all it did not convince me completely. It's a card driven above average game ... not more.

EDIT: Increased my rating from 7.0 to 7.7 because I can see much more flesh after my second play. As the game continues you develop more and more the feeling that you are really part of an evolutionary process. Imagining your species growing, increasing in population or adjusting to new conditions is a fun aspect of the game and adds more theme to it. You can even react on opponent's changes within their species. Above all the easy rules and the fast gameplay let this game deserve a high rating.

In my one game, the best options seemed obvious based on what I had in my hand.  It was just a matter of playing them (high defense + a way to get some food quickly).  I was quickly ahead.  Going carnivore seemed like a bad idea in general which was a bit disappointing.  This might be better with more playthroughs, but I didn't really enjoy it enough to give it a second chance.

I'd prefer more unique abilities than copies of the same skills. It's a better game in theory than in practice. The reality is that the game just doesn't have enough variation for me. (Although it doesn't help that my German edition has three fewer carnivore trait cards than the English edition.) There's a nice balancing act between improving your species with better skills, or size or population, or branching out into a new species. Simple, yet intriguing. Just not enough variation in the base game to keep it interesting for long. It's also hard to work out when we'll be left with a definitive version - the game is evolving into something better, but it also leaves me with the feeling that with my old set I'm always missing out on something better.

After another play of the game and some reflection, I think I have a good idea why I'm starting to dislike it more. It not only gives players the wrong idea of how evolution works (i.e. it somehow has a 'will' and/or 'strategy'), it sort of encourages, possibly sub/unconsciously, the idea of intelligent design.
I have a quite agnostic approach to life, but the fact of the matter is, if there is a theory that is proven to fit the evidence, up against another theory that has no evidence to prove it but has no evidence to prove its invalidity, the theory which has proof should be taken as canon. 

Its an interesting study to see the natural in-game development of trait-shifting, and i'm sure I'm missing something that educators see in this game. But overall, I'm quite wary about possible implied myths about evolution that many people already accepts as truth that the game gives. 
As a game-game though, its perfectly ok but there isn't much that grabs me to want to ever want to suggest it.

Had a lot of fun the first game, especially watching my son develop a very efficient feeding machine ecosystem of cooperative and foraging species. He may have won if he had layed negative food the last turn and not a high number. His first feeding cycle he got 5 food with fat burner, foraging, cooperative.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Wow, what a great game. Northstar hit it out of the park with a fully fledged leap from party games to Serious (tm) euro game.

The rules are simple (decide how to use your cards to grow your species, then make sure they can all eat each turn) but the combination of different abilities, how they interact with each other, and keeping an eye on how your competition is evolving, results in a Darwinian test of fitness on the road to victory.

We played it once and then immediately wanted to play it again to explore different strategies. The strategy isn't just limited to which abilities you choose, either; this is also a hand management game in which you have to make tough choices on how to spend your cards, when to add more species, or bide your time and build up a big hand, etc.

Love this game. I think the family is getting it for me for Christmas, woot!

It needs a few playthroughs to puzzle out the valid strategies and how to counter them so no one is steamrolled, but once you do, you'll have a fine time. A very friendly game for those who like experimentation.

The game gets hard to track with 5+ players. 3-4 seems to be the sweet spot.

Hint: If you have bad luck with the cards, discarding for body size is a very, very good alternative.

A játékosok különböző tulajdonságokkal rendelkező állatfajokat alkotnak a játék során. Ezek vagy békés növényevők, akik egymás elől eszegetik el az itatóba került ételt vagy ragadozók, akik más fajokból akarnak csipegetni. A játék alapvetően családi, de mélyebb annál. Jól kell megérezni mikor érdemes ragadozóvá válni, illetve megvédeni magunkat az ellenfél ragadozóitól. A játék nem hosszú és elég változatos lehet egy-egy parti. A ragadozás miatt van benne némi királycsinálás és a lapok véletlenszerű húzása miatt szerencse is, de kellemes játék mindenképpen.

Evolution is a tight, card-driven game that features a lot of interaction, and a ton of replayability. It is fun and fascinating to puzzle out the best use for your cards, and to build your invincible (nearly) dinosaur horde.

After teaching 25+ games, I can say this is the best tactical card game I have ever played. It is at once easy to PLAY, but the amount of DEPTH that emerges from the different combinations of traits and the unique environment created by the players at the table is mind-blowing. I find it so interesting that there is no best combination of cards to use, only the best-suited for the current environment, which changes each and every turn. Anticipating these changes and adapting your species to the ever-changing game state (and even influencing the game-state yourself) is extremely satisfying, one I don't expect to ever get old. 

I only wish it were easier to demonstrate the depth this game has to offer to new players. Inevitably, your first game is rough against experienced players because it is difficult to see the impact each decision has without experiencing the penalty, usually in the form of extinction (which can sting and leave a bad impression. Circle of life!)

Missed the Kickstart on this game, but finally got my hands on it this week after it being sold out from the original distro.

This game was so much fun the first time we played that we immediately reset the game and played again.  We had so many laughs the second game, that my girl was late for work.

Great game, well designed, and all of the trait combos we put together seemed realistic to some creature that has or does exist.

We have only tried the game with 2 players so far, but have had 8 species playing at once.  I have no doubt the game will function just fine with more players and still be equally as fun.

The art work in the game is amazing.  Lots of vibrant colors and great drawings.

The rules are easy to understand, which makes the game play fun but not too elementary.

The construction of the board, trait cards, and species board are very sturdy and the game as a whole as well as the box seem like they will be very durable.

All in all we love this game, and we look forward to many more laughs.  Seeing my girlfriend's glee when her carnivore ate my species was worth every penny of the game.  lol  It's the little things that count during table top gaming I guess.

I really want to like this game more. The theme is great, and you definitely feel like your creatures a different and for those that last more than a couple of rounds, you get attached to them. Still, the food management is pretty abstract and you really have to reign powerful carnivores, or otherwise they'll devour everything. I'd like to play this again to see if I really believe that my choices are super limited or if it was just that I haven't had much experience playing it.

UPDATE: I've played it again, but we misplayed the handling of carnivore food, so I have to try one more time before settling a true rating.

A fantastic game with plenty of depth. What I found absolutely fantastic about it is that no matter what you draw, you always feel you have options and decisions to make and never feel like the cards screwed you. There is always a way to use the cards you draw to gather more food than your opponents and build the most successful ecosystem. 

Gave the game a 8 for a start but it moved up a notch as it has been very successful with every group I played with. Simply put: an extremely fun, solid game.

This is a cool little card game! You are dealt a bunch of cards each turn, which you can use to power actions like starting a new species, giving species traits, improving their size and population. Traits can be a variety of fun things like carnivore (eat other species!), camouflage (predators can't see you to attack), etc. Then, you go around taking food cubes one by one from a central pool (or eating other species). Populations decrease if you didn't collect enough food. All surviving species, though, score the food as VP. Play your way through the deck, then earn additional VP for your final species' populations and traits.

This is not at all like their usual party games (which are very good, of course). Instead, it's kind of a thinky, quick-playing card game. Quite fun!

This is a re-implementation of Evolution: The Origin of Species.  Players are each playing a species of animals and evolving them with cards that give them different traits while struggling to keep them all fed.  I didn't care for that game much at all but this one does a lot to fix the biggest problems of that game.

First of all, random dice rolls determining the amount of food in the watering hole has been replaced with players playing cards showing how much food they wish to place.  This is a great change as players not only have more control but it also forces them to acknowledge the opportunity cost of which card they cannot play as a trait each round.  Also, carnivores have been re-balanced.  I felt they were oppressively powerful in the original design and now have seen them both ineffective and extremely dangerous if played right.  I love the additions of population to keep a species out even after being eaten and body size as an inherent way to protect your species from carnivores, both also do a lot towards balancing carnivores from the original.  Finally, it is altogether just a lot cleaner.  You can still play each card in multiple ways.  As a trait, food, new species, or increase of population or body size but no longer have to deal with flipping the cards around and the increase of food cost has been replaced with a simple 3-trait limit on each species.  Also, the artwork is gorgeous and evocative.

The game really hits that sweet spot of theme and mechanics as well as simplicity and depth.  It's awesome to imagine what kind of creature you are creating with the provided traits and the game even comes with a grid to help you name your creature based on its triats.  It is also a game you can teach to almost anybody, the same deck of cards is used for pretty much everything and it all works really smoothly together.

All of this while providing a wealth of decisions and depth of mechanics.  I love the mechanic of having the same card provide multiple different effects.  It forces you to always consider the opportunity cost when you play the card for one purpose over another.  There is strategy to be found in every action.  Do you put more food in the watering hole or try to starve out other species.  Your strategy can even change considerably based on turn order.  First place can be important because you get the most number of shots at food and especially as a carnivore can eat another species before it can get to you.  While in last place when taking actions you get to alter your decisions based on what the players ahead of you do.

I do think it has a rich-get-richer problem.  It does its best to alleviate this by rewarding dead species with card draw of that species trait cards but still I feel like once you get ahead in this game it is hard to be unseated.

Get cards have to manage food supply, traits, population, body size.  A carnivore is risky if you can't eat others however a herbivore has to rely on the food supply of the other players and has to also prevent itself from getting eaten. There are certain card combinations that can make a player way stronger than the rest of the group. Can also create a new species but that species has to then compete for food as well.

Everything in this game screams I should love this game with the concept, art and traits but I found the game too brutal for my liking. As a carnivore, you suffer the usual problem of trying too understand what the other players cards are to see if you can eat them which slows the game down and there is a learning curve needed to understand the traits to mitigate exposure to said carnivores. I also found the gameplay limiting, you are essentially choosing to be a carnivore or a plant eater and the dynamic on this is the various traits. I also found that in order to survive, body size is a no brainer unless you get the right trait cards, which is typical luck of the draw with any card game. I wouldn't say no to trying it out again but I won't lose any sleep if I don't.

Played this game at my last board game night and overall it is good.  Building new species and trying to survive and compete against the other species is a fun mechanic.  There is a good amount of strategy to this game once you realize how the cards and species building works.  I will say however that some of the cards seem overpowered when combined with other cards, making it very difficult to counter.  Hard Shell on a carnivore for instance is one such OP combination.  Considering the game relies on random card draws you could easily not be able to counter that situation.  Looking forward to playing the expansion.

This game didn't sound like my thing. And I hadn't heard great things about [thing=71021]the original[/thing]. But I have to admit: this is a pretty decent game.
There certainly is some take that but it didn't bother me too much. And you can find ways to protect yourself against that.
I enjoyed playing this, especially since it doesn't go on for too long, but it's not something I need to own.

I have a longstanding rule against games that were on Kickstarter - I'm sick of underdeveloped rules and game-breaking combos that the design team never thought of masked by pretty artwork and fancy extras.

Thankfully, I'm familiar with the design and development work that North Star Games put into each of their releases - that abilty to simplify and simplify whilst still leaving interesting decisions in games, along with their thorough playtesting.

And Evolution works brilliantly well; the game is simple to explain (Dominic is a master at writing rules), plays quickly but is full of decisions and interaction. An all-round excellent release.

It's still guilty of having too much art though; the watering hole is infinitely more useable if you flip it over and have the blank side in use. :)

I think this game is alright.  Some of the card combos is kind of neat, and you have to pay attention around the table avoiding whoever is out there and seeing what they do with their species.  Are some of the combos too powerful?  I don't know, after only a couple of games, I've seen different things be different powers over time.

RATING: 7
The game takes on the evolution theme ala Dominant Species, but does it in a much more streamlined, thematic way. Your species truly evolve and can totally change (like from a vegetarian to a carnivore) to take advantage of the ecosystem. Unlike dominant species, you can teach the game in about 5 minutes and play your first game in an hour. It has that ideal balance of easy to learn, yet still strategic.

Ultimately it's a resource management game and has kind of a euro feel, but there is also direct player interaction. If you play the carnivore trait on one of your species, you can attack that species. But, you have to meet a lot of requirements like being larger in body size and you have to overcome any defensive traits they have. So a successful carnivore can easily feed while wiping out other species. But if they all build up defenses you can't adapt to, your species can go extinct in the blink of an eye. Also, the amount of plant food is variable and dictated by the players, so some turns there will be very little food available and only the strongest will survive. Definitely the best evolution themed game out there. I see no reason to ever play Dominant Species again. Rating might be a little deflated because I just played the game 6 times in the last 24 hours and I'm a little burned out on it.

A really great game with a great concept, lets itself down a little with some vagueness in the rules, meaning you have to house-rule on certain elements (ie. can you discard 2 cards to ignore 2 traits if you have intelligence?). But generally very positive

RATING: 9
I'm a "the more complex the better" guy with board games, but this game stands in defiant exception to the rule. The game is simple, explaining it to rookies can be a hurdle but it's very straightforward once it clicks. All complexity is in card interaction, clearly printed in full (no glossaries needed for symbols or keywords). And yet something about the game just makes it wildly satisfying. For added fun, define your critters... Their journey is so much more fun when you qualify that your Mass 2 high pop Fat tissue defense herd critters were Guinea pig swarms, who over time grew massive and developed symbiotic relationship with your burrowing storks before suddenly eating them as they became carnivores. My only warning is that the game is VERY different with just two players, so make it a priority when you have groups. Both Flight and Climate expansions Are fun, but not must haves.

2-6 players.

Create "creatures" by assigning them up to 3 traits, long necks to get guaranteed food, faster breeding to increase the population and get more food. Whoever has eaten the most food across all their owned species at the end wins.
But also.... someone might make a carnivore species! And then all the other players have to balance self defense and food gathering. Almost as if they were... adapting?

The game plays very thematically, as everyone's species adapt to the environment. It is interesting to see how the ratio of carnivores and herbivores affect the available food. Sometimes it is a race to escape while other times it becomes a competition for food. Clever combinations are always a possibility, even with a small set of cards to work with. It takes the right crowd (those who aren't afraid of some "take that"), but when it is there this game really shines!

RATING: 7.5
What a fun game! The theme is cool and it REALLY comes through. While Dominant Species is a very different game, I feel that Evolution captures the theme a bit better. The actions of the other species greatly affect the ability of your own survival, so you need to evolve, quickly. Trying to predict the evolution of your opponents and be one step ahead is so fun. I felt like I was the species on the board, fighting to survive. The player aides are phenomenal, and the species naming guide is just great. I really like this game. 

Edit: I am really disappointed in the release of the second edition, so soon after the first. With the card changes it makes me feel like my game is obsolete. I should still enjoy the first version, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Evolution is a card game all about feeding your species. There's a limited pool of food resources (at least in theory, if not in our game) and competition to eat as much as you can. The winner is the player with the most: consumed food, population and evolved traits.

You start with a species and every round you draw 3 cards plus an extra card for every species you control. Every player plays a card to the center, which will determine how much plant food will be available in that round. Players play cards to evolve their species, start new species, or grow their existing species in either body size or population. Then in player order, players feed a species with whatever food they can find.

A species can eat food equal to their population, but if they fall short their population will starve down to whatever level was fed. Many of the traits are related to getting food. But there's also traits that let you become a carnivore, which allows you to feed off other players. If a carnivore is larger than you, they can eat one of your population, which gives them food equal to your body size. And there's a lot of traits that allow you to defend yourself against predators, but also cards that let them ignore your defenses.

I didn't play this game particularly well, and completely missed that body size was as important as it was. So I wasn't prepared at all when carnivores suddenly appeared. About halfway through the game I realized that I was just barely eking by and that the game was over for me. There wasn't much I could do at that point but wait for the game to finish.

It was pretty frustrating that we were playing a game with a lot of food on the board, and that I never saw the cards that worked well with a lot of food (foraging, fertile). I did finally get a foraging card, but was only able to use it once, and I never saw a fertile card at all. I mostly saw warning call, ambush, intelligence, carnivore, and hard shell. Once or twice I saw other cards like foraging or unstable DNA, but it didn't really make sense to play them when I got them. So on top of not playing well, the game hates me too.

I kind of want to like this game, but not getting to see many different cards left a really bad first impression.

About [thing=155703][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=155703][/thing] is an strategic game that has hand management as main mechanic. It puts players in charge of creating and evolving species in order to feed and survive better.

[thing=155703][/thing] has a high amount of indirect and direct interaction. The indirect comes from every Herbivore mostly fighting for the same, and limited, amount of available food. The direct is attacking the species of other with Carnivores, which feeds them and lower the population of the attacked species.

There are several paths to follow and combos to be made, both inside the same species as well as with others. Decisions are, normally, not hard to be made, but are important, driving your options: your ability to eat, to resist attacks, to attack, etc.

Replay value is high: the random order and distribution of cards guarantee that the plays will follow different directions, not only in species created, but also in the availability of food, the interactions and timming.

The production value is good: the drawbags and player boards are neat, the tokens, board and cards are OK and it comes with an awesome first player token.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Each player starts with a specie with 1 Population and 1 Body, and 4 cards. At the start of each round the player chooses one card from her hand to add to the pool of food that will be available (cards have numbers that says how mch food it will add - some have negative numbers). Cards can be used to:
- Add traits to a specie;
- Increase Population of a specie;
- Increase the Body of a specie;
- Start a new specie (which will begin without traits, and with 1 Population and 1 Body).

Cards can be kept in hand for later rounds. Once everyone has used the cards they want in the way they want, comes the Feeding phase. The cards added at the start of the round will be revealed and the total amount of food will be tallied. Then, starting with the first player, food can be gathered (for Herbivores) or hunted (for Carnivores). Herbivores take food from the pool of food created by the cards, while Carnivores hunt other species and its food comes from the bank (don't affect the central pool directly, but, by lowering the population of other species, it has an indirect effect).

Both Herbivores as well as Carnivores can normally only eat until the food amount reaches the number of Population of the specie. Carnivores can only attack species that have a smaller Body, even if this means attacking a specie owned by the same player that has the Carnivore. Only one specie of the player can attack or take food from the pool, then the feeding turn passes to the next player.

There are, as expected, traits that help gather more food (from the bank, like Long Neck, more from from the pool, like Foraging, etc), others that help protect from Carnivores, others to enchance the ability to hunt, and so on.

Food from the pool that isn't eaten stays for the next Feeding phase. When every has finish eating or there isn't more available food (be to take or to hunt), feeding is over. If a specie wasn't able to feed enough to reach their Population size, it loses population until the amount of food it was able to get.

Players take the food gathered and put them in the bag - they will count as points, at the end of the game.

The round is over. In the new round players will receive 4 cards plus 1 for each specie above 1 the player controls. Play phase continues the same, until the draw deck is empty, then the last round will begin. Once it is over, players will count all the food they gathered - each will be worth 1 point. Also, players will gain 1 point for each trait on the species they have, plus 1 point for each point of Population on the species they have.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
The main one: how to use the cards you are dealt. This is valid from the start of the round (which card to add to the food pool) to the play phase - not only to select which Traits will work better with your specie, considering what the others have and what you want, but also to spend cards to increase Population (to gather more food: meaning more points), Body (to defend against Carnivores) and/or to start a new specie (if kept alive, will earn you more cards and increase the cap of the amount of food/points you can get per round).

These use of cards doesn't tend to be much difficulty - there are many you don't want (making it easier to discard) others that maybe are too important, and will be used as traits as soon as you see them. Yet, considering that the traits stay on the table and the increase in Population and Body are permanent (Population can decrease due to hunger or by being hunted), the choices carry weight for later rounds.

The other decisions that can happen often is which specie to feed first and which to attack if you have a Carnivore. Is possible that not all species will be able to feed, and extinction can, indeed, happen, not only due to hunger but also due to attacks of Carnivores, meaning that being able to keep a health amount of Population is very important, not only to being able to take more food (points), but to keep the specie around. On the other hand, this is why deciding which specie to attack is important, both to hurt someone that is doing too well and as a bargain chip if there are other Carnivores around.

Overall, decisions matter and have consequences, but aren't overly complicated nor too difficult.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Production value: the art if neat, the components are nice, everything looks great on the table, specially the first player token;
- High replay value;
- Theme has a strong presence;
- Offers constant decision making;
- Different paths to follow to victory;
- High amount of interaction, both indirect and direct.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Luck has a strong presence, due to the random draw of cards, normally something unwanted in a strategy game;
- Has strategy, but tatical decisions matter more;
- Being able to attack with Carnivores can both lead to some bashing the leader and, worst, to attack players already behind, inducing to a vicious cycle;
- Some cards seems much better than others.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
In a very thematic enviroment: the game does create a microcosmos of Nature, in which food is coveted, hunters pray on the weak (and meaty), and evolution makes species better in surviving and grow - be to take more and/or being able to protect themselves, directly or with the help of others. This is truly an achievement, specially for a card game with a few tokens and cubes.

I was excited to play [thing=155703][/thing], as it seemed to fit my bill almost perfectly: theme, reasonable playing time, options and decisions mixed in a not too heavy form. But my first play was lackluster: I was attacked before being able to make my game really start, and this, coupled with some bad decisions, meant I felt like I was just rolling with the punches, not truly playing, instead I was just there - some more attacks meant I was near last when the game finished - the position wasn't an issue, if I at least felt I gave a good try. I didn't.

Then I played again and the experience was better: less players (from 5 to 3) in a more friendly enviroment (as things went, I had the only Carnivore for most of the game), I could develop my tableau, seeing and using more options provided by the game. I still lost, however, I did played.

Games that allow direct attack can have these issues: read the game state is important, but, sometimes, due to protections, is possible to be attacked even when the person doesn't want to do this against you: is simply the biological imperative survival. You better grow a hide and horns, or you won't be able to handle [thing=155703][/thing]: this is my warning call.

In the end, [thing=155703][/thing] gives a nice thematic experience, a good set of decisions and a high level of interaction, all put in a pretty package and a almost short playing time. [thing=155703][/thing] won't work for everyone, mostly due the random aspects and attacks, but can be a good option for those looking for a medium weight tatical game.

When you open the box the first time, you see a huge pile of different tokens and a huge deck of different evolutionary traits, and you think it's going to be a complex, heavy experience. What you actually get is a tense, quick-flowing game of highly thematic and easily grokkable special abilities, with a thin balance of "everything's pretty much okay" until you get a carnivore, then everything goes out the window! The amount you have to balance defensive traits and the population growth that enables scoring is fascinating.

wait for 2nd ed fr northstar games in q3 2015. chameleon dude cover.  also 2nd ed has the yellow fertile card on the back.  vs. green on 1st ed.

finally played:  LOVE the theme.  think i loved the gameplay.  certainly a nasty game, but there seems to be some ebb/flow and you can maybe evolve away from predators.  not sure if predators will be 'broken' (aka too dominant) in my view.  think i want it though.  fiddly comment:  may be VERY HARD to introduce a new species mid-to-late game if there are predators around.

but viewed in the ebb/flow perspective, this is a bit SmallWorldy -- don't get to attached to any species, the species isn't the point, the food is.

Fun, interactive, and a cut throat game that will not create hated among players. Unique mechanics and strategy. Defensive strategies or offensive strategies? And a number of combos you can make with tour number of species. Also, beautiful art!

Cons: can be unfriendly to new players playing with veteran players. game can feel like you can't accomplish anything based on bad draws leaving you far behind only to be extinct.

Fun little card game.  Simple rules but some complex decisions, which is what I normally look for.  It has a similar feel to Magic in some ways, but a more broadly appealing theme and easier to learn.  The problem is, being a card game, you can get those situations where the person next to you has 3 long necks with 3 warning calls and multiple cooperation and foraging and you never saw a single one of those cards.

The game can get really mean when Carnivores start eating  all of your species at the end of the game and all of your points with them.

Also there's too many Last Stands which is not really a card that is fun to get played on you, it feels very Munchkin-esque.  EDIT: Just realized that Last Stand and Pounce were promo cards... yeah, I wouldn't play with those.

RATING: 5
The theme is great, and the cardplay is quite interesting, with an amazing amount of combinations from just a bare handful of cards.  There's some runaway leader issues, especially in the two-player game, though that's mitigated by short playtime.

The components here are great, with the puzzling exception of the cards.  Though they're the most important component, they're cheap feeling, difficult to shuffle, and prone to chipping on the edges with black borders.  Perhaps the lack of coating is to reduce the deck size?  But the rest of the components are great.  The art is wonderful, the starting player dino is incredibly cute, and the things like the trackers and the cardboard are heavy-duty.  There's even separate custom-printed drawstring bags for the players.  How gorgeous!

In the end, though, tthis game is confounding.  I have yet to actually have fun playing this game.  It's a weird mix of confrontational and light, in a way that is somewhat unsatisfying.  Every game has ended up feeling rather anticlimactic and just not fun.  It should be fun, it's just that I and the rest of my group just can't seem to find it.

The game is very fun. However luck-driven, you have to pay attention to what your opponents play, and tactical choises are needed. If you want to win you basically have to do the same things, and have to use the same attributes again and again, but because card drawing determins your options every game will be a bit different, but not too much. Do not expect very deep strategy and deep development of species. It is more about changing attributes of species over the game to make them better or accomodate to the current status (no carnivorous for instance, or more carnivorous...). So the game is a light game with fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A solid game.

To start, the artwork on the cards is absolutely stunning.  Not that this is necessary, but it ads to the beauty of the game and, when you spend hours playing, it helps to have something this nice to look at.

The game is simple enough to teach quickly, which allows people to get into the game with ease and limits the number of times you have to pull out the rule book mid game.

As for the actual gameplay, some of it is luck of the draw, as you have a deck of cards from which do draw.  However, what you do with these cards can have huge impacts and provide new combinations throughout the game.  With the so many traits and ways in which the traits can interact there is no one strategy which will always result in winning.

And since the cards you are dealt give you a random combination of traits (depending on how well you shuffled from the last game), you may easily find that the trait you thought was useless before has now become incredibly useful.  It took me almost a dozen games before I figured out how to effectively use fat tissue, but now it has a place in one of my strategies.

This game has the potential to make you think more strategically than chess, allows you to make changes to strategy that can seriously swing things, and you can be as confrontational or passive aggressive as you want.  It also lets you play mind games with people as they try to guess whether you replacing certain traits is a bluff or if you're completely altering your strategy mid game.

I tend to purchase games based upon a few things.
1) Do I think I'll like this game. (I'm spending the $)
2) Are there people in my gaming group that will like this game (I'll need someone with which to play)
3) Is the price worth the potential for play

When seeing it on Kickstarter I figured I'd like it and I might have one person in my gaming group that'd also enjoy it.  After playing I've discovered that I love it and there are many people in my gaming group that also really like it.  As for the price, that's up to each person individually.  For me, it was definitely worth the money, plus I was able to help something I believed in become a reality.

For me, the only thing keeping it from being a 10 is that there's always room for improvement with games and it's not quite universal enough  (though it's impossible for a game to appeal to everyone).

Evolution is one of my favorite games. It packs so much game into such a small card set and simple rules (including an amazing integration of theme and game mechanisms, a personal favorite of mine) that I find each game extremely satisfying, win or lose.

The multiple races within the game provide consistently fresh decision sets- the race for food in the watering hole, the race to build a plant-eating engine or defend against carnivores. Particularly pleasant is the balance the game presents between offering interesting tactical decisions each turn (what should I use this card for- it's ability or to create a new species, etc.) and having a moderate ability to play strategically as well.

Finally I find the different and interwoven levels of player interaction to be excellent. Directly competing with your opponents via carnivore attacks/defense or working to starve them out of their amazing engine through watering hole depletion are each just wonderfully fun to pursue.

The one con that I have found for the game is that it seems quite simple to players at first and so can be easily dismissed.

Would like to play this some more, interesting mechanics, beautiful components and appreciated how quickly it played even at a higher player count.

For me one criticism is how the dynamic changes when a predator arrives on the scene. Thematically this is very well handled but I'm not keen on the 'aggressive' nature of them. The mechanic works well but I like less direct conflict.

Found on second play that I was quite put off by the aggresiveness of a carnivore strategy and how you are slightly pushed to this. Once one player does it dictates the game, this doesn't stop the game working at all, just not suited to my tastes as much.

This is fairly simple card game in which players try to build creatures out of trait cards to create an ecosystem of predators and prey. It is very simple, yet the card powers provide a lot of interesting combos and synergies to exploit, as well as providing tools to combat those very same combos. It's more tactical than strategic if that matters to you, but regardless it is a lot of fun.

It's not just the game play that is fun. We usually spend just as much time laughing over the silly combos of traits and giving our creatures ridiculous names. You even start to get attached to them a little bit, which only adds to the experience.

My appreciation for Evolution is evolving.  My initial distaste has given way to a curiousity of the many layers.  A strange game where players are seemingly competing Gods striving to create superior creatures. Eat the most food from the communal trough, devour other creatures, and keep your creatures from being eaten. It really is a very mean game from the moment it starts until the end. The bitter end. Also can be quite the brainburner.  Can get screwed by either the game or the players or, worse yet, both.  Evolution requires a thick skin.

For theme and gameplay variety, 17 feels a little limited, though. Just so many repeat traits and identical species. If it was an Eklund game there would be 173 unique traits, which is too far, but I think the right number is somewhere in the middle. I suppose expansions will improve this.

Rules are simple, gameplay is easy and then different strategies open up, there's a lot of interaction and planning and tactics.

I want this title so badly, but not at the absurd cost of 50€ a box.

The only problem i see maybe replayability isn't so high... but i need to play this again and again before deciding

Evolution is a tough game to talk about because our first play of it was so soured by what turned out to be a botched rule. However, that excites me because I love the idea of the game: you have your species and you help them evolve over time while starting new species and helping them as well. You can be an herbivore and mind your own business or you can become a carnivore and start eating everyone else.

The carnivores are were we started going wrong in our game. Each species consists of a body size, a population, and up to three traits. Whether you’re an herbivore or carnivore, you need to eat food up to your population size: you have four population, you need four food. However, an herbivore eats plant food from the watering hole and a carnivore eats the other species. When they eat another species, that species loses a population and the carnivore gains food from the food bank (not watering hole) equal to the attacked species body size. That’s what we got wrong, instead we just assumed one attack equaled one food and that led to a lot of species getting needlessly wiped out. In addition, it led to some interesting attempts at preventing the carnivore from winning the game by maxing out body size to make it harder for the carnivore, but in that case the carnivore would only need to eat once.

I’m withholding judgment on this game, but I look forward to trying it out again with the correct rules.

There's no doubt that the fabulous art is a large part of the appeal of this game. I am also attracted to the theme.

This game is kind of unique, because it actually plays faster with a higher player count. This is because the game ends when the deck runs out. With more players, you deal out more cards and you burn through the deck much faster. Despite being a Euro game at its core (food = victory points), this game is incredibly thematic. Every animal trait does exactly what you expect it would do. Highly recommended.

Card game of prehistoric creatures adapting to survive at the watering hole. Multi use of cards to add food to the shared water hole, start a new species, or grow or adapt your species. Everything centers around the food at the watering hole and the fear and threat of a carnivore. Be first to the watering hole to eat more than your share or go predator and eat your friends. Smooth game play with intelligent card interacting challenges. I love that a player can go extinct and still jump in with a new species (and one time still won!). I'm yet to see the carnivore last long.

For now this game falls a little flat for me. As a biologist I was extremely interested in it, and when the new edition came I eagerly preordered. But after a couple of plays it just doesn't feel thematic enough to me. It probably has to do with the fact that the species you're building never really 'come alive'. They always just remain a row of traits under a cube holder. I'm not trading this away yet, but it also doesn't have that 'I wanna play it' vibe... Heartbreaking really, as I was so hyped up for it.

Best boardgame I've played, highly highly recommend Evolution as it's a really legit great game, and best of all it's a troll game but it's legit trolling.

Evolution is essentially a game where you play god as you try to create the ultimate creative to survive life and predators from other players, by growing your species, giving them traits(insurance) to protect themselves or get more food which are your points. Once the card deck runs out and you play one more pile of it, the game ends and you total up your points to see who has the most food along with other factors that give you points.

I love this game, this game is so fun that I almost can't really think of any flaws for it, it's that fun.
So what's the con I can think of for this game? Well just certain specifics on how some traits work aka the rules for them, but it's pretty minor and you'll either figure it out or come to an agreement on it.

I don't know why any thinks 4 players is the best to play with because I think it plays best from 3-6 players. 2 is possible but certain parts of the rules are changed to accommodate 2 players, and that's fine but the more the merrier.

I learned a dozen new games this past weekend at a local con, and surprisingly this was my favorite.

[i]Evolution[/i] is interactive, well-designed, easy to learn (without being too simplistic), and seemingly a decent simulation of the rise and fall of imaginary species.

My only concern is whether certain card combinations are so powerful as to be insidious game-killers, and whether it's ten times more fun to be a carnivore than a herbivore.  Either issue could be a drag on an otherwise excellent game, though the latter concern is largely mitigated by the fact that players can control multiple species simultaneously.

I'm hopeful that we won't hit the "we've figured this out" ceiling anytime soon, and at first glance the game is good enough that I could be coaxed out of my purchasing hibernation to acquire a copy.

[i]Update:[/i]

Peaceful players will discover that fielding a herbivore-only team isn't terribly exciting.  And if no one goes carnivore at all, the game falls into a rut of fighting over scraps of plant food.  But it isn't always fun to be a predator, either, since many improvements are anti-carnivore - which can lead to quick extinction for new meat-eaters.

Looking to buy? Since I'm all about truth in advertising, there are five reasons why you might hate this game:

1. You don't like being "mean" to other players by eating their species. (Your own carnivores could eat your own smaller species, but what fun is that?)

2. It makes you upset when your species are eaten by other players' carnivores.

3. If no one decides to become a carnivore (due to #1 or #2), this literally becomes the most boring game of all time. As described above, many traits are anti-carnivore - and therefore useless in an all-herbivore game - and herbivore players are limited to low-key food competition and spawning new species.

4. Some trait combinations are quite powerful, and certain players can get lucky and draw those particular traits.

5. Due to the multi-layered trait interactions, there is a potential for significant downtime, depending on the number of players and their thinkiness. I'm not sure that I'd play with more than 4 players, for instance, since keeping track of the trait combinations and body sizes would cause me to blow a processor.

Anyway, I can see this being a great game with my high-interaction gaming group. People will enjoy eating one another, watching species starve for lack of food, laughing at the victims, and getting revenge. If that isn't your bag, you might skip it.

It's certainly worth a play, either way. It is a very good game, and even better with the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/176173/evolution-flight]Flight[/url] expansion.

Though the game is short, there felt like more moving game components around and dealing cards than actual game play. Player interaction is low, coming mainly from the carnivores. Artwork and game components quality are ok. The theme of evolution and survival is not very well-developed, though parts of it do come through.

I played a demo copy a few times and ran demo events three times at my local gaming convention. The game was very well-received by players. We all enjoyed the various strategies available as both predator and prey species. The right combination of traits can be quite effective in either case, though players must find the right balance between population, body size, and total species in play. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys a mild strategy game that involves a bit of luck and interaction between players. Species can be wiped out quickly, even ones that appear to have a strong lead with great combinations, so players will need to keep a close eye on opponents and adapt their strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I felt a bit skeptical about this game at the start, but our instructor had neglected to tell us that we scored 1 point per Trait Card in play, and 1 point per Population of our species at the end. We had played up until a round or two from the end under the belief that we only tallied up our gathered Food Tokens for our score. This makes a huge change and opens up a few more venues to victory.

In light of this, and how much the game has occupied my thoughts since we stopped playing, I'm rating this an 8 for now, and very much look forward to playing it again soon.

After a second play my 8 rating is certainly sticking around. This is simply a good fun time. I like how much gamer punch it packs into 60 minutes of play.

I don't mind some conflict in my games. I appreciate direct player interaction. However, I draw the line at another player going after and eating my own lovely creatures. No, just no. I may have actually rage quit during play.

I like the idea of improving and upgrading the species but this game is a little bit unbalanced as some cards are more powerful than others. I liked the first original edition more, although the artwork and the components are more puristic (maybe even because of this).

I love Evolution. So many fun combos to discover and you can use your imagination to watch the ecosystem evolve right there on your table.

Only played it once with 3 players, so maybe I'll change my rating in the future. It's a fun game with some really awesome traits for the species. Some of the combos are hilarious, especially when you think about the species you created and how they could look. And the scientific names you can create are great too. I'm not sure about the carnivores, because during the first play it was almost impossible to have a carnivore for more than 2 rounds, because after that he got totally blocked with the trait cards. It's easy to learn and plays pretty fast and I'll definitely play it again. Might move up in the rating.

Update: Played it twice now. There's some conflict potential, especially with the carnivores, so watch out. Otherwise, it's a fun game.

Very simple, but still a complex game. You need to use your imagination because it's a little bit abstract. If you can afford that, you will get some very cool animals out of it and you want them to survive! Great as a short main game for your gaming night and best played with 3-4 players.

A little bit less than we expected it to be, though a few more plays can perhaps change this.

Evolution is fairly simple and highly engrossing. I introduced it to a non-gamer who picked up the basic strategy immediately. It mimics the tension of survival quite nicely, as you must ensure your species' survival. Great game.

I played this once with 6 players and we were all new to the game.  I really like the mechanics for evolving and growing your species of creatures and playing to get the most food at feeding time was interesting.  I don't feel like I really got to see the whole of the game though as a lot of high cards kept getting played for food and there were very few carnivores in our eco-system so very little dying seemed to be happening which was a little concerning.  I could see my rating going up if the game shins more with experience... or down a touch to a solid 6 if its just a light, quick card combo and score game.  I'd certainly like to play again to find out!

Simple game with a very interesting theme. Played with two players it isn't very entertaining. I hope it will get better with more players.

Easily the best mechanical-expression-of-a-characteristic game I've played.  Brilliant.  Just terrific art.  Also, the start player marker is a six-inch apatasaur meeple.  So much win.

I like that getting eaten by carnivores is not a game-wrecker, although it obviously hurts.  The card interactions and combos really make this game feel right.

Egy kétfős játék után lemondtam az előrendelésem. Egyáltalán nem rossz, de ennyi embernél egész egyszerűen vmi hiányzik belőle. Többen biztos jobb, nem akarom lehúzni, adok még neki majd esélyt, de ez nálam így nem must have, főleg nem ennyiért. A pontszám is csak iránymutató, mehet ez feljebb is, ha többen játszotok.

Kipróbáltuk négyen is, de nem változott a véleményem. Egy erős 6 pont, ennyi, DE
adok neki még egy esélyt, egyszerűen olyan jók a kritikák róla, h esélyes, h vmit én nézek be vele kapcsolatban. Szeretem a tablóépítős játékokat, jó a téma is, így egyelőre nem engedem el a dolgot.

A 4. játék meggyőzött, h én néztem be vmit, mert összességében ez egy jó és ötletes kártyajáték. Nem mondom, h kötelező, de mindenképp próbára érdemes a tablóépítés szerelmeseinek. Lehet konfrontatívan játszani, lehet békésen legelgetni, de a kombinálás és a szituációkra reagálás fontos elem, ez adja a játék sava-borsát.

This is a pretty average game to me. What I like about it is the interplay between people that really looks like it simulates evolution, as well as the fast game time and ease of learning. I play this with larger groups of people (3+) as 2-player seems a little gimped and boring. The game is very easy to learn and we play this enough with some of our less board game inclined people. The mechanics are overall average to me however and I like most of my other games a lot more.

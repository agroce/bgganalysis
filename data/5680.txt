A tough call for me. I feel it hits the 'sweet spot' of complexity for an operational design (although the special cases are hard to keep in mind), but it misses perfection 
by a few factors.

By having three action cycles in a single turn, it means some moment in time
are more important (say for supply status) than others. This feels very wrong.

There is a physical complexity issue with the flipping and unflippings - it goes a bit beyond my tolerance, especially due to supply status at the start of turns: you end 
up flipping/unflipping things 4 times per turn, going throughout every stack in the game.

Towards the end of play, supply starts to become a really major factor. The byzantine interconnections which govern whether a unit is in supply are too much for me to accurately assess on a regular basis - I'm often changing my mind about whether something will or won't be in supply when it will matter (you have to assess these things ahead of time for planning).

It's very easy for the Confederacy to lose this by making a mistake or getting
a bad sequence of initiative rolls. They don't have the excess forces to take chances.

The Union perhaps should have a slow and painful option to use the railways they capture. It might involve garrisoning them. Probably would mean more special rules though.

The good side though - it provides a tense situation for both players, and emphasizes
maneuver over combat. It's a particularly interesting situation, as each side has
very clearly defined but different goals (even if they slip your mind easily as you 
fixate on sub-tasks).

Pace is very good for opposed play, but like Civil War, it works nicely solo as well.

This is the precursor to the fabulous Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series; now somewhat obsoleted by Grant Takes Command. GTC is a little more complicated, but it's worth it, and GTC is part of a huge, 6-game series, so the extra investment is worthwhile.

There is a second generation  of these games out there, but counter graphics are better in this one. Great Game. Symple sistem, play it and anjoy. There are a plethora of short and unbalanced scenarios (they are good to practice the system and last no more than 1 hour each) highly recommended in order to bring new people to the hobby. Thanks Joe.

Only played Basic Game so far, but I'm really enjoying the maneuver and pinning options. Rolling for initiative is also a fun bit of tension. I'm sure the Advanced Game adds all of the really good stuff.

RATING: 7
Predecessor to GCACW series (which I mean to play some day). Bigger scale means you can play out Overland Campaign in a single session (unlike, say, Grant Takes Command). No hidden movement, but variable impulse and movement rates introduce enough uncertainty to force the players to think operationally and not spend their time over-optimizing SPs and MPs. I don't know if the Confederates have much of a chance if they don't make good on their shot at Union forces as they move through the Wilderness.

RATING: 7
This is the game that got the whole Great Campaigns of the Civil War series going. Scale here is 2 miles to the hex vs. 1 mile for GCACW, but other than that you will notice the same mechanics, albeit slightly rougher than the more elegant system of the later titles. This one covers much the same ground as Grant Takes Command from the GCACW series, but you can fit it in a smaller space. Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The activation in this game is similar to a chit pull system except you use dice to determine which side can activate. Using dice instead of chits means that you or your opponent can potentially move, move, move before the opponent gets to move. And unlike a chit pull, the player gets to determine who activates.

I rated this highly because of the nice variety of scenarios at various difficulty/complexity levels. Some may not like it because you may only use a small portion of the map in some scenarios, even though you need the whole map for the campaign.

Others may not like it because of the CRT. It appropriately demonstrates just how devastating it could be even to win a battle in the ACW in regards to casualties. I remember winning a lot of Pyrrhic victories where, if I had been playing the campaign instead of a scenario, there would have been no way to carry on successfully.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on limited play of the basic game scenarios. I'm generally pleased with this system, although certain aspects feel a bit wrong. Soft ZOCs, combined with an extensive road network and super fast cavalry, means that cavalry can waltz circles around your "road blocks" and you never even get a chance to react. I have not tried the advanced game yet. I suspect that my rating will improve after playing the full campaign and/or some of the advanced scenarios. TRADED

RATING: 9
This is the precursor to the GCACW series by Joe Balkoski, and as a game, this one is excellent.  Like GCACW, it's very amenable to solitaire play, with a relatively low unit density and an almost zen-like, slow pace that I really enjoy.  The game is also easy to start and stop pretty much whenever (including in the middle of an action cycle or turn), which is great for those of us trying to get in a few minutes of gaming time in a household full of interruptions (child, dog, real life, etc.).  Unlike most of the GCACW games, the scale of this one allows a full campaign (advanced) game to be played on a single 34x22" map, and I enjoy the more long-term logistical problems brought in by the advanced rules (although overall, this is a pretty simple game with an excellent rulebook).  The inability to attack with multiple corps at once is probably the only downside (the support modifiers work, but are lower than I would have expected), something changed in the later GCACW series.  I played the hell out of this one (every scenario plus and extra one in the General), and will return it to the shelf for a while, but I would gladly play the advanced game again; I am certain my playing was sub-par!  The best $12 (plus S&H) I ever spent on a game!

Lee vs. Grant is a solid wargame that captures the vital elements of the Civil War at the operational level: maneuver, command, supplies, and inconclusive battles. Although overshadowed by GCACW, it is still worth the attention of any wargamer. I wish the system as presented here had been used to simulate Sherman's advance on Atlanta, the Red River Campaign, and a host of other operations. It will not happen though and I am reminded of wishes and fishes. At least I can still enjoy this underrated classic of wargaming.

Simple system with numerous 1-turn introductory scenarios focusing on various segments on the 1864 campaign initiated by Grant in an attempt to capture the rebels' capital Richmond.  One standard size map with detailed geographical features.  Joe Bolkoski's cycle driven game was first seeded here, which evolves later into better and delicate designs in Great Campaigns of American Civil War.  An excellent designer's historical note is included in the rulebook.  Overall, a highly recommended item and a must-have for all civil war buffs.

A great system and low counter density on a single map. Unfortunately, by this time in the war, there's little striking power left in Lee's army.

An interesting game system that is very chess-like. A paucity of units on the board and therefore you better think carefully before you move. This is a thinking man's wargame. Best for the gamer who likes to ponder.

Gets my vote for some of the best rules presentation in wargaming. That aside, this system was the prove the basis of a successful operational ACW system that neatly represented leaders in terms of move bonuses. The one drawback is the subject matter: the Wilderness Campaign being rather like France 1914 in that a war of manoeuvre soon bogs down into trench warfare. The muddy map reinforces this impression.

I finished the Short 3-day scenario to get the rules down and now I'm half way through the Long Campaign game and I thought I would give my initial impressions.

Lee vs Grant has an interesting system that I enjoy, but for some reason, more than any other game I have played, it gives me intense Analysis Paralysis. Not sure why but because of that it does not bode well for me to solo play often. I find combat to be somewhat frustrating and not fulfilling. Maybe its the nature of the attritional warfare being simulated or it could be the lack of unit diversity (or maybe I am doing something wrong). The system is really about out-maneuvering your opponent, but the options for the Union are severely restricted due to the fact that keeping your leaders in Primary Supply is quite difficult the further South they move (again, maybe I am just doing something wrong).

My initial reaction is that the system would do better in another campaign.

BGG Rating: 7 (it could drop to a 6 if the endgame doesnt get more interesing)

UPDATE: Finished the Medium Scenario (Advanced Game, 6 turns) solo on VASSAL. That was enough for me. I just do not find this game exciting at all. I would be willing to play a FtF game, but, for me, its not engaging enough for solo play. I'll probably give the short scenarios a go on VASSAL sometime, but not anytime soon.

This is a great game--much like a less cluttered, less "procedural" version of GCACW.  The Advanced Game is probably less taxing than a typical GCACW Basic Game scenario.  

The scenarios can be played in the blink of an eye, which can be good, but can leave you a bit unsatisfied.  The full campaign, though, is really no chore at all.  I am glad to have purchased this, as I really doubt I will ever get in a full campaign game of Grant Takes Command.

RATING: 6
While the simplicity and ease-of rules in this system is certainly appealing, I'm not a huge fan of hex-and-counter wargames, especially ones of operational or lower scale.  As such, this is right on my boundary line for difficulty, and the payoff isn't quite worth it.  Movement is simple, and combat is very quickly and simply resolved, but the entirety is simply too detailed to be satisfying.  

I understand that this title has a lot of fans that are especially appreciative of the [geekurl=/wiki/page/GCACW_Series#]Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series[/geekurl] that came after it, which for them is doubtless a step further into the operational grit and detail that they're looking for.  I will leave them to it, as even this is more fine-grained than I really want.

This game exemplifies the historical problem for which wargames occasionally get accused of missing the forest for the trees.  The map is extraordinarily intricate, there was clearly a lot of research done into the campaign, and the composition of armies and ability of leaders has been analyzed in minute detail.  I have no complaint there.  However, the knowledge and control that the players have over the location and movement of their own pieces is wildly better than what Grant and Lee had.  Players also have full knowledge of the goals and strategies of the opposition, allowing a clean game of maneuver and counter-maneuver, but one where certain historic mistakes that happened from misinformation (Like Lee's failure to meet Grant in time at Petersburg) have no way of happening.

Which is not to say that the game is entirely bad, or isn't a good fit for people who like these kinds of games.  If you are the type of player who is looking for a quick-playing traditional operational wargame on this campaign, this is a great choice.  The quibbles I have with the genre almost certainly don't apply, and you can focus on the fact that this is relatively quick-playing, well-researched, and polished.

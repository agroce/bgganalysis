Unique party game that requires you to provide and pull quotes from a book of your own in order to satisfy different prompts. What line from Moby Dick is something you'd overhear in the White House? What sentence in Slaughterhouse Five sounds like an action movie one-liner? Nothing revolutionary, but certainly something fun.

I'm a book-nerd and I spend a lot of time with other book nerds so this one is something I feel I should have. It will probably not be taken out especially often though which is the reason it isn´t on the wishlist.

Print-N-Play, pretty fun take on "cards against humanity" that lets the players be their won jokes, starting with the book they choose! We had a daily christian testimony, 50 shades of grey, the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, and harry potter, and taking things out of context was lots of fun!

Cards Against Books

Party Box
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Just cracked this one open this past weekend.  We grabbed a bunch of random books (health, romance, finance, Dr. Suess, fiction, etc.) and placed them on the table.  We made a house rule that you had to pick the book before the statement was read, and you had to change books every round.

We loved it.  Super light, super fun. lots of laughs.  I would definitely add this to your collection if you like fun party games. Very easy to adapt to house rules.  

We picked up the Kickstarter version.  (A little bugged that they sold to Gamewright who was then able to produce a Gamewright version before I got my Kickstarter.  But hey, I would have done the same thing if I were in their shoes).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The prompts on the cards seemed well-made for the game, allowing plausible / entertaining responses from a wide variety of book-types/genres.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
A lot will depend on the books you choose and the players involved.  But our first try proved really funny. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really enjoy this.  The game has the potential range of very cute to downright disturbing, all depending on what group is playing.  Kids can play (and should!  They see answers differently, and quite often have the best responses), and it is still a fun party game.

One of the better party games I own, and one with much more scope for people's creativity and humour to shine through than this genre usually allows.

Open-ended and creative, this is more like an activity (a la Telestrations) than a game, really. Simple & very enjoyable.

RATING: 7
Great party game, especially for those who love reading!
Using the same mechanic as games like Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity, BYOB take impressing the judge to a higher level by making you use a book that you bring as the source for all your answers. It's interesting to see what kinds of answers people can come up with, especially when the mix includes publications like a Presidential biography, a pioneer romance novel, a modern fantasy novel, and a guns & ammunition magazine.

The Gamewright version of the game also has a space inside the box cover where you can write down the publications you've used to play. More creative than Apples to Apples, less hateful than CAH, and not as much of a blank canvas as Snake Oil or FunEmployed. I would pull this out with people who LOVE to read.

Apples to apples, snake oil, cards against humanity, etc. This is a clone of that style of game. But the category cards are interesting. The novelty of this one will keep it in my collection. It's fine.

RATING: 8
Good books to use — or so we’ve found:
• Logic Puzzle book
• car owner’s manual
• children’s non-fiction 

Basically, what’s really useful are books that have lots of headers and lists, shorter paragraphs, call outs, and quotes.

RATING: 8
I was more entertained by this one than I expected!  It is basically Apples to Apples where a card is flipped looking for a quote that matches a particular theme.  Everyone then has a minute to look through a book they brought to the game to find a suitable quote.  Amusing answers ensue and the "question master" picks their favorite!  heh

The only Kickstarter I've regretted backing. Months overdue with little updates. I'm impressed with the look of the KS edition, but I've lost a lot of the interest to play it.

RATING: 8
A brilliantly obvious-in-retrospect idea - the Apples to Apples genre which I still haven't heard a good name for, but with the players digging through a pile of books for fragments of text to best match the judge's card. Fun to have something that tests the skill of judging books by covers and rapid skim-reading, and it seems a nice thing to do with a friend's or pub's bookshelf.

Sadly it seems as though the fun is very much dependent on what books are brought to the table, with borderline Cards against Humanity profanity possibly 'winning' the round. I get the feeling that the skimming should be timed to avoid the uncomfortable silence, and I like the suggestion that once someone has found their 'answer', the sand timer should be halved and the last one should be given a random page to select their increasingly likely surreal reply. After some research I leaning back towards Stinker for wordplay fun.....and if I enjoy that game I might get this one as an expansion of prompts for Stinker :-)

It's just another Apples to Apples, but wait... With books! I love books. Our whole family does. This game is totally uninspired though.  Pretty much any book will have something entertaining but slow players suffer and at the end of the day we've learned that Quiplash (from Jackbox) does this type of game better than any print version.

A fun novelty party game. Much more fun than your standard "pick a card from your hand" answers, but it does require extra effort from the players to make the game a success. If the players don't want to put in the effort to bring a book and have to search through it, pick a different social party game.

An incredible game. Well constructed and cleanly packaged. Fun for individuals or families alike, Bring Your Own Book combines finely designed mechanics with the limitless possibility of your existing library of books, comics, magazines. Prescription drugs, that tag on your dog, your fortune cookie fortune or that thing on your mattress you're super not supposed to tear off but, come on, you know you've considered it. You hear that Markle down the street pulled his off, and he's just fine. I mean, he has a limp, an affected Southern drawl and wears crocks to formal events but you're pretty sure that would be the case with or without the mattress thing. 

Look, don't be a Markle. Buy the game.

We played my friend's copy of this game this weekend and I just may have to pick up my own copy. It's similar to Apples and Apples/Cards Against Humanity, where you are creating and completing phrases on cards, but rather than use a hand of cards to do this, you use your favorite books! It plays faster than we expected, and there's nice variety because you can play with different books each time.

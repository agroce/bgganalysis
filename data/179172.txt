Always enjoy playing, and recommend every chance I get. Thematic, lots of choices, great sense of accomplishment at end of game.
For those concerned about the "Take That" elements, the rules allow a "World Peace" variant of the game, which is great for first time players. Or a more relaxed play-through in general.

Pretty fun game that is seemingly very unbalanced. The 'take that' aspect is here to an excess, but the effect greatly depends on the players around the table. No engine crafting here either which is a missed opportunity. Much of the scoring depends on access to cards and the player who gets them first is likely the clear winner. Blueprints and Events are significant examples of this. Having said that, the theming is wonderful with great illustrations and humorous subtext. So pretty fun overall with a simple system of stacking cards, but lacking any clever details.

Plays more like a 3.5/5 if you play it right and make the right decisions.  Really fun engine building game.  I like Imperial Settlers, but my partner didn't.  We both really liked this one.  The theme-park theme is very strong so if that doesn't do it for you, there are other engine building games to try like IS or Evolution.

But the game itself has lots of replay-ablity and randomization.  Choose 3 of 5 decks for a new game each time and different levels of take-that.  It's not super strong, but there is some.  3 players seems to be quite idea for this game because in 3p games you go after the leader and it self-balances out that way in a good way.

The 3 of us that played this, all wanted to play again immediately.  Some really tough decisions to make which is awesome.

Highly recommended and one I'l definitely be adding to my collection.

Not a bad game. 
But some issues.

Some mechanisms would only be activated during the game, which are not spicified in the rulebook.

"Unfair" cards too terrible, for beginners are definitely nightmare unless checked before activate.

Too many mechanisms make the game difficult to demostrate.

Artwork, production values, manual is stellar! Top notch in every way.
The gameplay fell flat in every group I've tried it with thus far. 

Others felt like the scoring objectives were mundane and didn't really play up the whole idea of building a fair. 

The "take that" objectives weren't too horrific, despite suggestion otherwise, but also not really much of an add, either. Participants would have been perfectly content to have a game where building the best theme park was the goal. There are variants of the game that allow for building only. 

I still have great desire to play this with other groups and see what we can do to try and generate the level of love for the game that I have for every other facet of it (the stellar Kickstarter execution, the artwork, the manual, the ambiance, the theme, etc...)

I'm hoping to change my score higher as time goes by, but right now, it's just not grabbing folks as I'd hoped.

RATING: 6
A functional, good looking tableau builder. Clever 'Smash Up' style set up allows you to scale for players and adjust game elements at the same time. Actual gameplay is mostly '51st State' tableau building, but with a much simpler economy, and the continual disruption of a heavily 'gotcha' based event deck. Gotchas are both random and extremely powerful, so it never really feels like a game where you have much control over your fate. There's some clever design and nothing is broken, but this isn't my cup of tea at all.

RATING: 8
It's a fun "city/civ building" style game with a funfair theme. What I like about it is how at the beginning of every turn, there is a phase where everybody gets to pick on each other and ruin/interrupt the progress of others. Definitely a fun game to try out.

Build a theme park, attract guests and earn money. Along the way bribe officials, frame your opponents and deal with external events.

Lots to balance - it has an economic engine (how many stars of attractiveness your park has) but it is capped (capacity of your park). It some attack/defence with event cards that can chip away at other parks, but the events are also defenses.

Beautiful art (by the team that did Steampunk Rally and Santorini). It really makes the theme come through

Helemaal mijn thema.  En ook origineel concept afwijkend van de andere in mijn collectie.
Je kan wel een strategie opbouwen ondanks het gelukselement, maar pas op als anderen die DOOR hebben.
Je moet er echt wel tegen kunnen dat anderen je pesten.  Daarom niet geschikt voor kinderen!!
Veel tekst op de kaarten ook.

Twee speelbeurten met 4 spelers en de standaard pakketten.  Volgende keer een variant proberen!

Fantastic!

No game of Unfair is ever the same given the mixture of themes and random order of cards drawn. 

There's a large range of attractions to build in your park and many different events that can take place.

You can choose whether to play offensive or defensively, or a mixture of both. Peaceful competitiveness can exist thoughout or descend into outright battle once someone decides to attack another player's park.

The cards are amazingly illustrated and detailed with a range of paths to take and careful balance between luck and strategy.

Highly recommended.

This game brings great balance between fun and strategy to the table. One step further than a usual familiar game, card mechanics are cool and original, theme fits really well, and game grows as the rounds go on on a exciting way. Art is amazing, and as the first rounds could be a bit low, later the game became thrilling! You must like games with interaction because you and your opponnents will be destroying attractions as much as you can!

A couple of friends and I had the pleasure of meeting the Good Games crew and demoing Unfair at GenCon a few weeks ago.

Great Kickstarter and fantastic themed card game that offers a huge variety in replay with the multiple themed decks.  No game will be the same due to the way the game setup is formed.  The mix of building your park whilst defending it and interfering with other players parks means there is always something to do.  The art is also wonderful and there is so much scope for future expansions.

Truly fantastic game, and very unique. This game is so thematically engaging and makes great use of all its mechanics. Perhaps the coolest thing though is the level of customization the different theme packs allow. A game with Pirates and Robots will play VERY differently than a game with Ninjas and Gangsters. I really cannot wait to see what the expansions bring!

Well done tableau building game.
Problems: The rules are poorly written, but no real problem.
The round structure is non-intuitive. There is a bunch of take that cards in the game, which I dislike. The event cards bring a very strong random element into the game.
Overall this game is okay, but I feel no desire to play it again, on the other hand there is no aversion towards playing it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is unfair! It can be really cutthroat if played correctly and with right decks. If someone is doing well he can be destroyed in few rounds when everyone gangs up on him. It's possible to defend but it's really hard to defend from everyone. But it's ok. It's just this kind of a game. Plus you don't have to play that way. Every event card can be played aggressively or for you own benefit. For me this game has to be played all out, it's what makes it so good.
But apart from that it's a solid card game where each player is building his theme park. It's relatively fast, it's fun, it's beautiful. What more to want? :)

Such a disappointment. The game is beautiful, the theme is awesome, the mechanics are sound, and the game is genuinely fun to play... for a while. The arbitrary "F-you" cards, however, just ruin it for me, and I'm not just talking about the personal events. Usually there is a pretty good incentive for players to play positive events on themselves rather than attack an enemy. 

But why play a game where you spend all of your turns laboriously trying to score a blueprint card, when a card can arbitrarily force you to lose all of those points in one swoop on the very last turn? How is that fun? It makes no sense. This could have been a [u]great[/u] game. But as it is, it is worse than mediocre: it's bad. Tom Vasel had it right: 

"Unfun."

Finally cracked open my KS of this game.  My cards are mis-cut, but my initial foray was so fun that I sleeved everything so I could continue playing.  I look at the theme less like I'm a GM of a theme park competing with other parks, but instead like I am the ambitious director of a "land" competing with other directors of other "lands"  in the same park.

I absolutely love theme parks and roller coasters so when I saw Unfair's theme, I knew this was going to be right up my alley. The art is so great that my group loves to just look at the images and read the funny flavor text on most of the cards. I really enjoy the various decks that can choose and mix for some variability each time you play. I also love the individual blueprints so that each player will possibly go for different goals to win. It seems that there are multiple strategies to win so I very much look forward to putting in more plays to test them all out!

A pleasantly vicious game lopped onto a card engine puzzle game. It is an interesting experience. The game played pretty quickly but felt like it took forever which probably isn't a good sign. I would play it again with the other factions. I typically don't like games that require reading a ton of text on available cards and then checking to see if the text refers to cards that are available or that you already have etc. and then finding combos in the text. Very tedious for me. So the core game just wasn't fun for me.

I was honestly surprised by this one, having heard all of the doom and gloom about "take that" in this game.  It turns out that the biggest adversary of the game is the city itself, in the form of the Unfair cards.  There is still a decent amount of Take That depending on the deck chosen for that game though.

This game is Unfair in two directions: the city cards can punish you (as can other players), but you can also get unfair advantages from either the city cards (Funfair), lucky draws off the deck, or a huge bonus from a blueprint.  The Take That cards are built to counteract the unfair advantages that one player can get.  The more we play, the more we learn the decks, the more we see what cards are key to certain plans, the easier it is to strategically target those rides/upgrades with Take That elements.  Otherwise, it's almost always better to use the positive side of an event card.

Here's what I really like about this game: each of the decks is well-crafted around certain strategies or other aspects of the game (building big rides, getting lots of money, working with blueprints, etc.).  Not only do the various combinations interact in interesting ways, but the decks on their own contain lots of internal synergies and combos.  Learning these decks really lets you take advantage of these synergies (and helps you figure out what your opponent is probably up to, which informs intelligent Take That play).  I was honestly surprised by the depth in these decks.

This will stick around for a while due to the great gameplay, great theme, and great art.

RATING: 10
Demoed at GenCon, and fell in love with the game. I love Disney parks, and I love board games, and this seems like one of the better theme park games out there. The theming and flavor text are excellent, accurate, and humorous, and the game play itself is actually pretty deep. The Event cards introduce some tough decisions, and balancing your income between affording better upgrades and just trying to quickly increase attendance can be tricky.

While the "take that" aspect can get a little contentious at times, I actually like it, because it keeps everyone from playing in their own vacuum. If the only interaction was in competing to grab upgrades from the market, it would be kind of boring. Adding these elements from other players keeps you involved in paying attention to what everyone else does at all times.

I like the different starting decks, and my only wish is that they were a *little* more asymmetric than they are. The ability to add future expansion decks to this has me super excited though. And the game already has great replayability as it is.

Theme park building card game with lots of choices. This is a fun card game but there's "take that" from both opponents and from the game so this might not be for everyone.

My biggest issue with this game is that it's unfair.

I can't say I wasn't warned.  It's right there in the title.

The artwork is gorgeous and the production values are top notch, but I just don't enjoy an hour-long game with this much randomness.  Let me win or lose on my own merits, not because the flip of a card helped me and hurt my opponents.

RATING: 9
Great tableau builder with reactive elements built-in. Take that is competitive but rarely devastating (save for a few nasty cards). Game feels well-balanced with a lot of avenues to victory. 

Art is gorgeous though I was hoping for a nicer finish on the cards, they bend very easily--will likely sleeve them. Biggest complaint is the set-up and tear-down time, longer than some heavy games I own.

RATING: 10
Every game is a unique and refreshing experience. There's no one way to play the game and win every time, especially with how many different theme packs and Game Changers there are. While the rulebook is immense for newcomers to board games, I always found myself learning something new with every game I played. With so many things going on at the same time (defending against aggressive events, managing money, making sure blueprints are fulfilled), my friends and I have found that we feel the pressure of running and investing in an amusement park much like a park manager or CEO. It brings me back to my days of playing Roller Coaster Tycoon, only now with rules and challenges that makes the game come alive and feel real. This is a game I will absolutely pass on to the rest of my family, and anyone else that is willing to try something new.

Unfair was unfun for me.  I liked the idea, build an amusement park.  But there was far to much take-that going on in our 3 hour-long, 4 player game.  Having someone steal half your money, having another player take an built upgrade from another player and put it into their hand every round, getting to build random stuff for free, etc... I get that the game is called unfair.  I like randomness, hell, I rate Talisman a 10.  I like having monkey wrenches thrown into my engine, as I enjoy Gloria Mundi, but what I don't like is a game that tries to be a cerebral point scoring, tableau building affair that plays like Munchkin.  It could be argued that if I played repeatedly I would become familiar with the cards that might be levied against me, but with the playing time of this game, it is not going to get another chance from me.  Which is kind of  a shame.  The art really speaks to me, the graphic design is good, the rules are laid out nicely.  I just didn't have fun playing this game after the first 30 minutes or so.

On first glance this game seems really confusing with a lot of things happening, but once you get in the swing of it it flows really well. 
There is certainly a fair amount of strategy involved. There are 'take that' elements which I enjoy when playing with adults but avoid when playing with kids. It is easy to avoid them by playing with the nicer decks. 
There is enough variance that it does not get boring with multiple plays. 
I really like this game and cannot wait until there are more expansion decks.

Good production values.   Solid game.  The take that cards can really knock the wind out of someone's sails for a turn.  I wish the designer/publisher had thought of some more subtle way for players to interact instead of using such a blunt instrument. 

I really like the arc of the game though.  You want to setup up for your super attraction, then leverage that to give you a blueprint strategy.  The game does a good job providing clear short, medium, and long term goals.  I wish more games did that.

Played over 8 rounds, players compete with each other to keep their rides open and generating money, and eventually trying to prevent the game itself from damaging their parks or limiting their growth. Enjoyable gameplay but even with the beginner themed decks, this game is mean.

60-90m, 2-5 players. < 5 plays.

Great beginning to a very F-un game. Unfair is a great game to pick up and the rules are quite straightforward. Have played 2, 3 and 4 player and it gets more and more fun each time. 
My gaming group are pretty cutthroat, however I've also played with kids and it's pretty toned down, so I feel like any worries about the game being too difficult or cutthroat are a bit unfounded ( this isn't Pandemic where the game is trying to make you lose! )
BONUS: I got my game on Kickstarter and like many my cards were mis-cut, however this was promptly accommodated by the team and I'll have a new cards shortly. The team even made it easy to get this fixed rather than working strictly off emails. - Big Kudos to the Unfair team!

That said I look forward to the new installments to the game. I've heard the ALIENS rumour, but am hoping they check the comments for other suggestions: Dinosaur, Medieval/Castle, Egypt/Pharoah, Undersea/Atlantis, Snow & Ice, Candy/Food, Magic...

2017-05-15 : First play - fairly straightforward engine builder with a heavy dose of take-that. It's not bad and it's got decent to good graphics and layout, but there isn't anything remarkable about it, it's the very definition of an "ok" game.

RATING: 3.5
Boring card game lacking in interesting strategy decisions.  Significant luck factor influences victory; "Unfair" is an apt name for the game.  "Take that!" element did not appeal.  Pasted-on theme.  With four players, a three hour game that overstays its welcome by about 60 minutes.  Not recommended.

This game just works.
nb Blueprint (bonus goal cards) were tricky bc they may require having a very certain card that may not come your way. Seems *unfair* -- though having less variety would reduce some of the engaging depth.
Perhaps working towards a goal takes enough time that other things cannot also be done- and that trade off can create interesting choices.

Great design too.
Didn't expect the theme to work so well. Looking fwd to future plays!

One of the things I really like about this game is there’s as much interaction with other players as your group would like. You can build on your own park and rarely interact, kinda like Dice City, or you can play cards that mostly do (counter-able) mean things, bringing in much more interpersonal engagement.

The theme is outstanding, and so are the components. Once everyone knows the game well, gameplay moves along pretty quickly.

I’ve played it about a half dozen times so far, and enjoyed it every time.

I really feel like I'm building a theme park when I'm playing this game.  It's like the boardgame version of Rollercoaster Tycoon.  I love the art, especially the panoramas.  It is simple enough for non-gamers with enough strategy and replay for seasoned gamers.  It has the right amount of "take that" and an option to not play that if your group doesn't like "take that".

RATING: 8
Reminiscent of Smash Up, but with a better theme.

The card combos are decent, and allow for a variety of strategies.

With the 'first game' setup of Robots, Vampires, Jungle, and Pirates, the 'take that' was not present much, and when it was it wasn't too mean.

Played again, swapping out Robots for Ninjas.  Boy, that ramped up the 'take that' aspect.  I'm not sure I like that much take that, especially in my particular group since we tend to not be as confrontational.

After a 3rd play (Robots, Jungle, Gangster), I really see different combos coming out and the variety of play enhanced.  This time around a lot more Events were picked up and played.  Not too much take-that, even with Gangsters.

This is one of my favorite tableau builders.

Cons:
- Blueprints, they take one of your 24 total actions to get any, and by the time you do you may have already started down a path that doesn't match what you drew, basically wasting that action.

Variant: 
Played once (and will continue to do this) where we dealt 3 blueprints at the start and you had to keep at least one, but could keep more (like Ticket To Ride).
Really gave some direction in those early rounds, as well as saving at least 1 action with not having to get blueprints later if you didn't want.

Sixth play tonight. Dropping the rating below a level where I usually will keep a game. I love the theme, I love the art, I actually really like the gameplay EXCEPT for one critical phase of the game, which is the events phase. Because people can enter a round with up to five event cards in their hand and then get a sixth card during the event phase of the new round, that event phase can last FOREVER, especially if players are new to the game and unfamiliar with what the event cards do. Because there is so much text to each card and the events you can play on other players can be so critical, it really slows the game down to a crawl. I've never played this game with four players and had it last less than two hours, which is simply too long for a game of this type. Every time I play it, I wish it was better and then I wish I was playing something else. I'll be trading this one away.

True to its name. Ever wondered how well take-that attacks would work in a chewy efficiency Euro? Here's your chance to find out, I guess.

Also, it maybe overestimates how much most people care about the exact division of labor in an amusement park back office. And how much fun it is to think about other people thinking about vampires.

It is what it says: unfair.  The cards are not necessarily balanced; some and just way better than others.  But the theme of building your own park makes for just such a delight that you forget about any kind of unbalance that might be there.  Beautiful art and components.

Very fun game. In my first play I made a couple of pretty bad rules mistakes which kind of hindered the game a bit, but I played again with the correct rules and it was great.  Pros- Theme is great and flavor text is funny.  Hopefully new expansions give the game different plays.  The game moves fairly quickly and there are different strategies to follow.  Cons- Not much to complain about.  Some of the Event Cards are painful and can really screw people over, but in my two games it wasn't too bad. Vey fun, would recommend, can't wait for expansion packs!

I have frequent game parties and this is the single most requested game I own so far. It's simple to learn, but has a ton of complexity you can dive into to really ramp up your end score. The ways that you can screw with the other players, as well as the end game when the actual game starts to mess with everyone adds such a twist that can take the mightiest of plans and bring them to a screeching halt. They call it UnFair for a reason! You have to be prepared for many contingencies!

I am a really big fan of this game, had a lot of fun with my family playing it. My mother freaked out about the rules so we more or less went through the giant rule book 4 or 5 times before even playing. For the most part it was a whole lot easier despite the rules being so gigantic, it really makes sense. However there are a handful of cards that there is a description for but you really need more information that isn't in the rule book to understand how to use. I would recommend adding a secondary reference manual or making a forum on BGG (ideally the first or both) that is card specific for all of the cards that have wonky abilities on them just for clarity. I am also very impressed with the company and their communication and desire to help. These are really great people...

RATING: 7
En Unfair, cada paricipante trata de construir un parque de atracciones en su despliegue personal con el fin de conseguir más público y más ingresos que el resto de participantes. El juego incluye 6 mazos temáticos (ninjas, vampiros, robots, piratas, dinosaurios y gangsters) con el fin de personalizar la experiencia (cada uno tiene sus características en lo que se refiere a ingresos, dificultad...)

PROS: La modularidad de sus cartas le hace tener gran rejugabilidad. El tema siempre resulta agradable a todos, especialmente a los jugadores de videojuegos del estilo Coaster Roller Tycoon o Sim City. Buen grafismo y "lore" en las cartas que le añaden ambientación. Las cartas de bocetos (blueprints) le dotan de cierto sentido,  con un efecto parecido a las cartas de ruta en Ticket to Ride.

CONS: La modularidad de su diseño, le hace tener una preparación algo tediosa. La  mecánica de las cartas de evento, que permite hacer jugadas sucias a los contrarios ha sido acusada de ser demasiado determinante. El problema es que si no tuviera esta mecánica en su diseño, le habrían acusado de ser un solitario multijugador.

En definitiva es un juego con una ambientación atractiva, pero algo largo y con mucha variabilidad en el desarrollo de sus partidas para ser un juego casual. Nota tentativa = 7.1

RATING: 7
Mixed reaction based on the first play . . . really like the decision space and many of the card interactions.  I concluded the game feeling like there was more to explore.  Theme of the overall game is really good.  I felt like some of the event cards were more powerful than others - some of that is situational, but others just seem way better.  Similarly, at least one of city events really tipped the value of turn order.  Others were just too punishing in general . . . 

Overall good.  I felt like the game had a higher ceiling than it might have actually achieved.  Maybe a bit more play-testing would have smoothed out some of the event power levels.  I felt as though dialing down the severity of some of the punishing events to "annoying" rather than "potentially turn destroying" would have left a better impression.  As is, you either take the full punishment option or use the "World Peace" game changer, which would appear to push the game into multi-player solitaire space - which I don't think is what the game was truly going for.  Also, a bit longer to play than I thought it might be, which would have been OK except for the potential for events to blow you up.

Chaotic, random and with a lot of 'take that' element.

As theme parks grow you quickly lose track what of co-players are doing and what they are getting at.  And frankly - you don't care...

But the biggest problem is the game is just... boring.

All these issues are unjustifiable in a ~2h game.

RATING: 5
Tableau builder that's really thematic and interesting. Unfortunately plays wayyyy too long (3 hrs) in my first play and the cards variance in "power" is way too swingy. Some cards are absolutely useless and costs too much, and some that are powerful costs very little. Don't know if this is a bad design or something I'm missing, but I don't think I'll want to play this a lot.

I wanted to get a few plays in before I gave it rating to see if some of the shine would wear off. Just the opposite. I am so looking forward to my next game. 

I have played all the theme decks now but I still have several strategies buzzing around in my head that I want to try out. Each person who has played with me has loved it as well.

Once the players are familiar with the game, the game time (from setup to tear down) takes 45 minutes for 2 players and around an hour for 3 players. The time goes by quickly and the interaction is pretty consistent. Both of which are perfect for the games I really enjoy.

Sometimes small change can have too powerful consequences - one city event cost me to lose over 60 VP (major VP amount for a blueprint with bonus points changed into a VP penalty due to a demolished upgrade card)

Me and my wife really like this game and have had plays with 3 and for 4 people. The "take that" can be taken out if tits not your thing and the theme is what draws in my friends that are not interested in War, Fantasy, or long euro style games. Its bright, colorful and often times hilarious. Agreed not a game for the hardcore or deep strategists but if you want fun 1 hour play time even with 4 players I would recommend.

Participated in the KS of the game and have had a great time playing it since it arrived.  The organization of the contents (something many games seem to forget about) is amazing, and it fits all the cards sleeved (which I did immediately), the artwork is whimsical and fun and the strategy is surprisingly deep.  I have really enjoyed this game and am looking forward to expansions.

EDIT:  I have now played this game several times with different groups of people and I have to say I love it more with each game I play.  The re-play ability is huge, and with expansions on the way it will have even greater replay-ability.  It is always a huge hit with my play groups and is my most requested game to bring to any game night.  The "take that" element, while present, has never impacted any game in such a negative way that I would remove it from the game.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to build a theme park... by any means necessary.

Unfair is a strongly divisive game. The fun amusement park building is marred by a strong take-that element.  Adored by some — not my family's idea of a "Funfair".

RATING: 10
I love Unfair! I first saw it on kickstarter and thought this is the game for me.. so I ordered it through them. ( I love carnivals ) It is fun to play competitive ( like closing each others attractions ) throwing that zombie promotional card at others people, and lots of other ways. So far every friend I have played with really enjoys playing it as well. 
I love the art on the cards and the game-play. Overall I do recommend it if you like a good competition ( though you can choose world peace so you cant effect other players parks ) I like the game changers included to change it up a bit. 
Its great to try out different themes and mix it up each time. 

I hope you get a chance to play it if this seems like your kinda game.

This is not an un-fun 'take that' game! Just enough randomness to get in the way. The scoring is a point salad, but with some dressing tastes just fine.

Just one play in for a 2P game with the recommended decks, and I am wanting to get this back to the table right away for another 2P or 3P game.  Rest of game is sleeved now.  Will update rating again after my first impression rating, but I am thinking this will be played often, especially since my 8 year old liked it.

Good fun game that isn't too hard to learn. Probably too much take that for my liking, with the potential for all of your hard work to be unravelled in one turn if someone plays aggressively. I like how it has a variety of decks to pick from making a lot of different deck combinations.

I wish I could rate this higher. It's just so swingy, no one wants to play it with the take that element (it works fine without) but the randomness is not fun when it overstays it's welcome.   Some cards are so overpowered.  There's not enough to do for the amount of time (2+ hours!) it takes to play it.  Love the theme, but it didn't hit the mark.  My copy has replacement cards.

Second play was played with the other decks and was nasty, very nasty. Upgrades were getting removed left and right. I held on to a ton of defensive event cards to avoid losing upgrades and also hired the full time worker that blocks one incursion each round. One round an opponent mesmerized him and everyone else went after me but I had enough defense cards to stop them. I won but it was close with someone else who attacked a lot but also completed three blueprints (I didn't complete any). 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

STAY OFF MY YARD, er THEME PARK! I'm uncertain what to think after my first play with the recommended sets at 4 player. It is interesting and enjoyable to build up a tableau BUT there are a ton of cards that remove upgrades, etc from your park. If you don't like seeing your stuff your building torn down at times, avoid this game OR play with the variant where the evil stuff doesn't occur (but this means some cards are then crap).  It was also frustrating to build a theme park and have about 25 stars but only be able to collect money on 15 - the cards granting increased park capacity weren't very available and were snapped up quickly when they came available. This is a very swingy game. There is some planning ahead but you need to be able to think on your feet and change tactics quickly if people attack your park. Artwork is great. I am a little disappointed about the card size issue, but thankfully the company is replacing the cards.

A fun little card game about building your theme park with various theme packs that you play with each game. The game plays well, and smoothly. The graphic design and illustrations are pretty great as well. The problem is that the game doesn't do all that much that is different or interesting. It's fun, and plays well, but it just isn't something that I feel like I need to own. If someone wanted to play it, I would love to play, but I definitely don't need it in my own collection.

Jeder Spieler versucht in diesem Spiel seinen eigenen Freizeitpark zu bauen und kann dabei gelegentlich bei den anderen Spielern in ihren pfuschen.
Innerhalb einer Runde darf jeder Spieler 3 Aktionen durchführen (Karte aus dem Markt bauen oder auf die hand nehmen, Karte aus der Hand bauen, Ereignis/Bluebrint/Baukarten von den verdeckten Stapeln ziehen und eine behalten.). Auf Blueprints stehen Aufgaben, die beim Erfüllen am Ende des Spiels Siegpunkte bringen, bei Nichterfüllen Minuspunkte (Ähnlich Tickets to Ride). Ereigniskarten werden zu beginn einer jeden Runde gespielt und können die Regeln Ändern (4. Aktion für den Spieler, mehr Geld, mehr Besucher, Attraktionen anderer Spieler werden geschlossen usw.). Die Baukarten sind die eigentlichen Attraktionen, die Upgrads für Attraktionen und Park-Mitarbeiter die man in den Park baut (und bezahlen muss).
Nachdem jeder Spieler seine 3 Aktionen ausgeführt hat kommen die Besucher in den Park. Man zählt die Anzahl an Sternen die jede Attraktion/jedes Upgrade bringt und so viel Besucher (Geld) erhält man aus der Bank. Danach folgt eine neue Runde. Nach 6 Runden ist das ganze auch schon vorbei und alle Spieler erhalten Siegpunkte für jede Attraktion, je nach Größe des Ausbaus (nach einer Tabelle) und die Mitarbeiter geben meisst direkt SP.
Anfangs dachte ich bei dem Spiel: Oh nein, so textlastig und alles auf Englisch. Aber die meissten Karten wiederholen sich tatsächlich und man muss nicht mehr allzuviel Text lesen. Mir hat das Spiel sehr gut gefallen, allerdings würde ich tatsächlich auf die deutsche Version warten und ich würde es eher mit 3 Spielern, wenn nicht sogar nur zu zweit spielen.
Die Attraktionen zu bauen und dabei Upgrades wie Toilette oder Superlooping (bei einer Achterbahn) oder ein Theater aufzumachen mit einem Roboter-Vampier Thema macht Spaß. Es gibt auch genug Interaktionsmöglichkeit durch die Ereigniskarten, die Teilweise sehr mächtig sein können (Ich habe einem Spieler einen 10 Siegpunkte Mitarbeiter abgeworben in der letzten Runde).

PnP beta Aug 2016 pre-KS - Backed

Great file set, fantastic quality. Easy build, if tedious with over 200 cards to cut out. Played 2p and we quite enjoyed it. The level of cut-throat play feels right. The limited number of actions per turn is very restrictive so it's hard to get everything done. I'm not a fan of the fiddliness of set up or that the end game scoring needs a table. But the play is overall quite good and the variety that comes from the mix of cards is nice. Interested to see what the KS campaign adds to the mix.

Played a few more 2p games, trying out the alternate theme decks. I still quite enjoy the game play but the variable powers can be quite swingy so if someone gets something powerful early you might not have much of a chance to catch up. But the effort to mitigate the damage is still quite fun and not aggrivating.

Always a big fan of engine builders and this one has a lot of great ideas.  I love having different themes that are shuffled together to provide different experiences from game to game.  Limiting how many attractions can be built and how much money a theme park can earn each round can help keep one player from snowballing due to luck.  Great art and I love the theme!

However, this game majorly benefits from know which city event cards may come up.  I recommend letting your opponents look through the city cards before they are shuffled and set up for the game.  Gives them a few ideas of what kind of bad things may happen to them so they can better prepare.  Maybe even do that for the blueprint cards, but that is not as essential.

I think I'm ok with the player event cards being a bit mean.  It helps give someone a chance to catch up to the leader.  Plus, there is a bit of a trade off since they no longer get to use the good event.  Makes it a tough decision.  If the mean event is helping their position more than the good event, then by all means play it as such.  

Not sure I'll play this 4 player again.  Takes too long for what it is, I think.  Felt like the cards I needed were more diluted in the deck due to have more themes compared to a 2 player game.  We had a lot of fun bashing each other, though.  I can see this getting a decent amount of play for me as a 2 player game.

Without the brutal city event cards, I think this game would have potential to be one of my favorites.  I think having to plan around bad events ruins the game for me on some level.  Still enjoy it, but odds are it won't be a favorite.

Enjoyable game - probably the most successful I've played in the theme park building category.  There's a nice balance of powers, events, attractions to keep things a horserace throughout.  Seems a little hard to gain ground with making money up front and the wealth of information across the cards does lead to a little bit of analysis paralysis.  Solid, though would have to be in the right mood with the right group to play this one.

This game is unfair.  But I digress... On the positive side, theme is spot on.  Solid mechanically. On the negative side, it can be a drag if you just don't see the specific cards you are looking for. The flow of the game is a bit non-intuitive. Play events first and then draft cards. It appears that the setup and takedown is a pain but not a problem for me as I don't own it.  Happy to play it again.

RATING: N/A
Pros: Great artwork! Great theme! Very good production quality. It's clear that designer is very detail oriented as can be seen from double sided board, card panoramas, and etc. Game changers are nice that they make each game session different, especially when playing with different groups of people.

Cons: Card effects have such a high variance that it's okay to play this game casually, but hard to play competitively. Some city event cards demolish upgrades, or close particular types of rides, and it's impossible to play around. Some cards let you roll two D6 and earn that much money based on what you rolled, so if you are lucky you get as much as 12 coins, or not so lucky you get as little as 2 coins. Some cards let you build an upgrade from your hand for free. In the early game this is huge if you draw the right combination of cards as it's a huge income boost and you start off way ahead. There are tons of cards like these which are more luck based than skill based. The fun part of the game is really building rides and customize them with upgrades, yet it's very difficult to get money. If you are not lucky enough to draw events and/or low cost rides to boost income in the early game, you have very little chance to compete with other players. Also some cards can be nasty when messing with other players. Yes the game is called unfair, but unfair events are really no fun.

All in all, it's a good game, but not good enough to justify occupying a shelf space, thus sold my copy.

PNP Robots / Ninjas / Gangsters crafted 9/9/16.

Kickstarter.  Received 3/5/17.

The graphic design and production values on this game are top notch.  Another nod to the publisher for the brilliant way they handled the campaign, from the constant communication to the replacements for miscut cards / warped boards.

The game itself has a unique theme.  I love being able to make robot ninja rollercoasters with death defying loops.  It's just fun thinking about the frankenstein'd attractions.  Game play itself is smooth and varied.  I feel like it's more replayable at lower player counts since you only use 2 themes, rather than 4 at a time.  This makes for a higher amount of combinations.

Each deck really plays differently.  Some focus more on income, while others focus on events or encouraging you to make wider, sprawling parks.

I will say that some of the events can be downright mean.  However, we usually play with World Peace, so it's not much of an issue.  The top actions usually have much more lucrative effects anyways.

+ Unique theme
+ Production value and art are AWESOME
+ Each deck really feels different
+ Best at 2 players
+ Fun combinations of attractions and features
- Playing with 4 players lessens replayability
- Negative player events can be brutal (i.e. closing your main attraction for 3 turns in a row)
- Endgame scoring is a little clunky

Love, love, love this game. The theme is excellent, the art is excellent, the cards and components are excellent. Unfair is a heavier amusement park building game in which you can take multiple themes and smash them together. Did I say smash them together? like smash up? yes i did and that's because this is smash up done right! This game does not over stay its welcome like smash up did. In fact the more you play the game the faster the playthroughs will be. We once finished a five player game in just over an hour. The box said it would take over 2. Yes, the game can be a bit mean with the take that, but hey its called "unfair" for a reason. Plus it is only as mean as the players allow it, I've had nice games and I've had very very mean games. Yet, i still loved them all. My only complaint about this game is some people are too butt hurt to play again after a mean game. Suck it up!! Also, I want more themes now!!! haha.

This game is sooo much fun and addictive to boot. It's a tableau builder in which the players are trying to build the best theme park in order to lure the punters in and make a load of cash, The game uses thematic decks that can be mixed and matched to alter the game play and vary the experience. 

This has me wanting to play it at every opportunity. The more I play it the more I think the discussion around the 'take-that' nature of the game is being overstated. heck without it the game would be accused of multi-player solitaire.

Not as fun as I thought it would be.  The different decks don't add much.  They pretty much do the same thing just with a different theme.  I was hoping that they would have different feels like the vampire deck sucks money from other players or the gangster deck makes you roll the dice every time you get money.  Instead it just has different rides with a gangster theme on it.  So, the games all feel the same.

Awesome game! The first game of 2017 that has really struck a chord with me. In many ways, this feels like what Terraforming Mars should have been. I love just about everything about this game. The way events play out is really interesting, the way you build up your park with notable quality rides versus having a whole mess of them, and the freedom you're given to use cards in your hand AND in the card row...it all works so seamlessly. The artwork is also fantastic. I love how well it conveys that theme park atmosphere.

The only real area I feel like this game struggles with is how spiteful it can be. There is the option of playing a "friendly" variant, but considering some cards rely on hurting other players, you either have to weed these out, or remove some of them so that your games aren't as confrontational. I tend to feel like the game needs some confrontation, or else the only thing you'd really be fighting over are the cards in the community row. I just feel like if it was downplayed just a bit more that this could be an early candidate for game of the year.

As it is, I really do enjoy Unfair. It captures that feel of having your own theme park without going too over-the-top in trying to include every little detail. It may not replace the Rollercoaster Tycoon video games for me, but I love the combo building and the overall presentation. A definite keeper for me.

Didn't really expect this to do much for us, but it has become quite the hit.  Neither as nasty nor as long as people like to make out - and in any case it comes with the ability to tweak those parameters built into the box - its real strength is in the way that the various decks end up riffing off each other in different combinations, meaning also that its sweet spot is in the middle-player range.  Great art and genuinely amusing flavour text make this a keeper.

Unfair is a light game that has some punishing elements to it as the game goes on.  I did not find the game too punishing, but challenging, in my initial play.  What keeps this from a higher score is the first game was a little unsatisfying as it felt it ended too soon.  The initial game is 2 rounds shorter, so I am hoping the full game pulls this ranking up.

Very attractive aesthetically, but it is a gateway game.  If I had played it at the beginning of my hobby experience, I would have enjoyed it a lot, but right now, it does almost nothing new and has many boring cards in each set (quality star cards and the like).  I think they held back on adding stuff to the core game in order to have many, many expansions.  Unfortunately, the core game was not enough to keep me interested in the many to-come expansions.

The theme for the game runs throughout and is very well done. Little touches, like the suggested positioning of the cards to provide a prettier funfair, show some real attention to the theme.

I felt there wasn't as much differentiation between the decks as I would have thought, so there didn't seem to be a drive to get all the Vampire or Robot themed rides.

A lot of luck with the cards is very well mitigated with the market and the ability to "dig" for more cards.

Played the prototype at Bordercon 2015 and again 2016. It's an excellent game - over a year ago the prototype was far superior to most games on Kickstarter. The more recent version is polished, has plenty of replay value and is totally ready for market. It will be an automatic acquisition- rarely have I been this interested in a new game.
Fundamentally, Unfair is a tableau-builder. Players purchase cards from a common pool and add them to personal displays, either as new funfair attractions or as improvements - rollercoasters might gain a Pirate theme, and a laser show, while restaurants could get airconditioning or an express seating option. All this improves income and adds points. There are random events each round, [b]optional[/b] attack cards, special abilities, and [i]everything is true to the theme[/i].
Play is brisk, with a good balance of short term tactical moves and long term strategic decisions. Unfair is highly replayable because it has different decks of themed cards used to build a variable "game deck" each time you play. The themes are an obvious route for expansions, with new options already considered (watch the Kickstarter campaign for stretch goals!). Unfair also has bright, highly thematic art which is subtly humorous and [i]fun[/i].
Unfair deserves to be one of the most celebrated new games of 2016. Certainly it is the game I most eagerly look forward to.
I can't recommend it more strongly.

The game looks beautiful . The components are top notch.  Game play is fun . I feel the theme in each deck are lacking a little there needs to be a little more to make you feel like it is actually a pirate , robot , or vampire deck. This is a "Take That" or "Take this" type of game.

This was pretty decent. The trick is to not care about the evil take-that stuff that happens and just enjoy the roller-coasting ride of building your theme park attractions. A fair bit of the game is about finding cards that help fulfil your goals, usually based on fulfilling title or trait conditions in your tableau, and much of the result is dependent on whether these fall into your lap easily or you have to spend actions hunting for them. As well of course as how much you get whacked by events played by other players. There's a little too much of that for my taste so it won't see a ton of replay, and hence the self-parodying game title which seems an attempt to take the edge off the game by offering a nod and a wink. There’s also probably too much luck for the game-length, but it's fun enough while playing, with a nice presentation and easy-enough rules. The card variety provided by the different deck combinations, with no doubt all the expansions to come (I’ve heard the intention is to have a deck for each letter of the alphabet), is a plus during play - but a downside to pack away - and obviously adds to the game's appeal.

Don’t see the issues with take that complaints. You can adjust this, and the game is called ‘Unfair’. People can’t read anymore. They are “loosers”. (Gave up on correcting this word, so I have now adopted it.) 

Great variety of decks and combos keeps this fresh.  As you discover combos, you’re almost embarrassed at the amount of money you can make, but this is part of the fun, and it will take a few plays to see what works.  This is already too much work for most people who need to see everything in the first game, and cry like cupcakes when a game dares to have some aggressive interaction.  Multiplayer solitaire game design is now, unfortunately, the rage, so I am very happy to see ‘Unfair’ give the finger to a very depressing and boring trend.   

Design, theme, art, and most importantly, humour in the game and on the cards is superlative. Plays fast and works well for two players, another rarity in 2017. 

 This is my favourite game of 2017,  which admittedly isn't saying a lot, as this was the most yawn inducing year for gaming I have experienced since 1990; but Unfair is unfairly maligned and underrated. It is much better than a lot of the garbage in the top 100 which caters to the lowest common denominator, or should we say the general public.

Depending on whom you're playing with, the 'take-that' - factor can be very high. Also: a good starting hand (= some cheap attractions) can make a difference, but you can off course search the deck for a cheap attraction as an action.

Seems like a very cool game and I have been following it for a while now!

This was my first Kickstarter I ever participated in and it was a birthday present to myself. It was NOT a disappointment! The flexibility of changing the "take that" element is great. I also like the ability to never build the same attraction twice.

Unfair is a great way to get your kids excited about going to a real-life theme park by seeing if they can build a thrill ride matching the one they are going to ride. 

While there is no single player mode, I've found myself trying out variations of attraction building just to see what I can get. 
Good times!!!

Fun family friendly game pitting park managers competing with each other to build the best amusement park.  Game really captures the theme beautifully thanks to the gorgeous art and logical game flow.  Some gotcha elements that don't really have to be utilized but can if a player is running away with the game.  Though the hidden blueprints bonuses provide a bit of a fog of war element so you never really know where you stand against your opponents until the very end.

I was very interested in this game when it was being previewed, but then I started getting worried that it wouldn't be a game with good choices. i'm thankful to see that I was wrong. There are good decisions to make and you are limited with the amount of actions you get to take, so you have to be efficient. Build your theme park engine and watch it come to life. That having been said, I think this game really needs to keep the "take that" aspect in order to keep everyone in check. Force players to hold back cards to defend themselves. I'd say you just need to make sure that people are aware of the cards that are out there that can destroy an attraction and every upgrade that was on it. Without that, why wouldn't everyone just build 1 super attraction which gets you points faster because of the incremental scoring. The multiple themes and combinations make the game fun and somewhat new. Also, it is ripe for expansions of new themes and cards which will easily fit in the well designed insert. The only significant issue I have with the game is cleanup... re-sorting the cards into their respective themes is a bit of a chore.

I liked the first game we played, but the second game bored me.  Replay value seems very low to me.  Possibly not enough depth.  You're basically just trying to stack cards. It's a good game, but not one I feel I need to keep.  

One thing I did not like at all was the Blueprint cards and the difficulty rating.  For example, a card may display an "easy" rating but there is only one card in the entire deck that will fulfill the objective.  I also did not like how Blueprint cards are closed off at the half way point of the game (unless you have a special Event card.)

This game boasts great components, with beautiful art and design. The game itself is extremely fun and I can foresee a good amount of replay value out of the box. Each theme pack felt really different and building up the theme park and upgrading it felt really satisfying.

However, the "Take That" element as well as its randomness can be a turn off for some. Latter rounds (with the Unfair City cards) can also get very punishing. Added to this is the set up times and clean up times, which can take a while given the sorting and shuffling involved. 

Nonetheless, I highly regard this game and would definitely play it again given the chance.

In some ways it's comparable with Imperial settlers, but luckily without the way too small letters. It's still hard to read what your opponents have to in a way that doesn't make it directly obvious you are going to sabotage them. 

The theme is awesome! Finally a theme park game that is fun to play! I had my hopes set on Steam Park for this, and although Steam Park is nice, it lacks something, not sure what. 

Unfair feels like a complete game in which you are building stuff and sabotage your opponents. I like it!

The take that elements really are cranked up to the max and it isn't enough that you can turn them off either because it severely throws off game balance (allowing for a run away leader).

There's a lot of 'Munchkin' spirit in here if you want 'Unfair' to be truly funny. And that has a direct impact in what you get from the game if you are one of those who don't enjoy pissing your friends: 'Unfair' is best when part of your strategy is to be aware of what your opponents have and try to steal or simply saboteur their parks. If your group does not enjoy that side of gaming, then 'Unfair' won't probably be for you as, without the meddling, it's almost a multi-solitaire with cool art and great production value.

There are a lot of popular games that I don't like, but I can always UNDERSTAND why people like them (well, except for Splendor maybe). But I haven't the slightest clue why people are so in love with this game. It commits FOUR cardinal sins of modern game design:

-Single-target Take That cards in a 1 to 2 hour strategy game.
-Wild swings in luck based on card draws in a longish game.
-Beginning of the game goals you may have zero chance to complete, and zero control over whether or not you get to complete them. I hope you're good at drawing cards!
-Cards that let you search the discard pile (which bring the game tempo to a screaming halt). 

Wow. I strongly agree with Tom Vasel's review. This is random upon random upon random heaped on top of antiquated mechanisms. I'll never understand the hype or the love.

I have enjoyed the first couple of playthroughs very much. The "take that" mechanisms of which some people have complaint is a structural part of the game (thus "UNfair") and can be mitigated with some experience. If you take it lightly enough (it's a game!) it is not THAT much of an issue, and provides for very cool interaction and psychological gameplay between players. All in all, a very fun game.

This rating is after my third play pf the game.  Not really a fan,.  There just seems to be too many bad things that can happen (either at the hands of other players or the game itself) and not a whole helluva lot that you can do to mitigate these losses.

And the Blueprint cards - some of them have very specific things you need on them, when there are only two of those kinds of cards in the deck.

Not in a hurry to play this one again.

Absolute joyride, with ups and downs throughout the game that makes for both an addictive and nail-biting experience. It truly captures the feel of building your own theme park, reigniting the same joy I felt as a kid playing Roller Coaster Tycoon (albeit minus the fun of killing my park attendees). Only downside is the somewhat tedious setup and takedown, which is necessary for the modularity of the game, as well as the randomness in the "take that" aspect which at times makes the game feel... unfair.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A tableau-building game with a well-designed narrative arc, in that the first half of the game creates opportunity to expand, while the second half makes obstacles for players to overcome.  The more expansion a player did in the first half, the greater exposure to risk they bear for the latter half, so it serves as a catch-up mechanism.  However, as the Unfair cards come out, there is no forewarning, so a player who has specialized in one area may either have no effect, or may suffer an overwhelming penalty.  The event cards as well can allow players to target one another, and this style of gameplay is not our preference.

Very fun and good Kickstarter campaign. The game is a tableau building game with a theme park theme. The base game comes with enough themes to get you going for some time and allows you to tailor it to your play style (do you want high or low interaction). It feels fun and refreshing the first time you play it, but somehow it didn't strike me as a "waw, awesome!" game. Still, it looks great on the table, and it's a game that a lot of people want to play, and most people I've played this with seemed to have enjoyed it.

I playtested this at Bordercon 2016 and it'll be an immediate buy for me when it comes out. It's colourful, challenging, has a bit of "take that", and is engaging throughout the duration of the game. There is little downtime and a nice sense of progression through early game development of your fairground, mid-game building, and late game "here we go" to see who can triumph with the best theme park.

For 4 people, learning the rules, overall we took 2 hrs to play, so expect 1-1.5 hrs after a couple of play throughs. At no time did we ever feel that the game was dragging on.

There is plenty of humour throughout the game and great attention to detail in flavortext and subtle jokes. Expect some rule variants in the published game that will make it playable for as young as 9.

Played at Oasis in Atlanta. Awesome game. Has 6 different decks you can use (will have one per person), though you will only use 1 for each player. While you always have the option to do things that mess with your opponents, that generally comes at a cost to you. Fun theme, cards, and it works really well. Although it took about 2 hours for 4 people to play, everyone was still engaged and enjoying it right until the end. Would highly recommend.

Beautiful artwork! I love a game that provides multiple avenues to victory, which this does so well.. Each player can chase their own combo of sources for victory points, developing their own strategy for success.

The biggest critisism i've seen of the game, is the strong "Take That" elements, but I think those critisisms are not very well grounded. Each opportunity for a "Take That" attack, simultaneously offers an alternative boon to the player. Any usage of attack cards is essentially completely optional, often providing great reward for choosing not to do so. 

All in all a great game. As a bonus, the creators couldn't be more helpful and responsive on all the forums. Just pick any random forum thread, and you'll likely find a response from one of them, if not multiple!

Love this game!  My family and I play it often.  I love the card combos and the unfair aspect.  I can't wait for expansions!

I bought this as a late pledge on KS and have had it since January or February 2017.  I walked into my FLGS yesterday and was shocked to find this on the "Unloved Games" shelf.  So here I am, making sure I take the time to actually give this one a proper review.

I absolutely love this game.  I have played it 5 times now and have enjoyed it every time.  Every one of those games have been 2P, and I think 2P is where it really shines.  Why?  Because at 2P you have a lot of options.  You can pick and choose themes (factions) to tailor the game to what you want that day.  Want it to be a "take that" kind of game?  Pick the most "unfair" themes.  Want a friendlier game that feels more like simple tableau building?  Pick the least "unfair" themes.  You can create weird blends of themes if you want - one really focused on gold and one not at all focused on gold.  (I really, really  hope they do come out with some expansions to add more themes, because that would just make this even more replayable.)

The components are great.  The cards and other artwork are gorgeous.  The board is double-sided so you can choose which way to face the cards (a really nice touch).  The money tokens are sturdy and easy to distinguish from one another.  Every card I've picked up has a description that is easy to understand.  You won't be reaching for the rule book 50 times to figure out what, exactly, a card with a special power does.

The gameplay is filled with choices.  The most obvious strategy is to build rides - but do you build one ride with tons of upgrades or five rides with a few upgrades each?  Do you push building whatever you can, or focus on completing blueprints?  Rides can be worth a plethora of points, but so can blueprints - if you can manage to finish them.  Coins are also worth points at the end, but getting rich doesn't seem to be a viable strategy on its own.  Staff, likewise, are a nice way to rack up some points and can make all the difference in a close game.

What do I not like about this game?  There is very little.  We, personally, don't enjoy "unfair" games much, so we tend to play with Jungle, Robots,and Pirates.  But this doesn't hurt our enjoyment of the game in the least, it just means we see similar blueprints and special attractions more often.  The addition of some new themes (hopefully with some more on the less unfair end) would really put this game over the top as one of our favorites with endless replayability.

Backed on KS, don't regret it, love the different aspects to it, the take that elements of the game or removing them all together to make it easier or kid friendly, the ability to get rid of the randomness as much by drawing 2 cards and discarding 1, etc. Only played with the 4 player mode recommended in the book so I really need to try mixing the other decks in.

Overall a great game with cool mechanics, player interaction, amazing quality pieces, and lots of opportunity for future expansions. Super impressed with this.
Didn't give 10, because the scoring model rewards stacking improvements on one ride instead of diversifying to make things interesting...

Fun Theme Park Wold themed tableau building game. Take that options of event cards have significant opportunity costs, and many defensive event cards are available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mediocre "city building" style of game. Very confrontational with the event cards. Also the event cards seem very unbalanced and I highly recommend removing the "Gen Con" card from the deck before playing (if you own it). I think it captures the theme pretty well and the art and components are solid. Not complex to learn and pretty easy to teach. Overall not a bad game but nothing ground breaking either.

Oh man, this is a difficult game for me to rate. The theme, components and especially the artwork is top! The way to build your attractions, hiring personnel and resources is really in sync with the theme and results a fun game play.

HOWEVER the negative red city and player events really kill this one for me. Yes you can try to protect against them but why are they in there? You have a constructive (first half) of a game trying to get a money engine going, trying to accomplish those blueprints. And then the 2nd half you draw a red city event and one of your blueprints is messed up and you can't even protect against it. A random event can totally mess up an hour of planned game play. and there's nothing you can do about it.

What easily could be a 8 rating is now, with great pain, a 5. I want to play it and will approach the game differently but it could have been a really great game. Such a shame.

One needs to play it multiple times in order to not crash land right on the first couple of turns. On the other hand its a nice enginebuilder, but the random city and event cards favor players very differently. Some players might have an awesome start, other definitely don't. And during the second part of the game, some city cards crash different strategies without almost any control.

This is a good tableau builder with a great theme. What makes this game better are the event decks which change up the game just enough to make things interesting. I've only ever played the "nice game" where you can't use event cards to hurt others, but even that's fun. At some point I'll have to play that way though.

Really enjoyed this game and the way that the rounds are worked, the only downside is that it could do with some extra rounds to allow time to develop the park.

Great theme, fantastic art with very fun and engaging gameplay.  If you don't mind take-that this is a must own.  Even if take-that isn't your thing, you still owe it to yourself to give it a try.  It's a very fun game.

The tableau building is very intuitive and it’s very satisfying to see your rides grow over time. The blueprint cards help provide some direction, much like route cards in Ticket to Ride. Be aware that the game has a variable amount of take-that on the event cards, depending on how the players select to use them (the lower half of the event cards usually do something harmful to an opponent) and that there’s a Feldian level amount of push-back from the game (the last four rounds have “Unfair” City cards, where something bad happens to all the players). Neither the meanness of the event cards nor the city cards bothered us, though in the moment there can sometimes be good-natured grumbling. There is a fair amount of randomness and luck here, but there’s also some light strategy and medium tactics play here as well, in a good balance. The game plays smoothly and clips along very well at 2P. I hope to play it with 3P or 4P sometime soon to see how it works at those counts as well.

I didn't think this was my kind of game when I saw the KS and I was mostly right. Production value is soooo good but ultimately I just didn't love it. It's a good game...I'm just not sure why I don't like it more.

Played once, but not for me; its an engine-building game with high screwage and take-that is on steroids; our game took approx 2 hours to play. 

I find it that the game is too slow & chaotic, and the card distribution and the flop to be very random and can easily stagnate or stall players.  During setup, players are dealt cards; but I found that you could very easily get stuck with junk that you can't do anything with and are forced to dump cards; whilst your opponents who happen to have good cards start running away with points.

I took issue with one player who enjoyed the game that the game was pretty much won by the eventual winner all because of dumb luck of initial setup; whereas his argument was that the game was perfectly fine and had low-luck; I disagree -- the card setup is random, the distribution is random, the cards you're getting is random, you do not control your hand from the initial seed.   If the game fixed this, and ensured every player had the same initial seed as starting cards with a few random ones to tail-end their hand; then maybe, just maybe the game would have promise.

As a game I found that the amount of down-time and high take-that is very high; whilst this may appeal to some players, I really dislike it in games like this.   Everybody either ends up hitting the leader or plays king-maker.

Its not a game I wish to play again.

Any game that my kids are interested in playing is a good thing.  I especially like this game because the theme and mechanics seem to mix well.  I like weighing options and exploring strategies.  This game mixes some of my favorite types of mechanics, including hand-management, set collection, and to a certain extent...deck building (mild).  I also like that players have equal opportunity based on options in their turn available.

Nagyon tetszik, mondjuk ez nem csoda, hiszen a tablóépítés az egyik kedvenc játékfajtám, a vidámparkos téma pedig jó hangulatot biztosít menet közben. Összességében a Birodalmi Telepesekhez tudnám hasonlítani, de itt közös paklink van, nem egyedi, illetve eseménykártyákkal is meg vannak bolondítva az egyes fordulók. Amit fontos megemlíteni, hogy a lapok néha elég imbának tűnhetnek, de egy folyamatos adok-kapok alakul ki, így könnyen elképzelhető, hogy egy lehozott erős lapot a következő körben kidobat velünk az ellenfelünk. Igen, a játék elég konfrontatív, sértődősek óvatosan álljanak neki, de a biztonság kedvéért egy békés játékmód is helyet kapott a lehetőségek között.

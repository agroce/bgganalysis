An unfortunately-named game with a great theme, excellent art and production values, and surprisingly thoughtful play for such a light fun game. The only thing that keeps this from seeing more play is the appropriate, but (in US English, anyway) embarrassing title.

The 2 player game becomes a lot better when using additional rules like "lively monkey" and "frightening attack". With 2+ players simply a lot of fun. Also suited for playing with "non-gamers".

It is a hit and miss game, with the right kind of people this can be fun to play, with others it will not work at all. It's a humoristic game but due to the text of most cards it takes a while to get into, you should play a few times to learn the cards. The expansion Monkey Business makes the game better. This game is very luck dependent but some skill and understanding of the mechanics is required. This game can take 10 minutes to 2 hours to play so be warned.

Fun little card game. Build your pile of junk high enough to knock the taunting monkey from the top of your heap per your boss's orders. 

My only complaint is that the ending can come quickly if someone gets lucky with the cards. You roll the dice to see if you win and the closer you are to the monkey, the better your odds.

Luck-filled, leader-bashing game which ends abruptly when someone gets the right cards.  The theme is very weak; why would you build & climb towers of junk to get the monkey instead of just shooting him?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I've played two games of this combined with the first expansion, and it's not a game I enjoy at all.  Both games saw me shut down and demolished without ever even getting started; the expansion biases the game far more in favour of whomever can obtain gold early on, and without guaranteeing that the starting hand will include not just at least one junk card but a junk card that can actually be used, it's entirely likely a player will never be able to get anywhere.

Nice smart game. It has really quick mechanics and unpredictable gameplay. It relies a bit on luck (if you don't draw the right junk cards you simply cannot win), but the players can interact a lot to balance situations. And it is cheap too.

Don't let the juvenile title fool you, this is a solid beer-n-pretzels game with few rules holes and an Ernest-y "random stuff in weird combinations" sense of humor.  It takes a little longer than it should, and draw rule needs amped up a bit, but otherwise worth playing beyond the laughs wear off.

An incredibly dull game that was clearly named by someone with no sense of humor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Humorous, but like Munchkin, it's a game I'd only want to play occasionally, and part of the fun comes from *not* knowing the cards very well ("WTF is this card I just drew?").  Also, it's the type of game that has the chance of finishing quickly, if players don't draw the proper cards to counter other players, or finishing more slowly than dental work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun and humorous. Once in a while you'll get very unfortunate and have one match that just goes on and on and on. This can be frustrating, but it's rare and most games are played in a reasonable time.

Get people past the snickers and dismissive comments about the name, and you'll find that it's a highly enjoyable light-hearted game.  The game is well-balanced in spite of the fact that every card in the game is unique.  In fact, this uniqueness is part of what makes the game so enjoyable.

I say, build a tower out of superfluous games in one's collection, then play a game of [i]Boxthwap the Designer[/i] until he promises never to release this sort of crap again. Only play when you're plastered or high (or both), and still take precautions in case it breaks down. One bonus point for the artwork on the cards, which is clever and quite inventive of what you'd find at a scrapyard. Puts me in mind of the famous TV-series [i]Scrapheap Challenge[/i], limited to the [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huf3-gkkgZw]very first season[/url] of course.

RATING: 4
I liked this game in the beginning but it gets rather monoton after a while and now I almost never play it any more. The thing that almost happens every time is that the players build up their towers and then someone triggers the bomb and everyone has to start over from scratch and the monkey wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Spank the monkey by building towers (perhaps mechanich bull stucked on a pile of games, then add a escalator, logic -NO, fun, YES), smash your opponents with sea gulls, dynamite and a shade. Fun game to take out from time to time when the gruop is right.

Wonderfully whimsical "Take That!" style game in which a monkey is loose in a junkyard and players must build a tower of junk high enough to "Spank the Monkey" and win the game. A player's success or failure is somewhat dictated by the card draw, but the game is still a ton of fun. The cards are very humorous and the art is really good. The game is innovative and fun. Recommended.

FUN CARD BUILDING INTERACTIVE GAME.

RATING: N/A
Spank the Monkey is a fast-paced, humoristic card game with sneaky tactics. All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it. 

There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the "board" in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.

During the game you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself and the sneak attacks (lawyer, waspâs nest and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.

A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that wither lowers the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish and wok) or completely stops or redirects the attack (electric force field, tennis racket and trampoline)

If a junk card is destroyed you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card they fall down and are forced to make a collision roll to see if they also are destroyed.

The fifth card type is called special and is a kind of catch all for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake and having a police raid.

RATING: 5
This game is quite niceley presented and has some interesting and original elements to it. My 13 year old son quite likes it and would rate it much higher than I do, but I prefer games that are a little less chaotic. 

You can attack an opponent on one turn only to find that even though you win the attack you lose all of the cards in your hand. But that's OK because on your next turn you might win the game on the roll of a single dice. 

Definitely not my kind of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pleasant surprise to me. Weird, quick and actually quite funny too at times. 

It's more an experience game than a game you actually play to win. Try to picture how your towers actually look and have a laugh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
All luck, "take that" type game.  It's good for a laugh maybe on the first play...so I initially had it at a 3.  I've downgraded it after my 2nd playing.  Where's the fun?  It is easily the most annoying game I've played in 2 years.  Thus this game is a perfectly defined "2". I won't play it again.

A better game is to go around the table and let everyone pick a number between 1-6.  Then roll a die and everyone who got it right scores a point. Repeat 6 times.  Most points win.  Tiebreaker decided by a roll-off.

I dont know why we seem to like "take that!" game so much, but we do, and this one is a great variant of the genre! build up your junk piles and protect them while trying to knock down your opponents. be the first to "spank the monkey" off his pile, and you win.

Now about that name...  I know it's funny.. but it makes it difficult to introduce it to some of the more "senstitive" friends and family who would otherwise really enjoy it..  too bad.

Had this on my want list forever and am glad to finally own it. Basically, you are trying to build up a pile of junk to climb and spank the monkey at the top of his junk pile off. All players build their own junk piles and can reinforce their towers and attack other players towers during the game.

The game is a lot of fun and the cards are hilarious with lots of cool weapons, defense, junk and reinforcement cards. The cards have nice artwork and are of decent quality. You will have a lot of good laughs with this game.

Not that it's a big deal, but you do have to provide your own markers for keeping track of the monkey's height on his tower and your own 6 sided die.

Many thanks to a very special friend who gave me her copy of this game. I love it.

Worst... name... ever. (Thank you, Comic Book Guy.) The game itself is a well-though out "take that" design with a sense of humor that is not off-color or rude. Still, it's a "take that" game - if you're not ready to see all you worked for collapse in a heap thanks to an attack of pigeons, pass on this one.

Or, if you're like me, pass on it because the name IS offensive.

Odd theme, rather fun (although some of the humour will wear off after a couple of plays) and well suited for casual gaming. Explaining the rules takes about 2 minutes to new players. 

The winner is decided mostly by chance - the little bit of tactics that is involved quickly crumbles together with your junk tower.

One drawback is that the playing time can be extremely variable. Especially if playing with the "lively monkey"-optional rule. 

Improves if served with beer!

Spank the Monkey is a fast-paced, humoristic card game with sneaky tactics. All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.
During the game you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself and the sneak attacks (lawyer, waspâs nest and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.
If a junk card is destroyed you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card they fall down and are forced to make a collision roll to see if they also are destroyed, but dont dispare there are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake or having a police raid.

RATING: 7
Update: Down from a 7 to a 6. A game much in the same vein as Chez Geek. A lot of squinting at opponentsÂ´ cards to see if you can attack them. You canÂ´t build unless you draw Junk cards. Cycling cards is painfully slow as you canÂ´t draw more than two cards. As in any game where one player needs to reach a certain goal for the game to end, playing time is very unpredictable. I can enjoy this if it doesnÂ´t drag.

Mindless fun with some short-term tactics. Illustrations are above avarage. You must be able to read other playersÂ´ cards on the table, so it probably plays best with 3-4 people.

This game becomes more fun the more people who are playing.  It is a great, screw-your-neighbor type of game.  In fact, we tend to focus so much on knocking down our friends, that we sometimes lose track of the objective, which is to be the first to spank the monkey.

This is only after a few games.  I have only played this game with two players.  The first game was over before anyone even got to attack.  The second game was more exciting, but still the game seems to play too quickly before anyone can really get into it.  Maybe it plays better with more players, but as a two player game, I find it a bit lacking.

The game has a great concept - Each player builds a tower of "junk" cards to reach a monkey sitting atop his own tower of mixed recyclables. You can use weapons and one-shot items to knock down your opponents towers, but none of the mechanics feel properly streamlined and every game feels incredibly unbalanced. After 20 minutes strategic planning, winning or losing comes down to a simple roll of the dice. I'm still on the fence about this one...

[Gigantoskop 2003 edition] {Beer&Pretzels; sabotaging, no-winner; scalable} {'lively monkey' variant is preferred} A hilarious game with an interesting theme. I have enjoyable time with my friends. The artwork and quality of the cards are exceptional. The graphic and contents of the cards make sense.

Quite nasty and chaotic (but it's for hilarious, let the monkey win then.) Players are continually attacking each other, which makes it hard to spank the monkey, esp. with more players. However, it has a definite game end condition so that the game ends before players feel boring (unlike Munchkin.)  

There is a nice distribution of the cards; attack cards are not the most in the deck. As a result, sabotaging does not dominate the game (unlike Munchkin, Mille Bornes, etc.) and players have time to build towers and the game can progress to the end. Bashing-the-leader problem is moderately strong, similar to other beer & pretzels games.

Spank the monkey has a strong English barrier. Pace is slow in the first few games because players have to read the cards carefully. However, players would become familiar with the cards and the game flows faster. Nevertheless, there isn't a replayability problem for me so far because there are enough cards.

This is a good try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

A different game, with some fun, but not enough. It's got some humor in it, but doesn't save the game.

Having only played this 2-player, I think this is a light and fun game, along the lines of Chez Geek and Guillotine.  More players would add to the chaos, which I consider a good thing for this type of game.

A mid-weight card game where players build junk towers trying to climb high enough to "spank the monkey," all while fending off attacks on their junk piles from other players. In the game I played, no junk towers were destroyed (very few attack cards were drawn), and the game was over very quickly. Which is a good thing, as I found this droll but rather repetitive and dull and wasn't all that interested in investing more time here.

Reaches its goal, which is fast-paced, humorous, and entertaining luck-fest.  The cards are fantastic.  They're funny, well-drawn, and fit very well into the absurd theme.  Replay value is limited, as the gameplay is pretty weak, and the jokes are only funny the first one or two times.  The winner is mostly up to the luck of the draw, and even optimal strategy won't guarantee a win.  I've seen this game be shorter than the 15 minute minimum stated on the box, and longer than the 45 minute maximum.  Hard to use it as filler when you have no idea how long it will take.

A take-that game where you try to build up a tower of junk in order to be the first to the monkey. It feels a bit like a race to the top, but with Mario Kart like special abilities to hinder opponents as well as having to protect yourself from collapsing the tower onto itself.

Fills a similar slot for my play experience as Munchkin does, but I seem to like this game a little better. It suffers less them the 'lets pile on the leaders as he or she is about to win, better nuke him/her back into the stone age! Oh look, the runner up has won the game...'-problem I have with Munchkin.

It's okay but my wife loves it, so I'll stick to it.

I love dice rolling games and co-operative games AND real-time games. So, why do I very strongly dislike XCOM? It takes tense minutes of preparation and strategic thinking and reduces everything to a painful d8 dice roll. A lousy roll can just destroy your team. It's not enjoyable at all. This is the least fun co-op I have ever played. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Many aspects of the game design don't hold up. Overrated by the Xcom IP and maybe by having an app which brings little to the experience (could use more of the original Xcom game and bring more depth to the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not much of a "game" here. It removes the quarterbacking problem of co-ops by just giving players very little time to discuss the overall picture/problem and forcing them to focus on their individual tasks. The problem is those tasks are pretty dull and success is based on die rolls. I can see what it's trying to do but just dull in general.

Love the theme. But app requirement and clock mechanic render this a "no go".

If you liked the video game but always wanted to play a coop version with friends than this is the board game for you. Xcom the board game does a great job of replicating the video game experience on a table with four players and a app. Your team members play one of four very different roles which the game delegates different aspects of the Xcom program roles to. Some roles are more involved than others so different levels of interest/experience can be accommodated. Xcom is a fun ride but I find that there are two sticking points worth mentioning. First, the game runs a timed and untimed phase so ap players are effectively mitigated which is good BUT social play is reduced pretty dramatically. People are too busy trying to execute their role in the given time constraints to be bothered with a lively debate about whether Hans Solo was a pirate or if a smuggler is a subclass of rogue who is different all together etc. The second thing to note is that one role involves handling the game app which manages the game and handles upkeep. This, in my experience, makes that person the apps sock puppet/bitch. The person is effectively spending most of their turn doing what the app is telling them to and a little bit of it making some minor decisions. It can be exhausting. The tablet does not buy you drinks first either.

This game is just a touch rules-heavy for what it is (and in particular that you're having to do things under significant time pressure). That being said I've had a good time playing - our group has a bit of a meta now around my constant declaration that under my leadership we would be "a fiscally responsible organisation".

Wish this came with an actual rule book. Tutorial is nice, but most of my group was lost for the first two rounds. That said, I bought this game unresearched in the game shop... where someone recommended that this would be an excellent co-operative game for my parents (as an xmas gift). Too intense for them by far (though we'll play again and see)

1st play: I was a bit worried going into it that I wouldn't like it. I'm a big fan of the IP but I didn't want to get overexcited. The game was fun. I'm not a big co-op fan, and I was nervous that FFG would overcomplicate things, but the result was a thematic, exciting game that came down to the last couple of rolls. The rules aren't as clear as they could be (Because there isn't a rulebook), but it was fun and thematic.

2nd play: I love the theme and the different roles are interesting and neat. I'm not a huge co-op fan, and I'm not sure how eager I am to play again, but I do live the IP enough that I enjoyed the game, even if it doesn't have a ton of depth.

The intensity and tension of the timed sections is great. The resolution gets better the longer the game gets as players have more action cards to interact with.  Saddly the most depressing this about this game is the very low flavor impact of the base defense and mission component of the game.

I am one of those gamers who likes to have everything he needs to play a game included in the box.  I have not been a fan of games that require CD players or stopwatches and I was expecting not to like the XCOM app.  Actually, it does a good job of bringing significant time pressure,  doing some non-player stuff and keeping a multi-phase turn on track.   

I have enjoyed games like Tamsk and Space Dealer where you are playing against a time limit.  I think this works less well in XCOM for two reasons.  First, there is ample opportunity for sensible players to plan ahead of the small window in which they must act.  Admittedly, limited funds can derail a plan.  The second reason is that the decisions just aren't that challenging.  Obviously, the complexity of the decisions needs to be scaled to the time available, but I'm not sure that Lang has got this right. 

Mechanically, the only thing that strikes me as odd is conflict resolution, where, no matter the size of my force, if the alien wins they're all dead.  The dice used to resolve conflicts and to check for success in developing new technologies don't bother me so much as some commenters.  Certainly, with a one third chance of success with each roll, results will be varied, but the dice are rolled so damned much that luck should balance out. While random factors like those dice and the order in which cards are drawn will affect the course of each game, I don't see where genuine strategic variation will come from.

Fantasy Flight has done its usual excellent production job.  However, the artwork strikes me as muted and uninteresting.  Transferring the rules to the app and providing a tutorial mode has made the game much more quickly accessible than FFG's usual 25 pages of verbiage.

While I like real-time co-ops, this game feels hectic in wrong way. I (much) prefer Space Alert, where you have limited time to put everything in order, here you have strict "do that NOW in 10 seconds". Promotes too much shouting etc.

Another thing is that game is pretty much decided by lucky rolls and tech card draws. If you get good start, game gets quickly going. If not, there's not much hope.

I also like the idea of blurring the line between board and computer games. As long as applications or such remain as tool to make better games and do not become a meaning themselves.

Love the theme, idea, and the pressure of making snap decisions with the timed element. Communication and problem solving is essential.

RATING: 3
Played a demo and was super excited since I LOVE Space Alert and was itching for another real-time coop game.

THIS GAME FALLS FLAT.  I have no problem with the App (Love Alchemists and use an app and randomly generate missions in Space Alert) and I enjoy the real time aspect of Space Alert, Galaxy Trucker, and Goblins.  Lastly, I enjoy cooperative games that don't allow a dominant player effect (time constraints in Space Alert, and imperfect information in Hanabi disallow for the dominant player effect).  

Unfortunately in this game, most of the decisions are pretty trivial and don't require the in depth decision making like determining how to simultaneously kill a Phasing Frigate and stop a nuclear bomb going off on your ship by carefully coordinating multiple actions with multiple players in Space Alert.  It's simply allocating X amount of stuff to perform Y.  

To make matters worse, it then boils down to dice rolls.  Yes, you can "minimize risk" by taking certain actions, but it is just absolutely unsatisfying to depend on die rolls as opposed to a set list of procedures as in Space Alert.  I don't mind DETERMINING what comes up based on randomness(different threats in different zones and on different length tracks), but RESOLVING things based on die rolls is just too much of a luckfest for me.

RATING: 3
Really fun idea for a co-op game with horrible alien die mechanic. It spoiled the whole game for me and everyone I had the chance of playing with. Basically, whenever you roll dice, you also roll an alien die (d8) and if it lands on a value equal to threat (minimum of 1), you lose something (soldiers die etc.) and it forbids you from continuing rolling for this action. It's the stupidest and worst kind of randomization for otherwise a tactical game with a lot of resouce management and planning.

A gépi instrukciók és a real time játék miatt a Space alert ugrott be róla, de nekem ez kevésbé volt stresszes és nehéz.  Tetszik, hogy minden szerep egyedi, jól eltalált és kb. azonosan fontos. Fura, hogy nincs direkt szabálykönyv, csak valami betanítós küldetés révén lehet elkezdeni, vagy ha elmondja valaki. A szabály meglepően rövid egyébként.
A dobások nehezedése a sáv révén (piros kocka) szerintem nagyon jó ötlet. A fejlesztések is jók, a bázis védelme, a földrészek anyagi hozzájárulásának alakulása... Jól össze van rakva az egész, nem korszakos, de kifejezetten jó ameri játék szerintem. Még a 8 ponton is komolyan elgondolkodtam. Egy-két parti múlva az sem kizárt.

I suspect it won't get played enough.  It needs more plays to make it winnable, but the need for, ideally, 4p means we don't get it out a lot - and irregular plays won't let it shine.  Without the knowledge of the cards, the clock is always going to be hard to beat.

One of the better games I recently acquired.

Not as good as Eldritch Horror or the Legendary card games in solo mode, but almost as tense and fun.

After the initial launch and "new game" excitement, it was odd the game stayed in my closet for the next 17 months. I see the reason: set up is quite long and the game play is around 2.5 to 3 hours. 

I like luck and probability a lot in my games so if you can't cope with random results you might complain a little, but on the other side this game is fun and tense as a co op and even for us lonely riders of the storm.

The game is hard in solo mode and I still seek a first win on normal mode, but yeah: great game overall. After 6 trials I finally succeeded with a 63 VP win.

It is quite clear also that people were wrong before the game launched. The App is in no way obstructive and very well integrated with fun dice rolls and time to chat and discuss things in the resolution phase. 

Certain buy. Will never sell this game.

BGG's rating system is not based on the total quality of a game, but on how much I want to play it - and I always want to play XCOM. The time pressure of the app condenses a 3-hour game into a 1 1/2 hour experience. The game is solid, although there are deeper experiences...but nothing else in my collection delivers as much satisfaction-per-minute as XCOM.

A very good cooperative game, no time for analysis-paralysis and very well suitable combining the app with the game. Likely even more fun if you can get the app on a big screen so everyone can panic when time runs out. Seems balanced but challenging. Slightly worried about replayability, but luckily you can increase the difficulty level if this gets too easy. And the need for exactly four players is a slight negative point.

Was a little bit boring. The decisions are tactical in nature. The app introduces a time element, which I do not care about. In my opinion there was enough time to make the comparatively easy decisions, so the time thing is not really a problem. The microgames every player is occupied with are easy and not that interesting. The only problem may be the timer, but I thing there is enough time.

I’ve played the single turn demo at Essen only but have been so impressed by how thrilling, challenging and thematic - let alone frantic - Xcom is that now I’m looking forward to trying out the final game.

Before sitting at that table I was highly suspicious of integrating computers with boardgames (and still ain’t over enthusiastic about it) as mixing such different hobbies simply doesn’t feel right to me: my doubts were dispelled soon though, as the computer here is a valuable addition, by forcing players to take decisions on their own quickly and then stick to them, which contributes to create that atmosphere of impending defeat that adds so much to the theme.

By what I’ve seen, Xcom is the only game I’ve played so far where such an integration of old and new works so fine. [i](November 2014)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I’ve been playing Xcom intensively over the last months and it quickly gained ground on my favorites, finally landing at the top: it’s the ultimate thematic game, at least in the trendy and ever-expanding cooperatives family.

What makes it such an outstanding game is the way it combines straightforward mechanics that grant lots of randomness with difficult choices that impact the game severely: all of this makes for a very thematic experience, mainly thanks to the time limit, which creates that sense of urgency and impending doom that also makes Xcom’s peculiar flavor.

This is why the electronic gizmo you have to play with doesn’t take the fun from the game but on the contrary is a welcome addition: it requires the players to take decisions quickly (thus also preventing the dominant player from telling everyone else what they should do as it’s customary in most cooperatives) and stick to them, even though a moment later they realize they took the wrong one and will pay dearly for it.
The opponent being a virtual player also fits thematically: it stands for an alien, unfathomable mindset, something you can’t either understand nor outguess and hence are rightfully suspicious of. Moreover, the electronic program can also be instructed to act unpredictably, which a real player cannot despite his best efforts.

This is why I regard Xcom as a great game, one of the best I’ve ever played.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
A very unique game!  The app is no gimmick either.  If this is what the future holds for technology integration, then I am super excited to see what comes next.

Need to play normal mode, but we barely survived easy mode on our first play, so I am confident this is a tough co-op.  The roles are very unique, and this game really prevents any quarterbacking from happening.  

One thing I am worried about is replayability / expandability.  It would be cool if no 2 games ever felt the same, but even by changing out the end game mission, I am not sure how different each game will feel.  I also am curious how an expansion could ever add to the game (It's FFG though, so I am sure they already know of a way).  

Its early (very early) in 2015, but I could definitely see this one making my top 10 games of 2015.

Sin duda el mejor coop que he jugado en tiempo. Mecánicas sencillas pero decisiones tensas. Cada uno está muy especializado por lo que no hay efecto lider. La app realmente ayuda y have mejor la experiencia. Segurente un manual en papel ayuda, pero la app por si misma es una gran aportación

I hate the push-your-luck mechanic in this game, because it is so.... arbitrary and punishing. It should be more deterministic.

The hectic gameplay and quick decision making is a great bonus for me, but compared to Space Alert this loses on all fronts. You're not too connected with your group and it is soooo dry.

Initial rating, might alter as I play it more.

I like it, spot on with the theme and the app helps, making the game roll a long at a sensible rate and increase the tension with the time pressure. It isn't for everyone, not all will like being time pressured, but as it's a co-op I think it's fine (and I'd rather play games fast than watch them dissolve into AP hell anyway!).
Not totally great though - some things are a bit vague (to put it politely), just look at the volume of questions on the forum ... some of them are people not comfortable with having the rules in the app and playing the tutorial to learn it - but some aren't. When can some cards apply, timing vagueness, definition of term vagueness.
I expect it'll all be cleared up in the usual FFG FAQ - with the bonus it'll be in-APP and regularly updated :)

If the app gets updated and improved my rating will rise, like to see an expansion too (hey, it's FFG, I'm expecting one).

-- update --
Played it more, and loving it, not sure it is that good solo (there's just too much to do, it feels like a frantic day at the office) but is great 2-4 :)

Yes there's stuff I wish was a bit clearer (but it's a coop, as long as the players at the table agree how they're playing it doesn't matter) and extra stuff - but I suspect that'll all be fixed with updates/FAQ and the inevitable expansion. Currently a 9, then it'll be a 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I like the theme a lot, but the way the game splits the players into niches and ultimately plays itself out, its tense in the wrong way. By that I mean the tension comes more from managing the game rather than the experience.  If that makes sense.

RATING: 8.5
Fantastic co-op.  There is no "That Guy" in this game because you don't have time to be "That Guy".  Everyone has a unique job to do and it all comes together in a stressful, brilliant package.  Eric Lang is quickly becoming one of my favorite designers to watch.

RATING: 8.5
Best hard co-op I've played yet, might make Ghost Stories obsolete if shelf space is limited.  Can totally eliminate alpha gamer issues, IF you make sure whoever is playing communications officer isn't eating and has the tablet hidden from the rest of the table.  First play will be especially tough as players learn the cards/roles and don't talk to each other enough.  Subsequent plays will be easier as they start to share coded/vague information.

RATING: 9
Love this game.   No complaints from this guy about having to use an app.   I love the programming aspect to it.   A timed phase where you get instructions from the app, read out and instructed by the Central Officer.   

Each task that is instructed is given to one of four characters with very different roles.

The Commander deals with Crisis cards, interceptor deployment, and budget.

Chief Scientist must draw and select technology cards then assign scientists to these techs to build them.   

Squad leader deals with the actual missions that are needed to be completed by the military squad, as well as defending the base from internal alien invasions.

The Central Officer dictates what instructions the app is giving, manages where the aliens appear on the map, and deals with orbit support.

The game is a lot of fun, with great interaction, will limiting it in a way that you may not have a clue what is happening elsewhere in the game.   Make for very surprising events.

Love it, can't wait to play it again, and again.

They had me at Real Time...  Cool looks... And the computergame is really up my alley so... I have had mixed reviews on it as a solitaire though. And there seems to be a need for an app (and my phone is really old so the app is probably to modern) - hence the placement on the "want to play"-list rather than wishlist

Test run as a single player learning the game. Started out good, but took a turn on the third turn.
I crashed and burned just before I finished the game.
Think this will be good with the time aspect.

Played a two player game, and it was tense and fun. We won but  there was some mistakes done that helped us.So I think that we really lost.
Played without time limits, and the game will be harder with that aspect also. But I think that it also will be more fun.
Hopefully will play soon with four players.

A lovely adaptation of a fan favorite on the pc, this game is a great tense co-op where the app hides the strings so it really seems like you are facing a breathing foe. Great production, unique from the pc game but still right on theme. Give it a try, but don't expect to win easily.

A mechanically simple game that only works well with four players and higher difficulty levels.  It needs the higher difficulty to force people into making suboptimal decisions, otherwise the game is not that interesting to play.  It is particularly mundane as a solo game (X-Com: The Desk Job).

It is fine for what it is, but there isn't enough variety in the game to keep me interested in playing it repeatedly.  I would rather play AH/EH or Space Alert.

I really expected to hate this, as I'm generally not a fan of stuff on the more thematic end of the spectrum, but I was pleasantly surprised that XCOM was pretty much a classic resource management co-op, where the game mechanisms were as good as the theme.

The app works extremely well here, which I know some people were concerned about.  I didn't at all feel like I was playing some digital game; it felt like a board game through and through.  The app is just a facilitator that keeps the game clicking along, adding instruction, uncertainty, and time pressure, and it's an amazing facilitator at that.  I really really don't get the people that are so against this aspect.

I probably won't be picking this one up since it's not quite in my wheelhouse, but I'd very gladly play if someone wanted to.

Interesting game but I don't get all the hubbub about the reliance on the app.  This is basically a much more streamlined, and less ambitious, Space Cadets with the app timer made essential.  Core mechanisms are less interesting than Space Cadets and mainly consist of push your luck dice rolling and speed card reading/decision making.  Enjoyable though definitely and it pulls off the theme remarkably well.

It is a bit repetitive though and needs more variety long-term.

I'm pretty hesitant about Fantasy Flight games, but I'm pleased to say this is a pretty fun time. The luck factor skirts on too high for length for my taste, but honestly so far I find the game engaging enough that it doesn't bother me (we'll see if this changes with future plays).

To me, this just feels like a much more streamlined version of Space Cadets. There's still some downtime during the learning game for everyone as each person learns the ins and outs of their specific roles, but since you switch back and forth between the roles to do so it's nowhere near as bad. Also, the roles are just more standardized - you're learning different aspects of the game, but not like six different unique minigames.

That said, the learning game leaves something to be desired. I feel like Fantasy Flight was just trying to be clever by not including a paper rulebook. The tutorial works very well for learning each role and how it affects the game, but it's truly painful to have to make decisions in the timed phase without knowing how the resolution phase works at all. Going through the first "timed" phase took us an absurd amount of time, because even though we had all accepted that we'd just have to play from the gut and that we weren't going to win our first game it was just irritating and dull not to have ANY idea why we were doing the things we were doing, and if we'd had some way to skim through the phases of the game first I think that would have been a lot less painful. Plus, I have to imagine it just makes looking up rules questions etc. easier, especially as there's no search function in the app.

Once you complete the tutorial though, things go pretty smoothly. And by that I mean stressfully. Very, very stressfully. Tensions generally run as high as you would expect during the timed phase, though since everyone still completes their tasks one at a time it's not as chaotic as Space Alert or Escape. There's a little less talking between players here, but they have found some really intuitive ways for the different roles to interact so you generally want to pay attention to what everyone is doing.

But, as it goes, the turn-based resolution phase is the true meat of the game. And here is where things start to fall apart for me. The game revolves around a press-your-luck system - a mechanic I am generally a huge fan of. Though while I usually find these systems tense and exciting, here it alternates between flat and infuriating.

With most good press-your-luck games you sort of have three conceptual rolls: good rolls, bad rolls, and okay rolls. They sound the most dull, but the okay rolls are the ones that really make pushing your luck interesting and exciting. The problem with XCOM is that they simply don't exist. In a game like King of Tokyo, most of the time you start out with an okay roll and then decide whether or not trying for a GOOD roll is worth the risk of getting a bad one. XCOM's system by comparison is wholly binary - either you immediately fail, losing all units assigned to your current task (which I'm sure works as intended for balance purposes, but when you roll a fail on your first roll just feels punitive) or you make progress.

Now, the entire rest of the game is in setting yourself up to adjust these odds - but it all feels a little too safe and straightforward. Most of the true risk management comes into play with tech cards (which in themselves don't present many tough choices), so the early game where you don't have any feels pretty harsh and unforgiving. There's some minor luck mitigation you can do without them, but again, choices here tend to feel obvious... so when you fail you really feel the sting of Bad Luck.

And the final thing that feels deeply weird to me is that winning the game is directly tied to ONE person. Sure, everyone needs to be helping each other out in order to succeed, but it feels like a weird decision for a game that is supposed to be a team effort - very different from any other co-op I've ever tried.

For now, I'm happy to keep playing XCOM and seeing if the puzzle is as straightforward as it seems... but I imagine once I beat it a couple times on Normal it's not a game I will return to - unlike Space Alert or even Escape.

Once the team understands its tasks, this is a *very* fun and tense game! Initially, I'd felt the dice rolls were too punishing, but that was partly my own fault for misunderstanding a rule, and partly my own fault for obsessively keeping the board clear of enemies instead of giving the aliens a small win in exchange for keeping my resources intact. The across-the-board player exchanges during the timed phase are a blast, and I remain engaged during other people's resolution phases because their successes and failures are my own. Such a great experience that shouldn't be missed.

An incredibly fun game with 4 players! A poor nigh-on-unplayable game with any less.

When you have all the roles filled this game truly shows how great of a designer Eric Lang is, if the rest of his fantastic boardography hadn't already told you that. Distilling the feel of the strategy side of the XCOM video game series into the game as opposed to the miniatures-on-a-map experience of other Land games such as The Others really serves up an experience I will always want to return to.

Throughout my dozen or so plays (mostly on the hardest difficulty) I've had such a great time as the accountant. Oh I know, it's not really an accountant, but when light admin can feel this fun and it's smooth sailing? It really feels sort of fulfilling!

If only I wasn't limited to 2/3 players at best these days!

I'm not a huge fan of push-your-luck mechanics and I'm not exactly sure what their meaning is thematically in this game (maybe that missions are stealth-based and if you keep going, the aliens will find you and easily wipe you out? Not sure how this applies to tech research). Nonetheless, I think I had fun and I never mind a game of good old fashioned risk management, and I think that the way the roles depend on each other works rather well. I still wish the program needed to play it was more transparent.

Fun, interactive game. Each player has a different role. The iPad enhances the experience.
At the end of my 3rd play I see the rule.
-"Units assigned to Reserve, Asset or Tech cards do not count against the XCOM budget." That will make the game a little easier.
Really neat game. 
Get that tech going, it makes a huge difference. Use the workshop to get the one time use tech bonuses during the resolution phase.

Rules Notes:
-Two Types of actions in times phase. XCOM actions in Blue. Alien actions in Red.
-NEW TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE: Chief Scientist draws up to 6 Tech cards.
-BUDGET X CREDITS: Commander takes X Credits for the round.
-UFOs DETECTED: Central Officer places 1 UFO in the where shown.
-ASSIGN I,II,III RESEARCH: Chief Scientist choose 1 Tech Card from their hand and places it on an empty Research Space and assigns up to 3 Scientist tokens.
-CHOOSE MISSION: Squad Leader draws 2 Mission Cards. Choose one to place on the Mission space, the other one is discarded. And draws 1 enemy card for each blue frame on the bottom of the mission card. Place unseen, face down.
-CRISIS: Commander draws 2 Crisis Cards. Adds 1 to the Crisis pool and discards the other one.
-ENEMY IN THE BASE: Squad Leader draws 1 top card of the Enemy Deck and places it face up on an empty space in the Base.
-DEPLOY SQUAD TO MISSION: Squad Leader reveals any Enemy Cards on the Mission Card. Then places up to 4 figures from the reserve on the mission card.
-EMERGENCY FUNDING AVAILABLE: Commander takes any number of credits from the reserve and adds them to the budget.
-DEPLOY SATELLITES: Central Officer takes up to 3 Satellites and places them in Orbit.
-DEPLOY INTERCEPTORS: Commander places any number of Interceptors on the board.
-DEFEND THE BASE: Squad Leader takes any of Soldiers from the Reserves and assigns them to defend the base.

I love it when companies try to innovate and bring new experiences to the table.
Sometimes they fail, sometimes they succeed.

I always give a higher rating to those who at least tried rather than rehash the work and ideas of someone else (*cough* zombie games).

The obvious choice for the XCOM license would've been to do a tactical miniatures game. Thanks the powers-that-be they didn't do yet another one... the market's flooded with them. Instead, FFG brought us a very fresh boardgame that's unlike anything played before.

So Kudos FFG for innovating!

Now as to wether they succeeded or not with this particular game... let's say it's a very fun game and concept. I see this however as version 1.0b of a game that could grow into something much better.

Initial plays really bogged down for us, due to rules checks that completely went against the real time flow of the game. Desperately needed a rules book that can be read in advance of play.

XCOM is an ... okay game, I think. It's a coop, and I love coops. It's different from other coops, which is nice. Each player gets a unique role and responsibilities. It's different every time you play due to the randomization from the companion-App and deck shuffles.
But doesn't it annoy you to use all that space on your device for this App? Or that the person playing the App always just happens to have their battery die during the game?
What annoys me is that this game felt frustratingly difficult to predict and to beat. In one of my few plays, the person I was playing with just rage-quit by turning off their phone and walking away to start another game.

I know there have been a lot of complaints about the app being required, but it really does do things that can't be done otherwise.  Yes, you could replace a fair amount of what it does with a card deck (possibly) - but the timers simply wouldn't work, and they add a lot to the game.

My only complaint in that regard is that there doesn't seem to be a way to save the game state.  It's not really a long game, so it's not a necessity, but it would be nice.

There are a couple of points that additionally should have been in the printed "Getting Started" guide, particularly task resolution.

All that said, it's a hell of a game.  Multiple difficulty levels are a very nice touch.

But the dice rolling is a major fail that brings too much luck into the game after a lot of work, and the roles aren't equally interesting. I wanted to like this a lot more than I did.

A moderate amount of decisions but success is largely dependent on dice. Standard success of 2 sides on a d6 with a push your luck element based on a d8. The timed element is neat and the game is more complex than a lot of other casual real time cooperative games out there.

Personally wish that the board game were more complex and that it would incorporate more of a tech tree for the scientist to play with and add a tactical layer to the squad combat. Base building is absent from here.

Four characters have to play team with the task of preventing an alien invasion. Each character has its own role and tasks. The game is very different for each role.

There are two main phases: the first one is played in real time. This means that the apps requests one action to be performed by one specific player, who has to take a quick decision in a few seconds before moving on to the next task for the next player.

In the second phase of the game each player has to roll dice in a "push-your-luck" style to accomplish different tasks.

I have split feelings about this game. On the one hand, I enjoyed immensely the two introductory games I played but on the other, I tend to be a perfectionist snd it is stressing trying to make best decisions in a few seconds. 

On the other hand, that's exactly the atmosphere of the game: you have to think quickly because the aliens are attacking!

I think it is a game that has find a right group of players. Because each role is different, not all players might little all roles. 

I think I had lots of fun with this game because of the gaming group. 

I feel like playing it again but I am not sure I would like to buy myself because I don't think I would enjoy it solo and I don't think it would fit the other people I play with.

If asked to describe XCOM, I would say that it's a nice beer and pretzels coop game. While are there are definitely some decision you can make, a lot of the game comes down to the various rolls of the dice. This makes XCOM feel lighthearted and fun.

One thing that the designer Eric M. Lang really nailed is the alpha player problem that plagues so many other coops. Because every player has to manage their own area, you can't really pay to much attention to what the other players are doing and therefore it's not so easy for a player to act like the boss. This might change with experience, but until then I'll enjoy this change of pace.

To sum it up: XCOM is a nice, lighthearted coop game that I wouldn't mind playing again. If I would have to rate it after my first game, I would say that it's a solid 7.

[2015-06-11 Rating: n.a. -> 6]
XCOM is a coop I do enjoy when it hits the table, but I guess I wouldn't suggest it. There's nothing wrong with it, I'm just not thrilled with it.

Before I forget, there's one thing I really don't like: The panic tokens. Why aren't they slightly colored or something like that. The way they are and with all the time pressure in the timed phase, I find it difficult to see which token represents which continent.

I've not played the video game, so I was coming to this with fresh eyes.  Frankly, it just wasn't fun.  My main problem was that the results of the round were spit out from the app seemingly independent of what we'd done in our play.  There were never any thoughts of "man, I wish I'd done this differently", because I had no idea what effect that would have on the outcome.

Dood, I was not expecting the crazy anti-app posts.  All it is is a deck of cards for the AI and a timer.  The reason it is cool as an app is because otherwise you'd need 300 cards and ten d66 charts.  And scratchpads.  The app is a Good Thing.  My other favorite solo game is Thunderbolt Leader.  Its AI is two decks of cards, two cups of chits, and a few tables.  I'd love an app for that.

As for the game itself, it is awesome because it solves the Big Co-op Question.  How do you handle the one bossy jerk?  The game has timers for your actions, planning you need to do during other players' actions, and assets you use to help other players' actions.  So if you are blue and I'm green and you are being a jerk and telling me what to do, you are missing your chance to help red and when it is finally your turn you won't have it planned out.

First play through of Tutorial went down very well with my group (and me), score may adjust as we play more games.

App feels like a great way of replacing stacks of cards, or some other physical component, whilst also providing the timer for the timed phase, which we loved, along with the nice enhancement of music and sound effects.  It's also a fantastic tool for learning the game.

Components are at the FF standard, i.e. excellent.  The board looks busy at first glance, but doesn't take long to get used it (the most I'd possibly change it is a little prompt as to which side the roles should sit at, or at least add that to the Getting Started pamphlet).

The rush of the timed phase then the dread of the resolution was just so much fun, looking forward to beating this eventually, and with 4 levels of difficulty, could take a while to beat the hardest...

Defeated Easy comfortably first try, enough to say we're ready for Normal.  My score still holds, superb co-op game, one of my faves at the moment.

We do beat Normal, from time to time, and it feels like mostly a close thing when we do loose.

Solo play is possible and not bad (except for maybe getting round the table fast enough and having to focus on ALL roles during the timed phase), but it's not a patch on playing it with friends.

Looking forward to the expansion.

RATING: 8
The game is fun and the app is terrific. Don't let the tech luddites fool you, the app enhances the experience and streamlines a lot of mechanisms like random draws and real time events that could otherwise be cumbersome in a typical pen and paper game. I'm sure the game could theoretically be done without an app using additional random event decks or random charts and a simple timer, but why bother? The app does all that for you and does it well, it's not just a gimmick but a truly useful and fun part of the game.

One minor quibble is that, while the game isn't too difficult to understand and the tutorial is a nice way to learn it, it was a little cumbersome looking up minor technical things when I had a question. All the rules are in the app, which is fine, but they're kind of hidden in a menu and indexed in such a way that it wasn't always obvious where to look to find the answer to what I wanted. Having a paper version of the rules might have been easier to navigate in this instance.  

Other than that it's hard for me to find fault with the game. All four roles keep busy throughout the game more or less (Science drops off a bit toward the end but is still contributing) and because everybody has their own job and time is limited there's less chance for an alpha gamer to boss people around. The game set up is randomized so there's a lot of variety between games in terms of what aliens are encountered and what abilities the team has, and there are four difficulty levels (not including the tutorial) if you like making things harder or easier for your individual group.

Components are great, game is fun and doesn't overstay its welcome. Definitely recommended.

P.S. I played the video game years ago and thought it was ok, I imagine that for someone who is more familiar with the setting and such they would get additional enjoyment from seeing familiar aliens and hearing the music in the app that is taken from the video game.

RATING: 6.99
Real time cooperative game with [b]XCOM[/b] video game mechanics and theme. It's actually very well done. It's eliminating Alpha player syndrome by giving each of the 4 players a different role and putting them on the frying pan with limited time to finish all their objectives and tasks. It also requires an application, ideally on tablet plugged into the power supply in order for it to last the whole session. It's hectic, exciting and rewording at the end. It also has few different scenarios and difficulty level to stay fresh, but even with that replayability is not that high.

[b]Update:[/b] Rating modified according to a custom rating system.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Different role for each player keeping him completely busy all the time. If any of the roles fail, the whole team will probably fail too. You must cooperate all the time and be fully concentrated.

Could be the best coop i've played. Running the AI flow chart myself or getting to understand the 'event' deck is a really suspension of disbelief killer for me in coop games, hense i only really like games with a strong team panic dimension, Space Cadets for Instance. This both gives you a clock to work against and team rolls but all so hides the AI in the app and allows me to believe the game is genuinely sinister and intelligent.

On top of this the push your luck task resolution mechanics and a smart choice of research tech designs and enemy cards makes this a really decent game. Its probably most similar to Space Alert, but significantly better.

Works well with 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I am torn on how I feel about this game.  It's very much a love/hate thing, only the love/hate is coming from the same person haha

On the one hand, the game captures that feeling of hopelessness and inevitability that its inspiration delivers (if you play it correctly on Classic Ironman mode, of course), fully complemented - not distracted - by the companion app.  Like Space Alert or Escape, the app provides for a lot of exciting, tense action on the board with everyone loudly barking at each other to get things done.  Up until the resolution phase, everyone is involved, even when not performing actions, because you really have little time to put any kind of decent plan together based on what is hitting the board in the few minutes the timer ticks down.  Each player has a very specific role and communication is key to ensure that, for example, the commander is prepping the team for what's coming, the finance guy is making sure nobody's overspending, the science guy is announcing upcoming research and the military guy is not only defending the base, but ensuring he can take advantage of any upcoming tech.  What it boils down to is that the key to winning is ensuring the science officer can do his job and do it well - without tech, just like in the video game, XCOM is destined to fail.

On the other hand, however, resolution comes in the form of a threat level and dice that have a 2-in-6 chance of giving you a much-needed success result, but the price of failure is extremely high.  Committing more resources to any one task allows you to roll more dice, but each time you roll, the threat level increases; along with your success/fail rolls, you must also roll a d8 and if it is equal to or less than the threat level, -everything- you have committed dies or becomes useless, whether it's your satellites, scientists, or worse, your soldiers and interceptors (planes).  In short, this game is brutal and is extremely dependent on your luck, of which I personally have none when it comes to dice.

After a few plays, we agreed that it would have been nice if the game used colored dice with better odds on them, or perhaps at least one extra set of dice with a 50/50 chance, like in Descent or New Dawn.  There's no knowing if doing so would throw the game completely out of whack, but it was clear that the techs didn't come out fast enough for us to mitigate any bad rolls; couple this with the 'random' crisis deck draws, which can and will seriously hamper your already-slim chances of success, and you're just in a handbasket to hell.

Ultimately, the game is fun in that co-op chaos way where if everyone at the table is enjoying the tension and chaotic nature of "oh shit" moments, then there is a lot to enjoy.  However, if you are one of those who absolutely cannot stand to lose, this game is not for you.  You will lose.  A lot.  Pretty much most of the time.  A win is a wonderful thing and the whole table will cheer on even the most minimal success rolls, but whatever strategy you've cooked up for a round, you can count on the game completely toppling it before you even get it going.

XCOM is a brutal and unforgiving co-op that, taken for what it is, can be a lot of fun, but somewhat emotionally draining.  It's like letting the most beautiful person on the planet punch you in the face on the promise that later on, you might go to bed with them.  Vulgar analogy, perhaps, but it fits.

2015-06-12 : Roll a D6. If it's a 6 you've won, otherwise you lose. There, I've saved you a lot of time you can use to play an actual game instead of this crapshoot. 
Don't believe me ? Let's do this thought experiment : eliminate the artificial stress from the game by giving you all the time you need in the timed phase, now, how much higher is the probability you'll win the game ? 5% ? 10% Ok, so now roll a D6, on a 6 you win, on a 1-4 you lose, on a 5 you can re-roll.

Played twice. It's a bit like Space Alert, in that there's a timed phase and a resolution phase, but unlike that game in what you're doing. Rather than programming your moves, you're taking your turn under a time pressure when the app tells you to. Every timed section amps up the pressure and involvement, as there's things for you to do to support the other players even when they're acting and you're not. A difficult game, but one that nails the theme. Probably best played over and over with the same group, as the game rewards familiarity and skill.

Its a bit strange as there is no rulebook only an on-app tutorial which takes you through each step of the game. Not sure how i feel about that yet. Plus the app is turquoise writing on a black background which is difficult to read!

Having said that I really like the game. Boy it is intense! You have 101 things to juggle all at the same time whilst having a very very limited budget. It feels very like the XCOM game as it is brutal. Soldiers die very easily as do your jets but the aliens keep on coming, and the panic levels rack up quickly.

I think this will take a good few plays of the tutorial to actually get the hang of turn structure before we are actually ready to play the timed version where each decision must be made within the time limit. A solid and difficult co-op that I am really looking forward to playing again and again.

EDIT: Maybe not so difficult we won with ease on our second play through :(

2017-02-05: I think this can be a fun experience but if you are a stickler to the rules (like I am) then the first few tries will be very hard.
Also I am a bit confused that in a 3 player game they recommend the person handling the app having two roles. 
I think this is a decent game but it might grow stale quite fast when the 'hectic'-mechanic starts to feel more forced than fresh.
Also, a lot of resolving by dicerolling is almost never my thing (even if it didn't bother me that much here).

The first play of the tutorial was just okay.  There was a lot going on, and we were learning what exactly we needed to do.  Ended up losing, but had an okay time.

I liked the iPad integration a lot. I wish the board game that came with it was better ;)

A couple of examples of weird design choices:
- TPK on first roll is almost irrelevant in case of satellites/scientists but game wrecking in case of soldiers/interceptors. Why?
- To promote interaction each role has a card that's useful to another role. Except in practice is much better to just hand them the card and let them do it themselves.
- One of the missions requires elite soldiers to complete. If you haven't built up to that (and you will not in your first game), it's essentially game over when you almost thought you made it. Sneaking in a nasty surprise in the final round seems to me like a bad call.

And so on. I guess the game falls in line with the typical FFG fare so I'm only half disappointed.

RATING: 5
I've had XCOM on my radar for awhile, being very impressed with the variety of Eric Lang's designs in general. I know the reviews on this one weren't universally glowing, but I knew I could go in objectively. I think most people just bashed the app integration with the sensitivity of a Luddite, honestly. Really baseless concerns. If an app can handle a game that requires overly fiddly card pulls all the time, why not use an app? Doesn't bother me, really. But at the end of the day the app is XCOM's least issue. To be blunt: this game is very boring. The roles each player is assigned are not really deep or interesting and when you simmer it down, there's a fairly interesting dice mechanic that resolves all things. But this mechanic is used in everything and it isn't interesting enough to hold the game. Thus, the app comes in as a sort of glorified timer, hoping to draw fun out of boring mechanics by making players work very fast through them and perhaps laughing at the results? But this game never tries to be intentionally hilarious, so the race to not mess anything up and survive just feels punishing and ultimately repetitive. I know I was given one of the most straightforward (boring) roles, Science Officer, but honestly I didn't see anything else going through a better experience. And my god, there's an accountant role? Counting the money all the time to make sure each round is funded properly? Where's the fun in that?! At the end of the day, I'm guessing the publisher and designer wanted to create a co-op experience where players would have to band together and effectively communicate where and when the luck of the dice rolls might unravel their plans so that players could manage for that luck. So be it. But the entire game built around that idea feels bloated, uninutitive, messy, and uninteresting. Nothing new here and nothing to discover. A disappointing shame as I thought perhaps people gave this one a bad rap due to technology fear in an analog hobby. The rabble-rousers should have complained about the actual problem: the game itself.

Novel use of the app with tight time limits and an interesting role managing the apps input to the game as commander makes this game well worth a try. However, I dont feel like it has a place in a long term collection.

My wife and I loved the game to begin with, but there isn't enough here to bring you back over time. The difficulty curve very rarely resulted in a balanced and tight game. Either we got on top of our technology early and had no issues closing out the game quickly, or some poor luck in the early game led to a slow and arduous decline to eventual loss. Losing in this game can blow the game length out well past the point where the game play has worn thin.

It was also incredibly difficult to introduce to a new group of people. The nature of the timed phases and the design of the commander role led to a situation that almost demanded quarter backing to avoid the long and unfun downward spiral. 

Donated 2017.

I feel as if I've played this more times than I have because I've watched a couple games almost in their entirety.

It's an interesting game, but not my favorite co-op. I don't have anything inherently against timed games, I love Escape!, but I don't like it as much with a more complex game like this.

RATING: 6
A solid attempt at incorporating digital elements into a board game. It lacks the tactical combat which made the XCOM video game so great. The mission base overview works well and the different roles make for a fun and exciting game.

I'm a bit disappointed how all the resolution comes to a "push your luck" finale. All the setup is great, but I wish there was more to just, do I keep going or do I stop? 

Regardless, it's a good game which works best with a full group of 4 people.

Very nice coop game. You need a smartphone or tablet to make it work though. As a coop it works because you have time constraints on the decisions you have to make, this ensures that only the person who is covering a certain role can make that call, and not one directing everybody. 

All in all a good experience that gives a good feeling of the computer game.

Eric Lang does it again. A fantastic game where you take on the resource management aspect of XCOM. I love that it's coop, I love that there are 4 specialized characters each have there own unique jobs they need to perform well in order for the group to succeed. I'm not a HUGE fan of the amount of luck required via the dice rolls, but it's a small complaint of a great game.

RATING: 7
"Aww! No success... Darn! Only one success... Fail! NOOO!!!!!!!"

This is how an entire game goes to hell in a handbasket. There are critical tasks (shooting down UFOs, base attack) and non-sritical tasks (research, missions). If the latter fail, you just don't improve the overall chances by giving yourself better options. Bad enough. 

But if you scramble three fighters against two UFOs and still roll terrible, you not only lose three fighters (meaning you need to rebuild them, which is a SLOW process), but panic in the continent rises two notches. Wait! Often times, this happens in three or more continents in the same round (with way fewer fighters per continent usually, because you have four players, each of who wants or has to spend money)! Meaning that even in the first or second round the game hits the fan so badly that you know that you'll go through the motions another three rounds before the game will be lost.

Again: whatever amazing cooperative juggling the players may do, if one of them rolls crap just a couple of times on critical rolls, it doesn't matter.

I don't mind the app (loved the idea), I don't mind the lack of rules. I DO mind the lack of a game and the fact that what is there is utterly simplistic and frustratingly luck-dependent. Any resolution is just trying to roll so-and-so many 5s and 6s on D6 before you roll a 1, a 2, a 3 ... on a D8 at the same time.  This is a high gloss way to burn a couple of hours off your hands while you could be playing an actual game.

First impression from full-game demo at BGG.con  Loved it!  Complaints or concerns about the app are unfounded.  It integrates really well with the whole game experience.  Also, one of the best co-ops in terms of allowing for individual focus and decisions (i.e., muting any tendency for alpha players) while still requiring a lot of cooperation and coordination.

RATING: 4
Not too bad, but some design choices feel forced. I have the impression that the game didn't use an app because it was necessary, but instead added mechanics to justify its inclusion. The timed phases do help in keeping the pace, but were they really needed? And is there anything else that couldn't have been done with cards?

I dislike that each player has a very specific function and does the same stuff the entire game. As the game is playable solo, this seems an artificial way to allow more players, like in those two-player conflict games that are advertised as 2-4 players ("War of the Ring", "Bioshock Infinite" etc.). Also, given that there is only one way to win, only one player has the opportunity to finish the game. I was in that role when I played and admit that I enjoyed sending troops to accomplish missions and giving the final blow. My rating might be lower if I were the player who just managed the money or the other guy who basically chose technology cards.

This still is a typical Fantasy Flight game that gives an illusion of depth via a ton of unique cards with special power text, but it doesn't feel as bloated as most of their in-house designs. I might even consider buying it to play solo, but I prefer to keep smartphones away from my tabletop gaming. The requirement to use an app ruins it for me. And the stupid decision to not include printed rules is another nail in the coffin.

Négyen az idegenek ellen avagy hogyan tanultam meg imádkozni a kockákhoz
Nem sok számítógépes játékot játszottam végig, de anno nagy hatással volt rám az UFO. Ahogy illik hajnalig képes voltam „tolni” az idegenek ellen, amíg csak nem égett a szemem.
Barátunknál szervezett egyik év végi parti keretében ismertem meg ezt a játékot és irtottuk bőszen a betolakodókat nosztalgikus gondolatokkal fűszerezve a régmúlt PC-s emlékeiből. Egy véletlen beállítási hiba folytán még „hard” szinten is nyertünk. :)
Majd lakhelyünkön is megvásárolta valaki, így már több lehetőségem volt megtapasztalni az XCOM-érzést. Sőt ez volt az első olyan játék, ahol a játékosok ellen dolgozó „keeper”, „kalandmester” helyett már egy applikáció játssza el az „ellenséget”, meglepően jól.
A játékosok célja addig túlélni, amíg megjelenik a fő küldetés, amelynek teljesítésével megnyerik a játékot. Közben több területen is küzdeni kell a behatolókkal, sőt az appnak hála még az idővel is.
A maximum 4 fő játékosnak 4 vezetőt kell irányítania, akik a (had)műveletek különböző területeit vezetik egymást segítve. Igen, a játék kooperatív, mindenki egyért, mindenki az idegenek ellen.
A Parancsnok felelős a pénzügyekért, mert a háborúhoz tudjuk, hogy 3 dolog kell: pénz, pénz és pénz. Valamint irányítja a légierőt, ami a földrészek védelmében vesz részt. Ha van geppa, lesz kutatás, utánpótlás, műholdak a bolygó védelemére, földi erő a küldetésekre és repcsik a légi uralom megtartására. Ugyanis minden forduló végén a megmaradt űrhajók emelik az adott földrész pánik szintjét, ami szintén a csapat ellen dolgozik. Sőt a Parancsnok dönt, amikor krízis fázisban a 2 felhúzott krízis lap közül kell választani, ahogy már „arkham” körökben megszoktuk, 2 rossz közül egyet.
Jobb keze a kutatás vezetője, a Főagy, aki minden fordulóban tudóscsapatával maximum 3 fejlesztést találhat fel, készíthet el, dolgozhat ki. Minden hasznos: több pénz áll a házhoz, megmenthetjük katonáinkat, extra sikereket érhetünk el, fejleszthetjük meglévő képességeinket. Extraként az elpusztított ellenség maradványait is fel tudja használni rémlaboratóriumában. A legfontosabb karakter a játék elején, fejlesztések nélkül a többiek félkarú óriások.
Bal keze a kommunikáció mestere, a Műholdas. Képes megvédeni a bolygót az űrből érkező „szemét” ellen, a Főagy fejlesztéseit kihasználva segít, ahol tud.
Ökle a földi erők vezetője, a Lövős. Különböző típusú csapataival védi bázisunkat és teljesíti a játék közben választható mellékküldetéseket, valamint feladata a fő küldetés teljesítése is (ha egyszer eljutunk odáig). Egyszerű, mint a faék, de „odaüt, ahova kőll”.
És a legfontosabb. A sikerhez kockákat kell dobnod! Amennyi erőforrást (katona, repülő, műhold, kutatószemélyzet) használsz, annyival dobsz (természetesen mind pénzbe kerül). Többször is próbálkozhatsz, amíg nem teljesíted a feladatodat vagy elbuksz. Szerencsés kezűek előnyben, „Kockaisten” szívesen fogadja amerihívői imádságait.
A játék angol nyelvű, így nem árt némi nyelvtudás. A hangulat tökéletes és igazán ez viszi el a játékot a hátán. Az Elder Sign játékhoz hasonlóan ez is egy tematikus „kockapóker” a számomra. Bármennyire kevés kockával is dobsz, sikerülhet minden, de bármennyire sok kockád is lesz, lehet kudarc a vége. Köbö „Függetlenség napja” mozifilm, ahol a lehetetlen is lehetséges (tehát lehetségtelen) és szerencsével jól odaverünk az „élieneknek”, megmentjük a világot és elégedetten dőlünk hátra karosszékünkben.
Igazi csapatjáték, megfelelő emberekkel remek móka. Savanyú arcok és euro-fan számolgatók kíméljenek.

More procedural and fiddly, less exciting and fun spinoff of Space Alert.  The app, while "innovative", was not actually fun to use.

Didn't really effectively combat the alpha gamer issue in coops either- this one could definitely be controlled by a single strong player.

Holy Mother. This game is a stressfest. It took us quite some time to set up, and then the tutorial game kicked our butts. I liked that they prep you for the madness for a couple of turns, but that part should go for a little longer. Once the actual fast-paced action-reaction portion started, we were quickly overwhelmed. We may have been trying too hard to pay attention to each other's turns instead of focusing on our own. I'm sure with a few more tries and better budget management we will get the hang of it.

I thought this would be a game I buy, play 2 times and sell away. However, playing this really got me into the game, and Morten's Unpossible Solo Challenge tricked me into trying the game solo. I found it feasible (contrary to some stuff I'd read) and very entertaining. My heart pounds fast & strong when I play - and I like this!

Have now played it with 2 and 3 players. It feels very good too!! I have to prevent myself from alpha-ing, of course,since I'm so used to solo, but that's just fine.

I have yet to play this game with 4 players as of my writing this. Pretty sure it's got to be a blast!

This game has intrigued me.  I love the PC game and was a fan of the Original along with all of the later iterations of the game so the fluff/theme is all very familiar, and having it as a board game would be fantastic. 

Add that with an innovative App that controls the Alien's side along with the timer and a bunch of other board effects and it is starting to look like a really good time.  

For those who say its not a board game because it has an App, I would say maybe its not the game for you, but I'd at least try it first before I started rating a game before its even released and throwing words around like "ABOMINATION".  We are living in a new age of technology, and there is no reason why it can't be incorporated into our boardgame hobby if it is done well and is not just a gimmick.  

I really look forward to this games release!

Accurately captures the feeling of playing XCOM: Enemy Unknown, watching your plans crumble around you. The timer system per action helps solve one of the biggest problems with Cooperative board games where one player naturally becomes the "leader" and helps direct the course of play.

The sole complaint after 6 or 7 playthroughs is that every game seems to have a pity shot at the final mission, no matter how poorly you are managing the rest of the game.

A great and unique co-op board game with a tough challenge to fend off alien invasion. This is an assymetric co-op game where each player has a different role and tasks. The high-stress and timed challenge of the first phase is great fun, led by the very immersive phone/tablet app, and the flexibility and satisfaction of the resolution phase is a great counterpoint. Captured the feel of the latest Firaxis reboot of the PC game, although I enjoy this more as the research and resource management elements are better expressed. Good sliding difficulty scale for experienced players.

Only downside - this game will require some sort of rules addendum if the mobile app ever goes out of service.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Pandemic/BSG hybrid. Lots of replay value due to the difference between all the roles, thus, I highly recommend players trying them all out. Contrary to many comments, the game does not play itself. The strategy comes from limited resources at any given time, and the players needing to agree what tasks are to be prioritized. Luck (or lack thereof) of the dice rolls during the Resolution Phase can seem arbitrary at times, but proper use of tech and Asset cards is the key to mitigating this.

Feels like like a wasted potential here because the app integration could have been so much more than just a randomiser. 

The miniatures / artwork are gorgeous and typical of Fantasy Flight's quality. The app is atmospheric if you pipe the sounds through a Bluetooth speaker with decent bass. 

However the game is so fiddly with too many cards / tokens to upkeep. The app could have done so much more such as track invading alien species, squad experience, weaponry upgrades, salvage levels etc. At present, the app is just used an event randomiser for the time-limited phase. The app does track a few things like panic levels but it could have done so much more book-keeping to yield a cleaner / faster play experience. XCOM just falls short under of the weight of card text and tokens. 

That said, there is so much potential here that one could cautiously hope for a sequel.

RATING: 9
Extremely challenging co-op that leads to fantastic high points and frustrating low points. I love the dice rolling in this one as it doesn't feel like a bad roll can ruin the game, and their are lots of ways to mitigate luck. 

Games last about 1.5 hours which is the perfect amount of time for this game.

The app works flawlessly in the game. The tutorial is very helpful and rules can be checked very easily on the app at any time during the game.

The game seems to work well at all player counts. Ive played from 2 to 4 players. It is best at 4 players but works exceptionally well at 2. Solo would be quite challenging during the times phased but seems doable.

Player roles such as pushing the app button or gathering cardboard credits in time and doing accounting.
The boardgaming equivalent of quicktime events.
It turns players into lab monkeys,more than anything else and feels like they tried to include the app for innovation's sake,which never ends up well.
See Alchemists for a boardgame that makes proper use of an application.

Seems ok, though I would prefer for the choices to decide more instead of almost completely relying on dice rolls to decide whether any of the problems can be solved.

no idea what i think after 1 play of the tutorial as the ground troups player. Playing that role was occoasionally hectic in trying to make decisions about both the mission and the base defense in a very short amount of time immediately after new cards were drawn.

Based off of the tutorial play alone, it feels like the game might just become monotonous with just making the same decisions over and over again within your own role.

I don't generally like speed games, but I do like Escape: The Curse of the Temple. I'm not sure what the difference is, but it might explain why this was okay for me in that regard for my first play. We were in training mode, so I'm not sure how it would be if you upped the effect of the time limits. I did have some periods of frustration, as I was limited in my time to make a decision even though I didn't really understand what the cards did. Familiarity would help in that regard, but I'm not sure I'll play it enough to develop that familiarity.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (March 2015)

I really like the videogame so I was expecting a lot from the boardgame. Gladly I wasn't disappointed. In a nutshell I like the game. 

The theme is great and the boardgame retains the art and feel of the videogame. I think it is best enjoyed by fans of the videogame. The components are great as is usual from FFG.

XCOM is the second game I have played that requires an app to play, and the app is very well done and works perfectly. 

The rules are simple but the gameplay is frantic (eliminating any alpha player issue) and fun. Each player plays a different role but I'm not sure if the player that holds the iPad has as much fun as the other players. I'm also not sure if I like how the game resolve successes (with a die in "push your luck" fashion). 

It is novel not only for the app, it also doesn't come with a game manual, the app explains everything. I think I like this. 

Bottom line, XCOM seems like a good game and I want to explore it further. For the time being, I enjoy it a bit more than Alchemists (had more fun) but Space Alert is still king for me in the real time CoOp category.

No "alpha player" problems of what so ever in our group. There's just no time for it :D Better yet very asymmetric roles with deep strategy each for every player. 
Huge replay value even with only 5 main missions but you have very different difficulty options to go with. You can change roles one and othervise the com and card decks will random things up so it's fresh. 
Best with 4 players who all have played at least once through the tutorial.

Absolutely plays best with 4 players, each taking on one role. I love the tension created by the app (necessary to play). Making simple choices becomes difficult when you know you have 10 seconds to pull the trigger. Everyone feels accomplished and exhausted when we finish this game and I just wish I could get 4 people together more often to play this one!

So far I've only played solo, and I think my rating reflects that. The game is brutal. And it's SO RANDOM. Usually this doesn't bother me, but in a game that relies so much on stratigic thinking and quick decisions, it really sucks that you can get blown out by a couple of lousy rolls. I need to play more, and with some other folks, but I think my rating's not gonna change much.

Fun cooperative game where the enemy is the timer.  As a fan of the IP and intrigued by the premise of a cooperative alien invasion defense game, I bought this at my local comic book store to play with friends.  My favorite aspect of the game is the uniqueness of individual roles within the XCOM command structure whereby all players must work together to coordinate funds, research, and combat operations in order to have any hope of victory.  This game also features a unique digital companion app which acts as the aliens; thus adding to the unpredictability and randomness of the invasion plan.  Another function of this app is to act as a timer for the decision making round for players which is where the real challenge of the game comes in.  For my first few games playing with friends, we had the timer off which allowed us to come up with watertight plans that even the AI couldn't ultimately best.  However, as soon as we played with the timer, we were absolutely wrecked as plans disintegrated under the pressure and squads got brutalized by alien invaders, much as in the XCOM video games.  Overall, I'd recommend this game to fans of the IP and those looking for a fun, tense cooperative strategy game.

RATING: 7.6
合作遊戲就怕太簡單，另外也怕一個人操縱全場，在這個遊戲幾乎不會有這樣的情形出現，因為角色不重疊，該負責的任務也不同，這沒辦法替對方做決定，再來APP的時間控制也讓玩家沒辦法有心思去幫別人，這樣的設計其實還蠻有趣的，另外遊戲中的判定其實還蠻難的，骰成功的機率是三分之一，但加上外星骰，自爆的機率卻是逐次上升，總之這次的過程就是大家拼了命的打飛碟的打飛碟，打外星人的打外星人，搞研究的狂研究，每次丟骰子時大家的心情都是起起落落，尤其是骰到成功的那面，所有人都會雀躍不已，因為遊戲中各部會的連結都太重要了

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players have four different roles in fighting the alien invasion. The commander controls the budget, reads the news and is responsible for global satellite defense. Another player is tasked with placing the interceptors and tracking UFOs. There’s a scientist researching improved skills and a squad leader defending the base and resolving missions. The placement parts and attacks are performed real-time while the resolution is turn-based. 

It’s a fun experience to play once but I don’t need stress when playing games. The real-time puzzles only work on limited time as they are rather simple decisions on resource allocation based on obvious necessities. The resolution part is plain push-your-luck with good rolls deciding the game. An ok game but for the rare instance where I’m looking for a real-time cooperative fix I remain with Space Alert.

Players take the role of an XCOM expert (such as commander, chief scientist, etc) and attempt to protect their base and prevent worldwide panic as aliens appear on different continents.

Overly simple game. Much of the strategy was replaced with an artificial urgency that reduces a players time to think. The game does a good job of keeping the feel of the video game, however, the requirement that an electronic device be present drops this at least 1 or 2 points. I would be resistant to even calling this a board game at this point.

Great if you also loved the computer game. A lot of features return in the board game. Success is a bit luck dependent due to many dice rolls for each action.

Requires a mobile device + app to play.

Big strength of the game is the timed phase via the app. You have no time to overthink each tactical step, and a good division of labor in the team is key.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Unbelievable hard even in the easiest setting with the possibility to pause. The dice rolls are far to luck dependent and so often cause the game to be lost because of just 5 rolls without a success in a row...

A pity, the game really has the classic XCom-Feeling in it. But compared to the video game the influence of luck is far to high...

Better with 4 players. Nearly unbeatable with less. So I would give a 8 in full games and a 6 with less players. I stick with the 8 because I tend to play only with full groups.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed my first play at the easy level although the mission we played was throwing critical events at us left and right each turn. I'm not a fan of not having a hard copy of the rules to which one can refer. The app is well put together and runs the game well and does a nice job making life chaotic and difficult when communication falters due to UFO presence in orbit.  As typical of FFG, one rolls dice for successes and is successful on 2 of 6 die faces. Tension ratchets up quickly. I do wish there was some form of game in campaign mode instead of one off games.

Games so far: One time tutorial (solo) and two times with three players (tutorial, easy mission).

Plus:
Interesting game mechanisms, well-conceived game board, app with direct access to faq, coop without alpha player possibility

Minus:
Needs at the beginning a lot of time to learn the rules correctly, best with four players/ with three ok/ with two or alone would not like to play it, it is hardly possible to win if you fail with the dice often at the beginning of the game - can be frustrating for the group

?
The tutorial was more difficult than our first mission?

RATING: 8
Cooles Spiel. Das man das Tutorial verlieren kann finde ich gerechtfertigt. Schade ist wiedermal, dass man auf Würfelergebnisse angewiesen ist... Vielleicht muss man anfangs besser forschen um an gute Karten zu kommen und nicht mehr so stark würfeln muss. Mal echt: Wir haben alle absolut mies gewürfelt... Vielleicht mal einer eine Runde super, aber sonst immer schlecht.
Nächstes mal machen wirs besser... Habe aber auch die Befürchtung, dass man das Spiel meistern kann und dann könnte es langweilig werden. Mal abwarten und spielen.

Heya, wir werden besser. Jetzt da der alte Forschungsleiter ersetzt wurde, hatten wir tatsächlich auch mal Zugang zu neuen Technologien. Leider ist unser Commander nach Cuba geflogen um dort Urlaub zu machen, mitten in einer Alien Invasion!??!??!! Naja, es sei ihr gegönnt! Aus Mangel an anderen Führungskräften haben wir unseren alten Forschungsleiter an die Spitze der Finanzen gesetzt... Er hat es auch an dieser Position geschafft uns die erforschten Technologien zu zerstören und zwar genau dann, als wir sie am dringendsten benötigten... (Arbeitet er vielleicht mit den Invasoren zusammen??).
Der Einsatzleiter hat dieses mal einen recht durchschnittlichen Job gemacht, was durchaus eine Verbesserung zur letzten Invasion darstellt.
Der Central Officer wollte recht viel tun und hatte meist die besten Ideen, wurde aber vom Commander eingeschränkt doch nur einen Verteidigungssatelliten gegen 7 UFOS ins All zu schicken.
Allgemein konnten wir nur mit Kamikazeflügen trumpfen, sowohl im All mit den Satelliten, als auch mit den Abfangjägern auf dem Planeten. Die Schutzschilde der Eindringlinge und die darunter liegende Panzerung war für unsere Raketen einfach zu stark.
Am Ende hat es leider nicht ausgereicht und wir sind wieder alle gestorben... außer ich!

Der Forschungsleiter macht Spaß. Weiss auch was ich bisschen besser spielen könnte. Aber anfangs viel Geld in Forschung stecken und gegen Ende weniger halte ich schonmal für sehr sehr gut! :). Auch die Artefakte für mehr Würfel zu nutzen ist super Sinnvoll. Gegen Mitte/Ende sollten dann mehr Forscher genutzt werden um Handkarten direkt auszuspielen.
Die anderen Spieler waren auch ganz gut. Commander halt wieder knausrig mit dem Geld, wie so ein Bettelmönch. CO mit seinen Abwrack-Satteliten... und der Einsatzleiter hat einen Top-Job gemacht... Klar, hatte er auch MEINE erforschten Waffen dabei :).
Ende des Einsatzberichtes.

Heya, das erste mal gewonnen. Eine super Partie und verdammt knapp gewesen...
Eine weitere Runde hätten wir nicht überlebt und alles hing von einem Würfelwurf am Ende ab. (Gegen diesen Feind darf nur 1 mal gewürfelt werden...). WOW krass.

Despite playing with an instructor who elected not to explain the big picture, it's easy to see how XCOM is less prone to alpha player than other co-ops. Nonetheless, dice, figs & reliance on the 98mb all score heavily against the game IMO.

Really neat concept.  I think I prefer Space Alert, though both have draw backs.  I feel like it doesn't totally eliminate the alpha player problem because so many decisions are made in the resolution stage.  Still, the real time part is a lot of fun.  Could see my rating rise with more plays.

A very, very unexpected recent favorite, I actually hadn't played XCOM until about 8 days ago and absolutely loved it. I like that everyone has different roles, and the time pressure to make decisions is absolutely amazing. I don't like that it made me practice my geography, but that's pretty much my biggest complaint. I really want to try some of the other roles at some point!

RATING: 8
Initial rating is an 8 after two plays (the first being just a learning game).  I really like this game and I think it captures the feel of a desperate struggle against an alien invasion.  The mechanics are clever and streamlined.  The app works well.  The time element is really felt in the game and affects the ability of the players to cooperate in the sense that players don't have time to fully evaluate all of the information available to make the optimum choice every time.  Because of that, players have more autonomy in their decision-making, though it's always with the intent of helping the group win the game.  It is a unique game and I am looking forward to repeated plays.  At this point I've played only with 4, and I would guess that is the best number for this game.  I can't imagine soloing it - with so many choices and variables among the four roles, I think my head would explode if I had to run all of them.

My 4 player group totally had a blast with this!  Very well done co-op with tension throughout and decisions that need to be made under tight time restrictions.  As in Pandemic, everyone has a role to play but these roles are far more dynamic.  Very thematic, too!  I've never played the video game but this definitely stands on its own.

I’m generally not a fan of co-operative type games, but so far, this one has kept me interested.  The limited time mechanic prevents one player from “power gaming” the experience and ensures that everyone stays focused on their individual objectives.

Decent cooperative game with app assistance to keep it moving along and create some tension at the same time.  I have no familiarity with the computer game, so the theme is not as effective for me as it might be.

On turn 3 of the tutorial solo.
This is tough.
Quite a few moving parts. The app is ok, quite a bit of text to read. Maybe a voice would be good but then that would cause other issues and be slow so maybe not.

Lost on turn 5

Rated 10 for countering 1's and possible future expansion purposes. I will give a more realistic rating at a later date. Press your luck mechanic and the app really add to the urgency and the tension of the game. It takes awhile to master the game and each move has to be performed flawlessly in order to mitigate the eventual bad rolls and highten the chances of winning. My favorite pure co-op game to date.

XCOM is an outstanding cooperative game that pins 4 players against invading UFOs in an intense real-time adventure. It could be defined in a way as a reactionary version of Space Alert in 90 minutes.

Huge fan of the original pc game so had to get this game - after doing my homework on youtube (reviews playthroughs etc). Game is hard to win unless on tutorial mode. Has a few mechanics some people will not like - theres a timed phased which is designed to rush people simulating panic and pressure (not good for those AP players among you). The downside is there are 4 posts to control each one having different responsiblities but each one is limited in what you can do - Can easily be played solo but requires an app on your phone or on a pc to play - Seems like a lot of negatives but i really enjoyed playing this. Again try it before you buy it

Not for me. The choices made seemed obvious, with the difficulty of the game coming from the time crunch. There wasn't much player interaction, but that might have been different with a harder difficulty setting.

I love the innovation, hybrid games might be the future for all open minded (!) board and video gamers alike.

This game is fun, but sometimes too much of a hectic frenziness. Especially when soloing.

Just a "7" :
- as there are some mechanisms missing which makes me feel to get a reward for some clever moves.
- this game is no feel of Xcom, neither the Microprose, nor the Firaxis Interpretation.
- I´m missing some more story contents which let you confidently fight to the bitter end

Interesting use of app and timer in a coop with separate roles. The coop game itself feels rather bland though and has the typical fair of a couple resources and just managing how to evenly lose them so you don't die. I don't like the idea though of some hidden algorithm determining how you do.

I didn't expect to like this much, but its a fun game.

The app is nicely done. I don't like the tutorial because it promotes reading aloud, which isn't how I learn games best. And it felt like a few things we could have looked up in an actual rulebook that the app made more difficult. Apart from that, it's neat -- and I will say that after the tutorial, our learning curve dropped almost to zero.

Playing the squad leader on tutorial and easy, I felt like my choices were generally obvious but important. Looking at the other roles they seemed similar. The line the roles walked between too fiddly and too same-y seemed solid, though, and I loved that everyone didn't have a separate set of rules to learn.

I don't love the dice luck. There are ways to mitigate it, and I suspect part of it is a learning curve thing, but it's worrisome. In a 60-minute game, maybe no biggie. But in a 60-90 minute game, it doesn't excite me.

I wouldn't choose this over other co-ops, notably Pandemic, but it's a nifty game.

Yeah, bad dice luck is an issue here. I can't control for it, particularly when it happens in round one and initiates a terrifying death spiral. Down from a 7 to to a 6 it is.

Not half as impressive as it was shaping up to be. The decisions are minimal and very shallow and are then undermined by a very dull 'roll a 5+ to succeed' mechanic. The game roles involve very little actual action and the app just kind of quietly does its thing...you just don't know exactly how much it really adds. The game feels too close to a 'normal' co-op and isn't a great innovation. 

I did enjoy the timed aspect and the random turn order and the game works fine. It's ok, but I would pick other games over it.

Although coop games are not my primary interest this game has some interesting features. The components are great (although plastic scientists and satellites would have been even better) and the iOS app works great. The timed phases are nicely stressful and there are a few interesting decisions to be made.

All that said the app doesn't do much else than what any random opponent does. This type of game has a lot in common with older solitaire games like B-17 or Raid on St Nazaire (the latter being both harder and more interesting). A big problem is that there is no individual winner.

The better Pandemic.

Same world scale tension that gets out of control, but the timed phase and the specific roles make the decision process much more interesting.

Pros : - Very exciting, with tons of interesting decisions throughout the game. The gameplay is close to the PC game in many aspects. The random elements (dice rolling and app events) add a LOT of tension.

Cons : - Being a new player playing with experienced players can be intimidating, sometimes you have to take quick decisions without being sure of the exact consequences. You don't want to be the one ruining everything.
- Only 2-4 players basically.
- I can't imagine ever playing this with a non-gamer.

Co-operative game.

Good replay value, interesting strategic and tactical choices. There's a choice of missions and thanks to getting your turn instructions from the app, they play differently every time. The lack of a rule book was irritating but Fantasy Flight Games finally released PDF reference documents. The main question is whether the app will still be available and supported in, say, ten years. ﻿

The biggest disappointment isn't the ap, it's the lackluster ways the game resolves the players actions. UFO in orbit, push your luck dice game. Global defense? The same dice game. Base defense? Missions?  Oh, the same dice game. And it's not even as fun or technical as something classic like Cant Stop or Martian Dice. No dice allocation or dice locking, just roll and hope the enemy die doesn't show a certain number.

I played the demo at BGG.CON and was intrigued.

I'm neither thrilled nor disgusted with the app, but I wonder whether it is strictly necessary. That is, is the time restriction (which isn't one, really, since you can pause) or the semi-random ordering of phases what's most important?

I mean, even under the threat of imminent alien invasion, I doubt that the president would point to someone and say, "You have five seconds to decide the budget for the Secret Laboratory What Dissects the Aliens and Makes the Sciencey Thingamadings We Shoot Back With."

Nevertheless, the demo was fun and well-taught by the lovely Ming of FFG. The four of us were entertained, and I at the very least will put this on my want list. I'd prefer to be able to play it with two, but maybe there will be a workaround for that.

*Aug 2016* Regretfully got rid of this one. I absolutely loved it with 2-4 players, but I bought it as a solo game. It's too much work as a solo game, especially with the research action and the budgeting of roles. However, add just one other person and it rocks. 

It's a fun push your luck diceroller. Takes between 1-2 hours, a party game for gamers. Just all out fun trying to work together to keep the aliens at bay. 

I would have kept it if it had seen more plays, but despite others loving it, they never seemed to want to play it (I guess they have the impression the game is too complicated and fiddly to break out.... which it most certainly is NOT). Since it wasn't seeing plays, out the door it went. But it is missed

I could easily see this going up to 9 for me and my gaming buddy Brad. The app's inclusion is far more than chrome- it manages the game in a way that keeps the focus on the tense, time-sensitive communication that needs to happen between players. I especially liked it with two players; the doubling of roles made me feel my brain was bending (in a good way) throughout the game as I struggled to keep my responsibilities straight, an experience I think would be limited in the four player game as the tasks each role must accomplish are, by necessity, quite simple.

Played the tutorial and expert and won both.  On expert, it was down to the last soldier at the last stage.  But that's also odd that you can beat it on its hardest difficulty as your second play.  I think that the timing is awesome and makes it hard for someone to quarterback this coop game.  I couldn't waste time trying to figure out the other parts but I needed to get a feel for what they were doing.  I think that the AI knows that you're about to fail and sends the final mission in before you fail so that you can fail or win on that last turn.  More plays are necessary to figure this out.  There are 2 active and 2 support roles in the game.  Know who you are playing with otherwise someone is not going to like being the scientist, which is what I played.  

Amerithrash all the way and it was fun rolling dice again since most people that I play with do worker placement mostly.  

Liked it a lot but skeptical about the AI and when it chooses its final mission.

How to pick up a glorious franchise, glue some "innovative" gizmos (like an app to make a cardboard game work), convert a strategic resource allocation game into a real-time stressful experience - plus the inevitable random dice fest.

At the end of the game, you find yourself stressed for.. what? You don't know, but the app is watching you. Laughing.

Now I'm not against technology updates: be my guest. But this is not the kind of experience I was looking for, also, despite this charming tech, it's almost unplayable solo.

It's basically a more complicated Pandemic with dice and the added app/real-time fumbling. The theme works nicely, though I'd liked it to be themed on the OG version of XCOM. The real-time fumbling adds some needed feeling of dread and urgency, and at the same time prevents overt bossing around of other players, since the time is so limited. I've played three games as the commander and one with as the scientist. The scientist & the one doing the combats SEEMED more interesting than the commander or the satellite guy, but I don't know. Maybe it'll even out.

The app seemed to work fine.

I surely would have liked the XCOM game to be more about tactical combat and base building, but maybe it's better just to take this one as a nice co-op with an added cool theme. For my tactical combat/XCOMish needs I play the cool Galaxy Defenders, but I really wish someone made an XCOM game based on basebuilding / resource management / technology tree with some kind of a world map, too... 

It's hard to say about the replayability of this one: the roles are pretty simple and you kind of exhaust them pretty quickly with repeated plays. But maybe the key is to switch often.

The only thing that keeps it from being perfect, for me, is the lack of an included printed manual on beautiful glossy paper like all my other games. It does come with a brief intro manual, but the in depth rules are all on the app.

I LOVE the stress and chaos of the timed phase and the strategy of the resolution phase. I love co-op games, and this one easily jumped to the top of my list.

The app makes it very easy to learn how to play and the app drives the stressful chaos in the timed phase, which is what makes this game special to me.

I cannot think of any negatives to this game, for me. As I play more, I may discover some and lower the rating accordingly.

RATING: 7.4
The game does a good job to mimic the essence of the videogame. It does just enough to retain the feel of UFO and XCOM, but it doesn’t fall into the error of committing too much to it, preferring instead to focus on its boardgame nature. The players take different roles, each one with their own tasks. First there’s a real time phase where the app tells you what to do, and you have to do it fast. Then you can do some minor adjustments, and you throw dice to resolve everything: science, space battles, interceptions, missions and base combat.

And what about the app? I’m not a fan of having apps in boardgames. I’m not a hater either, but I consider them an annoyance and I’d rather avoid using them. In this case, is it really necessary? Well, it is if you want to have a real time phase. The feeling of this phase is far from the tension you experience in games like Escape: The Curse of the Temple, or even RoboRally, but still it forces you to fast decisions, an ocassional mistake and rules out the leader effect.

In fact, most of the decisions are either evident or blind. The real game starts several turns into the game, when the Scientist has researched some powers and cards. But the game outcome might be decided by then.

The downside of this app telling you everything is that you don’t know what are the direct consequences of your actions/mistakes. This might be a boon for some players, but my analytic mind needs to know what can be improved and the challenge that comes with it.

The second resolution phase uses a dice rolling system with a threat dice that I really loved; it creates tense situations and meaty “push your luck” decisions. On the minus side, I had the impression that dice rolls of are more decisive than your planning.

I’m not sure about the medium term replayability of this game, but for now, I'm still willing to play this again.

Played the game once, liked it a lot. The only thing that i don't like is that it requires an app (but that's just my personal taste, since the aspect i like about boardgames is to be away from technology and have the social interaction, altough the app is very well done). I was managing the research department and it was pretty fun watching what people need and try to help them. I may change the rating if i get to play it few more times.

I like how the app solves the directorship problem, giving each player just enough time to do his own stuff, but not enough breathing space to review what other people are doing and direct them. Moving the game along at a fast clip is a great disguise for what is otherwise a pretty simple sequence of priority decisions, resolved afterwards by a push-your-luck die-rolling mechanism where each roll has an increasing chance of your not being able to use those resources/meeples next turn. Your game can swing pretty dramatically depending on whether the team gets lucky or unlucky on these in certain turns, so it may be a bit too swingy in the end. I'm also not sure that the player running the app has that interesting a time, being the school monitor and all. Still, interesting and fun enough to play, for sure.

All in all a fine realtime cooperative game. The app works just fine. The different roles feel different. But this is also a negative point because some rules are less exiting than others. I like to see some new scenarious, then this game might really take off.

RATING: 6
This is a co-operative game that is partially played with a timer. You each have a role (best played at four) and the timer tells you when you must take an action. Simply adding alien ships or embarking aliens onto your base. Then the non timed portion you fight or research. The game plays itself for the most part and all you do is add pieces to the board and roll dice. Not my idea of fun, but others enjoyed it, but will likely get old fast. The game plays with a phone app, which is fairly well done and leaves it open to add ons and improvements if well supported.

The rules are only available through the online app, making them very inconvenient to reference during game play.  After playing the tutorial, a glossary and faq are available for reference, but a hard option would be nice.

RATING: 5
XCOM is a cooperative game based on the popular alien invasion computer game.  Each player takes on a role with very different tasks, and they have to make decisions within a certain time limit.  Communication is allowed, with is good because all the roles affect one another, but the time limit constrains the amount of help other players can provide.  Many of the random factors are provided by an external app, but results are generally determined through a push-your-luck dice rolling mechanism.  While this game does well to simulate the pressure and narrow margins experienced in the computer game, I was surprised that they added a timer to the board game version of a completely turn-based computer game.  I'm neither a fan of cooperative games nor time pressure, so I didn't really enjoy this.

A thematic cooperative game, with vastly different roles for each player. Players assume completely different tasks throughout the game, not just roles with varying powers. While the game is a bit too random for me, I could recommend it.

RATING: 9
When I first read about this game I was a bit disappointed it did not have the squad level tactic gameplay to reflect the main part of the computer games (at least for me this was central to the XCOM games). Having played it I am glad they used the global approach, because this game has very unique feel and really plays very thematically and can be full co-op. If it would have been squad level tactical combat game then it would be another Descent 2.0 clone probably which does not add much to the board game scene. The realtime aspect is well done here and the app does not speak - the player who controls the app gives the commands instead. I find this approach to create a game with much more interaction and communication between players. Also the timed aspect means there is no alpha player problem - there is just enough time to manage your own responsibilities in the team (which are all unique). The dice rolling mechanic adds a lot of excitement and drama, which suits this game well.

(4 plays)  This is the most exciting fun I have had playing a co-op game.  I enjoy co-ops and have played a lot of them.  I didn't expect much here, but this one is great.  I played the researcher both games (we lost, even the tutorial) and had a blast.  I got to analyze the available tech research, evaluate our weaknesses, and (attempt to) bolster the weak positions with tech advances.  Seldom does choice of technology in any game type feel so authentic.  I'm excited to try the other roles.

In the next two games, I was the Squad Leader.  While the action that made the game so much fun did hold up - these two games were more of a miss than a hit.  As a team, I think we were competing for greatest number of ones rolled.  Regardless of any decisions you may make in this game, if you roll ones a lot, and mostly roll low overall, the team is going to lose, and lose badly.  I could still see the magic in this game, but those two plays were not very satisfying.  It may be a while before this game makes it back on the table.

This game is pretty fun. I like how it gives the group a real 'command center' type feel. I like Space Alert a bit better than this because Space Alert doesn't have the random element to conflict resolution - you can beat that game purely on practice and coordination. The dice in this game can really leave you frustrated. Notwithstanding, it's still good.

I got to play this game at my local meetup and I had a blast. We won the first game we played on easy setting but man it was already an air tight victory. Earth was about to be wiped out but we won the game on one final roll of dice. I can't imagine how normal difficulty would be like.

We had 4-players and that is the best number to play this game at. I was the Com Officer so I was in charge of the iPad and that was cool. This game works so well with the iPad app. The music is awesome too.

Games like these seriously make me doubt if I am an Americantrasher at heart. It's that good.

This makes me want to play co-ops more. But I doubt my family will play with it with me. :(

Excellent usage of an app - it provides clear information, serves as a convenient way to manage game mechanics and useful tool to track turn order and timer. All in one.
As for the game itself - tense, with little to no downtime. The pace nearly eliminates an "alpha-player" coop problem (though not entirely) and forces quick and clear communication between players. Also, while every player is a cog in an overall machine, game gives sense of importance to each of them, because each role has to cover a range of data in short time. Mechanic is solid and while complicated unerneath, the app manages the more complex details of the AI's reasoning and allows to focus on core gameplay.
Where it lacks, is a rulebook (app covers it too, but in a clumsy way, IMO), not exploiting the app's multimedia capabilities (intro movie, anyone?) and repeatability - after few games, the feeling of deja vu strucks me every now and then - but then again, every game works this way after a while.

RATING: 1
This game has no physical rulebook, and the rulebook on the tablet is written and organized like a PC DOS user's manual from 1991. This game has very simple choices for players to make that felt incredibly dull. 'Where will you deploy your planes mr. budget guy?' 'I'll deploy them to where the alien ships are'. This might have been fine because of time pressure, if ultimately what the game came down to was more than dice luck. Regardless of your task, in the resolution phase you simply roll X dice where X is the number of guys assigned, and then you get a semi-random number of re-rolls to get your success tokens out of 2 of the 6 sides on each die. I'll also say that other timed games like Escape: The Curse of the Temple, Zombie 15' and Galaxy Trucker do the timer much much better, because more than one player can see or hear the countdown. Not very interesting at all.

All the fun is found in the pressure of the timed phase. I felt that while it tires to put the tension of outcomes in resolution, it just feels a little too shallow to justify its run time. I wouldn’t seek it out, but if someone really wants to play I wouldn’t object.

This game is an interesting game that uses an app to determine the flow of the game. There are 2 phase to each turn. The first is a timed phase, where the players will have limited amount of time to perform an action, and then the second part of the round is to resolve the action taken. The game pace is fast and the time given during the timed phase requires quick thinking. This is a very hard game. A lot of it has to do with the players' die roll in order to complete an objective or fight. Overall, I really like this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A fun, tense co-op. The app simplifies some of the setup and the timed element makes the game tense while also cutting down on alpha gaming. The roles feel very different from each other and you do feel like a team, though some roles feel more important than others. The dice rolling in the resolution phase is a bit lighter and more luck-dependent than I'd like though.

For being a fairly light game, there are a lot of rules to keep track of. This is compounded by the fact that there is no rule book - it's all supposed to come from the app. Unless you all the details totally memorized, you'll have to go through tutorial mode again just to remember simple things like how many cards you draw. There really should at least be a rule summary for people who know the basics but need a reference for details.

What a strange game. 

While lots of board games can certainly be turned into a digital version, the appeal of a board game in some aspect is that it CAN be a physical version. So when part of your board game's selling point is "half of it is generated by a computer because we couldn't/didn't make it analog" it sorta sours me on it even if it is an interesting experience. I wouldn't mind playing it again (I did sorta have fun), but as far as co-op experiences go, this was very (and boy do I hate to use this word ever) ameritrashy, and that's not really something I need too much of in my board game life.

While some care has been put into some preservation of aspects from the video game (such as the aliens), the board game misses pretty much everything that made the video game so captivating. It's a chaotic mess of a game that has far too much going on and real-time integration with the app is not very fun. Fans of the video game will be disappointed, as this completely forgets a lot of its strengths.

The app-driven aspect of the game originally turned me off, but it works really well.  The game emulates the stress of XCOM incredibly well, so much so that I can rarely play two games in a row.  And the different roles are perfect within a game group - you can assign the right people to the right roles...support, alpha, fighter...etc.

This is a fun cooperative game, which follows the theme of the computer game well.  I found that some of the characters are more fun to play than others.  I liked playing the squad leader a lot.

Near the end when the game should be them most exciting, while I did a few things, I kind of just sat around and watched the others finish the game.

Good game... with an asterisk.

This is a game that plays out in two parts:
A real-time phase in which the game app orders each player in turn to take no more than 15 seconds on various role specific decisions while they flounder under pressure similar to a much more tame/boring Space Cadets round, and a resolution phase that plays like a game of Farkle - rolling dice multiple times in the hopes of doing something useful, but increasing the likelihood of it all going wrong each time you do so.

Structurally, the game holds together and is quite the experience.  But I felt like the first half of every round is purely reacting to random card draws, and the second half is just praying over random die rolls.  At no point did I feel like I had the ability to impact the game through the decisions I made, other than slight situational optimizations for the RNG gods to smile upon. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a great game, though I do recommend this for 4 people, as there can be component overload for less people. The people ranting about the app need to get over it. The app hides a vast set of rules and just lets the players play the game, which is all we want to do.

I think best to play is 4 (each have one role), as thinking for many roles at same time is really hard in short limit of action time, that game provides.
It is very tight game, stressful. One of aspects I do not like about it is real time/clock ticking, it gives me hard time to focus. On other hand that is reason I got it, so I could try something that would do this 'positive stress', time push on choice making in game.

The way each player is assigned a specific task, makes it so that everyone has something to focus on while the other players are taking their turn. i.e. if the researcher isn't looking through their tech choices, when it is their turn, they may run out of time. The training modes in the app make it super easy to learn the game.  Solo play is actually pretty good.  But it is more stressful since you'll be playing all of the characters.

This is a great game with fantastic theme and good mechanics. I think to get the most out of it you must understand the core mechanics and flow very well or it would be very frustrating as time is of the essence!

Lost of people say don't play solo; I disagree I think that once you have learned the game the single minded focus of one person makes it easier to get things done in the time limit you have BUT that being said I would only attempt this when I am in the mood for it. As good as the game is, it can be quite draining and stressful so I would never play after work for example!

The best compliment I can give this game is it is very unique. After playing so many games over the years, the unique mechanics of the app integration and the added time pressure was very compelling to me and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a challenge and something different.

RATING: 6
XCOM is an excellent proof of concept in several ways: a game with an integral companion app, a cooperative game with roles so different they don't even share components, and a game that successfully translates how it feels to play the XCOM video games (mounting panic, followed by nail-biting success or crushing defeat based on dice rolls). Even the miniatures are charming, although the board and cards are too visually busy, presumably to reuse art assets from the game.

Unfortunately, these good points are overshadowed by the ridiculous difficulty level. This is a game where you can easily fail the tutorial, and you will see it coming in slow motion for an hour but be unable to stop it because you rolled really badly on turn one. That aspect of the games - where you should just quit and start a new campaign if your first mission is a disaster - just doesn't belong in a two-hour four-player board game. So, of course, there's an expansion pack that makes the game more difficult (and even more stressful for the Commander, already the hardest job).

Everyone I've introduced this game to says, "That was fun, let's never do it again."

I prefer the puzzliness of space alert over the dice rolling of xcom, but both are solid entries into time-pressured coop. In Xcom, I like how the specialized roles are distinctive but can support each other, and how the level of interaction between players steadily increases over the game.  I'm not a huge fan of either the high variance die rolls (looking for 5's and 6's on a d6) or the luck of the draw in techs (some are much better than others).  Regardless, there are still a lot of tense moments, interesting trade-offs, and satisfying camaraderie in the face of desperation.

31-03-2015. Rated after 1 play. XCOM is one of those new app-based games. XCOM is a cooperative, with a timed and untimed phase. During the timed phase, the players who all have different roles and responsibilities try to coordinate their activities to fend of aliens. 

You have one guy in charge of orbital control and communications, one science guy who is busy developing technologies, one guy who basically manages XCOM spending and air defense and the last guy is in charge of getting missions done and protecting XCOM base. The app gives you a certain amount of time (difficulty) to make the decisions.

During the untimed phase, you have to reach X successes to develop technologies or beat your enemies. You roll a dice with 33% change of success. You may reroll your dice all you want, but interestingly, you also roll the alien die (a d8). Per roll, you increase the alien threat die. If you roll the number on that die, or lower.. you lose all resources, trops etc you have attributed to that 'quest'.

I haven't played the video games, so I cannot say if the game is thematic or not. But it's certainly an interesting, albeit quite light game. I do like it and look forward to playing it more.

There was few times that I was overwhelmed with new "data" from app that I needed to pause (easy mode) and to rethink my choices. I guess after few plays it will go smoother. Now I now how to explain rules to my colleagues (there is no rulebook! - I prefer to read from paper). I see the a lot of potential to expand game further. Shortly - great game.

Update: After more plays (2 player and 4 player) ratting stays it's a such clever game. Each alien strategy (domination, infiltration ,etc.) is very different and app always adapts its strategy according to situation on the board (panic levels, final mission reviled, any input information for app). Great, great game.

This game is hard and fun. It was nice that about mid way through the tutorial that we got the feel for the game and were able to pick up the pace (the game did go on a little long for a tutorial though). Having different roles that actually have a larger impact to gameplay is awesome. The X-Com brand feels a little forced and people expecting a board game based off of the video game will not be thrilled or wowed by it overall. The app is nice, but it would have been nice to include a hard copy of the rules to help aid players along.

Cool game! And one of the seldom cases where your team of cooperative players argue heavily from time to time, at least in my gaming group. According to the stress level that comes up within a session this is certainly clear. The components are of top quality, the app is nice but could be much better: for example with more variety in the background music/sound. I don't know the video game but I was told that this is a great implementation.

A genial conversion of the video game. The board game is not only a great game on its own, but also very cleverly incorporates a lot of details from the digital version. Either would be good enough, but getting both is wonderful for an Xcom fan who is also an avid tabletop gamer. It's such a tight design that it's even hard to imagine what FFG could add to it in the form of an expansion. The app is part of the experience and works perfectly.

Oh noes! It's the Appocalypse of board games! People crapped on this game for being app-dependent but it's actually a decent game if you can get over the luddite prejudice.

[Update]  As another mentioned, the challenge comes from the frantic pace of the game. Take that away and you have a rather hollow dice-roller.

Fantastic game. I wasn't sure I'd like it, since I don't enjoy games like Escape or Galaxy Trucker where you're under a time crunch. But the timed phase in this game is not so bad. You're all working together and can help each other freely. The game really evokes a sense of teamwork. No alpha gaming and everyone feels involved. Great game. I like it a lot more than I thought I would.

Resource management taken to an extreme, plus time limit to force you to keep up, read faster, and remove boss syndrome. Do a bunch of the same thing over and over, and chuck dice during Resolution.

As far as cooperative games go, XCOM is fantastic fun.  Add in the real-time element, cool components and a well executed companion app and you easily have an instant hit.  Everyone has their own set of powers/skills and, most importantly, responsibilities!  Although the game boils down to dice rolls (and the dice can be brutal), each individual player makes decisions on their own about their "field of expertise" and thus everyone is heavily involved and relied upon for success!

Admittedly we played only half a round until the battery faded on the only mobile phone on the table where the (buggy, and very energy consuming) app was even able to run correctly.

A társas a számítógépes játékon alapul a játékosok teljesen eltérő négy szerepbe bújva próbálják a földet támadó UFÓ-kat elintézni. Ehhez már a földkörüli pályán megpróbálják eliminálni őket, majd az egyes kontinensek fölé érkezve repülőkkel próbálják őket leszedni, majd legvégső esetben a szárazföldi erők egyes osztagai segítségével. Közben különböző fejlesztéseket végeznek, jobb eszközök bevetésére, amivel javíthatnak a teljesítményükön. A játékot egy számítógépes applikáció irányítja, mikor mit tegyünk először a felkészülési fázisban, majd a végrehajtáskor, ahogy a nagy előd Space Alertben is láthattuk már ezt. Tetszett, hogy a szerepek nagyon jól elkülönülnek, de mégis fontos az összjáték, alapvetően kütyüellenes vagyok, de itt az applikáció jól segíti a játékos és hozzáad a játékélményhez olyan tekintetben is, hogy teljes változó lesz egy-egy küldetés már csak az egyes fázisok sorrendjének váltakozása miatt is. Tetszettek a kártyák és használatuk, az egyes szerepek cselekedetei, pénzügyi helyzet menedzselése. Nem tetszett viszont, hogy a játék fix négyfős, kevesebben jóval nehezebb mivel egy embernek több szerepet is kell vinnie, így nem érdemes kevesebben játszani. A legjobban viszont a sok kockadobálás és annak óriási szerencsefaktora ront a játékon rengeteget. Sajnos azt tudom mondani, hogy a legjobb összjátékot és tervezést is simán keresztülhúzza a rossz dobásszéria és a rossz játékos is sikerre viheti a nagyon szerencsés dobás. Így viszont nehéz értékelnem a játékot, mert kicsit úgy érződik, hogy hiába a jó ötletek, mindent a szerencse dönt el. Az élmény nem volt rossz, ezért adtam végül 6-ost, de ez kicsit jószívű tőlem most.

The app is an interesting addition, but the fact that the game does not actually come with a manual is completely maddening. A tutorial is all well and good but it's not nearly as practical as a traditional manual and it doesn't cover everything. A recent play session totally bombed with a new player because it wasn't possible to check a few simple things that would have been in a traditional printed guide. Innovation is fine, but there's really no excuse for this omission and it hurts the experience.

This was OK fun for a Co-op, but on further reflection it is actually really light and while realtime alleviates alpha-dog problems, the individual roles don't have as much to do as you'd hope and it ends up still being there. Think Space Alert is less fancy, but better, in that it is quicker and is definitely not a solo experience in disguise. And I don't even enjoy Space Alert that much.

In this one the strategy is more about risk management (planning for dice rolls and where to 'tank' problems) VS Space Alert which is deterministic. Decisions outside of that rely on reading your cards quickly and picking the optimal move.

Game box says 60-120 minutes, I think 90+ minutes way too long for what this is.

A really fun co-op, no matter what role I play I really enjoy X-Com (although I may be biased given how much I love the video games.) The app is a nice addition, and while the first time we played took a few hours as we learnt all the rules, ever since we have been playing the games have been getting shorter - and each one we have won or lost by the skin of our teeth - literally pulling defeat from the jaws of victory and vice versa. The timed rounds give a sense of urgency to your decisions, and though they make for a stressful game, they also make for a really fun one too!

I love the recent incarnation of the XCOM video game series and this does an amazing job recreating that same experience as a board game.  I had some serious misgivings going into my first game, but they were all completely unfounded.  It's tense and punishing (even on easy).  You will LOATHE the alien die.  Aliens, UFOs, troops and interceptors constantly get swatted down like flies.  The tech and elite troops that you gain as the game goes on adds the perfect amount of progression.  When you finally win this game, the satisfaction you feel is wonderful.  Don't listen to the app haters, this is an amazing and unique board game experience.  You owe it to yourself to grab 3 fellow xenofiles and give it a try.

RATING: 10
After our first (learning) game we immediately wanted to play another.  Immediately after that we played another.  And another.  I've honestly never played a game with so much grab, we laughed and loved every minute, win or lose.  Everyone was rooting so hard for every dice roll.  Many co-op games can be tough to balance; more experienced players can, often with the best of intentions, sort of 'take over' less experience players moves, often there is an obviously best move, or the different roles aren't different enough.  None of these are true in XCOM; every role unique, there is simply no time for full consultation on each move, and yet every role is so important to enable and support the others.  Very rarely give a 10/10 for a game, but no hesitation at all in doing it for this one.

RATING: 8
This game which uses the popular video game license is part of the recent crop of board games that uses an integrated mobile app.  I have seen both good and bad examples of this.  I adore Alchemists and think it works wonderfully with its app but think Golem Arcana is a video game with superfluous physical components.

Fans of the video game may be expecting turn/grid-based combat but this game focuses more on the management aspects of the game.  Each player takes on one of the 4 roles in the game and each role is associated with a set of actions that player has to do from managing the budget to assigning troops to accomplish missions.  This is a timed cooperative game much like Space Alert and one of the roles is responsible for reading the information from the app to the other players which dictates how the game is played during the timed phase.  The different actions during the timed phase happen in a different order each time and aspects of those actions change each round as well, such as how much money the Commander role gets in the budget.

I love how the app works with the game.  It mixes things up each round and keeps the tension level high and players on their toes so they can never really plan too much ahead of time.  This also does a lot to eliminate the "alpha gamer" problem some players experience in cooperative games.  With just a short amount of time to take each of your actions in the timed phase players can only really worry about what their role is responsible for.

This game is tough, we actually lost the tutorial mission, and spectacularly at that.  By definition isn't a tutorial mission supposed to be a free win?  The game seems to be all about making the right sacrifices.  We tried to do too much the first game and ended up spending too much money and going broke pretty fast.  Meanwhile UFOs were blowing up our planes and we were left with no defense and no money to buy more.

Finally, the tutorial itself is a great way to learn the game as long as you enter it with the right mindset.  It introduces concepts while playing and only a little bit at a time so we had players, especially experienced gamers, wondering what everything did right away but the tutorial wasn't telling us that yet.  If you don't look at it as specifically a learning game where you don't get all the information up front then it can be frustrating.  But if you do it was a smooth process that got me completely up to speed while actually doing it and I think I would have no problem teaching this game to others now.

The components are also very good and there seems to be an okay amount of variety in the different missions, tech cards, etc.  All in all a very solid game and one that uses the integrated app "gimmick" very well.

When having a problem with the rules it's frustrating when you have to check the app and still can't find it. It's good that there are other resources (BGG, Watch It Played, etc) for rules clarifications, but it's notably cumbersome. A solid and fun game otherwise, but the over-reliance on the app for gameplay and rules (there aren't even basic rules in the box) is annoying.

Great theme play.  Will take a play or 2 to learn, but fairly easy to play. Very unforgiving game play.  Heavy luck factor.  Plays best with 2 players each playing 2 roles, since downtime is high and not much to do on your turn.  Some player interaction.  Suffers from same problem as Space Alert - need to play often or will need to relearn using intro mission.  Components are very good - mounted board, custom dice, plastic figures and somewhat durable cards.  Artwork on the board and cards is fair. No rulebook, must use tutorial on an app.  Game time feels a bit too long.

Hard to judge. We had fun playing with this, but the gameplay seemed very weak, with the app and speed element just serving to distract from how little was really going on. I would play this again (and would like to play again in other than the Coms role, which seemed like it had the least going on), but would not buy it. It also seemed to take a lot longer than appropriate for the gameplay.
The app is an oddity. While some other games have used apps to handle onerous tasks for the players (One Night Werewolf), track information between games (Galaxy Defenders), or implement innovative mechanics that would be hard to manage in a normal game (Alchemists), the app here seems to exist mostly to provide one player with onerous tasks to perform, as the coms player must effectively act as a loudspeaker for the app and engage in a lot of busywork button pushing.

The only thing that keeps it from being perfect, for me, is the lack of an included printed manual on beautiful glossy paper like all my other games. It does come with a brief intro manual, but the in depth rules are all on the app.

I LOVE the stress and chaos of the timed phase and the strategy of the resolution phase. I love co-op games, and this one easily jumped to the top of my list.

The app makes it very easy to learn how to play and the app drives the stressful chaos in the timed phase, which is what makes this game special to me.

I guess another negative is after playing it once, I don't really want to play it again.  Not only is the stress too much, it is at its core, a very simple game.  the very short time in that you have to make decisions make the game great, but simple timed stress can only last so long.

XCOM is a cooperative time based game that works in conjunction with a free downloadable app (start getting used to that).  Players each have a role in defending the world from an alien invasion.  The app randomly determines the turn order every round, so you have to be prepared at all times because you never know what might be happening next.  The game has commanders, scientists, military, finance, and more.  Working together is key, but the clock is ticking and decisions must be made quickly.  Here is the thing, I do NOT like games that use a time based mechanic to force a feeling of chaos.  However, XCOM gets it right.  Yes, there is a time limit, but the game gives you enough time between turns that if you are paying attention the time restriction shouldn't be a major issue.  It is a very enjoyable game that can be played solo, but I would recommend a full compliment of 4 players.

RATING: 9
I'm a fan of cooperative games.  Of all co-op games, this one does the best in addressing one weakness of this type of game.  I find in many co-op games, one person can dominate the play and tell everyone else what to do or formulates the plan which everyone else just follows.  In XCOM, the limited time given to make decisions limits the time you have to do anything other than focus on your role only.  I feel that in this game, each player has more of an opportunity to contribute to the success of the team than the other co-op games that I have played.  Everyone primarily focuses on their role in XCOM.

This game also moves at a fairly brisk pace.  The time limits on making your move means there is not much down time waiting for your turn to come around again.  It creates a sense of urgency and adds to the overall feel of the game.

I've played this game 3 times as of this writing.  In all 3 games that I've played, I was surprised at how little time has passed.  The last game took an hour and 45 minutes and it fell like I have been playing for over 3 hours.  There was just so much happening that it felt like more time has passed.

Innovative app usage, but there is no difficulty in decision making - the optimal play is pretty apparent.  The dice determine your fate, assuming you haven't made terribly poor decisions.  The game is too luck based, so even when you do make the right choices, you can still just lose.  As a result, the game is made artificially difficult at times - due to elements beyond the players' control.  I don't find that fun (or good design).

Co-operative game where the objective is to repel an alien invasion. Game is brutal, took about 4 games to actually win. The fact that your turn is timed adds tension as it forces you to make decisions under stress.

Take a simple push your luck game, add chrome and very slightly different rules to differentiate them (mostly chrome, little in the way of rules), add a timer so that people aren't over thinking it and then add more chrome. This should be a 5 minute game. That it's a 45 minute game is almost acceptable but there's very nearly no game here. The charm almost carries it through, but like a vapid but beautiful lover, the shallowness, cracks and flaws will show through eventually and you'll wonder what you've been doing with your life.

As far as cooperatives go, it's surprisingly exciting. But with higher player counts it gets too chaotic and alternatingly too frentic or too boring.

I'm really torn on XCOM.  I love the franchise, I love coops, and I like real time.  The app is good and I have no complaints about using apps to play board games.  I appreciate that the roles are autonomous and can't be controlled by an alpha player, but some of the roles can be really boring (cough cough communications officer).  I like the push your luck element, but I also don't like how the resolution phase is just rolling dice 50 times.  I think I would like this best as a 2 player game because one role is a bit too boring.  It's also kind of fun solo, but 4 roles is a bit much to keep track of.  I'll hold onto it for now, but wouldn't be surprised if I trade/sell it within the year.

It's next to Munchkin probably one of the games which I despise the most. It's complicated if you try to get into it and there isn't even a rulebook manual but only the app. We sit there for hours and tried to figure out how it works. The time tension is nothing for me either.

On our first run through we lost hard. Since then I call it "XTrauma".

Held back by a couple problems (no manual?), this is otherwise an excellent real-time game that does a surprisingly great job of adapting XCOM for the cardboard medium and integrating the whole thing with a digital component.

Only played solo so far, but have enjoyed the puzzle of it, and man is it HARD. I've been an XCOM fan since the very first Microsoft game in the 90's, so this tackles that itch for me well. Looking forward to getting to play it with others soon (probably just one other for now). No issues with the app at all; it's very thematic, does a great job of randomizing the missions and keeping things fresh, and I can hit the Menu button as a solo player and take all the time I need ;)

XCOM has been a lot of fun every time I've played through it. I hear the criticisms, that it basically boils down to a push-your-luck dice roller, but the fact that each player plays a different role while still working together to keep the ship afloat, really works well in our group.

Novel, decision-making experience with the guidance and timing of the app. Game lets you flail against seemingly endless challenges, and is difficult to win (preferred in a cooperative game). 
The sheer number of methods available to mitigate luck and the number of choices to where to devote resources lead to most players feeling overwhelmed, though. This is why I struggled to enjoy the game. It takes too many plays to start working effectively as a group.
Best played with 4-players, unless players are EXTREMELY well-versed in the luck mitigation techniques.

A masterpiece to me! So much fun! I love all the roles which gives it massive replay value! I love the variations between games! I love the time pressure preventing me from taking too much control of my teammates turns! It's extremely tense and interesting and there are lots of choices to be made. I love the fact that after each round you can go back and think "Damn, if only I had done this like that or had been mentally capable of also thinking about this!" - It's definitely possible to be good at this game quite quickly, but to master it! That takes so much if you have a team of good players! Love it

Note! It's definitely not for everyone! Time pressure - stress - lack of control of everything - Randomness - Don't get this if you have issues with these things.

It's rare that it happens but man I felt so energized and excited after the first game.

About [thing=163602][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=163602]XCOM[/thing] is an app driven game, using cooperation and real time as main mechanics. In [thing=163602]XCOM[/thing] players defend Earth from invaders, using soldiers to accomplish missions and defend the base, researching new technologies to use in this dire war, managing the global resources in order to keep the fight going, keeping armies and Interceptors in the battles, satellites and scientists working. All while under the pressure of time: decisions must be made fast, as the aliens are trying to break the humans defenses and the world is near total panic.

Several parts of the game, specially the time frames, order of actions and the placing of the invaders is taken care by the app. The players still make the decisions"which research to make, who many soldiers to compromise in defending the base and going in missions, where and how many Interceptors to send, and so on. The app is truly more a player aid and timer - one that keeps the game going and makes starting to play faster.

The production value is good enough: the miniatures are all well done, the graphic design and art, while far from Fantasy Flight's best, do their job just fine. The replay value is high: alongise the random nature of crisis, missions, available techs, etc, the app can change how things go, accordingly to the players success or failures, and also the game comes with different scenarios and difficulty levels.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
There are four roles in the game: Commander, Captain, Science Director and Operations Chief. In a four player game, every player gets one. With less players, some roles will be bundled together - all roles are used in every play.

The app picks a scenario and shows how to finish the set up. During the rounds, the first phase will be clocked: players will mix their actions, normally doing just a part and finishing it later: like adding enemies to attack the base, then send soldiers to fight them off. All actions have a time limit - and if not completed until the clock runs out, it can't be finished.

Once all timed actions are done, comes the resolution phase. First the crisis will be resolved. After, players check if they stayed inside their budget (everything put on the board and mission - Interceptors, scientists, satellites, soldiers - cost money). If they do, ok. If not, some problem will happen.

Then each role do their thing, usually by rolling dice: the amount of blue dice is equal to the number of scientists/satellites/Interceptors sent - for fighting, there are icons that can make the number of blue dice higher or lower, and some special abilities of the aliens will act. The blue die has 4 blank faces and 2 success faces. Alongside the blue dice is rolled a d8 - this is the aliens fighting back - the players can roll as many times the dice as they want, adding up successess, but everytime they do, the menace level increses, and if the d8 rolls equal or less the menace level, the task will and and everyone one/thing involved unavailable next round or destroyed/killed. Is possible to stop rolling, keep the successes, and finish what the player was trying in the next round - but this, of course, will more resources to be done.

For every alien remaining in attacking the base, it takes a damage. For every spaceship still in the continent, the panic in the region rises one spot. Spaceships left outside the world (that the satellites didn't dealt with) will mess the order of actions in the next round. If the base is destroyed or if the panic in two continents reach the last level, the game is over in defeat. Players win only when completing the final mission.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- How much resource to spend in every action (usually the part more discussed between players - as there more someone uses, the less the other have);
- Which techs to research;
- Which soldiers to send;
- When to proceed rolling and when to stop;
- Which crisis to pick;
- Which mission to pick;
- When use a tech or benefit.

Not all these decisions will be made by every player: only the Commander chooses crisis; only the Capitain send soldiers and chooses missions. And some decisions won't even be allowed to be made: like rolling a 1 on the d8 right in the first roll - stopping will be mandatory. Overall the game offers decisions, but not all that many, to keep the clock running and pressuring the players. The choices are usually simple, with mistakes being made due to the lack of time to make them.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Production value is quite nice;
- Replay value seems rather high;
- The app (the real time) makes the pacing quick, with little downtime;
- Has cooperation (some roles cooperate more than others), while almost preventing the alpha player problem;
- Real time.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Real time;
- It has an app - I like my games as analogical as possible;
- Playing solo isn't all that good, while managing all the four roles;
- Plenty of luck going around, to the point of frustration, as even the best plans can fall apart with a single roll;
- Failing have a snowball effect.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in [i]Independence Day[/i], if this was a series of short films, with an overall arching story - Ok, story maybe too much: overall arching resolution. And with the people on the world acting much more in line with the true: complete panic.

The real time aspect can be a turn off to many players: people usually play to relax, dial back, and not be put in a pressure environment with seconds to make decisions and then have to live with mistakes and constant failure. Even for those that do like this sort of mechanic, the level of luck involved in the game can make it pretty darn frustrating: while I know that in battle the plans only survival until the first contact, this is a game, and constant disappointment isn't a good thing for it to have.

Overall, [thing=163602]XCOM[/thing] made for an enjoyable experience: I like the options given, the possibilities around it, the pressure of time (it is there, but normally isn't all that much), and the interactions between roles. The luck do bother, but, for me, so far, it doesn't destroyed a play and was mostly even in the end. Still, [thing=163602]XCOM[/thing] have problems - isn't quite there yet in quality. Maybe in the next time. However, for the moment, is good enough.

RATING: 8
Fun and tense real time coop.  Mitigates against alpha gamer due to all doing your own thing at the same time - there is no time to instruct others!

You do need each player to know what they're doing though for it to play well - first game may be a little underwhelming.  

The scientist role is the one role where it matters a lot if you've not played the game, as you're researching tech for others to use...so you need to know how the other roles work.

Needs an app to play, and it's great.  Can be hard to clarify some instructions on it, but no more so than some rulebooks I've had.

A great game.

This game is unique and hard! The app are doing a great deal of the game, and I suggest to have a TV and a home cinema connected when you play this one. To be a nine (for my part) you need to play 4 players with a tight group liking a challenge, the pressure and the thrill of doing the most optimised decisions according to the conditions. And if you manage to win as a team, you are going to shout and celebrate. This is an evil beast to tame. Have fun. ;)

It's only flaws are finding enough XCOM fans to play with, needing a computer to play, and managing to sit around a board for 2 hours while one person yells "CRISIS!"

UPDATE: While probably unfair, I am noticing that I'm enjoying coop games less and less.  Mostly because when I play games like XCOM, Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert, etc...  I find myself constantly irritated at the other players for doing dumb things; and never finding myself NOT thinking "We'd be doing so much better if I just did everyone's role myself..."
I think these kinds of coop games would work better in a team-based system (one player plays aliens perhaps) but that's about it.

Fine?  An okay co-op where players are somewhat isolated in actions.  Difficulty scaling is a lot of 'choose thing under time pressure', which is kind of awkward when it often involves reading to even know what you're choosing between.

Fun "experience" game.

Somewhat inflated due to ignorant Luddites giving it a 1.

First impression from BGG.con demo: Lots of fun and presumed replayability is high.  Also soloable.  The app basically amounts to a combination of an intelligent Mythos deck and a timer.

Also did a great job capturing the feel of the PC game.  Great idea to make the game about the strategic portion, rather than yet another tactical squad game. (which would have been good too, but we already have plenty of those)  The push your luck dice mechanism is a great fit, as it captures the feel of success at any cost versus the risk of catastrophic failure.  And if you've played the PC game, you'll know that catastrophic failure is par for the course. (although we won our play on Easy difficulty easily -- I'll be playing this one on Hard or Expert, no doubt)

You and up to three other players are whipped around the circus ring like (poorly) trained monkeys by your overlord phone/tablet app ringmaster under constant, strict time-limit stress to prevent you from thinking too long about all those deep, tough "draw a random card" and "make a random dice roll" decisions.

The app assist is pretty cool. Learning the game is a breeze having a step by step video game style tutorial. The game itself is fun, although a lot of that is artificial from the relentless time crunch. The individual mini-games are kind of boring, so I think the game might get stale once everyone is comfortable with all the roles and no longer feel they need to rush anymore.

Of course this is Fantasy Flight, so I'm sure they will expand this thing out.

While using a smart phone during board gaming seems sacrilegious to me, it works very well in this stressful co-op game by essentially eliminating "Alpha" players or "Quarterbacking"- where one player on a co-op team calls the shots and the other players simply do as told. There is simply not enough time for players to consult- they must make their own swift, rushed analyses- then act. Not a game I would want to play everyday, but great at what it does.

My second favorite cooperative game, as of the time of this writing. XCOM owes a lot of its success to the effective creation of an atmosphere of dread. See, tension is one of the defining elements of a good game for me. A game without tension is like a car without fuel. Yeah, it might look pretty, have a thumpin' sound system and maybe even the most remarkable, cutting-edge engine ever put to blueprint...but without gas, it's not going to take you anywhere.

Tension is what turns a box full of ideas and the components that represent them into an experience. An event. A game. Tension can be achieved in a number of ways. XCOM achieves it by giving the players a whole lot of things to worry about but only a few seconds at a time to act on those fears.

The players are tasked with defending Earth from an alien invasion force. UFOs will be invading international airspace or just cruise around in orbit. Alien troops will mount attacks on your HQ. Missions will demand the attention of your soldiers. Crises will appear that will threaten to undo your hard work. And atop all of this, the world will slowly begin to descend into panic.

Luckily, each player is equipped to deal with one or more of these challenges but it will take the combined efforts of the whole team to prevent disaster. The order that events occur each round is semi-random and also tailored to the particular scenario being played, so you have to be flexible in your plans. You're also on a tight budget, meaning that you'll invariably have 10 things that need to be done but can only afford to do 8 of them. Which 2 do you cut?

Of course, there's the app and it is executed wonderfully, driving the tension, making you wallow in uncertainty and creating some memorable moments. I imagine this game could have been handled with a more traditional "few decks of cards" or some degree of cross-referencing on tables but that would only bog the experience down and lose it's sense of urgency. This game works as it does precisely because of the app and it's a testament to digital integration of theme and game play. And although the app is necessary for play, it never dominates the tactile experience of the proper "board game" element. In fact, traditionally, only one person ever fiddles with the app. Everyone else is too busy trying to cram their decisions into the 15 seconds they have left before the next crisis turns everything upside down.

The result is the kind of thing that gets players jumping out of their chairs, slapping high-fives over a job well done, or smacking their foreheads in despair as 3 Interceptors get nuked by that last saucer hanging over Europe. And when it's all over, everyone wipes the sweat from their brow and leaves the table with something memorable.

Let's get it out of the way: after playing this I immediately wanted it and ended up ordering it (after attempting to trade for it). I had a lot of fun playing this and a lot of that is chalked up to feeling like you are actually you're role and not the mechanics that make up your role. I felt like I was doing good as the Chief Scientist as I provided the rest of the team with beneficial technologies. I felt like our squad leader sent soldiers to fight off the aliens. It just felt right. 

While talking about feeling right, I have to acknowledge the elephant in the room: the abstracted combat. In a world with unlimited time and interest, I think the squad combat would more closely mimic that of the XCOM video games, but the abstraction works here. If they game had that tactical combat, it would have to cost a good deal more and take considerably longer. 

I look forward to trying out the other roles and seeing how we fare.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Sci-fi co-op area defense board game based on the video game series. Each player specialist has a role to keep the human race off the extinction list by thwarting the invasion of illegal aliens.  The time phase uses an interactive computer app for real time resolution of events. The app is paused and the responses to the time phase are resolved with dice.

The app introduces; dynamic and random events that are influenced by player choices and results, it of course adds a time element for the live action phase, and it helps greatly with game management and reference.  I wondered how long it would take before we saw crossover games that become both a board game and a video game. It looks like we are there--everyone has a data phone now.

This is a dilemma for me. I know technology is better at everything but my fondness for nostalgia and human interaction with people and not interfacing with them is a huge reason why I love board gaming--To get away from technology for a couple hours each week.  I'm on the fence and torn by the inclusion of this app. So cool, but so against my gaming philosophy.

Fantasy Flight has opened Pandora's box. It was only a matter of time.

This is absolutely my favorite co-op.

It fixes the problem where the person who knows the game best can dominate the entire game, by having a time window in which everyone has to make their own decisions. At the same time, the decisions you make have a big impact on what the other people can do (scientist improves deck of the others, commander decides who has what amount of money to spend ... thus the others have to communicate on how important it is what they want to do). Plus every person can decide on their own how much they want to push their luck (but they can still take advice from the others).

I like how the difficulty scales, although we've had some games where the situation was so much under control that it was clear we couldn't really lose anymore before the game ended. I did feel the app recognized this and offered the final mission early.

I like how you can play the game 4 times and it's a different experience every time because of the distinct roles, and I also like how the app explains the game step by step.

And last but not least, I like XCOM, and I think they integrated that IP very well into this game.

Best with 4 players, but be the board of directors in the X-com video game. A pretty good mash-up of a press you luck dice rolling game and timed panic.

Not quite sure if there's a real game here tying together the four minigames unique to each player. Theme didn't catch-on among friends unfamiliar with the series.

What sounded like a good fix to the staleness that coop games bring ended up being just a convoluted mess only adding RNG to passing die rolls or not.

Very fun game but I think the four player version suffers from one role being underwhelming, the Commander. This is the only role I have seen someone feel bored with. Our best games involved 3 players (Commander and Central Officer being shared duties of one player) and 2 players (though 2 players seems to be a bit light on decision time).

5 after 1 play.

Interaction is low in this game. Indeed, the time element of it (use of app) seems to be for the purpose of forcing more interaction in an otherwise low player interaction game. The decisions don't feel particularly meaningful either. Components are of fine quality.

A good simulation of the management side of the video game. it can feel really tense and I like the way the app can easily throw loads of random events at you in a way that would be tedious to generate without it. Our track record so far looks like: 

Easy: LLLWWW 
Normal: LLWWWLLLWLWWWLLL
Hard: L

Great thematic real time game that plays good with 4 players, but I wouldn't play it with less. The time pressure when making a decision really brings about the excitement you feel during the game.

Played twice, once on easy and once on normal. I enjoyed those experiences but could see my fun diminish on future plays. 

I'm not a fan of the dice resolution but it worked well for the type of game it is.

Another broken co-op that I classify as a puzzle or a toy, not a game. Actually lacks a printed or even a pdf rulebook. No strategy or meaningful decision making involved, just reacting to the AI, which requires a lame mobile app. Make a few bad rolls with a d8 in a few critical situations and nothing else matters anymore. I give it a 2 for the lovely XCOM theme, without it this would get a 1. Aside from the theme, there's absolutely nothing to enjoy in the simplistic "game" mechanics. Will never touch this again.

I dont see too much strategy in it. There are few decisions you make, but the running time does not allow you to think a lot about it.
It s cool but it s not really my game.

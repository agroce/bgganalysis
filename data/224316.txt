A good intro to the series.  I did quite poorly though; if I recall correctly it was a combination of not fully knowing how the card system works, not finding a hidden number and getting stuck on one puzzle.

Clever little 'trial' escape room, wit h OK theme. There is enough here to be tricky and puzzley, but wanted a bit more. But for a $5 trial, it is good enough. Can't wait to try the rest of them.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2017)

I love Unlock! So it is no wonder I also like this promo adventure. It is on the easier side, but I still enjoyed it. I´m very glad BGG offered it through its store, otherwise, I would have never ever printed the cards myself. I hope they do the same for the other promo adventures.
 
Unlock! The Elite is an easy adventure, but I don’t mind much as it is a promo adventure. I still wish it was harder, but as it is harder than some regular adventures (Unlock! The House on the Hill), it is ok.

Best with 2 players.

The card size is bigger than regular Unlock, not an issue but something I noticed.

In general, I have a bittersweet feeling about the game, like T.I.M.E Stories, once you played through it, you won’t play it again because you already know the answer so it has zero replay value. At least, in Space Cowboys´ games you don’t physically destroy the game, thus preserving the resale value. That’s the only reason I bought the whole series of games while I can’t buy The Exit series of games. It isn’t about the money though, I was raised in a third world country and I was always taught that you do not waste if you can avoid it so I loathe legacy style games that destroy or permanently modify the game. To me, it is immoral and unethical to create games that are disposable (even more when the designer can easily make them resettable), even if they create a great experience. Kudos to Space Cowboys for not doing this.

[o]
We finished the scenario rather easily, but a couple of friends struggled with the color puzzle because they didn’t thought of them in English but in Spanish, it was fun to see them struggle :D. [/o]

Bottom line, Unlock! The Elite is a good introduction of the game system and a good game. I really enjoyed it and I hope I get to play the other promo adventures.

The Elite is a nice little free PnP version of the game Unlock! which lasts about 20 minutes. The theme is basic but allows users to learn the game and understand how to resolve cards for the main game.

Pretty clever. Also fairly easy, took us about 15 minutes to solve, and lots of time was spent pondering one situation where we had missed an item clearly in the room... After that it was really simple. But a good intro scenario.

Nice escape room in a box, contents don't get destroyed through playing so you can pass it on to others (unlike EXIT from Kosmos). On the other hand, the riddles in EXIT are more creative. Some visual details in Unlock are (intentionally) extremely hard to see, so bring a magnifying glass.

We missed that the yellow cards mean that you have to figure out a code and enter it into the app. It really doesn't work if you think that the answers to the yellow cards are also on a card.

Did not enjoy this. The cards I bought from BGG arrived and did not mention a quick start guide which is required. It literally says, download the app and jump straight in. Also, why would the app not have the readme files built in.

I have the "officially" produced cards. This adventure reads as a hastily thrown-together sample, and not really indicative of the cleverness of the puzzles in the commercially available adventures.

Without good puzzles, the whole system feels flat and pointless. I can't imagine anyone trying this and feeling like they should go out and buy the other Unlock adventures.

Enjoyable demo game of Unlock. Takes about 30 minutes to play. Felt that all puzzles were solvable on this one and provided a decent challenge at a solo or two player count.

Hard to rate a game which probably can't be played again in less than a decade, but Unlock! is a clever system that feels a little like TIME Stories: The Escape Room. Cards are numbered and can be turned over in various circumstances: card images (maps etc.) may show numbered locations; sometimes these are obscured in the artwork, indicating something hidden; numbers on red and blue cards can be added together to get the number for a new card showing the result (e.g. card showing key + card showing locked door).

Most of the puzzles take the form of cards requiring a 4-digit code to be entered into the companion app. This [i]could[/i] have been done with paper but the app is well done and sensible given the timer requirement.

A bit downside is that it's quite difficult for multiple people to closely scrutinize cards at the same time, so it may not be possible to solve puzzles collaboratively. My understanding is that the larger scenarios are more likely to have multiple independent puzzles which can be solved at the same time, but The Elite is more limited.

An excellent teaser and I bought the full scenarios on the strength of it.

I'm glad I got to play this as a demo to the Unlock series, because now I know that I don't need to play the Unlock series. This was not fun and it was just frustrating. The hints were largely not helpful, so when we got totally stuck on a puzzle we just had to sit there looking at the same information over and over.

The app makes loud, annoying sounds that can't be disabled. This made the experience even more frustrating as we were stuck and had to keep hearing those loud sounds as we kept trying to get hints and entering codes.

The overall system just isn't very good. You combine numbers and then look through a deck of cards to find a card with the right number on the back. So you inadvertently end up seeing the various number possibilities. This didn't have a huge impact on our game, but it's not ideal.

The only good thing is that nothing gets destroyed in this scenario, so you can give it away or sell it when you're done.

So far I like Spin Master's Escape Room Game much better. I'll have to compare the Kosmos Exit games once I play those, but they have to be better than this.

This game is a mess.  When we played Exit the puzzels that required us to grab hints or took us a while to solve it made us slap our foreheads thinking that we should have noticed some elusive element clue in question.  This one just made us scrach our head thinking 'well that was a bit of a streach.'  And the app was just confusing, took us a while to find the specific game in the nested menus and there's a button called 'machine' that we never did find out what it was for.  Ugg.  If this was supposed to make us want to buy the full games, it actually just did the opposite.

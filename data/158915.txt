i like a lot about this game: the concept, the size, the design, the production.  The "leveraged assets" concept works pretty well for this game.  There does seem to be a problem with "making sure you're on the train before it leaves the station," though.  With no catch-up mechanism, you need to play aggressively or you'll be shut out quickly.  Still a worthy game in a tiny box.

This game has some subtlety.  The dilemma of using gem cards for bidding, with the requirement that one must spend to active them again so they're worth points, leads to some interesting situations.

I played 3p. It seemed foregone at first that each player would win one gem each round - but the details of "which gem" and "for how much" proved relevant, and as it turned out I was wrong.

May be punishing to people who don't secure additional gems early, but it plays quickly enough that this may not be a problem.

If this was a full size game, it would feel like a good idea, but a half-baked one. I need to judge the game as if it was full size. Neat idea, but it needed something more. First of all the money in card form donâ€™t work, the game feels same every round and it would benefit from a board and some chips.

Seems pretty simple so far. Hard to understand where the meaningful decisions are. This is based on only one play through though and I backed the kickstarter so I will probably have a chance to get better acquainted with it.

A miniature Biblios, except that every time you spend your gems as money, you can buy them back at a discount at end of round, so your income depends on loaning out your gems as many times as possible. Rough on players who get a slow start.

Intriguing auction game that fits nicely into 30 gum-sized cards (18 + 3x4 starting money).

Replayability is an issue given there are essentially only 3 types of gem cards, but it is still an excellent game to carry around.

Pros:

Pocket sized abstract strategy game about getting the most gems using a limited number of coins and gems acquired previously.

Cons:

Tiny box implies a much more casual game than this actually is.

Quick and interesting game. If you enjoy bluffing and bidding games it'll be up your alley, and I honestly really like the fact that it's tiny.

I expected quite a bit from this one, but it ended up being a pretty bland auction game. You bid on gem cards that can also be utilized for currency, and score points based on majorities at the game's end. This gave me a similar feel to something like Medici, but Medici is vastly superior in every way. Especially with the new version, the games take up about the same amount of room.

Gem is a gem! Interesting, thinky, portable, and short auction game for 2-4 players. Well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
GEM is a super-light auction game with tiny cards intended to make the game super-portable (it's part of the pack-o-games series).  The game features a series of once-around auctions of decreasing lots of gem cards.  These gem cards provide extra auction money in future rounds if you spend current-round auction money to "activate" them, so there's a bit of chaining going on.  Scoring is based on number of gems plus points for majorities in gem types.  Like many games with once-around auctions, this one is a bit difficult to control as you don't know what the people after you will do.  The bidding also feels a little weird toward the end of rounds, where players will bid high just because they have nothing better to spend their money on.  On the whole though, this is a pretty inoffensive auction filler game.

2015: 8. First, super cute packaging and form factor, love it! Played a couple of solitaire 2p games, to get a feel for the rules and mechanics.  Very interesting game of auctioning, stocks, brinkmanship and pseudo-engine building as you leverage lower-value gems into more expensive ones.  Diamonds are more useful than I first thought!  Lots of game in a tiny package.  Impressive!

UPDATE: Have played a few games now with people, definitely a great filler, but the key to winning is subtle.  It's tricky trying to figure out the right price to bully out your opponents!

Fun, quick auction / set-collection game. You'll see every card every time, though in a completely different order. Great art, plays very quickly, and even works with just two -- winner!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each of 6 rounds, 2-4 gem cards (depending on player count) are auctioned. These show 1-2 gems (6 types in game, unequally distributed). You start with 6 money (in 1, 2, and 3 coin denomination). The auction, starting with the player to the left of the previous winner (to left of "dealer" at start), is once around. You're bidding, with your coins (and ACTIVE gems), for the right to choose a card remaining in the lot; winner takes gem, in INACTIVE state. Continue auctions until entire lot has been claimed. Then, players use remaining coins/gems to reactivate gems (costs value-1 to make a gem available to spend again). Finally end the round by, essentially, earning an income of 6 coins (max 6 coins -- so hopefully you spent all your coin money this round!); mechanically, you make your 1- 2- and 3- coin cards active again. 

In the 6th round, the gems won remain ACTIVE. 

At the end of the game, score only your ACTIVE gems:
- 1VP per gem
- for each of the 6 types of gems:
... 2VP if tied for most
... 3VP if most
Most VP wins.

Set collection game where players bid once around for gem cards using coin cards. However, gem cards are acquired with coins, then "activated" for scoring purposes using coins again. Also, activated gems may be used to bid on other gems. My favorite of the Pack o Game line of fillers.

We just found this to be a real gem, very enjoyable.

Lovely to look at, it plays very smoothly and quickly.  We played with 3 but the game length would be about the same with any player count because virtually everything the players do apart from rolling the dice can be done simultaneously. We didn't encounter any player vs player tiles which I expect would force a bit of taking turns in clockwise order from time to time.

The ship and captain wooden figures are a bit too tall and easily knocked over;  the wooden scoring disks are too big for purpose (we replaced them with cubes the same size as the pirate cubes);  and the dice have the wrong symbols on half their faces (so ignore the symbols and go solely on the colors).  But none of that detracted from the fun of the game.

For us it was a whimsical filler not taken too seriously.  The tiles might be unbalanced and if over multiple plays we found that to be the case we'd probably use some sort of tile drafting instead of the "take 2 discard 1".

Like the game, and it is very random what you can do with the game. However the plunder tiles and scheming with plunder tiles provide strategy for this game as well as a modicum of replay ability.

The mechanics work, but it's just kinda dreary, and the art isn't very inspiring. My one friend mistook the swords symbol for scissors, and yeah: one could easily retheme Dark Seas as a game about competitive seamstresses....or just about any theme you can think of!

Interesting engine building game with tile placement. Would've ranked higher but the game has several misprints including the dice. It's not a hard game to teach but new players are often confused the first couple of turns then it becomes faster.

RATING: 4
This game does many things wrong. The winner will be determined 40% on luck and 60% on skill. The best strategy is reduce luck by choosing tiles that dont involves roling dice and maximize points while avoiding the other player to do actions on your turn. The problem is that your rolls are rolled so you could end up helping your opponent more than your want to. So imagine playing san juan and choosing tre roles randomly by dice, then you can reroll once... 
The problem is that the game is to heavy and fiddly for including that high amount of luck.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Has some neat engine building aspects to it, but there is way too much downtime, even in a 2p game (I can't even imagine playing with 4!).  The attack tiles they added felt like a gimmick to add player interaction, and all it does is slow the game down since you cannot play at the same time.  The pirate artwork is nice, but since the tiles are so small, you really don't get to enjoy it much (Tiles should of been bigger).  Glad I got to try it, but overall not really something I need to play again.

A dice rolling, tile laying, score your VP type game. The crux of the game is moving your ship around six tiles, with each tile matching one side of the dice. You got to figure out how to move around clockwise on your board to activate the increasing number of tiles that you play to each of the six sections.

It's a bit solitaire, but it's a good solid "heavy filler" that plays in 30 to 45 minutes.

Aesthetics scream: 'Monkey Island'. Rulebook took a few reads to fully figure the gameplay out... love the theme, and the mechanics seem sound enough to offer an innovative take on city development... hopefully will be fun to actually play!

I like this! The theme is naet, the artwork is great and the whole tile placement mechanic - with the pirate ship and your captain playing a central role in this - is quite fun!

Place a tile or scheme it? Move your pirate or keep it on the center tile? Protect your pirates or keep your boat moving? Re-roll some of your dice to either a) improve your own chances of moving and scheming or b) try and slow your opponents down?

Another nice little game from AEG :)

I want to love this game, I mean look at the art! It's fantastic! Quality pieces too, very nice. Tiles have a sense of humour. Good! I like that in a game.
However game-play lacks player interaction, I play on my board, you play on yours with our ships sailing round and round in sad little circles like a brain dead goldfish.

Almost a 7 for me. It was engaging to play and more importantly, made me want to play it again right after. The docked score is however, is a result of printing errors, bad sized scoring discs, and a overly rushed product (though he art is top notched).

Regardless some production issues (easily fixed) - it is a very good game.
Components are nice, mechanics is neat. And it is really fun to build that "tile engine" and try to get as much as possible from it regardless the luck factor from dice.
And we still play it without errata turn suggestion, i.e. full turn one played, full turn next player (though with same dice). We think it is more fun. :)

Dreadfully random, and a bit annoying. Might be ok if you enjoy yahtzee. Theme is pasted on as the game is abstract. My impression was they did a very good job with the components and art, but reading the comments on the geek, I see many found printing errors.

I think the main improvement, and this is kind of an indictment of it, would be to shorten the game. I think games this chaotic are more fun if they're short, and if you have bad luck of your draws or rolls, you don't get too bothered by it.

A decent light euro style game. If you do simultaneous play you can knock this game out in about 35 minutes. If you watch everyone's turn like a hawk, expect it to go about an hour. Especially if you have slower players. The reason I mention this is because (and my one BIG gripe about the game) there is almost zero player interaction. My other smaller gripe is the wood pieces are of very poor quality. 3 plays and they were splintered.

Lot of fun.

Pleasant aesthetics. Lots of available actions, nice level of casuality, not particularly directly confrontational. Apt for relaxed yet decision busy play.

Unfortunately a few errors in manual and materials. Nothing really obstructing play though.

This is a fun tile/worker placement game with a pirate theme.  It gives you interesting decisions to make on your turn, but limits them based on your tiles to reduce AP.  There are a few "take that" actions but they are not dramatic nor terribly awful.

It's fun and short.  Probably a good filler game with the right crowd.

RATING: 6
Relatively light, fast playing, tile-based strategy game for 2-4. Colorful art and appealing aesthetic. Player interaction is half-baked and some options are so inefficient they're not worth performing. 

There's some unfortunate design flaws including an egregious misprinting on the dice/manual. A decent game for about $30.

Fun at first, but the lack of mitigation of dice rolls makes it have some pretty lame turns, and with so few turns it's hard to control the game. It's unfortunate, as the game wants to be strategic, but it's killed by the dice.

Well designed engine building game with dice drafting and multiple paths to victory. I get a Roll FTG mixed with Theseus and Seasons kind of vibe. Pirate theme is very pasted on, could as easily have been a city building game or similar (wish Subdivision played like this game). Production is sub par though, the scoring tokens does not fit the score board, tiles seem shrunk in production and the meeples have some imperfections to say the least. Game is still great though
Oh btw, I have only played 2p, I think more would cause way too much downtime

RATING: N/A
Played this three times and in fairness I think there might be a good game buried deep somewhere...but it needs a few more years development, a good rules editor, and some game theory.
However what was I expecting?  I mean this is an AEG game!  Did anyone expect anything but an undercooked, poor rulebook driven, joke of a mess?  AEG terrible rules started with Tomb (for me) and will probably never end unless they get new management/ownership.  I know too many people who have worked for/with/play tested for AEG and based on what I have heard AEG management doesn't seem to give a damn about proof reading, rules editing, or game balance.  In fairness, why should they, because their stuff still sells regardless of the issues. Why should AEG bother messing with a good thing?  I just won't ever buy a game from them without playing it several times first.

I've got the replacement dice from AEG.  They corrected the problem extremely quickly.  That said, it appears that they should have given this game a bit more love.  Everything is a size too small (except the dice). If the game gets the love and attention it deserves it may get a better second printing. Lets hope.

RATING: 4
Quick playing dice game with some very odd design choices. The iconography and colors of the icons on tiles not matching the iconography and colors of the icons on the dice is the oddest of them all. The scoring board on the other hand seems like it has been printed in a couple of sizes too small as a somewhat bigger and way more practical one would have fitted in the box neatly. Luck of the draw of the plunder tiles however is the main problem in the game. You either want to draw a lot of tiles with treasure chest icons or pirate icons. Not even both of them, just one type. The rest is rubbish. And it's odd that the game rewards you for not playing your tiles but instead for keeping them in hand.

Decent game, but it felt like it could use more development.
While that includes the obvious component problems, I worry more about the game balance.  Benefits and options felt largely arbitrary--especially, but not limited to plunder tile powers.  
Also, between effectively small hand size and only one reroll/turn (out of 12 total in the game), it isn't clear how much one can really influence the course of the game, or even one's own engine.

Neat game. Watch out for this designer: he has some refreshing ideas. Set collection-ish, rondel-ish, tile-laying-ish, tactical, engine-building game that plays in under an hour. Tiles have 2 uses. Multiple ways to score. 

There might be a tad too much going on for it to be a gateway game. Also, many people will say this game is too random, but I disagree with them: you can mitigate the chaos by attempting to be flexible within the 12 rounds.

This could become a contemporary family classic game. Family Game-ish. Good Beer-N-Pretzels Game !

Warning: First run editions have dice with wrong symbols. The wooden components other than the pirate cubes are a little larger for their purposes. Look at the errata.

RATING: 6
Rating is provisional - not quite sure yet. My first play was disappointing, but the second was better.

There are some component issues - a terrible score track that the scoring discs don't fit on, and the  green/purple/yellow symbols on the dice don't match the symbols on the tiles - I've posted a photo showing the mismatched symbols in the image section [UPDATE: Todd from AEG replied in the image comments to ackowledge the problem and to say that AEG will replace the dice on request]. This probably isn't a big deal for most people as the colours are a better indicator than the symbols, but it's a very obvious discrepancy and I suspect it might be annoying for colour-blind players.

The gameplay is mostly fun but too luck-based for my tastes. It's essentially based on a dice-driven rondel - you roll 4 dice which show which of the 6 port spaces around your island your ships can sail to,  effectively determining how many spaces you move and therefore how many actions you can take (once you've placed a tile at a port, you can take that tile's action every time you move to that port. Each port can accommodate 2 tiles, and apart from those allowed by the dice you can also use the port where your captain is, so on any given turn you might get anywhere from 0 to 10 actions!)

There's a bit more to it than this, but the variability in what you can achieve in a turn is enormous - in the second half of the game you can get turns where one or two players go whizzing round multiple ports getting loads of stuff, while others are stuck doing little or nothing because the dice don't work with their board position. This can be very frustrating if the dice are against you repeatedly. The game lasts exactly 12 rounds (so 12 rolls of the dice), which isn't really enough for the luck to balance out over the course of a game. 

But the art is good and there is some fun to be had with this if you go into it expecting a fairly light, swingy game, and  it plays quite quickly so I'll probably play it a few more times before deciding whether it's a keeper.

Convoluted and fiddly; random and cutthroat.  The rule book is sub-par, and the game itself is just not that fun or original.  The components are plagued with misprints, which make it difficult to explain to new players, and, despite all the flair and flash, it really comes down to a victory point race. 
That said, the art is undeniably awesome and thematic, but the game is largely devoid of any meaningful decisions, tactical richness, or even strategic possibilities.  Basically, you just react to whatever dice come up on the active player's turn, and hope for the best. Pure Ameritrash, in the worst possible way.   
Disappointing.

I thorough enjoyed the game.  There is a sense of control from the rerolls + captain (which might even be real) and an ability to build and execute a strategy over the course of the game.  Things are balanced, there are choices, there is some interaction but not enough to cause AP.

It is a light game, surely, but it hit home with me.

Components: They spent a lot of time on the art and the decided to make it all too small! Pasted on theme. The scoreboard is unusable, and tiles could easily be 10-20% larger. Dice are really nice.

The Game: Group solitaire in every sense. Outside a couple of tiles there is zero necessary player interaction. By round 6 we decided that we could take our turns simultaneously. Unfortunately a huge motivation was getting the game over with faster. The mechanics are interesting but with so many elements based on luck (dice rolls, tile draws, especially). 

Won't play again.

RATING: 8
A fun light game, with an enjoyable theme and great artwork.

The game offers interesting different strategies for points: recruiting a crew of pirates, dread ones if possible; going on a treasure hunt; seeking influential persons, such as the admiral or the governor; etc. 

All these strategies are supported by planning what to do with the tiles: laying them for plunder on future turns (thus building a resources/points generating engine)? or maximizing their scheme ability (which comes at the cost of reducing your movement)?

While there is little player interaction, downtime is fairly limited, and there is definitely some "pirate" talk between players that arise depending if the die roll advantage the player who rolled them, or certain other players.

Overall, a good mix of luck and strategy, for an easy to learn, and relatively quick to setup game.

This is a game that got taken out of the oven too soon, most likely because AEG was rushing to get it out for Tabletop Day.

First, there's a ridiculous printing error, with the rulebook and tiles showing different images than the dice that they're supposed to match up with.

Second, the game is just too long. Downtime with four players is a big issue. There's very little reason this game couldn't be tweaked to have players take their actions simultaneously, since you all work off of the same pool of dice. I would seriously recommend never playing this with three or four players, and keep it at two.

Third, the treasure tokens are a bit ridiculous. There's too many different types; it's very unlikely anyone will grab more than two of a particular type. This makes the whole action a bit frustrating.

Fourth, I can't really think of a reason not to have each player just roll dice for themselves, and just do it full out King of Tokyo style with three rolls.

Even so...I really did enjoy much of this game. I love placing out tiles, then moving your ship to activate them. When you just get that perfect roll, and kick off all of your powers, it's very satisfying. Oh, and the artwork is really phenomenal. I wish the tiles were bigger so it could show it off more.

Tough to recommend it in its current form. But I do want to try it again.

This game is pretty enjoyable on your turn if you like seeing "card combos" (in this case tile combos) happening.  That I enjoyed watching what happened on my turn as much as I did saves this from a lower rating as it feels pretty random, has remarkably few un-obvious choices (and sometimes no real choices at all depending on the die rolls) and has way too much downtime between turns.  If this played in about 20-30 minutes it would be better.  Our session strayed past the hour mark. Not something I would request... but I would try it one more time to see if its tighter when people know what they are doing ahead of time.

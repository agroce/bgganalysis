A definite improvement on the original, which was still a good game.  Reloaded polishes a lot of the rough edges from the previous game and makes for a better experience.  Still has a steep learning curve and new players tend to run head long into massive shootouts that decide the game on the first turn, which can be off-putting for some.

Theme is a ton of fun and the game looks very strategic. This is one that I really think Max could get into if we were able to play often at all.  I like the spatial aspect and, even though the learning curve has proven to be very steep, I'm interested in keepin' on.  I would really like to find someone to play this with...

Need to play more, but theme really shines and poker mechanic is cool.  Fun as a multiplayer experience.

I like the area control play and how deadly and 'stressful' gun fights are.

In multiplayer, sort of hard to tell how close someone is to winning by just looking at the board.  (Needing to count it out every action is a semi drag).

One of my players found it too stressful though.


flavor text is super fun.

Need to take some time to tweak the decks some more.

Not a fan of the game. Got a copy at Gencon, after hearing fantastic reviews of the game. When ever I've been able to play it so far there has been a winner after round 1, preventing us from going on longer and getting into some of the more interesting mechanics of the game.

RATING: 8
I was first attracted to the unique deck building challenge offered by the shootouts: should you build a deck with the best cards during the regular phase or build your deck to win shootouts?  After playing a few games with the base set, I ordered up half the expansions immediately because there's a lot more to this than just building a deck and playing it out.  There's a strong tactical/strategic play mechanic as you move your cards around the table. The theme is also very interesting--I actually found myself reading some of the stories that came with the packs.

The game's terminology makes it needlessly difficult to understand anything when you're trying to learn it. Tried to learn it a few times and kept giving up in frustration. It's now up for trade; can't be bothered to give it a try now. Having difficulties selling it for more than a year at far less than retail is perhaps an indication of how good the game is.

So another jaunt into the world of LCGs (Oops. Sorry. This isn't a Fantasy Flight Game. I meant ECG) ends in a  crash and burn. Thought maybe this might simple as you can have pre-made decks. But we just could not get into it. Never even finished a full round.

I want to play this again, but for some reason, I have a hard time making/finding opponents for two-player games.  Love the fact that a game I collected for years is finally in a box form that I can teach without worrying about the whole dead-CCG thing, to boot.

A great improvement over the CCG.  A blast to play, with a lot of tough decisions, and at times swingy combats.  Takes a few games to really get the measure of, but definitely worth it if you like card games, especially those without random expansions.

RATING: 7
I loved Doomtown. I really did. It's a fantastically interesting game of tense standoffs and difficult decisions. Every game I played came down to the wire. Unfortunately deck building an incredibly frustrating and relatively unsatisfying experience. Every card has a suit and value from a standard poker deck and challenges are resolved by drawing cards and forming a poker hand. This makes it so anytime you want to customize your deck you can't simply look at the cards and freely swap them out one-for-one, you have to constantly be aware of the total deck structure and know how each change will affect your draw structure. This makes deck modifying, and especially construction, a difficult brain twisting puzzle that is sadly not worth the payoff. I've resigned to only playing decks others have posted on DoomtownDB.

RATING: 8.6
The way the poker mechanics, tapping and other card play is woven through this game gives it a heavy injection of theme, and I enjoy that there's more than merely combat, although that is how everything tends to turn out. Establish more Control than your opponents have Influence, and win. Artwork and card stock is fine, and I like that the player boards come with it. Only issue is you might need multiple sets for 4 of each card you might wish to use, similar to the short-shrift you get in FFG Living Card Games. This seems to follow a similar sales cycle. Anyway, love the Weird West of the Deadlands RPG, and this game is a really cool way to explore it.

At the end of the nineties I had a small experience with the original CCG (it was my first CCG experience, barring a very very tiny tentative with Magic), shorty after getting my first regular job (and therefore having some money to buy cards): I was hooked by the game, but it died shortly after my falling in love with it.

This new incarnation of the game, in LCG format, is what I dreamed about: every card easily within my grasp, tweaked rules and deckbuilding! What could I want more?

Gameplay is great, shootouts based on poker hands are exciting and enticing as ever!

Just to nitpick, the only thing that got worse is the background: there are just four factions (out of the box, we'll see in the future) and I don't like the idea of a circus at all...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Doomtown Reloaded follows the same path of the LCGs published by FFG: the core set has a great deal of variety in cards, but you need more than one copy to play competitively. Well, at least with Doomtown you need just two core sets!

A small sacrifice to play this wonderful game!

RATING: 9.12
This game was a bit of a beast to learn, but was worth the effort. Dripping with theme. There are other games that I think have even better art, like Ashes, but what I love about the art in this game is that you get a real flavour of the characters. My favourite part of this game is that it's a bit chess like, where positional play is very important, but if feels very natural and NOT like I am playing chess. The chess element feels less in my face than say Summoner Wars.

Actually scratch that. For me, THE best thing, which could have been a negative, is the somewhat random combat. Absolute genius how it is resolved using poker hands, and how you can cheat or mitigate cheating, and boost your hand depending on the strength of your possee. The tension, as you gulp when you draw an okay hand having perhaps overcommmitted to the gunfight, wanting to know what hand your oppenent has. That your deck building needs to take into account how it will affect your poker hands and cheating. Love it!

For me it was a postiive that the game is now dead in terms of no more new content, as I am a bit of a completionist and knowing the full cost to get everything and that there was a decent sized card pool were big factors.

I'm not a fan of Westerns at all, but the supernatural element in this game is enticing and gives it enough of a creepy sheen to hold my interest.

Love playing this EVERY time.

Have been added to my hall of shame shelf. Probably the worst game I have ever played throughout my board gaming life. The rule book was so agonizing to read like "dude". The first phase to see who starts first has to be  5 newly drawn cards with the worst poker hand. Then upkeep phase (alright cool) then noon phase to buy cards from your hand and moving your "dudes" around and go to other player deeds to cause shootouts. And again this time you draw 5 or more poker hand but who ever has the best poker hand wins lol.

It blows my mind how well the game mechanics and theme of this game blend together. 

The more I play it the more it becomes a game of tactics, risk/reward and tough decision making. Luck still plays its roll in this game but the decisions you make will win or lose you the game.

Each session plays out differently, each telling its own thrilling western story, filled with suspense and surprising twists.

Together with Earth Reborn, this is the most thematic game I've ever played.

This game is fantastic! It's a board game played with cards. I like the dynamic nature in how you move about town to take control of the various cards which are played. Once of the other aspects I like is that, so far from what I have seen, there aren't any cards that have been replaced outright. Every card seems to be playable in some for or fashion. There are lots of different decks out there to try and new strategys to uncover. Overall this is a fantasitc game!

Doomtown Reloaded is an incredibly deep game that oozes theme. The diverse factions, the use of poker as combat resolution, and the victory conditions of the game all reflect its mashup homage to various depictions of the Wild West.

This is not a quick shoot-'em-up gunfight game, though beginning players sometimes mistake it as such -- leading to quick and bloody ends. Doomtown is strategic battle to develop and control the town while preventing others from doing the same. And there are dozens of different approaches to take in pursuing those goals.

Brilliantly designed and incredibly immersive game.

Holy this game is a beast to learn but tonnes of fun. 

update: Ultimately I find myself at odds with the ccg(or lcg or tcg or whatever) model. Having to build your decks used to be great fun for me(back in my MECCG and then Lo5R days). But in my ccg days I only played that one game. When MECCG ended I actively sought out a new game to play(and settled on the amazeballs Lo5R). Now I have a bookshelf full of games and a fairly regular group(as well as children, mortgage etc). Deckbuilders(in the classic MtG sense) only fit in certain lifestyles. It's too bad, Doomtown is awesome..

I loved the theme! I loved the person in the store selling me on it! I loved the praise from certain name reviewers! I read the instructions with my partner and-

This may have one of the single worst rule-books of all time, alongside the terrible Learn To Play guide which fails to explain several ultra important factors to new players, rendering it a guide on how to fail to Learn To Play.

After several attempts I traded this on, because every single of the half a dozen introductory plays ended within a few turns of each player flinging all cards forward because the rules suck at explaining any strategy or even the purpose of tactical adjacency. Each play was a waste of time and put another person off Doomtown: Reloaded.

I'm sure it's great but it shouldn't take a fandom to explain something that's integral to the gameplay.

God, this game is dense. There's so much to unpack, all these little tags and conditions that permeate every card. For some, it may be a strategic bonanza. For me, it's just wearying. I had a similar experience with the "Game of Thrones" LCG, but at least that theme might entice me to try again. This one isn't evocative enough for me to bother.

After the 3+ hour learning experience, my buddy and I were able to get this game going. We heard it was very difficult to learn, and it was just that. I can see why it's not popular to get people into, but I also see why those who play it absolutely love it. I have 2 base games and 1/2 of the total expansions for this game. I have several decks built out and some fun tournament accessories I grabbed off ebay to finish out the experience with.  It's definitely easier to learn and teach if you've played some other CCG/LCG's before.    The deck building aspect is like nothing else I've seen so far, focusing on building poker hands first, then filling in with good cards to play. I absolutely love the poker mechanics of all battles. As with other card games, it's fun to try and figure out combos of cards that nobody else has come up with before to best your opponents with. Because this game is out of print at the moment (soon to be back in print via another publisher) you can pickup the base game and it's expansions cheap if you look around. My LGS is practically giving the game away, so I was able to acquire most of it cheaply.

I really wanted to love this game due to theme, but it just doesn't do it for me.  The factions are all too similar.  The seemingly obvious strategy to get into gun fights is "wrong."  The rules are very fiddly.  It's a very hard game to teach someone new to play.  It seems to have been developed to call out (see what I did there) to the old players instead of starting from scratch and training new players.  Could have used some more helper text like Magic cards in the core set instead of extensive flavor text that new players don't necessarily care about (could have saved that for later).

This was fun.  I did not plan to play it or even pay attention to it.  Then it was given to me so I decided to learn how to play at GenCon.  It was a lot more fun then I thought it would be.  I'm not sure I'd buy expanions, but I enjoy what's in the box.

Reloaded is a vast improvement over the original Doomtown, the design team have done an excellent job of tweaking the cards and gameplay to streamline it, improve the flow, and remove flaws in the old game.  Really looking forward to seeing the card pool expand over time.

Excellent revision and rerelease of the Downtown classic. I fell it irons out a few wrinkles in the old version that hindered the first release. Definitely play this game 5 or 6 times before passing judgement. Some of the card placement dynamics take a while to click.

I am fascinated by this game - but don't get to play it very often. It does have a pretty high learning curve, and plenty of unique mechanics compared to other lcg's/ccgs I have tried. Understanding the rules doesn't necessarily mean you understand the game and how to play it well.  And because of that, I feel people easily gets scared away from the game.

The best LCG I've played. It's not my genre of choice but I've had fun with it. If you like LCG's I can't recommend it more highly. Much better than Android Netrunner.

Edit: Ultimately I don't like the genre of LCG's, not because of the business model, but because of the imbalances, lack of playtesting, and insufficient information to make sound tactical decisions - all flaws that would get a boardgame crucified on BGG.

LCG's are meant to be consumed fresh, half-baked or no, explored, argued about, obsessed over and then forgotten when you move on to the next one. I get that. It's just not my cup of tea. This may be the best of the bunch but it wasn't good enough for me.

Highly thematic 'Living'/expandable card game. 

What I like 

- The conflict resolution via the poker hand mechanic is unique, nails the theme and presents a challenge at both the deck-building and card play stages.

- There is a very distinct positional element to the game play - where your 'dudes' are and how you move them plays a massive part in the game - essentially it's a board game as well. In fact I would quite like to have seen minis to represent the characters at different locations so that the cards could have been kept off-board.

- Deck-building is 3-Dimensional - you can't just consider what cards will work together well in terms of play effects - you also have to consider what spread of values and likely card hands this will deliver for the poker hands.

- AEG did the base set right - provided a good spread of cards but only require the purchase of two base sets to have a complete spread of cards available. FFG - look and learn.

- Artwork is great and the card quality is very good.

The negatives - there is probably a little more luck in this than Netrunner for instance - not only do you have the luck of the cards you draw but there is also the luck in the poker hand values. E.g. one card can make the difference between two-pair and a full house which is a difference of 4 in terms of hand value. This can be mitigated but is significant when just playing with the core/base-game decks - as the card pool has grown and the options available to deck-build have increased, and experience with the game has grown, this has lessened as an issue.

A tad more complex than Netrunner and a little less intuitive than that game - can be difficult for new players to pick up the pace of the game and avoid the first/second turn all-in shoot-out. You shouldn't be going into a shootout unless you really feel you have the drop on your opponents likely posse, in terms of studs/draws or action cards in hand, unless you can afford to take the losses.

But all told a great game - has the edge over Netrunner, for me at least, in terms of 'fun'.

Doomtown: Reloaded is a constructible deck card game of area control set in the “Weird West” which employs tactical movement, multi-use cards, and poker influences. If it sound like a lot that’s because it is. Make no mistake, this game has one of the steepest learning curves of any game I’ve ever played, making most Fantasy Flight games look like Uno. It isn’t that the game is complex per se, it’s that there are so many unintuitive movement requirements and pedantic rules. It’s a bad sign when, while at Gen-Con, your game’s creative director fumbles and forgets details in explaining how to play, which is exactly what happened with Doomtown in 2014 (you can look up the Team Covenant demo in which they are guided through the game by Todd Rowland). 
	
In Doomtown: Reloaded, you take control of one of four factions seeking to establish dominance in the town. Each of the factions in the base box play very differently, though two are certainly more fitted for newcomers than the others. This is important to keep in mind as you will likely need to play through 3 or 4 times to get the feel for what you are even doing then perhaps half a dozen more to formulate strategies around which to construct your deck. This tug of war like battle ends when either player has more control tokens (given mostly by locations or “deeds”) than the other player has influence (given by characters or “dudes”). This calculation is done at the end of each round of play and serves as the backbone for most of the other mechanics in the game. Not only do characters have influence, they also have purchase and upkeep costs, a stud or draw bullet ranking for shoot outs, unique abilities, and playing card values. This game has gotten many comparisons to chess in the fact that strategy of movement is key to winning. I would like to add that like chess, Doomtown is best played cautiously, planning moves out 2 or 3 turns in advance, always predicting what your opponent will do next. Also like chess, the first couple games will probably culminate in an unnecessary and unwise bloodbath, rather than new players picking their fights carefully 

The Good: From accumulating bounties for performing criminal activities to cheatin’ poker hands and moving down the street to stop the robbery in progress, this game is just dripping with theme. The four different factions (namely The Law Dogs, the Sloane Gang, The Morgan Cattle Company, and The Fourth Ring) each play very differently from each other, occasionally even having mechanics unique to their faction. Another great thing about this game is tricking your opponent into thinking you are moving your characters one direction, only to trip him or her up when you go in an entirely different one and ambush their dude. Another great addition in the box is their step by step turn sample of The Law Dogs vs The Sloane Gang.

The Bad: Some of the terminology in this game feels like I am learning another language. It doesn’t help that there is a card pile called “Boot Hill” in addition to the action of “Booting”, though the two are not at all related. I alluded to this before, but this game is so very dense and many of the systems are unintuitive (Here’s looking at you, low-ball poker + card hands + starting posse at the beginning of the game). The game also, shockingly, did not include an index in the back of their manual. Many characters have traits printed on them such as “Huckster”, “Harrowed”, “Mad Scientist”, and “Deputy” but the book does not categorize these with anything so simple as an appendix of page numbers. I spent about 20 minutes once looking up what a word meant only to find the explanation itself to be quite vague (“Holy Ground”). I said it before but I must reiterate: This game is very slow to learn. That itself is not a bad thing, but the question we must ask is “for the amount of engagement and memorable moments that come from master level play, is it really worth it to slog through 3 or 4 hours of Greek?” The short answer: I don’t know. It honestly really depends on the persons playing and their determination. For me, though I now have a good handle on the rules, there are many other games out there that lend themselves to more engaging sessions and do not require  hours of study to understand. Additionally, there is no end game climax. By this I mean that at the end of a round the players tally each person’s control against the other’s influence if at any point one player has more control the game ends and that player wins. Routine accounting is far less exciting than something more tangible such as a rising new action or advancement of plot or even knocking an enemy’s hp down to zero. 

This is all to say that if you shy away from games in which the cards contain loads upon loads of text, you may want to run away now…..far far away. However, if multi-use cards excite you, or if you are a fan of chess, you may want to stick around and really give  Doomtown: Reloaded a chance.

This game initially seems daunting, simply because there are so many terms it's like learning a new language. But like the Anthony Burgess novel "A Clockwork Orange", stick with it long enough and all of a sudden everything becomes clear. After that initial hurdle the game itself isn't too difficult outside of teaching it to someone else, but as each card is utilised in a multitude of ways this is a deck creators dream.

Interesting LCG with a hell of a lot going on. I only had a quick demo game but I think I would need a second perhaps even third game before I really understood how exactly the game plays.

I think deck construction for this one will be really interesting when there are several packs out to expand the cardpool as you are looking to both create the best and worse poker hands that you can at certain points in the game but you still need the abilities off the cards.

The theme is not particularly appealing to me however if the gamplay is good I could overlook the theme.

I purchased this in 2014 to get a sense of its unique mechanic of building a hand of cards to resolve battles. Almost like Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage! :) 

Props to the developers for including starting decks in a preset order so you can get a feel for the game. The game still feels very fiddly for a me. After reading all of the rules there are still several cards whose text I'm unsure about. I haven't played it yet, and I don't know when I will ever be able to get a second person to experiment with. I have to play a lot of Polis first in any case!

Very good game. Dynamic and fun.

Only one minor gripe (at least for the basic pre-constructed decks): there is a little playing of locations, manouvering between them, using their abilities etc.  Violent shootouts erupt quickly and in 2-3 turns the game is over before it has a chance to blossom/develop into fully-fledged, complex affair with its subtleties and long-term plans.  Maybe it's not true for constructed decks, but we'll see.

RATING: N/A
Fairly strong theme and original for card game but some potential issues like rich get richer, luck of the draw too important (playing poker many times to decide important outcomes, you have some ability to mitigate the luck), downtime with 4. Should try first

The art to me seems good in both but I prefer the older looking not so polished art and think it evokes the theme  better (I normally don't care about art much as long as its good)

Holy crap the box is HUGE, damn. Its great they accounted for cards with sleeves, but if you are not buying the obviously 20 expansions coming down the pike then this thing is over-sized to the extreme.

We couldn't even get through the walkthrough tutorial. I've never seen a game do such a bad job of teaching you how to play it. Nothing about the card actions or movement was intuitive and the walkthrough used game-specific language to describe what you were doing without actually explaining why or how you were doing it. I was actually getting mad sitting through the walkthrough. Terrible.

Can be a bit of a swingy game. Can end pretty quickly if you invest too much into 1 shootout. The theme is great.

After a couple of plays realized why games were ending so quickly. It's best not to invest a huge amount into the first couple of firefights as they won't lose you the game if you just ignore the other player for a bit but will absolutely lose you the game on a bad poker hand.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2014)

I haven’t even heard from Doomtown before this month, but when I saw it was from AEG my interest plummeted, for some reason I don’t have much faith in their games. The theme doesn’t help it either, for me the Western theme is kind of boring. However a friend insisted we played the game and we did. Now I’m very glad I did as I really liked it.

First of all, I feel the game is for two players only, with more it becomes a random free-for-all as everyone will attack the current leader until we are all even and one wins due to luck. It also adds greatly to the playtime so I don’t think I will ever play it with 3 players. I could play it with 4 players if there were some kind of team rules but two players is definitively its sweet spot.

The game components and art are great and the gameplay is very interesting. I have always loved this kind of card game. It seems the game has its fair share of luck but I think it can be mitigated/controlled in the duels. I dislike the luck factor a lot more when it Is used to decide who should play first, however I’m not sure yet if this have a definitive impact in the game.

Doomtown has very interesting decisions each turn (should I play a Card, should I move, should I Initiate a duel, should I pass) so it is far from obvious, a very positive thing in my book. I also like the deck building aspect but currently I don’t have time to build my own deck so I will play with one from the internet.

For now I can say that Doomtown Reloaded is a very good game. I would love to buy it but I’m not sure I would play it much as it has to compete for table time with Android: Netrunner and Mage Wars (both superior games IMO), I also have other LCGs in storage to play first. Another consideration is that (obviously) many expansions will come soon and if I buy the base game I  HAVE to buy them as well. I’m still thinking about this, but for now I feel I’m going to buy it in the future. Good stuff.

Doomtown encapsulate the spaghetti western vibe like no other game I've ever played. An experience that is at first daunting soon becomes an wonderful journey into the "weird" west. 

The "weird" west atmosphere that envelopes you from the start is something that is hard to describe. The game feels like a narrative unfolding in front of you as misfits vie for control of a dirty little town. You will build attachment to your deck like no other CCG. The characters you control feel like your scummy little family (the only type of family ive ever known) The theme is rich which is back up by the western themed mechanics. The mechanisms in doomtown are  completely unique and resemble nothing like I've ever played (outside of poker). Gambling for your characters lives feels so rich and tense. It give me a warm feeling just thinking about future games. shootouts in this game feel so meaningful. The decisions so very important that one bad one might just cost you the game. At first the game felt sluggish, but that was only because I didn't know how to play a very complex game. After a few plays I was planning heists and assassinations like a boss. The game is so masterful in its design that I have to stop before I get ahead of myself. 

I can see why this game isn't for everyone. I can see why this didn't catch on like netrunner. Doomtown takes a few rough games to really appreciate. The rules were very convoluted at first. The obtuse nature of movement in this game took me for a ride. It took a few days to wrap my head around all the different elements of the game. All that aside once you get in the rhythm of the game, you can stop enjoying yourself. There is a reason for the complexity. The game is a sandbox that you can manipulate to find victory. I sold my copy of Netrunner because it just felt like a puzzle. Doomtown feels like a world on its own. A living breathing organism that sucks you away from all your other games. You become engrossed in this beautiful experience. 

While Doomtown has a few issues with accessibility. The learning curb is just a stubborn gate into a beautiful pasture full of blood crazed clowns and thieving hucksters. I think this game is a work of genius. I wish I found it earlier, but i'm just glad I got the chance to play it.

I need to play a few more times. First impressions, someone who really loved poker became board with poker and made it into an adventure game.  It's fun, but a little complex right now. For me it's the inverse: playing Doomtown makes me want to play poker. Silly situation.

One of the deepest and most tactical card games on the market, the game did not age well as more expansions came out, and many of the strongest strategies in the game really discourage some of the more fun ones. It begins to feel like very complex chess, which is great for a while, but as the cards got more complex, the game just started to fall flat. A shame though because the first few expansions were that good.

LIMITED EDITION - ALL EXPANSIONS

This game is WAY heavier than other LCG's I've played, and is definitely not a good gateway game into the category; however, it's an outstanding game for experienced gamers - maybe the best. 

Now, my favorite LCG is still Call of Cthulhu, partly because I'm a huge fan of the Mythos, but I can safely say that CoC is a suitable gateway game to introduce people to LCG's. As expansions come out for Doomtown Reloaded, it's starting to creep up towards that #1 spot, and the more I play it, the more I like it. The first game I played of it was rough. Even I, an experienced gamer, struggled with the rules. In fact, I'm still not sure I fully grasp every nuance. 

Give this game at least several tries before you judge it, because there's a huge learning curve.

[b][thing=156714][/thing][/b] has a lot going for it.  The deck-building has that extra layer of balancing the effects of the card with it's value as a standard playing card.  The area-control and movement rules also add something (although they're a bit clunky).  Unfortunately, without regular, dedicated play, I'm not sure it's worth pursuing instead of something a bit more streamlined like old [b][thing=463][/thing][/b].

area control game in under 30 minutes with a nice rating.

May not be worth having in a personal or school collection.

The theme is still as original (and odd) as many years ago.

A really random game, with poker hands as a core mechanic.  Too random for my liking.  Tried the starting decks for gunslingers and outlaws and found the game really depended on what cards popped during the first couple of turns.  And while it is possible to influence luck in the battle depending on what cards you add to your posse, sometimes they just get shot down hard (and this happened both ways)

Easy for one player to get an early lead and coast to victory.  While this is an LCG, and deckbuilding is a feature, I don't like how it plays out of the box and don't plan to play it again any time soon.

Plus it is loaded with confusing terminology. Nice theme but poorly executed IMO - not suitable for casual play.

Doomtown: Reloaded is a deck building game where the player must out maneuver their opponent(s) to gain board control to win the game. This game has a very steep learning curve. I don’t think that the learning curve is a negative thing, but this game is not for players new to tabletop games.

Pros:
1.	There is a well-defined theme throughout the game. The American Western theme is enjoyable and provides a setting in which players can role-play, if they so desire.
2.	The game comes with pre-built decks. Considering how complex this game is, it is very nice to be given some pre-built decks to help you get started.
3.	The different factions add variety to the game. Each faction has it’s own strengths and weaknesses. When you start building your own decks, your deck sort of gets its own personality, which can add to the role-playing aspect of the game mentioned previously.
4.	There are 4 different types of cards in the game.  I really like how each type of card is represented by the card’s suit (e.g. all Dude cards are Spades).

Cons:
1.	You never get to play the majority of your cards. As a player, you spend so much time building your own deck with all of these awesome cards, but you won’t get to play most of them. There are so many drawings and pulls in the game that you use for abilities and shootouts that you don’t get to use the majority of your cards.
2.	I do have to admit that there is some strategy with the board control mechanic, but the actual fighting (shootouts) is a bore. I feel like there is so much anticipation built up before a fight, but then the fight is over in a second and is anticlimactic.
3.	This is a continuation of the previous con, but fighting is mostly luck in my opinion. In a shootout, I could have 3 times as much fighting power than my opponent and still lose because he gets a lucky poker hand.
4.	Speaking of poker, this game claims to have aspects of poker integrated into it, but I highly disagree. The only similarities it has with poker is that it’s using suited cards and have similar hand ranks. But that’s not what makes poker fun! Poker is fun because even if I have a terrible hand, I can still win by raising and bluffing my way out of it. Doomtown doesn’t have this at all. Whatever you draw is what you get; there is not bluffing your way out.
5.	The tutorial that comes in the game is completely terrible.  The tutorial is long-winded and has a lot of unnecessary dialogue in it. The purpose of a tutorial is to teach players the meaning of different words and aspects of the game, but this tutorial uses all of these words and game vocabulary and never tells you what the definitions are. I had to quit the tutorial half way through so that I could read the rulebook to understand what the tutorial was talking about. That defeats the purpose of a tutorial!
6.	From the few times I’ve played, I feel like there is so little in-game money that I am unable to do anything on my turns. I may have the most amazing hand, but I can’t afford any of it. During one game I played, my opponent and I went multiple rounds passing because we couldn’t afford or didn’t have any deeds to play.
7.	The rulebook itself needs to have a glossary with all of the definitions of all the key words in the game. I’ve wasted so much time scouring the rulebook for the meaning of words that are on my cards (e.g. Huckster). It would be so much easier if there was an alphabetical glossary in the back of the rulebook.
8.	I find myself wanting to end the game as quickly as possible by going all-in in a shootout since so much of the fighting is based more on luck than strategy. I wish that fighting relied more on the actual cards and actions in your hand that way I get to use the deck that I so carefully assembled and use the combination of cards and actions to outwit and outmaneuver my opponent.

I wanted to like this game. I really wanted to. Problem is that my GF could not understand it's raison d'être. The goal is pretty abstract (Control vs Influence). I'm sure it works elegantly but the motions that need to happen to get the game underway just don't seem obvious enough to new players. I'm not skilled enough to make a case for the game. You're gonna put some cowboys into play, then you're going to build your side of the street, then we're going to walk these guys back and forth across the street and play poker.

Amazing well presented theme with with a strong focus on area control/influence and combat.  The games combat mechanics in particular are unique and refreshing using poker hands to determine outcomes.  The rules and deck building are a little harder to grasp, more obtuse than even Android Netrunner, however they are well worth the hassle of learning.  Great game, I highly recommend if your a fan of expandable card games and the weird wild west setting.

These type of games are so hard to tell from just one play. There is so much going on in this one. Not sure I'm a huge fan of the poker hands to determine random elements of the game, but I imagine that make deckbuilding challenging.

It's early in its release - but Doomtown was one of my trinity of CCGs (along with MtG and original Netrunner) and it will be fun to watch this game grow and develop.

But here's the problem: I'm already all-in with Netrunner.  Doomtown is a really good deckbuilder in the original sense of the world.  But I've only got the mental bandwidth to handle one deckbuilder right now, and that's going to be Netrunner every time.  Good luck, Law Dogs.

Awesome retool of a classic game. They've retained everything that made the original so great, while reworking the parts that were, frankly, problems with the original (the uniqueness rules, events, uncontrolled deck degeneration, and the cost/structure of the diamonds). 

I don't see how they could have done a better job with this. 

Kudos to AEG.

It took me a while to appreciate this game. The first few games I played I didn't think I liked it at all. Once I started to get the nuances of deck building (including building for poker hands) it opened up quite a bit. The only problem is that only one other person in my group is really willing to get into it. I'm hoping that this takes off a bit and more players buy into it.

Unfortunately, doesn't seem like that's happening yet.

RATING: 7
Cool game with excellent method of resolving conflict: Play poker!!! Deck must be balanced with good cards an being able to make good poker hands, so deck construction has a neat twist. 

Unfortunately, I don't have the time to devote myself to multiple card games at once, so Netrunner gets the nod here, but if I wasn't playing that I could see myself getting into Doomtown and possibly increasing my score if the deck construction/meta was healthy and fun. As it is, sorry Doomtown, but I'm taken.

I am not really one for the 2p cards games like Magic, Netrunner, etc... This is a stand alone game with a pretty cool idea. It was a hot game at GenCon 2014 and I wanted to try it. I picked it up and never got around to playing it. I was happy when someone offered to teach. It is a wild game with a ton of luck. I love push your luck games. This one might be a bit much. There are alternate rules to pick your starting gang but there is definitely room for to learn a lot about all of the cards and ability. It might require a lot of time to fully love it- I don't think I am that dedicated. I had a bit of fun in the first game just learning it but I don't see it getting played a lot.

Pretty good game, but not my favourite deck-builder, and it's a game that seems to encourage those who want to invest a lot of time into it (lots of key words and special abilities for each faction, etc) which means it gets played even less as each play I have to remind myself of all the rules.
Maybe I'll try to play it more in 2016.

Unintuitive, obtuse, and some of the clunkiest rules I've ever tried to memorize...  And I'm saying this as someone who plays Phil Eklund games.  
Yet somehow Doomtown is still incredibly engaging.   The art is amazing, the theme is perfect, and the showdown mechanics are a masterstroke.

When you play Doomtown, you aren't just playing a game. You're writing the screenplay for a series of fantastical spaghetti western vignettes. You can feel the dry air, and see the tumbleweeds blow by as bandits and deputies slowly circle each other... hands nervously hovering over their holsters until the tension breaks and someone gets called out.

I really liked the old CCG, and this revision cleans up rules, balance, and avoids random packs.  Like the old game, there is distinct randomness that is manageable but not avoidable.

I hope to see many more expansions to regain the richness and variety of the old CCG.  Perhaps including more factions -- I miss Sweetrock's cashflow absurdities!

Sadly, it is really only good 2 player and it is not the kind of 2 player game I end up playing.

Overall, this one barely but distinctly misses the mark for me in balancing luck, playtime, and strategic depth.

This game feels a lot like Netrunner, which I tried once and absolutely hated. However, it's got a better theme, and the actions at least make sense, although it has the same annoying trait of inventing new verbs out of nouns to describe (not very well) what you can do in an action. The poker hand mechanism is novel, and again, fits the theme very well. If offered, I wouldn't categorically turn down a game, but I would ask if there's anything else. I don't see myself buying it. It does have the benefit of being fast, and gives you the chance to abort a bad game by sending in everyone with guns blazing.

This game is a deckbuilder where all the cards are themed as people, places, and items in the old west.  They also have standard card nomenclature on them (A-K in clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds) and many things in the game are played out by building a standard poker hand.  Each person has an influence value and deeds as well as other things in the game have control values.  The goal of the game is to have more control points than your opponent(s) have influence points.

I really like this game.  The cards are varied with many different types that do all different things and just the base game came with a ton of different cards.  The deckbuilding rules are even pretty lenient so you have a lot of different options when putting it together.  I can't wait for expansions to increase my options even more.  And the mechanic of resolving conflicts with poker hands was great, especially since you could create an invalid poker hand with multiple of the same card in it but then there are cards in the game that trigger off of you "cheating".  This is well integrated, clever, and fun.

However, I do feel a lot of other pieces of the game were missing a little polish.  First, the victory condition is a bit convoluted and seems unnecessarily so.  Dudes have influence points and those influence points determine the control of deeds which have control points and you win by having more control points than your opponent has influence points.  Sure, this isn't rocket science but it isn't simple to understand and grasp either and it just seemed like it wasn't necessary when you could use a similar and more easy to understand system.

I also thought the shootouts and movement rules were a bit more convoluted than necessary.  And the shootouts themselves seemed to be the most important part of the game.  Many games seem to end due to one shootout because the loser of the shootout typically is set too far back to recover.  I get that this is supposed to be a quick game and I've also heard with experience players won't commit so much to shootouts if a loss would cripple them this badly but still, it's no fun to have one bad play mean the game for you.

There was also a little bit of terminology confusion, such as marking a character as used is referred to as "booting" them but the removed-from-the-game area was called "boot hill".  Choose any other term:  cemetery or graveyard, there's two without even trying.  Finally, the rulebook isn't the greatest and there should definitely be player aid cards included or at least have more pertinent information printed on the back of the rulebook (there is just the ranking of poker hands back there as is).  There is some pertinent information on the player boards but not some really useful stuff such as turn order and possible actions.

I know that was a lot of nitpicking but it was just that, nitpicking.  They do hurt the game but not enough to make it not enjoyable.  It's worthwhile for the unique poker/deckbuilding/area control game experience it offers with a ton of variety and well-done theme.

A completely unique and brilliant game! The level of strategy is very high and the complexity is staggering.  It is a chess game in a living western boomtown. The characters are alive and depicted through an engaging and evolving story line.  Their personalities develop as the game progresses with each new expansion release.

The game has a significant element of luck, mitigated and improved with strategic deck building and game play decisions, that ultimately never goes away and can have a drastic effect on the course of the game.

The issues here are card templating problems with the earlier releases that lead to significant confusion and misunderstandings.  
The rules themselves are not bulletproof and are constantly being revised and improved.  They take significant study, thought, and questioning to comprehend properly.
It is recommended to become familiar with how each card actually works as it can be surprising and quite unintuitive.  There are many resources available for rules explanations and the game has a dedicated rules team to help players with any questions they might have.

I found it initially difficult to wrap my mind around the reasoning behind some of the rulings, but they are logical at a fundamental level once a correct understanding of the rules is obtained.

The card art is just beautiful and the story team is amazing.  They have created a deep, rich, and flavourful living card game experience.

At its best, Doomtown is strategic gold. You try your best to outmanoeuvre your opponent, like an exquisite game of chess.

However, the game does feel flawed. The combat system can be exciting, but it can also be frustrating. A lot of luck is involved in what you 'pull' from the top of your deck. Many of the shootout cards are incredibly powerful too, which can leave little room for strategy - a well thought through plan can be undone by one of two cards in an opponent's hand.

The game is quite tricky to get your head around initially. The rules around movement come to mind.

The deck building restrictions are fun, and are one of the best aspects of the game. 

The quality of artwork on early cards was highly variable, but has certainly been improving.

All told, it's a good game.

Doomtown: Reloaded is deep and has a really interesting positioning aspect, which gives it a chess-like feel that's rare in card games. However, the thematic lingo takes a while to understand, and there's quite a learning curve on all the fiddly parts of the rules. Both the theme and the gameplay mechanics blend in the shootouts that are decided by poker hands made from the same cards you use to play the rest of the game, and the tension between stacking your deck with full houses and straight flushes versus powerful dudes and complementary abilities makes for the most interesting deck building I've seen.

This was not a game on my radar, but we received it as part of our swag from AEG's Big Game night at Gen Con.  First play through and my husband and I are really digging the game!  Look forward to future plays.  08/21/2014

RATING: 8.5
Update: Played about 15 games with the precons and still going strong. I've haven't even assembled the Fourth Ring deck yet. There's a lot of nuance to explore here. Upped the rating to 8.5.

Despite being a relaunch of an old title, Doomtown still feels innovative and fascinating. Judging the game as a single standalone box, it's at least excellent - my rating may yet improve. I'm still on the fence about buying into multiple copies and following the expansions - I'm not a huge fan of LCG's and don't generally do this. But obviously that would open up a lot more possibilities. 

The positional game is the heart of Doomtown, and it's fantastic - not only is it subtle and important, but it gives you the thematic impression of gunslingers sizing one another up around the town before finally resolving the conflict. Shootout resolutions are fast and fun too, once it finally comes down to it. The premade decks seem adequate for providing replay value, though of course they could be tweaked further with expansions and extra core sets.

My only reservation about Doomtown is the steep learning curve. The rules are somewhat involved and definitely novel, but it's the strategy that's tougher. It's one of the easiest games to play poorly that I've ever seen - doing obvious things (to a newbie) is likely to get you wiped out in short order. And even once you understand the basics, the game punishes mistakes harshly. Trying to play Doomtown casually with someone who might only play a handful of games would be pointless. Players need commitment to get anything out of it.

Still, a fascinating, quality game overall, even with just a single core set.

Loving the tactical, movement based gameplay.Really tense matches that feel a lot different from most card games. To me, how you use your cards matters more here than in any other game since the right option is not always clear.

For examlple. You can have Sun in Yer Eyes, a strong card neutering a powerful shooter. You get into a small shootout, do you use the card now, or save it for their best stud? You might not enter a shootout with their stud this round, so if you pocket it, you might not use it and are risking the current fight. Also, at the end of a day, you refill to 5 cards, so cards spent means more cards drawn. Interesting choices.

The more I play, the more I enjoy

I played a bit of Magic: The Gathering when I was younger, but was largely put off by the sales model, and the hyper-competitive nature of many players in my area. Doomtown: Reloaded has single-handedly reinvigorated my interest in what has become known as "living card games." Not only is the sales model much more reasonable, but I think the game is much more interesting.
In particular, I love the spatial nature that the game introduces. The need to move your dudes (characters) around to defend key points lends a sense of geography that is absent from many similar card games. Also, resolving shootouts by way of forming poker hands is just so thematic and FUN, and presents another layer of complexity when it comes to deck construction. Not only do you have to include dudes and items and deeds (locations) that work well together, but you have to make sure that you can draw high-ranking hands for the shootouts. Brilliant!
That said, the movement rules sound more complicated in theory than they are in practice, which (along with a few other rules) make this game difficult for new players to absorb at first. However, if you have a group (or even a single other friend) that can weather the initial storm, this game is immensely rewarding.

I wish I had this game when I was younger and had more time to play. Really deep, with fantastic theme, the best deck building on the market by none and just a lot of fun. Has a learning curve which is a little more steep than other card games, but it's well worth it.

A few extra 10th's for the premium edition which I have. Not really compatible with the CCG version, even if you used sleeves. Great for just playing the base decks that come with it but you know they'll milk the system with umpteen jillion expansion factions and decks.

A lovable oddball. Very bizarre both mechanically and thematically, but it all works together quite well and has been quite fun and interesting so far. The reason this isn't rated higher is that the learning curve is extremely steep, but it may go up even more after I'm a bit more familiar.

Feels odd. Like poker with a slight TCG element. Maybe expansions will help with this though, which will be nice, since they're fixed instead of random.

My first foray into an LCG game, and it showed me it's most likely not a category of game I enjoy. There's just too many rules and then having to build decks ahead of time is just a pain. I could rarely ever get anyone to agree to play this with me.

Box is damaged where it fell on top of another box, and punched through the base. Insert is slightly damaged too, around the top where the impact pushed the insert upwards. Still functions perfectly well, however. 

Will attempt to repair box, but i expect the damage will still be visible.

After several plays of doomtown reloaded, I can say the property 'dance' and the gambling 'shootouts' are interesting. However, I just don't have much 'fun' playing this. I am not sure why I don't enjoy it so much, I just don't.

RATING: 9.5
An expandable card game that is so fun and immersive, it may top my current favorite game-Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.

I had never heard of the ccg Deadlands: Doomtown from the late 1990s of which this game derives it's implementation.  I also never knew Deadlands was (still is?) a RPG, popular among the role-playing public.  It makes sense, though.  As I began reading about this title, I couldn't believe how alive the universe was being painted.

Every location, building, and character has a rich history, with it's own personality.

More than any other game I've ever played (save maybe LotR:LCG) I feel that I'm not pushing cards or tokens around, I'm moving people.  I'm putting them in danger.  I'm having them go to taverns and mines and post offices.  I am "in the moment" when I have the dudes in my outfit live through a number of days in Gomorra, California, the setting of this game.

This game is area control, chess, role-playing, and choose-your-own-adventure all rolled into one.  

AEG has presented a wonderful gift to gamers of all types.  Other what what I've already mentioned, the card quality it the best I've ever seen from a ccg, lcg, or now the newly released format of an ecg (expandable card game).  They have a linen finish!

They also have produced two player boards which are much more than card mats, they also represent the town of Gomorra itself.  It helps tremendously with the movement aspect of this game. Everything is first class.

I'm looking forward to continue immersing myself in this universe, and am confident AEG will create a thoughtful, long-term commitment to Doomtown:Reloaded.

I invested in this one quite a bit before I knew whether it'd take off for me. I enjoy playing but the lack of a dedicated play group for Doomtown hurts it when it comes to getting my money's worth.

Strong contender for the trade pile.

I've only played this once, but sadly none of the other three players in my gaming group who also tried it enjoyed it even a little.

It seems like an involved and interesting card game with a great theme, which I appreciate as a fan of the original Deadlands RPG, and old time CCGs like Magic: The Gathering.

That said, I've had little desire to get it played again, so the rating drops to a five.

The gameplay is very faithful to the original Doomtown, which had a great combat system and gameplay to it to begin with. The lack of Events does nothing to truly affect the game, and as has been shown with the upcoming Saddlebag packs, mechanics will slowly be brought back into the game.

A really neat game, with a neat theme and I love the way the cards are used not just for your actions but for the gunfights. However, the lack of ability to draw cards at will limits how many cards you'll ever actually see in your hand, and it's disappointing to do a gunfight and end up with a handful of cards you'd really like to have played for their ability, instead. Only being able to discard a single card before drawing up at the end of the round meant that in our first two games, I had a hand of useless abilities because I wasn't drawing Dudes or Deeds to use those abilities on. Then, we'd do a gunfight, and I'd end up wasting all my Dudes and Deeds.

Also, a single gunfight seems to be the climax of this game. Of the two games we played, each one had a single gunfight, and then that pretty much wrapped everything up because one player (never me) drew much better hands than the other, and did three or four wounds. It also feels impossible to get money to actually do things. You're basically going to play a single card from your hand in a turn, because that's all you can afford. And since you won't have money the first couple turns, and by the time you get to the third turn a gunfight happens and the game pretty much ends because of it, it is my experience that I get to play a single card from my hand, if any, for the entire game. You put the 5 Dudes in at the start of the game, and that's pretty much it. Brandon added a single Dude in the second game, I never added a Dude, and there was just nothing I could do about that. The game is supposed to take a half-hour, and I don't know if it even take that long. I was thinking about adding a third or fourth player, but worried how much that would extend the game, but if anything, I now think that would actually shorten the game.

Intriguing game that looks like a cardgame but feels more like an outmanoeuvring game. I love area control elements in my cardgames and this one is all about that. 

It's not easy to learn though. Rulebook could have benefited if more structure was applied. Lacks an index (although living rules has this now).  

Update: Played it with a good opponent and the game shined and revealed its greatness as it came alive as a strategic chess like dance with interwoven dramatic moments. 

* Uniqueness is its biggest selling point
* Very strong spatial element
* Poker battle resolution is brilliant way to handle fights
* Dramatic story arc reveals itself while playing

After the first two plays, I see a lot of promise in this game. I remember playing it in high school and it looks like Mark Wootton and team have tightened it up.  I'm excited to see the Blessed and Shamans. Everything is very clever and feels very thematic and tight.

Post AEG "wrap up" comment: I bought everything. This is a fabulous game and there's no reason not to keep a complete set. It's a real thinker, but there is no better Western themed game by my count. All of the 'Weird' on top is just icing on the cake.

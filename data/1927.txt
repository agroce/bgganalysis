Once the humor wears off, this game gets real boring real fast.  When the entire mechanism of the game revolves around screwing with other people's turns, it can make for very long, aggravating games.

I'm allergic to party games like this. The fact that so many people seem to like them is utterly puzzling. The kind of game that scares people away from this hobby (trying this and Ninja Burger a few times actually scared me back into Magic: the Gathering isolation and just made me less curious to try other games).

RATING: N/A
Having watched Tom Vassle review this game, I had a lot riding on Munchkin. Either I loved it and lost respect for Toms greatly balanced reviews, which in turn cast a shadow of doubt over all other reviews he makes in the future, or I disliked the game and agreed wholeheartedly that there's no real substance or longevity to the series.

Sadly, I believe the huge series to be simply a license to print money. The original Munchkin has the thicker cards and all subsequent expansions, which I also played, were of a thinner cheaper card, but yet still share the same sale price. So I conclude it's the biggest rip off I've encountered so far in the short time I have spent gaming. Thankfully the £50-odd quid spent on the game was not mine.

Each expansion doesn't introduce much, in the ways of new mechanics, its just one supercilious theme after the next. Light humour mockumentery themes being Munchkins strong point. The game was fun, for 5 min.

Not the most in-depth card game out there, but is worth checking out if you have spent any amount of time playing dungeon crawl type RPGs like AD&D... many of the cards reflect very real "munchkin" like behavior.

RATING: 5.5
A good idea for a game but it can go on for a bit.  Especially annoying if you get whacked when you are close to winning.  FROWN.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The cards and art are funny and punny. The actual gameplay is very drawn-out for the final stretch though. You essentially have to wait for all other players to exhaust their cards for someone to win and take the winning level. There have been games where someone teams up with someone at level 9 to help them defeat their last monster just so the game will finally end.

Maybe okay if you are drinking or want to play a long game [ie: 1-2 hours]. Each additional player you add adds roughly 40-60 minutes to the length of the game so beware.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Funny parodies and wordplays. The game isn't very entertaining, though.

I got a good item. I was forced to discard it on the next turn. I had a card to get it back from the discard pile. Someone took the card away. I gained a level, but then I lost it somehow. I tried to fight a monster, but another player cursed me and I died. Then we played for another hour.

RATING: 6.5
This is a fun little game.  It's entertaining, humorous, and a good parody of Dungeons & Dragons, that you don't have to be a D&D nerd to enjoy.   

Very simple to understand rules.  Cards are hilarious.  There's sort of a gang-up-on-the-leader mentality, but this is a game you play to have fun, rather than "to win" anyway. 

Only downside is that it hasn't had much longevity for me personally.  I've grown increasingly bored with it after a few plays.   Still, it was worth maybe a good half-dozen plays before I grew tired with it. Probably worth a "6" or so, but I don't think I could get into it so much as to buy the million or so expansions.

Funny jokes and references, but it's just a simple "take that"/"screw you" type of card game that can drag on way too long for what it is. The rules are so light that there is very little structure and little in the way of restrictions on how much you can try to screw someone in a turn.

Might be fun and appealing as a party game ... for RPG gamers ... with a lot of time available ... and nothing better to play. The game is very random (which for me, is not a good aspect). Also the 'take that' aspect of the game tends to extend the game length to waaay beyond it is  welcome.

RATING: 5
This is a simple take-that game that plays pretty smoothly.  I don't mind the randomness, but I really dislike the fact that some cards are just irrelevant in certain parts of the game.  This happens a lot when you are unable to defeat a monster and the "bad stuff" is just completely irrelevant.  

There are games that do things that Munchkin does, but better.

Only seem to play this game because my friends enjoy it. Its fun up until like the hour mark, Game is too long for the type of game that it is. and it becomes even longer once the game draws closer to an end.

Munchkin is about as random as this thoughtful gamer ever wants to get. Charging into battle with nothing more than an overplayed theme (which is what I happen to like most about the game), Munchkin has a barrier for entry that will have most people locking the dungeon door rather than kicking it in.

I bought this one in a fit of insanity. It's the epitome of childish insider yucks: I've played once with friends and it's worth a chuckle if you get the jokes, but it really doesn't know when to leave the table.

RATING: 4
Games of Munchkin usually either suffer from runaway leader...or gang up on the leader. The person to win is the one who can either jump to an insurmountable lead, or the last one to reach level 10 after everyone else has used their cards to stop other players. 

The novelity wears off quickly with this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This should be a short, fun game but frequently this turns into a long drawn out game. Also the end-game suffers horribly as everyone unloads on the first player trying to achieve Level 10 and for a then subsequent player to easily win. Needs more cards that allow you to play monsters to other fights.

This game served its purpose for when I was a more casual card/board gamer who was more into RPGs, collectible card games like MTG, and Table top war games. It is now a dated "old guard" sort of game that I will never play again. It is too simple and never ends. There are now so many expansions that it has collapsed in on itself and will be in the next Niel Degrass Tyson show about black holes. It is probably useful for trying to bridge people who play D&D to other board games or to make certain people hate board games in general. I guess if I were in a relationship with Munchkin, I'd say something like, "its not you. Its me. We have grown apart. You haven't changed, or done anything wrong, I've just grown as a person and no longer share the same interests or friends as you." etc.

It's a stupid, unbalanced, unfair, cheap game that might lead you into a serious argument with your best friends. The rules make no sense, there is (almost) no serious strategy possible. By now, I kind of dislike the author for making way too much money by producing more and more low-fidelity expansions. But then, again, I always look forward to a game of Munchkin with friends like a kid looking forward to meeting Santa (i.e. with lots of excitement and a tiny bit of fear).

My biggest problem with this game is that being the 1st person to reach level 8 or 9 has such a huge disadvantage. Every game I've played, everyone spends all their cards in their hand on the first player trying to reach level 10 and by the time the second person comes around, no one has cards left in their hand so the person is usually able to defeat the enemy with no problem. I also hate if someone at level 9 randomly draws a level 1 monster and easily wins the game due to randomness of cards.

The flow is a bit jarring and the cards are unclear. I catch myself directing each players turn like I'm narrating the game. No matter how often people play they still need to be nudged " no that doesn't go in you backpack" or it's not time to play that yet.

Fun though it can be slow and never-ending.  We played it with level 7 as the win-con.  (The rules suggest level 10, I think.)  I would play it occasionally (maybe).

ADDENDUM (12/30/17):  I've played this (and one or two of its variants) a few times since my initial review/reaction.  I don't disagree with it and I'm leaving my original rating (because from my eurogamer perspective it is spot on)...

BUT.  (There's a but.)  BUT... the game is great for kids!  My students enjoy playing it.  The game is horribly random at times and well overstays its welcome, BUT they like it!  So I can't (and won't) discount it and I've even invested in it (y'know, for kids!).

Worth playing with kids.  Because they may like it.

This was my gateway game! I fell in love right away, and it has been my favorite game ever since. 

The only reason that is not on my table more often is because we don't have the third player and it's kinda of hard to introduce to non-gamers. We introduced it to friends and family, some loved right away and some lost the interest in the middle of the game. Because of that I would say this is a Medium to Medium-Light weight, definitely not for everyone.

But it will always be my favorite! I guess most people feel that way about their gateway games. :)

One of the first games that I have played.  In this game, it is trying to mimick RPG computer games which players can take on different races and classes of the game.  Players are also required to beat monsters so that they can gain levels to win the game eventually.

Players can protect themselves by equiping themselves with amours, footwear, head gear and weapons so as to fend themselves with more powerful monsters.  Each monsters they beat will not only help themselves to gain levels but also treasures.  Players can asks peers to help them during battles, but peers may also help monsters to defeat you and weaken you during the game.

However players not only meet monsters in the game, they may be caught in some traps which will also weaken them in the course of play.  The first player to reach level 10 will be declared as the winner of the game.

Good points: An easy game to play with.  Players can have a lot of fun helping the monsters to defeat other players.

Bad points: If the initial cards are not useful / helpful in play, players will suffer for quite a bit in the game.  It is also tiring to read the effects of different cards whenever they are drawn into player's hands and players may mis-interpreted the cards effects.

Munchkin is tons of fun with a little more substance than Killer Bunnies. The win condition is to level up to level 10 first by defeating a monster. In many ways, Munchin has all the benefits of KB (humour, fun, etc.) without the lucky carrot factor. However, I do agree that Munchin does have a perchance to have a drawn out endgame that is sometimes painfully long.

As a side note, last night we played an epic 3.5 hour Munchin game where all 5 players fluctuated between levels 8-9 for over 1 hour. We attribute this to the Rat On A Stick card - if we're playing the card correctly, any monster that attacks that is level 8 or lower can be dismissed (i.e. no battle) if the owner of the ROAS discards. Last night, the winning player sunk to level 1 due to the W. Brothers monster (while everyone else kept their level 8-9) and then made a comeback by collecting charity cards and being the first player everyone turned to for help.

NEW! After reviewing the comments on BGG, I've decided to implement the following house rule for Munchkins: when the last card is drawn from the Search The Room deck, the game ends on that turn. I'll try this next time and see if it improves the game.

A dumbed-down, accessible and hilarious version of Dungeons & Dragons. I've played it a few times, with gamers and non-gamers, and have always had fun. I've tried numerous times since buying it to get others to play but have had difficulty in doing so. Perhaps it's only good for people who have the patience to learn all the rules before playing. Personally I don't think there's much complexity to it, but oh well.

This game has a bit of a social stigma around gamers. It is hated because of its popularity and simplicity. 

The game is rather enjoyable when you play it without a predisposition toward disliking it. The mechanics are simple, there is a bit of luck involved, its got a backstabbing setup that adds fun, but it has become a bit of a cash cow.

If you ignore the obvious "steve jackson wants to milk this golden child of a game" greedy production setup, then the game is fun. If you play the game for just the game its a lot of fun.

Have to dock it some points for being repetative though.

Munchkin is a game that you have to play with a select group of players. Not every person will get all of the jokes, nor will they be willing to dig through the rules in order to play the game. For a lot this game will feel pointless as it is completely luck based and there is very little strategy available beyond playing your fellow players.

With the right group of people this game can be a trip through nostalgia and will surely be enjoyable.

It might still be a gateway game for people, but in my opinion this game is too dated at this point. Not that I know of other games that do the *exact* same thing, but there's others with similar amounts of luck, meanness, and take-that elements that take less time to play.

This game is fun the first couple of plays, but once you read through all the cards, there's really not much point.  A major problem is that at any level, you can be attacked by any level monster.  It's easy to die, then instead of being eliminated, you reset -- similar problem in Talisman.  :P

Too long for what it is.
The game should be a filler. It's mostly waiting for people to waste everything in the first two or three players who are about to win, and then going for it.

If it was the twenty minutes silly cutthroat game as some people believe it is it'll be okay.

The humour in the game can get stale fast, although some people love it.

A favorite of a friend of mine. I like to play that as many people can help you as you want. (not just one person can help each turn) I like it best with that. However, this game sometimes overstays it's welcome. It's also caused some arguments among my friends which not many games have done. It's a bit hit and miss. I'll play but I'd generally prefer a different game.

RATING: 7
A parody card game based on RPG concept.  You start with a level 1 character and attempted to reach level 10.  Along the way you kick down doors and run into various monsters and if you are lucky, the other players will help you defeat them with a share of the loot.  Of course they can still screw you up with mod cards to make your monster encounter tougher.  Treasure card are either one shot bonus to combat or permanents.  Taught this to Aaron's cousins in about 15 min.  Need 3 or more to play.

Munchkin can be enjoyable for a bit, especially when combined with the various games of different themes, but ultimately, once you've seen all the jokes, the game is just a pile of bland and kingmaking.

Not a very satisfying gaming experience.

More on the game: The rules are very easy to teach, but the game length can last about 30 minutes to an hour over how long I'd like the game to play around (~1 hour, meaning the game usually takes 90-120 minutes).

The biggest problem Munchkin has apart from the terrible artwork and awful jokes is a game that feels as though it should only take 10 or 20 minutes can take hours to play. The game drags on for what seems an eternity and that much time spent with the 'humour' and 'artwork' is demoralising. I feel stupider after playing it and that's not a good sign.

While this game is highly based on luck, I know of few other games that can get cause the level of laughter and entertainment as Munchkin. I would suggest this game should be played with a minimum of 5 players (although you will need to own at least one expansion for this to work out well) as the lower the number of players, the more personal people seem to take curses etc. With larger numbers, more people get cursed and Wandering Monstered and thus your players see it more as part of the ethos of the game and not a personal attack on them.

Munchkin's artwork is hilarious, and I love a good backstabbing game full of twists and over-the-top silliness, so I was enthralled when I first came across this game. However, once the novelty of the cards wears off, gameplay isn't all that inspiring. 

Most of our games ended up very unbalanced. In all fairness, I have mostly played Munchkin with two players; so, since it's not supposed to be a 2-player game, I decided not to rate it. But I can't imagine that it would play much different with 3 or 4.

This game has many flaws but I still have a lot of fun playing it. The basic machanic is flawed and there is almost no strategy, but the humor breaks through that. Not for everyone, but for those who think a half-elf half-dwarf cleric wielding a Chainsaw of Doom and riding a turtle with a racing stripe and breathing fire is funny, then it's a game for you.

We have a chicken hat that we keep with the game.

Copy 1: Complete, w/ replacement d6 from later printing.  Non-color cards.  V. 1.04 of rules.

Copy 2 (trade): 19th printing, April 2010.  Complete, barely played.  Open-eyed Munchkin on box cover and color cards.  d6 is a replacement from an earlier copy of the game.  Box is solid but has some tape damage (pulled off paper) on the back and one side; some ink discoloration on the corners of one side.

Humor can only carry you along so far before it drones on too long.  The open-ended-ness of this game is what kills it.  It needed to be short and sweet.  Kick the humor in and keep the game play on the same level as the jokes.  But the game goes on longer than the jokes can hold up.  In the end it just tires you out and you'll find yourself wondering what a game of Munchkin: The Suicides would play like.

An epic, very social and interactive game. You are able to, and you MUST make friends, turn your back on them and backstab them (even if you're not a thief), since anything can change the course of the game. Being a douchebag may just lead to your victory.

RATING: 5
At some point, the game just becomes a ridiculous "Take That!" game, where whoever is in first when everyone else has used up all of their cards, wins. This makes the game feel like a random mess most of the time. Generally, the leader in the beginning game is the loser in the end game. With the right group, this game can be great, but otherwise avoid. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.3
Play it with friends, and beer, and a sense of humor. This is just not the sort of game that will win accolades based on its mechanics alone, but a sort of communal good time, so I'm not surprised it receives a lot of vitriol from the board gaming community. I find it fun to mix and match the various genres/sets and come up with some truly random and bizarre 'narrative', makes it all the more hilarious, but this is really the only mindset to approach Munchkin with if you want to enjoy it and not tear it apart.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
For me this game is a long series of inside jokes, but not that enjoyable to play.  I think that this is because too much of the game is out of your control and dependent upon the turn of a card.  Willing to try again.  (11/26/07 thrift find)

This is the type of game you play specifically to have fun and to screw over your friends, victory isn't important. Its easy to understand, quick to play, and its a great filler when you have an hour to kill in between classes. I think you need to have the right group to play with in order to get a good experience. It's the type of game that needs to be played with shouting, arguing, and alcohol. Far too many plays to keep a log.

RATING: 5
Fun and light at 30 minutes.  If a standard game took that long, it'd be higher rated for me.  However, even the base game takes more like an hour or more.  Still, the base game is better than most alternatives for some family scenarios where something like hearts is too heavy.  (that is more a complement to hearts than a dig at munchkin).

The base game does have some thought and decision making, that does in fact matter, even if diluted by chance, so there is some decent game here.

The epic version is horrible for me, although I only played it once and got completely crushed by a sequence of bad luck.  Sitting around while 5 other players do 'epic' turns, and you get a quick normal pointless turn, and have no leverage to be involved in anything but your own turn, for another 90 minutes is quite painful.

Basically, epic takes a decent light and almost quick game and totally breaks it.  Completely awful.

A fun experience of getting your friends killed, as you try to level up to 10, with some nice amusing cartoony art.

I feel the most fun is just seeing the cool art of a monster, and hearing the amusing things it does if it kills you.

However, the gameplay has too much 'take-that', in that players have so much ability to stop a player from winning, the game can drag on FOREVER, overstaying its welcome by a long shot.

I adore fast fun games, I like instant gratification, I like cynical humour gently prodding at sweeping statements of the snobbish. Munchkin still doesn't push my buttons even though on paper it should. Why not? Damned if I know, I never look that deeply into stuff, I get sidetracked too easily you see. I was saying to someone the other day about it, ironically they look a bit like Rod Stewart, do you remember when he was in The Faces?

i love the approach to D&D that Munchkin takes, no doubt about it. i played D&D growing up, so i can relate to the jokes and the over the top items. i was a little disappointed that the gameplay was so weak here, but it suits the game. not an ideal game to play everyday, but perfect to play when everyone is too loaded for anything else. a combination of Munchkin and Dungeoneer would make a better game of both of them.

Power gaming applied! :) Enjoyed RPG? Enjoyed collecting magical devices and earning more VP's than your mates? Ever wanted to backstab one of the members of your party? that's the game for you :) Some call it random, but it really works fine. Best thing is that everybody plays to the end. Even death of your charater does not mean you're going to loose. And usually the suspense gets higher, the closer is to the end.

Munchkin is a fun game, but since it is so depending on your card draws, you can be pretty bored and not a part of the game. If there could be a bank or vendor system for someone who keeps getting shafted to get a leg up when the rest of the players are in their "late game" phases, then it could help balance things out. Still, it's fun to stab your buddies and kill the monsters, and the zany cards, art, and descriptions are a lot of fun too.

I really enjoyed this game back in the day, and will still play it on occasion. Even if it isn't necessarily the best game, with the right group of people it can still be good fun! The biggest downside is that the rounds last way much longer than they should. Good game to play with non-gamers.

Play cards that feature "screw the player you want to spite" mechanics... usually the player in first, which only prolongs the game.  Repeat until someone randomly wins.  Basically a 2-4 hour party game for people who enjoy reading text cards with Role-Playing humor.

This game was both my gateway into other board/card games and the game that my group's game night originally formed around. Everyone still likes it, understanding that it's just a fun time waster more than anything. Personally, I see it as a stealth RPG, where the cards are just props for the characters to play with, since the whole point is to act like a moron. It's a fun game with the right understanding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game that gives me shameful flashbacks to the D&D games of my distant youth. Any game that allows you to "Bribe GM with food" to gain one level can't be all that bad. The "tongue-in-cheek" nature of the cards is very well done.

A good introductory game to new gamers. Can take forever to play, however, and long games are not very enjoyable. The player who is coming second generally ends up winning when everybody gangs up on the first player, making it pretty stale after a while. The 'take that' nature of the game is definitely not for everybody.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite (card) game.  Easy to transport/explain/play.  Fast, fun, vicious traitors, backstabbing, negotiation, a lot of thematic expansions.  Perfect warmup before big brained games.  ...If you like his typical sense of humor.

Juegazo de cartas, donde un va tan tranquilo hasta que le aparece un monstruo de nivel extra-alto. No hay que decir que tus "compañeros" no sólo te ayudan a que aparezca el monstruo, sino que luego se ofrecen a ayudarte por algun tesorito que te sobre: Cabrones. Pero en las mazmorras no hay ley y donde las da, luego las toman. Un juego de pura avaricia, donde lo de menos es matar al monstruo, hay que estar muy atento a los hachas que vuelan por la partida.

Modified game start with character drafting phase with basic equipment and ability to re-roll at a cost. Door deck deadlier with weight twoards curse, monster buffs, higher level monsters. Equalized restricted items and generics in door deck. Heavier on one time use items. Uses a concoction of nearly every Munchkin/Pathfinder/Oz and misc. Boosters/promos to construct the decks.

RATING: 5
I wanted to fall in love with this game, I really do - received it as a birthday present. However, the game is too much luck-dependent to even have any strategy to it. Gameplay is too swingy, too random and it reallyyyyyyyyyy drags. This is the only game that I would wish it to end faster even if I lose in the process. And this game really encourages the players to gang-up on the leader, which ended up dragging the game even longer.

encourages gang-ing up on players and screwing people over. Oh you're about to kill that lv. 2 monster and get the reward? I got a card here that'll make that monster more powerful, now it's lv.20!

This seems to have been replaced with Munchkin Zombies. The game starts off well enough, but then someone almost wins until everyone gangs up on them. This cycle repeats a few times before the game ends. So, a thirty minute game lasts around ninety minutes.

Surprises me the BGG rating is below a 6. Enjoyable, simple, and often times surprising. Limited rules will have you searching the internet for answers, and can get old when you're often targeted by opponents. The game seems lopsided when it comes to opportunities to assist monsters and gang up on leaders. Still, there's a reason why there are so many expansions to this game. A hit in our house.

When I was in college with the right group of people, this was kind of a fun game, *with* all the expansions (or as many as there were at the time; now there are dozens, it seems).  Now that I'm no longer in college, I no longer have the audience for the game... plus I realize that I never really liked it that much in the first place.

Now this game resides with a friend of mine who might embark for college one of these days, and at least likes the utter chaos.

I thought this was BGG snobbery with the disdain this game is spoken-of.

No, it sorta sucks.

There's some redeeming value to it, but I didn't like how freakin' clunky it was for the game it was trying to deliver.   There were just so many technicalities to it for a pretty simple, almost fluxx-like game it was trying to deliver.

most of the jokes were D&D humor, which definitely makes this a 'pass' in my collection.  I laughed, but I don't know who else would.  "Convenient addition error" was awesome.

Expansions included are Munchkin 2: Unnatural Axe, Munchkin 3: Clerical Errors, Munchkin 4: The Need for Steed, and Munchkin 5: De-Ranged.  Traded Munchkin and all expansions for Race for the Galaxy plus 2 expansions, 51st State, and In the Shadow of the Emperor. (2012)

Not very deep but the whole game revolves around LOTS of player interaction and can be a great light game for groups.  Warning: Lots and lots of ganging up to take down the big player and just utterly destroying them, so not for the faint of heart

I've taught this game to at least twenty people, and I've probably played this game 50-100 times before joining BGG. I've reached saturation point and I don't think i'd play again, at least for the foreseeable future.

There are few games, nay, few THINGS that annoy the living crap out of me more than Munchkin does.

A game that tries not to take itself seriously and only mostly succeeds. In the mean time, releases another expansion every time your dog passes gas. Merchandising for Munchkin is unwarranted and beyond out of hand.

The game just tries to replace a party game for the geekier crowd. I pity those who consider it excellent. I'd sooner play Taboo.

Munchkin is a really bad game that also happens to be really fun. With the right group of friends, the game can provide hours of laughter. With the wrong group, it is a tedious chore. The cards are funny is you grew up playing D&D. After you have read them all, though, the joke wears off. The game is random, vicious, and punitive. All that aside, I really love playing it with my high school buddies.

This isn't a game, it's torture. A pure money machine for Steve Jackson with no redeeming quality in my opinion. It's purely a "take that" game which rewards you for cheating. You actually can buy addition items to give you personal advantages in the game. Why learn how to get better at a game? You can just use a card from an "official" pay phone app. Or maybe instead you just bought a bookmark that gives you an added bonus. Or a Tee shirt that if you flash during the game gives you an advantage. If you padded Steve Jackson's wallet enough then you get a major boost over people that didn't drink the kool-aid.

If you own this "game" and actively push your friends to play, then they can't be blamed when they stab you... wait, let's be serious, if you own this "game" and actively push people to play it then you don't have any friends.

Why does this game have a bazillion re-themes but I can't buy Ogre Pocket off the shelf at my local shop? Sometimes the world makes me cry. This is one of those times.

It's fun and interesting, but random, and players always target the player who's about to win, to such a degree that being ahead is a disadvantage. Haven't found a way to fix this issue.

I played a lot of munchkin in college. I mean a lot. Possibly more than any other game except for euchre. Its easy to teach and the cards are humorous. Ultimately it's just a take that game where you equip cards and use cards against monsters and possibly your opponents. The main issue with this game is twofold. One, the game is very lucky. If you start out with a lot of good stuff, you will likely win, unless everyone successfully gangs up on you, which leads to the second main issue. Almost every game is won by the second person attempting to get to the last level needed to win. Usually everyone must gang up on the first person to attempt to get to lvl 10, and usually they don't have enough for the second guy. In my experience this happens 9/10 games. Different versions can still be fun, but you honestly can't take the game seriously at all, or you're gonna have a bad time.

Such garbage! 

The mass text on all the cards lead this to being WAY slower and WAY longer than it needed to be. 

Luck can completely ruin someone elses night because there's a fair chance that they'll get nothing at all to help them defeat monsters, and then they may continue to draw nothing useful while everyone else around them raises in level.

The 'humor' in the game isn't funny enough to warrant the super bad art style.

Hurting others just feels like your prolonging the game unless your tied for the lead, since it didn't seem like it was easy to catchup if your behind. This makes my favored 'create all the chaos' method of gameplay not too great in this game

It's a bad game. It's just very bad in my opinion.

If you like easily digestible humor and you don't want to think while you are playing, and if you're not a fan of well designed game concepts with fun game mechanics, and you enjoy drawing random cards from a pile that gives you zero control over what you will get, then this game is for you.

Oh, I forgot the worst part: It's a long game!

No matter how hard you try to like it, Munchkin is still one of the most annoying games I’ve ever played: it looks like a harmless filler but then it requires way too much time and effort before it comes to an end, which makes it the opposite of a filler. It isn’t funny either, as the jokes about bad roleplaying habits can be funny so many times only, even to a veteran roleplayer.

All in all the game boils down to a «gain a level, lose a level» turnover until all players but one (the winner-to-be) have had enough of it and do their best to cut it short.

The king of the take that card game genre.  You'll find more vocal haters for this game than practically any other.  Somebody out there loves it because it's one of the most popular, best selling card games in the hobby.  Personally, if played with friends it makes for a dumb way to waste an hour.  It's best with drinks and if it's not taken seriously at all.  The bash the leader endgame can be brutal...but I've rarely seen it cause a game last much longer than an hour.  When played with lots of interaction, wheeling and dealing this CAN be a fun game. It doesn't take much to ruin the experience though.

Great casual game for Tabletop RPG or Fantasy genre lovers (and on through the various expansion/variations - which is up to 8 or 9 in the core set alone).

Pretty much a very mildly cooperative but completely screw your neighbor style card game.  Loads of expansions and even some of the variations can be combined.

You are an adventurer that is looking for glory (reaching level 10 before anyone else) by defeating monsters and collecting loot, however part of the game play is messing with (or sometimes helping) the other players when they are attempting to defeat those monsters or collect that loot.

Pretty easy game to learn.  Other than the basic rules it's pretty much one of those "Just do what the card says" type games that shouldn't require a lot of explanation.

When judged as "just another game", Munchkin obviously falls flat. It takes far too long for such a random game, it is mainly bash-the-leader and the winner is the one who tries last to get to level 10 after all the good cards of his opponents have already been exhausted. Now, introduce a home rule where you have to drink a shot for every time you lose a level, invite a couple of people over who like fantasy and get the jokes, and it's going to be a blast.

First time I played this there were only two of us (we had just bought it and wanted to check it out before taking it to a friend's) and it was not much fun for two ppl. The second time (3 ppl) we ended up with a very weird deck where all the monsters were in the bottom and we managed to equip ourselves very well. Not much fun then either. But the other day 5 of us played and we had a laugh. The session took somewhere around 2 hours! (And I won!) :D

For a while this was the only game my kids would play with me and hence possibly the game I played the most often for a couple of years. Thankfully even they eventually got tired of it.
It is not completely without merit, the jokes are good, the art is good, the game just drags on (especially with the ease of whacking the leader).
House rule: only play through the deck once.Whoever is highest level at that point wins or draws or whatever, the game is over no matter what!

In general I really hated it and won't play again -- but it was really funny!

First, I am a big fan of fantasy/RPG/D&D-type games. I thought I would like this game. I considered buying it for a year or so before I finally broke down and bought it (the price was pretty steep).

Me, my wife, and another couple played this game. My wife and I ended up HATING it (even though I won), but my friends liked it. So it wasn't a total loss, I sold it to them, recooping most of the money I spent on it. I have absolutely no desire to play this game ever again.

The Good:
1. Um, the cards were mildly entertaining the FIRST time you read them.

The Bad:
1. WAY too expensive for what you get.
2. Even though this is a simple game, there are a whole slew of ambiguities in determining how different cards work together.
3. Artwork is ugly.
4. No replay value (not that there is much FIRST play value).
5. BORING.

It starts off well, the jokes are amusing...the first time. Then the games goes on...and on until the theme bleeds off. You're left with a game of simply adding one, subtracting one, etc. in ever taller stacks of cards and the person who can angle socially to play the last card wins. The basic strategies are obvious and the resolution after a long session of arithmetic could simply hinge on a flipped coin. Aspects of this game are fun but they're much better represented in more viable games. Your group might get a few laughs out of a few games if you play with no more than three players, but if you want to pass the time with cards in your hand, Citadels is a better choice.

Not a brilliant game, but really great at the niche it serves: sort of low-mental-effort quick party game for gamers.

It's in that category with Fluxx and Chez Geek. I'm a fan of the Steve Jackson style quirky sense of humor, so I don't mind this one too much.

All these games have essentially the same problem, they don't really force an ending in a specific amount of time, so games have really random play lengths, sometimes erring on too long for such lightweight filler-between-two-serious-games games.

After you get all the jokes, not much replayability either.

Once you realize that most likely everyone is going to reach level nine and then wait around 'til someone can level up because everyone used all of their "gotcha" cards, it just loses it's appeal. I'm also not a fan of introducing new gamers to something so simplistic because it can create a false impression of what a game should or can be.

This should play in 30 minutes or less.  It doesn't.  I'd rather stay home than play this game.  I'd love to rate this game as a '2' but the sad fact is that I will probably end up playing at least one more time.  Bah!  To be honest, I do have some revisionist history going on with Munchkin as I originally gave it a thumbs up but remembered it playing too long.  Over time, I've really soured on it.

It's munchkin. It's fairly quick to play, but the strategy is kind of meh. You never want to be the first to the last room, as everyone will dog pile you to keep you from winning, and then everyone's usually out of cards for the next person to make it to the end. Just kind of 'meh'. Not really bad, but it's not particularly fantastic either.

Lots of fun.  So far everyone who has played has enjoyed it a lot.  Initially rated the game a bit low because of the weak rule explanation, but now that we are more comfortable and have modified things to our understanding of the rules, I have upped my rating.  Much of the rating is for the fun factor.  Game play at times is actually kinda tedious.  I do like that in most games the scores are pretty close, mostly a result of the leader being ganged up on the others. many people give this game a low rating but they are wrong.  If the people playing aren't into the fun of it, then it will be a grind to play.  That is not the games fault, it is the players fault.  
We play with the 2 expansions each time and it works great.

Rating of 4 is based on a handful of plays.  Would play again if asked, but this really doesn't grab me -- so many other, better games out there.

Most recent play included several new players, two of whom dropped out before everyone had taken a turn.  Between rules confusion and perceived (or real?) rules complexity (What cards can I keep? Which ones can I play, and when?), it was too much for them.  The rest of us continued to play for a few rounds.  One player was stuck at level 1, with one card in play and none in his hand, while others had a lot of cards in play and were a few levels higher.  The game ended when a couple of us piled onto an attack, which was deflected to me.  I was defeated and played "Rocks Fall", which killed us all.  That was enough for all but two in the group,  and they realized we would all be happier playing something else.

Just... Not enough game here. Needs the players to bring SO much drunkenness to the table to make it fun probably, and even then, once players have run out of "take that" cards, someone just wins by beating a level 1 duck.

It's been years since I've played Munchkin. I think I played way too much of it when it was new. It's cute and simple to pick up, but I find that it became a bit of a grind after a while.

RATING: 2.5
One of the first non-standard games I've played, and at the time it was one of my favorites. Lots of laughs to be had with the puns and humor. Loose rules that lead to a lot of arguing and debating among friends.

Generally this game comes down to sheer luck. Second place almost always comes out on top... 

Now it is one of my least favorite games. All luck, no skill. Clunky rules. No difficult decisions. It's good for a few laughs, but it loses its appeal very quickly. I'll probably never play this game again.

Though I haven't played it for a while now, I really enjoy Munchkin (for what it is). It takes a bit longer than it should I think which can get draggy if there are more than 4 players in the game. I have all of the expansions and can't really comment them much because they've been a part of the game since I've had them.

Hard for me to rate.  I like the concept and don't take it seriously as there is an element of luck.  (I once drew three level 16+ monsters the first three turns).  The humor is good.  Overall, the game doesn't excite me, but it's good for a change of pace.

Le mécanisme de jeu de Munchkin se veut volontairement une traduction la plus fidele possible d'une exploration de donjon basique. C'est un dungeon crawler... sans le donjon. Le matériel de jeu est simple : une pile de cartes Donjon, une autre Trésor. Au début du jeu, chaque joueur tire 2 cartes Donjon et 2 Trésor, et créer son personnage niveau 1(en posant devant lui les éventuels cartes Race, Classe, Objet Magique et Pouvoirs en tout genre).

I would like to give this game a higher rating - because it IS fun - however the rules are atrocious. I still can't figure out some of the more basic concepts.... I'm just saying that it could have been done better WITHOUT the FAQ's, etc. (which still haven't given me some of my answers...!)

RATING: 6
In the beginning we had a ton of fun with this. This little card game can be epic! (when in the right mood with the right people.) The cards are funny and the rules are silly and that makes the perfect environment for mean and crazy play.

After a while not only the cards but also the backstabbing scenarios become well known and then the replay value is lost. Then it feels like the game drags on much too long, especially with high player counts.

It's necessary that everybody remembers to keep the good cards for the right moment, to prevent someone reaching level 10, otherwise it's pretty random who's winning. Basically the only skill in the game is to hold back on the good cards longer than anybody else, pretending not to have any, and then to find the right moment to reach for level 10, when the others have no good cards left.

If nobody draws any cards to interact or if they play them too early, the game can be extremely boring.

this was the game that really got me interested in games beyond abstracts, trivia and word games, I enjoy building up my character and the table talk that goes on with the stories of our adventures and I love how we always seem to manage some wild crazy unexpected twist at the end that feels too epic to fret over any tragic losses and backstabbing that occurred just before.  For a long time I would grouse about having to play this one when suggested by my family because it seems so pointless and random but then I always ended up having such a good time I finally had to admit it really is a great game for us

Munchkin started off on the wrong foot, when I introduced it to my family: they didn't enjoy it. The game was such that I won't bring it out with them again. When I trialled it with my friends, the game went over well. It's a good game, you just have to find the group that makes it one. It's too long, and it drags until everyone's out of cards. Sure, it's fun, but that fun happens up until level 5, then it just gets tedious.

It's boring to hate on Munchkin.  It's a bad game for all the reasons everyone knows.  It takes too long, there are no interesting decision, every game has the same arc, kingmaking is ubiquitous.

But in it's defense, I played 100s of games in college and I really loved it!  I think I still have the base game and a few expansions.  I haven't played it in 8 years, but it's no good to pretend that I never liked it.

For young guys who just want to laugh about silly fantasy jokes and fool around while messing up each others' game, it's a fine experience.  Not a "good boardgame" and I won't give it a good rating, but it certainly has its demographic.

Cosmic Encounter is one of my favourite games, Munchkin borrows mechanics from Cosmic and puts a twist on it. Another great game with take that, negotiation, betrayal, teamwork and backstabbing. I really like this game. My favourite Munchkin memory: In typical family gathering fashion, the boys went downstairs to play some Munchkin at 9:00pm in my grandparents tiny office void of windows to the outside world. Later that night after several games and not a clock in sight, we all guessed what time it must be and the closest would get to move up a level for free. My uncle came back downstairs from checking the clock and though I was closest with my guess of 3:30am, I was still way off as it was 6:45am and the sun was up! Needless to say we ended the game immediately and dispersed to our appointed sleeping chambers. I tried to crawl into bed with my wife without waking her up but was quickly greeted with, "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!” :) Good Times.

RATING: 7
This game is drastically better with only the base set or adding one or two expansions.  It gets very unwieldy the more you add to it, with constant pulling of less-than-useful cards, and difficulty making things work together properly.  If you pick up several expansions, I reccommend a sorting to choose which you use at different times, to avoid diluting the basic essence of the game.

If you like Ameritrash sillyness then you found the right place.  The cards are very tounge and cheek about D&D. Certainly a few laughs here and there. Everyone basically kills mosters with item bonuses for 95% of the game. Then once someone gets to level 9 its turns into "quick!..screw this person over however ever you can." haha. Once this happens you just hope to be the player in position to win after everyone has exhaused all their attack cards.  Still great fun none the less with the right people.

Munchkin is a very good card game, one of the most fun I have ever played, just on its strengths I bought Frag(another steve jackson game) and enjoyed it immensly.
If you have a rule question you can even pose it to the creators via the website.
It is a very funny game, and the expansions just add to the fun.

I despised this game immediately. A computer could play this game just as well as a person since it amounts to little more than drawing a card and doing what it says. Nine times out of ten the card you draw is useless and you waste your turn. The so-called humorous cards are boring. "Pantyhose of Great Strength" and "Boots of Buttkicking" may be someone's idea of humor but not mine. Avoid this turd of a game.

Thrift store find in excellent condition. Not my style for games. Spouse wanted to see what it was about to go with her D&D box set thrift find. Much rather play "Perfect Heist" (when I get the minis done and get it ordered!) which is loosely based on Munchkin but more realistic and interesting.

Ignore the other players until they are at level nine. Then hit them every turn to prevent them from winning. Hopefully, you and an elf can win together. Otherwise the winner is the first player who goes for victory after the players collectively have run out "stopping others from winning" cards.

Munchkin is a game that can be fun with the right group of people, with the wrong group though it could turn a pacifist into a homicidal maniac.  The sad thing, I find more people fall into the wrong group than the right group.

An excellent game altogether, as long as your players get into the spirit of it. Once people can see that they can be as merciless as possible, then the shouting and bickering and just plain fun begins :) If your group takes to it, add the expansions quickly or else it gets boring seeing the same cards.

Not as terrible as I'd been led to believe. Obviously the entire thing is random and it takes forever to play. If this played in a half-hour tops, I would be Ok with it. As is, it is torture. And I hate the theme, art and style of the game. And the humor is pure dork cheese. And I do lament that it seems front and center of every FLGS I've ever been to. It drives away exactly the sort of people I wish were more represented in the hobby. Ok, so maybe it is as horrible as I've been led to believe.

It's not a game I like playing all the time, or even often, but it has its moments, and it's made for good times in the past.  This one has hilarious cards, in expected Steve Jackson style, and it's doubly hilarious right before or after D&D tabletop sessions.  My biggest complaint about the gameplay is how much time it can take to finish--but that's pretty variable, because sometimes the game runs by very quickly.

RATING: 6
This game is light and mostly fun entertainment, and can be played 1) with non-gamers, 2) with children (or the elderly), and 3) after one has had a few drinks and does not wish to bend his mind too much.

For that reason, it is difficult to fully understand the unvarnished hatred for this game by many users at this site.   It isn't supposed to be some deep, mentally engaging brain burner.  It was designed to be:  a) kind of stupid, and b) a chop-down-the-leader type of game.  It succeeds at those, I think.

That being said, however, we do not play this any more.

A good card game that pokes fun of the power-gamers that frequent D&D.  It is a good beer and pretzels game, but has very little strategy and any & all tactics go right out the window.  Cute artwork, but gameplay is lacking in some areas.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Quirky and fun, but with silly mechanics and almost no structure. The point of Munchkin isn't to be a good "game" but to be whacky and outrageous, and in that regard it usually succeeds. A great game, worthy of praise, but one that is definitely overrated (But only because it's such a huge sensation!).

I love Munchkin mainly because of the comic drawings on the cards. I like playing the game but the thing that sucks is that some players who fall behind in the game do fall behind.

Warning: this rating is based on only one play.  My husband and I started a 7-player game and found this really tedious.  It's unnecessarily long, and we weren't sorry when we had to end our game before finishing.  The game is largely based on special cards with names and descriptions that are witty to role players.  At first I didn't understand at all and my sister had to tell me what to do on every turn.  After a few rounds, we had the basic idea, but just didn't find the game fun.  However, everyone else (who already knew how to play) loved it.  Guess it just wasn't our cup of tea.

This is basically Progress Quest: The Card Game. 

Which is to say, it's a parody of people who play D & D (and its ilk) in an almost hypnotically uninteresting way by simulating a D & D game with all except the almost hypnotically uninteresting elements removed. I make it a point of pride to never intentionally throw a game just because I'm bored (the theory being that presumably someone at the table is having fun), but I ended up winning because someone threw the game to me. This is probably not a hopeful sign, nor is the fact that I was saying things like "KILL IT WITH FIRE" after the game passed the 60 minute mark. Cut the average playtime at least in half, you may have a decent-but-still-not-appealing-to-me lil' filler. As is, please note that Progress Quest can be downloaded on all major OSes. For free. Munchkin costs 25 bones.

Avoids being a one just because it contains recognizable game-like elements.

This game seems friendly until the end, when all bets are off. You need help to progress levels, but no one will assist in that last level, so you have to be able to beat the final monster(s), plus the extras opponents throw at you, by yourself. Might be fun with 4 or less people, I have only played it with larger groups.

Great game if you don't mind sticking it to other players. Super light but fun game that is more of a diplomacy/negotiation game than anything.

Munchkin is okay, just okay.  It's a version of "take that" which has some humor and spunk to it, but winning is rarely a question of skill.  It's often the case that whoever wins will just get lucky and and draw the least ire from the other players. 

If you can get invested into the concept of dungeon crawling in a super-lite style, go for it.

The cards are fun, but the game is pretty bad. You draw a card, if it's a curse or a powerful monster, your turn is wasted. I had absolutely no choice to make in the entire game. The winner will likely be the one who picks weak monsters at first or draws a card which isn't a monster or a curse, which lets him draw another card to add to his hand.

An 8 when playing with my son.  He thinks this game is hilarious.  Some of the more naughty jokes pass him by, but the others he gets.
Anyway, this is easy, fast, and funny.  Some of the humor is clever, but mostly geeky self-deprecating stuff which is good. 

Should be "Usable only by geeks", this dragged with non- gamers, one of which plays DnD every now and then.  Also probably best with three or four, more than that is cruel, although you get to see most of the cards that way.

We played this a ton in Jan/Feb of 2015.  It quickly wore out it's welcome and was replaced by games like TTR, Splendor, Biblios, Survive:Atlantis, and even good old Catan.  

Downgrading from 8 to a lower score after a year of playing other fantastic games.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game, but there are many others that I enjoy so much more.  I think I just don't like card games much and really dig Euros.

RATING: 5
I've played once...and I enjoyed myself. I'd be willing to play again under the right circumstances, but I can't imagine why people feel the need to buy all the various iterations if this "game".  

There isn't a hell of a lot to do, and a lot of it is just luck of the draw. There are some funny cards and combos, and I had some good laughs...but I think familiarity with the deck would silence that pretty soon, with repeated playings.

If the right group were together and folks wanted to play this, I would...but otherwise I would rather pass.

This game seemed like it was right up my alley. Having played D&D for a long time in my youth with a gaming group of guys who seemed more interested in kicking monster butt and overpower their characters with magic items than actual role-play, I thought a game spoofing this behaviour could be an entertaining trip down memory lane. Will have to give it a second try to rate...

This is one of my all time favorite games. Those who complain about it are just sore losers and were on the losing end of the gang-up. The rules even encourage this and make no effort to hide that fact. There are cards in the game that force you to help others and can give you immunity from attacks so there shouldn&#039;t be any complaints. Definitely a game for those that want to play RPGs but don&#039;t have the time or patience to learn all of the rules.

"I'm a level 10 Vice President."  If you're into dungeon crawlers, I can really understand how this is a great, light alternative with cool art and a whimsical theme.  Steve Jackson really hit it out of the park for that particular audience.

Unfortunately I'm not part of that audience, and this game holds little-to-no appeal for those not already taken with it's theme.

RATING: 7
This is our go-to party game and probably the most played game in our collection. It's funny, it's fun, it's really easy to teach to people and appeals to a wide range of our friends from complete non-gamers to hardcore gamers. We have purchased expansions to twist the game more to our liking (more modifier cards are a must to make it more munchkiny). Games can take anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes depending how much time the group spends mucking around sledging each other.

This is the first "new" board game we bought. Thanks TableTop.

I dislike that your belt has endless capacity - I like the rule from Munchkin Quest that lets you have as many one-shot items on your belt as you like but only 2 equip-able items. It's possible to speed up or slow down the game by increasing or decreasing the amount of cards you get at the start of the game.

I can understand that some people don't like this game - There is a lot of luck, players can just decide to gang up on one particular person and there isn't much they can do about it, it's possible to be a kingmaker and it's possible to have no interest in winning at all and just ruin other peoples battles. There's also a problem with people just saving their cards to deal with the first player who looks like they are going to win instead of interacting with each other the whole way through.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My opinon fluctuates with this game. The base set is amusing for awhile, however, I really don't think it would hold up to regular play without sinking money into the various expansions. That said, it's easy for non-gamers to play, and good fun with beers. I also purchased the Munchkin brand xp wheels since I was hoping to not deal with counters. I'd rather play Talisman and it's various expansions, despite it's fiddly, random nature and bits.

Humorous, especially for DnD/MMO players.  Games can be exceedingly and excruciatingly long though to the point you just want to get it over with.  At its best it is a lot of fun.  At its worst, frustratingly boring.  With each game you never know what you're going to get.

RATING: 4
Not really my cup of tea. I don't mind randomness when it's accompanied by either of the following: a solid theme and a relatively short play time. An example would be Betrayal on House on the Hill for the former and Zombie Dice for the latter. But Munchkin has neither. Its humour is good, though, I'll grant it that, but what good does it do it when you've read the cards?

This is one of the first take-that card games we got into (aside from obviously growing up with games like Uno), and it's an enjoyable game every now and then.  However, as we've played more and more games, this continually fails to impress and makes it to the table rarely now.  Yeah, we have fun with it, but there's so many other games that are more enjoyable...

Good game to play in a group as it is fairly easy to learn. Strategy wise I have learned (across the different versions) that the first player to make it to level 9 rarely wins. When they have to fight that last monster to win the game the others players will pull out everything to prevent it. Last game I played (Munchkin Fu) I was level 9, had 30 strength (and plently of pump ups) vs a level 1 monster and still managed to lose due to the others throwing everything they had at me. The next player to reach Level 9 won easily as all the nasty cards had been burned. So bit of advice - be strategic about when you hit Level 9.

Awesomely tongue-in-cheek, and a great parody, but a little too random; I had almost no chance of winning the game, because I was never able to draw monsters to fight -- not monsters I could defeat, but actually monsters *to fight*.  In a four-player game, I was still only level 3 when the other three guys were levels 7-9.

Hát ez nem nyert... első olyan játék, amit -egyelőre- megbántam, hogy elkészítettem házilag. Bár nagyon sokat dolgoztam vele, a társaságnak nem jött be. Nekem egy fokkal jobban tetszett, mint nekik - jobban kedvelem az ilyen fárasztó poénokat és ha fordítás közben nem tetszett volna, úgyis abbahagyom - de sajnos van egy olyan érzésem, hogy ritkán fog előkerülni...

Még egy megjegyzés: Leginkább a gond azzal van, hogy minden kártyán más utasítás van, azt végig kell olvasni, "elemezni", eldönteni mit mikor játszok ki, stb. Ez viszont lelassítja a játékot. Márpedig egy játék akkor lesz igazán vicces, ha pörgős!

Update: négy fővel is kipróbáltuk. Okés, játszható és nem rossz játék, de nem az én világom. Szeretem az átlátható, világos szabályokat és szerintem ha egy játék ennyire engedi, hogy tisztázatlan dolgok történjenek, és engedi vitázni a társaságot, akkor elrontja a játék lényegét. Mi nagyon barátságosan játszottunk, nem vitáztunk meg ilyesmi, de még itt is előjöttek nagyon vitás dolgok. És ezekkel csak az idő fogyott, meg a kedv... Szóval többet inkább NEM.

5-6 éve készítettem házilag a játékot. Én fordítottam le a lapokat magyar nyelvűre (ennek oka, hogy az eredeti angol nyelvű kártyák és a magyar kiadás között rengeteg félrefordítást találtam), nyomtattam, vágtam, ragasztottam, saját dobozzal rendelkezik. Ezért sem adtam el, eddig. De értelmetlen, hogy a szekrény leghátsó részén porosodjon.

Like most Steve Jackson games, Munchkin isn't a game.  It's a medium for Jackson's twisted humor.  By all means, read the cards and laugh ... but the game play is just painfully awful.

Specifically: I dislike that everyone's incentive at the table (if you're not the leader) is to prolong the game. I could have more fun with the munchkin system if it worked toward an ending and wrapped up in that 30 minute area ... but I've sat through too many painful episodes that went on for hours ...

Munchkin, munchkin, munchkin....it's a well put together, hilarious, and witty card game. In my experiences though, it always leads to some kind of conflict between some or all of the players. I like competitive games, but man I have seen some heated moments in this one. A little too much for me.

RATING: 5.25
Own the Deluxe version, comes with the game board, rather than just the cards and dice.

Gets played on rare occasions.  Better with higher player counts as too few leads to less interaction, and one person can walk to victory.

I have found that, more often than not, if one person runs ahead too early, then everyone uses their stronger cards to prevent them, and it's usually the 2nd/3rd players that get to level 10.

This would have gotten a higher rating when I first got this game. Now it just really isn't that exciting. It is hilarious to play as long as you don't play it too often. Once you know all the cards, you start to get sick of the jokes, or they just lose the novelty.After that the game play doesn't really seem that worth it.  
Can be fun with the right people playing. A bit too long for the type of game it is as well.

Munchkina poznałam na imprezie u znajomych, początkowo gra była bardzo chaotyczna, wiele rzeczy wychodzi dopiero w praniu przy wykładaniu kart, kiedy wydaje się, że koniec rozgrywki jest już blisko, nagle wszyscy rzucają faworytowi kłody pod nogi i jazda zaczyna się od nowa. Rozgrywka może trwać nawet kilka godzin (never ending story), w zależności od liczby osób, ułożenia kart i determinacji graczy. To pewnie dlatego Munchkina albo się kocha albo nienawidzi. Tutaj nici z Twoich strategii i planów, gra totalnie zaskakuje, śmieszne obrazki i komiczne tytuły kart z ich opisami powodują rozbawienie, brawa dla kreatywności tłumacza.

Post-Wheaton effect buy.
Eh...a relic of times gone past. I mean, it was...OK. I kinda appreciate the humour as it's self depreciating and kinda appropriate for the game. 

As a randomised 'take that' encounter engine, it suceeds insomuch that you can suceed, buff youself, get in the way of other players and have a good time with your friends being jerks to each other.  In the same vein, there is equal possibility of having a fast game where you zoom to victory without being stopped or squander at level 1 because the draws prevent you from fighting monsters or getting enough stuff to beat them. 

Maybe I'm just a hipster. It was fine. I can play this, and I understand why people can enjoy this. Though (like any patron of the fast flowing 'net) I'd rather play the stuff that is new.

RATING: 3
Good gateway game, albeit a bit silly. Almost every game I have played suffers from the same problem, where one player gets ahead and then everyone attacks him to knock him back to level 0. Then one lucky person takes advantage of everyone else having used their weapons/etc and ends up winning. But it can still be a decent social game, especially for lighter gamers.

I consider this to be one of the biggest boardgaming failures. It has a terrible endgame that lasts forever in which players constantly stop one another from winning without doing anything to progress their own position.

I wanted to like this, I really did.  It has a goofy fantasy theme and seemed a perfect stage for fun game-related table chatter.  Unfortunately, it's only fun and funny for the first 5-10 minutes (and maybe only the first couple of game plays) and then the game goes on for WAY WAY too long.  My pre-teen nephews love it, though -- maybe the humor lasts longer if you're younger.

I love the humor in this game.  The only downside is with the luck of the draw.  Some game plays the same person gets cursed almost every turn.  Other game plays a player will get hardly any bonuses.  To me that all part of the game play and replay-ability.  Most importantly my kids love playing this game with me.

RATING: 6
If you like the theme and/or have RPG experience it is likely you'll have fun and laugh. However the rules can lead to arguements/cheating (encouraged by design). Most games end simialrly with everyone at level 9 until there's no way to keep a player from winning.

The original, and now in full colour. 

What I might do is see if I can play a few more games of this as a "speed" game and see if this revises my opinion of it. I used to love this but it has a tendency to drag on these days.

Tricky game to rate. Ive come to the conclusion that munckin really is about the players you play it with. Ive had games that I just wanted to end as soon as possible and ive had games that where extremely fun where the time just flew by. In the end, I have to be in that munchkin mood to want to play it. And if that colides with a nice gamegroup the game can really be a blast. Also im a Roleplayer at heart so i love the comedy and the cards, altough its not nearly as fun to draw the "sneaky bastard sword" the 3rd time as it was the first.

Munchkin and all of its sequels violate my third general thought on games in my profile very strongly. And while we're at it, probably also the first.
So I should hate it. But I still own were much of the Munchkin family and think it is a good game when in the right mood, because it can be pretty funny. I suppose one should be no stranger to role playing games to appreciate the humor, though.

This game has an oddly alluring appeal to those who traditionally don't associate with fantasy or role-playing.  I'm not sure if it's the art, the irreverent attitude, the backstabbing and sex changes, or something else entirely - but this is so popular around these parts it gets requested directly.

It's not a bad game, and does the job of entertaining a group of players for an hour or so. However, it's extremely luck-dependent and the backstabby aspect means that it's more important to bide your time than to try to win, as the first player to get to level 9 will be crushed by the other players.

All the reasons everyone rags on Munchkin are all the reasons my family loves it:
-It's random--my 10 year old step son, while happy to play heavy games, has a hard time developing winning long-term strategies. He likes this game because "I can win that one"
-It's silly/not serious--Perfect! Right up our alley. We prefer to describe it as comical and light
-It can lead to "take that" gameplay--It's would argue it's encouraged. We enjoy that mechanic and aren't sore losers...so...TAKE THAT!

I don't know, we enjoy it. Enough said

I'm OK with this and the kids (boys, 11 and 9) like it - probably because it means they can say 'butt-kicking' in public.

Definitely annoying they didn't include level counter components - how hard would that have been?!

Easy game to pick up. Entirely random - I don't think there's any more skill involved than you would find in Go Fish. Fairly amusing.  I play this with my brother-in-law and his wife: it's the only game he seems to want to play other than actual D&D.

Being a former hardcore Dungeons & Dragons player I found this game hilarious the first couple of times I played (the novelty wears off fast though).

RATING: 8
Enjoyable light hearted fantasy game, but often maligned because most games are very samey when it comes to mechanics and playstyles, and I have to concur. There are a lot of cards to screw with the leader or various other players, often resulting in the game winner being placed in a kingmaker situation or everyone else simply running out of attack cards at the wrong time. Still, it is quite enjoyable just in smaller spurts. The expansions add a lot of the same, but breathe new life with more funny but not a lot of mechanics. A bit light and casual, but I wouldn't pass up a play.

When I first played Munchkin, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The learning curve was shallow and design was silly and accessible.

As I've gone on to play more games, I've found that Munchkin has ended up in the dust behind games that do what it does better. Also, sorry to say, the jokes do sort of lose their charm after a couple of plays - we get it, nerd stuff is funny.

I don't think anyone is going to come away from Munchkin having had a really terrible time, but there's better games out there.

No thanks.  I don't want to just flip over cards and see what happens to me, especially when the game can be extended forever by backstabbing and other means.

Sure, the humor is cute the first time you read things, but that wears off quickly.

I'd almost rather play Go Fish.

Good fun with the right group of people. A bit long for a filler game but great for a laugh and tons of screwage. Just don't take it seriously and you'll have a good time. Suffers from drawn-out endgames thanks to major "screw the leader" play but it's still good for a laugh.

Given the choice I'll always play Cutthroat Caverns instead.

I don't know, I really like this game. I'm still "green" to it, so I probably won't be turning down play any time soon. Furthermore, I've owned it for over a year and *just* got people to play it with me at work, so I've got some plays in me before I get sick of it, I'm sure.

The dungeon-crawling card game that started them all, Munchkin is an adorable card game where you try to defeat monsters and go up in levels until you kill one final monster and reach level ten. Illustrated by the visual genius of John Kovalic, the artist behind the newspaper comic strip Dork Tower, the cards are wonderful to look at and the gameplay is just top notch. I would love to get the many expansions for this game but even the base game is fun. Good game to play before a campaign session of D&D or any other tabletop RPG you play.

RATING: 8
For a game that hasn't been redesigned for its rerelease other than the addition of a board, I'm a little frustrated.  They should just price it $30 instead of $20 and include the expansions Munchkin 2 Unnatural Axe and  Munchkin 3 Clerical Errors.  As it stands, I feel cheated every time I take the lid off the base game box to see the tiny stack of cards dwarfed by the gigantic box they're inside.  But instead they nickel and dime us.  Argh.  Anyway, the game itself is a light and fun dungeon crawler parody that I love playing as a backup with groups that can't handle a more complex game.  The board, although small and incredibly simple improves the experience tenfold while still sticking to the original formula everyone loves.  Munchkin quest is also fun, but it's no longer as simple as convenient.  And let's face it, that's the only reason I reach for this over more complex games.  Groups that want something simple and fun.  Not everyone is on board for a 5 hour Arkham Horror or Twilight Struggle session and this is sure to keep that crowd happy.  This and Lords of Waterdeep are my go-to simple games.  And they are both very fun and very easy to teach.  Get the expansions for replayability and help Steve Jackson buy another house.

RATING: 7.8
2 to 6 players. Hilarious cards and funny game play. It's a game that doesn't take itself seriously and I've found it to be pretty fun. Because of the constant involvement of everyone trying to screw everyone else games can end up taking a long time.

RATING: 7
I do love the illustrations and some cards are hilarious. It's hit or miss for sure, but the style and art is maybe the best thing munchkin has to offer.

While the game is really simple, the rules are often not very clear and a match can take very long because of high inbalance and players targeting the highest-leveled player.

Make house rules for when the game ends and it's much better! Some expandions (like the dungeons or Munchkinomicon) can make it even quicker.

A game with plenty of naysayers, but with the right crowd, this game is a blast.  It captures all the fun of fighting monsters and looting treasures, only it does it in a simple, fast card game that just about anyone can play.

I loathe the artwork though, and it's more about diplomacy and backstabbing than strategy.

As much fun as a D&D session, but much faster.  Poorly-organized rules and a lot of errata.  Don't buy new, it's not worth it.
I bought it on sale, sold it for a dollar's profit.  Good for me.  
Did you know Munchkin-related goods accounted for 30% of SJG sales in 2003?

Card art is cute and funny. The sarcastic play off Dungeons and Dragons theme works for this game. Unfortunately game play drags until players reach near the end game condition which plays out predictably every single annoying time. You can get really hosed by card draw in this game even with some negotiating for assistance from other players.

This is the lowest example of the take-that mechanism. I'm glad I've moved on from this game.

I personally really like this game, but it's hit or miss for my friends.  It's simple enough to teach the basics, but there are always so many detail questions that come up, and I had struggled to find the answer when needed. I feel that the rulebook could have been a bit better.  Basic concept - each player is a simple human to begin, and as you "adventure" and search different rooms of the "dungeon" (it's a card game, so this is all in concept), you fight monsters, and gain treasures, and level up your "character" along the way.  The final goal is to reach level 10 by defeating a monster.  A frustration I have is the amount that luck comes in to play as far as being able to affect other players combat to "win" the game.  But, all in all, it's a fun enough game in my opinion.

It helps to enjoy this if you are or ever were into RPG's, otherwise the humor may be lost.  I find this a fun, light game.  WHatever strategy you have can be thwarted by the other players if they have the right cards.  After a few plays through the jokes can get old and the game looses some appeal, but that's what the expansions are for!

What can I say that hasn't already been said about Munchkin?  To be honest, I'm surprised at how low of a rating this game has, I would imagine that a lot of this has to do with how long the game has been out.  Well, the magic is still alive for me!  This is one of my favorite games in my collection, and even though everyone I know has played this game to the point of having the cards completely memorized, it's still one that we all love to play.

I admit that I own only the base game itself and have not bought any of the expansions, mainly because my friends own them.

Wowie, Munchkin has certainly spread itself out.  I still love Munchkin even though I have moved on.  All of the expansions or different core sets are (pretty much) exactly the same or offer a very similar experience.  I will say, I don't prefer Munchkin sliding into my other gaming experiences like Munchkin Castle Panic or Munchkin Smash Up.  On its own, always a good time.

Mixed feelings about this: players need to be-long date D&Ders. Anyway, It is fun only if pulled from the shelf once every 6 months. Some alchool makes the game definitely more interesting. Generally speaking, I have the feeling it usually drags too long.
Nevertheless, when everyone is in the right mood, can be a blast. Poor quality. Got as a birthday gift.

Was expecting it to be pretty bad based on what I had heard, but I'm not sure what all the trolling is about as it wasn't bad.

RATING: 5.5
While I appreciate the tongue-in-cheek theme aimed at DnD, I think the game itself is somewhat lacking in depth. The combat is too simple and the course of the game is dictated almost solely by luck. The game breaks my #1 rule of eliminating players early (only a few cards do this, but if you're unlucky, you could be sitting for an hour waiting for the game to finish).

Currently I just own the original version of Munchkin without any upgrades.  I have read a few reviews of this that say it isn't funny if you have never played a fantasy RPG, especially D&D.  This isn't true, my partner, who has never touched an RPG in her life chuckled plenty but there are jokes in here that will only be got by old D&D afficianados.  The magic missile for instance, the staple of the 1st level wizard in D&D, is represented here but drawn as one of the least aerodynamic ICBMs ever.

The game itself is quite playable and the rules can be picked up  easily enough by playing the first game "open".  That way the options of play become apparent to all.  There are one or two small ambiguities in the rules but these are, on the whole, addressed by the FAQ section at the Steve Jackson Game's Website.

Play it and enjoy.

Very entertaining game, with some fun and innovative mechanics. Have played this quite a few times in my group, and although it isn't as in-dept as say Civilizations, it does very well for a short game. We often use this when we've little time left, but still want to try something that doesn't take ages (of civilization) to set up. 

Taken for what it is, a short and fun game, meant to be played on expense of whomever you can gang up on, it's a very nice game.

RATING: 5
This was one of my 'gateway' games into the hobby. Played it in college with my roommates a few times and went out to buy a heap of expansions. Played a few more times with said expansions and then the game just faded from our favor.

Likes:
I like the sheer variety of cards the game comes with, the different classes/races/etc that promote different playstyles and such. The humor is a bit hit-or-miss, but I got a chuckle out of a few card names. 

Dislikes:
Munchkin has a huge pile-on-the-leader problem. Typically whoever is in second place as some approaches level 10 will get the victory as everyone dumps their bad cards on the leader to try to kill them. This was dog-pile was fun the first few times, but soured quickly.

Additionally, Munchkin has this concept of 'munchkinness' which basically boils down to be as big of a asshole as possible. This is a take-that style game, so that would normally be fine. But the game goes out of it's way to promote douchebaggery, such as wearing official merchandise gives you stat boosts and cheating is okay if you aren't caught. This concept just grated on me as we played more games and one particular roommate began taking 'munchkiness' a bit too far.

The game will always have some nostalgia value as one of my first forays into modern boardgames, but its time on my table is over.

Finally, the game suffers some "pile on the leader" as well as from a not very interesting gameplay.

I have only played Munchkin twice, and each time I loved playing.  Why, then, have I only played twice?  Well, this game is friendship-bane.  There are so many things you can do in this game to just relentlessly screw over the other people you are playing with.  It gets to a point where you get so into messing with other players that you forget to try to win the game.  I stretched one game out to almost two hours by continuously preventing anyone from winning.  I wasn't even trying to win by the end of it, I just wanted to see how many people I could provoke.

I lost two friends that night.

The next game I lost one more.  Point being, if you are Lawful Evil and play this game you will lose a friend.  If you are Chaotic Evil and play this game, you will lose a few.  However, if you are that rare Chaotic Neutral who just likes to see what happens when you pour the gasoline on your own funeral pyre, you may just lose them all.

I do not find the theme amusing. That is, I recognise it could amuse me, since I'm what you might consider 'target audience'... But it does not. The theme was simply dragged too far - there's just so much 'goofiness' that it ceases to be even remotely funny.

Unfortunetly, Munchkin isn't much of a game without the 'oh so funny theme'. You just sit there drawing cards from a pile and that's it.

Munchkin is one of the games that started me on this road of nerdition.  I used to play D&D and Dragonspawn in high school so I naturally found Munchkin amusing.  The description on the box is accurate: Munchkin "captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff."

Munchkin is random, simple fun with players whining and backstabbing each other.  I still find a lot of the jokes amusing, but the game is not as fun as it used to be.

A fun, humorous game that goes on just a little too long for my attention span. Cool theme, good items, knowing smiles; Munchkin is good times.

Edit: The more I play/think about Munchkin, the less I like it. Its charm comes from the the cards, and, once that wears off, you have an ok game that goes on for waaaaay toooooo loooooonnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg.

Not as bad as I was expecting; a pleasant beer-and-pretzels game.  But the cards could be designed better, the rules could be written more clearly, and it's kind of ridiculous that the box doesn't come with level markers or a die, so I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 out of spite.

If you like games where you win by screwing over the other players rather than by doing well on your own merits, you'll love this game. It is possible to have a lot of fun with this game (and the cards are really funny), but it usually devolves into a pointless game of bash whoever's it the lead.

RATING: 7
This was "the" game in college. I think it matched my maturity level. This game is hilarious. It can be a little slow in the beginning, but it always leads to an exciting finish. I agree that the game does end the same way every time; The first player to 10 gets dog-piled, and the second/third player wins. I played it before Catan, but I wouldn't call it my gateway because I didn't realize that it led to anything else (except more munchkin).

RATING: 5.5
I have played some amazing games of Munchkin, but I have also played some downright horrible, overly-long, tedious and boring games of Munchkin. The engine is way too random for there to be any consistency and as a result I cannot give it more than a 5.5.

RATING: 2
I don't want to hate on this game too much - there are plenty of other comments for that. The art is cute, and at times even clever, but every game I've played follows the same progression: everything is fine up until someone gets close to winning, then it's "they're winning, get 'em!" and everyone piles on the leader knocking them down a bit. Then someone else gets close to winning, and it's "get 'em" all over again. This continues until the sun expands to engulf the earth and we all expire as a species ... deep breath ... (calm, calm). Anyhow, if this were a 30 minute game, I'd love it, but as it stands it's so f-ing long that it actually reduces the fun-level of the entire universe by a measurable amount (calm ... calm ... you got rid of the game and don't ever have to play it again ... peace)

[Jackson] What nearly redeems this game is the fact that it is honest about "goal" of a monty haul D&D gamer: to get the most stuff and be the most powerful player. Weak comedy value does not redeem lame design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Munchkin still gets played a bit when friends who are afraid of my Euros come over. It's still a fine game, and when played infrequently, the jokes stay pleasantly fresh. It's just that I own two dozen higher-rated games and am unlikely to play it under other circumstances.

It's worth noting, though, that original Munchkin, without expansions, can be a brutal, tactical, sneaky battle, especially when played by overcompetitive folks. With one expansion, I feel this reaches a comfortable compromise; with more, it waters down the game and turns it into a card lottery.

The main flaws with Munchkin are that it takes a bit too long, and almost always leaves 1-2 players card-poor (due to drawing high-level enemies their first few turns).  I need to try a game with a draft of starting equipment/class/races, maybe beginning at level 3 to compensate (and shorten the game)

Munchkin is a game that is pretty fun, when you play it for the first time. But the more you play it, the more you become aware of the dull and random mechanisms. At some point, you've seen all the funny cards and then there is not much left to enjoy. However, this can be a funny game, when played in the right group (guess that can be said about every game). People, who never played Munchkin, and start to cheer and giggle when all those hilarious cards come up, are preferred.

RATING: 2
The illustrations are great, and the jokes are pretty funny the first time you see them. But that's only justification enough to look through a copy of the game that some other sap shelled out money for.

The game is completely random, without any real strategy. Its leveling system helps the rich get richer, but not fast enough to end the game until long after the jokes have completely lost their luster. By the time one player has reached level 5, you can be virtually certain he will get to level 10 first and win -- but it's going to take a long while for that to happen.

Most people hate this game, I rather like it. It was one of my first non-Catan/Monolpoly/Clue/etc... games I played and I loved it. More importantly it allowed me to find more friends who liked it, and helped push me down this rabbit hole. Back to the game itself, it's hella random who wins. Constant backstabbing, the endgame is everyone ganging up on whomever's turn it is until the group is out of resources to stop someone, so a real crapshoot.

Fun card game. Great in the early-mid game but starts to drag in the late-game. This is mainly due to the action slowing down as everyone has to gang up on people to stop them from winning. Then one person gets to fight a ridiculously easy monster and just wins without contest. Card balance can be a problem without modifications.

One of the first games I bought(along with TTR and Citadels) after finding the geek.  Also, my least favorite game(by a large margin) I've bought since finding the geek.

Fiddly reading, clunky rules, no interesting decisions until someone goes for lvl 10 and everyone dumps their cards to prevent it.  Massive amounts of upside-down card reading. Just plain torture.

Art is fun to look at.  Wish I had thought of it or been the artist... cashing in on the yuck.

Good game, even with only two players. The base rules are pretty straight forward, though unclear card wording may cause some disputes/discussions/research which will slow down gameplay.

I think Munchkin is a great game, BUT its not serious AT ALL, and if you go into the game wanting something serious and challenging, then you are going to be disappointed.  HOWEVER, if you want a zany game where you get to screw over your friends and kill ridiculous monsters, armed with even more ridiculous equipment, then this is the game for you.  Like many other games, this game is largely based on luck, so if you draw badly, the game can seem nearly impossible, but if you draw well, then you can coast to victory.

The game itself is cheeky, cute, and childish in a somewhat fun way.  It would make for a fun 10-15 minute party game.  But a typical game of Munchkin drags out to 45 minutes to an hour, under the pretense that it's a strategic exercise, when in fact players can gang up on each other at their whims and knock each other down arbitrarily.  

Munchkin is trying not to take itself seriously, but then lasts long enough that it should.  This makes it a bad party game (too long) AND a bad strategy game (too whimsical).  And that's not a good place to be.

Poor.  The cards are funny, but the gameplay is extremely tedious.  Solution: thumb through cards, put back in box, move on.

Supposedly Munchkin-with-a-time-limit is a lot more fun (either 60 minutes then highest level wins, or shuffle a "game over" card into the bottom half of the deck).  But I doubt I'll ever find out.

Talk about diminishing marginal utility.  For those of you weren't econ majors, diminishing marginal utility is the minimizing of enjoyment with each successive action.  Example.  Butterfingers.  Taste great with the first bite, start feeling sticky teeth with second bite, feel like barfing after wolfing down a movie theater sized serving.  Alas, I must compare the classic game of Munchkin to that Bart Simpson staple confection.  After my first playing at the san diego comic-con, where a grizzled, overweight, under-bathed man whipped out a severely wrinkled, kids-sized Munchkin shirt to start the game and said in Simpson's Comic Guy voice "I can attempt to put it on, but it won't be pretty." I would have rated this game an instant 10.  Indeed I bought the game at the convention and picked up the subsequent expansions.  Sadly, with time, the magic of that comic-con moment has slowly dwindled away and has left me with naught but fond memories of my 1st spiked cod piece.

We really gave this game a chance. Played it many many times but possibly because of the nature of our game group it just got worse the more we played it mostly because the unclear rules regarding some of the combinations of cards. Our games started to last 2-3 hours and involved so much arguing about rules (which is something that normally lessens the more you play, but here there is always something new to argue about). 

Finally decided that it's not worth the hassle anymore. I do however think that in other groups this could play well. Maybe with people who don't care too much about the rules and can easily implement house rules. I know other groups who say that a game of munchkin lasts about 30 minutes - I have no idea how they do it :)

Luckiest player wins, unless he gets screwed by people saving their "you don't win" cards.  Then the second luckiest wins, or the next guy who draws a level 1 dustbunny and is at level 9 with +25 in bonuses.  Bleh.  If the entire game were retooled and it had different uses for levels, treasure, etc., then I think it would be a good game.  As is, not so good.

I find this to be an extremely unfun game. It devolves into everyone screwing over a person trying to get that last level. The game only ends once everyone has no ability to prevent a player from making a last kill. This is worse than just king-making. The game encourages repeatedly dog-piling the leading player. 

I give the game credit for the humorous feel. The art, card names and most mechanics all play to the goofy D&D parody. Sadly this game will always be taken to seriously because it is a game about being a Munchkin, which goes completely counter to the goofy appearance.

Munchkin scores high in my book because I have always been an avid role-player and this game just hits home. The parody is very well done, John Kovalic's artwork is great. The game is enjoyable to play, especially if you try to role-play it out a bit for fun. It can suck if you get super teamed up on. That last level can be a bi#$%!

Card designs are great and filled with a lot of humor.  Once the novelty of the cards wear out the game itself is pretty meh.  You mainly just screw with each other as much as possible and try to sprint to victory as fast as you can to avoid others screwing with you.  Definitely play this game at some point to experience the hilarious cards... but in hindsight I rather would have played some one else's copy and not own it myself as it mostly just sits on my shelf.  I whip it out only when people specifically want to try it and have an ok time with it.  Not bad but just never a game I want to play anymore.

I'm all for getting into the spirit of the game, but this game can be ruined by actually playing with real Munchkins.  The game is better if you've invested a couple of years playing Dungeons & Dragons -- much of the humor will be lost otherwise, which is a big part of this game.

My kids love this game. I think it's decent. It's definitely not one of the best games that we own. It's never on the top of my list of things I want to play. Sometimes, I refuse to play it because it's extremely luck-based and gameplay is not very deep. Games can feel very similar. However, when I do play it with them, it's always good for a few laughs with the silliness and backstabbing. If I were rating it for just myself, I'd rate it lower, but I think it has a lot of appeal for people who like "Take That" play and fart jokes. After they played it a few times, it really hasn't come out again, much to my relief.

Only the base-set + five players = a total over-death-game-night. Actually it was a blast for several hours non stop. The card deck cycled quite rapidly and with only a few high-up monsters there was some sort of suspension whether or not one draws the Platinum Dragon...and be gone. Totally beer'n'pretzel stuff. With more expansions it gets rather watered down. Thus I'd give it only a 6. Oh, and one definatelly needs "evil, against-others I-stab-you-in-the-back" gamers to truly enjoy this game.

We found this game to be a lot of fun... at first.  After a few plays, it got pretty repetive, and it's been doing nothing but collecting dust for a few months.

RATING: 6
A really fun game. Best with more people. It is silly, addicting and most usually a blast to play. The problem is that this game always falls into the same old trap. Somebody tries to win only for them to be shut down. That is not the issue. The issue is that the person who usually wins is the one who was lucky enough that everyone used their worst cards on somebody else. So maybe play in moderation.

I loved this game 10 years ago. I didn't know any better.

But upon repeat plays the game plays itself since the best moves are pretty obvious. The humor of the game is very clever but not enough to keep you coming back again and again. Also the combination of a high luck factor, take that game play, and king making is a big negative for me. 

One of the cornerstones of the game is arguing over how the rules apply to specific cards and actions. This too is amusing at first but gets tiresome over time.

*Update: Gave my copy to a friend who actually likes this game.

A very fun game to play every now and then.  I started with the deluxe edition, and I think it was definitely worth the few extra dollars (gives it more of a board game feel with the dungeon and tokens).  My friends and I enjoy it so much I've bought several expansions (both for fantasy Munchkin, + Star Munchkin, etc.). You can't take it too seriously.  It's not about winning, it's about having fun sticking it to the other players and have them stick it to you  There are a lot of ways this can happen and I always enjoy seeing how it's going to happen next.

Way too complicated for how stupid it is. On the surface it has some good ideas...go through a dungeon, kill some monsters, loot the place, ect ect. But the execution is terrible. Its all about lucky card draws. Which would be ok but the cards are too wordy and there are too many exceptions you have to look up to see if you are playing the game right. Its just too clunky and chaotic to be any fun. The cards are kinda funny, I'll give it that. I doubt another play would change my mind so I probably won't play it again.

I find it fun with 2-4 players, any higher then that then your asking for a headache.          Clearly the arguing about the rules was a joke, but still arguing over obscure things like if a Thief can steal multiple times when someone else is in combat. Or switching your class when someone else is in combat to use a special ability etc.          Other then that its a solid game.

RATING: 5
(As of [b]?[/b] plays) I used to be enamoured of the Munchkin series, which was partially responsible for bringing me to BGG, but it is certainly a game where familiarity can breed contempt. The humour is great, the artwork is perfect, and the concept of reducing the role-playing experience to its shallowest component elements is fun. The fatal flaw is the directionless randomness and the tortuously prolonged time it takes to finish a game.

[b]5 year verdict:[/b] Munchkin was one of the first non-traditional games I bought, and I played a lot of it early on, but I have definitely moved on.

Munchkin is a cheesy game that offers a few smiles to those with an affection for fantasy roleplaying. Distilling the experience to selfish card play may seem incongruent, but it works.

I've had games where drawing a monster of an appropriate level to fight took far too long. Seeing a player go from moderate Level 5-6 to Level 1 can be upsetting... though looting the body rarely is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Totally random. Flip over a card and do what it says. I gain one level? Great. I lose one level? Why? - Just because. So much fun... Can really drag at the end because everyone is beating on the leader which can unnecessarily prolong the game by another 20 minutes.  I have actually let people win this even though I could have foiled their attempt to reach level 10. But since I was at level 4, it seemed like a waste of time. You see, if one player wins, everyone wins because the game is over.

Each card has tons of text that must be read which really slows down the game. Dislike the art as well and I don't care much for the attemps at humor. The lack of any clear rules structure makes me insane. You can basically do anything you want, which coupled with the total randomness can be hugely frustrating.

RATING: 7
A light card game with lots of RPG jokes.  Only fun if you don't take it seriously, and treat it as a social experience rather than a thoughtful board game, because it is somewhat random and dependent on luck-of-thedraw, and is more about negotiation and diplomacy than strategic long-term planning (so if you don't like Fluxx, you probably won't like Munchkin either).  It's appeal is the interaction/negotiating, and the humor.  Munchkin is most amusing the first time around if you're not familiar with the cards/jokes, the jokes can wear thin with multiple playing.  For best results, form alliances or assist players to advance several levels before beginning the back-stabbing.  To shorten the game, use a time limit (eg one hour total, or 10 more minutes after a player reaches level 9), or create an End Game card which ends the game when turned up and initiates Player vs Player combat for tied players to determine a winner.  We play with a house rule that you can't curse other players or do nasty stuff until they're at least level 4.  Best with 4-5 players? 

Expansions owned:
[gameid=3943] - Adds new race: Orcs.  
[gameid=6606] - Adds new race: Gnome.  Adds new class: Bard.
[gameid=20660] - Adds: Steeds.  Even more Munchkin!

Not a broken game, just an obnoxious game.

You know 'that kid' who shows up, screams the entire time, and thinks he's the funniest person you'll ever meet?  Meet that, The Card Game.

You could get as much (if not more) enjoyment out of this game by just reading the cards.  The tropes they identify are real, and there's humor in that.  The game?  Not so much.  There's no reason to use your attacks until someone is an actual threat.  that means everyone reserves their shit and blasts the first person who could make it to 10.  There's usually enough left over that the second person also gets ass-blasted.  So, the best strategy is to happen to be the third person who could make it to 10, because then enough people will have exhausted themselves that you can win... an hour later.

Too long for a quick-laugh game.

A game that's fun to play maybe once per year, and only if you play it for laughs. 

I've never seen a game more prone to disfunction. Aggressive, negative player interaction is encourage not only by many cards (which allow you to screw other players over), but also by the game itself (you are allowed to cheat and to bully other players, threatening to screw them over if they don't give you treasures). Games tend drag because people usually gang up on whoever seems to be running away at the moment, which can become frustrating for the current leader. As if all that wasn't bad enough, fortune plays an enormous role in Munchkin: you could draw powerful cards and build combos, or you could end up with a useless hand (high level monsters that you can't defeat nor throw against other players, multiple classes when you can only play one, etc.). Not my definition of an enjoyable game.

The first few times I played this game I didn't like it much. But I was playing it wrong; I was playing to win. Now I play it just to have fun, with all of the weird combinations that come out, and trying to figure out how to stop the leader (often unsuccessfully). I don't play this game much, because I need the right group of people to play with (my wife, for example, refuses to play it with me), but when I get the right group together it can be a blast. Edit: My son, Nathan, loves this game and we have been playing it more often. We often choose just a couple of expansions to play with, and I have also set aside several cards we always play with, particularly those that defend against combat interference and give more hands and feet.

I hate it when people want to play this game. It is so incredibly boring and takes forever. The box says 1 hour but it's more like 3 to 10. In that time I can play a real game instead. If it only was a 15-20 minute game it could be used as the filler game it initially looks like.

Fun to read the cards the first time you play each set because some of the cards are pretty funny, but game lasts too long once for what it is once you know the cards. I hide this from my friends so we can play something else.

Played it once, didn't understand the turn sequence and all the rules, dissed it.Played it again out of the box with my usual gaming gang (all of us for the first time) and really dug it.Can and will be a great time with the right group. I can understand the (genuine) humor of the cards my wear thin - but there are so many expansions it would be impossible to tire completely of it.It (obviously) is highly interactive and I do certainly agree that it is more about experiencing Munchkin than winning it.

Munchkin is a special beast.  I wouldn't describe it as a GOOD game.  But I usually enjoy playing it?  Granted, it is always being pulled out at 11:30pm, and no one is in the mood to finish it.  Game rarely feels as though it is the right length.

I think Munchkin is really cool and I would want to play it regularly with folks that know how to play. I think this approach to Munchkin is was disqualifies me as being a fan. Also, I think you need to have some DnD experience to make any sense of this game. Folks playing this who have zero rpg experience can't make sense of some of the concepts - especially just plain boardgamers.

This is a very good light card game.
Rules are easy to follow, got great humor (especially if you know Dunguons&Dragons, because the jokes are mostly based on that RPG)

The game is made balanced, because all the cards are unbalanced, so that evens out.

EDIT: lowered the score, because after repeated plays the jokes wear off and the fun is a bit less. Still a fun game though!

I hesitate to call Munchkin a "good" game, but it certainly can be fun given the right group of people, especially if they are able to have fun with the silly D&D/fantasy puns in the cards.  The game is definitely a rip off, since you only get some cards and a D6 for $25 or so (Steve Jackson didn't even have the courtesy to include something to use a level counters in the box, meaning you'll need a bunch of pennies or something), but the game is incredibly easy and non-intimidating for larger groups of non-gamers, and can get pretty competitive and intense towards the end, even though there isn't a lot of skill involved.

Played 1 time. I know that this might still be the novelty factor speaking, but I did like this game. It has tons of action cards, and interesting combat because players who meet a formidable monster can appeal to the other players for help with the incentive of rewards. Still largely a "take that" game, but with more players, it sort of balances out since all players need to keep each other in check. I enjoyed it well enough with 5 players, but further playing with less players will tell me a lot more about the game.

I've played several different iterations of Munchkin over the years.  The base game is still, IMO, the best.  I bought a couple expansions, and I don't play with them. Its not as fun.

One downside is that if you're playing with all experienced players, 120 minutes is a rather low estimate for play time.  I played this on Thanksgiving.  The game lasted 3 1/2 hours, and we all knew what we were doing.  It could have even gone longer, but I decided to let it end and not play a card that would have delayed the victory longer.  6 players, all level 9, all with hands filled with things to stop others from killing a monster and winning.  It just lost its fun at the end.

Pros
-My gateway game
-Fantasy theme parody, pro if you're into that

Cons
-Massive amount of king-making
-Being in first place early is a negative. Also leads to game dragging on and feeling very long for what you get done (from 30 mins to 3 hours)
-Very random. You draw from a deck of monsters ranging from level 1 to 20 (their level is also their strength)
-Very vague rules (I've seen many groups play it differently)
-Expansions add no new mechanics, overpriced game
-Low art quality

This was funny exactly once, and I'm a D&D vet of 20 years! It rapidly went downhill after that. One play and done. I can imagine how it would go over with a crowd of players who never played D&D: it probably won't. Without the funny, it's just another random game that takes too damned long to play out. I'd rather lop my own head off with a Holy Avenger +5 than play Munchkin again.

Best party game I've played. My whole family is hooked on it, and after about 6 games, everyone got so excited and into it, we went out and bought 2 expansion packs with a gift card I got for my birthday. 
Only thing is that there are a few cards that are a bit raunchy, but still great times. Being an artist, I would love to do some fan art of some of the characters people have with the items equipped would make for some very interesting drawings. O_O

A quick filler game that won't turn away non-gamers or casual gamers.

The rules are quite easy to understand and it's a "just jump right in and learn as you go" type of game.  The most fun in this game comes from the forced social interaction of forming alliances and back-stabbing.

Not a game to be used as the center piece of a game party, but easily a side game for late-comers, or the less addicted RPG/Strategy gamers of the group.

Awesome game! I&#039;m a big old RPG geek and the cheesy humor in this game was right up my alley. That along with the back stabbing and wheeling and dealing (and blackmail) going on add up to make this tons of fun for me. The only gripe I have with it is the price. For what they charge you could at LEAST give me color cards. But still, a very enjoyable game and one I&#039;ll be picking up as soon as I can scrape the cash together to do so.

The cards are really funny and well illustrated. The mechanism is quite simple and make for a light game. Unfortunately, I think it is simply "too light". The fun is essentially to read the cards as you play them and laugh together at their silliness. So it's not really a game I would play again but I guess it's not as bad as some others since it makes you laugh at least once!

Munchkins is a strange beast. Your distribution of goods is heavily luck-based, yet if you're good enough at bargaining/bluffing you can win at this game pretty consistently. It goes far too long for my tastes, and anything over 4 players creates too much down-time and too much chaos. 2 player doesn't work at all without completely overhauling the rules.

At 3 or 4 players this game can be good for some light-medium strategy. It's got a whole ton of luck, but if you get your favorite themed version it can be a good social game.

"Munchkin" est un curieux objet ludique. Par son ambiance, son thème, son humour, ses illustrations et ses règles un peu délirantes et variables selon les joueurs, il fait d'abord penser à un party game. Mais pour un party game, il est bien trop long. Le principal problème du jeu se tient dans ce paradoxe.

J'y ai beaucoup joué au lycée, en parallèle aux "Magic", deux univers assez différents donc, qui ne demandent pas la même approche. En tout cas, on s'éclatait bien, les cartes et même les règles sont vraiment amusantes et dans un esprit de dérision du jeu de rôle bienvenu. On ne respectait pas forcément ces règles, d'ailleurs, n'hésitant pas à les transgresser pour rendre le tout encore plus bordélique.

C'est donc l'aspect "party game" de la chose, avec comme point fort la sociabilisation autour de la table, le jeu étant plein d’interactions.. Mais le problème, comme mentionné plus haut, c'est que pour finir réellement une partie, ça prend un temps fou qui n'est pas à la mesure du plaisir pris. C'est du plaisir immédiat, qui doit s'arrêter rapidement, qui dure sur le court terme. Le jeu, lui s'étend sur le long terme et finalement, on s'ennuie de plus en plus, l'amusement laissant la place à une routine peu innovante et peu intéressante, laissant une énorme place au hasard sans qu'on puisse réellement le contrôler et les tours se ressemblant trop pour renouveler l'intérêt au cours de la partie.

Un jeu qui soulève d'agréable souvenirs, mais qui, malgré ses qualités, aurait mérité d'être retravaillé afin de faire correspondre esprit de jeu et temps de la partie.

This is a bad game. It took me a while to realise it was bad, hence all the expansions...
The game involves no real strategy and usually draws out way beyond its welcome. Often people would say:
"Let's play again. I get the strategy now." which *always* results in hour long stalemates. Quality gameplay, right there... -_-
The artwork is awful and the game inherently makes fun of the people who are most likely to be playing it.

RATING: 2
A totally random game. Players start with random equipment and random cards that might make them useful or useless. Each turn, the player draws a random card and if they're lucky enough to run into a monster they fight it or else they get to actually draw a card.
Players are supposed to discuss and bargain, but since each player wants the same things, there is minimal value to bargaining and bartering.
In a smaller game, the first player to reach the level ten goal will be bashed down by everyone and the second will walk to victory scott free. Larger games may be doomed to circle the drain endlessly as there are enough players to restock hand-sizes between beatdowns.

Un très bon jeu, rempli de momment mémorable. Mais comme tout jeux ayant pour objectif d'être drôle sa plus grande force en devient sa plus grande faiblesse. Plus on joue, moins le jeu est drôle, et quand on le joue aussi souvent que je l'ai fait ... il devient méchanique et inintéressant.

A very good game , filled with memorable momment . But like any game that aims to be funny in his greatest strength is his greatest weakness . The more you play , the less the game is funny, and when we play it as often as I did ... it becomes mechanical and uninteresting .

Being born as a parody of RPGs, Munchkin is really really funny to play, many cards made me lough sincerely! There are plenty of expansions! Apart from the humoristic idea the game is still enjoyable, maybe it loses some grip when the cards are well known.

Played a couple of times.  This game sucks because it quickly degenerates into a 'bash the leader'-fest until finally people run out of screwage cards and one person can't be kept from the win. Dumb, dumb, dumb.  However, if you ever played D&D, you should pick up a deck and read the jokes on the cards, by far the best aspect of this game.

I bought this two years (October 2004!) before I discovered my first Eurogames  (eg Carcassonne & Settlers) and my friends booed me after we played it for 10 minutes.  So, finally snuck in a two player game, It's sort of ok (24/04/09). UPDATE: Like the concept, but just doesn't seem to work quick enough and quickly out stays It's welcome (rating 5) (23/10/11). UPDATE: Actually, the game ain't that bad - - bit of light fun for three at least (rating increase to 6; 17/11/12). UPDATE:  This is probably my borderline game; anything worse should probably leave the collection.  Entry includes all themed variants I own (Star Munchkin & Ninja) as all in one box.  Strange thing this game, its just ok, but I still want to like it much more because of the concept and theme (Rating: 6.087; Sept 16)

Don't play this game if you have thin skin as it can be very cut-throat and you will constantly be blocked by other players. However, the cards and monsters in this game are very funny and you can choose to help or hinder players. Like Fluxx, this game is ridiculous and the puns appeal to my sense of humour. Fairly quick game play. I also have a few small expansions for fresh laughs.

This game relies heavily on the mood of the players: if people are too serious or not in the right spirit then it can become a very dull or antagonistic game. But when people are feeling fun and the cards are good it can provide some of the best moments in board gaming.

To borrow someone else's description "10 minutes of fun stuffed into 2 hours of game." Plays like every other Steve Jackson card game. 1st & 2nd players that try to win don't and usually the 3rd or 4th try wins it. Amusing to read cards but game play is aweful. Sadly his games are the first things new gamers want to play because they just don't know any better. Have patience (don't roll your eyes) and sneak in a real game.

RATING: 6
Fun, but for reasons that largely have nothing to do with the game itself. The worst sin Munchkin commits is length - it can just drag on FOREVER. ESPECIALLY if you play with one or more expansions added on to it. I seriously suggest you only ever play with one set at a time, and if you need to mix it up a bit, only do so with key groups of cards (e.g. adding the sharks from Munchkin Booty to the main set, and nothing else, works well). Also, this is not a game to treat with reverence - violate the cards, create your own, screw around with the rules. Really Munchkin falls into familiar problems as a game - kingmaker, "screw-the-leader", never ending stalemate. Like Killer Bunnies, you'll never enjoy this unless you turn your brain off, stop caring about the win condition, and just use it as a hang-outs enhancer.

On one hand, I don't think this game deserves quite as much hate as it gets from various corners of the internet. On the other hand, however, I do think the game is severely flawed. I understand the gateway appeal of the game, I just wish there was a little bit more to it than there is. If there was some sort of strategic choice to be made, it would be more interesting to me, but in most cases the choice is in the hands of other players which rarely feels all that good.

Not bad at all,

Munchkin at first glance, in my opionion is kinda underwhelming. First off, the game is not so simple as it is intially portrayed. Some of the cards offer a bit of a chuckle, but kinda get old after a few games.  However, when you get going with a few other people and into the game, the hype suddenly becomes apparent. The game is a blast to play with three or more people. Helping people and back stabbing them afterwards. This game became an instant classic amongst my collection despite some of the subtle nuances.

Munchkin has single handedly brought more new people into advanced gaming than any other game I own. I will often times drop it on the table and let the new people play while I watch (or play other stuff on the side) and then wait for the "what else do you got?" phrase to pop up.  However official fast play rules are a must to keep the game brisk.

I don't understand the antipathy some people have for this game. Sure, there isn't deep strategy, and games can go a little long sometimes, but it's still one of my favorites. Things I like about it include:

  1. the cute and humorous cards

  2. that it's the best of the "take that" mechanic games I've played. It's enormous fun when people pile on to the leader.

  3. that it has the flavor of an RPG dungeon crawler without the need for a dense rulebook.

This isn't really a game.  I mean, it's something to do while hanging out with friends, but I don't really feel like there's a lot of complexity here.  I don't feel like I matter when I play it, I'm just going through the motions.  This allows me to interact with my friends more, and make fun of what's going on, but I could do that without the this particular distraction just as easily.

RATING: 6.5
Munchkin was the gateway that got me into board games as an adult. I had a lot of fun playing it, and a purchased a lot of expansions. Unfortunately, I found that the game does not hold up well to multiple plays. 

I'm not talking about the jokes getting old or anything either. I still love the John Kovalic art, and I still chuckle at the jokes.

The problem is that you find that the game turns into a "kingmaker scenario" where there are multiple players sitting at level 9, and it's just a matter of which player you want to use all of your "take that" types of cards on, leaving the remaining player (whether you or your neighbor) as the de facto winner. 

Additionally, while Munchkin is thought of as a "Beer and Pretzels" casual game, pretty much after you play it a handful of times and play other games, you'll realize that there are better games out there that fall into the "Beer and Pretzels" casual category.

This has all yet to mention that when you do play with experienced players, what should be a 30 minute game literally drags on for 2 hours or more. I said above that I actually like the art and the jokes, but not for as long as this game drags on.

If you like tabletop gaming but want to avoid all that pesky roleplaying, Munchkin is the game for you. Hack 'n slash to your heart's content and grab as much loot as you can. It's definitely one of those games that gets much better with more people as a key component is getting other players to help defeat monsters (for a share of the treasure, of course). Steve Jackson has done a great job of keeping the mechanics and rules lighthearted and cultured an air of good natured competitiveness.

RATING: 5
People seem to have a real love-hate relationship with this game.  The tongue-in-cheek humor poking fun at fantasy games makes it a novelty, and it's simplicity is something to be admired.  However, at its core this is a classic game of screwing your opponent to win a victory.  Not a game for cry babies.  Also, I think Munchkin suffers from one too many expansions and nick-knacks (over 60 at last count).  UPDATE: I brought this one on vacation and unfortunately the game (and jokes) did not age well for me.  I don't anticipate doing much with the game at this point.

It was fun the first time, when I was figuring it out. And the second time, when I was implementing what I learned. After that? This is a just a wait-out game at the end. Only real "strategy" is to try to accumulate cards and then hope your opponents run out of blockers right before your turn when you're at 9.

I imagine it's more fun if you're a bit drunk and can enjoy the theme.

Being a recovering PnP addict (16 years sober) this game lets me get my fantasy fix while making enough fun of it that my family and friends love it too.  Wife, preppy recovering "woo girl", loves it too because of the ability to mess with people (see her favorite Dominion card above).

Despite the negative reviews, very fun game (especially for non-D&D players - but those into RPG-type games like WOW), constantly gets requested to be played again, not a game you expect to win at (bash-the-leader type) which adds to the fun but can also add to the game being cumbersome at times; cheating is fun.

Initial Rating: 7

I still think it could be fun to pull this one out for a quick, chaotic, humorous dungeon hack. The problem is that it isn't quick, or even just a bit too long. There is a real problem with both the beginning of the game where nothing productive seems to happen for a long time, and then the endgame that just drags on and on.
We had fun the first few times we played this, bu now I don't really expect playing this again without some kind of variant for a shorter game.

Sure it's comparatively random, but I really do enjoy the mechanics and how  suprisingly balanced it is when you combine every set.  Good, light fun, and having a good grasp on the mechanics and the cards significantly boosts one's win percentage.  Played many, many, many times.

Note: Since we play with all the sets owned combined, all plays are logged under Munchkin Blender.

Playing Munchkin is better than hearing a loud bang when flying on a jet just before a flaming suitcase slams into your face, wrenching you out of your seat so you go flying down the middle aisle hitting seats and passengers all the way to the howling patch of sky that used to be the tail of the plane, where you pop out and plummet into the jaws of an angry hippopotamus with your eyebrows on fire.

I figured all the negative karma dumped on this game was from eurosnoots, but in this case the game does suck.  If it were half the length it would be good for 5-10 plays so people could read/experience all the gags and have a few laughs. But it's far too long and the components suck (brown on brown? wth?) so I can't really recommend it to anyone other than maybe to have them browse the cards for a snicker.

Munchkin è, probabilmente, il più avvincente e cattivo gioco di carte non collezionabili. È un attimo passare dalla vittoria alla più totale sconfitta seguita subito dalla derisione del mostro che vi ha appena schiacciato. I vostri amici al tavolo poi, diverranno i vostri peggiori nemici o migliori alleati (queste si invertiranno continuamente). Strategico e di fortuna, Munchkin assicura il divertimento ed è facile da spiegare!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I've played this half a dozen times so far, mostly with my brothers.  It's light and funny and unique in that sometimes the best strategy isn't to win the game, but to have more fun messing with your opponents.  :-)  We added 2 expansions to the deck already just to make sure it doesn't get stale too fast.  Not the best game, but an enjoyable time with a group with the right joking mindset.  There isn't a whole lot of planning or strategy involved.  Just a screw your neighbor game with goofy curses and gotchas.

UPDATE: I'm pretty much done with this game.  I'm struggling to get my brothers to level up to more interesting games.  They might not be the best gaming group for that, though :)

UPDATE: Despite selling my copy of this game, my brother brought his own copy to Brother's (Game) Night.  Ugg!  We played Forbidden Desert, Pandemic and Munchkin... and Munchkin took longer to play than the first two COMBINED!  I can't stand it!  I'm desperate to get my brothers to level-up their gaming interest beyond this.

We only play Munchkin once a month, mainly because it can easily take 3 hours or more before somebody wins. While turns can be at times rather tedious, the endgame (the last hour or so) tends to be really exciting, with constant attacks and unexpected counterattacks. The deck (even when playing with expansions) is very well-balanced, and if you know when to play your cards you can easily stop somebody from winning (people often complain about this, but I think that this is Munchkin's stronger point). Adding expansions (and mixing cards from other munchkin games) is a must.

You'll take it down from the shelf, remember what fun you had with it the last time you played, (like, back in the 90's) and after looking through the cards you realize the art, humor, and design has grown long grey whiskers, and the game itself creaks and groans along like a geriatric swordsman who can no longer get it up.
Yes, I went there.

Good game to play with the kids, even though they don't have the RPG experience to get most of the jokes. Pretty simple to play once you get the hang of it and get used to some of the cards. Though it can drag on forever if there is a lot of backstabbing.

A silly game that has rules that are written oddly, making it hard to figure out what the real rules are.  I did like the fact that you have to negotiate with other players about them helping you to fight the monsters, but overall I didn't like this game that much. (a little too silly for my taste)

My favorite thing about Munchkin is that you never know what you're going to get when you sit down to a game. Munchkin is a chaotic mess that shouldn't work as a game, but in the end it somehow does - provided you have a fun sociable group who aren't just focused on "win-win-win!" The game constantly forces players to either adapt or die, and dying is rarely that bad.

This was my gateway back into tabletop gaming. Even though I have played better games, this one will always remain dear.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I can see why it's popular with people that aren't as much into tabletop. There's a lot of comedy and there's some nice room for negotiation/working together in the early/mid game.

The problem is that this game basically devolves into people throwing everything they have at the one person about to win, which sometimes sets them back a few levels and just makes the game drag on.

I dislike when games overstay their welcome.

On the same day that I decided to rate Munchkin after playing it once twelve years ago, I actually played it with players who were familiar with it. It wasn't so bad. In a sense it was a forerunner to later games like San Juan or RTFG, or even Glory to Rome in a way, but without the same level of structure. It was entertaining.

Deprecated: One of the most boring and unappealing games I have ever played. That said, I admit to formerly owning every Killer Bunnies deck, and I'm not sure they are conceptually much different. I ended up giving away KB for the same reason that I dislike Munchkin—fun idea but slow and lumbering (bunny) in practice.

Take That!

Play fast, or it can be a slog. Nice for getting everyone involved, simple to start but with enough depth to keep people interested. Feels masturbatory. Every play is unique in cards but often homogenous and draw out in conclusion: Everyone is close to winning and whoever takes a turn where no one has cards to stop them wins. Rules modification is easy and works well, doubling monster levels, adjusting cards drawn, or changing the winning level.

As with most monster-slaying games there are lots of moments of interesting surprises, but it's a kill-the-leader game that requires you to constantly attack the people you're playing with, and that means a long drawn-out game and pretty tiresome gameplay.

I am a fantasy-roleplay buff, and I get all the jokes. 

However, Munchkin always seems to drag on until everyone is level 8 or 9, and then the winner is the first to have a turn after people have burned all their hate from their hands. Too long for too few laughs, I will pick Guillotine any day

RATING: 3
I know this is a classic, but it suffers from a couple problems:

First, it's very much an "In Joke" for players of D&D 1st Edition.  If you're not an RPG player then the jokes are just silly names.

Second: The "stab your buddy" portion of the game play can be pretty harsh.  If playing with younger kids it can be demoralizing.   When playing with adults it tends to drag on.

Oft-maligned for being a game that is funny the first time and then loses it's appeal. Also for being a game that would be good if it lasted about 10 minutes instead of the 1-2 hours it can take (if you play with expansions particularly).

I like it. I agree it has replayability issues but it can definitely be a fun, light-hearted game to play. It can go on a little bit too long but if it's not fun any more I think people will just let the game end. It is expensive for what it is though.

OK someone had to do it, and Steve Jackson is always one for producing the goods on something that is so obvious that we all should have thought of it.  Good on him. One of those games that is so cool in the concept .. and yet - when you play it you just get bored and want it to finish.

RATING: 2
I just don't like it.  It's a shame, because most of my friends do, which means that I go off and do my thing (set up Descent, etc.) while they play.

While the first play was entertaining, Munchkin has too many things that detract.

- Wild luck swings
- Ganging up on the leader / kingmaking
- The inability to have control over basic character traits
- The inability to plan or strategize
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The original Munchkin is actually fairly weak compared to the sequels. The humor is a little weaker, the theme feels slightly disconnected and the card effects just aren't quite as fun. Several of the mini-expansions are really fantastic, though, and give the game a lot of what it's missing.  The deluxe edition is a really nice thing to have even for other editions - the board and the figures are fantastic and much nicer than always trying to improvise some way to track levels.

How many times have I played munchkin? Too many, I'm sure, and yet all always play one more time. By the time I got around to Munchkin, I was well aware of its reputation as a madness inducing take that game scantily clad in card art, rpg elements and juvenile humor. I had already been introduced to games such as Lords of Waterdeep, Game of Thrones, and Eldritch horror. This was undeniably a step down. And yet, sometimes a scrap in the dust is just what the doctor ordered. I despise this game at 6 players, but at 4 it really can be a lot of fun. However, I never end a game of Munchkin ready for another bout, and usually it takes at least a month for me to forget about the game's less desirable features in favor of its entertainment value. Eventually though, I always do.

I first played Munchkin at my first time attending Gamers of Winter in... 2010 I think? The first version I played was Super Munchkin, so that was the version I bought for our family. I later picked up the Axe Cop version as well.

My son Matthew LOVES Munchkin, so even though it has worn out its welcome with me, I bought him Munchkin Deluxe for his 11th birthday and he brings it with him to every gaming event we attend together.

Really fun, nice pictures. And sometimes it can be like a stick up your butt when your so called "friends" play certain cards. Really fun. 

I will not rank it higher though because it is a bit repetitive and you often are quite limited with what cards you draw, i.e. you are more in need of pure luck than boardgaming skills.

First real game my friends and I could play together.  We loved the theme and the humor.  Easy to pick up and play and the expansions provide a TON of content to change things up.

A very good entry level game. Simple to teach and play, requires little strategy, high luck base on what comes out of the deck.

Very group specific, fun with a light hearted group at the end of the night. Absolutely horrible with competitive people, vindictive people, or rules Nazis as some cards are very open to interpretation. 

Game can be painful if you don't acquire monsters, looting the room turns are far too common. Nothing really fun happens until the last few rounds as you try and save the offensive cards to the end as they are hard to come by.

Ok game, there are better.

Munchkin is a kind of "meta-D&D" game that I think is perfect for Beer & Pretzels fun. Always gets us laughing out loud. That said, the novelty of the cards doesn't hold up to repeated playthroughs, which is probably why there are so many expansions. I like this one a lot for what it is.

Ray

Edicion antigua (sepia) adquirida en compra conjunta (obsequio) con defectos. Reclamado a Edge.

Adquirida edicion nueva (color) usada. 

Varias expansiones adquiridas por Ray y otras Regalo a Ray de 2015. 

El famoso juego de cartas de "mata monstruos, roba el tesoro, apuñala a tus amigos". y efectivamente de eso anda la cosa: matar algunos bichos, robar algunos tesoros y putear bastante al projimo. 

el tono de humor del juego es chispeante, el juego es original y dinamico (especialmente considerando el hecho de ser, o al menos basarse en, un dungeon crawler). Pero literalmente, en ocasiones es excesivamente absurdo sobre todo cuando otros jugadores participan "puteando" para ayudar al monstruo y que derrote al jugador para bajarle el nivel. tampoco ayuda que en ciertas ocasiones de interaccion las reglas no son claras y dejan la patata caliente al propio jugador. 

dependiendo del grupo puede ser risas aseguradas toda la tarde o una pesadilla espantosa. 

A mi particularmente: lo encuentro gracioso un rato, pero como juego de mesa no me llena.

My kids love this game, but I'm only willing to play it in small doses spaced well apart.  This is one of those "screw over the other players" games in a big, big way, and I like cooperative games because I can be a bit of a bad sport when, for example, I get knocked from level 9 all the way back to level 1 by my kids teaming up to screw me over.  So, I have to insist on moderation with this very uncooperative game (if moderation means only playing it three times in a row).  But it is undeniably fun and clever and my kids sure love it.

Juego entretenido, sobre todo si vienes del mundo del Rol.

This game is pretty neat the first few times one plays, but I find the replay value to be a bit lacking.

We have had games of this go for as long as 2 1/2 hours (with five people.)  <shudder>

Munchkin: 15 Minutes of Fun Crammed into 2 Hours

Fairly amusing, but not a lot here in the way of strategy. You win by being the first to gain 9 levels, which you do by winning fights, which is easier at higher levels. So it has a runaway winner problem, while at the same time having no strategic choices to balance (just gain levels as fast as possible). The other player can gang up to a degree, but this only goes so far. My suspicion is that my rating would drop further after more plays.
UPDATE: Rating dropped. It's way too long for how much game there is.

  Played this a few times. The combat dynamic of just comparing two numbers seems... well too simple. The first few turns, it's almost impossible to start leveling up. Some player ALWAYS gets left behind, and charity doesn't help that much.
   Admittedly, that's part of it's charm. I'm always surprised how much player interaction gets generated (and admittedly, the game is really freaking funny). It's not an all-the-time game, but a decent one to play with friends who aren't deep into gamers.

Okay, we own Munchkin. We attempted 30 minutes of whatever Munchkin is. It's random, and not funny enough to warrant keep playing the random drawfest.

If you like mildly amusing cards and artwork and a random luck fest with tedious negotiating. This is for you!

It takes far too long to win once players start reaching 9 points. In the most recent game I was quite seriously tempted to throw the game by giving bonuses to aid other players just to end it quickly--particularly as I had absolutely no prospect of winning for the last hour. Not a game I will play again.

Munchkin is a fun game, great concept but is so broken. One single game for us took HOURS and HOURS to playthrough because of the constant back and forth backstabbing. Backstabbing is fine in a game but the opportunity to stop someone from winning comes up at every person's turn which makes the game last way too long. Would much rather play the Adventure Time Munchkin anyways.

This was the game that got me into board games. I don't really want to play it, but at the same time it's my "first kiss" so to say. It'll have a special place because of that.

I think this is a really fun game that just takes far too long to play. If it lasted 30 minutes, I'd probably play it quite often.

PL: Chyba najgenialniejsza spośród gier karcianych w które grałem. Świetnie komponuje się z piwem. Obrazki Kovalica, jak i żartobliwe opisy często powodują rechot wśród graczy. Gra o tym co tygryski lubią najbardziej: kradnij, kłam, oszukuj, spiskuj i nie daj się nakryć lub wyrolowac innym graczom. Sama podstawa z czasem się nudzi, bo zna sie już wszystkie karty. Pudełko aż się prosi o jakieś przegródki czy wytłoczki na karty. Mimo tych małych wad polecam każdemu, szczególnie osobom znającym klimat RPG.

EN: Probably the most ingenious of the card games that I played. Created to play when drinking beer. Pictures made by Kovalic and humorous descriptions often cause croaking among the players. A game is about what Tiggers like best: steal, lie, cheat, conspire and don't get caught by other players. This basic edition becomes little boring after a few games, because it is easy to remember all cards. Box cries out for some partitions or stampings for the cards. Despite these small flaws would recommend it to anyone, especially to those familiar with RPG atmosphere.

Cards are humorous, and my son and a couple friends like it.  I'll tolerate a play once in a while.  Seems like a whole lot of work until everyone gets to level 9, then the winner is the one whose opponent's run out of ways to stop him from getting to level 10.

RATING: 7
[b]tl;dr[/b] — When played by 3 or 4 RPG geeks inside 45 minutes (utilizing all "Faster Play" Rules) this is an absolute lark as a storytelling/party game; with the wrong number of the wrong people with the wrong mindset in the wrong timeframe it's absolute hell.

[size=10][BGCOLOR=#FFCC66][COLOR=#663300][b]O[/b][/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size][COLOR=#663300]nce upon a time, when I was 13, we played [i]D&D[/i] all night long at a slumber party.  Around midnight we killed the whiniest kid's character, took all his magic stuff, drew a pentagram on his chest with Hershey's Chocolate Syrup (in the handy squeeze bottle) and threw him into the swimming pool.  [i]Munchkin[/i] is exactly like that.  ~[/COLOR]

[size=12][b][i]Munchkin[/i] is a party game.[/b][/size]

[i]Whether it's fun or not depends entirely on the group.[/i]  

It's a stupid-fun activity, not a strategy game where players capable of 4D chess will prevail.  Dumb luck and above-the-table whining have far more to do with who wins than skill or intellect.*  Yes, the jokes are lowbrow and get old.**  The standard rules can make the game overstay its welcome by a factor of 10.  But with the right group and right mindset this is good fun inside of 45 minutes.  Just add beer, pretzels and a sailor's vocabulary.

[size=7]*Not entirely true.  There is a [i]teeensy bit[/i] of strategy in building a hand and tableau that can threaten a sudden win from Level 6 if you know what you're doing...

**The intended audience—RPG nerds & the con crowd—actually appreciate the repetition.[/size]

[size=12][b]It's fun as long as it's fun.[/b][/size]

[i]Kill it when it turns.[/i]

[i]Munchkin[/i]'s fatal flaw is game length.  It kicks ass for about 30 minutes, and then everybody starts to get antsy, looking for the end that never seems to come—a cool, refreshing wave that rises up and curls white with feathery tips of sweet release... only to recede again as someone thwarts someone else's lunge for Level 10.  Over.  And over.  [i]And over[/i]...  Until someone finally sneaks an exhausted win and the game is unceremoniously forearm-wiped back into the box and hurled into the closet to cries of "Why did you make us play that?" and "Never again—no, I [i]really mean it[/i] this time."

[COLOR=#CC0033][b]SUDDEN ASIDE:[/b]  [i]A Note to Designers.[/i]  Every game is only good for so long—find out where that is and then design your game to come to a satisfying conclusion juuust under that threshhold.  This will make people cry "Let's do that again!", shuffle up and go—instead of "Thank God [i]that's[/i] over," shuffle off and [i]go[/i].  Think of it as analogous to the physical limitations of masturbation and you're on the right track.[/COLOR]

So, can [i]Munchkin[/i] reach a satisfying climax before chafing sets in?  It can, but most of the time it doesn't.  Hideous time dilation lurks deep in its DNA—everything possible must be done to prevent its expression.

Here's what we do:

[b]1.  Play with 3 or 4 players [i]only[/i].[/b]
With 5 it's a grind; 6 is miserable.  Keep it short and sweet with fewer players.

[b]2.  Use the most current version of the rules.[/b]
Four Doors & four Treasures as the starting hand (and when returning from death).

[b]3.  Use ALL "Faster Play" Rules.[/b]
Add [i]Phase 0—Listen At The Door[/i]; [i]Loot The Room[/i] for a Treasure instead of a Door; win is shared with helper, regardless of helper's level.

[b]4.  Start at Level 2 (or 3!).[/b]
Why not?  Munchkin, &c.

[b]5.  Time limit/call it the moment it blows.[/b]
We usually play to 30 minutes, maybe 45 if it's a particularly good session.  But the moment anyone is not enjoying themselves and would rather do anything else, we call it after one more round (The [gameid=3837] Rule).  If no one hits Level 10 by then the winner is determined by highest total combat bonus from cards in play, with level as a tiebreaker.

[i]Munchkin[/i] is not a strategy game.  It will not work for those who must clench a bolus of control in their anal-retentive sphincters.  

It's a social interaction coupling device.  

It's a party game.  

In that regard it does a decent job and gets anywhere from a 5 on up to a 10, depending on the group dynamic.

It's best when played inside 45 minutes by 3 or 4 goofy, old-school fantasy RPGers.

[B]MEGAMUNCHKIN[/B] — [COLOR=#FF0000]*COMPLETE*[/COLOR]

It turns out I already own [i]four other[/i] fantasy [i]Munchkin[/i] sets—which makes me either stupid, rich or duped.  I think I'll go with "hopelessly funtropic" & "shame-impaired" instead.

So why yet another?  Well, the original is enjoying its hard-won retirement as a shelf toad, the second is "pure sepia" from the era before full-color cards, the third is specifically frosted for Christmas holiday play, and the fourth is in the camping bin where it gets begripped by the filthy hands of wild children.  This one, though, was conceived via the hideous congress of my anal retentive tendencies and my irrational love for the game—[-]I wanted a set that could absorb and utilize all the various small expansions that SJG poots out with maddening regularity[/-].

Excellent card game.  My 13 yr old loves playing and back stabbing.  Now, if only she would learn to wait until after the 3rd round to do so, maybe she'd have some allies and a chance at winning.  The wife does not like it that much but she will play if pressed.  I can take it or leave it.  It's really fun with large groups who are comfortable attacking and being turned on.   I can see the main flaw, as stated by others, is that it could become very difficult to win when playing with experienced folks.  This is when the game becomes quite a bit more strategic and holding onto the right cards becomes key to winning.

Munchkin is a mediocre game that some people seem to love based ONLY on the pasted RPG in-jokes and D&D powergaming nostalgia. I don't hate the game by itself: I hate the game because of those guys that insist on playing and replaying it and buying all expansions and forcing others to play a bland game that gets burned after 2 plays, is very repetitive, is complex without being deep and drags forever.

Try Cutthroat Caverns: it is superior in all aspects with a similar theme.

I dont know why this one is that hyped. Okay, the theme is fun and it just feels right dumping the others once in the game. But except for that, almost everytime the second player who is trying to reach level 10 wins since all the steam was already used on the first player trying to win. In addition, there are huge downtimes and you often spend your turns doing literally nothing.

It's fun to play - but the winner is just determined by pure luck. You only win if you get a monster and if the others don't have enough cards against you anymore at THAT moment ... or you are a priest and the right card pops up - I love being a (Munchkin-) priest ;-)

If you like the style of humor Munchkin uses, it's fun to read through the cards - I find about half of the cards to be pretty funny.  However, I don't particularly enjoy the game.  It's too random, for one thing.  You can't acquire levels and loot until you're lucky enough to run into a monster you can actually beat, which makes the early turns frustrating.  I find that the game falls apart completely if you have 5 or more players, since there are so many people to gang up on you when you get close to victory.  I think with some tweaks to the rules it could be made into a much better game, rather than just a set of joke cards masquerading as a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The classic CardPG of dungeon crawling, looting, and backstabbery.  Still a great game after many years, though I'm way behind on expansions.  I try to put this on the table more often than my group will let me, but I still hold onto hope.

Would give it a ten if it wasn't for the fact that you need at least 3 players. 2+ player games are better suited to me as I only know one other boardgamer who will play this stuff with me. I love the art, and I am jealous of those who have collected multiple sets and built sweet chests to hold their collection. I also love that this game does not take itself or its genre seriously :)

There was a time when I played munchkin a lot. Then I somehow became aware of its flaws and it didn't anymore interest me as much as before. I wouldn't say it's as bad of a game as many players I know bash it to be, it's a pretty good filler-ish game, but unfortunately it can go on for ages, which, again, is not nice for a completely random filler game.

An old classic! This game brought me into the world of board games, so I remember it fondly. The game starts off slow and everyone is more than willing to help each other defeat monsters until someone reaches Level 6. As that person climbs up the levels to Level 9, other players pull out as many cards as possible to beef up monsters and reduce the highest level player's combat strength. This unfortunately prolongs the game because it's only a matter of time before everyone else joins them at Level 9. At that point, if people haven't already used up all their offense cards, the game is pretty much determined by what card each player draws when they kick open the door, each desiring a low-level monster, which would be easy to defeat and difficult for everyone else to beef up, or a filler card that allows them to play a low-level monster from their hand. By the time someone draws/plays a low level monster, players must decide--should I continue to fight for victory or end this 3-hour period of torture? And of course, everyone chooses the former.

This is probably one of the first board games I've ever bought as a child. It was fun but as time went on it lost it's shine. The thing that makes me hate this game now is that it takes all the fun of adventuring and role-playing that you are promised in DnD and makes it insufferable. A game that starts out kind of fun becomes terribly agitating as people attempt to kill the leader over and over again. To make matters worse, the game seems to only serve to prolong it's play time until finally one person decides they've had enough and just lets someone win. If I had to make a list of all the games I'd recommend I'd learn new games just so I could push Munchkin farther down.

Funny theme, nice player interaction - would give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the unholy price, when you don't even get everything you need to play (dice, chips), packed in a way too large box, with rules that leave you guessing as to the effects of certain cards. Considering that you get Wiz-War for the same price, which I think is a far better game...

First English edition, 4th Printing, Feb 2014

From publisher's web site:

What makes this edition "deluxe"? It's got a big gameboard to keep your cards in place, and six colored pawns that you move on the gameboard as you level up! Plus a card to go with each pawn, to make it easy to remember who is what color and whose sex has changed!

An often hilarious game, especially in groups. Games could last from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on how often characters die and/or lose equipment.

Enjoyed it for a decade, but it has been collecting dust for 2 years now. Game isn't as fun with just two and jokes/fun-art get stale after so many years.

An amusing game of equipment collecting as you make your way through a simplified dungeon.  Later on in the game players will become so powerful that no monster can slow them.  It's at this stage that the interference of other players becomes vital, however their interference is never enough for a well stocked player.  The backstabbing nature of the game can cause arguments.

Ideal Players: 5-8

Description: Kick down doors to find monsters, curses, and treasure. Be the first to level 10 to win in this D&D parody game.

Pro: Funny art. Quick and easy gameplay. Evokes the spirit of old-school D&D--killing things and taking their stuff. Success or failure not determined by dice. Promotes beat-on-the-leader mentality.

Con: Lacking in choices and complexity. Gets old after a few plays (although the expansions help with that). Monsters tend to be overpowered or underpowered. The game would be better if encounters scaled with levels (getting cooler classes, treasure, etc. as you get higher level).

What can I say about munchkin which wasn't already said? Most people either love it or hate it, though it's beyond me how can you hate a game that's got a Resident Weavil (you can't resist the evil of the weavil), or the Duck of Doom (you should have known better). Either way, it's a light game that still might bring to an end a fare share of friendships (depending on how firecly you play). I Found it to be very kind to starting or non-gamers, and they can pick it up and enjoy it relatively easily. It gets messy with all the expansions, and might make the game drag on a bit. All in all, a good bang for his buck!

New in shrink wrap. We bought a mystery treasure box of loot and for some reason they thought that we'd want the base game... 

Would love to trade this game; because it's still in shrink wrap it would be a great present for a child or gamer who has yet to experience Munchkin!

Fair assumption that we have every expansion and booster pack, every bookmark and Tabletop Day, every play mat and artist edition of tis game ever bade...

I played this one only once with my wife and friend. None of them really understood the game (maybe I explained it wrong), so I did not get a proper experience out of it (this no rating so far). I liked the Tabletop episode where Steve Jackson himself played it with Will Wheaton and other guests. Looks like a funny, quirky and light take on RPGs or deckbuilders such as MTG. Will try to bring it our and experience the full power of Munchkin,

One of those games people love to hate.  It is essentially a sillier and less streamlined version of Cosmic Encounter.  Lots of negotiation and bluffing to be the first to ten.  They never did add enough extra content in most expansions but I still like the game, a bit.

I will never willingly play Munchkin ever again. Once was enough to foster eternal hatred. 

However, it does sort of work. It's not really much of a game, and it's not really entertaining, and it's more of a way to see how much you can get your friends to hate hanging out with you and whoever else is playing for an hour or two without totally snapping...but it works in doing all that.

I'm sure there are worse games out there, but I have yet to have the misfortune of encountering them.

This game was really fun when I first got it but now it seems to be getting a little boring. Mostly seems to be luck and the fun seems to come from the inside D&D jokes on the cards. Once you've heard them all, not much left that's fun.

A game with both good and bad qualities.  The good, it's a funny and social game you can play with friends over a few drinks or at the end of the evening.  The bad, is trying to end the game with a lot of players where everyone is screwing each other out of the win.  That makes it feel like a game that cannot end, and this game really should be finished within an hour  max.

You know what you're getting into the second you start reading the rulebook. If you're looking for a game that requires deep strategy, this isn't it. But if you want something you can get a group of friends to play and have a raucous time, there are few things that can match Munchkin.

OK, I can see why some are turned on and some off by this game.  Turn on's: Humor, especially among old RPGers, and the ability to screw-your-neighbor.  Turn off's:  The occasional arguments over rules as some of the cards tend to conflict with one another.  We actually like this game as a filler and enjoy the lighthearted feel to it.

An OK card game that simulates dungeon crawling with a lot of slapstick and funny jokes that appeals to D&D and MMO players. But the gameplay itself is pure luckfest.

Munchkin has some cards that are funny to read the first time. Beyond that, there is little to recommend here. The game is almost entirely determined by luck of the draw and the whims of the players. It drags on way too long as players who are about to win constantly have their progress taken away from them.

The popularity of this game shows there is a market for games featuring lots of randomness and take that mechanics. Some find this enjoyable - I loathe such games and, as a result, actively avoid playing Munchkin.

I can't stand looking across the table at someone with twenty cards... and having no idea what they mean collectively.  (I guess you just have to play until you *know* the cards completely.)  Also, you have the UNO-like "don't let that player go out" type phenomenon.

Ok game I guess.  Steve Jackson wins the award for cheapest game production ever.  Supply your own components! Here, a deck and a box.  Not even an insert!  Holy cheap-ness.  If you can get past that, you will probably like the game.  Very tongue in cheek.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Any game where you start off weak and must face a progression of increasingly difficult tasks in order to grow stronger and eventually win must have a mechanism to assure that you face the trials in a reasonable order.  Munchkin fails miserably at this.  See Formidable Foes for an example of this done correctly.

At least Munchkin has neat John Kovalic art, and the roleplaying jokes are funny the first couple of times through the deck.

Ah, the fun. Munchkin is a lovely game if you do not have time for an serious rpg. You need to have some knowledge of Dungeon &amp; Dragons, or at least Lord of the Rings to fully understand the humour, but the rest will do just fine. Lots of &quot;one card killers&quot; and places where rule arguments may occur, but in all, a really fun game. Should not be played without the expansion. I also reccomend the Munckin D20 books if you like this D&amp;D parody.

This game was fun for about about 5 minutes until the humor factor wore out.  Once the humor is gone, the gameplay is just boring.  There are much better RPG inspired games than this.

Also there is too much "screw the leader".  Sure, everyone wants to slam on the winner to stop them, but Muchkin takes it to a new extreme.  The only way to win is to grind through everyone's hoser cards, and hope they finally run out when it's your time to attempt winning.

Only have played once, but it was pretty fun. The rules have a little bit of a learning curve, but it isn't too bad and I'd imagine would be easier if we all weren't intoxicated and trying to make sense of it. I particularly like it because it feels like "RP-lite", so it doesn't turn off your super socially-aware girlfriend but also gives you a little bit of that tabletop feeling. I plan to buy it myself at some point.

My gaming group seems to really like this one, but for whatever reason, it just really hasn't been enjoyable to me.  I'm not sure whether it's because Take That games aren't a favorite genre for me, or that the game is extremely lightweight and often mindless, or that it just is one of those games that seem to bring out the worst in people, but I simply don't have a good time playing it.  Obviously many people do, so it's likely just taste and not game quality, but I really do think this game is a take it or leave it kind of game.  I rate it a 3.5/10 because I'll still play it when it gets brought to the table, but I can't say I'd ever actively choose to play this game myself.  I recommend playing it once or twice before buying- you may love it, but you also may be extremely disappointed in it.

All theme, no play.  Which is a pity because it's such a fun theme.

This card game is a classic DnD RPG parody. I'll pull it out occasionally with a group of fantasy RPG gamers. Anyone else just isn't going to connect with the theme. Even with the expansion packs, the game lacks replay value. It's funny the first few times and then quickly gets old. The game is exceptionally luck based. Still...when played in moderation, it's a fun game. If you're looking for a serious game, this is NOT for you.

This card game is a classic DnD RPG parody.  I'll pull it out occasionally with a group of fantasy RPG gamers.  Anyone else just isn't going to connect with the theme.  Even with the expansion packs, the game lacks replay value.  It's funny the first few times and then quickly gets old.  The game is exceptionally luck based.  Still...when played in moderation, it's a fun game.  If you're looking for a serious game, this is NOT for you.

RATING: 6
I think the fun of this game depends a lot of the people you play it with.  But then again, if these folks are that much fun, wouldn't you have fun playing or doing a variety of things that evening? Ok, that's a bit unfair. The game encourages lightheartedness with its humor and does encourage interactivity, even some negotiation (when you're trying to recruit people to help you defeat strong monsters).

A good game with the right mix (and not everyone will like this game).  However, I think it just stretches out a bit too much.  There's *too* many mechanics that seem to work to prolong the game, by propping up the trailing players by passing discards their way, to the massive 'attack the leader' effect.

Plays a little long if the cards come out poorly.  Still a good card game to play and, judging from the additional stand-alones and expansions, a lot of others feel the same way.  It's fun the first time through the deck, just to read through the cards... after that it gets a bit boring, but it's always great fun.

I don't like this game... at all... calling it a game is insulting to me actually. My wife loves playing... which I do not understand. We still own the pirate version, but I won't put it in my collection, because I don't want the world to know.

It is 100% a take-that game, where the majority of the game is luck. Not too fun in my book. I play on occasions so that people will play fun games with me.

2012-12-31 - This game is a lot of fun, ignore anyone who tells you otherwise. The theme and humor of the cards are nice, but where this game really excels is in the backstabbing, screwing over your friends. Whenever we play, it doesn't matter at all who wins, but who you kept from winning.

Bash the door. Slay the monster. Steal the loot. Under anyone else, this could have been a simple dungeon crawl game using cards instead of books and dice -- but not for Steve Jackson. Jackson's loads it with humour (Level 1 Potted Plant!) coupled with John Kovalic's art (Coat Of Arms is literally a coat with extra arms) give it that extra oomph to turn it into a light and enjoyable party game that moves so fast it demands all players remain involved.

BIG PLUS: easy to learn, sense of humour
PLUS: all ages
MINUS: you can get bored with it after a while

All the fun of a Fantasy RPG without the role-playing.  Of course, role-playing is the primary point of RPGs.  On the other hand, I do think this game is a fun diversion to quickly kill monsters, gather loot, and build a character, all with fun pokes at RPG and Fantasy culture.

Works best with 3 or 4, but even those games can run really long.  Add more players and people quickly lose interest when it isn't their turn and then each turn becomes a process at trying to figure out what everyone else has equipped now or had done on their turn that you missed.  If you like backstabbing and reinforcement type affects that alter an outcome, do it right and play Cosmic Encounter.  Chances are you get done with that game a lot quicker as well.

RATING: 3
Munchkin is a lighthearted, very simplified sort of game that takes its cues from the Role Playing genre. There is no actual role-playing here, just a decent concept for introducing casual gamers to the realm of Role Play tropes while managing to get a chuckle from experienced Role players once in a blue moon. 
If you're looking for a deep tactical and/or strategic gaming experience, look elsewhere. If, however, you're interested in a game where anyone can win and no one is out of contention at any point during the course of a game, then go ahead and pick it up... better yet; I'll trade it to you. 

Don't get me wrong, I do give it props for being so simple. Also, Munchkin is nothing if not cheap and endlessly expandable -- and it can provide a few laughs if you happen to find that style of humor favorable. Keep in mind that even if you do, the humor wears off after a short while, so you must expand at some point, lest the game become stale in this way. 

I gave Munchkin a 4 mostly because I would have expected to play this game more than I have after owning it for so long, but it never leaves its dust-covered little box on the bookshelf because something else always seems more appealing to me. The Role playing theme should be right up my alley... it should be funnier to me... yet, for whatever reason, it just isn't.

I recognize that the series is insanely popular and quite well-known. Chances are, even your most casual board gaming friends will have played it or at least heard of it, which means they might just be interested enough to sit down and play it, while you begin to sell them on the games in your collection that you wish they WOULD try, because you know they'd just love it if they gave it a chance. 
Munchkin is what I'll affectionately coin a "background game" from here on out, so named for its ability to progress without much concentration required from its participants insofar as any significant decision making, because, ultimately, things can take a quick turn for the better or the worse regardless of how well you have played thus far. It' indecently random, which, for me, doesn't make it an enjoyable experience... ever, win or lose. Lastly, I was really annoyed that it doesn't include some sort of a character level counter in box... instead it asks you to "find" things in your house that you have lying around... use your smartphone, etc... Really??? Come on. I know it's trying to be cheap, but wow.

original game drags on waaay too long. Thus, I made it first to level 7 wins, that speeds up the game a bit, plus that everyone starts with a random race and class card, to get them going. also removed a lot of the more text-heavy cards, and complex rules, and replaced with low level monsters to make this game a fast filler, not a several hour slug.

Too long for what it is. Played 2 games last night.  First one lasted 1 hour - 15 minutes too long.  Next one lasted 1hr 45mins.  Hasn't really grabbed me. Game encourages backstabbing and ganging-up and theoretically our games club is supposed to like that.  But when it happens no-one appreciates it.  Humour is genuinely funny esp. if you've played RPG's before but 'funny' doesn't make a good game.  Overall, pretty lame really.

Nope.

I think it's funny...the cards are hilarious. But the game mechanics don't always work very well. Can be a bit slow (or long) and sometimes feel like you are stuck or helpless.

This game is HIGHLY OVERRATED! It was fun the first couple of times but the mechanic of screw your fellow players gets old really quick! If someone is winning be ready to go down significantly in points as this game should be called "screw the winning player." I went from liking this game to thinking it was ok to wishing I had never played it!

RATING: 4
It's fun the first time you play it and goof around.  The second time you see the cards you haven't.  The third time you're wondering why it takes so long to play such a simple game.  The fourth time you wonder why you're playing at all...

Most folks that love Munchkin aren't regular gamers. Too luck based and too easy to get screwed over. Fun to play if you're in that mood, but usually I want something deeper than that.

I keep a copy of this just in case I have Steve Jackson Games-playing friends over, which is far too often, in my opinion.  Maybe I should I really get rid of this and just force them to play games that I think are fun.

As a D&D parody, it's moderately funny.  Most of my friends are active roleplayers of one stripe or another, so at least there one benefit to playing this game, as it often segues into us talking about previous rpg campaigns we enjoyed, or future games we are excited about.

I've played once and it was right after Monty Python Fluxx which felt superior to this. Kovalic's art somehow doesn't function here at all and unlike for many others the cards didn't generate much laughter when seen for the first time. I can't understand why this is such a popular game.

Love this game, I've played it with my wife, my neighbor with his son, and my little brother and sister, and every time we would all have the best of times together. Like Dungeons and Dragons having been simplified and with its DM, modules, and books turned into new card decks. Each expansion deck can be mixed with each the base decks allowing for new gameplay each time. And the base game itself makes for a great gift for young and old.

Light take-that game, with some good RPG humour on the cards. When trowing in too many expansions it gets bloated though and its take-that nature can draw it out to the point when it overstays its welcome. But in the right mood with the right people I wouldn't mind playing it.

RATING: 5
Incredibly over-rated, this semi-party game is best played with people you haven't played it with before, and preferably non-gamers entirely. The fun of this game lies entirely in reading the cards and the attendant silliness. And it was fun the first two or three times I played, when I would have rated it about a 7 for fun factor and humour.

But the mechanics are dumb, the game usually ends up in beating on the leader until everyone hits level 9, when the winner is determined by who happens to pick up a weak monster to kill, or when everyone else ran out of "take that" cards. Occasionally a game is determined earlier by even more stupefying luck in one players favour.

Do not play with less than five players.

I give this a 5/10 for initial fun factor games, and still being able to have a decent-ish game with non-gamer friends. But you can do better!

A blatant send up of roleplaying games, with a comic twist. I've got too many of the expansions to list here, but since all of the cards are mixed together it doesn't really matter anymore which ones I have. Although I made a point of buying 'Fairy Dust' because it was pink and 'Munchkinomicon' because adding another deck is always fun.

I want to like this game so much; I like the humor, the screw-your-neighbor factor, and all the different themes. But it's just too random, and games can drag on way longer than they should. What always ends up happening is that we just give up and and don't stop someone from getting to level 10.

- Games drags on for too long with 4-6 player.

Love It or Hate It - Munchkin is one of those games that must be played with the right group and the right frame of mind.
Play this game with strangers or serious-types and it wont be fun at all - it is too random for that.
However, play it with your family or gaming group (especially if you are a roleplaying group) and it will an absolute blast - mix in a few drinks and them everyone can start to enjoy the awesome combinations of equipment, races, classes, trap cards and monsters and really get into the theme. 
Sure there is the randomness, but if the players realise that its not who wins that is important but the fun that is had during the game, then everyone will be a winner

RATING: 7
The original screw-over-your-friends game.  You are a human with no class, unless you play a class or a race. You equip some item and you bang down some dungeon doors in search of loot. More often than not you will encounter a monster, that monster however is much much stronger than your puny sling of +1. What is an explorer to do? Ask for help from those around you maybe they'll help, in exchange for some of the booty. Or maybe (probably more likely) someone else would like to see you fail and play a card that will help the monster. This game has about a trillion different ways for either of those two situations to happen and the expansions just add to the goofiness. Dead simple to learn game, setup is less than 5 minutes. Strongly recommend buying the deluxe version as it comes with figurines (which are just for cosmetics, they are fun though) and comes with a board that is used to count level. Casual game, could even be played at parties with some varied rules (level up to 7 or 8 instead of 10). Lots of people hating on this game but in its own right it is still a lot of fun.

At frist you laugh about the images, later you start to laugh about some fun tactics and insder jokes of you playing group. Thus I disagree that it gets old very fast.

RATING: 3
This game does exactly what you think it should... and little more. It is fun and silly and makes fun of power-gaming RPG players.  It's drawback is that it is a very light game that only appeals to hard-core gamers (who get all the inside jokes). My wife learned to play easily, but didn't get half the references or think that most of it was funny, for instance. It's kind of like a Will Ferrell movie - if you don't go in expecting fine cinema, you'll have a great time!

I'm a fan of Munchkin. I've spent numerous nights staying up til the wee hours of the morning giggling away with my sister or friends over lengthy silly titles like "I'm a super munchkin dwarf elf wizard with a really impressive title, a big rock, a pointy hat of power, and boots of butt kicking. I'm fighting a level two perfectly ordinary bunny rabbit that if I don't defeat it, I am dead, even if it was just an ordinary bunny." 

Not all games should be taken seriously. This one is all about the humor, interaction and light hearted, get in tune with your silly side, fun.

RATING: 6
While I am not a Munchkin diehard, purchasing every game variant and expansion, I am also not a Munchkin hater.  I enjoy the game for what it is but recognize that this is not a true war or boardgame. There is strategy to a degree but this, more than most other games I own, is just silly, nonsensical, and random, with reasonable plays being crushed by bad card draws and suboptimal play rewarded by drawing a level one monster towards the end of the game, really screwing things up. 
I primarily play with power gamers, which seem like an odd fit for this game. Our Munchkin games typically follow a pretty cautious pattern with a few players catching good luck and charging into the lead, a larger gaggle hanging in the middle, and a player or two that cannot catch a break and languish far behind. Eventually, one of the front runners makes a charge for level 10 and all hell breaks loose. The first player knocking on level 10's doorstep seldom wins, and at that point it is anyone's game. While the second player to make a run has an advantage, even the lone straggler player can win as "screw you" cards are played against those assailing the game's victory condition. 
This may seem pointless and stupid and perhaps it is but I play the game infrequently enough that it has not grown old or stale and the cards still make me laugh. I can see where repeated playings in a short period would detract from enjoyment of this game but that has not happened to me as of yet. It may not be a war/board game but for what it is, it is pretty darn funny.

I played my first game of it with just my husband, but it was still fun! Three to six players is totally a better group to have for this quick card game. It should be fun for RPGers AND non-RPGers alike!

RATING: 7
This game is fun. It is basically pure luck and understanding of the use of the cards, but it is so funny to screw your opponent , especially when he doesn't expect it.
Very recommended for youth from 11 to 16.
The game becomes better after 5 or 6 gameplays, when you know how to use the cards. The first 5 gameplays can be a bit difficult, but once you know the cards and how to play them, this game is absolutely good ( especially with the expansion " The need for speed".
There are more tactics and strategy in the game than you would expect, but you will learn these only after enough gameplays ( 5 or 6 at least).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
On its own, this is, without expansions, it's a fun light card game, which can be a great introduction to the hobby for tabletop RPG gamers. Parodies a lot of RPG tropes, so it can be a blast to play if in the right mood. This is, in the mood of playing a humorous take-that luck fest.

Thankfully, while novelty wears off, if players are familiar with the rules, 3 or 4 player games last 50 minutes tops. Can end sooner, but once you reach the 40 minute mark, one player is almost guaranteed to snowball out of control, thus ending the game. It's like the game had a timer built inside its mechanisms.

Expansion, while have their fair share of funny cards, break the "balance". This is, it's no longer so certain someone will snowball out of control past the 40 minute mark, making the game drag. And more than an hour of Munchkin can be extremely boring.

RATING: 8
An enjoyable card game for fans of D&D and associated jokes. The mechanics aren't too difficult, and the gameplay is fun with the politicking and backstabbing that goes on. Our only complaint is that older versions of the cards are trickier to separate into the two decks due to the backs having very similar color schemes to each other. This seems to have been fixed in later printings (along with the tongue-in-cheek reference to cheating in the rules).

Munchkin might be a decent gateway game for people used to roleplaying, due to it poking fun at all kinds of nerdy stuff. When the hilarity of the cards wears off munchkin reveals it self as an uninteresting game of flip a card and react. On top of this it is painfully long due to the terrible take that mechanic and will only end after all players have expended all their cards preventing people from winning and someone flips a level 3 monster.

Even though this game is a lot of fun during your first 10 plays, you will soon find out that the more you play it, the more the game drags on.

You spend 30 min at level 1, then the game speeds up to level 8 in 1h, and then you spend another 30 min stuck at level 8 or 9. Whoever plays when others do not attack cards anymore win.

That game is a 8 for the first games, but I just hate it now and can't bear to give it more than 4.

Seriously, this game will bring out the absolute worst in everyone you know. It's endearing at first, but after you've wasted hours on a game where the dickhole thief is just constantly stealing from and backstabbing everyone (and staying permanently at level one) to ensure that no one else can ever win the game you will never. play it. again.

That's not the only hideously un-fun thing that can happen, but it is easily the worst.

As with any Munchkin game, you should metaphorically stab each other in the back to get the full experience. The name of the game is "Munchkin" after all ... if no one's going to be Munchkinly, what's the point? There isn't much of a game when everyone is constantly nice to each other. Stick with co-op games if you're averse to harmless and lighthearted contention. Anyway, it's all just good, clean, dirty fun.

The classic dungeon romp in the form of a tongue-in-cheek card game. Once you proselytize your friends in simple terms what a generic D20 RPG is and why Munchkin is a parody of it it'll be good for many a solid (and especially funny!) session.

A fairly good game that is more about the journey rather than winning. Don't get me wrong, winning at this game is great but that's not the only point. I find the cards to be humorous and playing with a fun group adds considerable value to the experience.

I used to like it, but I've lost interest in the game.
It takes too long of doing roughly the same.


If you're the guy that's always picked on in games, (Because you own the game or know how to play it or something like that) you can't win with more than 3 players.

In my opinion it is fun for teenagers and people stuck in that mental age group. (No offence)

Played once, 5 players.  About as good as I expected; a total waste of time.  I can really see how this game would appeal to "experience game" fans; those that prefer a fast paced social game, with lots of opportunities for jokes.  Strategy gamers (like me) will hate it, since there is essentially no strategy and no way to plan.

Nice idea, terrible implementation. Too much flaws to be forgiven: lasts too long for what it is, absolutely luck driven, existance of some cards so strong that can ruin an entire sesion... The artwork is funny, and the theme is really appealing, but Munchkin totaly fails at providing players with an enjoyable playing experience. True, with the right people and at the right moment, you can have some fun playing it, but it is true for almost any game, isn't it?

One of the first non-Hasbro games I ever played. Played this a ton one summer and got totally burned out. That was about 5 years ago (at the time of writing this) and I haven't played it since.

Highly random game that is is just FAR too long for what it is.  This could be a cute filler but if you play to block the leader from winning, it cna easily take two hours.  Even though the cards are cute and mildly funny, they can't sustain interest for that long.

Great game for a large number of people.  While the rules may limit the number of players, there is nothing that prevents more people from playing (other than it taking more time).  Can become painful if you are playing with others and they team up and "meta-game".

Cards themselves are very funny but you need to get the nerd/RPG humor to really enjoy the game.

Sometimes you just don't want to be kind to your friends... remember that time when your good fella crushed you at "In The Year of the Dragon"??? Well, munchkin will make things even and restore the friendship and love! :P

This is a fun game, you betray and back-stab (and sometimes help) your pals and, if you don't take it personal (which you never should!!!), is pure fun and awesomeness!!!

There's not a big lot of strategy here, and luck is the queen, but then, it's so much fun!!!

This is a very silly "take that!" kind of card game. Very little skill involved and a lot of luck but can be quite enjoyable with the right group. A problem with this game is that the game can drag on and on because of unlucky card draws and people just being downright mean. Usually all players gang up on the player who is winning and makes there life miserable! Also, I am a big rule-follower and the rulebook states that if there is a rule discrepancy to hash it out amongst the players...my worst fear! A little too silly for me most of the time.

Silly, somewhat cutthroat fun.  Can be a high learning curve, and some people are turned off by the complex calculations of levels, items, and various "screw you"/"help you" cards that can all go into a particular monster fight.

My updated review:
This one's taken a hard fall... We used to play it quite a bit, but I don't want to play it anymore. For me, it's too lucky, and you get punished for being the first player to get close to victory. Plus the game can get really lengthy for what it offers...


My initial review (originally gave it an eight):
Munchkin is the best game if you like to start arguments! The rules are always contradicting themselves, there's a lot of interpretation needed, and that's where the arguments start.
Anyway, a very funny game with great artworks and a lot of stupid cards! (A big geek culture is needed to get the jokes...)
The negative part is that it can take a long time to play, especially when you have the expansions. We had some very long games, up to 8 hours long... Where everyone finally gets bored and very tired.
.... But playing with the expansions adds lots of fun stuff, I can't play without them!

Yes, it's a beat up on the leader game, and yes, if you make the mistake (as we did) of playing ALL the decks together, without Munchkin Blender, your game will never end. But, even beyond the jokes (which are all funny the first time), there's at least a marginal game here, which really can generate some enjoyment.

This game was funny for me to read, the way it made fun of the typical dungeons and dragons romp.  Repeat play is a little more tedious.  Our preteen and teen players play this often as it has both a "build your guy up" element and a good friendly backstabbing as a required element.  They often make up house rules to make the game more exciting, and the sarcastic nature of many of the cards plays right in.

Very fun game, especially if you're into RPG's. The cards are printed in duo-tone which makes it difficult to distinguish between treasure and dungeon cards (and that's only important when discarding [separate decks/discard piles] but it would have been nice to have a different colour on the card faces). 

On the flip side, it just takes too damn long to play for the "fun value".

Played this one with my nephews and it was a good game although I don't think I got higher than level 2!! My nephews loved it - especially the older one (age 11). Humour was good, artwork was good (although would have been nice if it was in colour). Had to keep referring to the rules but it was only the second time they'd played it (my first time). I would play it again and will probably have a go at some of the expansions.

Fun and somewhat original at first, it quickly becomes repetitive and loses its interest. Could probably be a good pick to entertain a group waiting for other players to arrive at a gaming night. Could also be considered at Xmas party with cousins/family members... The rules are 'intentionally' vague as to let players argue like he*l like real RPG Munchkin types usually do. Yeah, it's cheap in every sense... Tons of expansions will probably be printed but dont expect anything different than a fully chaotic,  humorous 'kill me-kill you' type of game.

Our second game was fun but three of us used most of our cards to stop someone from winning & the next turn, my turn I had an easy monster & no one had anything left to make it harder. I default-won the game. This apparently is a common thing. Still fun to play every once in a while.

Played my first game. It was interesting but I wish I had more cards in my hand during the game. Two people ran away with the game & someone kept getting cursed & loosing equipment. Ended up with two "Add a monster' cards and no monsters to add. Funny little game thought.

Munchkin has it's rare moments, but it's just not a good game. The rules are poorly defined, the game is inexplicably long, and the randomness frequently punishes those who are behind more than it impedes those who are ahead. It also has the worst excuse for a catch-up mechanic I've ever seen in a game.

Once you've seen someone win a game by defeating a potted plant for the last level, you've seen it all. Play Cosmic Encounter instead, there's more variety, the rulebook is actually more coherent, and it's a better mix of silly randomness and take that elements.

If you ever played D&D this game is a real scream.  If not, you probably won't get the jokes.  The best part of this game, is that once it ends, jumping in to a new game is really easy.  Luck has a large influence on this game, but it doesn't really matter, as the whole process is light and breezy.  Super consistent theme too.  It is all about D&D (or the associated Ninja/Cthulhu/Vampire/Star Trek themes.)

We brought this over to the extended family's place for Thanksgiving and it *caught fire*. Our non-gamer friends and relatives loved it, played it over and over, and asked if they could borrow it when it was time for us to leave. In the right group (one whose members have a passing knowledge of D&D but who lack the experience of more in-depth games, and who are high energy and relatively competitive), it can be lots of fun. My opinion of this game went up after Thanksgiving weekend. For me, though, it's still too luck-based and its replayability is limited.

The success/enjoyment of Munchkin, in my opinion, is entirely dependent on the group playing it.  You need a group willing to back-stab without taking personal offense (excluding short-term grudges, of course), and really get into the spirit of the game.  Without these qualities, Munchkin is mediocre at best.  With the right group, this can and has been the funnest game I've ever played.

It also helps to have the appropriate "flavor."  Not as fun if you're not into the theme

Eventually decided it wasn't getting enough love anymore, and passed it on to a household that would actually play it.

The game is supposed to be a joke, right?  Like, you're not actually trying to create a fantasy adventure experience; you're supposed to be [i]mocking[/i] the fantasy adventure experience.  Yet I've seen people go deep and serious about this game.  I can't comprehend.

The game takes way too long.  It's way too random, with way too much down time, and way too little payoff in the time-to-fun conversion.  I respect how there are so many varied expansions/sequels covering basically every possible RPG theme which are all compatible and can be mixed together... but it's just not fun.

Basically, one of the couple games that got me into it all. It is fun the first time you see each card, but gets considerably less fun each time you play due to the draw-a-card, play-a-card mechanism. This seems par for the course with Steve Jackson games.

card-based game, but very little text or complexity

heavy screw-your-neighbor mechanics, especially for someone who gets ahead early
can bog down late as people dog-pile on those in the lead
luck largely based on card draws, both for monsters and treasures
pretty high interaction, including open-ended bargaining for help or item trades


Similar games in my collection: This game is somewhat unique as a light, mildly competitive card-based game. Chez Geek is similar, that I do not own. Smash Up, sort of.

A fun game for a while, then you realize it's just a "screw the next guy" game, that really, can go on and on if you want it to. My kids like it, because of the screwability, and it's simplicity, but to me, it just gets annoying after a while. The expansions didn't help this.

It might be a good game, if you had too much time on your hands and too much alcohol at hand.
But even then the rules are just bad and gameplay gets tedious.

I don't drink (enough) and my gaming time is rather precious => 3. I like the theme, the artwork and the jokes though. It's just the game that's flawed.

I used to love this game a lot more before too many expansions and too much game-breaking merch turned every game into a 2-hour argument over the wording of rules. Still have a soft spot in my heart for it, though, and will play it in its bare-bones format on occasion.

RATING: 6
Played twice. It's not really my type of game.
The humour wears off really quickly and the gameplay is heavily luck-depended. The theme is not that strong, and the game feel repetitive after 30 min. Everyone simply draw cards, play some cards, try to screw over the top player; once that person is no longer the top player, everyone simply gang up on the next top player. Somehow, a 3-player game can drag on for more than 2.5 hours.

Un jeu particulièrement fun, assez tactique, où le premier joueur se fait régulièrement taper sur la tronche (ce qui équilibre les parties). L'ambiance très parodique est bien soutenue par des dessins tordants. En revanche, les parties peuvent vraiment s'éterniser et c'est le gros point noir.

Mid lenght game with a humorous touch. Simple, fun, humourous. Expansions add more and more content to the game which doesn&#039;t get repetitive. Play with at least 3 people, 4 being optimal. The only con is that some rules and sequence of events can be confusing.

In this card game, every player is against every other player. Make no mistake, it will become nasty.
The goal of the game is to reach level 10 before the others, but the focus is how you deal with them. You can resort to any means in order to obtain what you want: pleading, trading, deceiving, threatening...
You can intervene in fights to hinder your opponent, or to help him (in exchange of something). Or you can do both.
Discussions are inevitable. Dirty tricks even more so.
The only flaw is a certain randomness of the game system.
Try it, but only with friends which are capable of taking the worst with a laugh and a joke.

As with munchkin quest. poor. sad disappointed. I could have given up on games at this point altogether based on this.

"This was one of the games I got on my first foray into this rediscovered hobby following Nuclear war. This choice was based on blind recommendations and my first experience of how bad those recommendations could be. From the reviews this sounded great - ok there were some dissenters but maybe they were wrong. There are always dissenters even on good games. They weren't wrong. I got this at the same time as the munchkin quest and I really should not have bothered. Dull lifeless lame jokes far too much effort for what was a joke anyway. Clearly the 'joke' was supposed to be on things like Descent but since that is awesome it falls flat."


Played this again with 3 a year later and although its not as bad as I remembered it was still disappointing.

I think the thing was that I was expecting awesome and I got meh.

This game can take forever to get moving. It requires a miracle for someone to get powerful enough to make real headway because the only real strategy available is to bash whoever happened to luck into the lead at the current time. Once someone manages to luck through all the bashing there's not much you can do about it but wait for the next hour or so to end.

It smacks of haphazardness with differing terminology for the same thing i.e. one monster card says +5 against Dwarves but another monster says Elves are at -4. A nit pick but still not encouraging.

It's a real shame Steve Jackson is content to shoot out dozens of iterations of the Munchkin dreck instead of producing games of the quality SJ Games used to offer.

While I respect Kovalic's talent as an artist I just don't enjoy his style.

Great for drinking game, but that's about it.  Goes on too long, humor gets stale after the first couple of plays, and is a beat-on-the-leader through and through.

I really liked this game once upon a time. Then I played real games and ended up realizing that Munchkin's victory state is utterly random and hugely subject to kingmaking. Moreover, it's not a great couples game if one of the couples you're playing against refuse to engage in the dickery that this game tries to encourage. Ultimately, the only way to win Munchkin is not to play it at all.

I am so sick of this game and even more sick of seeing a new incarnation appear, which happens way too regularly these days. We played the original (with an expansion or two) for hours on end while waiting out hurricane Isobel. It was hilarious... we laughed and laughed. Good times. We've played a number of times since then and I'd rather live through another hurricane, listening to the siding peel off the house (one nail at a time) for thrity-six hours than play another game of Munchkin.

Pretty much a game that only gets pulled out when there are people around who haven't seen the jokes before, and when we're willing to just walk away when we get bored. Not actually interesting or fun enough to just play as something that is sufficiently fun for the gameplay.

It's possible that it becomes a better game with expansions, but I don't have any of them myself.

At first everyone had a blast because we laughed a lot about the cards (names, descriptions, pictures). But thats where it ended. After nearly one hour of play and everyone but one player (who was level 2) still (or again) being level 1 we decided to stop and play something else. This will probably never hit the table again.
Can't recommend this one for the game. If you just want to read the cards this is a great one, but if you want to play look somewhere else.

I dont like munchkin as much as some of hte other SJ card games like Chez Geek. It is fun but you really need to play with people who played D&D or better tried to play as a kid. It can be funny but I dont find the game that much fun.

Funny cards but poor artwork.
A lot of text to read on the card that slow down the game.

Objectively, it's a type of game I would like:
+ fantasy-themed; going on an adventure
+ turn-based
+ collecting things, having weapons, armor, magical items, accessories
+ kinda like an RPG; having gear, leveling up

But when I play it, I get competitive, and I get mad when people target me, and I can't target them back. Like when Chynna targeted me, and I wasn't allowed to target her back. As a side note, I'm pretty sure when people target me (in a non-friendly way), then I get upset. I didn't like that Ryan keeps winning; it kinda seems inevitable that he'll win, and it doesn't make it fun. I guess I don't like it when people team-up.

I like the game in theory, but it just always ends up dragging on way too long. The last half of the game is just everyone stopping one another from winning, until someone finally gets lucky as others have run out of ways to stop them. I feel like Cutthroat Caverns provides the same fun of screwing one another over, without extending the length of the game.

UPDATE: Ignore the previous review. It's been many years. This is just a bad game, period.

I have only played the 2 player game and felt it kind of weak. After many turns nothing was happening and we were wondering what we did wrong.

Ahh Munhkin. In all honesty its a fun silly little game. But I would also say it is one in which you couldn't play it very often without it getting a bit stale.

Fun with the right people and mindset for sure.

Munchkin is a great "fun" game. It's light hearted.  It's humorous.  It makes people willing to just let go and enjoy themselves.  That is, of course, with the right group.  Some people just refuse to give in and enjoy themselves, quoting whatever "too cool" reason they have.  But ignore them, find someone more open minded and play a fun "caRdPG" game!

RATING: N/A
I have the deluxe board version and have the Axe expansion. I am still seeking the most appropriate group to play with as I accept the warnings from previous reviewers regarding how receptive they will be to the nature of the game. 
On reading the reviews it appears that the most common criticism relates to the length of the game and in particular the " Dog-Piling" on the level 9 player by the group which usually thwarts his/ her ambitions and clears the way for an unoposed win by the next player in line as additional monster cards are depleted etc. 
I feel ill equipped to give any suggestions that may serve to overcome this problem as I still haven't played the game. However, the time issue could surely be addressed by perhaps imposing certain " House Rules" such as; players begin on level 2 -3 ( At least a  go down a level card could be used ) Now with particular reference to the assaults by the group on the level 9 player; perhaps if these interventions had to be qualified by a Dice throw the prospective winner has half a chance ( or more ) of succeeding. An example could be that I have 2-3 cards that will spoil the level 9 player's hopes but have to throw the Die once and beat the counter throw. Should I lose then I cannot introduce any card, play then passes to the next challenger etc. Should there be 5-6 players a rule could prohibit more than 3 challengers ( first come first served basis ) 
Although I haven't played yet and may love or hate the game when that time comes; I get the general impression from Mr Jackson that he would not  object to any improvisation that could or would improve our enjoyment of the game. After all Fun is just the thing to have!!
I hope this helps folks.

I'm sorry, but it just doesn't work for me.  I loved it the first two times I played it.  Now I detest it.  Once the jokes stopped being new, I realized that I find the gameplay rather lacking.

A large variety of cards, a decent amount of strategy along with a bit of luck, Munchkin is a lot of fun to play. Few complaints, like the very heavy reading and math nearly every turn and I have gotten into many arguments over vagueness on cards.

RATING: 6
This game will always have a place in my heart as we discovered it during Superstorm Sandy where it provided countless hours of ‘light’ entertainment, (pun intended). Ever since the electricity came back on I started being over it. I definitely believe it is worth to play a few rounds and chuckle at the RPG/Geek Culture references, but in a lot of ways it feels a lot more like reading a funny comic with friends than playing a game. That is fine, but there are only so many times you can reread the same pages and still enjoy yourself. Of course that is the reason why there are countless expansions to keep things fresh. After trying quite a few of the expansions the pattern became clear and it took increasingly less plays to grow tired of the new cards.

For my tastes the mechanics are filled with too much randomness and positive feedback. Too often someone quickly turns into an ever more powerful Übermunchkin while everyone else is just hoping that the Duck of Doom will provide them with better hands early in the next game. Good filler as long as it’s new to you, grows old fast.

A funny game at beginning, too shallow few plays after. Requires therefore a constant stream of new cards, what may not be seen as a really constant game value.

Too long, too random. Great fun with the right group of people. If you have some hardcore roleplayers, this game can be a catalyst for great storytelling and reminiscing about your old D&D campaigns, at which point the game no longer matters.

RATING: 3
Man, I used to love Munchkin. My group played it incessantly for a couple of months, and then gradually lost interest in it. For me, that came down to a combination of too much randomness and a very poor time:fun ratio -- it's too long to count as filler, and not satisfying enough to stand in for a deeper game.

Kovalic's art and the overall flavor are the best thing about Munchkin, and the only thing that would bring me back to it at this point. There just isn't enough else there that I enjoy.

Played it again, many years later, and it's still awful.

Oh my good, this game just missed the board and card game revolution of the last 15 years. It is dull and end game is pure kingmaker mechanism.

RATING: 5
Not as much fun if taken seriously. 

Box insert: I give it a 1/10 because I don't think I could grade anything lower than that unless the game didn't come with a box and had 100 pieces. They put two tiny decks of cards into a box that is far too big and there is no sign of any card board to stop them from moving. They could easily sell it in a box like quao or love letter so it could be a pocket game, but I guess they were too eager for shelf space.

It's trendy to hate Munchkin, I know. I'm not surprised. But at the same time Cosmic Encounter gets praised. Now I love Cosmic Encounter and it deserves all the praise. It's a permanent top5 game for me. But really BGG? Munchkin is basically gateway version of CE, let's be honest. That's how Steve Jackson made it. Why hate it for that? I prefer Star Munchkin version since I love sci-fi. Mechanically classic set is pretty much the same. I keep this set around since it's localized to my native language unlike scifi one. Most of  the jokes are funny in childish way. I prefer to play with 45min timer.

An entertaining game, but it takes a bit of time to teach, and the game itself, while extremely funny, is limited in it's scope, and therefore, its re-playability.

Less time to think adds to the randomness and hilarity of the game.

Cutthroat game of dungeon crawling and backstabbing. Munchkin is a good 'warm up' for a night of gaming but not good for much else. There is a random amusing chaotic element to the game that is good for setting a mood to the evening but makes wider strategizing difficult at best. Many games end with a player ascending to ninth level, his opponents exhausting all of their offenses against him, and the next player to go for the win getting it as his opponents are out of ammunition to use against him.

The cards are funny the first couple times you play it, especially when you understand the references (like The Gazebo). Other than that, it's a very poorly designed game that relies solely on the luck of the draw. Plus games can drag on forever. If this were a 20 minutes game with a mechanism to prevent it from going much further, it could be decent, but as is, I don't think anyone would genuinely enjoy playing it after the second or third time if other options are available.

Gets old really fast, and just lousy if one plays with people who don't play RPGs who won't get the inside jokes.

The game can be extremely punishing, as everyone will gang up on the leader, and this can go on for quite some time.

Other than that, this game is skill-free.  You will either get the cards you need, or you won't, and it will be painfully obvious when you do, and just as painfully obvious when you don't.  There is no tension beyond this.

Munchkin is cute and funny for about 10 minutes.  After that, exfoliating with a cheese grater is more enticing than continuing to play this mess. 

One my least favorite games.

Pretty simple game making it a perfect choice for introducing new gamers to the hobby.

I played this a lot in various groups of various different backgrounds. It was well received by pretty much everyone. 

Bad: 
The game has really simplistic gameplay that becomes extremely repetitive after a while. 

The endgame turns into a lot of take that to beat down the leader and king making. 

This is one of the games that is great when you are first introduced to the boardgame hobby, then when you see what is out there you don't really want to this again.

The original backstabbing card game that everyone can enjoy/rage at! The artwork is amazing and some of the illustrations and puns will have everyone laughing. It's not for everyone though as the 'take that' style of gameplay can annoy some players.

Playing becomes a chore after the novelty of the puns wears off. Cards are pretty poor quality for the price, too.

RATING: 6
Immature, cutthroat, and cliche... but FUN and with TONS of player interaction. Players take on the roles of cartoonized fantasy fighters all competing to be the first to kill/buy/bribe/backstab their way to level 10. Lots of "dude, sweet" and "no you didn't" moments. This one is often overlooked, but when it hits the table, everyone enjoys it.

RATING: 6
This gets points for being really cute, with great cartoony artwork combined with funny card names.  The game is pretty interesting, but gets a bid ridiculous sometimes.  It pushes out all the depth of Dungeons and Dragons, leaving just the exploration excitement, and then turning into a war of words and making monsters really big, or screwing up your opponents in one way or another.  I'd rather play something less cut-throat, with more depth.  However, it is pretty amusing.

Fantastic fun, best played at the end of the evening once the slights, attacks and niggles of earlier games have created some suitable friendly rivalries around the able - a wonderful opportunity to take revenge on the so-and-so that stole your city in Carcassonne / cut your road in half in Catan / generally messed you up in another game.

Great ingame  backstabbing gameplay but the real world conflict created by vague rules creates too much real world backstabbing.

Update- I used to play this constantly at work but it really does have a lot of vague rules. In the end the game is about being nasty to each other so arguing over rules is probably in character for the game but it just isn't fun. I refuse to play games with poorly written rules any more.

Won at a convention, have not played yet, but I hear it is cool.  Update:  Finally played someone else's copy (I sold mine).  I was a newbie and there were about 7-8 other players (experienced) so I didn't find the game very enjoyable.  Maybe if I tried it again with a smaller group and had a chance to get familiar with the cards I'd like it more.

Everything about this game is a blast and incredibly fun up until it's simply not anymore.

It has a great sense of style and humor with mechanics and gameplay that is immediately accessible if you're familiar with RPGs and quick to learn even if you're not.

You can have several dead draws which can hinder the early game quite a bit and bring it to a halt (though most of those cards have a "Get out of jail free" clause for low-level players), but it still is disappointing that it happens so regularly.

The end game, is where all of the fun quickly vanishes, as the "Screw your buddies" aspect of the game means that rounds become massive dogpiles of keeping everybody else from winning until somebody finally gets a lucky draw that can't be stopped or players have exhausted their cards to do so.

Even with that being the point of the game, it creates a lot of game sessions where feel-bad moments rule the day and most players leave the game feeling less than happy due to bad beats, bad luck, and/or a feeling of lack of agency.

Munchkin is the Steve Jackson definition of a joke.

The cards are fun to read.  The gameplay is too long.  As a house rule, we play maximum one hour or 45 minutes with a timer and after that time, the leader wins, no questions asked.  That way, the game gets some air, else it's a no go.  Star Munchkin gets more love because of the more nerdy theme.

This game gets a TON of hate for being what it is; a simple dungeon-crawler esque game meant for those who aren't too into either roleplaying or tabletop games overall! My experience with it: I like the game, though I do feel it is a little bit of a niche game. There is a take-that! element to the game, which is fine in general, but can get old after a while, and that seems to be this game's main flaw! While reviews and critiques can influence your decision, whether or not you should get this game is up to you to decide!

This was the first game that I bought when I was getting into the hobby. I had heard a lot of people talking about this game and thought it would be a good place to start given its simple rules and inexpensive price. At the time I enjoyed it. However, there is very little strategy involved here and the backstabbing aspect of the game is not enough to make me want to pull this game out. Carcassone and Ticket To Ride have really taken the place of this game for me.

Le mécanisme de jeu de Munchkin se veut volontairement une traduction la plus fidèle possible d'une exploration de donjon basique. C'est un "casse-donjon"... sans le donjon. Le matériel de jeu est simple : une pile de cartes Donjon, une autre Trésor. Au début du jeu, chaque joueur tire 2 cartes Donjon et 2 Trésor, et créer son personnage niveau 1(en posant devant lui les éventuels cartes Race, Classe, Objet Magique et Pouvoirs en tout genre). Ensuite on commence.

A social game not-so-social.

Is fun to play with friends but has two main drawbacks: Some players can get angry or frustrated if someone goes against them. Also you can spend alot of time waiting for other players to finish their turn.

So, it's only fun if you play against your friends and try to mess in their turns.

Also, you will need some expansions to not get bored early.

I really don't enjoy the typical character-building battle games, especially when your opponents can team up against you and virtually eliminate you from the game.  There isn't much fun to be had with Munchkin, since it really offers nothing unique or exciting about its gameplay.  By the end, you typically have way too many cards to even be able to figure out what your battle strength is, which greatly takes away from the overall enjoyment.  The theme is silly and provides a little additional entertainment, but I'm always bored by the end of this game.

As I've played more games (or even just reading more about games) I've soured on this. Reading the arguments against it just put words to thoughts I've had while playing. It's too long, there is too little agency and more.

It's my fear that Cosmic Encounter goes the same way with experience (it has already revealed some of the same tendencies), but it's more fun, gives you more to work with, and just on the whole a lot better - "strictly better" to steal a commmon term from MTG.

Just don't, play Cosmic instead if it is this type of game you are after.

Game in a Nutshell:  A light-hearted, dungeon crawl-ish card game where you fight monsters to be the first to level up to 10.

Played as:  4,5 player

Pros:  Has a good sense of humor all the way around. There’s some pretty funny items (slimy armor), monsters (Snails on Speed), and cartoon-y artwork (leather armor represented as a corset).  

Cons:  My biggest pet peeve here is downtime. Seemingly every card has necessary rules exception text on them (some much more than others) with no easy way to quickly separate that from the flavor text when you want to get to the point and keep things moving. It just feels like a big chunk of the game is sitting there watching other people read cards silently and figure out what they are.  If I could be contemplating a masterful strategic move in the meantime, I would be ok with that, which brings me to my second con... No real meaningful decisions. The biggest decision you need to make is if you want to be a jerk and drag the game on, or play nice and let it progress to an end. Outside that, it’s a lot of luck which can be absolutely brutal. 

Other:  I think I’m probably being hard on the game. It really should be more about the experience rather than a competitive event. What could really drag the game down are people who take it with one ounce of seriousness either by being butt-sore when crap is dealt to them or by refusing to cooperate to the benefit of all people. Again, this is less of a game than an experience. That said, the number of players I played with was too many for me. I guessing 3 players would fit best to minimize downtime, but still have enough people to make what little interaction there is interesting.   

Best Use:  The kind of game you’d bring out when you’re exhausted and have some time to fill without needing to be ultra-competetive.

El Munchkin es un juego "especial". Como la mayoría de los juegos de Steve Jackson. Y es que esta casa es capaz de sacar los juegos más originales y de temática más divertida "entre colegas" pero como casi siempre, falla en el sistema. El juego podría estar bien si no basara tanto su base de juego en la aletoriedad de las cartas, y hacer efectos tan descompensados, capaz de hacer que un jugador disfrute como un poseso mientras otro no pueda hacer nada excepto ver pasar los turnos. Un juego que viene bien para echarse unas buenas risas en momentos punteros de la partida (que por otra parte pueden ser gratificantemente divertidos). Pero nada más. El juego base "Munchkin" no está del todo mal. Quizá fue error mío el haberlo mezclado con las otras 3 expansiones que, al incluir más diversidad de cartas nuevas le daba demasiada vuelta de tuerca para principiantes.
"Chez Geek", también de Steve Jackson, posee un sistema de juego muy similar a éste, pero está ambientado en pisos de alquiler compartidos por frikis (al tener muchas menos cartas, se hace más rápido)
El "Fuzztoons", es la peor aberración que ha publico Edge y trata de imitar estremadamente mal y con sumo mal gusto al juego en cuestión: "Munchkin".

This game is one of the very few games that started as a game I loved when I first got it that turned into a game I ended up despising as time went along... The constant take that and one-upmanship and being ganged up on detracted from what appeared to be a simple "kick-down-the-door" dungeon crawl type of game with a humorous bent, and while the game's look is still great after all these years and the humor on the cards is still there... I just can't stand this game.

This was the second tabletop game I started playing after I was converted to the cult of "serious" boardgames. I loved it then: lots of fun, backstabbing interaction. Then I played it more and grew to hate it. Its cards aren't well-balanced, and there's much, much more chance than strategy. Now I'm cursed (those of you who know the game will get this), because my child wants to play this all the time.

Too much complicated for novice players and too much random for expert gamers. The core of the game is tricking the other players to attack someone else instead of you; I don't dislike it but for what the game can offer it should have been more streamlined (rules easier and clearer) and the required playing time should have been shorter.

Several non-gamer friends and I have played this repeatedly. Though the mechanics seem slim, it is (surprisingly) highly interactive, and a tremendous amount of fun to play. Many plays, lots of good times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
random card game, mechanics aren't great but fun still.  It always comes down to a final round where 1 person decides to try and win. This of course is always thwarted by the other players, however at some point 2-4 turns later the group runs out of "screw over" cards and the lucky person in this spot wins.

Весёлая игра для компании, с которой многие начинали. Предназначена в основном на ролевиков и D&Dшников (коих посредством этой игры понемногу перетягивают в настольщики), но благодаря большой популярности стала известна и среди простых смертных. Графика на картах выше всяких похвал - лучшего юмористического арта я пока не встречал. Юмор тоже в изобилии. А вот механика подкачала - за кажущейся простотой скрывается ужасный монстр из заплаток и подпорок. Если правила расписать по-честному, то они займут страниц 20. Для игры для новичков это должно было быть смертным приговором, но вот как-то не стало. Я уверен, что правильно в эту игру играет не более 10% игроков. Ну, т.е. правильно в неё играют только фанаты, которые регулярно посещают форумы SJG, общаются с волонтёрами SJG и участвуют в турнирах по Манчкину. У меня таких знакомых нет, а все известные мне лично люди, игравшие в Манчкина, играли в него неправильно (т.е. от "совсем-совсем не правильно" до "в целом правильно, но есть несколько серьёзных ошибок").

Меня в какой-то момент достало продираться в мешанине сложносплетений игровой логики манчкина и я в него больше не играю. А все 7 сетов и несколько дополнительных карт я рассматриваю исключительно как произведение искусства.

When I first started playing Munchkin, I loved it. The inside jokes and clever plays on common D&D vocabulary had me rolling. While fun, the game can sometimes become interminably long, going on and on and on. And they always end the very same way: The front runner makes a play to win, everyone else blows their load to prevent it, and then the next player in line takes it without any real opposition. And there's no way to really prevent that mechanic from playing out. And is probably why most games take as long as they do: Everyone is fighting to NOT be the first to attempt a win.

Artwork and concept is great and with 4 players out can be great fun. However, it is impossible with 2, less enjoyable with 3 and too long with 5 or more.

It can also last a long time with the player at level 9 constantly getting destroyed...

RATING: 7
Nice game. Very funny if you have ever played d&d, silly if you haven't.
Does have a bit of a problem with rules lawyers, but that is half the fun.
I knocked off a point because of the very poor production - the cards are poorly made and their color is drab.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As a long time, old school D&D player I felt right at home here. This game took the essence of D&D and turned into a comedic fun house. It's satirical nature towards everything RPG-esque made this quite a reminiscent, delightful treat. I particularly loved Munchkin's take on the real life player interaction that unfolds during a real D&D campaign. It brought back old, fond memories. 

The mechanics were also pretty easy to adapt to a wider audience, and in addition I felt did a commendable job at keeping the player interaction on par with how an RPG should be. 

I've heard so many bad reviews on this game in the past from fellow board gamers but am glad I went with my gut and took a chance on this whimsical fantasy.

Munchkin is a typical munchkin game: a blast with the right people, but not really because of the gameplay, only because of the fun situations that arise. With time however the jokes on the cards become known and its time for a new munchkin game. Applies to every munchkin game^^

Very fun indeed, fast paced game. Not the best to put in the table if someone in your group is an angry gamer XD But that is about it, as far as cons for this game. Love the flavor, all the jokes related to D&D and all RPG in general.

Admittedly, I have not experienced the game with more than a smattering out of the multitude of expansions, but I think I get the gist. Its not my cup of tea, which, in this category, is Libertalia. 

 It is a very simple game that is paradoxically riddled with rule ambiguity (even Steve Jackson- the designer- screwed up the rules on Tabletop).

 If you or your group are way into *TAKE THAT!* style games, however, I would assert that you will probably enjoy this tea quite a bit, as the game seems to boil *TAKE THAT!* down to its bare essence.

 Edit: 
After more plays and expansions- its a good beer+pretzels game.

RATING: 2
I hate to jump on the bandwagon here, and I have quite a history with Steve Jackson, but this is an awful game. It's barely a game at all. It's a pile-on, attack the leader, stall the end game. Any enjoyment, if found, comes from the cleverness of the cards and is unrepeatable. If you can't resist the humor, flip through the cards and satisfy yourself, but sitting down to a game of it is worse than unnecessary.

Ну Манчкин и Африке Манчкин. За смешными рисунками и ироничными текстами на картах лежит вполне неплохая игра с богатыми возможностями комбинирования и огромным потенциалом для общения, торговли и веселья. Я подсадил весь свой отдел на эту игру и во время обеденного перерыва практически каждый день мы "мочим монстров и меняем шмотки" - жалко только что в полчаса игра никак не влазит..И в час иногда тоже не влазит, а бывает что и за 1,5 часа не заканчивается.

Superb game. Usually play with 4. Used to introduce novices to card/board games. The silliness allows for competitive play with a light atmosphere. Usually enjoy co-op games, but the lightness and humor keeps this game fun even when it gets quasi-cutthroat at level 9. Only play with regular rules, and have not tried the "faster play" rules. Recommend the expansions -- have played with 2 & 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a unique game with it's ambiguous rules towards things like cheating and using random items you may or may not have to influence game play. This works for and against it in my humble opinion. It's really fun with the right group of people, but sometimes you get a few players that really abuse it and sap the enjoyment out of it for the others. Watch out for that and it's definitely worth playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game was frustrating at first.  The rules were confusing and seemed rather incomplete to even understand the basic mechanics of gameplay. We found some video recording on line of the creator just playing the game and after watching that for about 10 minutes, things got much easier.  Its really a great satire of so many of the ultra complex RPGs that just focuses on the good bits. Now that we have the rules figured out (we are probably making a few up and ignoring others, but who cares? We're having fun.) this game is in the regular rotation.  One of my favorite parts is that regardless of who gets the early lead, there is a pretty reliable pattern of behavior that the rest of the group gangs up on that person.  This leads to everyone really being right at the finish line at the end. It could be anyone's game just about every time.

I abhor this game. It never ends. It isn't fun. It isn't clever. It isn't thoughtful.

This is the board game totem for people who saw The Force Awakens in theaters and couldn't contain themselves - they screamed, with a religiosity of great potency, that "IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!! *IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!!!!!!*" over and over again.

Do. Not. Want.

Very humorous. Plays up to lots of players pretty easily. Unfortunately, that's the only good things about this game.  Drags on waaaaay too long, mostly because of broken mechanics.  In all the games I've played, the winner has been the person who happened to not run out of cards while everybody was busy destroying each other in the end-game.  Very frustrating experiences.  I honestly have about five times as much fun (in about five times less time) simply reading the cards than I do actually playing the game.

I have no idea why this game got so much hype in its time. The art and tongue and cheek stuff is really well done, but at the end of the day, you have a pretty thin game here. The only use for this thing is as a gateway game. If you are trying to suck friends into the cult, and you don't have Pandemic, don't have Ticket to Ride ok fine, whip this thing out. Otherwise,unless cutesy jokey stuff is enough to float your boat the tenth time you read the card, pass on this.

I've really soured on Munchkin since losing my early enthusiasm.  The rules and gameplay are too chaotic, and the humor doesn't work for me anymore.  I would rather play just about anything than Munchkin, and I should really try to sell it.

RATING: 3
I'm not wholeheartedly against Munchkin. I just find that all of my games (with a crew of 5 or 6) always play out the same way; people ignore others leveling from 1 thru at least 5 and then they may be enticed to obstruct a leveler from 6 onward. Most of the time this builds to a situation in which 60-80% of the group achieve level 9 and are praying for luck to draw a weak monster card and steal the win. Usually it takes a few go-arounds amping up the challenging monsters to hold back a winner. After a few rounds, everyone is essentially out of enhancers and potions and the winner squeaks by on a weak monster who gains little help from an exhausted war party. It's not awful by any means, I just find it unexciting and slightly routine.

The much-maligned Munchkin makes it to the table as a filler game, but does not benefit from repeated plays in a short space of time.

It's a game that can quickly become repetitive, but is nonetheless entertaining enough for a minor diversion once in a while.

A game mostly entertaining for its artwork and clever cards, the replay value starts to wane as soon as the jokes get old. A lot of the progress here depends on the die rolls, and games can go one quite long as everyone tends to gang up on the leader.

Great memories with this one. Perhaps the game that most pushed me into playing boardgames. My friends and I started playing this during our first series of "games nights" and we have always loved the hilarious flavor and mechanics. We play like bastards, and for me that has always been the best way to enjoy the game. Not to make the gameplay too strategic or personal.

This game is fun, what originally won me over was how open it is.  I love that you can soup up a monster enough to kill another player, and then offer to help them kill it for all the treasure.  Sadly you don't die often enough, and after a few dozen plays I just don't look forward to it anymore.

Probably too many rules for what it is. Enjoyable, but gets repetitive. Pretty much every game follows the same pattern - frontrunner comes close to winning, everyone spends all their cards to prevent it, next-closest breezes to victory.  Its length and arbitrariness keeps it from being rated higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the gameplay, artwork, humour and take-that nature of Munchkin -- but only for about 20 to 30 minutes.  It seems to be that the average game approaches or goes over an hour and at that play length, it really isn't worth it!

Fairly difficult, but not as difficult as doing an entire regular roleplaying session I guess... It would have been easier if some of the cards were the same, then you wouldn't have to learn such a big number of cards. There are many rules, which brings up lots of situations where it's unclear what the rules would say.

No game stating "all rule disputes should be solved by loud arguments among players, with the game owner having the last word" in its RULEBOOK can be good.
This is pure mess, leaving so many subtle dependent rules on the players that I wonder why they bothered to have a rulebook in the first place.
That's not what game design should look like.

Other than that, loooong and boring random bunch of events with runaway scoring and bash-the-leader, where the only fun is from reading cards. Do yourself a favor, don't ever buy this, go to a teahouse, lend Munchkin, spend a few minutes reading the cards having laughs and then go play an actual GAME.

EDIT: Yesterday I watched it played again. Isn't that just annoying how players can decide to screw your cards and combos in YOUR turn, in the time when the control should be yours? I just wish the BGG evaluation could go below 0, to express what an abomination this is.

RATING: 6
I love this game for the shear goofy fun of it. The rules are quite simple, but the interaction of the cards make it a little difficult for younger kids. That is my only regret about the game--I won't be able to play it with my daughter for a few more year.  Still, one my favorites for pure entertainment.  Get a bunch of friends together and laughter will ensue.

I don't understand the loathing for this game by some in the community.  I guess some people don't like "fun", and it isn't serious enough because the strategy isn't deep enough?

This game is a bit crazy so it's enjoyable with some RPG aspect. The downside would be like most of time in this cases, the bash the leader thing.
The first that is at the doorstep of victory got bashed hards; given the victory to the next player. But really still fun especially after 2-3 beers.

I just don't love it.  The puns are cute and the monsters are kind of funny.  (The first time you see them.)  But it just takes too long and the jokes get old fast.  It isn't a horrible game and it can be fun with the right bunch, I just suspect it wasn't the kind of game that was made for me.  In the same way that I don't laugh at Dumb and Dumber.....just not funny to me.

It is okay.  But I would rather play almost anything else but some of my pre-teen nephews like it so I keep it around for them.  I am considering gifting it to them if the truth be told.

A classic dungeon crawl, comedy, group game, which has a cult-like following.  It has spawned several expansions and differently themed (same basic mechanics) additions and sequels on its way to several awards and a lot of money-making--who says the Wizards of the Coast has a corner on the card-set-expansion model?

RATING: 9
I've played many many times to this game. We where 5 each time. It was long but very cool parties!

My advise is to never be more than 5 and to not follow the rule when you ask player help (the rule tell to ask each player one time and the first who want to help you just do it).

Just let players fights and threats them self to know if they will help you or not ("I can help you and I win one treasure", "No I wont this guy win the treasure so I can help you and you win all treasure". "If you do this I will make you combat fail with something I have! Or not..."). The only point is that YOU choose who will help you...

This create very long party but it's so fun! It increase interaction between players a lot!

I've never played so much with extensions. I've buy one (extension 1), we've played few parties with it but rules on extensions was so long/boring/difficult to understand that it completely break the game.

For me, Munchkin is almost a party game. There is no complex rules that's why you will not play days and days to it. But for the time you do, it will became good remembrances.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It takes a little time to get used to the "play anything almost anytime you like" rules but the game does trigger a few good laughs that any fantasy BGGs will appreciate the first few times you play.

However, buying expansions to freshen up the cards is practically essential...except that if you add more then one expansion in it completely brakes the game!

A game doesn't need to be deep in order to keep me interested, but it does have to be fun. Munchkin is the opposite of fun. 

It takes way, way too long for a game that has very little interesting decisions to make. The winner can also swing wildly. I could tolerate that a bit more if the game lasted 10-15 minutes instead of 30+. I have actually refused to play this game on occasion.

Taking its lead from RPG's, this card game looks to take the mickey out of the genre. The first few plays are exciting and full of fun as each card is a new surprise. Once the freshness wears off though the laughs tend to disappear and in the end it tends to always outstay its welcome.

Pretty funny at first, but it's waaaaay too long for what it is, it's far too easy to get locked out by rubbish card draws (if someone gets bad draws for the first few turns then they don't stand a chance) and the whole game follows a very predictable path once you've played it a couple times.

PROS: 1. Fun (at first time). 2. Nasty, lot of interaction (but now I think that not so much)

CONS: 1. Random and chaotic. 2. Too long with wrong company (players, who like "thinking"). 2a. Some book-keeping slows down the game. 3. Twisted rules (and it's difficult to explain them to newbies). 4. The term "balance" is missing at all.

Best with 4 or 5 players. If fewer than 4, then it is difficult to downgrade the leader. With more than 5 it is too much downtime.

ISSUE: Fun at first time, but then -- boring.

-No interesting choices
-Lots of cards with their own individual effect makes for long downtime
-Winner is the first who doesn't get blocked anymore

This is not the worst game ever like many people would believe you. However, it definitely doesn't deserve all of it's variants and expansions either.

There are a lot of cards that hinder other people, but there's really no point in using them unless someone is about to win, at which point everyone spams these cards they've been keeping up until that point. Some of the cards are pretty funny, but that only lasts the first few games. For non-board gamers, there's probably too much reading.

Overall, if there's nothing better to do I would play it, but usually, there is...

This game has what I call the "Cards Against Humanity" effect. Your first few plays are really fun. The cards are hilarious, and the unique aspects of the game make it really fun to play - at first. After three or so plays, I knew most of the cards, and the game basically devolved into throwing tons of cards down only to have all the players gang up against you at level 8 or so and wipe you out. While it's hilarious at first, I prefer games where you have a sense of progression - building up your character as the game goes on makes you feel accomplished. I would much rather this game involve losing levels and some loot rather than staying at the same level and losing it all.

This has quickly become a regular play with my daughter and I. With two players it is a lot of fun but as with most games, the more players the more entertaining it becomes. Play is fast moving, rules are easy to understand and house rules are always an option (and many times encouraged)to add some spice to gameplay.

Have made it one of our travel games by using the 
phone app which includes level counter, dice and armor counter. Take the decks and wrap them with rubber bands and you are all set to play where you like for the most part.

This game seems as though it were designed to incite argument. The fact that the rules can be a bit ambiguous frustrates me somewhat. Also games seem to take a mysteriously long time and can require a lot of table space. Still, it’s the theme of an RPG wrapped up in a relatively simple card game, which I really like.

RATING: 7
My first non-mainstream, tabletop game purchase. When I first bought Munchkin, my gaming group (comprised mostly of non-gamers) played this every weekend for at least two months--we even crafted our own board. Eventually, however, the hilarity of the cards wears off and the gameplay gets a bit stale (we started waiting until about level 7 before screwing each other over), but it's not a bad game. (There's certainly much better ones out there.) It's been almost a year since I've played it last--maybe it's time to bring it back to the table (at least for one game).

RATING: 6
In this card game that spoofs Dungeons and Dragons, players draw cards out of deck, which could be a monster, curse, race, class or other special cards. Players have to fight a monster, and get rewarded a level if they defeat it and get treasure. Otherwise they have to ask for help or try to run away. This game works since it is easy to play, and the cards are funny. There is a ton of luck as well, so if you are looking for an evening of laughing, and not take game play too seriously, this is worth a try.

This 2001 game has spawned a number of sequels and expansions.

RATING: 2
A "take that" card game that lasts entirely too long for what it is--when opponents stop you from winning, it often sets back your progress and doesn't improve theirs.  Extraneous design elements such as race and class abilities that don't accomplish anything other than to make the game more swingy.  Extreme slippery slope and unsubtle politicking.  Compares unfavorably to Kill Doctor Lucky or 3012.

RATING: 1
The owner of the game store I frequent has expressed amazement that Munchkin continues to sell well at $24.95 MSRP when it's really just a deck of unlaminated cards and some rules.  After playing the game I am left with no choice but to assume that its fans are self-abuse experts with deep-rooted psychological problems that reinforce many of the negative stereotypes about gamers in general.  If you actually think that the trite and predictable in-jokes of "Dork Tower" and "Knights of the Dinner Table" are funny, and if you like games that have absolutely no balance and involve nothing but pure, blind luck and can easily last upwards of 90 minutes, then this mindless, overpriced, ill-conceived and barely-produced abomination should be right up your alley.

First off, the artwork is excellent.  And the in-jokes and puns can be pretty entertaining ... for the first few plays.    But that's about where the fun ends - at least after a handful of plays.

The game itself isn't well designed, with instructions that are vague and unclear in many parts.  I've owned this for a long time, have played it ~20 times, but it's just gathered dust for the last few years.

Best use is as a "filler" while waiting for the rest of your gaming group, to be set aside as soon as you have a quorum. But you probably have several better games you could play instead.

RATING: 10
The original!  This is one of our favorite games to play.  So far we've picked up every card expansion (still missing some promos and 'extras') and we love it!

Gameplay is fast and fun.  Players can team up for or against one another and often, in our games, the person who is currently in the lead will get ganged up on to prevent them from winning.

The only issue we've seen is that (like all card based games) it is possible - and usually happens to at least one player - to have really bad luck with draws. However, this is the case with a lot of games that rely on luck to get the resources you need to play.

Too easy to stop someone from winning. Games often took 3+ hours when played with gamers who played it straight, and games with others just went to whomever was most socially amiable. The game is 100% luck/social based, with minimal (if any) strategy.

The game also encourages players to cheat, and if you are playing with people who would do something like that, it gets very miserable very fast. I believe I also heard that there are tournament-legal bonuses you can get by buying other products by the publisher? That's just wrong on so many levels.

The only reason I still own this game is that I'm afraid if I throw it out, someone will pick it out of the dumpster and be cursed with it.

- Unbalanced, high level players just messes all up. "But I have this card here to screw you around!"

Update:  After more plays, I will never play Munchkin or its off shoots again.  It bores me solid.

Great theme, awful game. That avarages out to, well, avarage.
Makes fun of fantasy gaming in general, and D&D in particular. If you don't know anything about this, most of the jokes will be lost on you. And really, the jokes are what makes this game work.
Gameplay doesn't exist. You just draw a card and hope you can use it, most of the time you can't. Endgame consist of everyone attacking the leader, until people are out of cards so the current leader can steal the victory.

Eventually, the jokes start to get old, so:
Dropped the score: 6 --> 5.

Was a gaming café a while ago. Was asked to play a Munchking game (Zombies I think) and realized I really didn't want to do so. So: 5 --> 4.

RATING: 2.5
The biggest problem with Munchkin, outside of the base level of depth present in the game, is that the winner of the game is primarily the second person to make the attempt at getting to level 10. So when one person is fighting the final monster to win the game, generally people load up on their buff cards to make the monster win. That player dies, and all the buffs have been used so the next player is generally home free to win the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
One of my first games.  It can be a lot of fun when you are winning and downright awful when you are getting clobbered.  Luck plays an important role in the game but there is plenty of room for strategy.  My biggest complaint is the end game.  Essentially the person closest to winning can expect to have the kitchen sink thrown at them and it can be very frustrating.

Like so many other games that are supposed to be "fast and fun", this is a great game for the first 20 minutes. Unfortunately it easily takes 3 times this long even with only 3 players, and only gets much worse as you add warm bodies. 

After the first 40 minutes I find myself wishing that someone would just club me into unconsciousness to spare me the tedium. 
...and just when you think it's over, someone comes up with some silly card to stuff the lead player and keep the game going on and on and on. There are at least two of us in the group who will help someone else win just to end the damnable thing. 

Here's to hoping that this 'fad' will die out tomorrow...

RATING: 6.5
I love the humor in the cards for this game.  One of the elements I really enjoyed is how, as each player nears that magical level 10, the other players began to cooperate to thwart the current winner.  It leads to a very good, self balancing game.

UPDATE: I'm finding that Munchkin games are either really good or a total chore.  It all depends on finding the right group to play with.  If the players don't have a background in fantasy gaming or story telling, all of the humor falls flat.  It is even worse if the player doesn't have a history of video gaming, especially role playing games.  The concepts were totally foreign to my parents who struggled through half of a game before giving up in frustration.  My son is a big fan, but he really just wants to use the curse cards and cause pain to other players.  He'll use them even when it isn't strategically advantageous to him.  Once he runs out of opportunities to be the bad guy, he generally gets bored and loses interest.  On the other hand, I've played a few games with players with the appropriate background and only a moderate mean streak, and these games were a lot of fun.  Given this experience, I'm modifying my rating for the game from an 8 (based on the first game) to a 6.5.

An over-hyped, bland card game desperately trying to be funny. 

The only reason people have any fond memories of Munchkin is they all won their first game. First-timers always win. The veterans blow their cards combating each other, while they take it easy on the newbie who then sneaks in a victory while no one else has the cards to stop them.

Boring, plodding, and long, especially with the basic starting setup.

Happy I offloaded this game on Craigslist.

Ok, so here is the deal. I know this game gets a lot of slack on the geek and in other locations where board games are drooled over. Maybe it isn't the most refined game of all time, maybe it is a bit silly (well, yes in fact it is silly) and yes of course there is little strategy to be employed when everyone is back stabbing without reason.

But this is the game that took me straight in, it welcomed me to the world of collecting and the delights of artwork - particular thanks to [user=kovalic] for that. This was the game that I saw at a youth convention over someone's shoulder and the bug was caught. Maybe it is all nostalgia driven nonsense but I have great fun whenever we bust this game out.

We do implement a time limit though, the games do tend to drag on :P

Everyone loves it. It's a great game to get kids into board games because it's simple, funny, and new players can easily win because the game is like 75% luck. If you're a seasoned gamer then look elsewhere. This game is silly, not really an actual serious game. Take a look at Cosmic Encounter if you like the interaction and backstabbing of Munchkin with a bit more strategy and depth.

We finished playing Taj Mahal and said, "We need a little filler game to clear the palate before jumping into something meatier."  Someone suggested a six-player game of Munchkin.

Two and a half hours later, someone finally threw the game.

I don't mind a little bit of "take that!" in a game.  Hell, it's what FFG is all about, Charlie Brown.  But it's like cilantro, in that a little bit goes a very long way, and for some people it tastes like dishwashing soap.  If "take that!" is part of your game's balanced breakfast, excellent.  If it's the only mechanism in the game and you're depending upon it for ALL balance issues, we've got a MAJOR problem, and Axe Cop ain't gonna save you.

I can admire a game that's gone through 19 printings.  It's found a wide audience.  And to quote Carlin, I ain't in it.

My first play wasn't bad, I felt it was just a goofy game and found it rather amusing.  My second game was absolutely horrendous.  We had someone try to explain the rules off the top of her head, and she wasn't sure of most of them.  This wasn't that big of a deal, but what made the game horrendous was her screaming at all of us (the rest of the players) saying we weren't playing it right.  Taking Munchkin too seriously?  Really?

RATING: 5
A fun family game.  It's hard for me to rate because I know it's good, but I think people come to the same [or like] conclusion I have.  The game requires little skill or strategy and it's basically cards with stats on them and the person with the best stats and are the most agressive/focused win.  People who just like playing with the funny cards generally lose.  But hey, they win at having the most fun in my opinion.

It's not a game I bring to the table when I want everyone to have a blast and have a chance to really use their heads.

Munchkin is like Fluxx in terms of 'who cares, it's funny' games.  You get the same out of both.  Some theme, some laughs, and the winner is whatever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Amusing game, but painfully random, with no card balance.  Flip a card -- do you die, or gain a level?  Oh, you're about to win?  Do the other players have cards that can stop you, or don't they?  They don't?  You win!  Yay!  The only strategy seems to be convincing other players to blow their mailicious cards on other people so they don't have them when your turn comes around.  That cutthroat aspect is the only thing I do like about this game.

I sometimes play this one at conventions or events where I don't know people -- this is one of those games I never play with friends.

Yes, the cards are funny.  Once.  They'd better be, when you're paying 25 bucks for them (and nothing else).

A basic turn goes like this: "Open a door" (draw a door card face up for all to see). If there is a monster there, you try to beat it, if you can't, you try to run away. Beating the monster earns you a level and treasure(s). If there isn't a monster, you can either "go looking for trouble" (play a monster card from your hand) or simply "loot the room" (draw a door card into your hand).

When we first started playing this, I thought this was a cute little game. 
When after a while the first "Wait, a minute, how long is this supposed to take???" questions came up, I had my first doubts. 
And when finally someone won because everyone else just got tired of preventing it, just so that it would finally be over, I decided it's not. At least not for me. 

It's basically Phase 10 with jokes and you can actually loose previous phases again so that it takes even longer.

This is a wild and crazy game with a Pythonesque brand of humor.  It requires a back-stabbing spirit of doing unto your neighbor before he or she can do unto you.  Play is a bit bewildering for the uninitiated, who have as yet no knowledge of the multitude of cards available, and how they interact.  The monochromatic color scheme of the cards is certainly no help in this respect.  (2+3)

Not a game we pull off from the shelf a whole lot. A simple dungeon crawl, if you will, with cards. This game can be fun to play when in the right mood. But some games, due to luck of the card draw can cause any given player to not get a card to come up in the right order. I have played many games where I keep drawing equipment and never get to level up in a good fight...can be annoying.

I enjoy playing with the tiny Christmas expansions. It was fun to pull this one out a few days before Christmas and have a holiday dungeon crawl.

We absolutely love Munchkin.  The game is easy to get into, and my kids absolutely love playing.  The only downside (for me) is that it can be a longer game than it's weight would imply.

Gameplay is really easy - open a door, battle a monster (maybe) and collect some loot.  Oh, and watch out for backstabbing buddies who are more than happy to invite some more monsters to your little party and then more than happy to offer to help you...for a price.

Fun to play, great game with a ton of humor in it.

I really think 'Cock-Blocking' needs to be a separate game category on BGG.  You know, for the kind of game where a major focus is to screw the other players over.  That's the case here... and it's pretty fun.

Its a pretty simple game that even non-gamers seem to enjoy.  They say it can be played with 2-6 players but I'd recommend 3-4.  2 players will have balance issues and 5-6 can drag the game out.

RATING: 7
Cool D&D card drawing game, it's got great artwork and sometimes very funny. My downside with it is that I'm never 100% sure of exactly what I should be doing? Tongue in cheek game which probably works best when you are back stabbing people maybe that's why it's not such a hit with my family we tend to play it nice, I guess we live by Dr Knizia's motto "'When playing a game, the goal is to win, but it is the goal that is important, not the winning".

RATING: 7
Fun and light parody of dungeon crawl gaming. Play this for fun with people in the right mood and you'll have a great time. My wife enjoys this, but she is not a typical female, as she has also played wargames in her teens. We normally don't advocate games of this caliber, but I think Munchkin is swell.

Read the latest set of rules. 

Again, you shouldn't play this for a serious game, but rather for a fun social silly time. This is in the same catergory as Killer Bunnies and Fluxx. Every gamer should have a closet nonsense game.

Though we love Munchkin, we now prefer to play Fluxx because it is better 2 player.

For the first game (or the first in a while) with a particular set, the cards are hilarious. After this, though, you've seen the jokes and the gameplay is unexciting.

The same comment goes for all of the variants. Haven't tried blending the sets - I imagine the play time would increase, and the jokes wouldn't really improve.

It's a great deck of jokes. The game isn't as good.

I immediately burnt my copy in the fire-pit during the wee first hours of NYD 2013.

The only reason I'm not rating it a 1 is that there are, very occasionally, actual decisions you can make.

Personally I think this is one of the most over rated games ever. First time I played it was kind of fun. But it's all about the silly card names and the monsters and once I've seen them all there is no more fun in it for me.

This game also suffers from alot of the players. It's constantly put forward to play, often more than once in a row. I find it pushed at me all the time like Settlers of Catan and I am a beliver that variety is the spice of life.

It's fine with players who share RPG experiences and want to whack each other. Better if played more often (because the first plays are usually utterly confusing). Suffers from "whack the leader" syndrome, badly. Winning is utterly random. Some jokes are funny, German translators put a lot of effort into it. Not a great design, though.

Fun but flawed dungeon crawling parody in card game form. The jokes and references on cards are great but start to wear out after couple of plays already. If cards would be more varied, gameplay more balanced and game would not drag so much in the end - it would be so much better game. The game does not start to drag every time, but when it does, it can be terrible.

Munchkin is not a 'drool' game compared to Descent or Smallworld. It's simple and not often picked for gaming bouts, almost like a red headed stepchild of sorts... But once it gets started, it's almost always a lot of fun and I realize that I've forgotten how amusing it can be. 

Talk about a backstabber, though! Play with good friends, because that may be tested.

This game was worth playing *once* for the amusement value. It became rather repetative, but at least had the "ooh, what's that card do?"-factor to keep it interesting. My second (and final) game dragged on interminably, and even when new cards came up, I just couldn't bring myself to care.

Played only the basic game. I don't like the rule "cheat in any ways you want but don't get caught!". It's not the IDEA of the board games to cheat and make others watch your every move that you wouldn't cheat..
There are of course a lot of rpg-humour. Too bad that those things won't be fun too long (well, maybe that's why this game have so many expansions).

Reading the cards is pretty fun.  The gameplay is mindless at first.  When you get close to the end, the gameplay is worse than mindless, as everyone teams up against whoever's turn it is.  Games can drag on for hours as nobody is able to beat the combination of every-other-player-at-once.

Love this game! Personally I have the Deluxe edition and several extension packs. The game is always fun, but the concept is sadly hard for some to understand. Playing with people that aren't the best reading English makes the game slower and is kind of a buzzkill. Luckily all that changes with more "adult" players that understands the craziness. 
You will laugh, cry, swear and hug during the game. It is frustrating cuz of the very random gaming style... But that keeps is interesting.
Nonetheless is is my favorite game.

This game is better than what people give it credit if only playing with the base set. Adding too many different expansions completely randomizes the game and makes it unfun. At that point, you might as well gather around a table and roll dice to see who can roll the highest to determine the winner.

Our first dive into strategy games as a family.  It captured our imagination in comparison to Life, Monopoly, Clue, and the like.  Lots of laughs when discovering new cards.

My very first modern board game.  I really don't know why I own this.  It takes far too long to finish a game, you don't really have a whole lot of control over how the game plays out, and it's just a lot of messing with other people and hoping you either walk into a fight that won't kill you or you walk into a fight that wins you the game.

If I play, I either play with the base game + xpacs alone, or with two of the subsets smashed up (Impossible Zombies, or Super Star). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is incredibly underrated and dismissed by more pretentious gamers. They are either too quick to falsely label the game as all luck or butt-hurt that it is mocking role-playing games, notably Dungeons and Dragons. The truth is there is plenty of strategy in the negotiations, by withholding cards in your hand and when you play them or go for levels.

Pros:
* Allows you to play a light RPG without investing so much time.
* Player interaction is great and creates a competitive but fun atmosphere.

Cons:
* The art work is poor.
* There should only be a deluxe edition, do not waste your time trying to play without the game board.

A lot of fun! Sure, by the end it's like being in first place on the final lap in a Mario Kart race but that's OK. I'm a huge fan of the "screw your friends over" style of games anyway. Make sure your gaming group isn't the type that gets mad when they get screwed over though or fights will start. It's all in good fun and if you go in with that type of attitude you are guaranteed to have a good time.

This game introduced me a second time to boardgames - I stopped playing for at least ten years once I got fed up with monopoly and the likes...- it has nice humor, nice player interaction (dealing, double crossing, trading), enough simple and complex rules to keep beginners and the moderately strategist interested. The stand alone only gets better with the expansions. I have introduced this game to about 10 other people and all enjoyed the humour and appreciated the competition. Note about the bgg rating: I don't quite get why Munchkins has so many people who bothered to review it but gave it an average 6 score. A lot of top 500 games seem to have a lot less reviews (ie interest) but seem to shine a lot more simply by having a smaller and more loving bunch of reviewers. All in all, a unique game and a lot of fun!

Dungeon crawling without the dungeon. Quite entertaining, especially with 4 or more players, but can get old without additional expansions. It's nice to see your character all geared up, than lose his stuff through the grace of other players. Alliances are formed and broken, all in good fun!

Munchkin, OG Munchkin, just the base set Munchkin.
That is all anyone would ever need don't mess about getting a million boxes and expansions. Get introduced to the hobby with it, play it, use it as an opener get your use out of it and eventually you will grow out of it and find something else.
It serves that purpose wonderfully.

Similar kind of game to Killer Bunnies - though this is slightly easier to teach and I find the cards a little funnier. Although both games are heavily dependent on chance, KB seems to allow just a few more opportunities to plan ahead once you know some of the cards.

Munchkin is a train wreck. I hate it. It's unnecessarily too long, there are no thought provoking decisions, it's completely random, and there is too much downtime for my liking. The whole point of the game is to king bash the leader which just prolongs the torturous experience. The worst part is that I see this game in stores all over the place and the general public thinks that this a good non-monopoly game. I cry a little inside whenever I hear someone say they enjoy Munchkin and all of its terrible expansions.

I have to give Munchkin props for being, along with Pandemic, my first foray into modern board games and during the beginning thinking that all those expansions that can be mixed and matched were so cool, but now after playing so many other games, I see it as mediocre.  Can't downplay the role it played into getting modern games into the mainstream though.

It's okay.  There's a tendency to gang up on the leader, which can be frustrating, but I personally think Munchkin is more about the journey than the destination.

RATING: 4
A random and sometimes amusing card game. Slow to start and doesn't really get exciting until the end, and even then I've had a fair number of runaway leaders that win too quickly.

6.5 - I've been unknowingly playing the last version printed before they overhauled the rules, the game is something I'm usually down for depending on the number of people who show up.  

I found out that the very next printing of the game after the version I was given as a gift updated the rules including larger starting hands, removing a lot of negatives that the newer expansion cards didn't seem to have, and clarifications of a bunch of rules that we had simply house ruled because there was no explanation.  I have printed the new rules and will be using them in my next game so the score may change.

*****
The new rules helped but the game is still a bit too long for it's own good.  I picked up the Adventure Time Munchkin and like that version enough to buy the board to track levels.  The odd thing is AT: Munchkin is the same game, but it doesn't feel as mean.

RATING: 7
Iconic game that's a nice addition to any collection.

The game itself is a big whack-the-leader cycle where players will most likely take turns being the leader. There's a high amount of luck and randomness in the game, if you're looking for a strategic move along.

I really like the artwork and I find the puns and humor very funny. All in all I think it's a great party game that is particularly great for first-time players.

Weaknesses:

* Not as funny the second time since you've already seen all the puns.
* It's a bit long for a party game. I wouldn't mind playing until level 7-8 instead of 10.

In a similar vein to MtG, Munchkin is a game system made by sellouts for people with no taste and the money to prove it. Buy the base game, maybe one expansion or spinoff, and then STOP. This game is fun with a group of good friends, but there are so many better games out there.

RATING: 2
Pretty bad. 
Mostly gang up on the leader, while waiting for the special card to help you come up. So there is a lot of randomness and take that in a game for way too long.

The cards are full of inside jokes, good for one play, then who cares. For me since I never was an RPG player, I never got the joke the first time so it I didn't care from the start.

This game sucks. The cards have great art and the jokes are really funny, if you're a gamer, but there is no game. There is nearly no player interaction (which, I think is essential for a good game) and you don't even get all the parts you need to "play". Stinker. How this series keeps winning awards is a mystery to me. Not one person I've introduced this game to has ever asked to play it again. That sure says something.

Disappointed with what comes with this game - the cards, the (overly long and silly) rules, no dice or counters, which you need to be able to play. Only tried to play once so far, which proved very confusing and we gave up after half an hour. The rules as written do not allow for a quick way into the game. Will no doubt try and play again at some point, as after seeing the rigged demo on the Munchkin website, the game mechanics are a lot clearer. Not a roleplayer, so a lot of the humour is probably lost on me anyway ... Not one for younger kids.

Four reasons to hate Munchkin:

1. The jokes get old fast
2. It's too complex for non-gamers and not complex enough for gamers
3. There is a huge runaway leader problem, and the game is largely random
4. It takes way too long

One reason you might love it:
This game is off-the walls crazy.

I've always been up for a nice round of in-character or board-game backstabbing and Munchkin is the one thing that lends itself to that... endlessly. The cardnames and effects get old very quickly, but it doesn't really detract from the fun of pissing off a few mates as they try to battle that lvl 4 monster that's now lvl 19, because you happened to have the proper cards. Sadly, the game mechanics are lacking for 2 players, so I will have to find more people to play with ;)

A játék jellemzője, hogy erősen party-játék, azaz eleve több játékossal érdemes nekikezdeni. Az is fontos, hogy a játékosok valamilyen szinten fantasy rajongók legyenek, valamint ne álljon tőlük távol a humor sem. A Munchkin sajátos humorral bír, ami nem biztos, hogy mindenkinek bejön. Sajnos ezek alapján elmondható, hogy a Munchkin erősen rétegjáték.

Nem tudom, hogy csak a magyar verzió sajátossága-e, de nem valami jó minőségűek a kártyák, valamint elég hülye megoldás, hogy úgy kell mindent beleömleszteni a dobozba.

Lehetett volna két kártyatartó, vagy másfajta dobozos megoldás.

A játékszabály sem igazán egyértelmű, és így elsőre nem is volt tökéletesen érthető. Lehet jó lett volna valahol látni egy próbajátékot, hogy miként is kellene ennek működnie.

Frissítés 1: Egy picit módosítottam a véleményemen. Pár játékot le kellett játszani, hogy megértsem a felszín alatt húzódó "szépségét". Így 6-osra módosítottam 5-ösről az értékelést.

This game can be very fun, however sometimes it drags on forever. It takes a good group to make this game fun. Part of the fun of this game is that the rules are loosely defined so things can be up for interesting interpretations. Though some people like rigid sets of rules and this makes not fun for them.

The Deluxe version is a few extra dollars but the board and characters is a really nice addition.

A very tongue in check type of game that pokes fun of fantasy RPGs. This game hasn't gotten stale for me, but I know that this is a very common problem for a lot of people.

There are 3 types of views on this game:
1)  You don't get the references and don't fully appreciate the game.
2)  The references are good for a few laughs at first, then gets old real fast.
3)  You really like the game.

My favorite card is the "Buckler of Swashing".

Own all basic expansions.

* 9/20/08 - original w/all 5 expansions

Yes, it has problems, the biggest of which being how players will savagely attack anyone who is close to winning, which can cause games to be long and drawn out.  It also punishes those who are doing the best.  But other than that, its a very interactive game and can be a heck of a lot of fun with a good group of people.  It may have flaws, but is always a fun time nonetheless.

I used to adore this game. It's still fun for some party chaos but not as a "favourite game". I still like the humour on the cards and gameplay is exciting at times, but when everyone's Level 9 and waiting to exhaust their cards, it gets pretty tedious.

I enjoy it but it's a hit or miss with different groups. Feels very mario kart-ish in the sense of being "blue shelled" at the end of the game. Some people don't seem to like "winning" for most of the game and then getting thrown to last place the turn before they would win.

One of the best card games on the market. If you can learn how to trick your opponents, cheat without getting caught and gang up when someone hit level 9 then you can really enjoy this game. We keep a copy on demo in our store because once you play you're hooked. The expantions are great too. A great geeky game.

I'm both really surprised and not surprised that this game is not popular on bgg.  It is really fun for a game with people who do not play heavy board games, but just like catan, it really just becomes a 'lets all stop player X from winning' game until someone sneaks in and takes a win when other players run out of monster buffing cards.

Munchkin is fun the first time playing it, if you have played old school rpgs and get all the silly references and jokes.  After the jokes get old, the game is too long and not very exciting.  I'd wager that 90% of games end because everyone is tired of playing and finally lets someone win.  The game is wretched with only 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A classic that I've moved on from.

Hits this weird spot that a lot of lightweight games suffer from. Has enough depth for 15-30m of play, but because of the level ping-ponging, you end up playing for an hour longer than you care to. 

Holds a spot easily filled by other games, even in groups that aren't particularly game savvy. Would rather play a shorter lightweight (ex: We Didn't Playtest This At All), or an actual dungeon crawler (ex: Talisman).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Munchkin is a fun game and I enjoy the humor/spoof aspect of role playing games.  If you've never played before, by all means its something you should try and I'm sure you will enjoy.

 My only issue is after a few games with friends we all just started piling on to each other, so getting to the end of the game turns difficult at times.  I would still gladly play from time-to-time, but it's not the first thing I suggest on a game night.

My wife and I are old-school role-players, and recently I have been trying to inject games back into my life. Unfortunately, it's hard to find fellow gamers when you're in your mid-thirties. After trying unsuccessfully to get her into Zombies!!! (not engaging enough for her), I went out and bought Munchkins after reading good things about it. Success! She loved the RPG related humor, and was eager enough to play again that I bought some more expansion packs. Say what you will, humor goes a long way to winning over the reluctant gamer. Now if they could just create a card game based on the old Paranoia RPG...

Ultimately I have to go with the conventional wisdom on this game and its many variants.  The cards and artwork are fun, but the gameplay is so-so, and the games almost always end the same way:  

Someone gets to 9th level and makes a play for the win.  All the other players expend cards to stop him, and succeed.  Then the *next* person to get to 9th level and make a play for the win succeeds, because all the good cards were expended.

First game I've ever rated after one play - hopefully I never have to play it again.

I hate everything about this game. The artwork is definitely not my cup of tea. The game is incredibly luck dependent - impossible to make strategies as everything you do comes down to the cards you draw.

Hard to express what I dislike the most as everything this game has to offer is terrible.
I usually enjoy take that A LOT - but the way this game deals with it is too chaotic and boring.

so much potential, but many mechanics (race/class/items) get bogged down in large deck sizes with expansions. Often the opening cards are highly indicative of the winner, unless everyone else at the table is feeling petty and are willing to spend everything they have to bring him down.

It's Munchkin, some people hate it, some people love it. I'm one of the later...

RATING: 6
Munchkin has offered a few nights of fun between different friend groups. The game, at it's core, is a social experience. While the game boasts as being a simplified dungeon crawling card game, it lacks in making me feel like I am.

What the game does poorly: Strategy is a bit of a joke. Most of the time you are hoping not to get some overpowered monster to ruin your day. Items are simple, but keeping track of what you and your opponents have can get overbearing at times.

What the game does well: Each play session is a test in who you should or should not trust. Alliances are made and broken in the same turn, and most of the time I felt like I was making some big negotiation just to defeat a monster, which was interesting. The art and jokes are silly and simple and the game does not take itself too seriously.

If you are a D&D guy that thinks that some people take their D&D a bit too seriously, you must play this game. It's not a totally cool, awesomely balanced game, but it's fun. And funny.

I knew I was in for something cool with Boots of Butt-Kicking and the first rule stating...

"To determine who goes first, roll the die and argue about the outcome and whether this sentence is missing some text"

Hilarious.

However, beyond that??? Look at the cards and have a laugh, but skip playing the actual game - you can thank me later for the advice.

Munchkin is almost enjoyable the first time you play. Repeated plays are just "more of the same". It does have good player interaction, but I never enjoyed playing it after the first time. Especially since games tend to start going on too long, players hoard cards which allow them to stop the leader from winning - leading to some games which last forever.

Haven't played expansions, but struggle to see how they could improve it.

Not a game for me.

RATING: 3
Update on 2/18/2018 (4 -> 3): This game is irredeemable, and I suspected as much. 

The ever-growing line of Munchkin naysayers grows by one. All that was said was true: the game is a chore to play. It is a repetitive exercise in futility, rife with randomness, player elimination, king-maker. The fundamental flaw is when everyone has learned to horde cards until someone is in danger of winning. This will, as you might expect, delay the game to no discernible end until by some stroke of luck no one has cards to stymie the win. Such a situation is less likely to happen at high player counts with more hands to choose from to dole out death to the pending winner, which is unfortunate as the game itself thrives on player dynamics and banter.

(+) Loads of player interaction.
(+) Backstabbing, subversion, and guile are all the name of the game.
(+) Fairly straight-forward game sequence of play. Decent introductory-type game but nowhere near my gateway game of choice.

(-) An abundance of text to read throughout the game.
(-) An excess of cards that are designed to throttle the endgame scoring condition (and a faulty player metagame to complement it)
(-) Far too much randomness for my liking.

Ok, cards are really funny (and if you are a rpg geek, you'll find them even more funny), but the gameplay is orrible, incredibly boring. After you've read the 110 cards, you can forget the game.

RATING: 3
An interesting premise and humorous game that is inviting and fun to begin...But the game just seems to drag when trying to reach a conclusion.  During this conclusion, began to feel the game a bit more random than I would have liked.  Especially the winner is not the person who played the best, but rather the person who can get the chance for victory while others have exhausted their counter-plays.  For a shorter version of that mechanism involving humour, I would much rather spend the time with Dr. Lucky due to its brevity compared to Munchkin.

Interesting enough on its own, my rating goes up a point or two if in the presence of D&D/Shadowrun/Other Pencil&Paper players -- Alcohol can work on a tougher crowd too. (Sometimes you can even switch this in place of an ongoiong 'Apples to Apples' game.) =P

RATING: 6
Munchkin has a cute D&D lite theme but is essentially a "take that" style card game that becomes easily unbalanced. Better with more players, not great for just me and my husband. Might be a good drinking game but just pick up Drunk Quest instead--same cute theme but you skip the hit points and go straight to drinking alcohol instead--brilliant.

It's like a filler, but takes longer. I like my fillers to be short. Maybe go to level 7 or 8, not 10. I figured it out, I don't like the everyone vs one player at the end. And then once everyone stops the clearly the best and most prepared person to win someone else just waltzes in. I might would play if we played with 6 players and only the people on the left and right could affect you or only the people in the same, 1 up, or 1 down room from you can help or do bad things to you.

RATING: 4
A quite random and silly "take that" game that drags on too long.  I kind of wish I liked it more than I do, since the idea amuses me.  Its positive points are:
1. The rules seem fairly clear and unambiguous (impressive for such a card game with zillions of special effects).
2. Often stupidly humorous text and art on the zillions of cards.
I played it once before years ago in Austin, then again at Gumowa Róża 2008-07-01.  Possibly once every few years is about right.

05-06-2014. Commented after a while since last playing Munchkin. Well, I do not hate Munchkin. I do not think it's a very good game though. Lots of screwage, which I like. What I do not like is that the game tends to go long and outstays it's welcome.

The game provides some fun and backstabbery. The game is mostly luck-based. If you do not get items or easy defeatable enemies, you're in bad shape. If you do get those, you'll win. 

The end game often devolves in bashing the leader, due to which the guy in 3rd place often wins because everyone has exhausted all their options on the first two guys winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love the tongue-in-cheek theme. I like that the game is fairly accessible. 
I dislike how this game can take bash-the-leader to a whole new level. I hate it that the game can drag on for hours. There really isn't enough to it to justify such a lengthy playing time.

RATING: 6.99
Have you ever fantasy role-played? Do you have a sense of humor? If you answered yes to BOTH questions, then give this card game a try. This game is a humorous take on fantasy adventuring where players sabotage each other until the very end. Not for players who tend to take things too seriously. Fun with a group of players who enjoy a good dungeon crawl, only this dungeon is filled with the hilarious, the absurd and everything in between! Players seem to either love Munchkin or hate it. Try it and judge for yourself.

I have to say that I did not like this game when I got it. It was boring and dumb when no one helped each other. But with a large group of people playing and having a good time, this game is pretty good. I would not rank this too high only because it doesn't take much skill to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Played one game and never again. I just don't like the randomness of it. The "humor" never appealed to me, and I enjoy the occasional RPG game. There is no battle system, which was what I was really hoping for when the game was introduced. Simply just add numbers and hope your number is greater than the monsters number.

I couldn't stand the game so much that when the person who was ahead was going to win, I chose not to screw them over just so the game could end. I had a card to make the monster +10 levels and he would have dropped 2 levels and I may have ended up winning the game since I was pretty close. I just couldn't take the chance.

This game is usually a hit or miss.  The cards are really funny to D&D players, confusing for others.  You need the right number of people.  But once it gets going, it is fairly involved, and snatching the win away from someone is always fun, but tends to make the game drag on.  Last time we played, we let someone win for the sake of ending the game.

--Jan2006-- Well, I'd managed to survive this long without playing.  But now the humor is right in my 11 year old's wheelhouse, and he finds it irresistible.  It's a take-that (which ain't my favourite.)  It's cheesy.  On the other hand, having an enthusiastic opponent is pretty nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not beginner friendly, or a gateway game I'd recommend. Bad instruction manual that opts for using wisecracks instead of simple explanations. When the game gets going, it does, but things can slow down if you have inexperienced players on the table learning the game.

Super cute art, funny card text, and gameplay that is easily accessible to even non-gamers, guarantee that this card game has its place.
However...
Leveling up and "kill the leader," now "kill the new leader" that sometimes goes on for FAR too long ensures that I'll only play this once or twice a year.

It is unfair to give Munchkin such low rate. The killer is language and culture. The highlight of Munchkin is its sarcastic language and humorous comic, which lose 99% of the essence after translation. The humour is tragically lost, which means 99% of the game is gauged off. Sorry my dear Munchkin.

I enjoyed some Munchkin in my day, but some games got dragged out way too long (had one game that lasted 6 hours before someone finally drained everyone of their negative cards enough that they could eek out a win uncontested). I really think this game should come with an hour long timer, that once it goes off, you end the game and whoever has the highest level at that point is the winner. Because everyone constantly delaying the win for turn after turn after turn for hours is what makes this game such a bore. Everything else in the game is actually pretty clever and fun.

I've only played the Epic version once, but highly recommend giving it a shot. Essentially, you draw two Door cards per turn, and go up to level 20.

At first, this seems like Munchkin, only twice as long. But, as you go past 15th level, it's much more difficult to stop players from winning combats. And, since you may have two monster combats in your last turn, players now must use their "take that" cards *two* levels before someone potentially wins.

Oh, and it doesn't hurt when you defeat two high-level monsters, draw six treasure cards, play two "Gain a Level" treasures, and go up four or five levels in one turn...! 

*****

To win at Munchkin:
a) Do not be the first person to attempt level 9 to 10.
b) Hold a low-level monster card in your hand.

I don't get how BGG, a strategy boardgames site, doesn't understand what should be a basic strategy. (BGG also doesn't understand trading in Chez Dork, nor the "advanced" rules in Spooks.)

I prefer the Munchkin Cthulhu alternate victory conditions. If all players are Cultists, the game ends and the highest-level player wins. But if only one player is left as a non-Cultist, he gains a level (even at 9th level) and can win. But, as more players become Cultists, each Cultist becomes more powerful. Heck of a balancing mechanism.

I also don't recommend Munchkin with more than four players. I also don't understand why BGG understands you shouldn't play Dominion with more than four players, yet plays BGG with more than four.

Not really a good game. It's easy to teach at least, but it isn't really a fun game. It's only really fun if you like the humor. I do not like the humor. This isn't really a good family game, because some of the humor is a bit too adult for young kids. What little actual gameplay is there is mostly a series of "take that" style gameplay. It's fairly short at least. 60 min is actually about how long a game takes.

This is a fantastically fun game but it can only be played with a group of like-minded players.  The goal of Munchkin is not to try to win, it's to try to keep everyone else from winning.  If that doesn't sound like fun to you then Munchkin is not a game for you.

RATING: 6
I thought this was really cool when I first played it, but also worried that there might be too much luck involved.  I was right about the latter, and now feel mostly wrong about the former.  This game is definitely filler material, which might be OK if not for the fact that it really lends itself to overstaying its welcome, due to the tendency of players to gang up on anybody who approaches the win.  This both prolongs the game and takes away the satisfaction of victory, since the winner will be the one who stood poised to win at the time when all other players finally ran out of means (which are just cards that create differences in combat scores; nothing clever) to hurt one another.  Thus, I'm left feeling firm that this is only suitable as a filler, and also not sure when exactly would be the right time to play this; if I can be sure I have time for this, then I probably have enough time to play something more fulfilling.  Even in the category of "Fillers that are sort of too long to be fillers and don't feel smart to play", I feel this is outclassed by Boss Monster.

Random as all hell, basically no skill involved whatsoever.  It's a chaotic, mindless, mess of a game.  I have to deduct points for that.  But I'll be damned if it isn't one of the funniest, funnest little games out there.  Well, as long as you have the right group.  As long as the guys and gals you're playing with know that the game is all about silly randomness and being a complete dick to the person next to you without really meaning it, Munchkin is awesome.  It has its limitations, hence the 6, but I'd still recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of whimsical murdery fun.

Thought this was going to be HORRIBLE, after hearing all the negative reviews. It wasn't HORRIBLE, it was just plain; mundane; and kind of gave me a migraine. There wasn't anything too horrible about it that made me swear it off or anything, but at the same time there wasn't really anything special about it either. It can definitely drag on way too long, and I can see how repeated plays would lessen the charm and whimsy of the cards, but it was okay. Just okay.

Munchkin is a wretched grinding exercise in pain and agony.  Like pretty much every Steve Jackson game, it putts along reasonably until someone is close to winning, at which point it becomes an exercise in attempting to make the winning move and getting smacked down by screw-you cards until someone manages to get lucky by trying to win when everyone else is momentarily depleted (or simply sick of it and no longer care who wins so long as the game ends now).  The cards are funny to read, once, if you're fan of RPGs, and that's its only redeeming value.

Long dungeon crawler game. The competition and cooperative aspects work well with each other. Building up your character and everyone coming together to take out one player about to win is always fun. Love this game

Visual Appeal: (3)
The game looks OK. Nothing is a standout. Some of the art is funny, but that is the most it has going for it. Fits nicely in small play areas.

Components: (3)
It's really only cards. No issues here. They are of semi decent stock and rounded edges. Not bad but not pretty. 

Theme: (2)
The theme is standard, but a lacks complexity that I want for dungeon crawl RPG. There are tons of expansions that all seem more interesting, but since I don't care for basic game, I have no reason to try them.

Learning: (4)
This game is really easy to teach to a large group. everyone is going to be doing roughly the same things anyway. Actions are printed clearly on the card. I don't recall if I learned this game from the rulebook. I think this was a gift and I was taught by another player in my first game.

Gameplay: (2)
Not that the game doesn't have interaction. It does, but everything serves to slow the game down. To win you must level up, but everyone is constantly trying to level other players down. It can be targeted and outright mean sometimes. Usually I like that kind of thing, but I had one game so frustratingly long that I had to call it off. Mechanisms that make the game difficult by prolonging it are not good mechanisms

Overall Fun: (2)
When I owned this game, I remember it was a mood flipper. I went into it really excited and came out equally as disappointed as I had been excited. I think it has something to do with working hard to build up your score only to watch it be torn down by other players and relentless monsters. But, but, but...I need that to win! Or, to just end the game! When will it end if we can't progress???

RATING: 7
The best part of this game is all the silly puns and goofy art on the cards. Overall it's fun, if you like random games. It can drag on as everyone keeps thwarting everyone else from getting that final level. After a while you get tired of adding up bonuses over and over again.

Rather than rate every single Munchkin version, I am just going to state that I give them all a "7". So, to calculate the true rating of a Munchkin variant that I haven't explicitly rated, multiply the current rating by the number of raters, add 7, then divide by the current number of raters + 1. If you've played lots of Munchkin you should be able to do this easily.

RATING: 5
Not a very deep game, but an enjoyable filler if everyone a) is in the right mood and b) likes D&D in-jokes. If you're a console RPG fan the level grinding and stuff collecting will really appeal to you. If you're not a die-hard RPGer, you probably want to give this game a miss. 

It's not as bad as it's made out to be, but way overpriced for what you get in the box (A$50 will buy you a copy of China, or an ASL Starter, or staying in the realm of overpriced card games with shitty components, a copy of Modern Art). Rules are poorly written also.

The bottom line is that for D&D fans it's worth playing now and then (too often would wear out the jokes), but probably not worth buying at the asking price.

This game is vicious riot.  Players take on the roles of "level one humans with no class" and the humor goes on from there.  The theme plays up the stereotypical dungeon crawl backed by mechanics that have you kicking down doors, killing monsters, and taking their stuff.  The first person to level 10 wins the game, but with all the backstabbing opportunities in this game it's not likely you'll get to level 10 without someone forcing some Bad Stuff to happen to you.  Players can interfere to help you (by distracting monsters or making them weaker) or hurt you (by adding monsters or making them tougher).

The lightness of the cards and the snarky rules help to alleviate the backstabbing pain.  Best played in larger groups of good friends who can be cruel without being mean.  Best played with people with a good and dry sense of humor.

A fun party game, but too long and doesn't work as a filler. The humour is great, but once you know the cards it starts to wear off, and when you don't, you have to read through them slowing the gameplay. Would play again for social reasons, but it's not the best gaming experience.

When it's new, it's a blast. But after some plays you realize there is not much control. I'd rather play something else now. Only play with a large deck. Reduces the luck that only one player gets good items, but also increases the number of "weak" monsters which can speed munchkin up to a 10 minute game!

RATING: 8
A hilarious card-game parody of Dungeons & Dragons.  Players represent characters collecting treasure, killing monsters, and back-stabbing their buddies.  The rules are simple and the replay value is quite high.  There are2 types of cards: Dungeon cards (monsters and effects) and Treasure cards (loot and other goodies).  The goal is to be the first player to reach level 10 by selling items, killing monsters, and playing certain treasure cards.  Knowledge of D&D and role-playing isn't required, but it does make the game that much more fun.

Everything you've heard about Munchkin is true, from both sides of the argument. It's goofy fun, with a lot of thematic gags and take-that mechanics. But it lasts way too long, and tends to drag at the end as everyone is preventing everyone else from closing the win.

Nice little game, easy to learn, great to play. But I find that if people don't know about D&D, they just won't understand the fun of this game. :) Too many jokes that require being in touch with boardgamer popculture.

The game itself is fun, and really a feast of backstabbing your friends as much as you can, while trying to come out on top.

Great introduction to card based RPGs. Lots of themed versions such as Marvel and Adventure Time which in my opinion are better if you are a fan of that show or theme outside of the game. Enjoyment is predicated somewhat on who you play with. It can get one sided pretty quickly.

RATING: 7
I'm sure there's not much to say that hasn't already been said about Munchkin. I enjoy the game, especially with an expansion or two. The artwork is fun and whimsical and there is plenty of humor inherent in the game. It's generally fun, light, and easy to get into.

My major gripe is that I always feel like the game runs too short. It's not until people are at level 9 or 10 that crazy card combos seem to come out and people really start going crazy buffing monsters or countering with items. I feel like it's more fun to play to 15 or 20 levels to really get the full experience of the game and the crazy card interactions that can appear.

I would definitely recommend an expansion or two though. More variety definitely improves the experience. I currently own Munchkin Booty and the Pathfinder expansions and I wouldn't play without at least one of them.

Absolutely terrible. Moderately funny cards, but the gameplay is awful. The game has a very low level of complexity that is not fun for the majority of the two-hour playtime. The game also provides the worst example of "bash the leader" gameplay in all of gaming. There is next to no strategy. You simply hope that everyone expends all of their cards keeping the person to your right from winning so that you can skate to victory. Probably the most boring and least fun game I've ever played.

This game seems to get a lot of flak, but I love the corny puns and D&D jokes, and the game mechanics are pretty simple and easy to get a grasp on. The one problem I have is that this game is ripe for ganging up on the leader in a way that makes me never want to be the first to level 9. That element seems a little unbalanced, as I've seen people blow all their cards defeating the first attempt at level 10, only to see the next person fly through easily because no one has any cards left to stop them.

I will admit to playing most of the new expansions once - just to see the new jokes.  As someone has pointed out to me, this game explicitly includes a rule that allows cheating.

Munchkin is a fun casual game, though its humor is geared at people who have some experience with RPGs.

This is a game that gets incrementally better with each expansion. If you're going to get the game, plan to get the add-ons as well. Just be warned that these add-ons will add a lot of extra time to your game. Munchkin can get pretty epic.

Or, try "Munchkin Bites" or "Star Munchkin," (with their associated expansions), both of which are much faster to play and just as fun.

The best part about this game is looking at the cards, particularly if you are an old D&D player like me.  Many of them are at least a little amusing and some are quite witty.  Unfortunately, you are then expected to play a game with them.  The game is an interesting (read amusing) reduction of an RPG campaign to a card game.  Sure it's pretty random, but there is some skill involved (particularly in regards to negotiation) with a fair amount of take-that, screw your neighbor stuff on the side.  As a half hour game, this would not be all that bad.  However, it is way too long for what it ends of being -- an exercise in seeing who can reach level nine and survive until no one has anything bad left to throw at them.  Winning is actually pretty anti-climactic after that. [5]
---------------------------------------------------------
Addendum: I've since played this with a less cutthroat group of players.  They are helpful almost to a fault, saving the beatdown stuff until people hit level 8 or 9.  This makes the game go a lot more quickly and thus makes it a lot more tolerable.  Still, it only bumps the game up to a 6 overall.  [02/02/2008]

As long as the players agree not to continually pile up on someone when they're about to win this game is just amusing and entertaining.

Just my personal opinion though.

Call Munckin stupid and what have you, but it's intuitive and easy to pick up. The theme works and is attractive one at that (fantasy) and everybody has a clear idea what they should do. The basic game has a clear problem: not enough take that cards to stop everybody's attempt to win. But I take it as a ride and not a competition anyhow. Munchkin Quest is better even if even longer.

I like playing this game with people who don't care if they win. Playing with those kinds of people, in this game, kinda make it not fun anymore. They're the ones that have memorized all the cards and have a good idea about what's coming up etc. etc.

The rules for this game take a little while to get straight in your head - there is a definite sequence of events when it is a players turn.  We've had this game for quite a while and have all of the expansion packs added in.  We still love to play, although we want at least 3 people - there isn't much point with just two players.  The sense of humor on the cards is very funny.

Too goofy and kiddy for me. Seems a tad too random. For what it is it takes too long to play.

Really enjoy this. D&D without all the storytelling stuff.  Just stab your friends in the back and win.  I love the humor element they put into the cards. It makes fun of itself as the game goes.

RATING: 3.5
A take-take style game with bash the leader mechanics. This series of games are popular with RPGers but most 'see the light' after playing real Eurogames and subsquently give up on Munchkins.

Overpriced and very ho-hum gameplay. Can drag a little.

Pieces: A few

This game is a lot of fun. Easy for new players to pick up and perfect for a party setting.

The artwork isn't that great, kind of a cross between Charlie Brown and some unheard of newspaper comic strip. What it lacks in beauty, it makes up for in humor. The names of the monsters and items can get pretty hilarious. The rules can be a bit iffy sometimes, but nothing so bad to slow down gameplay.

If you see it and have money to burn, pick it up

I enjoyed playing it when I first started playing card games, but after trying much better games it's hard to get back into it.

The game it's fun specially with the  right group of people, but it takes too long and in the end winning it's just a matter of good luck. I'd play it from time to time if not in the mood for playing other "more serious" games.

Finally got to play this last weekend.  Pretty dependent on the group mindset and the number of players.  Don't think this is going to get a lot of play with my core group though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
It took me 2 plays to realize this is not a game for me.  It works in if you are leading everyone will jump on you preventing the game from ending.  The humour in this game is over the top and grows old quick and lets be honest it is the only reason to play the game as the random nature and take that nature of the game mean you might as pick numbers between 1 - 100 then randomly choose a number and the closes person to the number wins.  It just takes 3+ hours.  Great game if it could be played in 5 minutes but otherwise it is just bad.  This goes for all munchkin expansion/spin-offs as well.

I'm grouping the expansions in this as I have them all.  This game was nice at the start and I had some good laughs.  I think that it lost its good balance after combining everything though.  It combines into 2 gigantic decks that make it so you don't repeat that much which is great, but the balance of what types of cards you get is not the same as it use to.  I should probably try to fix it at some point.  Also, after awhile it just got a bit old.

Used to have a lot of fun playing this because of the amusing cards, and the dicking over of your friends. But now I hate the fact that you can spend an hour at level 1 because you don't get an appropriate monster to fight while everyone else gets levels and good stuff and storms ahead, and the second person to draw a monster at level 9 will win (since the first person to do this gets hit with all of everyone's saved-up debuffs/monster buffs).

This game is really fun and once you've learnt the rules is quick and easy. I introduced 3 new people, 2 of whom were not game players, and they loved it. One of them even wanted to try roleplaying after this. It's fun and I can't wait to get the expansions.

Further plays indicate this game is best taken light heartedly and played with people who accept its nature as a backstabbing 'stick it to them all from minute one' style.

Az eddigi egyetlen rossz választásom társasjátékok terén a saját gyűjteményem növelésénél. Ezen elrettentő mondat után jöjjön a játék dicsérete. Kártyajáték komoly szerepjátékosok számára komolytalan kikapcsolódáshoz. Fantasztikusan humoros szövegekkel és rajzokkal megalkotott kártyák. Hősünkkel kincsek után kutatva egymás után rúgjuk be a kazamaták ajtajait. Társainkkal versengve próbáljuk minél több szörny legyőzésével leghamarabb elérni a 10. tapasztalati szintet. Ebben különböző módon a legrosszabb átkokat vetik be ellenünk és hatalmas pusztító szörnyeket küldenek ránk.
És hogy ezek után miért 3-as nálam a játék. Egyrészt kimondott konfrontációs játék. Az egymással való minél nagyobb kicseszés a játék lényege. Ez sajnos nem az én világom. Másrészt a játék a következőképp zajlik: Az első szintek elérése mindenki számára nyögvenyelős, mert a kis szintű szörnyekre várunk. Utána viszont mindenki gyorsan eléri a 8., 9. szintet, ahonnan viszont általában szerencsével lép fel valaki a 10-re.
Biztos vagyok benne, hogy a kiegészítők kellően színesítik a játékot és ezt a dolgot is kiküszöbölik, de mivel nem az én világom én nem próbálgattam.

Sometimes the game takes too long - especially demoralizing when you're close to winning and disaster strikes.  Sometimes keeping track of how many items you can have is also difficult.  But it is funny, and it is interactive, and if we're in the mood it's a fun game.  My kids made me a couple of "expansion cards" for my birthday, and you could mod it like crazy if you wanted to.

A fairly good game. It's a little easy at times and one player can run away with it all... You can also end up with A LOT of cards to manage which can become a bit overwhelming at times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
The first one or two times this game is completely hilarious, but after you know the illustrations and names and start to get down to the game mechanics, it becomes a real pain. It is so unbalanced that it is not fun anymore (may be intended, but read it again to know why this is bad). You may be completely screwed if you get bad draws and can not do anything against it. If you just encounter traps and huge monsters there is nothing you can do while watching other people go on to win. If the game would be over after half an hour this would not be so bad, but it can easily take more than two hours. This definitely crosses the line for me. I never saw a game which so many people did not enjoy, the only one that has the potential to equal Munchkin in this area is Zombies!!!

I hate, no---I detest this game. Intense randomness and Take That mechanics punish players for somehow finding a way to effectively apply bits of strategy in the form of combos together.

The amount of fun you have with this game roughly correlates to your group. I've never played with anybody who didn't have a good time with this game. My husband and I also play a two-player variant (look it up in the Munchkin forums) of it and still have fun. My only qualm with this game is occasionally not wanting to hurt other players' feelings and so level 9 ends up becoming the point where we actually play the game.

Complexity: Easy

Fantasy-themed party card game.  The quirky humor and interaction in this game is appealing. The problem is that this game often far overstays its welcome, ultimately devolving into a game of "last man standing after everyone unloads their cards to screw the current leader."  As a result, I think it's way too long for what it is, but I know some folks enjoy it.

I have a near-hatred of this game and, by extension, all Steve Jackson games in general. I cannot [i]believe[/i] the number of expansions they've released for this thing.

The cards themselves? Moderately funny. Do yourself a favor: read through all of the cards then put the game up for trade, saving yourself the drudgery of playing a mechanically bland filler that goes on and on for-absolutely-ever since it's so easy to kick the leader in the teeth.

Edit: I played the sci-fi version with three players and it actually wasn't bad. I can't see playing with more players than that, though.

Okay! This is going to be a long comment on this game. When I first played it, I had a lot of fun. People did damage to each other, but kept it strategic. As time wore on with this game, I found that it got meaner and meaner and the game itself promoted cheating, especially as a marketing thing. I am disappointed at the level this game became, and believe that is what broke the game for me.

First play was exactly what I imagined. I like this kind of game once in a while(Cosmic Encounter, Descartes Blue Box, Ivanhoe, etc...)

I'll have to play again with less than 6 players to really have a clear idea of the game.

At first glance, it seemed a bit long for what it does.

I don't understand the low rating on BGG, this is a great game. I've had a lot of very fun nights with this one.  Once played for three hours, and nobody was in the least bit bored or tired.  Fun, so long as you can be ok with (and hopefully enjoy) the backstabbing of friends and being backstabbed.  What it does, it does very well, I think.

RATING: 8
A fun relaxing game. Don't expect much tactics apart from who you're going after (usually the one with the highest level obviously). The game is mostly about making partnerships, negotiating something for yourself if you help others and making the life of those high levels a lot harder. The cards are very funny and it's a relaxing parody card game, usually causes a lot of laughter and it's not that mean as it sounds, people usually don't get angry because you just boosted plutonium dragon to be lvl 42 or something. It's just a fun relaxing game and I like it a lot.

RATING: 5.5
Munchkin is a profoundly flawed game that is immensely fun to play with the right crowd, in the right mood, at the right time.  It's also not the sort of game that holds up over very many plays.  Had I rated this after my first couple of plays, I'd likely have given it an 8.  Now, much later, it's just not the same.  Once you've exhausted the laughter, there's just plain better card games out there that remain fun (and funny) no matter how many times you take them out.  Lastly, for the typical MSRP, you're not really getting a whole heck of a lot -- bang for your buck is pretty low here in comparison with other similar games.  (Still a dirtcheap way to have fun, though, so I can't complain!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
I'm not into role playing games, so a parody of that genre might appeal to a certain group, but definitely not me.  Game drags on endlessly with very little decision making.  A few of the cards struck me as humorous and there is a small amount of strategy to elevate it above Fluxx-like status.  Hated it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I used to be a fan but my wife and many others in my regular game group were not.  As an RPG'er I loved the theme and enjoyed the cut-throat gameplay.  Games can sometimes drag and there can also be a huge kingmaker problem but I usually had fun with it.

That is, until I played similar yet much, much better games and I realized the only thing connecting me to Munchkin was the "in-humor" for RPG players.

This is an annoying game for a couple of reasons:
1. For some reason it just seems to take way to long to finish. I always find myself thinking, "Ok this should be over soon." and then waiting 30 for it to finally grind to a halt.
2. Explaining the rules to new players is horrible. Absolutely horrible.
3. Too much text for too little payoff. Unless everyone already knows the cards you spend a lot of time sitting around in silence while everyone reads what they have.

How did I end up with three different versions of this?

I have yet to *not* have a great time playing Munchkin (or one of its variants). It helps that I often play with new people and I have all the expansions, which works to keep the humor fresh. And that I love screwing people over more than I do winning. A deep-thinking strategy game it is not, but in my book (with the right people), more fun cannot be had without breaking the law.

There is one sole reason this game gets a 1:  the owner of the game is allowed to solve any and all rules disputes by making up his own rules.  I played enough games of this where the owner made up anything he wanted to benefit him while screwing over the other players that I never wanted to play it again (read as one time).  Even before meeting this guy and playing with somebody who tried to follow the rules as written, it was pretty crappy.

I've played RPG for several years, still like the odd fantasy adventure game (Like HeroQuest or Runebound) and I can even appreciate the kind of humour found in Munchkin. But alas, the jokes in Munchkin are funny only once, after which the dreadful gameplay, which seems to never end, starts to demand its toll. At 15 minutes, Munchkin would be a nice but silly diversion. At an hour, which it usually takes, it becomes the source of anger and annoyance.

RATING: 3
I played this a lot when I was a teenager, but now that I'm a grown-up (mostly), it just doesn't do it for me anymore. The need to constantly keep track of your level and bonuses becomes a headache, especially because there's so much wild unpredictability elsewhere in the game.

I think Munchkin stopped being fun around the same time that "random" stopped being the pinnacle of humor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This game is the same every time.  Stop each other from winning, rather than actually trying to win.  There's literally no way to strategize; you just have to deal with what you're given the entire game.  I don't even know why I still own this.

As much as I don't like Munchkin anymore, it's largely because it has overstayed its welcome, as opposed to me not liking the luck-driven card system.

It is fun to start but goes on too long. The rules are easily abused and make it not fun. It's fun before people hit level 9 or 15 minutes, whichever happens first.

RATING: 5
[SJ games 01 edition] {Beer&Pretzels, fantasy adventure; sabotaging; optimal 4-6p} Munchkin is humorous fantasy game. Good for players who like D&D or RPG but it's sad that I don't have many friends who like role-play adventure game. It's highly chaotic. 

The rules are clearly not thoroughly tested and written. I am not sure if Steve Jackson intentionally does it fun. The rules intend to and do involve many player interactions by the back-stabbing and helping. However, players tend to be very nasty and chaotic. The 'take that' element is strong. The game, thus, can last long. (the expansion cards somehow reduce this problem with more useful cards.)

Munchkin has heavy English barrier, it's not suitable for friends who don't like reading.

The graphics of the cards are funny and classic and they suit the game well.  However, it's unforgivable that the game does not provide necessary markers for the level and only comes with an ugly dice with such a price.

[Expansions] The expansion sets increase the replayability and humour. However, I don't like Munchkin Blender. If you don't like Munchkin, don't waste money buying the expansion cards as they indeed are expensive. I would not buy them if there was not a mega sale in a local game store.

It was really fun and exciting for the first five games or so but after that I knew all the cards and the jokes and there wasn't much left in the game.

From all the reviews I've read I expected so much better.  This game was boring and after 2 plays it didn't get any better.  Also, if you are going to charge me $20 for a card game at least include all the pieces!  Giving me a big box with just cards in it and then requiring you to add your own counter pieces made me feel fleeced.

Typically reserved for when we have a bunch of players and want to avoid having to hash through / teach rules. Generally the gaming group enjoys the randomness and screw over ability of the game though it does tend to run too long for what it is. Have tried playing with a number of expansion and have personally found it's best to stick with just one expansion at a time

RATING: 6.5
It's a decent enough game, you just have to not get burned out by it, but that's the same for any game. Also needs the right group - definitely not for those who like to figure out the optimal play, develop strategies and so on. Ideal for folk who will act it up a bit and don't really care who wins: the game is in the messing with other players and the silliness in the cards. On the downside, the endless versions and expansions that are (let's face it) churned out really devalue the game's currency.

RATING: 3
The first time you play Munchkin you'll probably enjoy it and give it an 8 because of the humour on the cards. Maybe the second time as well has you see cards new to you. But after that it loses it's fun factor and becomes a real pain to play. You sit there with little to do on your turn (no planning ahead is required and you can only interact occasionally in some one else's turn) When it's your turn you see what the card is you turn over and if you can do something great but if not, oh well only another 2-3 minutes till your turn again. (or much more with slow players or if you are playing with 6 or more players)

Some of my fondest memories of playing a card game were produced via Munchkin. I love the humor the game has to offer and games can get really fun when people are close to winning and everyone is trying to screw one another. However, the learning curve is very steep and that has unfortunately driven people away from playing it a second time.

It's a great game the first few times you play it with a group of friends who have all played old-school roleplaying games together.

Once you've played it a few times it gets dull.

If you've never played old-school roleplaying games, you won't get the jokes and it will be dull.

Really not bad, just not great either.

Casual 2-6 player party card game version of a dungeon crawler (D&D style adventure). Nice art with plenty of humour on the cards which brings the silliness of this game to life. 

Sadly the mechanics do not work very well, with 3 downsides: 1) there are not enough monsters in the deck (probably as an incentive to buy some of the many expansions) and its unlikely to draw ones appropriate to your level; 2) games can go on for far too long (hours); and 3) it is far too luck based, with repeated misfortune being frustrating.

Simple little beer and pretzels game - one of those where you shouldn't worry too much about the rules. Shouldn't be played too often, or it may get stale - the expansion packs help keep it fresh, though. Especially fun for old D&D'ers, but I've found that even "normal" people can enjoy the jokes in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Things I like:

-Art. There is some fun derived from the comic style art, which is sneering at the fantasy genre. Some people might find this extremely entertaining, for me its funny the first time I see the card.

-Looting. Drawing loot cards is the most fun in the game.
You're getting reward cards that might be strong (which usually still helps next to nothing for your victory though).

Things I don't like:

-No variety. Basically the same cards are repeated (with different art though) over and over. There are not many actually different card types in this game. Keeps the game dead simple though.

-No strategy/tactic possible. It's all so random, basically Monopoly-random with more different things to see. There is next to no decision making, except the tiny part which hand cards to keep, if you should get multiple cards to stop someone from winning, which leads to this game's biggest flaw

-Stupid winning rule. A player wins when reaching level 10. Someone is level 1-8 when fighting a monster? Nobody cares, let him win the fight. Level 9? Bash him/her down with one of those overpowered "+10 for a monster", "put a second monster in the fight", etc cards. The worst thing is the fighting player is bashed by all others. After dropping some levels or losing some gear, this begins all over again. Drags on until someone is lucky enough that the other players can't bash him down enough (remember, no strategy/tactic involved here, it's draw luck) and is able to win the final fight.

I had to reread the rulebook but that's actually how it's supposed to be played. Don't know what the game designers thought when playtesting this. If those negative points don't bother you and you want to spend 60-180 minutes with this, get it. For anyone who's a bit into boardgames and not drunk, you should keep your hands off.

RATING: 4
Humorous cards.  Flip a card.  If you're lucky you win or get free stuff.  If you're not lucky ask for help or maybe just die.  Keep playing until everyone exhausts their bad stuff then someone wins. There's more 'take that' and randomness than I like in my games.  Very social game. 2006/12/08

RATING: 5
The game is hilarious for the first few games but once you know all the cards it can get quite boring. Looking at people playing the game for the first time is a blast too, though. If you want to have the game exciting for yourself too, prepare to buy lots and lots of add-ons (because there are lots and lots of 'em!).

this is a very light playable game, with some major issues.  the cards and the artwork are funny, it is fun building your character, slaying monsters and screwing over the other guy at the crucial moment but the game has some major flaws.  notably, you shouldn't play with more than five, even that is pushing it, it will seem like forever before it is your turn.  Also if you fall behind without using revised rules, it is nearly impossible sometimes to come back, which shouldn't be the case for a light card game.  But it is simple playable and not too heady.  Basically draw a card, use your carad and do what each card says.  Fun, but flawed.

Fairly reading intensive card game with so much fun involved.  Might get slightly old once you are familiar with all the cards, but that would probably take a while.

Haven't played this many times, so the humour value may wear off sooner rather than later. It's a luck-based disaster: There is nothing to stop you from drawing level 15 mosters on your first turn, nor to stop you coasting to an easy victory by drawing chains of level 1 monsters. Some way to scale monsters between levels would be great.

That, and some way to keep track of levels. 

The cards you get are a mess - invarably, somebody will be stuck with weak/useless cards, while another player gets lucky with their cards and wins. This is obviously the case to a lesser degree with a lot of card games, but it's prominent in Munchkin.

When I play this I can't help but think how much this is like the players in my roleplaying campaign. . .
Seriously, it's pretty much a beer and pretzels game where the strategy is to screw everyone else over.
My only concern with the game is it can take a while to get the ball rolling to the point that you can fight most monsters. A later reprinting fixes this.

Marking it down a little more because it's over-hyped. It wouldn't be so bad if people would just stop talking about it all the time. If this makes me a gaming hipster than so be it.

This was a good concept, but seriously suffers from card distribution randomness. Too many cards that have little to no impact or that just hurt you too much early game to ever recover. If a single player is a rogue the game advances at a crawl (god forbid 2 or more players are rogue). Expansions just escalate the problems unless you take the time to cut redundant cards.

A mnemonic for roleplayers. If you've done RPGs, Munchkin can be a nice mnemonic for remembering all the times people did really funny stuff. As a game itself, it's not much, but at least it doesn't try to be.

Major rules flaw: the two-point-whatever seconds to play a card--not enforceable, so not a sensible rule. The rule to use is, everyone silently and secretly selects the cards they want to play, then plays them simultaneously. One chance to stop a win, or response, re-response etc.--whichever feels better to your group. Otherwise, you get into endless, "If you'll do this, I'll do that...." Better to just let the game end. Quickly.

I used to like munchkin A LOT, and while I am still willing to play it from time to time, my multiple bad experiences with the game have made me dislike it more and more.  

The big gripes I have with it are:

1) The game can be very stressful when competitive players jump in with arguments starting since the game allows serious messing with your opponents.

2) The game can drag on making 1 worse

3) The game is typically extremely random with the player in first often getting last.

4) The rules aren't always very clear and one of the lacking pieces of the mechanics is that players can wait for others to help out in a shared fight allowing min-max players to sit back and keep cards in their hand.

These are gripes though, they don't mean I hate the game.  I just don't love it as much as I once did.  The art is great, and it can still be really fun with the right people.

Why do people like this game?  It's not so much a game as an amusing concept.  Its just BAD, but yes the cards are fun.  Try teaching this to a non roleplayer and see what kind of reaction it gets, that being said I don't understand how people can play this over and over again.

I cannot express how much I love Munchkin. It's a brilliant game, full of luck and chance and malice between friends. Its easy to pick on the other players in Munchkin but it always (and I mean always) ends up coming back to bite you. Maybe too random for some and not really a game for those who want a mental challenge or to play something skill-based. For me, though, it's just the most fun I think I've ever had with a card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game much maligned by many other BoardGameGeeks, but I think it can be a lot of fun with the right group of friends. It's full of luck and backstabbing, but the mood of the game is so light-hearted and humourous that it is still enjoyable. Unfortunately, the game can run really long with a larger number of players, which the lightness of the game and limited appeal of the RPG-parody theme don't justify, and so you probably won't get a lot of repeat plays.

I really wanted to like this, but it´s all right at best. Most of the time it´s rather boring and most jokes aren´t even funny the first time you see the card - not to mention the second time. Might be great fun if you are a 16 year old Roleplayer - and even then you might have to drink a few beers, before it´s really worth it´s time. If you didn´t get it yet: I am utterly disappointed.

Chaotic, relies on theme and very, very tired humor. One of the writers for [i]Dungeons of Dredmor[/i] remarked that they checked that their jokes could withstand ten, twenty, fifty readings. Stuff that, if it wasn't still funny, was at least not grating. And so it goes that DoD has only released one expansion, with actual mechanical updates, where Munchkin has released what - dozens? - of vaguely different expansions and version, each focused on casting [i]animate dead[/i] because it's obviously too low level for [i]miracle[/i].

Munchkin is slightly redeemed by competent players -- the sort that legitimately play in Munchkin tournaments, if you believe those exist. Then the game can pass for being tactical. But if this is suggested out of the blue by your average gamer it's usually a sign that you're going to have a very annoying time in the near future. (Hint: The original rulebook explicitly condoned cheating, and enough of the fanbase took this seriously enough that subsequent printings had to go out of their way to explicitly retract that rule. [b]Illuminati[/b] shares this trait. I guess that's just what being hip looked like in the 90's.)

Many describe Munchkin as a fifteen-minute filler game that somehow crams itself into two hours, and I'm inclined to agree.

Love it under some circumstances (esp. with the right people).  Bored to death with a second game in a row.  NEVER EVER play this twice in a row, but once I do enjoy.  The juvenile humor is fantastic.  My wife hates it :(  This one is really hard to rate.  If I haven't played it in a month, the right group makes this an 8.  If I just finished that 8 game, the next one will be a 2.  It has long-range replay value, but 0 short-term.

This is one of my least favorite games ever. It's got some merits: goofy artwork, which some may like; a creative (for its time) and aggressive mechanic; can be played with many players, and some people really like it. I don't care much for the gang up on whoever is winning, and it becomes pretty difficult to win (mostly too long) if the cards aren't right or there are too many people. For me, the beginning is fun, but the game bogs down too much due to the lack of clarity in the rules, and basically being able to house rule many aspects of the cards. But that is just me, I have friends who really enjoy playing

This is just an awful game that got popular because people think they are "backstabbing" their friends.  Sounds cool, except it is just about building and breaking alliances as the game progresses, which is natural in most competitive games. So that is one attraction out of the way. You can get the same experience through Monopoly deal and Uno, which are sadly both better structured games than this is. Munchkin has no fixed rules. You spend time reading and deciphering the text, and arguing over it. You could and should cheat in this game, and that for me is a deal breaker. If a game cannot have discernable rules and requires a third party (in this case the owner of the game) to decide who gets their way or how something should be implemented, then you are better off just arm wrestling to 10 victory points. The artwork is great of course, which is the only reason I can think of for its popularity.

RATING: 6
A humorous take on the silly bits of fantasy roleplaying as a card game, and a typical Steve Jackson product - it's fun for a while until you've seen all the jokes at least once, but mechanics-wise it's very light, and a bit confused too - and, worst of all, it can take forever. 6 as a game, 9 as a piss-take on RPGing (and I did my fair share of that in my time, so this is an educated opinion).

Played twice. With 4 players at maximum, and with the promise of a quick play, it can be fun. However, games lasting an hour are not fun, with everyone standing on Level 9 just waiting to get to Level 10. Funny thing, I was whining about this and threatening to forfeit. Then next turn, someone pulled "Divine Intervention." I was playing a Cleric, and so I won! It was a hilarious ending, but I still would just as soon not play again.

This game has more luck than a leprechaun on St. Patrick's day.  For someone who likes strategy games, this is too random for my liking.  Ya, the cards are kinda funny the first time you play, but aren't funny at all anytime after that.  No wonder there are 2,000 different expansions for this game; the cards get old fast.  The gameplay is so broken, basically, someone gets close to winning, and everyone teams up to bring them down, and the game keeps dragging on and on until someone gets lucky enough to win.  It's a game that should take 30 minutes and can take 3 hours.  Now, you might say "Well, it's funny to screw people over and it's a light party game, not meant to have a lot of strategy and not to be taken too seriously".  But, there are 1,000 better party games that are more entertaining, more fun, and take less time than this game.  There is no niche that this game fits into well.  It seems like this is the game that people own who have only played American games (like Monopoly or Risk) and think they are special for owning it, and have no idea of the better games out there.  Awful game, and have no desire to play this again.

Games are supposed to be fun. I always have fun playing Munchkin, trying to slay monsters, and be as nasty as possible to other players.

Besides all I said... an update to say that it started to be harder to get my group to play munchkin. And I eventually started to think Munchkin is "not game enough" for a game so long (at least at times).

Sold it to someone who'll play way more than I was playing lately.

I hate choosing a 1 for a game so many of my friends love, but it's true that I wouldn't be caught dead playing this again.  I've even given it several tries.
The artwork is funny, the items are funny, I do like the idea of mixing 'space' and 'cowboys' for Space Cowboys.

The problem lies with the actual game.  You spend the first 45-60 mins getting to level 9 (level 10 wins), then you spend the next 60+ mins attempting to just beat 1 monster.  The game becomes "Ok, I'll defeat this monster.  Oh, Jim just made him harder, ok, I'll play this card to get stronger.  Oh, now Bob played a card to make him harder, ok I'll play this card I've been saving to get stronger and beat him.  Oh, now Ashley is playing a card to make the monster stronger and now I've lost.  Well that was dumb.  Ok now it's Jim's turn, oh we all played cards to make him not win so now it's Bob's turn." REPEAT.

The winner is whoever is after the player that go so close to winning that everyone spent their 'take that' cards and now don't have any to stop you.  That's it, just whoever goes AFTER the guy who almost won.  They don't have anything to stop the next player and he wins.  Such a waste of time.  It's the first time in my life I walked away from a game (90 mins in an we had all been at level 9 for 2/3 of the game).

I'd rather play Monopoly, in fact, I'd rather do anything else before this, including calling it a night.

When I was introduced to this game, by a friend who had more expansions than I can remember, those first few games we played were AMAZING!!

But then since finally finding it again, the games I've played since just haven't been nearly as good ... even after adding the Zombies expansion. :-(

I think I lose more and more interest in this game with each replay. It's a fanstastic idea (as most Steve Jackson games are) but is overly complex in all the various interactions and combination modifiers (as is the case in many Steve Jackson games). Still, the theme and humor have been enough to keep me wanting to play.

Silly fun, this is RPG lite with a comedy twist which really polarizes peoples opinions of it. Enjoying my first few plays very much.
Update - After more plays I find myself liking this less. The lack of some basic rule structure that for me is intuitive and should be there actually hurts this game. A lot of people enjoy Munchkin for its lack of rules and the cheating that ensues but for me it just isn't right.

This game is loads of fun, and simple to teach.   

If you've ever played dungeon and dragons, or any similar type of game, you can really appreciate the humor of this game.   The art in this game is hilarious, and the play on words just keeps you wanting to draw more cards.   I own pretty much all the expansions, and this game is the single reason I was able to get my wife into boardgaming.

If you're looking to have fun with a bunch of friends over beer with light conversation, this is the game for you.  If you're looking for strategy, and skill based challenge?  Look somewhere else :)

One of the most devisive games on the planet.  You love or hate.  Games usually turn into an arms race, with folks picking on the leader and someone else sneaking the victory -- but that doesn't mean that's not fun.  Great time is had, people laugh at the dumb jokes.  It's fun.  Deal with it, high-concept gamers.

I don't mind luck in games, there is something else about Munchkin.
I will not refuse to play, but it is guaranteed that I won't enjoy it unless it ends very close. This happens so infrequently because it depends on too many factors (player characters not being over/under-powered, encountering monsters that are beatable, even distribution of "take that!" cards, etc.)
I find Munchkin unbearable/depressing at its worst, and when close it still comes down to "take that!" cards, which is not really fun.

Plenty of games of Munchkin have left me unable to level up towards victory because I don't draw enough creatures, beatable or not. But I have also won plenty of games that just weren't fun. I remember one game where I climbed levels over two or three rounds, then immediately won by selling off all my cards. Even the card played to drop me down a level couldn't stop my victory. Never have I felt more like I've wasted people's time with a board game.

Needs refinement to ensure more reliable gameplay.

RATING: 4
One of the first games (along with Pandemic and Catan) that got me started in this hobby two years ago.  I like Munchkin for what it is - a goofy fun time.  The game is otherwise very limited in decisions and really random.  It also encourages the "gang up on the player who is currently in first" ideology which I despise.  This cheapens the game and makes it seem pretty random who ends up winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I give this game that high of a rating because for as much flak as it takes on this site I always have people in my gaming group asking me to break it out.  I enjoy playing it, we as a group enjoy playing it.  Munchkin is silly, and easy, and a good source of inside jokes.  I think those are all hallmarks of a good game.

I played this several times while on camping holiday with a group of friends every year between about 2005 and 2012. The whole group consisted of video game geeks, so there was some affinity to board games, but it needed to be an easy one. Since we stopped these camping holidays I didn't hit the table again. Munchkin is fun early on, and we definitely had our laughs when a level 9 guy lost against a pimped goldfish something like 46 to 42, but it definitely drags for too long to be a good casual.

Unlike most board game fans, I am fine with Munchkin. It is a good game, but only if the players are in the right mood or mind set. The game only really breaks down when players are trying to win. If a group is going into the game with a goal of hurting each other as much as possible instead of trying to be the winner, the game can be funny.

Having said that, the humor on the cards is light-hearted, it is not side splittingly funny.

My opinion after one play, it was much as I expected: a very simple and abstracted dungeon delve, with lots of player interaction, mainly of the "take that!" variety, though there can be cooperative play for mutual benefit, but only up to a point, since everyone is racing to be the first to level 10.  The biggest draw is the comedic art and text on the cards, which along with the screw you factor means this game would be a blast with the right group.  This is very light and strongly luck based, but played quickly so didn't outstay its welcome.

RATING: 4
[b]Munchkin[/b] has jokes that don't resist many plays. The gameplay is lackluster, prone to luck. There is a good deal of take-that elements that can lead to some funny moments, but also frustration after sucessive failures to do basically anything. The biggest sin of the game is the lack of playtime control, so a game that shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes (at the most) to end, can take 120 minutes or more.

The artwork, by [b]John Kovalic[/b], is the best part of [b]Munchkin[/b]. But, save yourself some time and go see the [b]Dork Tower[/b] comics.

The 4 rating reflects the artwork and the games that end up in less than 40 minutes - these ones are berable and the theme/humor can keep me interested for that long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Honestly not as bad a game as people make it out to be. But in my experiences the game was broken at 5-6 players. Where the game would never end at the final level because whoever was 1 monster away from winning would be interrupted and this would repeat until either a random person won or the discard pile got shuffled and the process got repeated.

This game would be alright if it didn't drag on so much.  What always happens is one player gets close to winning, so everyone uses all their cards to power up the next monster he fights so that the player loses a bunch of stuff and the game has to continue.  I see where the mass appeal comes from because the humor is strong and the art is cute, but as far as gameplay goes, I'm not a fan.

So far, I played munchkin twice and did not like it at all, yet.  While I always give a game a few tries just to see, I am not sure I will play this one ever again.  I loved illuminati so I had high expectations maybe.  Compared to all the other games I have, this would be in probably the lowest position.  After playing another time, my wife likes it a little bit more as she learned how to play better.  While it is still not a great game, my opinion has increased a little bit.  My initial rating was a 3 and I will at least now move it to a 5, which is just ehh.  Not as horrible as I originally thought, but not great either.  UPDDATE!  We have played more of this game, and it has again lost much luster fast with the whole gaming group.  We are just not fans of gaining up on the winner type games.  Not only that, but the game is just a dud.  Try illuminati, much, much better.

I rate Munchkin fairly high, because it's a great game when played with the right group. I have very good memories of games with people cursing and laughing around the table. It has delivered much better experiences than its mechanics would suggest. However, it is too simple and random to be a game I would play repeatedly. All the games also tend to play out similarly, with everyone playing negative cards on the leader, leaving the second or third player to win.

I used to play this all the time around 2001-2003; we used to get many laughs out of all of the writing and illustrations.  I still enjoy this a lot, every once in a while, especially with people who have never played.

The instructions, although hilarious, are a little too wordy and disorganized.

An angel cries every time someone suggests you play munchkin instead of a real game.

The co-operation/negotiation involved in fighting is the only thing that appealed to me even a little bit.  If I want to laugh at the cards, I'll sit down and go through the cards, not play a lame game built around them

An ok light strategy game for new gamers who have a video game or roleplaying background.

This game. 
It's like Mario Party without the mini games. You just press A until bowser comes out and gives the bonus star to Luigi for no conceivable reason. 

It's simply not for me. 

The artwork is so offensively poor I wish I could unsee it. The quality of components is about the equivalent of the packaging you discard after buying a real game. 

I hate it. It is pointless but not benign. It's actually a waste of time and that is not a matter of taste in games. This is a literal commentary on the morality of doing nothing. This game makes me feel like I'm going backwards.

Everytime I hear someone say it's name with joy or curiosity I can hear the flap of black wings in my heart as the Dark Crow of Mourning comes to rest upon my fears and squeeze them tight. 
I feel like this game makes it harder for me to introduce people to the hobby because of how underwhelming and unsatisfying it is. You can have fun playing it. Once. If you seriously have nothing better to do and very open mind.

The term Gateway can be thrown around to try and help justify it's market presence and accessibility but I believe there has to be a better way of getting our hobby to the wider world. There are better games that can introduce people to the hobby.

This game is unwelcome in my collection and will never again seize my time and stuff vast amounts of it down the drain of life. 

But hey.  If you play it and it works for you, hooray. I don't mind that it does good for the hobby, I just mind that it does bad too.

Fun to play with your buddies, overpriced card game. Game is oriented around negative interaction, and your so-called friends, will always try to screw you up. It's not really complicated, however, rule book is written terrible, and it makes you feel like this game is really complicated. No, it's not, really.

Game itself is not challenging. It's about screwing everyone and everything up. If you like this kind of negative interaction, then you might like this game. But for me, this game is medicore at best.

I could never imagine playing Munchkin ever again. Worst game ever along side Monopoly.

Munchkin is what it claims to be, a *dumbed-down* version of D&D.  This means it provides some nostalgia and a D&D *fix* but even that wears off fast.  For those that never played D&D (like my wife), Munchkin has no value.  Sadly, the *beat-down the leader* mechanics actually reduces the enjoyment in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
With the right people it can be hilariously fun, but then you need to be at least four at the table, preferably more. The pure game mechanics are crap, but the game is more about player interaction than anything else.

Once I played as a level eight cleric, and managed to draw divine intervention two times in a row (using the power of the cleric the second time) and thereby winning the game.

Not entirely so horrible as it's made out to be. It's actually a pretty good distillation of the D&D kill-a-monster-take-it's-treasure formula into a simple card game. The negotiation aspect is actually pretty good. It really should be shorter, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
When Munchkin first hit the people I game with, we had fun.  Then it became the game we had to play every time.  Then came 5,000 expansions, each one making the game longer and harder to win (Super Munchkin being the worst of this) and people often wanting to mix them up.  This is probably my second favorite, and the one I'd play if asked, but only very rarely.  Games where you have to try hard not to be winning are not a game I want to play anymore.

Of the SJG this is the Quintessential game that lasts longer than it is fun.  The problem really comes from the fact that another  another player may eventually decide I am just tired of playing this game and let the other player win.  The other ending is when no one has had enough cards to stop the player.  Still I bought expansions.  Must be the masochism in me.

Might be ok with the right group. The game design leads to runaway players/left behind players, so if the group is fluid enough to counteract that it might be ok.

A great comedic and thematic success, but gameplay is less than inspired.

The Cult of Munchkin is an odd thing: the first time you play, it's kind of fun. Whimsical, even. 

After a few plays, however, the honeymoon is over. There is no semblance of balance or strategy in this game- you can sandbag and/or bluff, but that's about it.

Being entirely luck-based wouldn't be that terrible, were it not for the fact that it can take 3 hours to finish if playing with 4 or more players. Expansions only add to the misery. How can a supposed "beer & pretzels" game drag on that long?

The best part of the game is the nomenclature of the cards, followed by the accompanying artwork. If the game itself were as good as these, it would be fun to play.

Pros: highly thematic, fun art, moderate level of player interaction, very humorous

Cons: prone to bash-the-leader, high randomness, high degree of luck involved, can overstay its welcome due to lengthy playtime

I enjoy this game when I'm in the mood for something fun & lighthearted.  I enjoy the theme a lot. That being said, there are two big problems with it that keeps it from reaching the table often: the game length and the incessant dog-piling on the leader at the end of the game.

It's beyond belief that this trash has somehow accumulated a cult following. I had always thought this game was very old; from the 80's at least. This was a comforting thought, because this was the reason I told myself it had fans. It was from an era before civilization had figured out some modicum of game design.

However, this game is from 2001. That's still pretty early when thinking about modern boardgaming, but consider the fact Puerto Rico came out the year after this.

I had a point there but I'm having trouble formulating thoughts when realizing that this game isn't even from the 90's and it's literally worse than every other board game we all love to shun. Battleship is better. Clue is better. MONOPOLY is better.

Where do I even begin with this? Firstly, the outcome is completely random. Players may argue that it has social aspects akin to Catan, but it doesn't matter. There is no strategy. There is no gameplay.

You'd think a game based on pure randomness with no gameplay would be simple to explain, right? I mean, everyone knows Rock Paper Scissors. But somehow this cretinous game not only completely fails to explain any rules, but it actually relishes in doing so. It even deliberately fails to explain "who goes first", the very first segment of the rulebook. Every single turn made results in an argument about rules, which is pointless because none of it matters. Someone could win with their opening hand. Someone could be given no cards to allow them to win during the duration of the game. Someone could be given all the cards to win in a single turn, in an ultimate example of kingmaking. The game promotes "stabbing your friends", but there's often situation where you aren't even allowed to do that. Or you might be, but the rules aren't clearly explained, so who knows?

The only way this game's existence makes sense is as a giant troll attempt. If Steve Jackson had made a bet that he could make the world's worst card/board game and make it profitable, then congratulations sir, you have done it. 10/10, successful troll is successful.

A game I very much regret wasting money on.  I got a "McGinty Guest Artist Edition" which is technically a deluxe since it came with a board.  I think the good stops at the guest art and board.

I really couldn't wait for the game to be done.  It felt very stupid and pointless.  It's all luck.  You draw cards, draw more cards, and draw more cards.  If you're lucky, you'll level up and move up the path.  If not, you might lose your gear or get knocked back down a level.

This game sounded good and it was recommended by many people so I had to try it.  Boyfriend didn't hate it as much as I did, but I have no desire to play again.  It seems like it would be better used as a party game - with a larger group of people (probably involving alcohol), but is not a game for the 2 of us or even our families.

I have played this game a few times now, and that's enough for me. The humour probably makes each version worth playing once or twice, but there's an incredible amount of chaos. Being a (former) roleplayer heavily into fantasy themes, I get all the jokes, but this game would be painful for people who aren't.

If you die, you start back at 1 with no stuff, which is incredibly annoying - even when it happens to others, since if they win the game would end! If this game took 30-40 minutes, it would be a nice filler, but unfortunately, a game can take anywhere from 30m-2hr. By the end of a long game you wish there was player elimination so you can go watch TV instead. It doesn't help that the game is also quite expensive for the quality of the components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As a light filler I'd rate this a 5 normally, but this game has the potential to swallow up your time to play other boardgames. The only time I play this is when it's the only game open. Then it far outstays its welcome and you lose an hour you could be playing something decent.

I like this game.  It was the first of the Munchkin games that I played, but I found it confusing because I had never role-played.  Particularly understanding the race vs. class drove me nuts.

A good starting point for the Munchkin enthusiast, but one will get more mileage from the game board that is included with the Level Playing Field pack as it has standard and Epic Munchkin paths as opposed to the standard-only board in Deluxe. I have removed and replaced the cardboard box insert with wooden card deck / discard holders and a tray to hold the manuals and munchkin figures. All currently owned expansions fit in the box with the main game and both game boards and a full set of male and female character figures.

I want to like this game.  I really do but I don't.  It's one of those random event type games with off the cuff text.  The goal is to get to a level 10 by selling equipment and defeating monsters, etc.  Other players can help you for a cut of the winnings or hurt you with event cards.  It's a nice random kind of game with a fluxxy feel but there's too much card text and it easily gets bogged down.  It's probably more fun the more you play it but I'll never know that for sure.

I've played it only once, but in what I have to figure would be the optimal conditions: a group of nerds, all of whom are familiar with D&D and its related tropes, and with plenty of alcohol to make the silliness and take-that of the game more palatable.  And even given the ideal situation, it was downright AWFUL.  Several players had to discard their hands and lose their items early on, due to the vagaries of fate.  This meant they were essentially eliminated about 5 minutes into an hour plus game.  Then, toward the end, it became entirely about pile on the leader to keep him from getting to level 10.  Sure, the cards and the screwage are funny, but that doesn't excuse this game's glaring flaws.

Silly card game that has a lot of inside jokes regarding role playing games (D&D, warcraft, etc). It's fun, but people who aren't into RPGs may not "get" it.

RATING: 1
Game started rocky, played okay for a couple of rounds and then overstayed its welcome by about an hour and half.  Nothing really happens in the first 1-2 rounds, then a couple of people seem to be able to get lucky and advance.  Then it just devolves into making sure they do not win.  Eventually we just stopped trying to slow down the leaders to end the game.

Would be higher if not for the "screw you" dilemma caused by one player about to win, and multiple people with the ability to stop him, and noone who wants to use it. (since it would weaken their own position)

This game is filled of diplomatic tricks. 
But it has unreasonable amount of randomness! So it freezes me out if I'm loosing and if I'm winning. 
P.S. I previously owned Star Munchkin but this time is gone and I'm happy.

It's fun but only the first times (and only if you know RPGs, especially D&D). 
Replay value is close to zero.

Steve Jackson örök érvényű játéka, a fantasy-player sötét oldalára játszik rá: bármi is jön szembe le kell kaszabolni, elvenni a kincsét és már eközben keresni a következő kaszabolni valót. Az, hogy OP (over-powered) legyél nem hiba, hanem életcél, amihez harmadik kezet szerzel a két fejed mellé, és ha kell hátbadöföd a társaidat is, csak, hogy Te legyél legelőbb 10-es szintű.

I have played one game, where the others had played this quite a lot. They said that the game is easy, fast and fun and didn't even bothered to explain me the rules nor show the different types of cards. Of course, if you are familiar with something, it is easy to you, but for a newbie it most likely is not. I learned quite a lot during the game of course, but the overall feeling was not that good. Second time with better preparation might be better, but I still think that this game is not my favorite genre. Not much to do, lots of player interaction and the game just lasts and lasts...

Update after second play, no, the game is not for me. It is "funny", but not enough, and the end game is just too long.

Updated after two more plays. Still way too long (although we had too many players as well), but now I managed to understand the rules and develop some tactics (I won both plays). We used Star Munchkin and Cthulhu Munchkin expansions. Updated the rating from 4 to 5. I don't think I will play this game anymore, if there is more than 5 players...

Another play, with 7 this time. Over two and half hour with just the base game. It had some fun moments, but it is just so long...

Rating after one play.

Well, what can I say?... Not so bad as some claim, not so good as others say. My one playing of this was with only three players and it was quite fast, we didn't play for more than 45 minutes. And even though I'm not into b{[b]D&D[/b]}b that this satirizes, I still found it funny.

I wouldn't request it, nor plan a games night around it, but it's certainly not as bad as the comments here on the geek made me fear.

I would love to go through the deck to read all the jokes. I laughed out loud when I turned the "Tequila Mockingbird" card. Oh boy! It's so good that it hurts!

This is a very fun game.  Basically it is an RPG using cards with a high degree of "stick it to ya!" for everyone playing.  It is easy to explain and quick to play.  One of my favorites when the gang needs something quick and light weight.  The game is really about just having fun with a fairly high silliness factor.  If you are looking for a deep strategic game experience, this is not your game.  But if you would like to find a game that you can play quickly and just blow off steam with some buds, this one is worth giving it a spin.

This was supposed to be a fun game: comical joke, even the round phases are whacky. And the artwork fits the game amazingly.

With the right cards in hand, this game feels amazing. The problem is it often doesnt work. And sometimes the game just drags on indefinitely when it is about to end. This game doesnt work well on my regular group, so this game is leaving my collection.

I've played the original game half a dozen times but feel it is not one I'll choose to play regular;y as it does lend itself to 'runaway victories' unless everyone chips in to prevent the purchasing of levels and retrieving add level cards from the discard pile. The game art is very atmospheric, and to be fair, it is a game that for all the skull-duggery, is very tongue in cheek as players try to play beneficial cards for themselves. These may be racial and class types or item related ones that give bonuses. The threshold level seems to be about seven levels when the 'tit-for-tat' wandering monsters kick in. Like many games of this kind, every player should be looking to prevent a runaway leader which may mean keeping hold of level bonus cards until later on. I think it plays well as an occasional game but does drag on sometimes so I think an egg timer would make it run a lot quicker and make it more manic which i think is what the designer wanted.

Munchkin is a stand-alone card game designed by Steve Jackson that "simulates" (well, sorta') a fantasy-themed RPG (oh, ok, DnD) in a simple, card-based game that's chock full o' silliness. Everyone begins the game as a 1st level Human with NO Class (heh-heh) and via cards, they acquire Races (Elf, Dwarf, etc.), Classes (Thief, Wizard, Cleric, etc.), Items, Armor, Potions and more that they use to combat hideous monsters like the 4th level Undead Horse, the 10th level Net Troll and the 14th Level Unspeakably Awful, Indescribable Horror (very nasty, indeed). The object of the game is to reach Level 10 and levels are acquired via the slaying of monsters and the selling of acquired treasure (1,000 Gold Pieces equals 1 Level). Very silly and a lot of fun!

Has a special place in my heart (There is history with this game...like many others), but poorly designed expansions that are really incompatible with the others, make the deck so thin to get the right equipment, too random. Needs a redesign to balance out (i.e. different decks for different levels...). Been toying in my head how to tweak game to have it more of a game, not rounds of snickering luck (The laughing stopped after seeing all the cards...i.e. the unboxing).

This game gets a lot of grief among those who consider themselves more hardcore but it has a place. It is fun, social and quite easy to get to the table with non-gamers.

Update:I have actually dropped the score for this again. It can be fun but seeing a friend group playing it again I was reminded that it can be good fun at first but feels a little stale after the joke/novelty wears off (I'm sure that is why there are so many expansions to keep it fresh). Also very text heavy which means reading everyone's cards for new players and a little more difficulty with multicultural groups.

After numerous play-throughs, This is a great set of jokes and a horrible game. Each game essentially devolves into holding all of your actually good cards (the ones that basically say "you can't win this fight") until someone who's level 9 is about to go out, and then playing one. You repeat this until everyone is out of delay-the-game cards and someone randomly wins. It sucks.

But it's even worse than that. When someone is about to go out, you don't want to use the card to prevent them from winning - you want someone ELSE to use a card so that they can't use it on you in the future. The result is a slow-ass waiting game where people stare at their cards, hemming and hawing, until someone finally gets bored and prevents the poor sod from winning.

This is also another in the long line of "player who pulls ahead first can't ever win" games. The person who tries to go out first inevitably gets the pants rocked off of them.

One variant I've been tooling around with in my head is to allow people to go out with the "level up" cards. This would in theory fix the horrible waiting time at the end, and encourage people to use their cards early on leaders rather than much later. I haven't had a chance to try it, though.

I usually enjoy the first play of a Munchkin game. The silly card combos and inside jokes make suffering through the tedious gameplay bearable. I can't honestly say that there is technically anything wrong with the way the series plays...I just have a personal dislike for adventure games that rely upon opposing players to disrupt fights and pump up the bad guys in order to provide the challenge. I don't like it in Runebound or A Touch of Evil and I really loathe it here. Not only is it frustrating to never know what you need to actually win, it usually makes any game that utilizes this mechanic last far beyond its welcome. Again, I completely understand Munchkin's popularity. It's an entire deck of RPG geek culture references. It's just that as a game, I find it really boring (especially after the jokes run out...) and far too long.

I started out enjoying this one, but it only took me four plays to reach my burnout point. Munchkin is a VERY long game that is at least 90% luck. If you get dealt a bad starting hand? Tough luck. If you constantly draw random cards that don't help you? Tough luck. 

Games with 5-6 players can easily go to the four hour mark. In the late phase of the game it becomes a complete stalemate with everyone playing cards that prevent each other from finishing the game. I actually sabotaged my last game and helped another player win just to prevent us from going into a fifth hour of Munchkin. Never again.

Munchkin can be fairly amusing, in that its a great satire of role playing games and gaming in general. The problem with the game is that, true to its theme, it encourages everyone to play like a munchkin. There are constant rules disputes, min/maxing, and pound on the leader problems, meaning that the game can drag on and on and *on*! After one 3.5 hour long session, I decided not to play it anymore. It's a lot of fun to listen to other people playing, though. :)

As a game that doesn't take itself seriously, Munchkin succeeds - as long as the players can follow suit. It's very good at being what it intends to be - an opportunity for people to be power hungry and merciless to each other.

The sometimes ambiguous rules combined with the encouragement to argue your stance (no matter how far-fetched they may be), erratic power fluctuations, and obvious or non-existent choices can get old pretty fast, but if you want a game where everyone just slugs it out, Munchkin works.

For a while this was easily a top 10 game for me.  I enjoyed busting down the door fighting the monster, and grabbing the loot.  This game was interesting to me and I love how simple it is to play.  I mean we got to the point we would play this game EVERY chance we got.  It got to the point that I would try to save all of my good cards for level 10.  Why do you ask? Because That's the level everyone pulls out all of their baddies on.  Then after countless times of play I realized... THERE IS ONLY ONE STRATEGY!! EVERYONE saves ALL their good cards till that last level and then its an aftermath into which usually the next person to reach level 10 ends up winning.  Now, I'm not saying this is a bad game, I'm just saying for the amount of times we played it we eventually broke the game.  Which is why I bought an expansion to this game to see if it changes this game up someway.

What a great idea... what a boring game. Could be a fun game if it lasted 3o minutes or less, but it is neither funny enough nor engaging enough to warrant a game over 30 minutes in length. 

It's not that I hate Munchkin, it's just that I hate playing munchkin. I understand it's satire both about bad games and abusive players and it embodies both poor game design and abuses the players. I'd probably love Munchkin if it's play time were appropriate to it's mechanisms.

My thoughts as we were playing this game..."Please let it stop!"

That said, it got MUCH better at the end of the game, but by then we had been playing for THREE HOURS!   This after the same foursome had played Puerto Rico in 1 hour!  The game comes down to luck of the draw and whether or not people are going to slap you down.  Has a terrible bash the leader problem, so you want to run a close 3rd so that the two leaders bash each other and lie exhausted as you sneak in for the win.  There are much better games out there for the payoff.

I particularly enjoy this game, but only with the right people.  The rules are vague on purpose and it is meant to instigate fighting over how to play.  So while I would never try to get my family to play this with me, every time I have played it with friends we have always had a blast.

It's not bad, porobably really good with the right group, but honestly, this is take it or leave it territory for me. It's an action-reaction card game with hand management and negotiation. A lot of it is simply pure luck, but the leaderbashing can be fun to witness/participate in.

Why this is not in the collection anymore: When you start playing board games at some point you may encounter munchkin. Especially if you have roleplayed the idea of munchkin may sound fun. It isn't. Unfortunately you just want to try again and see if a new expansion would make it more fun. They don't.

I've been playing with a friend's set and borrowing it to play with other friends, and every single time someone new is introduced to it, they go buy it as gifts for all their other friends. :D I am a table-top RPG and MtG gamer, and Munchkins scratches both itches at the same time, in a very light-hearted and accessible way. I can play it with people who would never touch D&D or MtG. It's whimsical and doesn't take itself too seriously, but the rules are an elegantly balanced work of art. There isn't much storyline (unless you add it in on your own), but the mechanic is so fun that it feels like there is one.

"Kill the monsters - Steal the treasure - Stab your buddy."

Munchkin is a simple card game that parodies a Dungeons & Dragons RPG. Everyone begins the game as a 1st level Human with NO Class and via cards, they acquire Races (Elf, Dwarf, etc.), Classes (Thief, Wizard, Cleric, etc.), Items, Armor, Potions and more that they use to combat hideous monsters. The object of the game is actually to be the first to reach Level 10 by slaying monsters and selling acquired treasure.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
If Munchkin could just make the game end instead of it dragging on forever once someone hits level 9 I would like it so much more because I like most of the mechanics and the art. But when a game that should be 30 minutes starts to break an hour, it wears on me fast.

Munchkin is tons of fun for the fantasy gamer. Kovalic's illustrations (Dork Tower) are the perfect match for the utterly ridiculous nature of the game itself.

This is a great game, full of valuable life lessons, like "Never pick up a duck in a dungeon, ever." (Remember that one, kids, next time you cross paths with waterfowl in your local dungeon!) Plus, it allows you to learn many useful trades. (Like the rogue, who can backstab any character.) And you can try a variety of races, and change race often. (The dwarf is nice, if you're a packrat who likes to carry extra stuff. Or be an elf, and get rewarded for helping your companions.)

Seriously, it's great fun. And it works best if you have friends who can get into the spirit of the game... "Kill the monsters. Steal the treasure. Stab your buddy."

Though initially fun, replayability is hampered by the relatively unbalanced nature of the cards in the base deck.  Moreover, the endgame very quickly devolves into an archenemy situation, with all other players at the table collaborating to stop the leading player from actually being able to seal a victory.  

A decent party game, better if the novelty of its cheeky puns hasn't yet worn off.

I used to play this game a lot, but as time goes by this game grew a bit stale on me and the kingmaking 'everybody pile on the winner' so that the runner up can win the game is a sad part of this game. 

The card art and naming and themeing is witty and funny at first, but the humor quickly wears of.

Best rule of this game though is that if no-one sees you cheating, than you are not cheating. This can create an interesting dynamic within the group, but can also grow tedious is someone constantly and overtly cheats the whole game through.

Silly game that mimics dungeon-crawls, but only the fighting and the looting of it. A lot of take-that between players as they try to hinder each other in reaching the goal of the game.
But this can make the game go for much to long and the jokes get old really quick.

Hilarious game... once or twice. Mostly a "Screw the leader" dicefest kind of game. If someone starts to win, everyone gangs up on him. As a result, the game-- drags-- too-- long. Playing time 45 minutes? Yeah, right. The two games I played lasted 1.5 to 2.5 hours. The cards are very funny to read through, but not funny enough to mask the broken and un-fun game below it. I rate this about a 3 for a four-player game or more, and about a 6 for a three-player game. It plays much better with fewer players.

Rulebook made zero sense. Game was ridiculous and involved total nonsense. Owner had no idea how to play the game and said there was meant to be a game board and pawns which were non existent. Something went awfully wrong when they pulled this out, because I hated it and was left with a terrible taste in my mouth. The very first paragraph of the rules referred to tokens that were not included in the box. This is probably why I always practice my own games at least once before pulling them out on friends and trying to teach them. Would never play again based on this one bad experience. On my first 3 turns all I did was pull curses. Then on my fourth turn I instantly won the game through level up treasures from beating 1 monster with a chainsaw and some other bonuses and modifiers. Total garbage.

I love the parody-of-dungeon-crawls theme! Sense of humor is a MUST for this one! Yes, the "endgame" can get tedious as someone tries to reach Level 10, but we've had lots of fun leading up to that!
*Update...downgraded to a 6. The novelty is gone, "aided" in part by too many expansions. Loads less fun being had.*
*AND down to 4. I stopped buying this stuff some time back when I realized all we did was read the cards, not actually play the game! Done with this.*

RATING: 8
This is a huge hit with my gaming group.  We all love video games and online RPGs, so we could relate to the cards.  We also love screwing each other over.  The screwing over starts at level 1.  A typical Munchkin game for us takes several hours because everyone is trying to destroy everyone.

A true beer and pretzels game- or perhaps, given the context, Mountain Dew and Cheetos. Munchkin has an underdeveloped system that compensates by throwing ridiculous situations and an ever-increasing supply of customization and new mechanics into the mix (they could compete with M:tG for most new sets released in a given point of time).

If you're looking for a light, relatively quick (20-30 min at double standard life, so about 15 min on average) game, and you can be appreciative to the genre (and the inside jokes the game makes against it) and the vast supply of webcomic artists that contribute to the game (and will fill in blank cards at conventions) then Munchkin is a necessity for your collection.

REALLY LONG for what it is. This game should take maybe 30 minutes, being that it is at heart a card drawing, dice rolling game with no board and no long-term strategy. Instead, it often takes 90 minutes, and can go as long as 3 HOURS. Unfortunately this is the syndrome of every Steve Jackson game I have played. I will refuse to play this game every time it is suggested, as well as any other SJ games. Maybe they should focus more on gameplay and less on 'humor'- or at least what they try to insist is humor.

Munchkin is good just to make a laugh the first time you read a card. The game itself is useless and almost nonexistant. It's just a joke, it's not a real game. Nonetheless it's a good joke, so I'm feeling generous and I'll give it a 5!

Ugh. The pinnacle of "Take-That!" games. Entertaining for about 10 minutes; once a year. Unfortunately, as the game as a great deal of forward and backward scoring, it has the same nausiating feel as Snakes and Ladders over time. Just kill me and get it over with.

Отличная игра для новичков. В правильной компании много фана. Главное не зацикливаться на победе, а наслаждаться игровым процессом. 

Недостаток всех манчкинов - после нескольких игр начинаешь запоминать карты и юмор уже не кажется таким смешным.

Второй минус для меня этого манчкина - фэнтезийная тематика - слишком банально.

This is not a game to play with thin-skinned friends, or people that don't like being dog-piled on.  The humor is good, though after a number of plays you know all the humor, so it's not as funny and you'll likely be buying the expansions to add humor into the game.  Yet, the rules make picking this game up very easy and enjoyable.  For anyone that's ever thought they would like to play a casual RPG game, but didn't want to be bothered with the pen, paper and voluminous rule-books; it's RPG-very-light.

When I first saw Munchkin played at TableTop - Wil Wheaton, I was enamored and said to myself I must have it. And now that I have it. I wished I should have not gotten it at all. It's a good game yes. But there is so much stuff that makes it a tad boring than your normal take that type of game. When I said boring it's because the game overstays it's welcome in a gaming session. The biggest selling point and achilles hill is it's mechanics of being able to pull your opponents down the same way they can pull you down from achieving victory. At first this game is a novelty of negotiation, alliances and betrayal. But this same novelty wears pretty quickly once the game time moves over an hour. All in all this game is good for at least 1-3 plays. Then you can definitely store it somewhere in the darker parts of your shelf.

Great on its own but expansions offer fantastic bonuses. A clever comical send-up of all things D&D with near unlimited potential to be constantly expanded with more monsters and items. Very tactical and interactive despite the sillyness. Will appeal to ANY age group.

CONS; Requires a minimum of 3 players and recommended no more than 6. Player can easily gang up on others (regardless of lvl difference or advantage) meaning best played with people who love free-for-all competition and will not seek to let others win.

Once every year or so we pull out this game and all the expansions that I own and play a very Munchkinly game of Munchkin (although see below). The build-up and humor are the best parts of this game so if it feels like the endgame is about to start dragging I don't worry too much about winning (I'll give it one good shot, at least). I also don't recommend mixing all the cards from all the different expansions. It dilutes the themes and makes it near impossible to ever build a decent "Laser" gun.

I've heard complaints about this game, but I really love it. The cards have a lot of humor in the names and illustrations, and the game play is very light hearted and full of betrayal. Still, this is a game that, more than most, depends on the group you play it with. It is not a very strategic game. Rather it is purely a negotiation game where you are playing the people more than the game.

If you play with a group that has problems with betraying people and stabbing them in the back, then this is not the game for you. Everyone at the table has to realize that nobody is their friend and have fun with that, otherwise the experience can be ruined.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Munchkin isn't *great*, but it is lightweight and easy to play with casual players. Unless I am with serious gamer friends, this is easier to get on the table than most. I do prefer different versions; people who are willing to play the mock-D&D version are willing to play something closer to D&D, less fluffy.

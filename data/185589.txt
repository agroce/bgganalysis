I am torn between 5 and 6. There are some minor things that annoy me a bit but I reckon they would not keep me from playing.

The whole game of Islebound is about sticking to one strategy and timing your actions correctly, or should I say taking your actions in the correct order. You want to take the biggest possible leaps forward by utilising all actions to the fullest. Since the game end can be triggered quite suddenly there is practically no time for sidestepping. In other words it is a race, a rather unforgiving race I would say. 

Perhaps my only bigger complaint is about the abrupt game end (akin to Manhattan Project). For the major part of the game no one is even remotely close to triggering the game end condition. Then on one turn a player makes a massive dash buying several buildings on one go leaving everyone else absolutely flabbergasted and thinking 'Oh, the game ended now'. Of course this is the nature of the game, but for me premature ejaculation is always a big anticlimax. I want to toss my thing properly.

However, since the other players can thwart your plans thus pushing you off from the optimal path, the game offers meaningful decisions and asks for an ability to adapt. Therefore I'll rate the game a six.

Pleasant medium-weight, engine-building, pirate-y game.  It combines ideas from other games into a pretty cohesive package.  Seems a little more balanced than other Laukat games I've played.  Art and production are pretty darned good.  The game isn't all that forgiving if you don't build an engine right away, but that's fairly typical for such games.

Gorgeous art, as always from Mr. Laukat. Played a very polished prototype with mostly finished art @ bgg.con. Definitely concerned about degenerate strategies as one player purchased a combo of buildings that let him do nothing but search for treasure nearly every turn of the game and win by 20 over me and 40 over the rest of the field. 
The mechanics are simple, but still enjoyable. Even without the concern listed above, however, the game is still way too light to be that enjoyable or replayable, for my tastes at least.

Purchased through GeekMarket.

It is a great mid-weight game.  The aesthetic of the universe is so appealing.  The mechanics of the engine building aspects are not wholly intuitive.  The worker placement strategy of 'more workers is better' seems strong after a few plays.

In Islebound you will sail around the world visiting, attacking with pirates and sea serpents, or using influence and diplomacy to enter island cities and ports in order to collect goods, build buildings, engage in encounters and even brag about your exploits, all to gain renown(VP's).

Another wonderful Ryan Laukat game, plenty to do but it's all elegant and generally makes a lot of sense. Visit or attack towns to gain resources, or pirates and sea serpents you can use to attack other towns later. I love the interactive elements, added costs to raid opposing players' towns, and it creates a nice back and forth to keep you on your towns, though with a smaller player count you could likely avoid much of the confrontation. Killer art and components as usual, simple but flavorful and it's got that great light/medium weight that will attract players new to its mechanisms but also might be enough for gamers looking for something meatier.

In addition there are plenty of variants (and 'B-sides' of the map tiles) to keep the play fresh even without an inevitable expansion.

A Ryan Laukat game where players move ships between islands and conquer them with military and diplomacy. Controlling an island provides money when you take it over; it also gives you free actions there and earns you something when others take actions there. Like Above and Below, you hire workers who can be exhausted and even injured when taking actions. One action to take at different locations is to rest up workers. Islebound is a decent Euro game that looks great on the table. Laukat's artwork is very good and his ability to design games seems solid. I like Above and Below a lot more than Islebound due to the storytelling element and look forward to playing Near and Far. I'd play Islebound again, but I won't seek it out.

RATING: 8.5
Islebound is another beatufillu produced game from Red Raven games. Ryan Laukat knows what he's doing and his games, under his company "Red Raven Games", keep getting better and better. 

In Islebound, players captain a ship from their home port and go to various islands to pick up goods, trade goods, recruit a fighting force, or build their influence by completing events. With enough fighters or influence, they can conquer or ally, respectively, with new islands to take control of them, ultimately trying to build and buy buildings and gain the most renown to win the game.

There is a lot to try here and while my first full game landed me soundly in last place, it was very enjoyable just figuring out and executing a strategy nonetheless.

RATING: 9
A solid strategy game that uses the movement of ships between ports to create a nice variation on the worker placement theme. You pay coins, and sometimes expend crew, at ports, to gather wood and fish, allowing you to get crew and, eventually, enough diplomatic or military power to enable you to take over the ports.

Taking over a port gains you a large supply of coins, making it easier to gather more crew, wood and fish and more importantly, buildings, which are the largest source of reputation (victory points) in the game. The buildings come with various bonuses, such as lower costs, or additional ways to gain reputation.

Once you control a port, it no longer costs coins or crew expenditure for you to use it. 
Player conflict is minimal, as ships generally don't interfere with each other. But, if you want to increase costs for opponents, taking over ports that they control is entirely possible (at a slightly increase cost in military or diplomacy).

The interesting mechanism used in Above & Below, gaining "lanterns" in that game, is used to generate military might used to attack a port. Gathered pirates and serpents are deployed, with one dice rolled for each in an attempt to reach the needed port strength (+2 if owned by another player). Pirates have a one or two point contribution (one is guaranteed), while serpents have a two or three point contribution (nothing guaranteed). So, even if you have horrible luck in rolling dice, you can always choose to gather mostly pirates to give a more solid baseline in your attack. In addition, there is a single special serpent, that can generate either one or four attack points. It is only available when a specific building is constructed, so won't be present in all runs of the game. Crew can be wounded to add more points to the attack results. If an attack is successful, all of the pirates and serpents involved go back to the supply, If unsuccessful, only one of those is sacrificed to the supply to perform a retreat.

Overall, a nice mid-level strategy game that allows you to interact with other players, but not too dramatically, even when conflict does occur.

I really like Above and Below, its not a super deep game but all of its pieces work well together. Islebound is very similar to Above and Below to the point where some pieces can be used between games.

Islebound takes the well known Above and Below mechanics adds in a bit of player interaction, almost bordering on combat and throws in a little pick up and deliver to spice things up... This basically boils down to sailing around a board completing quests, building and pillaging. While not as good IMO as the original above and Below, this one pulls off a solid gaming experience that I will play again.

A perfectly fine euro game that borrows from many of Ryan's other games. Move around the board to take actions in various places to mostly gain and convert resources. The game feels strange in that you are moving around the board doing things specific to a location, but the end game trigger is building 7 buildings, something you can do at any location on the board and as many times as you want. Our game ended when 1 person was able to buy 4 of their 7 buildings on 1 turn, but that still took about 90 minutes to get to that point with 4 and that felt a little long for such an abrupt ending. If the game came in at 45-60 minutes I would be much more willing to play this. Combine the length with the contradiction in your turn focus and the end game condition, Islebound left me struggling to find the direction the game wanted me to take.

Islebound...又是一隻集合相同設計師與畫師的作品。Ryan 的前作有Above and below、Ancient World 、City of Iron 和 Eight Minute Empire。他的畫風清新令人十分舒服， Eight minutes Empire 是他一隻用少許卓頭成名之作, 而Above and below 擠身bgg ranking 200 內。我對Islebound有一定期望。KS 配件精美，木條粗魚兒大，今人放在手玩得容易。遊戲機制不複雜, gamer 很快便可上手, 玩家可走attack 和 diplomacy兩條大路線買building 搶分.  此遊戲可令怕骰運和怕正面衝突的玩家可專心走 diplomacy 也可致勝。當然好戰的玩家也可召喚海怪和買海盗去攻打城市。整體流暢節奏明朗。家人和non gamer(有玩過euro 的玩家) 都十分適合。若你已是老手可會覺得機制簡單沒特色。但與家人或 non-gamer 玩卻可享受遊戲畫風帶來的舒服。(人物背面可用於above and below), 若你已有和喜歡Above and below, 你是不會錯過Islebound 的。

RATING: 4
Impressions after one play: This is distinctly in the realm of ‘games I’m not interested in’. It is race game built on a very traditional action-selection engine. The core engine is, in fact, uninteresting enough that two mini-races for cards are set up to generate a bit more variety. There is very little dynamism – few to no inflection points or opportunities to dramatically change the game state – so, like many contemporary games it is a matter of taking the next small step on a very straight path to victory, trying to make your climb up the VP slope just that little bit steeper than your opponent. Blocking is not particularly strong, so the tactical considerations around it seem pretty bland. And the special powers associated with the VP buildings are pretty minimal, making their acquisition a pretty low-stakes game. Effectively, you lope about the board getting stuff to turn it into stuff to turn into victory points. Be slightly more efficient than the others and there you go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Beautiful. In terms of concept and design (as always, with Ryan). Mechanically, the game has one flaw - the Treasure Acquisition option, which I really do think should have had some form of restriction imposed. Be it a set of cards featuring maps containing each islet as a new resource, hand limit of two, that each player has to reach/spend in order to take the action (my preferred option), or just a chest token placed in the middle of each tile removed from play when the action is taken on one of its places and refreshed only when all four are gone. Very much like the way event  and reputation-gaining cards are integrated. I do wish the 'Raid' action were a standard (not variant) option... But as it all stands, very much the lightest of Red Raven Games' titles in every way.

Very attractive game. But not "busy" looking ([cough] Scythe [cough]). It's a "pleasant", not a "serious" game. I liked it. Has enough planning to make it worth planning a few moves ahead, with just enough player interaction to screw other people over, without actually attacking each other (although there's some of that too, but it's mostly for the spoils by the attacker; the loser doesn't lose much, so it doesn't really matter). Turns are pretty straight-forward, not a lot of AP, but decisions still feel interesting. A bit of randomness in cards, but they don't take effect immediately when seen, but rather when someone goes and activates them. I like that kind of card use. Seems too whimsical to go 8, but at the higher end of 7 right now. One possible concern that came up in our first game is that seems that players who get off on the wrong foot may be screwed. There's no catch up mechanism. Seems true, but I'm not sure yet whether it's a real problem, or whether after a learning game it's easy enough to avoid the death spiral.

Great and very relaxing game. Would be a good way to finish a long gaming session. Agree with the comment below that it is more of an engine building game than anything else. Start by collecting fish and lumber and a book or two, then use them to build for combat/diplomacy, take over islands, gain gold, buy buildings -- in later turns your engine will really start to pay off with various combos based on buildings/islands owned etc. To me, it plays like a more complex version of Splendor ... believe it or not :)

Beautiful art and components. I personally like the combat, and found that a strategy combining combat and diplomacy (rather than relying on just one) was the best path to victory. Played only with two so far -- would love to see how 3 or more players opens up more strategies but also makes for a tighter, more contested board. Using the 'close quarters' variation is essential with two players. Looking forward to see what the metropolis expansion adds...

Enjoyable pirate game where players move about attacking or negotiating control over islands, picking stuff up, selling things, and so on. Definitely a bit of an engine builder--you need to look for the synergies on the board between nearby islands as well as powers you can gain to play off these. Combine things in the right way and race to the end. Not sure others see this, based on reviews. As sustainable from Ryan, a pretty and charming game.

Compete to build the best sea-faring nation with up to three friends by collecting treasure, hiring crew, and conquering or befriending island towns. In Islebound, you take command of a ship and crew. You sail to island towns, collecting resources, hiring crew, and commissioning buildings for your capital city. Each building has a unique ability, and your combination of buildings can greatly enhance your strength as a trader, builder, or invader. You also recruit pirates and sea monsters to conquer towns, which, once conquered, allow you to complete the town action for free, and charge a fee to opponents if they want to use it. Alternatively, you can complete events that give influence, which can be used to befriend towns.The player with the most wealth and most-impressive capital city will win the game!

Fun and whimsical seafaring game. Similar to Above & Below in many regards, but with less of a story-telling element.

Super smooth and quick worker placement with great art. 

Edit: ... and so much more. With each play my appreciation grows. This has become my favorite resource conversion point salad - which is not a genre I love, generally speaking. But islebound gets it all right across the board: 
There's a feeling of progress and accomplishment,
Great variety of strategies to dabble in, but all are balanced,
Money = points, which I always like,
Different satisfying combos that pop up in each game to find and exploit.

I can't recommend it highly enough. People who actually like the genre will find Islebound indispensable, and probably rate it a perfect 10.

This game is beautiful and a lot of fun, though I think it could use just a *little* bit more complexity and variety. The Metropolis Expansion helps a bit, but it feels like it is missing something. I am not quite sure what it is, and I do not want to over-emphasize this, but I feel like this is a really good game just short of being great. It is a good game, though--lovely, smooth, and thematic. Its characters can also be used in the game Above and Below.

You sail from one island to another each turn in an effort to collect resources and crew. They are used to help gain influence and renown by taking over towns (through force or diplomacy), and "buying" or "building" buildings.

The sole end game condition of a player building their eighth building might need tweaking, so I look forward to trying out some of the official and unofficial variants to see if they help any in that regard.

Bonus points for reminding me of Zelda: Windwaker as I play.

Gift from the b/f as he is going away with friends for the whole weekend :)

hmm, what to say about this one. I...dont? like it. I think... maybe?.

The above deck/below deck mechanic is a very similar mechanic to that found in above and below however here you are rarely having to actually send your crew below deck and a single action refreshes them all immediately anyway, it didn't really feel like there was much to actually manage with the crew. :(

Influence and combat numbers on the ports seem a little low, especially the one which lets you 'buy' buildings for resources instead of cash. And the buildings themselves are very cheap and therefore the whole game feels like a race to seven buildings, thus money and that one port are king, and honestly you don't really need to bother interacting with any of the rest of the actual game.

I quite like the renown track which gives you an instant boon if/when you hit seven and then resets you to zero, and I quite like the way the influence track works with cubes being worth variable amounts dependant upon how far right you manage to get them placed, however the nature of this game doesn't really allow that to shine as you need at most 3-4 cubes of the lowest numbers(which you can get in a single turn) to influence any port you want, so why push to the higher numbers at all?

Traded (2017) for lotus and cash(£)

What this game has going for it is a whimsical artistic style that suggests story, and then the game teases the players with story in the form of event cards. But the event cards are soulless euro adventure cards, giving wood and fish that I can already get on 5 other locations...

And that leave a bright, cute, incredibly complicated middleweight resource conversion game. I think I'll check out Above and Below, and hope for better, but I wonder if Laukat's designs are milquetoast for me.

Another good looking game by Ryan Laukat. This one shares a few mechanisms with Above and Below. This game feel a lot like games like Istanbul and Yokohama where you race around the board trying to find the optimal path.

It's fun, the rules are intuitive and there is a good bit of variability in the box.

Nagyon szép, nagyon hangulatos. Az mechanikák is érdekesek, de valahogy még sincs teljesen egyben. Nagyon kéne emellé az ember mellé valami profi team, mert így úgy érzem ngayszerű játékok mennek kárba. Fájdalmasan sok múlik a kontrollálhatatlan körülményeken, értelmetlen előre tervezni bármit is, és a győzelemhez mindenképp kell, hogy a többiek számodra előnyöseket lépjenek. Ezen felül kicsit hógolyós is, ami tovább súlyosbítja a fenti problémát.

If I didn't self-identify as a Eurogamer I might say Islebound is the Eurogamer's Merchants & Marauders; that only works if you think of Euros as the modern day minimally interactive puzzle optimizers, however. Which would be very much misguided, of course.
So instead, I'm going to say that Islebound is a modern day minimally interactive puzzle optimizer. An abundance of material and seemingly different paths to take cannot hide the fact that it's really a rather simple game in which the main objective is charting a course that yields ever so slightly more VP than the other players'. And despite the very different labels on the paths they are really all quite similar to each other.
The all too common lack of editing and post-release patching just complete the picture. And yet, the game doesn't play quite as badly as all that may sound. There is a glimmer of promise on the horizon but it surely isn't easy to find. An able lookout might have saved this ship.

Game play is really good. We enjoy that, but the ending condition is the most ugly thing of Islebound. Game won't end easily if no one buy/build the building so most session went too long (our last 3 games have to cut end at 3-4 buidings because it's already longer than 2 hours.)

Game design - graphic is always great for Ryan's work but the size is not. It takes too much unnecessary table space. The center board is awfully large. I think it can be smaller than this.

I really want to like this game, as I love the art and I love that it's different, but the building cards which can't be read from across the table ruined it. Two out of three of us were just buying them blindly as it was too much work to figure out what they did. If you're not doing buildings properly, you're not winning.

I have, in the past, not enjoyed Ryan Laukat's games.  They all felt half-finished and too similar.  Islebound definitely borrows elements from previous games, but this is by far his best effot.  The renown track is a pretty cool aspect.  I still think he tries a bit too hard to make EVERYTHING connect to everything else.  Still, Islebound is a good looking game, it's fairly quick, and it's fun.

RATING: 7.5
Probably Red Raven's best so far, although I think I like Artifacts, Inc more.

Interesting mix of elements.  Feels like a modular worker placement with many bonuses and special powers from buildings,etc.

Fun to play.  Shaped chits are nice resources to handle.  

Design is still unrefined: for example, game only ends when 8 buildings are built*.  Could go on forever if no one builds.  Other rough edges too. 

Overall satisfying and enjoyable.

*designer has since posted and said that now running out of renown can trigger end game too.

Art and materials are nice, but I feel Ryan and team phoned this one in. Although the game is designed adequately, it's not really any more than that and it doesn't shine or stand out. I really get the feeling that the game was simply not developed sufficiently to burnish what was good about it and eliminate what is ho hum about it.

In particular, Ryan's overuse of the "buy a building worth VPs" mechanic is wearing thin and should have been replaced with something more compelling. There are some very strange elements to the game, such as the fact that control of a town is essentially worthless outside of one special card--why even bother with this mechanic then? I feel like more time spent with the game would have allowed it to develop more character; it feels unripe.

So, this game is likeable, like most Red Raven games, but in a very generic way. To me, Ryan's games feel like he's cruising with a well-known formula and art style rather than pushing himself to innovate. There are some great seeds here, like the way the influence track works, but I'd really like to see Ryan stretch as a designer and develop these seeds into something unique and special.

I liked my one play of it (2p). My opponent was on the fence. Needs more plays for sure. As with all his games the art is amazing.

It was fun for me though as it was.

A really wonderful take on the privateer/pirate theme. Gorgeous art, and speedy, meaningful turns make this game a great middle/light-middle weight complexity game.

NOT above and below. This was a reoccuring thing taht came up during play. So this is a game where you travel to different islands to take actions. you are trying to build as many buildings as possible while sailing around. Not sure about the theme but the game play is okay. I do wish that this had been more like A&B like you land and can take the action or do an adventure. So for me to be honest the setup is a bit long for what you are doing. seems like it could have been a double sided rectangle board and made set up so much easier.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Typical Ryan Laukat's game: it kind of works, it's kind of pleasant, but it's also unbalanced and underdeveloped. And of course, it has his crude artwork that so many gamers inexplicably love. Another common feature is the horrible graphic and production design, which make the game take an unnecessarily huge amount of table space, with lots of important info that is unreadable from a distance.

The game is a bit overwhelming at first, with apparently multiple paths to victory, but it basically comes down to resource conversion. However, it can be very punitive if you don't plan properly, since you need money to perform actions and the only easy way to get more depends on the other players not grabbing it before you do. I enjoyed my only play, but there is nothing particularly engaging or fun, like fighting titans in "The Ancient World" - which still is my favorite game from this designer.

Fine game but strategies which you may use seems lame. Grabbing money from the middle with hunt treasure is not a great mechanics and may become easily unbalanced through the game. Also you may just go for one direction and without doing nothing, may grap enough points to beat other players who tried their best. I dont think it is a solid game and i dont either think it is fine at 4.

2 or 3 player versions would be better.

Takes a lot of the mechanics from Above and Below and tosses in a nautical theme where you can pillage towns to take over or use your diplomacy to take ownership of islands.

If you've played Above and Below the rules won't be hard to grasp.

The symbology can be a bit confusing for new players and might take a game before they remember what each symbol means. An easy thing to forget is paying the cost of the islands (usually 1 coin, sometimes requires exhausting a crew member).

The components are great, the art on the board makes it easy to tell where you are although the little colored flag on the ship makes it difficult to tell which ship is which at a cursory glance.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (September 2016)

A friend wanted to play Islebound and when I realized it was from designer Ryan Laukat, I tried to bail out, but he told me it would take only 1 hour (it actually took more than twice that amount of time :(). Islebound is exactly what I was expecting from Laukat. A gorgeous but mediocre game (for me, my friend likes it).

The rules are pretty easy to teach. You can do it under 12 minutes.

I heavily dislike pirate themes, but here you don´t feel you are playing as a pirate. 

The game components and art are very good. As is usual from Laukat the production values are very high. However the art, although good, is perhaps out of place? I mean, I have never seen smiling pirates that seem like they would love to help you with any problem instead of attacking you :D. Still, this is a very minor concern but a first in a pirate game.

Islebound has a light-medium weight. Its decisions aren’t very hard and there is a lot of uncontrollable luck with the events and missions. Sometimes a new mission will pop up in front of you and you can win some reputation very easily. There is less luck (but luck nonetheless) with the buildings. Overall the level of randomness is high and you (generally) cannot mitigate it with clever play because you don’t know what are the next card requirements or where it will appear. The combat has luck in it, but here you can clearly mitigate it and you clearly know the odds of the attack. To summarize, in combat, luck is controllable so it doesn’t bothers me, but with the cards, luck is uncontrollable so it bothers me a lot!

Player interaction is low. When you attack someone ‘s island you don’t actually cost him VPs (I kind of like that).

Playtime is WAY TOO LONG for what it offers. Its duration should be at least half for a game this light.

All of Ryan Laukat´s games feel very similar to me and I have disliked every one of them so far, I’m just not his target audience.

Bottom line, Islebound is a mediocre game for me. There is nothing truly wrong with it, but, it doesn’t excite me in any way either. The luck factor is very high for a game that goes beyond two hours of play. It is way too long for what it offers. I will do my best to stay away from it

I have a real love hate thing going with Red Raven. I love to buy their games, but always end up hating to play them.

The art, world building and ideas are all sound and usually quite impressive. Unfortunately they're just lacking a development process. The games all look beautiful, and sound awesome on paper, but in practice they fall far short of the mark. As if they've been underdeveloped.

I like the art in [person=11854]Ryan Laukat[/person]'s games, but the game part is usually pretty bland. Unfortunately, this was not an exception.

On the positive side I liked the score track that gives you a bonus for every 7 points you earn during the game. I liked the interaction on the map. Players can take control of locations which earns them points immediately and taxes opponents who want to visit and use that action. You can take possession away from others but it's more difficult than normal. Typically you don't care much if someone takes the location from you.

The game is brimming with well trodden mechanisms, like so much teal (seriously this game is covered in shades of teal). It works, but it's a bit much.

I'm finding it difficult to articulate my thoughts on this one. Maybe it's a much better game than I think and it simply didn't work for me for whatever reason. I would play if asked but it isn't something I would typically suggest.

The game is a standard Euro, resource management game, with a cool theme. I like both the Diplomacy and Military take-overs, how they're different in feel, yet balanced, and the buildings' effects. That being said, two mechanisms make this for me: (1) the bragging, where you can declare a scoring situation which makes everybody, not just you, score for something in particular; (2) the scoring track, which is only 7 spaces long, and whenever you get 7 points, you get a small random bonus. I feel like both of those things also have lots of potential for expansions, and I hope they'll be used again in other games.

In Islebound, you take command of a ship and crew. You sail to island towns, collecting resources, hiring crew, and commissioning buildings for your capital city. Each building has a unique ability, and your combination of buildings can greatly enhance your strength as a trader, builder, or invader. You also recruit pirates and sea monsters to conquer towns, which, once conquered, allow you to complete the town action for free, and charge a fee to opponents if they want to use it. Alternatively, you can complete events that give influence, which can be used to befriend towns.

RATING: 6.5
Pro: 
- A beautiful game.
- Moving around on a map - that's something I always prefer.

Con:
- It's not the most complex game ever, but still feels more complex than necessary - more complex than what would be best for this lightish gameplay.
- Role of luck can be too high. Normally the game might be balanced, but the order event cards and buildings turn up, combined with the luck of the dice, can be just too much.
- And this luck level is especially annoying in a game where you have to start your engine as soon as possible. If you are unlucky in these in the beginning, there is little chance you'll catch up speed later.

But.
We played one crucial rule wrong which doesn't really change what's written above, but I believe it would have helped the game overall. I need to play it again to find out - it's so bad that the rulebook is so unprofessionally written!

Surprisingly, rather than exploring and combat, this game is more of gathering resources (of which our crew is one), and racing to obtain points from islands or buying buildings, to bring the game end

 I wasn't expecting a race, but I wasn't disappointed. There are a variety of combos, and it does have a fairly tight logistics component.

Update: 

More plays sees this game play as quickly as advertised, and with all players pursuing different avenues. It was a vast improvement over our initial plays, which was not bad to begin with..

This one is a ton of fun, and easy on the eyes.

Islebound is probably Ryan Laukat's best game. It's successfully synergies all the best elements of his last few games. You can see the pedigree of The Ancient World, Above and Below, and Artifacts Inc. in this game and it all works. The endgame trigger is a bit clutchy (having to build a certain number of buildings) but the game itself is great. So beautiful and so entertaining!

One of my new favorite games! Once I got it, I kept playing it, despite having a bunch of unplayed games, just because the art is so good and the game play silky smooth. It's relatively easy to learn and teach, and has just the right amount of player interaction to keep things exciting. Plus I am a sucker for island and pirate themes!  I got a secondhand copy which is signed by Ryan Laukat, so I love my copy.

This is the quintessential "easy to learn, difficult to master" game. Turns are simple, yet the strategic options are incredibly deep. It features Ryan Laukat's beautiful, signature art style and its characters can be used in Above and Below. The combat and diplomacy mechanics accomplish similar results with incredibly different mechanisms, adding just a touch of randomness. Pirates, sea serpents and a vast array of buildings complete the setting, resulting in an epic adventure.

I just didn't get into it. Guess it's not my style. I felt like the game was biased towards diplomacy and penalized you more for fighting your way through it. It takes much more prep work to attack, and when the game works off of a limited number of turns, optimizing your turns favors the diplomacy route.

Pros:
-Semi worker placement with Ships
-Artwork is fantastic

-Luck mitigation 

Cons:
-Same mechanisms and concepts reused from previous Red Raven games
-Can be AP prone
-Takes up a lot of table space for a lighter game.

I liked Artifacts Inc. and City of Iron, but I love Islebound. It has that addictive worker placement, one more turn vibe, and it looks absolutely amazing on the table. While the actions are pretty simple, there are always a ton of choices, and it's not obvious what to do - there are many paths to victory.

I'm rating this conservatively as I want to see how the balance feels after multiple plays, though nothing seemed off in my first game.

Update: love the elegant smoothness of this game - wonderful and replayable. Books does seem a little bit strong, particularly at lower player counts - the main culprit IMO is the Library, which could probably use a nerf.

This game straddles a few genres, it's part area control, part worker placement, with a splash of tableau building and the final result is a lot of fun. The one move one action turn structure keeps the game moving at a fast pace, meaning it plays well at all counts, however there's definitely a more cutthroat feel at higher numbers. This serves as a lighter game for when you don't want too much brain burn or you want to introduce newer gamers. Also of note is the expansion for Above and Below that is included in here which is a great little addition.

Islebound looks like a pick up and delivery game, but its not. It kinda looks like an area control game, but its not. It has workers like a worker placement game, but its not that either. Islebound is more of an engine building game.  Moving your ship around the Archipelago increasing your combat and your influence to take over islands and build more buildings that give you more abilities that hopefully mesh with your strategy (build your engine), is what islebound is all about. It does this very well and is loads of fun and fairly balanced in my experience.
My only problem with Islebound is that there are so few buildings (2) that you have the option of buying right from the start, either making it dictate your strategy/engine early on, or not helping you with your engine.

RATING: 3
A pretty dull pick-up and deliver game that's all about converting resources into points. This game takes all the worst parts of Above and Below and Empires of the Void, and combines them into a pretty dry Euro exercise. This is pretty disappointing, as Red Raven Games usually puts out some quality stuff. In many ways, this feels like Laukat's take on Black Fleet, but you're also dealing with the obligatory tableau of buildings with powers, for some reason. Black Fleet does what this game does in a much better way.

On your turn, you set sail to an island, either for a visit, to conquer it, or own it through diplomacy. Each island has a special ability, either to let you collect more crew members, collect books, gain renown (VPs), collect fish/ wood, gain pirates/sea monsters or build. There are a number of face up buildings which provide renown  and give you abilities during the game.  You can conquer a town by rolling dice with the pirates or sea monsters you have collected, and the reward is in gold. Diplomacy is conducted by the number of influence points you have and also reward you gold. The game ends when someone constructs their 7th building. 

A number of mechanisms are copied from Above and Below, where crew members can get exhausted, but a bed will rest the entire crew. Okay, you are thinking to yourself, where is the joke? I'll leave that to your imagination. 

It's a decent game, and I definitely want to play more. It's fresh, and I like the different things you can do at each island. There are different strategy approaches as well.

RATING: 6.5
Very linear game that seems imbalanced. Books to power conversion seems to be too strong, also because you get all the resources from the 7 points cards. In addition there doesn't seem to be enough reason to invest in diplomacy or military to attack cities since it only gives some money (treasure hunting a few times equals the benefits but cost less actions).

In Islebound, players sail around a modular board in a ship, interacting with various islands to gain resources of different types. Islands have an admission cost, and after that's paid, a player either gain free resources, or exchange resources for other resources. Islands can be taken over by a player using either military (which expends certain resources and relies on dice rolls) or diplomacy (which expends other resources), but each island can usually only be subject to one of these types of take-overs. Once taken over, the island provides a large money bonus, that player doesn't have to pay the admission cost, and all other players must pay that player. At the end of a player's turn, that player can purchase a building, which are the main source of points in the game, but also provide a special ability. There isn't very much interaction in the game, but landing on the same island where someone else is does cost extra. On the whole, I thought the game was fairly pleasant and enjoyable.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
UPDATE: After several more game plays, and after adding the Metropolis Expansion, I'm increasing my score to a solid 8.

THE WINS
+ Gorgeous hand-drawn immersive game-art and visual experience (probably one of the best out there).
+ Easy to learn without a bunch of complex symbology, and can be taught in 10-15 minutes to new players.
+ Family friendly with a minimal "take that" mechanism (unless you're playing with the "raiding" variant from the back of the book).
+ Depth of strategy - The "chains and combos" of this game are just GREAT. Essentially you "get A", which allows you to "get B, which allows you to "get C" which allows you to earn X points. Simple to learn, but every game you play seems to deepen it even more.
+ TONS of choices - Instead of starting narrow, and then slowly unlocking the width of the game, this one starts off WIDE with almost every choice available to you. Your strategy then, is to carefully negotiate the myriad of tempting and luring decisions, and focus on ONE unique path to victory.
+ Super high quality game pieces made of thick cardboard. Every piece feels great in the hand.
+ Has a design that just begs for expansions and has several "variants" of game play included in the instruction book.
+ Relatable to a lot of people. It's rare that I see a game with this much gender and ethnic diversity. Something to be applauded.

THE JUST OKAY
- Modular game board separates during gameplay and requires multiple adjustments during the game. (A game mat really helps here).
- Not as good with only 2 players: With 16 open locations to travel to at any time, and plenty of resources to go around, it's EASY to feel like you're both just playing your own game without ever bumping into each other. *It's of note that the 2-player "close quarters" variant does noticably address some of these issues but not all of them. This game really seems to shine with 3-4 players.
- Only 25% of the building cards you can buy feel like they make any real difference on the "engine" you're building. A few give you a clear advantage and you will find yourself competing with others players just to get them, which is awesome, but the MAJORITY of the time you're just buying buildings for the renown.

**House rule fix:  I thinned both the main and Metropolis expansion decks to remove the "fluff" cards and only kept the desirable ones. This completely fixed the problem and added needed game tension. Highly Recommended! 

-Game end trigger of "whenever someone eventually builds their 7th building," can feel too random. Wondering if it would have been better if the game was played in 7 rounds, so you feel more tension and urgency to get things done because you know, like the chapters of a book, that the ending is approaching.
- Feels like it's missing a scoreboard. You have to pull out your calculator at the end to tally everything, which is not terrible, but not ideal.
-4 different ships, with 4 different colored flags, with 4 different crews,... and when you pick your boat, you could really care less which one you have. Can't help but feel it was a miss to not give each boat their own identity, perhaps with different advantages to each (ex: some being better at war, others at negotiation, bonuses for completing quests, etc.). Again, it's a little thing that goes a long way.

SUMMARY:
Islebound is a clever and beautifully designed game that allows you to build "renown" in the archipelago through being known for 1) Real estate by building buildings, 2) Being a smarty pants by collecting knowledge/science 3) Bragging of your accomplishments in having the most X (or whatever combo you like), as well as offering you two paths toward those ends (diplomacy or piracy).

A fun game that creates a world I want to jump into.

This is my 4th Laukat game in the "Lauketverse" (Above and Below, Islebound, City of Iron 2nd ed, Near and Far).

Islebound is a well-themed (as are many Red Raven games) board game about building prestige in a maritime environment. Each player controls a fleet, which is composed of crew members and possibly pirates. Players compete to gain the most renown. Being maritime in nature, money directly translates to renown.

What I most like is that there are a lot of options in how to gain money/renown, so it's not strategically limited. That said, it's not completely wide open either - it's up to the player to determine which path to pursue and how to efficiently put their plans into motion in a sustainable way.

Great artwork, well paced, well themed, light enough to fit most gaming situations, but heavy enough to scratch the strategy itch. In other words, works well for almost any group in almost any occasion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Despite its efforts to the contrary I feel the game is more economic than thematic. That said, it's still a very enjoyable game, just that I don't feel like a pirate or adventurer out at sea but more-so the captain's accountant. Successful combat is extremely difficult and so I'm reluctant to pursue it; mostly I just sail around trading for fish and wood and slowly building up renown. I'd definitely be up for playing if it hits the table, just not sure I need to own it myself.

Picked up a copy from PIFF and was excited to try it. I am a fan of Ryan Laukat, but his games don't usually hold up in my groups. My favorite title is City of Iron and then this one. This one might take it's place for its ease of teaching and playing and that is plays pretty quickly. It is harder to get CoI played for it being more difficult and longer game. This title is definitely more main stream and I have enjoyed the few plays I have had so far. I look forward to several more plays. It is even a pick up and delivery type game but plans change and course of actions change depending on other players. Definitely interesting and worth playing.

Solid resource-conversion pick-up and deliver game on a mechanically small, but physically large board.

RATING: 5
This is a quick and light path finding game, where on your turn you sail your movement in number of spaces, then choose to either use the island ability in some way, or prospector and get however much money has accumulated from other player's paying island ability costs.  

The game feels a little uncomfortable, since at the start of the game getting crew is super important, but then the crew pile runs out fast and those spots become worthless. When you reach an island you have the option to conquer it, which requires spending cards that you then roll dice for, in a way that feels more random than I typically like in a euro. You also have the option to take it with diplomacy which requires spending cubes on a diplomacy track. The track itself has different values for the cube spots, and you fill left to right, so maybe you lined yourself up for a turn to get a lot of valuable cubes on your next turn, and then your opponent spends the cubes they had on the track, and now suddenly you are putting into 1 value spots instead of 3 value spots. The way you get cubes is by resolving events that pop around the board randomly, and all require different things, so there's some substantial advantage to being in the right place at the right time with the right stuff, which also feels more random than I like.

Overall, this isn't a bad game. I wouldn't say the randomness is detrimental, just marginally annoying. I would be willing to play this more, but I don't think I need to own it.

A nice looking game especially if you like Teal. Mostly an expand and exploit game with a bit of worker placement thrown in for good measure. Mechanically it seems sound. As you move around locations you are trying to get the right mix resources and money to efficiently progress in scoring. As strategy you are trying to get some synergy on locations and buildings, It appears to be more short/medium term rather then long term.
 
Taking over locations require one of two types of resources depending on location. It provides a large money bonus (vital), and exempts you from having to pay to execute the action, but no victory point bonuses. Taking over another player location only hurts the other player if they need to return to the location for the action. They now have to pay you. So don't feel defensive when a location you own is taken. 

As a whole not a lot of interaction, blocking on the map only slightly forces up the cost, but if mishandled can delay your progress. Most of the game is collecting money and converting it into buildings to cement victory points and acquire special bonuses and actions.

For me, art aside, this is the yardstick for an average modern game. unfortunately the gameplay just isn't as interesting as the game is pretty. There are no new interesting game mechanics, no significant player interaction and altogether too many options which are similar and not particularly interesting.

A game of sailing the high seas for adventure, taking over ports via combat and diplomacy.  The goal of the game is actually to make money, which you get primarily from taking over ports, and which you can store in buildings that give you bonuses.  Like most Red Raven games, the art is very pretty, but the rules could stand to be clearer and the templating of abilities cleaned up to standardize the terms used to refer to actions, and features some bizarre choices such as explaining what each port does specifically instead of explaining the icons in general and then just letting you rely on that straightforward symbology.  Once we figured things out, it flowed fairly quickly.  I still haven't found a Red Raven game I like as much as Eight Minute Empire Legends, though.

Complex pirate game with many paths to victory. Military strategy seems favorable for a short game, whereas diplomacy is better suited for a longer game. Little point in maxing out movement. Incorporating the Raid & Trading variants encourages player interaction. Treasure hunting also a viable strategy.

[Kickstarter edition] Played my first time on Monday and had a good time. It was a two player game and I lost pretty badly to my sister. I think next time we'll definitely play with the "close quarters" variant as we never ended our movement in the same area with the base rules. I know people say that this is a light game - and it is - but I think there are some really cool elements to explore here! I'll just need to find the right mix of rules to maximize my experience since there are so many options (advanced vs regular tiles, metropolis expansion, variants, etc...) . And of course, the game is gorgeous! Kickstarter only comment: I will say that having the wooden ships, fish, and wood makes it feel really weird to just have the cardboard book tokens - really wish we had hit that stretch goal! :)

This game is great! The artwork, the rules, all the pieces. 
It feels like a deckbuilder where you have to set up an entire economy (with a bit of light piratey roleplaying) in order to pay for the cards you want in your deck. 

I am quite blown away by how well two seemingly different game-mechanics were intertwined into this nice gem of a game.

This is an incredible game that gets it right on many levels. It is both very thematic and mechanically sound. It is fairly accessible but still has depth. It requires a good mix of strategy and tactics. This is something of a 2X game. It delivers huge on the expand and exploit aspects as player build their island empires and get some true synergy. There is not much explore since the board is set at the beginning of the game. Players can find themselves in conflict, but it helps that owning an area is not worth point it just makes getting things done more efficient. This game is also a bit of a sandbox game as players can take a variety of approaches to the game. However, it is a well defined sandbox, so the game keeps from getting overwhelming. Overall this is a great game.

This is my favorite Ryan Laukat game by far! It has elements of Above & Below, 8 Minute Empire, and The Ancient World while avoiding the agonizing limited round count with which other Red Raven games seem to be plagued. Very cool modular board and inclusion of characters that can be used in Above & Below as well!

I really enjoy this game, but the power of books is quite strong; since the board is modular seems like a future expansion could help bring some balance to the game-play; as-is it's basically a run on the renown track to drain the 7 value tiles as quickly as possible

My favorite aspect is sailing from island to island doing actions in the best order to achieve one's goals.  The art is awesome, as expected from Red Raven.  Rules are not complex, but learning all the town actions can be tough the first time you play (after that it is smooth sailing).

Was fairly bland and boring in my eyes. Nothing was new and nothing stood out as interesting. Everything felt so straight forward and simple. Maybe it is just the light weight nature of the game or maybe I was in a weird mood when I played it, but the game was just "meh" to me. The art is fantastic and the overall design is fine, it just doesn't do anything great and when I'm playing a 2 hour game I'm looking for something more than just that.

tl;dr: yet another enjoyable Laukat game

How can you be a very solid game designer, very solid artist, very solid graphic designer and run a publishing business all at once? And on top of that be productive enough to put out 2 or 3 games a year? Impressive.
So far I've played most (but not all) Laukat designs and I've enjoyed all of them. Some more than others, but all of them are very solid designs that play well and are visually appealing. This game is no different.
The way in which you need to combine the different resources and crew members to perform the most efficient actions is a very enjoyable puzzle. But by that I don't mean this is multiplayer solitaire. There certainly is interaction and competition going on on the modular board.
A very solid game from Laukat again. Not my favorite of his, but certainly worth playing.

Based on a single two-player game, so take all this with a grain of salt. However, Islebound plays like Laukat's magnum opus based on the experience gained with games like Empires of the Void, Eight-Minute Empire, Artifacts, Inc., and City of Iron. There are mechanisms from all those games, but remixed in an interesting way, and without any of the cruft. The play-time is reasonable and the puzzle is intriguing. The two-player experience is not ideal, but it's fine for learning the basics. I suspect a three- or four-player game is where the game gains tension, which is the one thing I felt was lacking (at least a little bit). I look forward to future plays.

Istambul-like, but less elegant and more multiplayer solitaire. Heavy emphasis of card-based combos and engine building, a fact which slipped by me for almost all the game until the end. Didn't particularly like the end game trigger, which is goal based (the first player to play 7 cards triggers it) rather than point based, making it longer than it should have been and emphasizing the solitaire aspect rather than the race aspect. Cute looks, but it is a dry euro. Didn´t hate it but didn´t particularly liked any part of it.

If I want a relaxing game yet strategic enough not to turn off my brain, Islebound would be my choice. The theme and artwork is great and the turn actions are simple. Its a game where even if I lose, I'm not mad about it and I feel I still achieve something.

Money is tight in this game and the only way to generate it is to control the area. I enjoy the idea of taking over an area via combat or diplomacy. If gives players alternatives and not focus on just one route to victory. There are tons of building cards to go through and each grants you abilities/rewards.

I enjoy Red Raven games and can't wait to try out more!

My second play of this was a bit better than my first, it's a decent if not great game.  It doesn't do anything wrong, other than possibly ending a bit sooner than I would like (you don't have a lot of time to build an engine with buildings).

The decision space is good enough, the influence cube track thing is unique yet a bit gamey the art is good as always from Ryan's games.  

I don't know if I would request it but I'd absolutely play it if asked.  

It's also going to clock in at probably under an hour even with 4 players, which is always pleasant.

RATING: 7
In the game, players are captains of a ship who are roaming around a series of islands trying to get money and fame. On your turn, you must move, then do one of our main actions and possibly some free actions. The actions are "Visit a town" which lets you do the action of that location for the cost of the entry fee, "Hunt for treasure" which lets you scoop up the entry fees people have been paying, and "Conquer a town" or "Ally with a town" which let you take control of a town. Taking over a town lets you do the action of the town for free, gives you some money depending on how strong the town is, and negates the need for you to pay entry fees to that town in the future. Conquering is done by spending pirates and sea serpents while allying is done by spending influence cubes.

As free actions you can buy buildings or resolve an event. Buildings give you points equal to their cost at game end and give you some special ability. Events require you to be somewhere specific and pay some cost and give you influence cubes. Additionally, there are a couple of special locations. One that lets you spend fish and wood to build buildings (which is different than buying them), one lets you hire crew who come with special abilities and one that lets you get renown (VP's) by triggering one of the two current renown goals. There are of course lots of places that let you get fish, wood, pirates, sea serpents, books, renown, and rest your crew (who must be exhausted to do certain actions).

The game ends when one player builds 7 buildings (in a four player game). The round finishes out and then everyone has one last turn. The renown you've gotten during the game is added to the renown of your buildings, and money is converted 1:1 to renown, and the most renown wins.

The game seems fairly quick and has some interesting stuff going on. There are many elements borrowed from other Laukat designs, but it's got a unique twist with the ship movement action selection. There's a penalty to going to the same spot as someone else, but it can be done. Money is a little tight in the early game, and there's a rush to buy building as the game nears completion. So timing is a very important consideration throughout the game.

The artwork is great but the game isn´t any fun. The rules are too long, the mechanisms are very similar to Above & Below or City of Iron (you have to rest your characters before you use them again, etc.). We won´t be playing this gain.

RATING: 7.5
Preliminary rating after a single two player game. I was really on the fence about Islebound, as I love City Of Iron (1st edition), but was not really enamoured with Eight-Minute Empire Legends (although it is still an OK game) or Artifacts, Inc (which did not grab me at all). After  the Lost Lands expansion for EME Legends, I even started to worry that Ryan did not playtest his games thoroughly enough, as he quickly came up with variants and alternative rulings as a reaction to players' complaints about his games. When Above and Below was released, he added a story telling aspect to a relatively simple worker placement game, while I was hoping he would return to more serious, complex games like City Of Iron instead. Despite all of this, I still wanted to give Islebound a go after listening to some positive reviews, and my first game did not disappoint! Like City Of Iron, the game is easy to play, yet still offers lots of different actions in an interesting world/setting. Too bad that Ryan still had to add a new end game condition to the rules after the game was released, but if that's all I can certainly live with that. I just hope that he will release an interesting expansion for the game in the future, just like the excellent one that he did for City Of Iron. Meanwhile, looking forward to my next play...
UPDATE: Additional plays have solidified my rating. Such a wonderful race to the finish in such an interesting setting...

Easy enough to learn, but it felt really repetitive. Surely better at higher player counts, as the purchasing of islands can be both strategic and generate more money, also forcing players on different routes or even blocking them. But with two, there wasn't much to it, took a long time, and we quit before we finished all the rounds. Would play again, but not interested in owning it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Own Kickstarter edition, commenting here as it's likely more visible. 

Very good overall, I prefer this to Above and Below, mostly because I feel like the "military" option is actually a viable strategy in this one (don't get me started about recent euro-thematic hybrids that include combat but nerf it heavily, it's an ongoing peeve of mine). There's also less whining from the table when you conquer places, since resources are only really gained on conquest and control isn't worth VPs, you're not costing people much. 

Like most of Laukat's games, however, I'm not sure if all of the parts are particularly balanced. In particular the building that lets you ignore costs for using towns that are owned by other people. This is very strong, and only gets stronger as the game goes on. It allows you to run resource - VP production / conversion chains very rapidly in the late game (especially crew-books-renown), since gold is usually what puts the brakes on you, forcing you to treasure hunt or raid rather than continuing your production chain. 

My only other complaint is that this seems very long for its weight, although this may be due to our inexperience with the game and how late we were playing it. It took us at least 2.5 hours, 3 with the rules explanation.

Extremely short turns and a gorgeous implementation of theme make for a fun and easy to enjoy romp, which I will call a worker placement game for lack of a better genre to throw it in. Quick to learn for new players, and plays in about an hour. For people who don't like getting screwed in worker placement games, I'm happy to report that Islebound's "ship placement" is more of a mild impediment than a hard block.

RATING: 7
The game plays very different than I thought, there's no pickup and delivery and not a ton of player interaction unless you add variants, instead it's much more a great theme on basically a worker placement.  It's fairly simple, but the combo's and tactics build up as you play, as well as the interaction.  The color aesthetic is beautiful and the game is really charming. 

Turns can be fast, but if players have too much AP it starts to drag at 4.  At 2 players some aspects feel imbalanced, but very quick moving.  3 is probably the sweet spot.  Wasn't expecting a worker placement, but the way everything works together is very interesting and fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The gameplay, in-and-of-itself mediocre, is marred by two big issues:

1. The game rewards first place for doing well, thereby further extending first place's lead. The gameplay tends to snowball quite hard for a game that isn't an engine builder or economics game. If you fall behind, it's pretty much impossible to catch up, even if you play extremely well afterwards.

2. The game was clearly designed with specific strategies in place. In fact, the game leaves little room for a tactical mix-and-match style of gameplay. Instead, it forces you to find a predefined strategy and commit to it, making the game feel "same-y" very fast when the same strategies appear game after game.

Fun worker placement/area control/resource management hybrid game. It blends all three pretty well. I like this much more than Above and Below. A little luck with the dice rolling in combat which I enjoy for the most part and some ways to mitigate that luck. The components are solid. I however am not a fan of the art at all. Very easy to learn and picking it up is not difficult for first timers.

2-4 players take command of a ship and crew. You sail to island towns, collecting resources, hiring crew, and commissioning buildings for your capital city. Each building has a unique ability, and your combination of buildings can greatly enhance your strength as a trader, builder, or invader. You also recruit pirates and sea monsters to conquer towns, which, once conquered, allow you to complete the town action for free, and charge a fee to opponents if they want to use it. Alternatively, you can complete events that give influence, which can be used to befriend towns.

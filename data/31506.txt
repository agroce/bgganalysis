There are many games of this type, but unique is that you have to stay below a certain limit to score points. If you go beyond, you don't score points at all.

Cute little trick taking game.  The trick is that you can set a variable barrier each of the first four rounds.  Go over it and you don't get any points.  So people try to take enough points up to the limit without going over.  You can play one quick round with kids, or multiple rounds and add up the score.

Now that I've played it, I can see that you want to hold at least some of your high goat cards until the end to try to throw opponents over the limit.

Nothing earth shattering here, but has good graphics and plays well with 6.

It is faster than its cousins, 6 Nimmt and Geschenkt. But not that good. But very quick. OK filler.

Revised after more plays: It is good, because there is a tension in what strategy you have to choose. And you can really toast your opponents from time to time. And the "geeple" is so cool!

Light trick taking game with a little twist - there is a bunch of these around. Nice graphics but still I think this is not going to be a favorite of mine.

Edit: After the second game I'll cahnge my opinion a bit. There is definitely some tactics in the game which makes it much more interesting. Game feels a lot like 6 Nimmt and if that's a game you like Ziegen Kriegen will probably also fit into your taste.

Interesting game.  The hill building element appears to be an attempt to balance out getting a lot of low cards (because the low-card player gets to choose the size of the hill card) but to me getting a bunch of low cards isn't bad.  It's getting a bunch of high cards that is usually doomed to failure because you will take too many goat heads and there is nothing you can do about it.

Odd that the game does not scale with players, so if you play with 6 most people will score each hand whereas if you play with 3 it is more of a challenge to not "go over" and take too many goat heads.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Cute little trick taking game.  Each round you are vying for tricks which net you some goats for you island.  The trick is that each round the island can only support a certain number of goats.  If you get too many goats you bust and score nothing!  Kind of samey when compared to other trick taking games out there, but the twist on the island limits makes it a little different and fun.

If you enjoy games in the weight category of [thing=929][/thing] or [thing=215][/thing], you will like this one (but it's worth to note that this one is nothing like these two, and much quicker than either of them).

Components: Clear numbers and goat icons. The artwork is amusing, but also leads to people inadvertently revealing the contents of their hand when they mention a funny goat in their hand, and I'm holding the same picture.

Experience: Better than I thought it would be. Having a few low cards to be able to help guide the limit number is a big plus, and having a range of cards to allow for flexibility is also helpful. Half of this game is luck-of-the-draw, but the other half is amusing hand management.

Trick taking card game with cute art by Michael Menzel.  

A nice Mechanic of determining the winning conditions:  There are 8 rounds and during the first 4, those winning the tricks determine the size of the hill in a rather clever build.  All the cards won and to be won, have a differing number of goats.  A player automatically loses if he collects more goats than the size of the hill.  Those closest to the size of the hill win.  So, a player has half the game to try to adjust his herd.

Lots of luck with not much control.  But since it is quick with really easy rules, it's a fun filler.

Since I am evaluating potential travel cards, this one qualifies--small card box.  Requires minimum of 3 people but can be played on an airplane tray.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8

RATING: 7.5
Kifejezetten szórakoztató, gyors ütésívvős játék. Két csavar van benne igazából: 
1. a kártyáknak van ütésértéke és pontozási (kecske) értéke is. A kettő nincs semmilyen kapcsolatban egymással.
2. A játék végén van egy limit, ami menet közben alakul csak ki. Ha valakinek ennél több pontja van az kiesett. Akinek a legtöbb pontja van a limit alatt, az nyert.

Igazából teljesen nem sikerült megfejteni. Vannak érzéseim, hogy mikor mit érdemes csinálni, de meg tudnám magyarázni az ellenkezőjét is. Szóval azért vannak döntések, de jókat is lehet mulatni egy-egy durvább körön.

-> 7.5

RATING: 5
A very quick and simple trick-taking game. It provides a reasonable amount of depth for such a short game - provided you don't play with too many players and card values are relatively evenly distributed. It is, however, easily possible to get lopsided hands where you don't have any influence on the outcome at all and just wait for the game to be played out.

Very interesting trick taking game. I'm not much for trick taking games, but I like this very much. Maybe it's the goat meeple, but it's the game too. 

You get 8 cards in hand and you want to win tricks to get bull heads (points) that are displayed on the cards. But, within the first 4 rounds of trick taking a hill will be formed with a goat on it with a sum of numbers. That sum is the decisive factor, as you have to be as close with your points to that sum as you can to win. If you go above that sum, you lose. If you're below it, you must have the highest number of points to win. Easy. Now, the hill is built by the person who played the lowest card in the first 4 tricks. So as someone takes the bull heads, the other person can screw with them and throw off their whole points balance. Very neat and funny way to play "god" for others. And that's really the whole game.

Easy, quick, cute goat pictures on the cards, what's not to like?? Plus it's made by Amigo and it's cheap. Get it. You'll like it.

A great light, easy-to-learn card game. Kind of a cross between trick-taking and blackjack -- you're trying win tricks to collect cards to get the most points each round, but you'll bust (0 points) if you go over a certain number, and that number is determined by the players in the first 4 hands of each round. Always funny when someone busts, and plenty of schadenfreude if you can help make that happen. 

You can play one round for a very quick filler, or rounds equal to the number of players, which is my preference. Bears some similarity to 6 Nimmt, but is a bit less about the double-guessing/mind-reading and more about hand management.

Detailed simulation of fighting between two herds of goats? Er no, the goat theme is utterly irrelvent. It is however a fun trick taking game in which the winner is the person with the largest points haul. It has a pontoon/vingt-et-un twist in that all scores that exceed a value set by the players themselves in the first half of the game are void (like going bust in pontoon).

Not stellar, but enjoyable.

RATING: 6
Extremely simple filler with extremely simple rules that can be a good gateway for those who are used to traditional card games. There isn't much skill involved, but it isn't completely random and interesting enough to keep you focused on the game.

The rules are pretty simple: each player is dealt 8 cards, each with a number of goats and a card value. Each round every player plays a card, highest value wins and takes all the goats. At round five and later, the player who has played the lowest value card draws an island card and merges it to what's already in the island the way he likes. When everyone has ran out of cards, the size of the island is checked: everyone who has more goats looses automatically and the winner is the remaining player with the higher number of goats.

So, as you can see, the game is extremely simple. Thankfully, it's engaging and can be very good as a gateway game or as a kids game, but most likely it will be far too simple for true gamers. The production is great, as the cards are sturdy and lovely illustrated, which always is a good thing. The wooden goat isn't necessary at all, but it's cute nevertheless.

I really think there are some balance issues here.  I would offer to add a tiebreaker/variant rule that:  in the event that no one wins (all are tied losers), the person who accumulated the most goatheads wins - this is theoretically the person with most tricks.  I would also suggest that fewer cards be used and the deck should be scaled to the number of players (depending upon the group's taste on card randomness).  I think I would rather be playing Drahtseilakt (aka Tightrope).

RATING: 3
Harmless little card game but relatively luck filled and ultimately not all that much to write home about.  Each round contains 8 tricks.  For the first four tricks, the lowest card in each trick develops the island which provides knowledge of how many points is the limit.  Whoever goes over that limit automatically loses.  Whomever is closest without going over wins.  Each person counts up the number of goat heads on their cards.  Simple and easy - plays in 10 minutes.

Rather disappointing with six players, where there are enough points in a trick that getting one might push you over the edge and getting two almost certainly will. I feel that younger trick-taking games should be polished to a point where you can't get hands that make it impossible to win, but this is what can and will happen here. I'd like to try again with fewer players, but won't touch it again with six.

Lányok az első Kecskefogó játékuk során sosem a játékkal foglalkoznak, hanem azzal, hogy "Jaaaj ez milyen cukiiii!!". Az, az, de nem játszhatnánk?
Egyébként egy aranyos, kis kitöltő játékról van szó a Vigyáz(z)6! és Nincs kegyelem! vonalon. A játék erénye az illusztrációkon túl az első 4 fordulós hegyépítés, ami egy kis plusz taktikai elemet visz a játékba, no meg a kis fakecske, aminek a látványon túl sok értelme nincsen, de jól mutat a hegyen.

The added control / pseudo-bidding gives it an edge over simpler games.

The proper spectrum to put it on is No Thanks / Category 5 / Hearts, not Spades / Mu / Tichu / Njet. 

It is a short dodge-the-bullet kind of game, but with some tweaking options.

While this one might seem a bit light at first, there's considerable complexity hidden underneath - you really have to think your decisions through if you want to win, and it's not as luck-driven as one should think at first glance. It will take a few plays to really "get" the mechanics and develop a strategy, though. This, coupled with the short playing time and the almost complete lack of downtime makes for a quite addictive game. Recommended!

It's a very simple trick-taking game with 8 cards in hand and 8 rounds. Basically there is just one land of 1-50 (but cards have different amounts of goatheads between 1-5) and your goal is to get as many goatheads without getting over a limit. Limit is determined by sum of 4 cards and player with lowest card in first 4 tricks gets to draw a card and choose between two numbers on it. 

There is plenty of luck involved in one round so you might want to play several for a bit more serious game. Unfortunately the game doesn't scale very well nor doesn't work very well as a serious game with any number of players. Works as a (bad) supershort filler. The goat meeple is cute and is actually the best there was in the box.

Highly, highly luck-dependent.  One possible solution would be this: At the beginning of the game, deal 8 cards to each player, as usual.  Then, as the tricks are played, each player keeps his cards separate.  Some other method (counters or score track) is used to track number of goats won in the tricks.  When the round ends, collect your original 8 cards and pass your hand to the player on your left.  The game is over when you've played every hand once.  Like Zum Kuckuck, this would insure (at least somewhat) that getting a lousy deal won't cripple you; every player has to play both the good and bad hands at some point.  

In any case, I suspect Zum Kuckuck will still prove a vastly superior game.

RATING: 7
Fun with the kids (9/7 years old). Plays in 15m or so. You have to have the highest number of points that is still below the threshold. And the threshold is dynamically determined in the first four turns. Often I try to be really smart and stay just under the threshold, but I trip up and go over the threshold, and thus lose the game. Which is nice, because then one of the kids gets to be the gloating victor.

Ziegen Kriegen -- 

Played twice; three- and four-player.  I liked it better at four players.

With three players, more than half the deck went unused, making card distribution too chaotic for my taste.  

In our first round, I had lots of high cards with lots of point symbols.  So even if the island turned out to be quite large, it was unlikely I would be able to unload enough points to stay under the limit.  And of course, with all those high cards, I couldn't influence the size of the island — that requires playing the lowest card in a trick.  (The one time I managed it, the island card which was revealed had only low numbers.)

In other words, luck of the draw is inordinately powerful in Ziegen Kriegen.  That would be less vexing if the game lasted long enough to balance out, but with only one round per player it doesn't.

Still, (after all that whining) it's fun!  And quick.  Plus, the whimsical artwork adds a lot of enjoyment. 

I may not be likely to suggest [thing=31506]Ziegen Kriegen[/thing], but I'm very likely to agree to it when someone else makes the suggestion.

Egyértelműen nagy játékosszámnál működik jól a Kecskefogó, ami egy nagyon egyszerű, könnyed kis kártyajáték. Kecskefejeket gyűjtünk, amelyekből 1-5-ig szerepelhet egy kártyán. A ki visz többet célt egy nagyon kis egyszerű mechanizmus bonyolítja meg. Egy sziget épül a játék folyamán, amelynek négy sarka négy számot tartalmaz. Ennek összege fölé nem mehet a játék végén a játékosoknál található kecskefejszám. Tehát jól kell belőni mennyit gyűjtünk. 10-20 perces játék, bármikor elővehető, de nagy kihívást nem jelentő kártyajáték.

The game "works".  If you use the rules, there are no problems getting it to play out until you finish the game.  I wanted to think that there was something more to this game, but I just didn't get it. It seems that the game should be very clever, but as you play out your hand it really feels that you are often making some really pointless decisions, resulting in someone winning to everyone's surprise.  

The big honkin' problem with this game is that if you win tricks you must lead.  Because there is such a huge spread on the cards (1-50) while still having a significant number still in the deck, people will have lopsided hands without being able to recognize what their hand's relation could possibly be to the other players.  When you lead, unless you play one of the lowest three numbers that are not in your hand you can get stuffed with points.  If you get stuffed you must lead again, etc. In a four player game at minimum you earn 4 goat heads.  Of course, those that played the lowest cards will be inclined to chose lower numbers for the island, making the ever-leading player max out, with nothing interesting to do for the rest of the round.  If the lead player does try to screw others at this point it just becomes kingmaking.

Or, you can get lucky and no one can have cards under yours, or is feeling daring/stupid and tries for the lead.  

If the lowest were the lead and the winner chose the island it might make things a bit closer to a game where you are making worthwhile decisions.  Or at least aren't just playing to see what happens.

Also, while the Schnauzer/Goat is cool it is as pointless as the rest of the game.

Perhaps if take out the top 10 cards and build two islands where the goat jumps back and forth when you build and only counts the island that he is on, the game might be more intriguing.

I'm not willing to buy this and redesign it though.

Decent trick-taking game. Well, it's not really trick-taking, as there are no suits, trumps and so on. It reminded me more of Turn the Tide, except that everybody plays his card in turn. This gives big screwage potential, but there's still some control involved. Played only once, liked it, would play again.

RATING: 8
this is quick, and plays very smoothly--great for teaching the fundamentals of trick taking, as both taking and ducking play equal parts.  No suits or trumps to worry about.Has a brilliant take-that mechanism with a few of the cards (the 10 in particular) which are fantastic for pushing that special someone over the edge into the no-point realm!

Oh yeah, we only play with 3 or 4--I can definitely see how this would seem extremely out-of-player-control with more.  But with 3 or 4 it is very controllable, very solid.

The group that plays this is made up of very serious card players--we have umptillion games of Tichu, 500, 80-point Tractor, Sieben Siegel, and Bridge between us.  This game is seriously good when played with 3 or 4--don't let the naysayers below confuse you.  Either that or you have to be a serious card-player to see the real beauty of this game?

RATING: 5
[Amigo 'Ziegen kriegen' 2007 edition] {Animal; trick-taking, set-collection; optimal 6p} ZK is a lightweight trick-taking game with a novel scoring system for families. It's quite luck dependent because one's decisions are constrained by the initial hand and revealed island cards.  The primary controls are to avoiding getting cards with many goat heads if one is near the limit. However, it's not easy to determine whether a card can win or lose because some cards are missing and the range of cards is too board (1-50). In all, ZK is not tactical trick-taking game but it's quite fun and good enough to be a family card game.

The illustration is cute. The wooden sheep is nicely made. It's a nice produced game.

It is similar to Auf falscher Fahrte but I like Auf falscher Fahrte more.

Light trick-taking game, with some scope for clever play. The max-point mechanic is interesting. It can radically alter your strategy for the hand, depending on its max.

As trick taking games go, this one is pleasant. Standard tricks are played with high card taking the trick and starting the next hand. The twist: the lowest card played for the first four hands get to draw from a pile of cards, each showing two values. The player picks one of two values and the sum total of the four values in the first four hands will determine the upper limit of the total points collected at then end of each round. If the total points collected breach the limit, then the player gets 0 points. Anything below the limit is counted as a positive score. Players play four rounds and the combined score is calculated with the highest score being crowned winner. As mentioned previously, from the perspective of someone who is not keen on trick-taking games, Ziegen Kriegen is.....pleasant. A decent diversion from the regular heavy Euros but not filling enough to be the main course for the evening. I would brand it a filler, except four rounds seem a little long for a filler in my book. Nothing wrong with the game, but if you happen to pass by and miss it, don't worry, there are other good games out there.

One thing I love, the art is really great! Who doesn't like goats?

The island building aspect for the first 4 tricks is a nice mechanism to set up scoring maximums of the round (8 tricks total)

Lots of strategy and tension as to what cards you will play in your hand and as you decide whether or not you want the trick.  If you go over the goat limit(each card has a number of goats on them) on the island you get 0 points.

Best if played to a point total of like 40 or 50.

Trick-taking game that does not utilize the full deck results in randomness that makes the gameplay unpredictable.

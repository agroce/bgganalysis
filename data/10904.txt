R. Wayne Schmittberger's quintessential volume on "variants".  There are some neat little gems hidden in here that bring freshness to some very stale games.

Next to Sackson's Gamut of Games, this was my second most-loved book about games.  It took both old classic games and newer "classics" and breathed new life into them, and did give a few tips on the topic of game design.  This was where my love of Chess variants first began.

A handy little compendium of house rules and variants.

A must-own title for game designers...this book is all about re-thinking 'classic' (old-school) American games and things like Chess to make them more interesting, more strategic, less luck-based...in other words, more Designer-style and better. If you want to design games, the thought process described in this book is worth the price. Find a copy.

An interesting collection of games, including the connection game octagons. Unfortunately seems to be out of print.

Not so many new games, but a good starting point for thinking about rule changes to make your games better for you.

A classic.  As a side note, this is the book that got my friend Kevin Nunn (Nobody But Us Chickens) into game design in the first place.

What a collection of game rules and game variants! This book should be in your collection (and, yes, I do say that about a lot of books. However, I mean it every time.....) My favorite game/variant from the book? A tie between Racing Kings and Philosopher's Football.

Wayne Schmittberger is a longtime associate of Games Magazine. It's a lot of fun to tinker with games to see how they change. This book is excellent and this book will open a gamer up to new possibilities and ideas.

Very good reading, and I'm glad that even outdoor games like croquet and Kickball Golf were mentioned.  There are many intriguing variations given for standard (cheap) games such as chess, checker, and mancala, as well as new games that can be played with those pieces, making this book a cheapskate's dream.

A good resource.  The description of kickball golf is a little sad.  But then, there is disk golf...

This book is awesome. More than just descriptions of rules for games, but not a strategy guide either. You can see some of the author's thinking of what makes a game [i]good[/i], which goes into his suggestions of how to make specific games [i]better[/i]. I consider this essential.

You owe it to yourself to have this fine book on your game shelf.  It will give you lots of ideas for your own variants for many styles of games.  Plus, it's a good read.

You might call this A Manual Of Mechanics. Some interesting ideas (some a bit unoriginal) and well worth a flick through if you're short of choice or can't decide what to play.

Great book. Scratches the itch that Gamut of Games leaves behind after you've read it so many times, you've memorized it.

RATING: 6.5
Some good stuff.  Not too much I actually felt the desire to play, but solid and well-written.  The best thing (that I remember, at least) was the "retreat" rule for Risk.  And a neat deterministic rule for resolving Risk combat, that I used to play a Diplomacy-like "written orders" variant of Risk.

A great collection of variants for well known games and some new games using existing components (or cometimes a new board.)

This book has inspired me to think about how game mechanics are constructed, and how they can be modified. That's only a small portion of the book, but the number of chess and checker variants included riffs on that theme for me.

Perfect book to suit my personality. Tinkerers unite!

It's the idea that once a game belongs to you, you can change it to suit your needs. One reason that board and card games are better than computer games (some computer games let you change the "boards", but not the rules).

Some interesting and fun variants, mixed with some that don't seem to have been playtested.

Extremely cool book about alternate ways to play and think about classic games.  Will make you make your own boards and pieces, and raid various games to get bits to play other games differently.

Good dumb fun. It's mechanically simple and may disappoint people used to more serious skirmish games or wargames but if you just want to run around and blast things for a change then this is great. Vaguely Lovecraft-themed.

Fun and cool theme, but a bit long at times. Plan to get a transparent hex grid overlay for it, and use hexes instead of inches to speed things along.

RATING: 6
A fun, luck-of-the-roll miniatures game. The first few games are pretty enjoyable, but after about 4 playings, it seems to have lost its cheesy allure, which I guess means it has a limited replay value.

Great, fun game. Quick for a miniatures game. A bit long on initial set-up (all pieces must be cut out with scissors). Definitely not for rules lawyers. Does not actually have the "nitpicky" rules it claims in the instruction manual. All in all, though, a great time.

I thought it was fun, and liked the theme, and the art was well done, but the fact you needed to cut out the mini's and tape a penny to it to keep it from moving sort of lost people when they played it.  Nice premise, almost a good production.  Probably never played again.

RATING: 1
Dull as a rusty pair of pinking shears. Plagued by long turns, overall boring and predicatable continuous D20 based combat. It's worth noting that after our first, 3 player session 1 of the 3 players (not me) was at least on the 'liked' it end of things, after a second (with 4 players, the 4th player changing twice and finally being controlled by us to finish the game!) the player who liked it no longer did, and those of us who thought it was mediocre decided that it was utter crap. The theme is great, but not enough to conceal the horrible play.

Excellent game. It would've been nice if the markers were plastic minis rather than cardboard cut-out standees, though.

A fun light tabletop game with a theme that I love! Not very difficult to pick up and if you have any other tabletop mini game experience this is a breeze. mutant hillbillies racing to grab the necronomicon while destroying each other in bizarre ways. It's a hoot to play if you enjoy the theme and game genre.

Fun game, but adding a grid would really have much improved the game length as movement is really kind of fiddly.
It is well worth checking out the files from Lucrada to pimp your game. Kudos to him for his great work :)

Why the tape measures? This game should have been on a square of hex map. The tape measures add to the fiddly nature of this game and along with the prett poor components really drag down what should have beena  really fun game.

Lovecraft spoof theme around a fast-paced, bloody miniatures-light game.  I don't know if it is for everyone, but I have a blast with it and so has everyone I've been able to talk into playing.  Rare and not-well-known absolute gem of a game.

Again, my love for HPL probably biases my opinion on this one. I like it. Alot of bits to find homes for though, and a bit of a make work project with all the cutting out of pieces. I wonder if the re-animator expansion from years ago will ever see the light of day.

Not my kind of game.  I got this too late in my gaming journey.  My interest in dungeon crawls had passed by the time I got ahold of this.

Nevertheless, if you do like duneon-crawl games, this may be the game for you.  Especially if you are a fan of the Cthulhu Mythos.

Game is lots of fun, but is a little too long and complicated for the payoff. Still, how can any self-respecting Lovecraft fan not like a Cthulhu-themed game whose tagline reads "A Frenzied Fury of Hillbilly Horror!"?

A very cool idea, but it's very clunky.  The art and the basic idea of the game are delicious, but it's much like somebody took a d20 campaign and tried to package it in a boardgame (perhaps that was the idea?)  There's a lot of looking up in tables and books for things.  If it was tidied up, it could be a lot of fun.   Also, the game is basically a wargame, and there is little beyond the killing of the other team(s) going on, so it winds up a race/battle which is not very genre.  Could use a lot of help, but I still love it =)

RATING: 7
This is an imaginatively designed little minis game with some very attractive components and a lively, entertaining rulebook. It's stats-intensive enough to engage the mind without being overweight, and the characters are just different enough to give it some real flavor. Gameplay is badly flawed, though - after the "great seal" is found the last 40% of ost every session becomes a huge clusterf**k, as characters throng around whoever's got the Necronomicon and melee tediously until somebody gets a good die roll or two and manages to break free. The game is a badly missed opportunity that could have been much better if the authors had just learned a few simple lessons from the people who do level design on mediocre computer RPGs.

RATING: 7
A must own for fans of H.P. Lovecraft and Call of Cthulhu, this miniatures game combines a wicked sense of humor with enjoyable (if occasionally confusing) game play. The instructions can be occasionally confusing and circular (example: special abilities have only a few lines of text in the instructions, and refer to the character sheets for clarifications ... but if you have a question about a character, you're out of luck). Still, it's a game we like to play every year or two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A real fun game, but it can take a while to play.  The nice thing is that it's a miniatures game that is relatively easy to learn and with the random tile setup the game has a fun feel to it with each new game.  My biggest wish would be to see more support for this game - a re-release would be good.  Expansions would be awesome!

Eh.  I was bored through most of this game, which was a combination of die-rolling and watching other people rolling dice.  Not much strategy, and it took a long time.  Yawn.  Fun theme, though, and I suppose I could be dragged into a game by enthusiastic friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game, especially if you like "miniatures-type" war games.  Based on H.P. Lovecraft's works.  You definitely don't want to take this game too seriously--it's supposed to be lighthearted and funny.  The main problem is, for a light game, it's way overlong...we played recently and a four-player game took five hours to play.  It starts to get pretty tedious after the the third hour.  One possible improvement might be to play with four or five characters each instead of all six.

RATING: 10
I love this game. Pure Ameritrash gold, with lots of drama, dice-rolling, violence, theme, conflict and even player elimination. The rules are intuitive and easy to learn, and the game moves along at an entertaining pace. Darkly humorous, and with good replay value, too. I only wish that Pagan had managed to publish a couple of sequels, because this game would be even more fun (and chaotic) if it scaled up to six players.

H.P. Lovecraft's evil inbred rural magician New England clans as a tabletop war game?  Strange as it sounds it's pretty fun.  Fight it out for Wizard Whately's Necronomicon and summon your favorite Great Old One.  Of course, it might eat you.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The theme is sort of a weird mix of goofy (in a good way) and horror, what with various mutated redneck hillbilly clans and cults fighting it out to the death over the necronomicon.  It's been a long while since I had a chance to play this, but I enjoyed it.  Basically, it plays as a moderately fiddly Cthulhu themed tabletop miniatures game (with nicely done cardboard stand-ups) on a small town battlefield made up of attractive cardstock tiles but unfortunately with no grid nor game spaces printed on them - you have to use a ruler for movement.  That's my only big complaint against the game.  I really have to be in a certain mood to want to deal with rulers and measurements, especially for a game where a square grid could have been added so easily.

It's a terrible pity they never came out with the Herbert West expansion.

Probably a good intro to miniature gaming, it even comes with its own tape measure.  Simple and steeped in a violent them world, this alone might put off some players.  Yet it still has its own following.  I may trade mine away at some future point for someone to appreciate it more than I do.

{First Play}
Pretty fun and brutal game as has been said already.
I've pimped the game a bit with some extra bits to make the bookkeeping a bit less time consuming.

Nevertheless we had fun with this one. if you can look past the basic components (even though the artwork is pretty good) and/or are willing to adjust some things, you will too :).

Big thanks to Lucrada who has created and uploaded some great things to improve the gameflow.

{Second Play}
Again, this was a brutal slugfest with all 4 factions. Still fiddly, but working on that :)

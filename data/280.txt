RATING: 10
Yay!! Just hannibal vs Rome by itself merits a 9. I would rate the other games in the set also between 6 and 9. For me this makes the overall packet a 10 because of the fairly high quality variety it provides with a lot of reusable components. If I were to be marooned on an island and was constrained for space, NSimAR will be my first pick for this reason alone.

Rating is for the ever popular Circus Maximus chariot race game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium.

RATING: 9
Amazing storybook! I think it is even better today as a historiographic event. First: it is easy to be seduced by Knizia's mathematical genius. Second: You can see the core mechanics that are used later in his games. Third: The compilation itself.
Anyone who likes game theory (and we all do, don't we?)and have read books from Axelrod, Rapoport must be impressed.

Rated for Circus Maximus only - a decent, quick, light game; but not much to it. Not played the others.

RATING: 3
Components: Nice artwork on the cards. The board is all sepia tones and hexagons, but there are some nice details around the periphery.

Experience: (Circus Maximus) Very quick, and purely strategic with two. I might enjoy this with more players, but with two my mind didn't feel up to the challenge of outwitting my opponent.

Hard to rate as this is a compendium of 14 different games by Knizia themed on Ancient Rome.  Some excellent games (Senator, Imperium) and average ones also.  Some of these games came back as other games (Mercator -&gt; Medici) and so on.  Certainly worth picking up - and try to find the separate published rule book (and I do mean book) by Reaching Moon Megacorp.

Some reasonable games in this early Knizia collection, but none come close to being top rate in my view.

RATING: 7
For all the plays I got out of this I should probably give it a 10. I've even reconstructed and rethemed some of the games as gifts to friends. I especially like the games "Hannibal gegen Rom", "Prokonsul" and "Tribunal". Theme is thin on most, but on the other hand, I certainly find the attempt to make such a number of games fit the most important Roman historical eras laudable.

A bit dry and divorced from the themes, as you might expect, but a solid collection of games. The Rome vs. Carthage game is a two-player masterpiece, playable in minutes, allowing you to play again, and again, modifying your strategy to reflect what your opponent just did... but so does she!

RATING: 6
A compendium of Roman themed games by Reiner Knizia. A few of these later became stand alone games. All in all there are 14 different games which take you through some of the major periods of Roman history or civilisation. Some are very good and some are very poor but there is something for everyone here!

TRIBUNAL:
Legal game that relies upon voting for or against certain cases. Can be a longish game and roleplay definitely needed!

・元老院議員/6点

カエサル二倍ルール推奨。

・ローマ対ハンニバル/9点
シンプルでテーマ性に優れ、駆け引きもあり、短時間で終わるわりにリプレイバリューもある。
大枠はアブストラクトだけどブラフの要素もあり読み切ることは出来ないので気楽に楽しめる。

・ローマの七丘/6点
先手が有利なので二回やって先手後手を入れ替えて合計点を競うのがおすすめ。

Rating based on Wheel of History and Circus Maximus.  Both of these are very entertaining games.  Usually this type of idea falls flat on its face, but I know that at least a couple of these are solid.  Thematically flimsy, but rather intriguing game system.

I purchased the English manual from Esdevium Games.

This is a hard one to rate.  14 different games in the box.  None of them are all that complex, and all of them are rated as taking 30 minutes or less to play.

Imperium is a fun "Influence" type game that plays in about 10 minutes.  Circus Maximus is a good chariot race.  And I have some I still need to try.  Some look a bit weak, but one never knows until you've tried, eh?

The idea of the game kit really appeals to me.  Since most of the games play in 10 minutes or so, I see this as a nice filler game, while waiting on folks to arrive for game nights.

I am very fond of this anthology of little games, one of the prizes of my collection, and worth every pricey penny. Love the early 90s, no-frills, German game look of the double-sided game boards and cards. Have played eleven of the fourteen games (all but Conspiracy, Proconsul, Tribunal--I know, the latter two are probably among the best in the box).

Five favorites: Caesar, Circus Maximus, Hannibal v. Rome, Senator, Spartacus. [25 plays]

A good game that I never, ever win: Imperium. [10 plays]

Two okay games that we've played a lot: The Praetorians, The Wheels of History [13 plays]

Three not so hots: Seven Hills of Rome, Consul, Mecator (prototype for Medici). [6 plays] 

[54 total plays]

I love this compendium and always bring it to the gaming session. Many people complain about components but I actually like the simplicity of brown boards. I have tried all 14 games. They are all great games. Mostly short games with just enough tactics. My favorites are Hannibal vs Rome, Imperium, Circus Maximus, Tribunal, The Catiline Conspiracy.

The Wheel of History: Played 4-player games several times. Modified and publised as Bunte Runde.

The Seven Hills of Rome: Quick 2-player card game. Face-down cards, No consecutive moves to the same hill, and First-player tie-break all works well. Barricade variant is also good. Republished as Kubra's Gambol and Cordoba.

Consul: Memory meets auction. Unique. Republished as Sokrates.

Senator: 2-player abstract that feels a bit like Gipf.

Hannibal vs Rome: Probably the one that I played most in this box. Great short war game for 2 players. Republished under the same name in Rome. Reworked as LOTR:Confrontation.

Proconsul: Played few times with 4 and 5. Interesting negotiation/area control game.

Caesar: Multi-player War-like game with the twist of placement and bluff. Republished as Fish Eat Fish.

Spartacus: Abstract trick-taking-ish game. Interesting design. Republished as Ohio with slight modification.

Tribunal: Most gamers game in this set. Brutal negotiations are possible. Works ok with 6 or 7 but probably best with 5.

The Catiline Conspiracy: Very good (and underrated) deduction game. Short and clever.

Imperium: This is the game that I played 2nd most number of times in this set. Good for 3-5 players. Republished in Rome with some modification that I think these new elements are unnecessary.
 
The Praetorians: Push-your-luck game that works alright. This was the last game I played in this set. Reworked as Zirkus Flohcati and Cheeky Monkey.

Mercator: In-the-fist auction game that is very close to Medici. Quite good. Played with 4-5. 

Circus Maximus: Complete open information racing game. This is one of my favorite racing games. Good with 3-5. Republished in Rome.

The feisty set of games Neue Spiele im alten Rom is a virtuosistic display of Rainer Knizia's talent at varied genres: each of the 14 designs in this set excepting the more complex Prokonsul is based on one or two mechanisms, including auctions (Mercator), negotiation (Tribunal), racing (Circus Maximus), combat (Hannibal gegen Rom), memory (Konsul), positional play (Senator), set collecting (Das Rad der Geschichte), stacking (Caesar), majorities (Imperium), bluff (Die sieben Hügel Roms). trick taking (Spartacus), combinatory thinking (Die Verschwörung des Catilina) and pushing your own luck (Die Prätorianer).

For its quantity, quality and breadth this is Rainer Knizia's true masterpiece. None of these mostly quick and always distilled games is an absolute stunner, but all of them are good or very good and they work better than Knizia's more overloaded creations. Of course the themes are quite thin, but they still fit; the historical context common to all the games and their similar degree of difficulty make the collection feel like a unified whole.

A 1994 compendium of fourteen (!) Knizia games that was only published in Germany and boasts one forum post in the last 12 years 

It has something of the feel of a 'B-sides and rarities' compilation for devoted fans of a musician, full of interesting fragments that later showed up in more developed form. But several are genuinely excellent in their own right. So far I've been most impressed by the wonderfully concise 10-minute area-majority control game Imperium. 

If there's a theme, it seems to be all starting with the same set of resources (rather than randomly dealt) and choosing how best to allocate them. Using just a set of number cards and a few coloured pawns, Neue Spiele goes to show that Knizia was a master of the microgame years before the concept even existed. 

I've played seven of the fourteen so far and am really looking forward to trying the rest, which span diverse styles from negotiation to memory to deduction.

(3 plays)  This is an interesting package of many different pieces for playing a bunch of different games.  We've tried a few of them and none have been too impressive.  The rulebook is the best thing about it, with bits of historical context for all of the games.  While this is a really great package, I just don't see breaking the game out again.

A game box that has many games inside. We just played 1 of the games called Imperium. 15 minute game to play cards from your hand trying to take areas for majorities. You score each land as you go so it is really a bluffing game. It was fun and I would play again. Will not own it.

14 games by Kniza and what must be the world's thickest rulebook: 120pages or so. But what a package! This is worth every penny. I mean, it has Kniza's ONLY deduction game ever.

Published in 2004, several games went on to be republished later on. This is a Knizia game clinic. Only a few designers can lay claim to doing something like this. Sid Sackson probably being the first that jumps to mind.

Had version with massive English rulebook.

Seems like a decent collection of filler games to play.

Wheel of History: Simple yet there are some difficult choices to make.  Do you invest in the same color as other people because it'll be more likely to score or do you start in another because you'll get more points?  Do you take the negative point and end the round now or let somebody else do it?  High chaos factor.  The cards could be better marked because we'd often had to check whether a certain number is the last one out.

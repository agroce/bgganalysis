120102 card game, played once, not sure what to make of it.  I think its a little too complicated, but I may be wrong.  I'll certainly play it again just to see if I missed something (positive or negative).

RATING: 6.5
Played twice and both times I was too keen to side with Rome and both times it just lost by a nose, will try a more straight forward approach next time, more interesting than Biblios which is too much about the auction, this takes the draw three and disperse approach differently. Unsure if it will hold up to multiple plays so I won't buy a copy.

Better than [b]Pergamemnon[/b], this little game still packs a big punch in a small package.  It has some neat ideas, but it's never thrilling.  Just merely decent.  The card layout is really unfortunate, as they prevent stacking when face-up.  I'd play this again, though.

Really bad art, and a fairly light-weight theme.....

.....but a mechanically delightful game! The card-drafting mechanic seems to have been borrowed from Dr. Knizia's game, The Merchants of Amsterdam.

RATING: 6
A very good card game that uses the mechanisms from Biblios but gives another twist of its own with the players also competing against Rome.

RATING: 6
A decent game of set collection.  You gain cards in two ways; by drawing them from the deck and by buying them from a tableau.  Money pays for buying cards and for playing more than one - and it's fairly tight.  

The main novelty in Pax lies in its semi-cooperative nature.  We are all competing with Rome and if we allow it to get too powerful (collect four sets of cards more powerful than ours), only the chief conspirator will win.  Having said that, I have yet to see the conspirator try to engineer a Roman win.  That may just be inexperience.

Artwork is undistinguished, though functional.  The cards are of reasonable quality.  The rules are quite clear and seem complete.

Haven't figured this one out yet.  There's quite a lot going on. Cards move from here to there and back to another place.  A good amount to keep track of.  Feels like there's a really interesting game here.  

However when it comes to my turn I dont really have a good idea of why Im doing what Im doing.  Still waiting for that "Ah HA!" moment.

I'm still looking for a game with a great tech-tree but Pax is not it. Instead of building up on the base game the advancements feel like they got chopped out of it and then being added while playing. Need to play again though.

Update: It reminds a bit of Rapa Nui which I prefer.

Solo play is a little enterntaiment, like an brain excersise, but after a 3 players game the main complain I can make to this game is that between turns you don't have nothing to think so the downtime is very annoying. I supose that this problem increases even more in a 4 players game.

I'm a little disappointed with this game.

Shares similarities with Biblios but has a stronger theme although the art on the cards could be better (more evocative and less cartoony). The hidden information on the three face-down cards means you can't be sure who has won until the very end. The end conditions are interesting and well balanced. Overall a fun game, 3 plays.

A very confusing card game at first. The steps are straight forward and simple but a winning strategy is difficult. There's kind of a cooperative feel to the game because players have to defeat Rome to win, but at the same time it's not. Interesting game and I do like it, more than I thought, and it plays solo.

Unusual semi-co-op in which all the players are playing against Rome.  If Rome wins, everybody loses; if Rome loses, only one player will win.

Many similarities to Bilbios, except this one is heavier and gives you opportunities to build a (very small) engine.  The game seems to end right when it's getting interesting -- I wish it were a round or two longer!

What a clever little card game. I like the part where if you think you're going to lose, you can try to sabotage the game and win that way. However, it happens very late in the game, so it's difficult to pull it off.

A game that will clearly reward multiple plays. It's kind of amazing how much this does with just two types of cards: resources and coins.

Too bad about the cheap card stock and cartoon art. Could have been a keeper...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Somewhat interesting game but far from the brilliance of Peloponnes. I like the three choices you have with your draws each turn but there's too little angst in the game as it seems too easy to defeat Rome. Ok, one player could really go for the red cards and try to boost Rome as much as possible but that's an all or nothing gamble as I see it.

Too much an all or nothing game. If one or two players decide to boost Rome the traitor will win and it's just about getting the most red cards.

Card games are not typically my thing, but this one isn't bad.  It's a set collection game that has some cool mechanics.  Wouldn't seek it out, but would be happy to play it again.  I like that there is a dummy player (Rome) that you have to beat to get more points.  And if Rome does too well, then the victory conditions change...possibly everyone losing.

Az alapbÃ³l majd mindegyik kÃ¡rtyÃ¡ra igaz -alap Ã©s kieg kÃ¡rtya is-, hogy 1 db lejÃ¡tszÃ¡sÃ¡nak nincs tÃºl sok plusz elÅnye. De ha x db-ot tesz le a jÃ¡tÃ©kos: akkor Ã©letbe lÃ©pnek a hatÃ¡sok. (ez az 3 vagy 4 Ã©s annak tÃ¶bbszÃ¶rÃ¶sei)

KÃ­vÃ¡ncsi leszek 5-6-7-8 fÅvel milyen lesz.
Update: 8 fÅvel is kiprÃ³bÃ¡lva. Szerintem Ã­gy is nagyszerÅ±, viszont akkor lehet pÃ¶rgÅs a jÃ¡tÃ©k, ha mÃ¡r ismerik az emberek a lapokat, egyÃ©b esetben tÃºl sok idÅ megy-mehet el arra, h milyen lap ez, h merre. Mert 1 ember kÃ¶re nagyjÃ¡bÃ³l 30 mÃ¡sodpercnyi lehet, ha tudja , h mi mit jelent.

Been a while since I've played this. I remember that it had a similar mechanism to Biblios in that you draw a card and decide what to do with it. If you pick something early, something better could be on the horizon that you can't have, or you can wait and end up with something less good than what popped up earlier. I remember thinking this one was interesting because people could lose against the game. It also had more of a game around it compared to biblios, if I recall correctly. I probably should have given this more a chance but I feel that I like I own other quick 3/4-player that I enjoy more (Stichlen, Ra, etc.). Since I keep my collection trim, this one got lost in the shuffle but I'd happily play it again. I'm rating this the same as Biblios but I think I actually prefer this one... though I've only played this once (at the time of writing this) and Biblios many more. Maybe this wouldn't hold up as well over multiple games. Who knows?

PAX was bought at the recommendation of a geekbud who knows how much I  like Scripts and Scribes (Biblios), and I'm happy to report it did not disappoint. It's from the designer of Peloppones (a game I like), and is similar to Scripts and Scribes in the way you draw and assign three cards one at a time. The game turn is 1) assigning your three cards, 2) playing cards & getting income, and 3) buying new cards, however, you may perform these three actions in whatever order you choose. There are 7 suits of cards, and each one has a special power when played. While you're playing cards for their powers, you're also trying to build up strength in as many suits as possible.

What raises this game above ordinary is that you play against Rome as well as against each other. There are two sets of victory conditions, one for when the players beat Rome and one for when Rome wins, in which case the player highest in the Conspiratio suit (red) wins as the traitor. While the basis of the game is set collection, there are other elements players must consider as to how strong Rome will be at the end of the game and which suits they wish to pursue. It's a card game, so there's some randomness of course, but there's enough going on here to make it strategic.

RATING: 8
Slightly fiddly rules set with the odd hole, but once we got the hang of it, we enjoyed this a lot. Quick to play, we immediately played a second round, which surprised us by Rome winning, and so the traitor won. Good with 2 players, want to try with more. Excellent game, well worth buying. I got mine for â¬12.

Been playing this a bit lately. Still think it's great. very easy engine builder with some group think and/or traitor. Really nice. Get a copy asap.

Getting better and better with more plays. I'm now at seven I believe (2x4p, 5x 2p). This is the game Mystery Rummy wanted to be. 

1) Interesting mechanic for drawing cards at the beginning of the round. Not just "take one card and be happy (or angry)."

2) Playing "the system" (Rome) is much more fun that the Whodunnit mechanic in Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper.

3) Strategic options: Trying to keep the traitor card and winning together with Rome is an option for everyone, not just for one player who happens to have the "The Ripper Escapes" card.

***

Rome doesn't often win if supported by only one player. While this may seem thematically inappropriate, it is necessary for the game to work, else the player with the most red cards would always win.

One more observation: Novice players tend to stack many cards together - to prevent others from buying them. So they go to Rome ... and the player with the most red cards wins. If you're not sure you'll be Primus Conspirator in the end, don't do this! It's better to let others buy cards sometimes, even if those cards fit their strategy.

I think the game itself is worth around 7.5 but the rules makes it lose half a point. I used the French translation at first but there are a lot of typos and the way the rules are written (translated) is really not good enough. I had to rely on the English ones, better. 

Apart from this issue, my wife and I have been enjoying this game quite a lot. We are still wondering if we play it right, though.

I like this card game. From the fun theme (you are an fugitive slave) to the mechanics. It has some interesting decisions (which cards to take, which cards to play, Do I help the group defeating Rome?, or should I try to win via Sabotage?) with a fairly easy rules overhead. It is reminiscent of Biblios (another game I enjoy) but a bit more complex.

Love the semi cooperative feel. Pax has a lot of potential to go up in my personal ratings. For now I want to play again to form a better opinion of the game.

RATING: 6.25
Choose which of destination the three cards you draw one at a time go to, then have the option of buying cards from one location before earning income for what you play in the final phase -- all with the hopes of having more of each category than "Rome" and your opponents. Luck, some strategy, some theme... but the rule book is horribly confusing and the game doesn't really have those moments when opponents are really shifting the tableau as much. (We prefer Biblios as a result.)

PLUS: theme, unique mixture of mechanics
MINUS: playing against deck and opponents really never seems to excite much

A fun filler card game of building majorities in suits. the suits confer game advantages. 
 Suits are compared against Rome at the end of the game whereby all players can lose, or one player can win with Rome by being the biggest traitor.

The game is fun, without being outstanding. Solid.

A good and quick, almost filler like tactical card game with well intermixing mechanisms. Co-op in which everyone is on his own in the end. Nothing to complain really, but possibly lacks some tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Tableau builder where you seek majorities in card categories. On a turn you draw three cards, normally one at a time, and must put one each in a buying pool, in your hand, and back in the deck. Playing cards from your hand to your tableau generates money which is used to improve the rate of card acquisition and placement. Meanwhile the virtual Rome player receives cards from the buying pools, and this is what you're competing against in the solo game. A bit dry, and the nominal theme of a gladiatorial uprising is not felt in the least, but the multiplayer game should be well worth trying.

Competitive card game with a bit of a co-operative element as players all try to be the winner but also make sure that Rome doesn't get the upper hand (and everyone loses). Tableau builder where you are competing in majorities with other players and against the game ('Rome'). Definitely an underrated gem and glad I found a copy.

After 2 plays:

Great "heavy filler".  It's more complicated than Biblios, and you have more control, but it plays in about the same amount of time when everyone knows it.

Unfortunately, the rules are a bit fiddly at first, so it wouldn't be a good non-gamer game, while Biblios shines in that role.  Definitely a keeper.  I'm looking forward to future plays, especially at different player counts to see how that affects Rome's chance of winning.

Rules misprint:  Should be 35 Aurei cards (not 40)

RATING: 6
Mit 30 bis 45 Minuten ein relativ kurzes Kartenspiel mit einem ganz netten Mechanismus, der ganz ordentlich funktioniert. U.a. dadurch kommt ein gewisser Zufallsfaktor ins Spiel, der bleibt dabei aber - so mein bisheriger Eindruck- "beherrschbar" bzw. bleibt das Spiel trotzdem ausreichend ausgewogen.
Fazit: Kein abendfÃ¼llendes Programm aber fÃ¼r zwischendurch sicher ein nettes Spiel.
p.s.: Die Variante zwei Spiele zu kombinieren um mit mehr Spielern spielen zu kÃ¶nnen ist ein nettes Feature, aber das Spiel wird dadurch nur lÃ¤nger und darunter leidet der SpielspaÃ ein wenig. Daher ziehe ich fÃ¼r diesen Fall zwei einzelne Partien vor.

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:  As a solo game, Pax has a bit of an advanced Patience feel to it. You are making sets of cards to have the majority in X of 7 different categories (colors). X increases with each higher difficulty level you are playing.  At the highest difficulty level, you must have the majority in all seven categories. Unfortunately, I discovered that at this highest level, you can actually lose the game during setup...and no one likes that.

So, as I am want to do, I decided to work on my own version of the solo game to see if I could improve a bit on it...or at least make it so you can't lose before you even play your first card. You can check it out [thread=1850239]here[/thread] if you're curious. It's a little fiddly as you have to create the draw deck with an equivalent ratio of colors as the full deck, but I think it works well enough

It's totally a solo puzzle though, as you'll know how many of each color card is in the deck, but you won't know how many symbols of each category (some cards have 1, some have 2). It's a light, puzzly card game for when you want a quick fix. Not bad.

I do wish I had a gaming partner or two as I think this would be an excellent set-collection filler for when the time called for it.

Another fun game introduced by another gamer family while our respective little ones were playing together.

This easy-to-learn card game is a lot of fun and has some really nice components in a sensibly sized box. 

I like how there is the chance that Rome will win (and all players lose if it does) so there is an element of forced co-operation but the rest of the game is a free-for-all with each player trying to get ahead and not leave anything too attractive as âlow hanging fruitâ for the others.

A fantastic little game which hope to play again soon and I will look out for at Cancon.

Juillet 2015, autour de 4 ans aprÃ¨s la sortie de PAX, trÃ¨s peu de joueurs se sont prononcÃ©s quant au nombre optimal de joueurs pour jouer Ã  ce jeu.

1	16.7% (1)	66.7% (4)	16.7% (1)	6
2	20.0% (2)	60.0% (6)	20.0% (2)	10
3	30.0% (3)	70.0% (7)	0.0% (0)	10
4	55.6% (5)	33.3% (3)	11.1% (1)	9

Je dÃ©cide de voter "Best with 1 player" (je suis le premier Ã  le faire) en Ã©tant conscient que je n'ai que 7 parties de jouÃ©es, dont 5 solo, 1 seule Ã  trois joueurs et 1 seule Ã  quatre joueurs.

Mais pour moi, il est clair que le jeu fonctionne parfaitement en solo. Les conditions de victoire diffÃ¨rent des parties multijoueurs, c'est vrai, mais pour moi, cela ne constitue pas un problÃ¨me, au contraire. La partie solo procure beaucoup de plaisir et de rÃ©flexion, et quelques intÃ©ressants dilemmes. 

Certes, certains prÃ©tendent que le jeu est optimal Ã  quatre joueurs notamment parce qu'avec moins de joueurs, certaines cartes sont Ã©cartÃ©es. Mais pour moi, tout le plaisir est lÃ . 

Des parties seront peut-Ãªtre "impossibles" Ã  gagner Ã  cause du contenu alÃ©atoire des 40 cartes utilisÃ©es. Tant pis. Ce jeu, en solo, me rappelle mes parties de "jeu de patience" ou de "solitaire" lorsque j'Ã©tais jeune.

8/10 - voyons si le temps attÃ©nuera mon enthousiasme actuel...

RATING: 8.5
This feels almost like Biblios solitaire variant, with added multiplayer mechanics. Biblios is one of my favourite fillers, so a solo version is much appreciated. The atmosphere is wonderfully tense and there is much to think about. It compares to Onirim in that respect. I haven't yet played multiplayer, but expect good things from that too. I suspect it would take new players a few rounds or games to get the 'feeling' of the game, though, whereas Biblios is instant. However, on later playthroughs, both ought to feel almost equally light, but with PAX offering more to chew on. So.... Biblios is the best filler for new players, and PAX is the best filler for players who are prepared to sacrifice one game just to learn something new.

Take the best part of Biblios (the choices between keep, put in a job lot or discard), throw away the auction, add the option to buy a job lot, add in a special power for each of the 7 types of cards and you get a pretty decent game. Victory points come for playing out lots of different types to your tableau, beating King Lui's table (aka Rome, seeded by the biggest unbought job lot at the end of each round) in each type, plus bonuses per shield/navy symbol (but make it harder to get them out). On top of that, throw in the traitor option to mix things up - if one player beats King Lui in red, and no one beats King Lui in 4 of the 7 types, the traitor auto-wins. All of which makes life interesting. Money is always tight, needing it to both buy cards and to play cards (playing cards then gets some money back, more if you play on a type you have a bunch of cards in). What type of card to specialise in is another consideration - generally once you get enough of 1 type you'll get a privilege (be it bonus points, see more cards, save money when buying, etc). There's not a lot to consider on other players' turns, and there's a bit to consider on yours (re keeping which cards and whether to buy and what then to play) so downtime is a bit of an issue. Hence maybe 3 is better than 4, plus there being a touch less chaos over what cards remain in play. It packs a nice enough punch to see replay though.

RATING: 5
Decent card game with similarities to Biblios.  Joel Eddie even claimed it to be a Biblios killer.  I see he eventually kept Biblios and got rid of this.  Biblios is the better game by far, but I enjoy this one enough to hang on to it.  It does not have an auction, so I can at least play a Biblios styled game with those who do not like auctions.  To elaborate a little more on the two:  Pax does not have nearly as much tension as Biblios and it is less interactive.  There are also more "small" rules making Pax less elegant for a small box card game.  There is fun to be had, however, and I do not regret the small amount of cash spent on it.

UPDATE:  Opinion dropped.  Sold.

RATING: 7
We didn't play this for the longest time... it's such a neat little game, but for 2 player, the game can be unbalanced unless you're careful about how you remove cards. 

Our house rules are: Play by the normal rules, but don't remove 20 random cards from the deck. Instead, for 2 player, remove one (1 coin) and one (3 coin)  card from each of the seven suits for a total of 14 cards removed. Randomly removing cards can yield weird games because removing too many low-cost cards can cause the game to be very slow at the start, removing too many high-cost cards can cause money to be too plentiful which leaves the center perpetually empty during the time when players should be building their engine and suits. Removing too many of one suit can produce particularly odd results (removing too many forests, for example, means that both players either have to go after military which tends to starve players for money early in the game leading to a slow or uneven start - or be unable to build ships or troops)

Anyway - long story short - just remove a 1-coin and a 3-coin from each suit for a very fun and balanced 2p game. Perhaps randomly removing cards leads to interesting corner-case games and some people would prefer that, but we like it with our house rules.

This is a pretty fun game with a mechanic that looks a little like Biblios initially, but does not really have the same feel when played.  This game is a little more complicated than Biblios and it is still debatable if it is a good complication or not.  I do like the depth, personally, but not everyone I've played this game with has shared that opinion.  At least 2 of every 3 other players have noted they preferred the simplicity of Biblios.

Somewhat longish card game for the first time and the rules are a bit chore to explain to new players. It didn't seem like an optimal game for random sessions with different players.

Our scores were very close in the first game.)  The decisions seem interesting - but I'd love to see someone go for the traitor victory.  Definite possibility of rating rising on further play.

What a pleasant suprise this has turned out to be. This is a really well designed little game. It has a lot of things that I like. Set collection, bluffing, semi co-op traitor in a really clever way, and excruciatingly important use of timing. The artwork is cartoonish but pretty, and it plays pretty quick. I agree with others that it's a meatier Biblios.

If you're a fan of Biblios then you will probably enjoy this. It takes the core card selection mechanic from that game (admittedly the discarded card doesn't take part in any auction portion of the game), and adds basic character roles and some interesting allocation decisions. You're collecting sets, but they're sets with meaning as most will generate some benefit or ability. All the way you're looking at maximising your points, chiefly through diversification and specialisation, while collectively beating Rome in four of seven areas. Meanwhile one or more players may be potentially looking to sabotage the group effort, but not at too great a cost to their overall points score lest Rome be defeated and they don't win via the back door. Along the way you make decisions regarding where you want to invest and earn income. It's a light and quick game with decisions coming back to each player frequently. You have to keep an eye out on what other players are doing, how you want to distribute cards, etc. It's easy to teach, fast to play, nicely produced and allows flexible player numbers. A fun little card game which I'm probably ranking a bit too high here, but I'm a sucker for the theme and a good quick game that has some interesting medium weight decisions in it.

Played with four and found it drags a bit compared to two or three players. I think three is the sweet spot.

Interesting how well the land and conspirators restrict your Legion and Navis building. How if you can't grab the necessary land then your only other option to build legions and navis is to invest in conspirators. How conspirators seem to pop up near the end of the deck. Does anyone want to change tack and sabotage proceedings if they're not in the running for overall points? Everything meshes quite cleverly together and the chance for Rome to trigger a conspirator win is just the right balance.

This sentence threw me a bit in the English Rules:

[i]Note: If, however, you did not add any cards to your display this turn, you still receive a base income of 2 Aurei.[/i]

What? Where? Huh? What base income? Receiving two income had only been mentioned if you passed all three actions and looked at the face down cards in Rome. After consulting the German rules it seems the sentence would have been better served had it been in bold instead of italics and did not contain the word "still".

Otherwise the rules are easy to understand and come with nice examples to clarify everything. Just in case anyone who's read the rules to Pergamemnon is wondering.

PAX -- A whole lotta game packed into a small box.  I think the draw-and-allocate mechanic (Ã  la Biblios) blends very well into the flow of play.

The learning curve is (too?) steep for so light a game, requiring a slog through the rules for each card type before beginning to play, but once a few rounds have passed, play becomes intuitive.

After each play, I keep bumping up my rating.  

Played recently with players who had never played before.  That session affirmed for me that this is a game which must be played in its entirety to apprehend its overall gestalt.  Some games need only be played a few rounds for a player to understand the entire game.  But the endgame in PAX doesn't lend itself toward accurate anticipation.  One really must play a full game to understand how to balance future plays, so one's initial plays can build toward the endgame one seeks.

If you like Biblios, then you'll LOVE PAX!  I'd say that this game is kind of a cross between Biblios and 7 Wonders, but better than either and can be played solo.

SOLO PLAY:  I've really been enjoying the Solitaire Game of PAX. I breezed through Level 1 and had no problem with Level 2. I was starting to think that the game was too easy. However, I've played 2 games at Level 3 and haven't been able to win yet, even with the extra starting card in the display. So, it's not quite as easy as I originally thought and that's a good thing! This game is tricky because a certain number of unknown Influence cards are removed (30 out 74 for the solo game!) at the beginning of each game. As a result, each game plays out differently because it's not possible to know which cards are left in the game or if there are enough icons remaining to beat Rome in a particular category. Tricky, tricky. I like. I look forward to playing this game more and hopefully I will be able to beat Level 5 of the Solitaire Game someday.

RATING: 7.6
A really nice little game. You basically buy and build cards to become stronger than Rome; The players together want a revolution and have to beat Rome in at least 4 of 7 categories. (I.e., there must be 4 categories in which at least *one* of the players is stronger than Rome.) However, you can also become a conspirator; In case Rome wins, the player who conspired most wins. In case Rome loses, the biggest conspirator can still win the game by simply being better than Rome in sufficiently many categories. And you have quite some influence on the categories that Rome becomes strong in.

Cross between Biblios and Firenze.  Played once solitaire, seems okay not much theme.  It's very complicated to explain to new players.

Update Dec 2016:  Played a couple times with my brother, it is like Biblios with much more calculation and strategising against Rome.  Enjoyed it and look forward to playing it again.  Bonus is that this game is super portable, so it's good for travelling.

I made the mistake of approaching this as a engine building game, but it goes by so fast that you barely get anything rolling before the game ends.
It is really a set collecting game with a neutral player (Rome) and a traitor mechanic thrown in.
I can't wait to play again to confirm whether the card drafting is really influential or just superficial.

RATING: 7
Interesting semi-cooperative set-collection game loosely themed around Spartacus and the Third Servile War. It has a similar drafting mechanism to Biblios, but the games are otherwise not comparable. 

Collecting sets of three symbols gives some benefit (endgame VP, card control, bonus income...) but the trick is that all players are also competing against Rome. Each round, a number of cards are set aside for the "Rome" player; if it loses to at least one human in a certain number of categories, the slave uprising is successful and the player with the most points wins. If, however, Rome crushes the uprising, the most treacherous player (one of the categories) is the victor.

It's this semi-cooperative twist that elevates the game into something interesting, because particularly treacherous players do have capacity to deliberately increase Rome's power, providing an alternative, if difficult, path to victory.

I worry that it has the potential to run a bit too long and that luck of the draw can be significant, but this is a great little filler. The artwork is only serviceable.

tl;dr: pretty effective

Wow, this game is 6 years old already! But it's still worth playing if you ask me.
This is a majority game, where you want to have more of different kinds of cards than Rome. And having lots of the same kind also gives you benefits. But you also want different kinds of cards as that also gives you points. Or do you become the Primus Conspiratus and help Rome defeat the players?
This game combines a number of simple mechanisms. Everything fits together very tightly and comes together very nicely.

I really dislike the artwork in this game (it's not as bad as Glory to Rome, but it constantly reminds me of it), but the game itself is actually pretty good.

There is a combination of trusting (or not!) the other players, hand management (a lot like Biblios) and set collection as well as some typical light Euro money engine.

Overall, it works well, but in two plays, I've never seen Rome be any threat at all.

Update: On my third play I won as Rome - mostly to see if I could. :)

Played once so far. I like the gameplay, but it seems like it's too hard to accomplish anything because money is so hard to get. It also seems like it can be hard to beat Rome without specifically working to do so. Will have to play more, but so far I prefer Biblios for a similar card-drafting mechanic.

Update: After another play, I'm not so hot on this game. It's not bad, but it still feels like your options are too limited because of the tight money and the luck of the draw can be a huge factor. For me, Biblios is still the superior game.

I prefer Biblios. This has additional rules and somehow it does not give you the impression that you play against Rome. It is a nice game, but the additional complexity does not make it more exciting than Biblios, plus the scoring rules are somehow generous.

RATING: 7
Pax is a card game where you're trying to be the best person to revolt against Rome... or be a traitor and side with Rome. Players are building their own tableau, but the cards they don't take go to Rome. If Rome gets more of a suit than any single player, then Rome wins that suit. If Rome wins 4 suits then the conspirator wins. Otherwise, the player with the most points wins.

There are seven suits, each which does some special thing. On a turn, you allocate 3 cards by taking one into your hand, placing one on the bottom of the deck, and adding one to a pile in the center of the table. However, you can only see 1 card at a time and must decide which of these three options to perform. But you can only assign one card to each option. So if you take a card into your hand, you can't later do it again with a better card.

After you allocate cards, you can buy one of the piles of cards on the table. The most expensive pile that doesn't get bought at the end of the round becomes Rome's and adds to the totals that you have to beat.

Finally, you can play cards. The first card is free, the second costs 1 coin to play, the third costs 2 coins, etc. You get coins equal to the length of the longest suit you played a card to.

Forest - Each played forest allows you to have a naval unit or land unit

Conspirator - Each played conspirator allows you to have a naval unit or land unit... but you don't get money the turn you play a conspirator card

Navy - You get a point for every navy, and every 3 navies counts as one virtual legion. Must be supported by forest/conspirator.

Legion - You get a point for every legion, and every 3 legions counts as one virtual navy. Must be supported by forest/conspirator.

Wealth - Every 3 Wealth gives you a 1 coin discount when buying.

Temple - Every 3 Temples allows you to see an extra one of your 3 cards when choosing how to allocate your 3 cards.

Senators - Every Senator gives you a bonus coin on the round you play it.

At the end of the game you first check if Rome wins 4 suits. You look at the cards it has accumulated and then reveal 3 hidden cards. If any player individually exceeds Rome's total in a suit, then Rome loses that suit. If Rome wins 4 suits, then the player who has the highest conspirator total wins. Otherwise you score as follows:

2 Points for each suit played
3 Points for each suit where you beat Rome
1 Point for each Navy
1 Point for each Legion
1 Point for most conspirators
4 Points for most leftover money and cards

I like this game. But I found it really hard to wrap my head around. It was challenging to figuring out how which cards were going to Rome affected the likelihood of Rome winning, you beating Rome, and whether you should be conspirator or not. The three hidden cards really throw a wrench into things. You can spend an entire turn doing nothing to look at those cards, but the game is short and quick and losing an entire turn is painful.

Provisional rating, two plays.  Clever card game, could be described as Biblios (Scripts & Scribes) meets Coloretto.  Not sure from my experience whether Rome does in practice ever win, but just having that outcome as something to be sought or fought bumps  up my rating from a 7 to an 8.

One can definitely see the influence Scripts & Scribes had on the game, and it certainly adds some complexity to that basic idea to come up with something new.  That "something new" is the semi-cooperative aspect of it as the players manipulate the cards to prevent Rome from quashing the revolt.  It's a little weird, enough so to make you have to read the rule about it a few times to get your head around it, but that's the real challenge of the game.  There are definitely useful tactics to employ, but they change depending on whether or not you want the revolt to succeed, and sometimes that won't be clear until you see how it looks like the game will develop.  It's a little quirky and unintuitive, and I've gone on record in the past talking about how making a simple game idea more complex usually ruins what I like about it, but PAX isn't so complex as to make it uninteresting.  If nothing else, the designer found a way to take a simple mechanism to drive a straightforward yet tricky little game.

A short filler with some similarities to Biblios.  I'm not yet sure if the odd victory conditions add or detract from the game.  Also, hard to tell if the game changes with 3 vs. 4 players.  It seems like it might be easier for Rome to be stronger with 3 players, but I'm not sure about it.

a decent game with too many rules and boring details to remember. a nice condition victory allows you to play as a sort of manifest traitor: not bad at all! the game flows well, it is too much reminiscent of Biblios in one of the central mechanics but the worst part is "there is too much to remember" for the game it is.
i won't feel the need to play it anymore.

Another Rome based game... oy. In this card game, we fight for freedom during the Spartacus uprising while Rome undermines us in the name of peace. Draft cards under tents, buy card stacks, place cards in sets with effects, get income. Rome takes cards. We compare our stacks to Rome's to determine victor. If Rome wins, the conspirator player wins.

RATING: 6
Quite an unusual card game where the players are vaguely cooperating to beat Rome, but only one of them can win. There is a possibility of turning traitor, helping Rome to win so you can be victorious too but it appears to be very difficult to do. The win conditions are confusingly written in the rulebook, a jumble of [i]each[/i]s and [i]at least[/i]s.

Each turn you see three cards, one by one. You get to keep one card, place one as available to buy and return one to the bottom of the deck. You can then buy a pile of cards, play some to your display from hand and collect income based on what sort of card you played. You're trying to collect sets that will beat Rome's sets at the end of the game. Players have some influence over which cards will go to Rome. Some cards give in-game powers such as cost reductions or allowing sight of more cards; others are worth more points at the end of the game.

I like this game, but with two players not all the deck is used: some cards are removed at random before the game. It feels like this could result in some odd games where large chunks of whole colour sets are not in play. I'd like to try it with four players where all the cards are in play.

:cry: :what: :what: :yuk: :what: A somewhat disappointing 18xx. It felt very scripted and there didn't seem to be much room to accomplish things or make decisions. The prices were fixed, the board was littered with towns, the trains came out ridiculously slowly. 

I mean it was OK, but it was long and kind of dull. Would probably prefer a different title in the series to this one. 

Also I hear it is broken at 4P because of the initial auction.

Ah, the grand old days when Hans im Gluck would put out a six-hour, heavyweight, niche game.  1835 never supplanted 1830 in my group's affections; we preferred the nastier, more freewheeling game.  That said, 1835 introduced some interesting features, notably the amalgamation of the private companies into the Prussische.  

Production quality is what you'd expect of a professionally produced 18xx game.  No, the track tiles aren't of Carcassonne thickness.

This game will not become one of my favourite 18XX's. It's not streamlined enough to compete with other games of the first generation like 1830, 1856 and 1870. Because the companies become in layers the games is a bit rigid.

My lowest rated 18xx game.  The opening bid arrangement (privates, stocks, and minors) really shapes the contours of the rest of the game.  This wouldn't be an issue if the later phases offered some variation, but the way the railroads nationalize limits player options and can be kind of fiddly.

I've now played it twice.  The tile mix is a little strange with the Xs and Ys changing the relative value of routes.  Timing the Prussian is really important.  I'm not crazy about the layered companies with one company needing to float before you can buy a share in the second company and both companies needing to sell out before you can buy the next layer.   While the stock market is 2-dimensional, it is rather shallow so there is less room for stock manipulation.  All-in-all, a good basic 18xx with a couple of twists (the minors and the Prussian).  A good 18xx for a little variety.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Probably my least favorite 'XX. Random seating order seems to be the biggest determinant as to how well one does, due to the all-important initial packet being so heavily constrained. Similarly, corporation start-up is too limited for my tastes.

Maybe I'll try variations, but the rules as written are a pretty terrible example of the series.

The most tactical of the 18xx games I've played.  Pales compared to the rest of the mainstream produced 18xx games - 1825, 2038, 1870, 1856, and 1830.  My friends use a variant where everything in the start packet is purchased outright rather then bid on, and only play with three players. It's fun but for the amount of brainpower required and funky rules (advanced trains, minors and the Prussian, nationalization) I'd rather just play 1825 or 2038 which are similar but better.

This looked like just the right level of similarity to and difference from 1830 - which I rate very highly - to justify a purchase but buying a long game like this just before my son was born was a bit of a rookie error.  The result is I've never played enough to get to grips with it but first impressions were good.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Definitely the weakest of the professionally published 18xx games, by a significant margin. Some interesting ideas are undone by excessive length, the overpowered minors, and a lack of control (through the start packet layout, 20% last shares, oddities in the Prussian ownership, and share availability) for a game so long and involved. A valiant try, but not in the same leage as 1825, 1830, or 1853.

My personal favorite in the 18xx genre.  I particularly like the additional large scale complexity problems of imminent nationalization and the tricky technology upgrade path.

This is a game with many decisions.  The decisions are more subtle than those in most 18xx games.  You are not likely to go bankrupt, or to lose with less than half the winner's score, but that doesn't mean your decisions don't result in victory or defeat.

1835 supplies a rather rigorous corset to the stock market. I'm guessing that is why many 18xx players don't like it as much as other implementations.

It is certainly true that this design decision limits the stock market shenanigans to some extent but it also seems to me like at least some of the complaints can be blamed on groupthink. Even if the stock market isn't quite as dynamic there are other areas that still allow for substantial flexibility, and the looming nationalization of the Prussian railroads adds some additional options to the mix.

I LIKE this game. Of all the 18xx, it's got my vote. I haven't played the others much, so that's not a huge recommendation. Somehow, the area covered by this one has caught my imagination.

This is a more structured game than the 1830/56/70 games I usually play.  We found the takeover rules a bit unbalancing in the one game we played - a president can (under certain conditions) forcibly purchase shares directly from other players&#039; holdings.  This is actually recommended since owning 8 shares in a company increases your certificate limit.

3 or 4 player.

Clemens start packet---

-When buying a certificate from the Start Packet, there are no restrictions on the order in which certificates may be purchased; a player is free to choose any certificate remaining in the Start Packet. Each player in turn may choose any of the remaining certificates (some of which include an additional certificate, i.e., the Saxon director's share with the LD private) for purchase. (These combined certificates may not be separated when purchasing from the Start Packet.)
 
-The very first run of the first stock round is done backwards, all others take place normally. E.g., in a game with four players the first run is 4-3-2-1. Thereafter every run is 1-2-3-4. (Exactly once player 1 has two turns in succession.)
 
-The Pre-Prussian minor companies will not operate until the Bavarian (BY) floats. However, the private companies will pay out if the BY does not float.

Rather than watch JC Lawrence's comments get lost on a Berkeley Boardgamer's geeklist I've decided to copy them over to this spot. They turned our game completely around and are much appreciated still. 1835 as a stock density race!



[q="Clearclaw"]1835's stock market is unusually steep. The blue usually ends up with the highest (or near highest) stock price at the end of the game. Ideally the blue gets a token in Frankfurt and Duseldorf. If if does, it has huge revenues ahead -- very nice if you happen to control 100% of the company as you've privatised other's shares away from them.

The broader pattern is that the player with the most shares wins. In 1835's case, that means the player with the most 20% shares. 20% shares are gold. Get 'em.

Do remember that the tiers become increasingly relaxed as the game proceeds, with lower and lower boundaries for each layer. As a result it is not that unusual for a player to force through the tier-opening condition and to then sell all the shares they just bought in order to grab companies in the newly available tier. 

1835 is unusually subtle among 18xx. The decisions on whether to buy or merely pass during a stock round and wait for others to act (when you have gobs of money) for instance is frequent and significant.[/q]

---

House rules: Poker chips. I prefer to have only enough poker chips out so that the bank is represented throughout the game. When the bank breaks, we add the purple ($500) chips. Once the permanents are in the game, I would consider consolidating all the 'bank branches' into one spot and maybe advertise the drain (roughly) a single OR has upon its funds.

Worst 18XX experience ever. Probably because it was the first time I had ever played an 18XX-type game. Railroads going obsolete? What?!? Here I spent all that time buying up a majority in a railroad company, only to see it disintegrate before my very eyes? This is absurd. It's a '2'.

And that's how I felt about my first 18XX game. Took years to revisit and begin to appreciate the system.


Update (09/18/11): It’s been nearly ten years since I played that horrific first game of 1835. After telling my 18XX friends about that nightmarish experience, one brought his copy and assured me that recent fixes that he had found on BGG would result in a better game.

He was wrong.

There were four of us, and all of us have had moderate experience with a number of 18XX titles, including 1830, 18AL, 1856, and 1870. The game teacher and one other have had substantially more experience. I thought that with ten years of maturation, in terms of wisdom and gaming experience, and my recent up-tick in interest of 18XX titles would carry me through this time.

I was wrong.

After two hours of learning the convoluted rules, we had yet to still play our first operating round. After six boring and frustrating hours, I finally managed to get 35% control of the nationalized Prussian railway, but by this point two of the players had amassed small fortunes. The remaining two players--myself included--were ready to throttle the other two players due to the huge disparity in income and amount of "fun" we were not having. We all agreed to call the game at that point.

Despite the massive overhaul of the starting setup, several of the players were critical of the "scripted" manner in how the various railroads unfolded. Two of us, due to inexperience with this board, made what was a seemingly minor mistake. However, the consequences of those mistakes were magnified, such that we would deeply regret them for the next four hours, as the other two players snatched up both the red and blue companies. Again, despite the restructuring of the game, the owners of the red and blue companies had an enjoyable time, while the two of us that had made mistakes simply watched the game slowly slip away. It became immediately apparent that the yellow, brown, and green companies all interfere with each other in the south-west part of Germany, such that all three companies are relatively worthless compared to the red and blue companies. The Prussian railway was relatively well divided, with 35%, 25%, 20%, and 20%, so the late-game surge we were expecting was effectively diluted.

Since the game emphasizes the scripted opening of companies, it seems that no more than two companies will be available at any given stock round, and of those two, they would probably be evenly divided up. However, players that did well with their minor companies had slightly more cash in order to control the stock buying, and thus control how the newer companies became available. Again, a minor sub-optimal play with the minors seemed to magnify into a large and aggravating disparity later on. For example, despite having good position, my #1 and #4 minors, being surrounded by small towns, were never able to secure the "2+2" trains, due to being "out of phase" with the timing, which would service the small towns better than the "2" and "3" trains. Those two minors stagnated quickly, and then it was a waiting game for "4" trains to be bought, and the player with the #2 minor to begin nationalizing the minors.

I have to admit that the narrative of how these minor companies became a national railway system is fascinating to watch unfold, although it is as much fun as watching paint dry, and nothing but infuriating as the unforgiving game play goes. I will never play this game again. The other experienced 18XX player agreed. I am sure there is a good game in there somewhere that would be enjoyed by hard-core, experienced 18XX players, but I am not willing to invest any more time on this variant--six hours of 1870 play would have been far more welcome. All four of us agreed that this is a poor design in the 18XX series, despite the supposed fixes. One even called it "broken", and validated my emotional assessment nearly ten years ago. It is still a ‘2’ in my book.

1835 was the fifth 18xx I learned.  While the whole group of 18xx games tends to be a 7/10 for me with a few exceptions getting an 8, 1835 only gets a 6 though I still enjoyed it. A big part is the familiar geography. Another interesting feature is the appearance and later fusions of the small companies. Three plays in, I start to understand experienced players complaint about the scripted gameplay. While I rather enjoyed the planks provided by the game in my first game, it got annoying that the other guys almost played on autopilot and I struggled along a distant last.

I have finally played this.  We were all rookies, and we did make a few mistakes with the rules.  But we mainly got it right.  I rather liked it, and would play again.

We spent just under 1 hour on the rules explanation, and were 5 hours playing it.  Not too slow, and in theory we would pick up time on future plays.

This game heavily regulates what company may be bought, so it shows fidelity to 1829.  I can enjoy these games, and they are worth owning and playing.  But the free wheeling of 1830 where any company can be launched at any time gives the players more ability to react with creativity.  So 1835 is a nice game for my collection, but won't be replacing 1830 as my favorite 18xx game.

Has flaws compared with 1830 (look above): The prussian is too strong, eg the owner of the Berlin-Potsdamer has a big advantage right from the beginning. I think, in 80 percent of the games the owner of the B-P will win the game if he (she) plays well. It`s possible but very difficult to crack this, because the stock market in this game is quite static. Any idea to solve this problem?

Not really one of my favorites of the 18XX crowd.  Set in Germany, the structured offering of company shares can make the game boring for those that don't get the 2 major railroads.  I still can't figure out how Wutternberg is supposed to survive.

Flawed on account of its rigid rules for corporation start-ups.

RATING: 6
For an 18XX game this one is too static. It does not allow for such clever stock market scheming as e.g. 1830. Furthermore the fixed order of starting companies lowers the variation and thus the replay value.

Update: After a replay I can also say that some starting positions are clearly better than others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
People really dislike this one but, with the starting variant, I think it is very fun. A bad opening, however, can slow the game down to a crawl. Enough money needs to be coming in to force the Sx and By to actually keep buying trains or risk being overtaken by the second set of train companies. And many of the intermediate companies are garbage, I think.

I just love the minor companies! The 50/50 dividends quickly rebuild your cash pool while also generating cash for tiles/trains. And then there is the formation of the Prussian...

Somehow the combination of restricted availability of new companies plus being allowed to own 100% makes for very interesting fights for shares. The downside(?) might be that there are less dumpings and share manipulations.

Of course, you should play this with some starting variant where everyone has a similar chance to get minors. The easiest perhaps is to simply let each pick be from the whole set of minors/privates/bavarian.

Nice additions to the basic 18xx system.  The plus trains and minor companies are interesting.  We modified the intial stock round to more closely match that used in 2038.  We allow bids on all offered minor and private companies.  This change seems to even out the start so that one player can't run away with the game based solely on getting favorable choices during the initial stock round.

The first 2/3 of a game are very cool and engaging. If the game was to stop after this first 2/3, I'd rate it an 8 or even better. But the last 1/3 was soooo extremely annoying with everybody over-optimizing his deliveries for hypothetical additonal 10$$. That sucks and drags the already long game even longer. This is why I rate it low overall.

1830 - with a structured start - The current start makes for a poor 4 player game. Need to look into some of the variants to change the start packets. 
The major new feature is the inclusion of minor lines, and the absorption of lines into the Prussian national (a theme carried out better in 1856).

18xx.  Takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's [gameid=1823] and adds several new elements.  Players seek to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various rail companies located on a German map.

[b]Comments:[/b]
My group enjoys this title, but only when we use a variant...
[i][Distributes the Start Packet more fairly.]
When buying a certificate from the Start Packet, there are no restrictions on the order in which certificates may be purchased; a player is free to choose any certificate remaining in the Start Packet. Each player in turn may choose any of the remaining certificates (some of which include an additional certificate, i.e., the Saxon director's share with the LD private) for purchase. (These combined certificates may not be separated when purchasing from the Start Packet.) 

The very first run of the first stock round is done backwards, all others take place normally. E.g., in a game with four players the first run is 4-3-2-1. Thereafter every run is 1-2-3-4. (Exactly once player 1 has two turns in succession.) 

The Pre-Prussian minor companies will not operate until the Bavarian (BY) floats. However, the private companies will pay out if the BY does not float.[/i]

This 18xx is more graceful than the others. There is no LOOTING of a public company to buy a private company. The mechanic of stock crashing is less of a factor than the other XX games.

I used to hate this game compared to the others, because of the lack of stock choices to purchase. but now it is one of my favorites.

I have only ever played this once, at my local game group, who are fans of the 18xx series in general. This was my first experience of the series, and it wasn't totally awful, but I'll never choose to play this again. The main problem was the whole last section of the game, in which no-one had any non-obvious decisions but it still went on for 3 hours, then needed at least half an hour to determine the final scores...

I have since discovered that this is the one fatal flaw of all 18xx games, and this, combined with the fact that personally speaking I do not find the gameplay at all interesting, means I would absolutely never choose to play any of them.

One of the weaker 18XX's for three reasons:  
-  The startpacket rules screw the fourth player always.
-  The companies in a specific order means the game is very scripted.
-  Stock market rules and building rules are too tame, making the game dull.

The game that combined some of the worst elements of 1829 with 1830, and then added a badly broken start packet.

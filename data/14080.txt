Very good and historical for its complexity. The big key to the second edition is the East Front, which keeps things interesting as the Germans inevitably get smacked around. Without that, the Allies might get over Rhine and then the denouement would be boring.  With TME2, the Western Allies are racing the Soviets.

Second edition. I did like it a lot. Certainly, there are no fortress cities in the East, the HQ rolls for activation may seem fiddly... but it's a very good description of the end of the war in Europe. My game ended with an Allied victory after the Soviet were unsuccessful in a last turn attack against the Axis forces in Berlin. The new map adds depth: as the Allied player, you must really conquer those cities, and not only exit "y" forces from "x" hexes. The East front is epic, with battles destroying entire armies!

First impressions were favourable, but ultimately I find the SCS system is too broad-brush for my taste and I part-ex'd the game after a few plays. My original rating was 6, but 4 now represents my likelihood of playing it again and my satisfaction with the SCS system.

Felt like an updated AH DDay game of yesteryear's fame.

Simple rules system that brought back memories of those older same-themed Wargames. 

Options are wider in terms of initial landing considerations, but a very exciting race to the German border that seem similar to most game. 

A solid game by itself

RATING: 6
An above average SCS-game. It's nice to have options where to land, but you are strongly encouraged to follow the historical path: assault the three 3-star beaches in Normandy. I especially like the need of capturing ports and the way it effects HQ-activation and bringing in reinforcements. On the minus side is the combat result table. The bias in results is too large for my taste.With Brest firmly in German hands I don't believe a long distance invasion near Bourdeaux is credible.Personally I wished this game has larger hexes (yes, it's very crowded in Normandy) and a faster, more strategic, gamesystem.

Los juegos basados en el SCS son sencillos de aprender y al tener un núcleo de reglas similar permite jugar a varios diferentes aprendiendo sólo unas pocas reglas.

El juego tiene una mecánica bastante sencilla para lidiar con los mandos de los ejércitos y los suministros. Los aliados por supuesto arrollan en Normandía y son capaces de avanzar tierra adentro. El problema está en la velocidad con la que lo hagan. Serán capaces de conseguir mantener sus fuerzas vivas mientras avanzan por Europa, o se quedarán sin gas a medio camino? Se optará por un avance en un eje? O avanzarás todo el frente a la vez?

En el lado alemán las decisiones son más sencillas, pero no menos duras. Ceder terreno en Normandía... ¿Cuando? Tiene que ser lo suficientemente pronto como para no verte embolsado, lo suficientemente tarde como para que el Sena aguante dos o tres meses mientras llegan nuevas divisiones al frente.

La tensión se mantiene hasta el final y aunque el papel del alemán es más pasivo debe prepararse para aprovechar cualquier oportunidad para destruir divisiones aliadas, sobre todo UK, puesto que los refuerzos de estos últimos serán siempre escasos, mientras que los USA pueden reemplazar sus divisiones con mayor facilidad.

Standard SCS gripes, plus this one bogs down at the end in the West, and just ends up too much effort for what it is. The East is too random, with the possibility that the Ruskies will never be able to make an attack (ok, close to impossible - but a string of 
foot dragging can come late in the game, and really randomize the victory odds).

One thing that really bugs me is that the original game expects that Western Allies to make it barely beyond the Rhine, but the expanded game opens up all of Germany - in the same time period (essentially up to VE day); not sure how the Germans could win the original.

RATING: 7
Tough to rate. I enjoyed the first part of the game, up through the end of '44. The Allies have some interesting supply choices, the Germans are in a spot with lots of tense choices about trying to hang out on a defensive line for another turn, or pulling back. The Germans are unlikely to hold out in the bocage as long as they did historically, but they are also likely to be able to run a better fighting withdrawal through France instead of the historical total collapse. The Allies are under some neat supply constraints, which mirror the historical constraints without many rules.

The endgame sucks though. It's a knock-down, drag-out, tweezer-fest war of attrition on the German frontier. The Allies have some options for flanking the line, but if they don't manage it, the final battles are colossally uninteresting but very time-consuming.

Also, there are a couple huge, high-stakes rolls in the game, specifically surrounding ports. The big one is Antwerp. Once the Allies take and clear Antwerp, their supply problems are over, and they can vastly extend the German line to do end-runs around the north or the south (the north is not a realistic option until then). But it's a 1d6 roll to see how many turns it takes to clear the port, and at that point in the game it's a matter of being able to wield the entire Allied arsenal for 5 or 11 turns. Obviously, this is huge.

So, again, I dunno. I liked a lot about the game. But the incredibly tedious endgame, along with the playtime (~10hr for the campaign, which is the only game that makes any sense) is probably a show-stopper for me. I've got 2 other SCS games I haven't played, this, Guadalajara, and Afrika, and I doubt I'd come back to TME. Fallschrimjaeger remains the only SCS I've played that I've really liked.

Interesting perspective on the Allied invasion of Western Europe. I like the port shipping rules. Based on 1 play, it seems the rules encourage the historical situation to develop on D-Day. The Germans have a tough decision to make when withdrawing to keep the Allies at bay long enough to avoid a sweep across the Rhine. Pretty darn good simulation and a heckuva lot of fun, too.

This is the wargame that made me realize it was ok to play a game a few times and then sell it, knowing you already got 99% of the fun out of it that you ever would get.

Very fun till you get to the Westwall, then a boring attritional grind, very frustrating for the Allies.  Realistic?  Perhaps, but not great gaming, then again I feel that way about Bulge games too.  Stick with the Normandy/Marseilles landings and the race across France, then put it away without regret and play something else.

UPDATE: After half a dozen plays, this title isn't seeing any table time.  Play has become scripted and the limitations of the SCS's simplistic systems are evident. 

I have to believe it would have been a better game with the inclusion of Southern Germany as once the breakout occurs, the action is funneled into the Northern German frontier where stacks of units teeter against one-another in a WWI style slugfest for the last 1/3 to 1/2 of the game.

RATING: 7
(2009-11-14) VERY glad I own this.  My first game, though we only got through 6 turns, was VERY fun for both of us.  As the Allied player I made several important mistakes I'm looking to correct the next time I play, which I hope to be very soon.
 
(2010-07-10) At this point I've played the first 10-12 turns several times (about the length of one long afternoon or evening), about half each German and half each Allied.  Overall, I am very happy with this -- rules are decent, map and counters are functional and attractive, and I've found play good.  Yes, the Allies will find that Normandy is probably the best bet, but then there was a reason the historical commanders choose those beaches.  Also, a three beach invasion of Normandy is not a given -- there are a couple of other good options for that third beachhead on turn one.  Yes, the German player is very much on the defensive, but with care he CAN bite, and occasionally bite hard.  For instance, in one game against an experienced Allied player I managed to destroy a secondary beachhead before he could link up with it.

I'm currently playing a game with a friend where we are at turn 13 and will try to play through to the end, and as the Allied player I'm very conscious of the arrival of the German December reinforcements in a few turns.

It does have its quirks.  I've found that an Allied landing at Normandy is basically a non-event in that the Allied player can put 12 divisions on the beaches and 3 airborne in the hedgerows before the German player can even react.  I also find that the air support rolls are to variable and a single good or bad roll determines much of what the Allied player can or can not do for that turn.  However, both are very easy to tweak via a house rule assuming my opponent would be interested in such.

(2010-10-02) After several games I've decided that the invasion 'model' is lacking -- the Allied can break out of any decent first turn invasion site without much trouble, even Normandy.  However, should the German player manage to perform a successful withdraw across France he can hole up behind the Rhine and it is very unlikely the Allied player can cross, so the game is really balanced around how much damage the Allied player can do to the German before then, so altering the way the invasions work may unhinge the game, which otherwise plays quite well.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of the better SCS entries. More balanced than Yom Kippur, more manageable than Stalingrad Pocket II, the west front seems like a good fit for this sytem. 

If you're not an SCS fan, this game probably won't change your mind. The old criticisms of SCS still stand--a lot of down time for the non-phasing player, excessively bloody combat tables that result in "history on steroids"--but these faults have been somewhat mitigated here.  The combat seems to have been toned down a bit in this game, and the results it generates are probably fairly accurate given the scale (10-15 days per turn). You'll still lose a lot of units, though. Also, the low counter density means less down time for non-phasing players. If you are not familiar with SCS and looking for the right game to get started, this one is a serious contender. 

Some of the game specific rules add nice chrome- ports, beach heads, air dominance zones, airborne drops, invasions.  All are handled very simply, with little more than a short paragraph of rules devoted to any one of these new additions. Yet in play, they feel natural and reasonably realistic. Mighty Endeavor may become my favorite SCS entry to date. Only repeated playings will tell.

A game rather than a simulation. Rulebook is a little bit too vague about some wordings but other than that, it is easy to learn. The most fun part of the game is the landing and the allied breakthru attempt. However after the Germans have to start to retreat back the reich the game looses my interest. What this game really badly seems to need is a scenario covering only the summer part of the campaign (10 turns or something like that).

2nd edition. Fairly smooth game, not many units on the map leading to reasonably fast play per turn. Importance of the air domination rule in preventing German units to firefight from one landing area to another. German units hard to get OOS - supply rules for the Germans could be improved. I prefer Stalingrad pocket II better for the moment as I found it more challenging. Putting TME aside for the moment.

One of the first wargames I ever played was Ardennes in the SCS game line. I liked it but set up was long and at the time few wanted to play it. Now I am returning to the series and finding much to like. 

So far I have played only the Eastern Front game. It works well enough, but the Soviet supply rule needs a bit of tweaking. Would have been nice to have the Baltic coast, but this is still a good representation of a tough situation to game.

UPDATE: I finally got to invade France, or at least lead the Nazi defense. The game plays relatively quick and is good. Rules are finicky in places. Free French units should be higher rated; most were veterans of the Cassino battles and had done exceptionally well. Also, the game has made me appreciate Operation Dragoon. Having a few hungry French and American divisions stalking the rear is a sure way to send the Germans scurrying to the Rhine.

I think the game is going to follow the historical script very closely.

I am a sucker for 1944-1945 games and finally a game that incorporates the Eastern- and Western Fronts with a very easy gamesystem!

Starts off fun with the selection of invasion beaches and so on but the SCS system is too lacking in flavour and detail to sustain much interest once the campaign spreads beyond the beach heads - it's not a bad game but it does become a bit of a slog after a while.

Fun game that fills a very interesting and, as far as i know, unique niche - a playable one mapper of the entire western from from '44 to '45. 

The game seems to play out fairly historically and gives a good insight into the how, whys and wheres of the campaign(s), especially from an allied logistics angle, which is quite impressive for such a simple game (It's possible that this is somewhat of an illusion created by artificially assigned beach numbers but I'm not really enough of a historian to know). 

I have some problems with it becoming quite fiddly due to the supply rules and this is magnified by the physical fiddliness of small counters on small hexes with large stacking limits. Combined with a playing time that feels a couple of hours too long for what it is I give it a 7.

Minimal additions to the Standard Combat System are enough to give the Eastern and Western Fronts very different feels.  On the West the elegant use of one set of air points for air superiority, carpet bombing and ground support gives the same effect as much longer air rules in other Normandy games.  I'm not a fan of OCS-style truck-chain logistics, but they do capture the situation on the Western Front after the Normandy breakout quite well.  Overall, the game plays fast and rather historically without limiting your strategy too much in the West.  The East is a slug fest with just one side slugging.  Realistic Russian logistics lead to a historical stream-roller offensive.  No strategic freedom here, but some opportunity for tactical cleverness.

Map and materials are the usual high standard for MMP SCS games.  Despite having three rulebooks, the integration is tight enough that there are no lookup hassles.  You always know where to look based on which map a question arrises on.

My only complaint is those German reinforcements scheduled to come through entry area G after a Russian Front enters via that area.  I'm sure they're not entering in the rear of the Russians, so something must be wrong.  Even the adjacent entry area, H, may be dicy by the time these guys arrive.

If you are looking for an easy wargame starting at Normandy and fighting across France where Germany actually has a chance to stall the Allied offensive, look no further.

RATING: 7.5
Nice components. The rules are well written and laid out and are easily digestible. The complexity is in the moderate-ish level and the system is fast and playable. Since the combat and movement system is comparatively simple, the replayability factor lies largely in the amount of luck. For example, in my first play the Allies were nearly wiped out by the sixth turn due to an unbelieveably bad streak of dice rolls. Long-term planning (especially for the Allies) is key.

After a second solo play, I had to downgrade the rating. The Allies seemed to have too easy a time. I think in FtF play, it would be a lot better.

RATING: 5
This is the only game in the series I've played so far that I didn't care that much for. The Germans just get pummeled continuously from start to finish. The whole game for them is just try and avoid being slaughtered to quickly. For the Allies it's like shooting ducks in a barrel which isn't much fun in the long run.

TME uses the Standard Combat Series (SCS) rules. The system is easy to get into, is flexible, and fun to play. SCS is more game than simulation but, for me, it stikes a good balance between playability and historicity. TME is a good SCS title and portrays the situation well.  However, I think the game is probably more interesting as a solitaire exercise since the Germans have far fewer options during the second part of the game - all they can do is hunker down in their Seigfried Line fortifications and and preserve their forces.  At times, the game becomes a counter cluster  which can be a bit of a pain.  With that said, I do like the game.  I particularly like the simple, yet effective, Allied supply constraints. Capturing ports and placement of truck units (The Red Ball Express) are very important!

My rating for this game could still go up or down. Two face-to-face plays and I'm still not sure. The game seems too long for what it is and both my gaming partner and myself had trouble with the stacks. The complexity level is comfortable though.

I'm no authority on D-Day but I question whether the Allies were capable of launching a second invasion as soon as this game allows (turn 2). Also, all the beaches but Normandy seem underrated. Dean Essig claims that other beaches are viable for invasions but I find it hard to imagine that the Allied player examining them would choose any but Normandy. I do appreciate the simple yet effective way that Allied supply problems are handled

I plan to try it solo and perhaps once more with an opponent before making any firm decisions as to whether the game stays or goes.

Update: In the end, it went.

I like series games and I like the SCS. Nice and simple rules so you can concentrate on the game. Most games are at the same time large enough that it is a challenge to play a good game, a challenge you can take on without looking up too much rules.

Started playig the TME whole campaign (turn 7)  and at the moment it is my preferred SCS module. Very fast pacing, you are both defender and attacker (if you defend west as German , you are going to attack east as Russian; if you are attacking west as allies you are defending east as German). Even defending you have a lot to doand to think, moreaver you have the opportunity to attack. Waiting for ten only at the end of the campaign, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to give the maximum evaluation!

Another D-Day to 1945 war game for the collection.  Plays well.  Balance is pretty much pro-Allies as with history.  However, the Germans can throw a few solid punches maybe even enough for a TKO?  Solid game for the SCS family.

RATING: 8
Initial Impressions: Top quality components. The counters are functional and are easy to remove from the tree. The rules are clear except where is the rule defining which type of terrain in a hex is dominant and how much forest/rough/mtn/etc in the hex, constitutes enough to be considered other than clear for movement and combat?

The map, as with other MMP games isn't quite what I like in a game: glossy and only every fifth hex numbered. Not critical, but it is annoying.

After playing both the east and west fronts (separately) I find a need for some basic chrome. Particularly in the area of weather (e.g. winter) and unit differentiation (e.g., mtn inf units should be able to move faster in rough or mtn terrain). However, some house rules easily remedy these concerns.

There might be a better game on this campaign out there…but the expanded second edition has the Eastern front which makes this a great buy. Apart from being a very serviceable/playable game it is also part of a series which has the same base rules. This is a great advantage as I don't want to have to constantly learn a new rules set for every game/simulation I play. So, all things considered a great game!

I generally like the SCS system. This one gives a good feel the the war in the west. I like how it goes through the breakout phase to the grinding on the westwall. In the early phase it captures how the German lines can be unhinged. The supply rules make it difficult for them to hold a line. However, the allies have to be careful as well they can not afford to many casualties. Particularly like the inclusion of different landing sites and strategies.
Would have liked to have a breakout scenario as well.

RATING: 1
Undoubtedly the most scripted board wargame I have ever played, which qualifies it as a complete failure and exercise in frustration. No matter how well the defender plays the invasion, the Allies will break out by turn 6. From there, it's a game of attrition that the German Player simply cannot win. He must run back to the west wall and hope he doesn't lose too many units during flight. The one carpet bombing will guarantee the Allies will flood into Germany via the area in and around Arnhem. It's curtains at that point. Apparently, the Allies can make back-to-back invasions without pause, which was beyond their logistics capability. It totally amazes me that the publisher is planning a second print run of this game. I would rather play the immensely better balanced and more fun Fortress Europa or even the old D-Day '65. I gave my copy away because I couldn't bring myself to charge anyone $ for this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excellent game especially for solo play.  I like the rule that says you can't examine a stack for fog of war effect.  I just put a low number counter on top of the stack and by the time I come back to that unit, I have forgotten what's underneath.

It is harder than I thought to break through.  Germans just hang out in the cities along the routes and tough it out.  

There are many more things I enjoy too.  But the one thing I don't is some of the rules are not explained.  But that is what the forum's are for.  Very helpful people on the forums.  

The supply lines seems odd especially since there are not enough trucks to extend the supply lines.  With a range of only 5, how are you suppose to bring up your army from the south?  Plus, how do you get across Germany with 3 or 4 fronts?  You can't because you don't have enough trucks, so you have to use less fronts.  Oh well, it is a fun game though.  

Just expect the Germans to get creamed, then run all over the map getting victory points.

I love the ability to "what if" history and this nicely allows for that with the ability to choose different landing sites.  SCS series game which makes it easy to learn and play.  Unfortunately it might be better as a one player game, the German's take quite a beating.  I do like the scale which expands the play area to all of France, different then the typical Normany campaigns that usually end before the Allied breakout.

On the table (11/13/15)

1. I really like SCS because as a new wargamer, it gives me a "basic" rule set that allows me to play different games with ease.
2. I am really, really enjoying it. There is an "epic" feeling to the game as one sees different Allied formations landing, establishing beachheads then pushing out. The German playing has to manage his/her forces well to conduct "campaigns/counterattacks" that will bear fruit later on. 
3. I love the flexibility one is given in choosing invasion beaches and air drops.
4. I love the simple supply system and attack/supply system. 
5. Speaking of supply, as the allies it is imperative that you capture ports and I think it adds clear goals for the Allied and German player. The rules handle this quite neatly, I think.
6. Cool, balance-enhancing chrome such as: Defend the Reich!, German surrender, simple air support/air interdiction system, carpet bombing, etc.

I know some don't like the SCS series because it sacrifices detail and "realism" for added speed of play and overall playability.

Not me!  I think this is a great balancing job and is fantastic for getting new players into the wargaming genre, as well as bring back some old players who left the genre in the 80s.

RATING: 8
An initial rating after some solitaire play. If you are looking for a one map game with easy rules, this is the game for you. The Allied player has all the fun with some interesting decisions regarding landing sites and airborne drops. The Germans attempt to crush initial invasions and conduct a fighting withdrawal hoping counterattacks can catch isolated Allied units. The Germans have a tough time, but some players will enjoy the challenge. This is an excellent game that accomplishes what it is designed to do. The inherent lop-sidedness and my concern over re-playability after several games keeps me from giving it a 9 or even a 10. I need to play more and with another person to rate higher.

An excellent title for the race across France in 1944. The game has superb play qualities and succeeds at suspension of disbelief well but suffers a little from missing reality. 

The choice of beaches is not really very optional, since all ahistoric beaches will fail and the game is decided at the Rhine defense dependent on the losses the Germans & Allies have sustained. 

Nothing will keep the Normandy beach from succeeding but that breakout may or may not succeed in destroying enough Germans to make them collapse. In fact an early breakout may net not enough German losses to win before the Rhine. 

The game is a delight to play though and the whole of play is the intensity during the race for the Rhine.

A beautiful map and impressive components. With the user-friendly rules, I was able to jump in and start playing right away. What draws me most to this game is the Allied commander's ability to choose from several possible invasion beaches.

Yet to play (have watched it played twice). Although no stranger to playing "The Gamers" games (mostly CWBS/RSS), I've not owned any of their games before this one (too many local players with complete collections). 

So far have been impressed with the Standard Combat series rules (why couldn't rules have been as concise as this when I was getting into gaming in the late 70's?). 

My goal is to get my son (whose so far only been exposed to Euros) to play this.

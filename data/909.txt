Wow, this is one beautiful looking game! Absolutely will turn some heads. Play is fairly engaging as well, not bad with 2 but best with 3 or 4. Another thing I noticed is that the game is much bigger than I thought it would be based on the pictures I have seen ( outer ring is 33.5 cm across and large balls are 3 cm across!). Entirely constructed of wood. A couple house rules to consider: a) disrupt the rings and lose your turn b) no making minor adjustments to the rings while the game is ongoing, if one of the rings gets slightly offcenter (and they will) tough! (keeps the game moving).

It does double duty as both a conversation piece & a game in & of itself, plus it's so cool & OOP, you just can't help putting out your hand to touch & move the rings around a bit, just to upset the equilibrium!

RATING: 7
Great family game, in particular when 6-12 year olds are present: small motion control, push your luck, analysis... For adults it's fun too! You can make it more difficult by using a house rule where the soft patches cannot be used to support the next ring.

RATING: 7
When I find myself looking up a game's price, I know that it has triggered some level of interest.  I think with this one, it's just that it looks so cool.   The game itself is moderately interesting, but the way the game just sits there in all its planetary glory puts it in a league of its own.

RATING: 6
A good dexterity game will be A) not too difficult B) simple rules wise and C) will come to an ending. Saturn passes, but just isn't terribly fun, and certainly not worth a collector's premium.

RATING: 6
A neat dexterity game in it's own right, but the real coolness here is just the production of the game!  Saturn is an absolutely gorgeous game, and worthy of setting out on a coffee table just for show (I assume this is why most people own it!).

As a game, it's neat enough, with players trying to place balls onto the rings without the rings touching the table.  The multiple points of articulation make it trickier than you'd think!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An unusual stacking game in that things are stacked horizontaly and their weight impacts the carefully balanced rings.

Unlike many stacking games, nothing ever falls, so no sudden unsatisfactory endings, and the game is almost always moving towards an ending.

The game is a beautiful decoration.

Not really my cup of tea tbh, place balls around concentric rings while trying to keep balance (yawn).  Looks quite good, sure it's an OK game but I think you're probably better off with a similar more attainable game such as Hamster Rolle.

Another neat game (like Tri-balance) that looks like a dexterity game but isn't.  The triple axes makes it a more interesting puzzle to predict what moves are safe, but there's less opportunity for tactical maneuvering (with regards to scoring) than Tri-balance.

A truely excelent looking game. Not to be missed if you have the opertunity to play it. It plays well, and is a nice game, but its not the most exciting in the world. I picked it up from a cash and carry in Glasgow called the House of Sher. I think it cost about Â£12
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A beautiful dexterity game, but a little bit too easy and so dependant on the turn order. Also, I suspect the fixed configuration will make for very repetitive games. Gets an extra point for being so nice to look at!

RATING: 7
A very nicely produced game, that looks great and the game play is fun. Games play quick and are very easy to teach/learn. The rings can be pretty unpredictable, during game play, which just makes the game even better.

This would make a great intro game or a family game with the kids. It will surely draw attention, if left out, as it can make for a very interesting converstaion piece as well.

It is not only fun watching the rings stop 1mm above the table's surface, but there's also some strategy trying to block the other players near the end of the game.

I'm glad I know someone who owns this as this is certainly a unique game.  It's just so different from anything else I've played.  Won't ask to play it all the time but it's fun to throw down every now and again.  As of this posting I only see two copies for sale...one is 165 euros and the other is 500 bucks.  The game is cool but I certainly wouldn't pay that for it!

Players take turns placing various sized wooden balls on the carefully balanced structure that resembles the rings of Saturn. Players must attempt to place their balls on the rings without making the ring touch the table. Higher points are scored if balls are placed on the outer ring. Also heavier balls score higher as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's not really a "dexterity" game per se, but more like a bidding element where players are placing rounded weights (large medium & small) on to the rings of Saturn.  You need to evaluate the right weight shift of objects so that the rings don't tip far enought to touch the table (or your placement becomes void and gives info to the others).  To me, it is more "gimmicky" than a game I'd want to have.  For a really great balancing game, let's break out Bamboleo (with the weight scoring rules)!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
FIRST IMPRESSION:

The game looks cool and the game play is fun, but I wonder both about replay value and start player advantage. Once you learn how the axis and weight works, I would expect the game to become a bit stale. Fun once in a while though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very interesting balancing game.  It seems to me to be more of a tactical placement game than a real dexterity game.  The interaction of various sized balls with the different sized rings is not easily predictable.  Fast, fun and quite unique.

I'll play it if someone (you know who you are) begs enough. Otherwise it's pretty boring. Just place a ball on a ring and see what happens. It's usually pretty easy to tell if it will be a success or not thought the temptation to push your luck is high.

RATING: 7
Attractive game with a great feeling of satisfaction in correctly assessing the situation and placing that heavy ball in just the right spot. Easy to set up as well, which for a short game is a boon.

RATING: 5
A nice diversion but not quite as fun as I'd hoped. Ingenious design, beautifully produced, all wood and dazzling to the eye; over-sized box a bit of a storage problem. Bland with two players, better with three, best with four. Scoring a large satellite on the outer ring is very difficult, as it should be. [16 plays]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very very cool.  Plays fast - put a ball on a ring, dont let a ring touch the table.  Inner ring is 1, middle ring 2 and outer ring 3; each ball is size 1 (small), 2 (medium), or 3 (large).  When one player has placed all or no one can place any more, it is scored by multiplying the ring x size value for each.

I like these games based on physics. This is a nice exemple. But I think this is a "one shot game". You play once, goes "WOW!", but It becames "meh" right in second time.

A real eye-catcher! Less predictable than TRIBALANCE (which is nevertheless the better game) but also less stable. The rings tend to slide by themselves, changing the balance unwillingly. 

Not much longevity- more beautiful wooden sculpture than deep game.

More of an activity than a game.  It kind of plays like reverse Bamboleo, although that game is a little more fun because, unfortunately,  Saturn tends to unbalance itself as you play it.  Still, it would look nice sitting on my coffee table.

On one hand, 10 because it's a classic; very nicely executed. On the other, 4 for getting boring if played more than once or twice a year.

My experience with Theta games tends to be that the gameplay takes a back seat to the artistic quality of the pieces.  This does nothing to alter that perception.  However, it is still an interesting enough dexterity game in its own right that I wish were more widely available.  The three different axes on which the rings rotate make for a particular challenge.  A point of warning -- do not play this at a table where others are enthusiastically playing Looping Louie.

Dexterity game placing different weight spheres on concentric, balanced rings. Looks great but the gameplay is quite simple once you've worked it out. Bought in the Shelter charity shop in Hebden Bridge for £4.

RATING: 5
Wow, this is gorgeous.  How is it as a game? Well, if it works correctly it is fun, but I'm not sure that there is a lot of replayability here.  Put the big balls in the center, the middle sized balls in the middle ring and the small in the outside ring.  Change it up when given the opportunity. Honestly, it the game isn't very good, but it is cool to see the results of how you think it is going to work.  Tribalance is a much better game. 

Mostly it is functional, until the rings slip.  Then you pretty much have to scrap the game, or rewind it.  Really nice try though.

RATING: 6
It's a balancing dexterity game. There's a sphere and 3 concentric rings. Each ring is resting on 2 tabs from the adjacent (inner) sphere/ring. These are on opposite sides, and the axis for each is offset. Players have S M and L balls, and take turns placing them on the rings. If a ring touches the table, you take your ball back and end your turn. Play till someone runs out of balls (or in our case, till no more can be placed). You get pts for each ball = size (1, 2, 3) x ring (1, 2, 3). Most points wins!

It's a cute little game. Eventually you'd get better at predicting which way the rings will tilt, but the 3 different axes will keep it interesting.

6/10

Theta has a knack for publishing hard-to-find and expensive dexterity games that look incredible, but are underwhelming when you actually play them. Fire is a classic example of this trend, and Saturn is another exemplary data point. The components of both games are gorgeous. They look so good that they could double as a piece of sculpture in your living room. But if anyone asked what it was and ended up wanting to try playing it, then you'd inevitably tarnish their image of the piece. There are some truly inspired dexterity games out there (e.g., Crokinole, Weykick, Piratenbillard, Zopp, Bamboleo), which make games like Saturn seem particularly lame by comparison.

What you don't know is that the game takes into account the stability coefficients of Saturn's actual rings - without which Saturn would break free and collide with Jupiter to form a giant two-scoop ice cream cone.

Update:

I've discovered that my NASA source gobbles down pain medication by the handful.  So there's a small chance that the above information may not be accurate.

RATING: 7.9
Very quick, simple, and entertaining.  It's the excitement of watching a dexterity game, with the active gameplay of a simple strategic game.  You place your orbs in discrete locations, and you don't have the Bausack / Arbos / et cetera factor of everything falling apart when you mess up - instead, you just retrieve your sphere, and your turn is done.  The rules are quite simple, but the interdependent fulcra of the rings provide some delicious surprises, as you place your innocent little 1-point sphere on a ring, and watch the balance shift in a way you didn't quite expect.  This game is unanimously beautiful to see in still; however, its greater beauty is the motion on three interdependent axes that influence each other more with each placement.

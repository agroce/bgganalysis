Great game, solid fantasy style romp in the vein of Mage Knight but with less complexity.  

The art is simple and functional.  At first I was put off by it, but as I played, it began to take a backseat to the story that emerged as my avatars moved around the map.  Now, I'm glad the art is simplistic and representative as opposed to descriptive, as that would take away from my personal experience and story.

The game has a lot of dice rolls, and just enough mitigation to make your decisions interesting and meaningful. 

Great for the solo gamer!

This game is delightful.  It can be complex at times which really adds to the richness of the experience.  Read the manual because the back-story is very well crafted.  An awesome evening when you get a group together.  The variable number of boards that you can play with depending on the size of your group is a very cool feature as well.  Try this game!!

Wow!  This game is great! Love cooperative fantasy games and this one really hits the sweet spot for me providing that perfect middle ground between Darkest Night which I want to like more then I do (great character actions but find the action phase and goal in that game not as exciting as I wish) and Mage Knight which I find a bit too complex. Also as a co-op game I like that it avoids the over used Pandemic mechanic while providing a unique challenge and universe.

Find the rulebook informative and well written. Only downside is what is not there notably a table of contents, some rules explanations which are not as explicitly laid out as I would like. However, the designer has been very involved in answering fan questions. Between that and the wonderful supplemental info included on the geek this is not an issue.  This game is crying out for an expansion, can't wait! :D

Very "free" rpg-game. The gameplay part isn't that complex but pretty luck dependant. In my first game we had simply no chance in beating any Guardian.

Really enjoy this Mage Knight-like fantasy adventure game.  It's much more streamlined and direct than its peer and lives on its penchant for producing variable results.  Love the Creature Generator which spits out random monsters for you to fight.  Love the huge card decks giving you plenty to experience.

Great co-op game that works wonderfully solo (which is great for me).  Very smooth gameplay once you get the hang of it.
Love that the designer also did the artwork. That was one point that drew me to the game, as well as the fantastic fantasy theme that works very well.   
Great for making stories, sparking your imagination, especially the creature generator. Also a challenging game, which you can make more or less difficult via starting items and so forth.

Overall, very pleased, right up my alley in every way.

RATING: 10
This game changed my life!  Seriously, it is AWESOME!  SoM finally captures the Questing Adventure RPG lovers crave.  Yes there is a lot of dice chucking, however the game design is so sophisticated that once you understand the system you are immersed in an experience that feels like an entire campaign.  Each player starts out limited by inexperience and chance.  By gaining experience encountering creatures and enemies (yes running away to fight another day) you build your avatars up both with hard earned treasures and learned strategies.  Meanwhile the Main adversary is also building its strength and maneuvering to defeat you. Fate mechanics, an ingenious creature generator, amazing shinies that boost your abilities, powerful potions, multi-level quests added with the Seekers of the light expansion and much more makes this game my absolute favorite.  Oh by the way, the game's creator is the most involved supportive designer you will ever find.  Copies are hard to get, I got lucky and purchased my copy from MM when one popped up for sale.

An adventure game. A somewhat minimalist design that lets you tell the story. Definitely some decisions to be made, and while they're not deep it's still a challenge. There are some unnecessarily fiddly bits though. I'm not a fan of needing to use 3 avatars to have a chance at winning, and combat is unwieldy. So I sold them to a fellow soloist.

RATING: 9.5
A sprawling epic full co-op game that really defies modern board game design, is an absurdly complex game to remember everything that you can do in a turn and I'm glad for the fact that it exists. DO YOU LOVE DICE CHUCKING BECAUSE I SURe as hell do and there's an awful lot of it that is done each turn, whether you want to roll-to-move or roll-to-use-a-potion or roll-to-spawn-a-monster or roll-to-try-and-beat-up-a-monster-but-fail-miserably-and-die or roll-to-respawn-at-a-random-location or roll-to-roll, this game has it all as far as dice resolution is concerned. If you feel like you need to resolve a rules ambiguity between your group, I recommend that you just roll some dice. It'll feel good for your soul.

As far as game progression goes, it evokes a very strong JRPG feel where you need to grind out monster camps to attempt to get some worthwhile equipment, which is drawn randomly from the treasure deck if successful. Those monsters will most likely have some abilities which are randomly drawn from a monster ability deck that will make your day as an Avatar in the Realm of Aethos miserable. Chances are you'll draw a card that you already have the same type of equipment for which you can only carry one of that equipment type, and there's a good chance you'll have to discard it because it was probably inferior to what you already have. What a pain in the ass! After you've accumulated enough decent equipment, you can attempt to take on guardians which are pretty much the bosses in this game, as they are an absolute nightmare to deal with as they'll have more hitpoints, have a higher combat result modifier and will have multiple monster abilities in case you really wanted to wake up respawning at the other side of the world. Depending on how you go, Final Boss Shadow Demon Lord Xulthul may show up and will end your life permanently if you can't kill him.

Fortunately, the best way to travel along in Aethos is to band together with your fellow players, as this ensures a better chance of winning combat against monsters and guardians by throwing MORE DICE against them and hoping for a better chance of a high roll, then you can freely trade between each other when you draw from the treasure deck so even if that scroll you picked up seems like trash, at least someone else can carry it if they have the inventory space to do so. Teamwork is pretty crucial for survival, and the biggest downside is that if someone rolls terribly when you roll-to-move you don't get to move around in the world as quickly as you'd like to, even if you have a base movement of two in addition to what you roll and almost everything has a movement requirement of two or three to pass through apart from roads.

I'm not going to describe everything that you can do in this game, or I'd be ranting on for ages. Go and play it already and embrace what it feels like to spend five hours barely progressing but still having a shitload of fun. I'm pretty sure you'll have a much better chance of winning with three characters than two, like I have been foolishly playing at. It's a real shame that the rulebook doesn't include an index, as it makes referencing rules (and boy is there a lot of text to read) a fair bit of a slog. This game made me an instant fan of Jim Felli.

RATING: 8
Early impressions are mixed but good.  Michael Barnes nailed this game in his review, I'm almost loathe to say more (but I will, heh).  It screams Magic Realm, not so much because it is a similar game mechanically but because it is a similar outsider view on the genre.  It has a 1980s Avalon Hill quality that is both positive and negative.  It features an avalanche of dice rolling and is a messy game with rough edges.  I am not convinced that the combat system works right with high level encounters with lots of bonuses compared to what a great time it is in the early game---I have had several encounters last an agonizing number of rounds because of powers that offset one another.  It can be a lot of work to play unless you've played it several times recently.  I have rated it highly for now but these are the types of games that *can* fall to the wayside due to work involved in play---see something like Triumph of Chaos which started strong but dwindled down in my esteem because of difficulty of play.

The game needs additional reference sheets, which the designer has included with new copies of the game and preorders of the expansion.  Be sure to print all of those out (or get them with your expansion or base box), they will absolutely change the speed of play in the game.  With just a few more FFG style tracking components some of the troublesome short term memory busy work could be handled (e.g. trackers for creature type besides setting tiny dice on cards), I hope the game sells enough to make a second edition that could include them.  And for the love of god, play with at least 2-3 heroes if you're playing solo, preferably 3.

On the positive side, it features extremely creative design decisions, front and center.  Not making the game a latter day D+D clone and creating your own monsters is inspired and fresh.  In fact, it most resembles 1st edition D+D in its do-it-yourself, think outside the box, aesthetic.  Gary Gygax would be proud, I think.

Most of all, the game makes almost every encounter difficult, even at lairs and other turn to turn conflict spots.  That means the fun of the game comes in triumphs turn to turn, not just in a final build up until boss enemies.  I would compare this game to the Dark Souls or Bloodborne series of videogames---even regular monsters require preparation and planning.  They can easily kill you, especially if you aren't banded.  My favorite part of the game is that players must constantly spend consumables---potions, scrolls, shards---shrewdly.  Players cannot win many encounters without relying on consumables, which, along with the limited inventory rules, eliminates the overly conservative hoarding mentality present in most of the genre.

Finally, don't let anyone tell you this game is "luck based."  Decent play of this game is almost laser focused on pre-planning all encounters carefully.  Players roll enough dice to reduce the effect of luck and, furthermore, players can escape any combat immediately if a corner case of a brutally difficult monster comes up or one they are unprepared.  All you lose is time.

There are aspects of this that I really liked, such as the amount of time you spend in exploration rather than just fighting, the art style which encourages the use of your imagination, the interesting selection of equipment, the way you build your character at the start, and the Tolkien-esque nature of the characters.

Mechanically though, this isn't my cup of tea. There is  little to guide the exploration aspect of the game: monsters are unseen until encountered, and the wells you need to visit are also randomly distributed between light and shadow. So, the gameplay ends up being too abstracted and boiling down to visiting random locations (wells, lairs) until the end game is triggered and you feel strong enough. Some other constraints, or the availability of more information, to differentiate the locations would make the exploration aspect of the game more fun.

The combat mechanics are based on dice rolls that can be modified by equipment, and that doesn't hold much interest for me; I prefer systems with a little more going on mechanically. 

Despite the negatives, it's an excellent adventure game with superb production quality and support by the designer. If you're interested in adventure games in the vein of Runebound, Arkham/Eldritch Horror, Gloom of Kilforth, or the like, check this out. Just not for me.

This looks really interesting and up my alley being old D&D player. I watched bits and pieces of video though and think most of the focus is on combat, and it does seem it can go one pretty long with a lot of rolling. The Monster generator looks like the best bit and something I would have done. I really should watch more of a video but with no campaign option or leveling I'm not sure its enough for me to add it to overflowing shelf

12-11-2014 - Taking some effort to get into, but so far it's well worth it!  Once I really get the rules down and the game moves quicker I think this game will go up.  8 for now.  It has most everything I look for in a game, those things being variable length, upgrading characters, varying monsters and terrain, map exploration, and quests of a sort in that you're trying to find and reveal light wells (more random card-based quests slated to come out hopefully next year that'll put this game over the top).  The combat can get a little cumbersome with modifiers, but they're there to keep the game interesting so i don't mind at all.  Great game!

I pimped this game out like no other game I had before. But upon reflection and as it sat on my shelf, I suddenly realized that I was pimping it out as an effort to make it more attractive to me, and I don't mean only in a visual way either. I really wanted to like the game but my 2 plays, played out exactly the same. No tension, no real story, no real tactics, very little reason to not play your avatars almost always together and I won both games solo easily by fighting the Xuthul by using 2 potions I had and then a couple of attacks and it was dead. Game over. I win... In the end, it felt like a prototype that was in its first incarnation, still in need of a lot of playtesting, game development and production value. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Incredible replayability, based upon heavy reliance on dice and cards, is the great strength of this game.  The aesthetic channels boardgames of the 1980s, and is appropriate, if definitely an avenue for improvement in future editions; theme is very reliant on your own imagination, although this is not necessarily a bad thing.  This is a tremendously luck-heavy game, although smart play does help some, as does a somewhat limited death penalty.  As a cooperative title, this is somewhat unique in the marketplace of adventure games.  Ultimately, I simply want more theme and less potentially swinginess out of an adventure game.

I had the great pleasure of working the Shadows of Malice booth at Gencon 2014. I had a great time playing with other people and learning about the different mechanics of SoM. 

For me, the references to D&D-style story telling and the random adventures our party went on made every play-through different. Sometimes our party would split up and the shadows would eat us for breakfast. Other times the party banded together and made quick work of shadows and guardians alike.

Every play-through, anything can happen, from a very angry arboreal to an acid spewing, self-healing mushroom at Playtest hall, That thing took an hour to kill with my party mates. I can't wait to play Shadows of Malice at work. We have board game night coming up.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good campaign D&D style but with the freedom to create your own story. The game itself is your DM. Good hunting and bring the light to Aethos.

RATING: 9
Jim Felli has built a real little gem of a fantasy game here that's going to be unlike anything you've played...so much so that people seem to either love it or hate it. I love it.  This is a game that fires the imagination despite very simple components. Designed by a former role player with a love of adventure games, Felli's provides the story's framework and like any good roleplayer your mind fills in the rest.

Creatures are corruptions of nature twisted by the evil that's rising in a Shawdow World. You generate them in one of six types, Terrovan (Rock, metal Earth monsters), Reptiliad, Protean (oozes and slimes) Arbovan (evil Treebeard?), Avian, Mammal and Ictythic (marine) with a character generator that gives them form. 

Powerful randomly generated abilities give them character -- power that drives their stats, attributes that terrorize. The result isn't some stereotypical orc or cave beast, it's a Lovecraftian horror from another dimension, conjured into your mind by these simple prompts.

Yes the components are simple but it doesn't matter because they're just there to mark your place in the unfolding adventure.

Felli is both artist, desginer and publisher. It's a one man labour of love and while the components are simple,Felli didn't skimp on quality. Everything's designed to last.

The game wasn't Kickstarted. It was self published by a man who didn't want to modify his game to satisfy backers and that says something about this obvious labour of love. Best of all Felli's already working on an expansion that he says will add more realism (back story that affects gameplay) and interaction (quests)to his world.

I can't wait.

RATING: 9.8
One of the things I like most about this game is it is never the same twice...   Since it is cooperative, you can add new players quickly after going through the basic rules and then let them dive into the game.  A new player can band with a more experienced player and easily "learn as they go"  The games we've played are fairly long.  Longer that the 120minutes listed, but that's not a problem as the "open story" concept of the game, where you are making it the story as you go, makes the time fly by.  A group of friends, a few drinks, some snacks, and Shadows makes for a great Sunday...

RATING: 5
Despite my score for this game, it is a great game. It obviously has a lot of love put into it. The story is great, and the monster generator is really fun. A lot of people will love this game, but unfortunately, I'm not one of them. 

I REALLY wanted to love this game. Everything about the story, mechanics and the fantasy aspect of it made me really enjoy the.... idea of it. We played through (just 2 players) a few times, and each time we would throw a fit of rage. Not the good kind of rage, either. We would also feel defeated, not by the enemies, exactly, but by the rules.

Whenever we had a question about the rules (which was REALLY often), we looked through the rule book. While the rule book is very thorough, it can be extremely hard to find exactly what you're looking for, because there are so many rules, and different dice rolls based on what just happened or is about to happen in the game. The rule book doesn't really cross reference itself, which would be extremely helpful. Just for example, if I wanted to know about how many "x" I got when "y" was defeated, it might either be under one of four sections - "x", "y" "defeating an enemy" or "defeating a 'y' enemy."  It was always a guessing game. 

In the end, we just couldn't have fun because we couldn't become immersed in the game. Every move was riddled with questions, or anger at constantly dying, or having some lasting negative effect on a character that was already at a huge disadvantage. When we actually did do well in the game, the pride we felt was great, but usually it was short lived, as we realized we only won because we didn't follow the rules.

In closing, I think this game deserves a better score than I gave it, but only if you can invest the time to learn the rules through and through, and if you are content with playing with the same group of people, It's not a game you can really teach someone in one night, and to learn it yourself takes a lot of patience. Even with the helpful community giving cheat sheets and printouts, it's a difficult game to remember the rules for, but if done, could be very worthwhile.

The Painted Goblin's review in April 2016 is pretty accurate, I think. Take a look for a more optimistic view of the game.

In my opinion, its too random and repetitive. Enter lair, hope for a beatable monster, if not, withdraw, if so, defeat it, get loot. Rinse, repeat. I like games where you build up your character, but the withdrawing option just really hurt my enjoyment of the game. I house ruled it and made it more interesting to where you have to go one round of combat with any monster you encounter unless you have a true evade card. That made it a bit more interesting, but the options within the game were still too few for me to really get into it. 

Its off my table for the time being. We'll see if I bring it back out to give it another go.

A great adventure generator. It's mostly dice-based, but there are some interesting risk management decisions to make as is common for the genre: blow a card or save it, retreat or press the fight, etc. Only real issue is difficulty playing with one avatar but I'm working on that...

This game is a very difficult, highly complex, strangely abstract cooperative adventure game. On a positive note, I like the simple art-deco visual style!

The art was not enough to keep this game in my collection.

Love the variety the game provides.  Not a game for everyone - you've got to enjoy randomness and potentially getting squashed when the dice turn against you.  That works for me, as I enjoy the need to constantly update  your strategy to work with the resources you've got.

game has a lot of really awesome ideas but is poorly executed.  Needs a lot more development time that didn't happen.  This is your typical Kickstarter game that has lots of inelegant choices that would have washed out given professional development.

Too bad because the bones are there and the publisher is a really great guy.

Very enjoyable cooperative game.  I'm normally not much for cooperative games but this one is very fun to play.  It is never the same twice.  Easy to develop your own story and great for developing your own way to defeat the shadow.  You can play solo too if your friends couldn't get a kitchen pass for the night.  

Took me a little bit to not forget a few of the rules as I stepped through it but the videos on BBG helped with that no problem. 

High quality product with durable pieces. You definitely get your monies worth in this box!  A must buy.

This game probably shouldn't work -- but it does. The minimalism encourages imaginative play. It's a perfect example of how smartly chosen limitations are crucial to both storytelling and gameplay. It practically demands the use of the BGG contributors' player mats and custom dice. As many have said, it's not for everyone. Accept it on its own terms and you might find it to offer a unique and memorable game experience.

For me, the game felt way too random. Basically everything came down to a series of dice rolls that took too long to figure out combats. There were very few ways to effect these dice rolls. Time wise, they just took too long and pulled me out of any theme that was there and made me aware that I was simply rolling dice. For this style of game, even Shadows of Brimstone is better at creating a cohesive theme and I hated that game. Eldritch Horror just does this so much better.

May 2015:  Played once with John S, Bryan, and Allen.  Not ready to rate it yet, but I will say that it was more dice rolling that I would have wanted.  None of us had played so that's probably why my character managed to die on the very first turn.  Ouch!

If first impressions mean anything, then Shadows of Malice might be a masterpiece. It's basically unique in its approach to everything. This is the freshest take on adventure games since Mage Knight, and it will probably end up being played more because it is much simpler. I've never seen anything that approaches co-op mechanics or narrative in quite the same way, and its spartan production is an intentional step to give the players freedom to visualize. This is one of the best fantasy board games I've played in a long time.

I very much enjoy playing this game. Took a little bit to learn all the aspects of the game, but once learned it is worth while! I play it both by myself and with friends. The cheat sheet cards are definitely a good thing to have when playing the game. They make game play smoother for newer players.

A lot of attention has been paid to creating a combat puzzle, dice-based, but with lots of ways to modify die rolls to force a statistically more favorable outcome.  So, the interest is in solving the puzzle of combat each round, similar to Mage Knight.   The weakness is that combat is all the game offers.   Other than perfunctory "terrain" types which primarily modify the time it takes to get from one combat to the next, there isn't much to hold one's interest in the game's world, which presumably your character, or "Avatar", is pledged to rescue. (To be fair, this is a weakness in Mage Knight, as well).  This could be improved, however.  If the designer chooses, the direction he might amplify the game is toward fleshing out the world, itself, to make it more intriguing to explore and move about.  Yes, even quests.   Anything to make the geography of the map tiles more meaningful.  This is a matter of taste, as it adds complexity.  Right now the game is elegant as a single-purpose combat scenario and sometimes that is the itch that needs scratching.

Not a game for the X-box generation. There, I said it.

Let me give you two situations:-
No.1:- I enter a lair and roll for the creature type and see it is a Mammal. I roll for its power, it's level 1. Finally I roll for abilities and score high so need to draw 2 ability cards - these are Agility and Regeneration.
Now each time I attack, there's a 50% chance my Combat Rating will be reduced by 1, and a 50% chance any damage I cause will be reduced by 1. Also, there's a 50% chance any damage will heal at the end of each combat round. I pick up the dice and go into combat...

No.2:- I pick my way into the lair and laugh as I see a pitifully small white rabbit. I recoil in horror when I realise it is munching at a corpse and its mouth is bloody with gore. Raising my sword and uttering a battle cry I charge the creature and I am almost decapitated as it dodges my attack with blinding speed and bites my shoulder near the neck. Gasping with shock, I swing my sword futilely, unable to connect with the agile beast. Eventually I land a lucky blow and can only stare in dismay while the wound inflicted on the rabbit closes up and heals almost instantly. As the rabbit takes another chunk out of my flesh, I realise this is a foe beyond, and look around for a means to escape...

The people who go with situation 2 will get a lot out of this game, the situation 1 players maybe not so much.
This actually describes a creature I rolled up randomly in my first ever game and I was put instantly in mind of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog.
 
So there it is - inside the unassuming black box is a toolbox for your own imagination, and I think it is fair to say that you will get out of Shadows of Malice exactly what you are willing to put into it.

No other board game I have ever played has provided me with this amount of freedom and space to create stories. It provides a framework for your imagination, choosing a simplistic and often non-existent graphical representation of the core game elements. Your characters are eye-shaped tokens, your equipment is a series of cards with very basic representations, the world is a map of simple although very beautiful tiles with hills, mountains, deserts and swamps. Your character roles are defined by "masteries", eschewing the traditional fantasy tropes. 

Then there are the eponymous Shadows, which lurk and grow within the shadow realm. You can see them physically increase in size as you place life tokens underneath them, forming tall columns of menacing power. You know they are coming, and the feeling of fear is real.

All in all a fantastic game, which rewards those who are willing to invest themselves and their creative imagination fully into the world of Aethos.

A great game that reminds me of Magic Realm except this one has lighter rules (still complex). The randomness from the dice can put people off but the trick of this game is to find the balance between risk and reward - and knowing when to mitigate rolls with soulshards.

Fabulous game! It feels gratifyingly freeform despite the need to play strategically; travelling around the game world, exploring, fighting, visiting mystics, forming and breaking away from groups of fellow adventurers...  

I just love the illustrations/graphic design, it really enhances the gameplay as there are no jarring depictions of heroes/monsters; this way they appear exactly as you want them to i.e. female characters with clothes on, how novel is that!

A somewhat 'meh' draggy cooperative game with an exploration theme. It seemed to take ages to travel anywhere and there weren't many mechanics involved, except combat. A bit dull...

RATING: 4
Very disappointed by this. The glowing reviews that rightly pointed out the iconoclastic and/or retro design choices failed to point out just how lackluster it is in terms of decision points. It basically does one thing: generate random opponents to fight. The fight system itself is rather dull (high roll gets a hit, apply modifiers/stuff before and after). There's no clever hook, it's just a grind-it-out fight generator. Despite all the cards, the vast majority are just variations on a simple theme. There is very little mechanical variance in abilities, and there's not enough hooks anywhere other than combat to hang interesting twists and abilities on.

My bad for not doing enough research. I get very little adventure, and even less game, out of this. I'm shocked that anyone even mentions Mage Knight or Magic Realm, or even a much lesser game like Runebound, in the same breath as this.

This game ist really tough (we play only with 2 or 3 players) and a because of its grafical style some kind of an imagination experience: Is a huge reptilic beast with a kind of natural armour and a fire breathe really a dragon... or perhaps something else?

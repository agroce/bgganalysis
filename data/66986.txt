Good physical production values.  Fundamental lack of clarity in things as basic as LoS rules, and no apparent plan to fix them.

We have a nice group of guys playing this in my area. If it continues to see regular action, the rating could go up.

Update: Game tended to be somewhat repetitive and our group play has died off.

Intense tactical sci-fi squad combat.  The system could really use a set of well-balanced scenarios for competitive play.

Played through a couple of demos at a local con. Some nice bits, but it didn't come together for me. The card-movement restricts movement in strange ways, for no good reason that I can figure out. Attacks took turns to set up, and could be foiled by people randomly running across fields of fire. You can increase your actions by 50% by waiting for someone else on your team to go, but the order units move in is randomly determined each turn.

It might make some sort of sense, eventually. But after two games, I still felt completely lost. I've played other skirmish games, and I don't think I've ever run into so many situations where I had to ask, "Wait, why can't I do that again?".

A great game with plenty of promise. The rules are fast, furious, fun, and most importantly rely on the players grasp of tactics and team-work rather than cheese or lucky die rolls. The models are top notch, if a little expensive. Don't expect mass-releases of models or products, the game is developed by two guys in their spare time, but they've shown to be serious and put out an extremely professional product. The new rulebook is beautiful!

Version 2 Kickstarter backer, haven't received it yet.

RATING: 7
A solid set of science fiction skirmish rules. True skirmish scale with each force consisting of 5 minis chosen from a total of 6 minis (soon to be 7) for each faction. Pretty simple game but the hi tech hardware is presented with specific rules and each faction is distinctive. Using the character cards for fire and move templates is gimmicky, but it's a good gimmick.

My first miniatures game.  An absolute joy to paint and play.

RATING: 5
I like the small size (2'x3', five models) and fast play (45-60 min) of MERCS, but I wish it had stronger scenario support and fewer rough edges (in a typical 6 turn game, a sniper may be able to fire no more than 2 shots, leaving him all but worthless).  There are a lot of new ideas contained in this package but, like many a game from a first time designer, not everything is fully explained.  The movement, in particular, is very awkward as written and was heavily changed after release.

RATING: 8.5
Mercs is a great miniature game since you just buy one pack to play the game. I would strongly suggest playing scenarios and making up some of your own scenarios. This game really shines when you play it that way.

Factions owned: USCR, Sefadu, ISS, House 4, Texico, House 9 (FCC).

Really wanted to like this game -- bought into it heavily and promoted the hell out of it. The more we played, the more the rules were "meh" to WTF. The card movement was nothing but gimmicky, and really just got in the way of game play. The company then decided to focus on other games before fixing this one; local area then lost interest, even with 2.0 (finally, supposedly) being released this summer. I have moved on to Infinity and Gruntz.

Great skirmish alternative in the scifi genre with beautiful minis and innovative gameplay. I can see room for growth and plenty of opportunity to expand to a larger-than-skirmish game after the initial buildup.

After almost three years unplayed, I'm taking this off my Want to Play list. If it hits the table, it hits the table. If not, I had fun painting the minis; I'm okay leaving it at that.

This game has potential but it is not quite there yet.  The rules do not address various gameplay questions we have.  Also the rules need a little more development in my opinion.  It is incredibly difficult to hit a model when you are shooting at them.  Unless you are an assassin model, there is little reason to go into hand to hand combat since someone can leave melee with no penalty.  In that situation, as the aggressor, you have to hope to win the initiative which is a random d10.

Like the unique game mechanics with the stat cards. Only tried basic demo game(3 on 3 models). Larger model count, scenario based play, and more 3D terrain would add much needed depth. Like the individual model initiative mechanic. Will be keeping an eye on this to see how it develops. Update 1/11-puchased 5 man KemVar unit. Tried some of the basic scenarios. Some fun but still feel the game needs "something" more. 8/'11-Added Sefadu to collection

Great models. Easy enough rules for a table top miniatures game. Great entry point into full table top gaming.

RATING: N/A
Small number of miniatures per side (5 in play, out of 6 possibilities), making it pretty accessible to new players and not a major investment for the game (leaving more money for cool terrain!).  I have the core rulebook, a Sedafu unit (painted), and a KemVar unit (not yet painted).

One of my favorite miniature games. Simple rules. Easy to get into as very few miniatures are required and very little extra equipment is needed. No Tape measure, very suited to be played on 2D terrain.
Some very good miniatures, though not as beautiful as Infinity. But the system I overall enjoy a lot more than Infinity.

Nicely scaled miniature/Boardgame hybrid. Rewards interdependent team strategies over 'killer models'. Like all Miniature games though, it is most rewarding with painted models and terrain, so caveat emptor if you aren't a hobbyist.

Overall, my favourite Sci fi minis skirmish of the last two years.

Nice set of rules. True skirmish with 5 minis per side. Very dynamic and innovative.
Might surprise a veteran miniature gamer though due to some unusual ruling regarding overwatch, suppression, fire into melee or disengagement.
The rule boook and some cards may need a v2 because a lots of rulings and FAQ were produced after the publication.
The designer team should stay aware that with a game of positionning they should be carefull while producing fast and/or evasive factions not to unbalance the game (main issue being maybe, actually, Kemvar - but I need to practice more to have a final advice about balance. Their optical camo gives them an enormous edge with a 2 points malus in a game where hitting opponents is not easy -  a malus of 1 point would have been better - also their heavy is the strongest in the game due to an errated card).
The other minor drawback is the need for a symetric battle board scenery to ensure balance (due to the above mentionned issue with speed - furtivity in a positionning game).
Overall though a fun and money wise game.

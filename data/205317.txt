RATING: 9
DEMO REVIEW - Played at Gencon 2016 and really enjoyed it. Gameplay went fast after rules were a bit learned (as usual) and there is the spirit of the game implemented where you can stagger enemies and then glory kill them simply by moving onto their tokens. Has a slightly last night on earth feel with a player running the demons (not sure if that will be part of the finished product).

I have a biased opinion as I'm a fanboy of the theme. If this played as well with any player count less than 4 marines vs 1 invader. I'd put this at a 9 or 10. Lots of cool stuff going on, but if you play it with less than max player count have a player control multiple marines or this game breaks hard. Fingers crossed for an expansion as I still love this game despite its flaws.

Didn't want to pay OOP prices for the first version so I passed.  It looked as if I didn't pull the trigger on this one, that history would repeat itself.  I picked it up, now I have to check it out.  I'm going to do my favorite part now which is download the rule books and learn a new game.

Initial Impressions: Fantasy Flight Games doesn't scrimp on the component quality for this game, as the minis are gorgeously detailed and very evocative of the theme. I enjoyed choosing the charater's special ability and like how each player's deck is personalized by the equipment they pick up. The monsters seem to share mechanisms borrowed from the Overlord in Descent. My fear is that despite my limited experience with the game, I've seen most of what the game has to offer. This is a very basic run-and-gun and more shouldn't be expected of the game. I expect that FFG will release more content and perhaps a campaign mode in the near future that may open up the game.

I've only played this once, but I'm very keen to play again. The miniatures are great, and the card play is good. The hands do feel tight, and movement in particular can feel quite restrictive - but its not a problem as such, you just wish you could do more at times.

My first entry in the 1 vs. Many genre of boardgaming. My play group felt it was very easy to get into (learn to play guide) and the game maintains a good pace as the wordings and rulings are fairly straightforward. We looked at Decent 2.0 and IA as they look like great games in this genre, but as an entry level gamer of this style felt they may be a bit overwhelming to get into. Ultimately we made a good decision as everyone throughly enjoyed the game and can't wait to table it again!

Initial Impressions:
So I definitely need to play this again, but the first mission is pretty boring as the Invader.  The balancing is awful (the designer actually apologized for it lol) which for a longer game really wore on me.  The mechanisms are interesting enough that I do want to give it another shot (I do find the "Cover" aspect a really cool addition to this "Descent" system), but as of right now, based on mission 1.... This wasn't very good.

RATING: 8
I don't know what to think about this game after 3 plays... It seems to have huge balance problem between Marines and Invader.. If You play as an Invader You feel helpless. We'll see when I play other scenarios. They say that's the problem with first scenario only... Hope so. After tutorial and 1st mission it is a bummer.

Update after few games:
Game is really good, first scenario is just not balanced at all. That's it. I still think it is easier to play as a marine. Balance in this game is growing with number of players and with more marines it becomes easier and less frustrating for invader. It is good to give this game a second chance and play something different than first scenario.

Theme bonus: I've played this game on PS4 and I love it. Board game is very similar to what You can find on the screen. I would love to see spider mastermind in the box. In the real game this monster is the real boss not Cyberdemon.

The most excellent aspect of this new iteration of Doom is the player deckbuilding via weapons. Each marine has their own custom deck of cards made up of sets based on the weaponry they have. You start with a couple of weapons and can pickup things like Chainsaws and Rocket Launchers. This hand/deck management adds a really interesting layer to the game that is fun to engage with.

There's also a cool Glory Kill mechanic where a wounded enemy can be auto-killed if you move onto their space. This helps achieve a cinematic level that mimics the twitch playstyle of the video game.

The Demon player mostly resembles classic Doom in that you have a hand of event cards. Spawns are removed from the Demon deck and metered out much more slowly via portals on the map. The twist to the Demon player is managing argent, a resource you gain in different ways that lets you trigger special abilities on each creature. As a whole though, the Demon player isn't particularly exciting or innovative when compared to other recent releases like Conan or TMNT: Shadows of the Past.

Overall, the gameplay is fast paced when it comes to delivering the action (although very long in length). The weapon abilities and style reminds me of Adrenaline a bit, with an additional heaping of drama.

I think as a whole, this is a very solid, fun game. I do think it struggles to make a case for besting its peers though in terms of the overlord system. The player deck mechanism is absolutely phenomenal and it makes a name for itself there.

Those figures though, best FFG has done yet.

Played with 2 players. Would not recommend for 2 players or small parties. FFG obviously didn't playtest the game for 2 players as 2 player mode is incredibly unbalanced and just a dull experience. Game is also a bit too random in order to make any tactical decisions. If you're buying this hoping for a good 2-3 player game you're better off buying the older Doom 3 Board Game. 2-3 player games in the older edition were much more tense and balanced, where as in this version its just a cake walk for the marines.

This game is worth owning for any miniatures combat fan and obviously any Doom fan. Takes some of the gameplay elements that Imperial Assault and Descent (which come from the original Doom board game from 2003) and turns it up to 11. Combat is fast and furious and for the first time in a one vs many game, you never ever have to pull any punches as the Demons (overlord style role). 
I would say this is one of the most fun miniatures combat games especially when played 1 vs 1.

The game is beautiful, exciting, tight, streamlined, extraordinarily well-balanced (our games are always neck-and-neck), provide a huge sandbox with different game modes, customizable decks and maps, and uses a theme that I love.

My only issue is that the very first mission in the campaign book is broken, but there's no requirement to play it.

For me, a 10 star game is one that I predict will have longevity, and for me I don't see an end in sight for this game. I don't know when I'll feel that I've exhausted what it can provide me. This is a complete game. It needs no expansions (although a few small tiles and more cool miniatures are always welcome).

RATING: 8
Probably more fun to play as marines, balance issues not apparent on first few plays. Svelte design, though this game is not short. It's play time is two hours minimum, which is a shame as though shorter than other games of this ilk, it isn't as short as would suit it. Overal it's a tidy package, the minor deck building element for the marines is interesting and reducing the decision space though maintaining the interest. Glory kill mechanism is fun. Models are great.

Addendum: I've noticed balance issues at the lower player count in favour of the marines. Having played the video game makes the design decisions make increasing sense, they were going for speed, which is a feature of the game, which it achieves to an extent. Its faster turn to turn than other games of this type, but generally I find the genre a la ffg to be plodding. However this is about as trim as its comes and I am appreciating the design more and think the whole package, which doesn't feel like it needs an expansion, is really good. I'd like a Wolfenstein game next please.

RATING: 8
I have not played the original Doom based on Doom3 and for the longest time, I thought I would never get a chance to do so.  While I understand Doom 2016 and the original are quite different animals, I speak only from the perspective of someone who has played just this one, so no nostalgia glasses here.

That being said, this Doom pretty much took everything I disliked about Imperial Assault and threw it out the window.  What you get is a distilled, fast, and furious skirmish game that wears its goal on its sleeve - action, and lots of it, please.  I am happy to say that Doom delivers in spades.

Surprisingly, the ruleset is pretty streamlined.  With just the Learn to Play book, you're up and running in the first hour after you've opened and punched everything; it's really that quick.  It doesn't lack for any meaningful decisions, either, although from the Marine-perspective, it's pretty straightforward - run and gun and have some fun.  The Invader, on the other hand, will need to manage resources and have the more tactical decisions to make with regards to powering up his demons and deciding what to spawn and when to spawn them (as the scenario permits).

That being said, it's a bit fiddly, but all FFG games enjoy some level of fiddliness.  In Doom, it's the constant shuffling and reorganizing of cards.  As I said, I never played the original, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect; to my surprise, everything was described as cards.  Weapons are cards.  Powers are cards.  Defending is cards.  Initiative is cards.  You get the idea.  As the landscape of the scenario changes, so, too, do the cards that are being shuffled, manipulated, tapped, exhausted, and what have you.  Normally it's the transfer of tokens and other bits that bog down the typical FFG game, but here it's the opposite.

However, none of that detracts from the game, especially if you're used to other FFG tactical affairs (how many decks does Mansions of Madness have?) and despite the shuffling and tapping, everything just pops and plays quickly.  The minis move as you expect, the combat flows quite easily and doesn't concern itself with exceptions.  The tiles are lovingly-detailed sci-fi facilities or the fiery pits of not-Hell, and the minis that populate them are thankfully based off Doom 2016 instead of Doom 3 (and they are gorgeous).

Does it have a campaign mode?  No.  But Doom ain't an RPG and this game doesn't pretend to be one, either.  Gear up, go in, frag each other to bits.  Excellent fun!

A little.....dissappointed?... maybe..... that this version of doom is much easier, indeed both missions we played resulted in very few frags and the overlord player didn't feel like he was in contention for the win at any point. Hopefully this is just the first few scenarios whereby they are adding more and more elements as you become familiar with the game. 

It feels a lot more polished than both original doom and the gears of war boardgame which has a lot of similar mechanics. I really like the initiative deck which is shuffled as you cannot then plan turns as effectively and it is much more reactive to the current board dynamic, and the card actions are quick and easy to understand. Defense is a very clever card flip mechanic. 

Currently maps feel a little small as the majority of weapons have 4-7 range which is pretty much the length of the maps at the moment, but again I think this will change the more we play. Looking forward to playing again actually

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
For me this is a near perfect game; heavily biased by how much I love and played the early 90's DOOM and DOOM 2.
It's quick, gory action. It plays like a multiplayer deathmatch, complete with respawns. Grab the big gun, run up to the demon, pull the trigger, die, respawn, repeat. 

play listening to loud music.
This could only get better if the figures and art were based of the original DOOM. Then FFG Would release dozens of expansions.. and I would be penniless. 
I'm considering picking up a second box to paint and create epic levels.

Ah, DOOM. I was hoping for a little bit more than what it gave. This feels very much in the world of games like Descent and Imperial Assault. Now, I _love_ Imperial Assault, but DOOM feels like such a distillation of its properties that I'm not sure I have room for this. I don't think there's anything particularly "wrong" about DOOM (other than some Mission imbalances, which I didn't take the time to check personally). There is a lot of variety in terms of cards, weapons, demons, etc., but at the end of the day everything is just offering slightly different quantities and ways to throw dice for attacks.  Again, that's all well and good, but for a game that can take 2-3 hours, I want a little more than tit-for-tat dice chucking. This isn't to say I don't like such games, but DOOM left me wanting more... or less.  Either I want the complexity, theme, and engagement of Imperial Assault or I want a quick-playing, smaller investment sort of game like Memoir 44.  And that's only two that I've mentioned.  I've got a nice, rounded collection of tactical skirmish games and the ones I keep are the ones that do something different from each other.  There are some real neat ideas in DOOM to keep everything streamlined (especially how cards are used and handled) but it's not unique or scintillating enough to create a great deal of interest. By the end of both games that we played, neither of us felt like there was something different to try out or explore next time. But that's not what this game is anyway: it is a straight-ahead, fight-to-the-death game, and it faithfully does a lot of the video game does, and that is wholly to its credit. But as board games go, it didn't bring anything that new to the mix.  In the end, I'd play it again, but its quite a time investment for such a simple game.  Sort of left us feeling... bored.

I was sucked in by "Drive Thru" review by eekamouse. Now I have only played the game once but it seems very unbalanced. We played "leaving the nest" and it started out great. I like the spending threat tokens to activate portals and I like the defense system. 

All was going well until the marines reached the chain gun which can really tear the invaders up. Still I was managing until another marine reached the chainsaw and then just had to walk into undamaged invaders, even my strongest, the hell knight, just walk into him and kill him. But using cards to give the marine more movement actions just devastated me.

 I did manage 4 frags until the chainsaw, once that came out I couldn't even keep invaders on the board. They actually had two turns with no invaders and when I finally spawned new, they lasted all of two seconds. Seems to me that a stagger value should be at least half of an invaders hit points. To have a hell knight have 13 health but stagger at 10 seems not right. Hoping they go the way of first Doom and fix it with an expansion.

After playing through a campaign of Doom...

It's just not as fun as Imperial Assault. I.A. is far more rules intensive and slow, especially as everything is open information. I also really like the slight deck building aspect of the game.

But Doom ultimately just doesn't excite me all that much to play. One note, I played as the overlord (as it's a 1vmany) my group seems to rate it higher.

the game itself is well designed and plays well, but despite all the reviews that claim this is something special, it really isn't. it is a repetitive dice fest that can be very imbalanced at times. the invader system is 99% the same as in descent; activate your invaders, one group at a time and buff them with cards from your hand. the marines play a little more interesting, though still similar to how marines are played in gears of war. all in all I am very disappointed by this game. it does not offer anything interesting to keep me engaged.

This is so, so great!  

I'm a big fan of Descent & Imperial Assault, but this could give them a run for their money.  It's so straightforward and full of tons of action.

I love that the campaign is pretty much non-existent.  While campaign play can be sort of appealing, it requires too much pre-planning to have the logistics work out.  With Doom, I can just pull it off the shelf without having to double check that everybody is going to be available to play for the next however many weeks it will take to complete the campaign.  It's going to get a ton of play due to this.

The card play is fantastic and so clever.  Each hero has their own deck of cards made up of 2 sets of weapons (plus more as they pick them up on the map) and a set of basic equipment cards (provides things like defense/shields).  Weapon cards of the same type tend to combo well with themselves.  Let's the marines pull off some crazy maneuvers/shots.

The demons have great special abilities, but most of them can't be triggered unless you have argent.  It provides lots of resource management - such as which cards to discard to gain argent and when to use the argent on the demons.  

Invader definitely has a learning curve (and I think the first mission in the operations book might be slanted towards marines).  There are a lot of things to consider when using the demons and how best to utilize them.  However, after a couple of plays, I was able to even things up between me and the marines.  I've had several games end where either side could have won it that turn, if things had gone slightly differently.  

Love the initiative system!  Adds a lot of tension.

The game has some balancing problems with fewer player numbers, this is very obvious if you take a look at the forums section. I like it nevertheless. I generally enjoy one vs many games so I still rate it a solid seven nevertheless.

Got this game for Christmas 2016. First play was on 04 Jan 2017. Two marine players Alpha and Charlie against me as the Invader player. Tutorial mission. The Learn To Play Rulebook is written very well. Firstly, the components all clearly listed and identified. And then the game's basic mechanics are explained in detail through the use of a tutorial mission. The tutorial mission gives the Invader player and the Marine players everything they need to grasp the core rules and master the gameplay, before moving on to the more advanced rules. The handy Rules Reference booklet is there for any clarifications.
My friends enjoyed the game and are eagerly awaiting the next session. I found it a lot more enjoyable than the previous version of the game. The miniatures are of exceptional quality. Overall, I have to say that this looks like it is an excellent game from Fantasy Flight Games.

Me gusta mucho, pero la curva de aprendizaje es larga, es un tanto complicado de enseñar a nuevos jugadores. Componentes muy bonitos, miniaturas de gran calidad. No es muy dependiente de la suerte, la estrategia juega un gran papel. Muy dependiente del idioma. Excelente para jugar con un grupo de amigos o familia. Importante tomar en cuenta la sugerencia del juego de poner al jugador con mas experiencia como el intruder.

Fantasy flight once again prove they no how to squeeze the best out of an IP which isn't always easy, especially with a franchise like Doom. The game plays fast, the card combat system is fun to play with and both sides are rewarding to use. On top of that the miniatures are great, the whole package is really impressive.

A really fluidly moving and action-packed game. We thoroughly enjoyed playing this as it is our kind of game: one v all, lots of great figures, nice board art and a low degree of complexity.

There are demons featured in the art which are absent from the game, and there are too few dice for the number of players (even two) and so here's hoping expansions bring out more demons, more dice and something to enhance the starter weapons, an upgrades deck for example.

The upgrade deck for the deck-shuffling mechanic leads into the next point. A campaign element to this would really help enhance this game. As an add-on, a campaign would help give the game a great flow and more opportunities for customisability. The story in the missions is present, yes, but it is subtle and has no impact on the game overall. The freedom to pick and choose missions is great, but having that option for a campaign would be a great addition.

Overall, the game plays easy, is simple enough to teach in minutes, but retains everything that is great about the DOOM franchise, transforming and translating a successful first person shooter (FPS) computer game into a brilliantly fun board game that retains all of those FPS elements, the adrenaline, edge-of-your-seat combat and victory against the odds, to produce a great game experience. The DOOM 2016 soundtrack i available on YouTube and music streaming services, and I would recommend playing the game to that, as it only adds further to the thrill of this very streamlined and blood-pumping game.

This is an incredible game for what it is. It is a serious action video game, turning into a board game. If you are looking for Descent with Doom, you may be disappointed as there is no campaign system like Descent, however the Hero Players (Marines) having their own Card Deck, that changes based on the weapons you have, is an amazing addition to this genre, and would love to see some of these mechanics added to future Descent editions.

Really having fun playing this one. 
The minis are ok, I wouldn't say spectacular but good. Just need to figure on painting them to make them better.

In some cases there are more tokens than needed but, then again, that's good in case you lose some or something.

The price for this game is actually very good for what you get. No complaints there.
I would be willing to pay a couple extra bucks though to have the box have compartments for the tokens, cards and mins. Although it does seem that whenever I get a game I never agree with how they have the compartments. So, I guess maybe just more bags or something to separate things.

For actual game play, it is very enjoyable to play through the missions provided and when we are done, we review how it was played to get ideas on what we would do for custom games and their set up. 

The more we play the more we learn about how/what we could, would or should do as either the Marines or Invaders. The game does make you think in order to reach the objectives so get your strategy hat on and map out the hallways.
It can seem slightly slanted to the Marines but, as the Invader, if you think about your movement and breaking that up, Argent Powers, hit and run stuff, then you can do some seriously fun fragging.
The thing I learned about playing in a one vs. one game is to get the Argent Powers for the invaders and use the heck out of it. There are a few cards for the invaders that cause collateral damage but since there is only one Marine it doesn't make sense to have those cards in hand. So, discard them and get Power tokens. Then, take it to the Marines with your extras. Too much fun seeing the look on the Marine player's face when you pick up that token to play it.

As a Marine, those Glory Kills are your friend and a ton of fun. When you get a Baron of Hell down to his stagger and then run in and Glory Kill him it is so therapeutic and who doesn't mind splitting open an Imp or two or three? 

When you finally get to fire off the BFG your smile will take some time to dissipate.

It takes a little bit of time to set up a scenario (maybe 10 minutes) but in doing so both the Marine players and Invader players get good ideas on how/what to play. 

We like that there is strategy combined with resource planning and dungeon crawl mechanics.
The play is fast-paced with lots of action and suspense as you wait to see what the dice say or what your opponent does to thwart your attack.
The carnage will be a plenty with this game so prepare to frag or be fragged.

This one has and will continue to get a lot of game play over here. 
I would put this on the recommended buy list.
If you like the video game franchise then this will sooth your soul. You just don't have the same visuals but heck, make some sound effects and you'll be good.

Doom, for me, is a nice no strings attached quick combat game in the stylings of Descent and Imperial Assault.  While the game does not come with a campaign mode, I can live without it here since the game is just in your face action and leaves little room for long term planning.  If you are looking for a solid one vs. all combat game with really nice minis, this is your place.

Grab your shotgun and rev up your chainsaw, it’s time to kill some demons. Hell is unleashed and as a UAC marine, it’s your duty to drive the forces of Hell back. Or, as the invader, it’s your job to destroy those who stand in your way and pave the way for the Icon of Sin.

This game is fantastic!


I want to say Thank you to everyone here (and who posts afterward) as well and on another thread where I asked about this game. Your input helped push me over the edge to get this game and I'm EXTREMELY happy with it. This game has a slick, flavorful way of having meaningful choices while not slowing down for analysis paralysis through the clever use of card mechanisms and the smart elegant use of dice. This is really the DOOM game I WANTED when I got the first Doom board game years ago (good as it was for the time). I'm extremely happy with this and it's a game I don't think I'll stop being excited to play (despite having only a little knowledge of the video games)

I'm really happy how it manages to give tons of theme and flavor without slowing down a heck of a lot to do it!

Great new version and quite different from the previous. Call me masochistic but I still like the old Doom: the Boardgame better. What has been improved in new version are the new action system for players that has light deck building feel - if you pick up a new weapon, you will add cards to your deck according to that weapon. And all the actions are based on the cards you get from the deck - a well designed system and gives more interesting choices to players. Also the game balance has improved quite well and new components top the old ones. What is missing? Well, the storytelling foremost - no flavour text about each room and so far no riddles or mystery (at least in first two scenarions). The other thing is related - the whole map is visible from the start now. I like to go into unknown and discover it piece by piece with the constant feel of horror of what lies ahead.

Completely different to the original version (which we didn't really get on with, despite it ultimately evolving into Descent 2nd Edition which we love).

This new edition has a fully-revealed map at the start (versus revealing rooms as you go, one of the things which gave the original a "GM" feel and only allowed for that "exploration" feel on the first play of each scenario). It does still require an "Invader" player, not being fully co-op like eg. Gears of War board game.

This is really streamlined compared to similar FFG games, and the customisable decks & mix-&-match scenarios should keep it interesting for some time.

Gave this game multiple chances.  It was terrible for the Overlord player every single time.  I tried the intro mission twice, mission 1, and mission 4 or 5 (since everyone said the intro ones weren't balanced).  I love the system and the minis are AWESOME, I just wish it was fun for EVERYone.  Couldn't get rid of this game fast enough.

A great enhancement over the original 2004 version.  The figures alone are worth the cost of this game.  They are phenomenal with their sculpt detail.  Great game for dice chucking.  Marines got the much needed boost in power to make the game easier for them.  Invader player has definite challenge in fighting back.  The ability to choose your starting weapons adds a ton to the replay value.  This is a lot of fun that really feels like it pulled the original game off the screen and placed it on the board.

Absolutely horrible game. It is completely luck based - what damage you deal, damage you receive, and order of initiative. There are hardly any decisions made in this game and there is almost 0 reason to pay attention to other player's turns other than to consult. This is the first game I will flat out refuse to play. 

It genuinely amazes me that such a horrible game has an average 7.9 rating as of this writing. I suspect it's because of the die hard Doom fans that overlook the horrible gameplay. I like the miniatures and it's probably fun to play as the demons, but this game is awful to play as a marine.

I like the gameplay a lot and I think this is a brilliant design, being fast paced and streamlined, implementing the video game very well.

However, once again, this game suffers from balance problems because FFG, once again, did not implement proper playtesting. Additionally, some last minute scenario design decisions that were not tested screwed with the balance even more.

It is always the same for FFG's (tactical skirmish) games: a good game turned mediocre by improper playtesting. FFG must improve on this.

My rating might improve if FFG delivers some errata that improves game balance.

I love everything about this game and when i played it multiple times it broke my heart. The game play is one sided and marine players are never in any danger. I have read the rules multiple times to see if we were playing wrong and have seen everything we do is legal. Models are a 10, maps are a 10, and other accessories are a 10 but the game play is downright unfair and is a 1.

Doom 2016 its a skirmish tactical game, I like it for what it is but i think it has lost the epic feeling that the old Doom had with the campaign system. The new mechanisms that it has are nice, marines need bigger decks since you have to shuffle their decks all the time and that can become fiddle after a few games.Minis are top notch, Well done FF, I like the new rule books, easy to read and progressive stages of how to play.

If you expect quick and brutal encounters with some dice rolling and luck involved you'll enjoy Doom. Similar to it's PC counterpart it's fast and easy to die. Demons are falling one by one and if not carefull and cooperative so do the marines. Production quality is great, miniatures are looking awesome on the table and rules are easy to grasp.

I wish they included some pairs of numbered tokens for traking health of demons - it's a little whacky to place damage tokens near them when you move their figures all the time. But that's a just a minor complain on otherwise fun action game.

Hard-hitting. Immediate. Excellent hand management. Actual tactical considerations. Scenarios that don't care whether I'm playing a dorky campaign. Killing demons with a chainsaw. This is FFG's corridor-crawling formula at its level best.

The 2nd edition, and a completely different game to the 1st as I understand it. Still a 1 vs all game, but with pre-constructed maps.

The minis are excellent too. Also, it's DOOM.

Tactical miniatures space marines scenarios on grid movement modular tiles. This version reminds me of my 2004 copy which I love but it is showing its age.  Namely, the overlord gets to have more fun with the spawn points and card driven action system. Marines get a bunch of cool classes. I like the token system to spend for enhanced effects.  I like that the move action can be split up with combat and special actions. And, the big one, you don't run out of ammo every time you try to shoot a freaky space monster. The glory actions are the star that tempt you into danger and risk for the reward and makes the game come alive.

Light rules make it easy for non-gamers to play, but potential exists for fairly deep strategy which must be tailored to situation at hand and player group.

This is not a deep game, but it is fun. The components and artwork are top-notch and provide atmosphere, which is helpful in the absence of any real integration of theme. This is basic stuff - a long drawn out auction process, to buys goods, to make sets, to gain victory points.

1st play: Excellent production quality and a neat take on auction games. Drags a little with 5 in the last few rounds, but not too bad as long as everyone is paying attention to the game. I liked it, and look forward to my next play.

No 2nd play: Just never got around to it, willing to though.

Excellent game with great graphics and wonderful bits. There may be a play balance problem with the first player at a distinct disadvantage. Perhaps the earlier one is in the turn order, the more money with which one should start.

RATING: 5
An auction game with an element of time pressure. You make a bid and then it is assessed a turn later.  If someone else has bid more, you can increase your bid, but you'll be waiting at least another turn to get the goods.  There are only ten turns.  Perhaps too often for the sake of an exciting game, the best option is to withdraw and bid elsewhere.

Otherwise, Cargo Noir is a familiar story of collecting sets of goods to be traded in for some light development (warehouses, ships, syndicates) or victory points. It all works OK, but just isn't very involving.

The black market theme with goods to match makes a pleasant change from grain, cloth, wood and ore. Artwork and production are to standards you'd expect from Days of Wonder.

After watching the Days of Wonder promos my thoughts were: There is no way that this game can deliver on the theme presented and be as good as the trailer makes out.

I was right.

However, the game is a fun bidding game with wonderfully produced pieces. Very simple fun family game.

Good light bidding, set collection game with simple rules and good player interaction. I like that the bidding isn't a back-and-forth one-upping of each other and that it gets straight to the point of what a player thinks a dock is worth. There can be some clever maneuvers with picking up cargo and immediately swapping them out to create sets.

I apparently rated but did not comment this one.  It's been a while since I played, but: enjoyed the bidding wrinkle and production, decidedly did not enjoy the downtime between turns.

Collect cargo tiles in one longround of bidding.  Tiles need to be acquired of same type - bigger scores, or in a run.  Fairly light.  With 5 players two miss out on fifth ship - a big disadvantage.  Three or four players and there is no shortage.  Don't think the shortage enhances the 5 player game as the two operating at reduced capacity are effectively out of the game.

RATING: 7
Have noticed a tendency I have in auction games (and auctions in general) to assign a value to an objective (in this case goods tiles, in other cases, baseball players, etc.) and stick to it, regardless of other considerations. That means I don't do well in auction situations, as I always feel negatively about having to "over-pay" for a set of goods.

Given that Cargo Noir is essentially a bare-bones auction game, then, probably not quite a game I'm always eager to pull out.

Great production values. Lovely artwork and a neat game too. The theme is not as tight to the game as it might have been - at heart this is a trading and set collectiong game that could have been themed in any number of ways, but the artwork really helps it stand out from the crowd.

Solid game.

While I was never excited about anything, this certainly 'did stuff'.

EDIT:  What I didn't like about it, was that when I was hosing an opposing player, I was never really sure how much I was hosing them by--so I couldn't really take any joy in the hosing until long after the fact.  The other thing I like and don't, is that I think I would need to play several times to really get a feel for what was happening.  Like, the first play through, you don't value why you should just slap three coins down on something you know you're going to get overbid on.  Getting delayed on picking-up your stuff 2-3 turns hurts worse than you know.

This is a game that I want to like a lot. The mechanism of delayed worker placement functions effectively, and adds some interesting things to think about. The players put out their ships on one turn, but don't find out if they will reap the rewards until their next turn. The look of the game is great, and most of the components are excellent (aside from the cheap fabric of the bag.) Sadly I do have some significant issues with this game, and they are not only keeping me from giving it a really positive rating, but also moved it straight from my unplayed list to my for-trade list. First of all the game starts to feel very repetitive in a short amount of time. You take your ships, you occasionally cash in your goods for point cards, then you put your ships back out. Again and again for 10 turns. It can feel downright boring which is never a good adjective to use for a game. I also fear that there is a massive start player advantage (or at the very least a big last player disadvantage.) Since some of the point cards are in limited supply being earlier in the play order can really swing who gets the cards first. Lastly, the game is just too needlessly aggressive. Others will disagree with this, but in our family we tend to avoid games where you can hose another player so dramatically. It just feels so cruel when you are setting them back an entire turn waiting for a ship to bring back any benefit. In the end, while I did like some of the mechanisms, and I'd play again, I'm definitely trading Cargo Noir away. It's just not for us.

Had heard some negative remarks about this and was initially not that interested in playing it. Had free time during a game day so tried it out.
It was a fun experience. The rules are pretty light and I like the idea of the players being shadowy smugglers. Guessing it may not have great potential for many replays though because while the cargo that come into play on the board is dynamic the victory cards and cargo are static.

RATING: 5
A somewhat unique system of worker placement as a bidding mechanic, but it ultimately fell a little flat to me.

Basically, in Cargo Noir, you place ships with coins on various auction blocks in order to win the tiles there.  The catch is that, if outbid, your ship essentially gets stuck there for another turn where you decide to overbid or drop out, thus wasting an action, so you must make every bid count!

However, this twist wasn't enough to make it all that exciting to me.  Other than the twist, it's very basic bidding for tiles that you turn into sets to score points.  Not enough to be that exciting to me, but perhaps a good family intro to bidding games.

The auctions are a bit frustrating in that being overbid costs you a turn, and there's really no way of knowing if someone is going to overbid you at their own expense.

I like the bidding mechanic in this game - this creates a lot of fun interactions. I also like that in the beginning there is less money and fewer ships in the game and that allows some nicer less confrontational play and lets everyone get going. Then in the mid-game, when everyone has most of their ships and there is a lot of money, things start to freeze up and you have to make some interesting tactical decisions. 

There is a bit too much downtime, and it lasts just a little too long, but it is fun and different.

I got this for free when buying 2 x Ticket to Ride games a couple of years ago but didn’t manage to get it to the table until now. The game hasn’t gotten a whole lot of positive reviews, probably because people expected yet a big hit from DoW. Anyway, I’ve played lots of good games which BGG thinks are crappy and vice versa, so even though I wasn’t expecting much it could probably only be better than what I expected. 

However, the game was quite tedious. The gameplay is very simple (probably too simple) and there aren’t a whole lot of interesting decisions in this game. The “auction” is very limited. I could also see the game involving a fair amount of kingmaking because some people would block off others because of the good tiles. Anyway, the game was really not that interesting even though it looked gorgeous (like all of DOW’s games). We did only play it with 3 and I suspect the game would be slightly better with 4 or 5, but I doubt I will ever find out...

Oh, and I have to mention the box insert! It is terrible! Once everything is punched, there isn't enough room for all of the components, so the box lid does not close completely. This is not something I expect from a company like DoW. It's a minor quibble, but it is nevertheless annoying when the game sits on the shelf.

Unloaded this game eventually because it simply didn't hit the table often, and whenever it did it was honestly rather boring. Beautiful pieces, but the theme just didn't come through and unless playing with more players it simply wasn't very fun.

RATING: 7
A light game with a mechanics that have a euro feel.  Easily picked up by casual gamers.  It's a good one to have in your collection for those times when you have family or friends over who may not be up for the advanced euro-games.

The art is cartoon-ish and well done.  While the board is of good quality, the character cards feel somewhat flimsy.  The ships are plastic (or rubber, not sure) and are of decent quality and design for a game as light-hearted as this.  My biggest beef is with the gold coins which feel shoddy and could have been made better.  The bag that comes with the game tore within 5 minutes of the first play.  The bag in the version I played at Origins had also been ripped in the same area.  My guess is there is a defect in the manufacturing of it.  
(NOTE: Days of Wonder has acknowledged the defect and is offering improved replacement bags via their website for free.)

Games take @ 30-45 minutes over the course of @12 turns depending on the number of players.  Only takes @5 minutes to teach a new player the ropes.

Amazingly, an auction game I'm quite partial to. While it's pretty simple overall, valuation is really important in this game. Being outbid will cost you a whole turn before you can respond, so you'll want to bid the right price for the goods you're after (or perhaps avoid some of the most lucrative ones altogether, if you think your  opponents will over-value them).

RATING: 7.25
On the plus side, this is very easy to learn, has great bits, and provides a very interesting twist on auctions - it's much more like a silent auction.  Players send out ships with a "bid" and hope it holds until their turn comes back around again.  But if another player sets down a higher bid, when it comes back to you, the options are to up it again or abandon.

Players are bidding to get smuggled goods and complete sets in order to cash them in for luxuries (i.e. VPs).  You can also invest in extra ships, more warehouse space, or a syndicate (which gives you cash for abandoning a bid).  Other options are to get guaranteed cash at the casino in Macao, or exchange goods on the black market.

The negative of this game is the downtime - it is so substantial that when it's not your turn, you can't help but whip out your smartphone to play a little Ticket to Ride.  Perhaps this is less of an issue with 2 or 3 players.  Also the lag time makes it feel harder to be in control of your fate - you often send your ships to port with a silent prayer, just hoping your bid will hold up.

So I like the game and will definitely be playing it again, but it has problems that will keep it from being a favorite.

Components: Wonderful artwork, worthy of the Days of Wonder imprint. Quality, oversized, stackable coins. Fun rubber ships.

Experience: Interesting bidding/set collection game. Has a bit of Korsar in it (needing to be the highest at the beginning of my turn). Not too many tough choices (it's always worth it to go for the big sets), but deciding where to bid, and whether to hope for an outbid, is fun.

Game traded. This is a set collection game where the sets are directly traded for VP. Although I like the theme and the production quality was good, I found the game to be bland. This might be a good gateway game to show the set-collection mechanic to newbies, but I suspect most seasoned gamers will find it bland. My game group found it disappointingly lacking.

Lead your organised crime syndicate to victory through auctions, because even criminals like to play it fair.

Poor mismatch between theme and mechanics make this game an odd one to play.  There's no sense of smuggling or getting away with anything; the gameplay is light and the only conflict is generated when somebody bids more than you.  (And in response you can... bid more than them!  Ooh!)  This could easily be a game for kids with a re-theming.

The chunky rubber boats and plastic coins are fantastic.  Mixed feelings about the art.

This game might have been welcome had it come out a decade earlier, but its pleasures seem pretty mundane by today's standards. There's no arc, no build-up; you do the same three things over and over. Staying out of bidding wars appears to be the key to winning, but you have only so much control over whether an opponent decides to bid against you.

Players represent a black market faction, travelling the world making a profit from illicit goods and purchasing luxury items with the gains.  Very simple game where players take turns resolving their ship locations (gain money, exchange/gain a good tile, purchase goods at a port).  Goods can then be traded for items, which grant victory points, plus possibly bonus items/ships.  Lastly, ships are placed out on the board in preparation for the next player's turn.  Lots of thoughts - some good, some bad.  I thinks this is better than the initial reports indicate, but it's still a fairly average game.  It's probably the best new game from Days of Wonder since the superb Colosseum.  The presentation is gorgeous, and for once the modern garish art style does not get in the way of game play.  At it's heart though, this is a fairly average placement/set collecting game, and feels like a game Knizia would have designed 10 years ago, and packaged in a small box - just this is dressed up in Days of Wonder Game-i-Colour.  Not horrible, not great.

This is a good game about shipping and markets, but it misses on the whole "smuggling" theme.

Just takes some getting used to.

A pretty one-dimentional game for the big box. I actually think I welcome that, though. It seems that a lot of big box games have that "everything but the kitchen sink" motif these days. It is also surprising to see an auction game be released by a large publisher. DOW continues to deliever on high quality components. 

As far as the game, I liked the integration of turn order and multiple auctions. I only foud the actual game to be just so so though. The end game seemd a little frustrating. 

After a revisit, you can prevent endgame frustration by preparing ahead of time. The game itself is better than I remember it, but it is still too long to be a game I suggest, however I would be happy to play if someone else wanted to.

[1 play]  I think maybe this one falls into that category of game where if you play quickly without thinking too much, you're constantly screwing up and annoying yourself, but if you take your time and try to work out what's best to do, the game drags annoyingly. It just doesn't have as much interest as the amount of time and effort you have to put into it to play well, if that makes any sense.

I found Cargo Noir to be too light for my tastes. The set collection is good, though it is difficult to score a full set through patience. The bidding for tiles is of less interest to me, coupled with a method of bid point generation that I just didn't enjoy. Converting sets into the various trappings of illegal wealth is fun and adds some character to the game.

Overall, I don't mind playing but I do not suggest the game myself.

Because I had read mixed reviews, decided not to get this game. Played the store copy tonight and it is now on my "get" list. Everyone in the game described it as "solid" and liked it.

Straight forward play--nothing dramatically new, but does have a nice auction mechanic I have not played before. Moves along very smoothly with easy rules. Very attractive graphics (better than it appears in photos), and great components--especially the ships. The board adjusts nicely to different number of players, although I doubt I would enjoy a 2-player game nearly as well--I tend not to like bidding wars between 2 people--that 3rd+ person always makes a difference.

The theme could change and it would be the same game--I don't have a problem with that as some do here on BGG. This could be played with cubes placed on various shapes with no theme at all, but the theme & artwork is colorful and entertaining and adds enjoyment to the game.

A note about the insert: The Cargo Tokens once punched from the frames will fit in the bag beneath the insert that nicely houses the rest of the game. However, the insert is somewhat flimsy--not sure how it will stand to being repeatedly lifted. Since the box was designed for this storage, wish Days of Wonder had made the insert more durable.

A nice hour of play. All looking forward to playing again.

Cargo Noir is a simple set collection and bidding game. On your turn you place bids on a number of lots, then you wait for everyone else to take their turn, and when it gets back to you you grab all the lots for which you still have the highest bid.

Apart from the significant downtime, the game works well enough as a lighter auction game for the most part, but there is one aspect that pretty much kills it for me. A frequent dilemma here is whether to play in your own best interest and risk someone else running away with a cheap shipment, or to sacrifice yourself for the benefit of everyone else to prevent exactly that runaway leader. That's one of the most boring decisions in the history of gaming: play to the best of your ability and compete for second at best, or give up and let everyone else have a good time. Yeah, sure.

Well, maybe a night club would be better...  Drips with theme and meaningful decisions.

Cargo Noir is a pleasant game, one nicely suited for families.  It is easy to learn and play, with simple mechanisms.  There are decisions to be made throughout the game, but none of them are terribly taxing or too complicated for even moderately young children.  There are opportunities to hinder the efforts of your opponents, primarily by sending ships to ports they covet, but there is little overt nastiness.   It is a light, pleasant affair, which may disappoint folks expecting a more challenging and cutthroat experience.

While the game works just fine, it lacks excitement.  The theme is enticing, evoking images of persistent danger, cutthroat tactics, and uneasy alliances.  Sadly, none of these are present.  The harshest assault is simply outbidding an opponent.  Further, the game has a repetitive feel.  Each turn is very similar to the previous.  Even though turns are fairly quick, weariness sets in after five or six turns.  There is a desire for the game to end, and that is never a good thing.  

Cargo Noir is a basic and familiar set-collecting game wrapped in an intriguing theme that the game fails to do justice.  What is here has been done before.  That is disappointing.  While the game will undoubtedly receive widespread play do to the admirable reputation of both Days of Wonder and Serge Laget, it probably won't make much of a splash in gaming circles.  Perhaps this isn't the market for which Days of Wonder is aiming.  That's perfectly fine, but I am still a bit disappointed, as I eagerly await each company release and generally enjoy most of their games.  This one falls a bit short.

Sokat kerülgettem ezt a játékot, és most sikerült végre leülnöm vele játszani. Nagyon úgy érzem, hogy jól döntöttem, hogy nem vettem meg. Nagyon szép grafika, nagyon minőségű komponensek (Day of Wonders ugyebár), de nekem kicsit túl száraz volt. Az eleje még jópofa volt, de aztán ahogy mindenkinek egyre több akciója lett, egyre lassúltak a körök és a végén eszeveszett pontszámolgatásba ment át. A játék közepén volt két szerencsés húzásom, amivel sikerült olyan előnyt szereznem, amit nem sikerült behoznia a többi játékosnak, de nem azt éreztem, hogy stratégiával nyertem, hanem hogy szerencsével, ami 2 óra játék (számolgatás) után nem annyira kielégítő. A második órában egyébként már konkrétan unatkoztam, amikor nem épp én voltam soron, ami egyértelmű jele, hogy ez nem az én játékom.

Sidenote: Öten játszottunk és többen igyekeztek nagyon-nagyon megfontolt döntést hozni (AP warning). Lehet egyszer egy lazább társasággal kipróbálnám három fővel is.

Played with 2 and 5 players, more fun with more people, but still a good game for 2. The rule book is more confusing than it could be (to paraphrase: "Start on phase 3 the first turn" What?).

After the first turn the game feels quite natural, and there's a careful balance between buying small upgrades for your family, or buying big lavish items that score the most points. Buy the big items too early and you may find yourself behind for the rest of the game.

Game pieces, boards, money and chits are all great quality, but the included chit bag is frayed on the inside (meaning you'll pull out a fiber as well as a chit).

[c]disks --> chits --> cards[/c]

Bid disks to buy sets of chits and trade them in for victory point cards. 

Mildly intriguing auction & set collection that requires intensive screwage to prevent runaway scoring. The moment someone doesn't use their turn to check their right-hand neighbor that player gains advantage and everyone else starts to lose. So you either play like massive dicks or let someone run away with it.

The underlying math is nifty—casual sets will almost always add up to one fewer than you need to purchase the next VP card.

It's mercifully short, though I'm not sure how it's supposed to be a family game unless such things usually involve tears.

UPDATE:  Okay, so one more play, this time without the vicious cycle of openhand slapping, e.g., everyone constantly raising their right-hand neighbor to prevent runaway progress, the lack of which changes it from a brawl to a race.  This is probably closer to what the designer intended, as the vindictive bid-fights just made the game bitter.

Never-ending bid fights:  low-scoring fight game with lots of retracted bids, making Syndicate cards very worthwhile.

No anal neighbor-checking:  high-scoring race game with less profanity.

There's probably a happy medium, but I have my doubts we'll ever find it. 

UP-UPDATE:  Is this really an auction game?  The bidding is resolved in super slo-mo—I slap down some coins, then I have to wait until my next turn to see if I won, or to increase the bid if I didn't.  Then another turn to see how that pans out.  And if you & I get into a bid fight we can easily piss away [i]a third of the entire game[/i] over a single "auction"!  So, no, bid-fighting is just stupid.

After group discussion we settled on this game really being about appraising lots and offering to pay just a little bit more than it's worth to scare everyone else off.  If you undervalue it, you'll have someone come over the top and then it's probably best to wave off instead of sticking in and putting those resources out of the game for the bulk of the session.  If you overvalue it you're spending out inefficiently and will lose the game to someone who shaves it just a hair closer.  The goal is to "Baby Bear" it and get it juuust right so no one else wants to spend the extra +1 coin yet you end up paying an efficient minimum for it.

Don't let all the thought and discussion fool you—[i]I hate this game.[/i]

Honest.

:shake:

UP-UP-UPDATE:  Final score—110, 110, 105.  Guess who got 105?

Played with 5 players. It was a bit long for what it is. Rules are easy to learn and it's a tactic game. The lack of different strategies to gain VP or the inexistence of a final scoring makes it a light game, almost without planning. The 1st player never changes and I don't understand why. Some people talk about the 1st player advantage. How? He is always overbided! The last player has always a huge advantage chosing the ports he wants, guaranteeing them... And if almost all the others went to the "take money" action, he gains a huge amount of merchandise for peanuts. Changing the 1st player would add more interesting situations on the game. I tried it! Far better with the token moving changing the order.

An underrated auction game.  Simple to learn and play.  Highly interactive.  Scales very well from 2 to 5 players.  The only problem is that if you don't set the price high enough (happens often with new players), you've effectively wasted your action.

It's too bad they didn't put this beautiful artwork on a more deserving game...

A really elegant bidding game with the tactile satisfaction of shuffling chips like a casino game that just feels right. Pro: It's easy to teach and jump into playing.

Great artwork and high quality components. Easy to teach and is a decent light game for gamers and IMOP good for non-gamers looking for something new. My main problem with the game is that what was a fantastic opportunity for theme was not developed and what little there is present seems to get lost in the mechanics.

RATING: 3
Bid on items, which you meld for pts, to buy victory pt-cards. Terrific auction mechanic, where you have option to "back out" if at least one other player is present, but must pay if you're left the only one. Sweet. Allows some "take that" but not too much. Nice Carcassone-like feature you have to figure out how to "back out" to get your 'boats' back in order to bid on other stuff. 
Game is kind of like a fancy Ra or Amen-Re; I think I prefer just to play those. Like that game, CN can be played "family" or "cut throat" style. Or maybe Aladdin's Dragon's better comparison.
As expected from DOW, terrific pieces, and large plastic coins make it easy to see who's current high bidder at a glance. But the board, full of elaborate but superfluous disneyesque art, cluttering your visual field. (I'm all for atmosphere--but not at the expense of game play. E.g.by contrast Ghost Stories similar art works wonderfully in that game.)
Downtime was too much with five players. One guy went and bought McDonalds before his turn came around again (though to be fair, we were playing in a food court).  And also the card purchase is too "mathy" for my tastes, since each turn you have to calculate the optimal way of grouping the items you've bought; this middle-school  math problem just isn't enjoyable for me.

Very simple game with beautiful pieces. The theme is sort of lost and feels 'tacked on', but overall this is a fairly fun bidding game. After just one group play with 3 people, I haven't figured out much of a strategy yet aside from trying to block others from out bidding you, and part of the problem comes when you spend several rounds trying to outbid your opponents, the game ends.

Played a 3 player game. Very good looking game. Not many new mechanics here, but the gameplay is solid. There is a kingmaker potential, but this is somewhat offset by the ability to press your luck on the black market and maybe buy the higher victory point cards. The syndicate card encourages players to block bids. I thought this was nifty.

Read the rules. It seems like at least an okay game. It is largely worker placement, you collect goods to trade in (either all different, or all the same) to acquire victory point cards.

 A few odd design elements probably hold this back from being a great gamer's game. There are 6 unique VP cards that have a better goods-to-points ratio making their collection a bit of a race/crap-shoot. Although the tension they add is probably good. There are 3 special types of VP cards that give in-game benefit but a worse goods-to-points ratio. These seem pretty unbalanced to me. 

I fear that the game will not feel fresh at all after 2 plays. There's not a lot of depth and no real variety in one game to the next. The decision space doesn't seem interesting enough to sustain multiple plays. Unless there's a lot more fun in the shrewd decision making and set collection aspects.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not sure if the rating would go up or down with additional play. Definitely a fun and interesting system, but not sure how well the mechanic of raising bids works, seems like there's too much "boom or bust" potential - you put a ship down with a bid and maybe you get 3 tiles next turn or maybe you get squat. It also strikes me as too much of a turn-order dependency to have only 1 copy each of the big point cards, but I didn't spend the time to figure out if that matters much - there definitely are some cases where 2 smaller cards are as good as 1 large card.

I would love to see what Knizia would do if asked to optimize this game. The idea of multiple concurrent auctions seems like something he could really turn into gold.

RATING: 5
I wanted to like this game if not for anything else than the superb graphic design. Unluckily, I have to go with the majority opinion that Cargo Noir is a disappointing release. The development curve will be samey each play. The first half of the game is an uninteresting buildup of players' engines from a choice of only three special abilities, in the second half players are trying to collect the most valuable set. Likely, the winner will be the one who gets challenged in his key bids less than others. Some luck of the draw on the black market can help as well. Another unnecessary game that can be lost but not won by your own decisions.

Just found this at BGG CON 2017. Fun bidding system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Again, I have to go along with the BGG conventional wisdom - it is an admirable effort, and I am glad that Days of Wonder insisted on a different theme than boring old European trading, but ultimately I think that the game lacks challenge and sufficient depth to be a keeper.  

The gold standard for family games is Ticket to Ride, a gateway game that provides a challenge to even the most seasoned game player and definitely rewards the better player.  Cargo Noir is definitely approachable by just about anyone, but it doesn't seem like there's that much to be discovered.

So it is a pleasant diversion, and it lasts just about the right length of time (with 3 players, at least), but I don't foresee a game of this type fulfilling any purpose meaningfully in my collection.  For an intro game I would choose something else, for a meatier game I would also choose something else.

While many people really like the bande dessiné type artwork (which definitely goes a long way in establishing the very thin theme), I still don't care for it, since it still reinforces many of the boardgame/nerd stereotypes especially regarding the depiction of women.  For this reason I don't think I'd really play this with my kids either.

RATING: 7
This was actually much more fun than I expected.  There is a lot of strategy in where and when you place ships.  I can see this one being played often.

Okay.  Interestingly, we played something wrong on the first play.  After correcting the error and trying it, I have lowered my rating from 8 to 7.  Can that be right?

Perhaps a house rule to fix one bug in the previous erroneous play and it will be a better game.

This was an initial hit after Gamestorm 2012.  It quickly lost it's luster though.  There aren't too many decisions to make and the strategy is very samey.

Very interesting mechanics here at play. A worker placement auction game that allows for a lot of player interaction. The player interaction may be a turnoff to most as the game can end up where two player's cannibalize one another, allowing for an uncontested player to gain the upper hand with ease. All information in the game is public allowing for other players to easily discern another's actions which does take away from how good the game could be from a purely strategical standpoint. The game is good for what it is, and one I wouldn't mind playing again.

Out of the box, just reading the rules for the first time,  I was playing the game in 15 minutes.   Great rules design and implementation.  Non gamers had no problems getting into the role.  Table talk and alliances of convenience are a great enhancement to the game, so I enjoyed a 4 player game more than the 2 player. Game speed is a great fast pace, but almost feels like it ends too soon.   New games can appreciate a short game that still has meat to it.

A well-made "nothing special" multi-auction game. But it's produced by Days of Wonder: I guess if a gamer publisher published it it would have fit in a small box as a card game possibly with 5-5 colorful small cubes instead of boats. It feels much like Merchants: Lords of the Sea which came in a small box. But on the other hand, it has simple and clear rules and a look attractive for non-gamers as well. So it might function as a gateway to heavier games using these mechanism elements, and in this aspect this game functions really well.

Cargo Noir is a strange bird. As evidence by its many forum posts related to how exactly a turn should proceed, the game is quite possibly the most unintuitive game I have ever played. Don't get me wrong, the rules are quite easy once you grasp them, but its the grasping that seems like it is the most difficult thing to do in this game. You are basically a smuggler looking to buy "commodities" at various ports around the world which you will then turn in to buy other things that will make you the most opulent smuggler of the bunch. I generally like bidding games, and I must say this one is an intriguing one and one that i will hopefully play again soon. But in terms of being the best bidding game, this certainly isn't. Might be the prettiest though. Per usual for Days of Wonders all of the components are top notch, and the graphic design is some of the best in the business.

variante:

Chaque joueur reçoit au début de la partie sa fiche de famille, ses trois cargos et ses sept pièces de monnaies comme dans la règle de base mais aussi un jeton de marchandise qui est choisi en rapport avec l’origine de sa famille qu’il pose sur le premier emplacement de ses entrepôts. Chaque famille possède donc un avantage à traffiquer sa marchandise favorite.

La répartition de base se fait ainsi : 

Al Kabash (Tanger) 3 cargos + 7 pièces de monnaies + un jeton de marchandise “joyaux”. 

Casa Nostra (New York): 3 cargos + 7 pièces de monnaies + un jeton de marchandise “voitures”. 

Kali Pakora (Bombay): 3 cargos + 7 pièces de monnaies + un jeton de marchandise “ivoire”. 

Ti Pot Tong (Hong-Kong) 3 cargos + 7 pièces de monnaies + un jeton de marchandise “antiquités”. 

Tres Sombreros (Panama) : 3 cargos + 7 pièces de monnaies + un jeton de marchandise “cigares”. 

De plus, chaque famille recevra de la banque un bonus lorsque celle-ci arrivera à revendre une ou plusieurs marchandises du type dont elle a forgée sa réputation. Le bonus sera de une pièce de monaie par jeton de son type!

A light worker placement style game where you place your workers to bid on certain spots. Unlike other auction games, placing a bid is an action, so I like that this causes people to have to bid with caution and when doing so bid rather high. The set collection part, while the main variety in this game, I feel like is a bit too random for my liking. The components of this game are quite varied in quality, with the ships you use as workers being on the upper end and the sheet that you place your items being extremely flimsy.

A fun, tight game. There's not enough time to do everything you'd like, but the game is always satisfying. There are plenty of opportunities for screwage if you pay attention to what others are collecting. There is an interesting push-your-luck element, as bidding low on a harbour could net some cheap cargo, but could also result in a protracted bidding war (which costs time and opportunity for all involved). Conversely, bidding too high on a harbour leaves you strapped for cash and unable to bid high again in the future. Calls for "greater interactivity" in this game are unwarranted, and smack of uncreative players who can't invent a strategy, but need a card to explain the strategy to them.

Not a bad game at all.  Having said that, I'd be willing to play again, but will likely won't suggest it myself and definitely won't be buying it.  We already have some good worker placement games and this just doesn't bring enough originality to the table.  The set collection and bidding up for the different ports is fun.  Components are VERY nice, and the art is great.  Cloth bag sucks (comes apart) with the first batch of them, but word on the street is that DoW will replace it if you contact them.

I think this is a great game for some people, just not for someone who has already played a lot of this "worker placement" stuff.  Just doesn't "wow" you if you've seen how this mechanic works.

An auctioning game that we played many times, and one which we never felt had sufficient balance for the player going first.  We gave it many tries, and I have played it with different sets of people - and it always played out that way.  Not bad mechanics, necessarily, otherwise... but that first player disadvantage made it not fun.  Sat for a long time according to my "MUST AMASS SIZABLE GAME LIBRARY" strategy which didn't account for, you know, the space taken up by such an endeavor.  Sold at auction.

Sadly, this is way too simple for its own good.  All of the items are interchangeable, so there is no reason to compete for gold more than cigars, for example.  The auctions are straightforward.  While the art is good and it may be good for the younger crowd, there just isn't much game here.

One of those Days of Wonder games that is good on many level but in the end just not great enough to see it hit the table enough. 

Bidding is emplyed in an interesting way as the players seek to acquire goods via illegal means at ports of the world. They then look to convert their illicit goods into cash to acquire luxuries and expand their criminal organisation. 

As always for DoW the game is gorgeous to look at but it is a tight game indeed and the turns fly by.

Solid little base hit of a board game that gets out of the way and doesn't overstay its welcome... assuming 4 players or less.  Would make a good 2-player game, which makes it ideal for people who love Ra but can't get 3 players to the table.

But $50?  For this?  God, I'm becoming That Guy around here, but this game costs this much because it's over-produced by a factor of 5.  No need for this much plastic.

RATING: 8
Maybe not quite balanced in who goes first. Also, it's probably worth counting tiles. Otherwise, it's a nice game with a few different legit strategies that seem best when depending on your opponent's actions (read: no obvious Nash equilibrium). I also love the drama of drawing the perfect (or perfectly terrible) tile. The syndicate helps with feeling too screwed by malicious opponents.

This is a very pretty game - the components are top quality, with excellent, eye-catching art and decoration. The cards are brightly illustrated (and enourmous: 65x100mm).
The game is fairly light, certainly easy to teach, and plays fast. It is to long to be considered a filler, but certainly not deep. It [i]is[/i] an ideal gateway game.
Unlikely that I will play it again except with new gamers, or perhaps to teach.

RATING: 3
Played once (5 player). very slow and boring. Took almost 2 hours with no tough decisions. The strategy is scripted - everyone wants to get 5 ships as soon as possible. Flat gameplay, each turn is like the previous. Lots of downtime with 5 - you can wander off for 5 minutes and it doesn't matter - you can't plan ahead because the board will have changed completely by the time it comes back to you.

It is thematically sanitised (No drugs, no sex-slavery, no illegal immigration, though they do have weapons and Uranium), but I guess that's what you'd expect for a family game. I'd strongly recommend playing Ticket to Ride instead of Cargo Noir to any 'casual'/family gamers. Or Dominion, Carcassonne, Settlers.

A simple game that surprised me on the upside. You get to allocate all your workers each round on missions to collect tiles, either all different (which will score on a geometric scale) or all the same (which will score on the better 'squared' scale but is commensurately harder to complete). On two spots you get stuff for free - get more money and draw a random tile (or swap a tile). On all the others you put down a bid for the tiles on display and if no one has overbid you by your next turn, then you pay up and collect. Which of course can be painful if you consistently think you've bid enough only to find out you haven't, but also provides the requisite tension. You eventually trade in your goods and buy VP cards, some of which provide special powers like extra spaces to hold tiles, an extra worker and my personal favourite because it turns a continual downer into a positive, get money when you're overbid. Do it a bunch of rounds, see who has the most VPs. Turns are quick. There's some assessment of what people might be able to pay in bids next round but which can't be overly long because for latter players you don't know if they'll be overbid and get their money back for new bids. It goes the right length of time, the rules are easy, the Tintin type artwork is fantastic and adds to the game's pleasant vibe.

Wow- a deeper game than it appears. I wayyyy screwed up the rules too.

Enjoyed very much, even with some rule errors. I think this could be a favored game for me, when I get the rules right.

Clarification as reminder to myself and others:

1. When trading, you either trade in sets where
- all match (we did this right), or
- every tile MUST be different

2. Each player plays through all three phases, before play goes to next player. We were playing each phase, then going to next. This would basically almost eliminate any player order advantage.

3. This clarification, that I need to study a bit more- "On the LAST turn, after you've cashed in your cargo for as many points in Victory Spoils Cards as you can, use any leftover coins that you didn't use for supplementing the Card purchases to BLOCK as many PORTS as you can. If you have THREE coins left and your opponent is sitting in Hong Kong on a stack of TWO coins, slide on in there and block them from getting that cargo!"

This is a fast-paced bidding game that reminded me a little of Nefertiti (in its fast-paced-bidding-game-ness, the games don't have much else in common).  Because turns are as valuable a commodity as money in this game, it really hurts to get stuck in a protracted bidding war with someone, which really encourages players to bid what they think things are worth.  It's a set collection game where everyone is going for different things at different times, and you're bidding on lots, which always makes for some interesting bidding strategies.  I thought this one was a lot of fun, but don't get caught over-analyzing things here.

A clever auction and set collection game. Your ships contain a bid for tiles at a location which may be countered by other players. A bidding war ties up your limited actions for extra turns. So it is wise to bid what you will think the tiles are worth to you.
The tiles are assembled into sets, progressively more valuable that allow you to buy luxuries (aka victory points) or add ships, warehouse holding space to retain goods between turns or give some money when withdrawing a bid.

The components ships/coins artwork are top notch as you could expect from a DoW published games. Its basic mechanics are simple but there are clever moves you can make. A nice accessible family game.

After hearing this game get trashed by basically everyone, I was very pleasantly surprised. Yes, the theme is pretty pasted-on, but the game itself has some nice medium-weight set collection/bidding mechanics that make for a pretty enjoyable game. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but it definitely doesn't deserve the trashing I see it get all the time. I don't rate games after a single play, but I give this a solid 8 (could even be a 9 with people who love bidding and set collection). I think people got really excited by this because they wanted a thematic game where you really feel like an smuggler and got disappointed when this game completely failed to provide that experience; however, I was happy with the gameplay experience it did provide.

As always, Days of Wonder has made phenomenal components, but I'm afraid I expected more from the game than what it delivered. I can't help but ask why so much effort was made on the art direction when the theme is so obviously pasted on. There's no detail in your actions and you can even spend the entire game taking the default Macao action and still pull off a win. This works as a very light casual game, and perhaps Days of Wonder marketed it that way, but the components and price tag suggested otherwise to me.

Worker (ship) placement in various "black markets" around the world, auctioning for the cargo there, then set collection to trade cargo for cards that deliver victory points (and may also provide benefits -- such as money, additional storage capacity, or additional ships). Nothing groundbreaking from a game play standpoint. Great theme and artwork, with simple rules. We played without the option of drawing a tile from the bag when in the Macao bkack market -- it just seemed that strategy could trump bidding at the ports. Simple rules, but can be played deep. Turn order is very important and must be factored into your plans. Looking forward to trying out additional strategies next time.

RATING: 8
I love this game because it's a race to collect sets of cargo: time is of the essence and when your opponent ups the bid on a port you really want, not only does it become more expensive, but it also delays in scoring - which can really put a dent in your plans.  This is a medium light game that has turned out to be one of our favorites. The graphics are spectacular, the coins and the ships are wonderful, all adding to an excellent gaming experience.  Great job DOW!!

UPDATE: Been playing this game with 2 players exclusively.  Recently had a chance to play with 4 players.  Downtime was kind of an issue.  With 4 players I would have to rate this game as a 7.  The game is great with 2 players.  Bit of advice: In a 2 player game, open up an extra 3 cargo port during setup.  This makes for a much better game.

Great components and aesthetic style.  Game play is okay.  Not a great game, not a bad game.  But I think I'd rather play something like Alhombra, which is equally accessible, somewhat similar in the overall goal of 'collect lots of these, try and prevent opponent from collecting lots of those' and yet just feels so much more engaging and rewarding.

A party game about smuggling in Macau, mainly set collection. As a party game it's a little bit hard for non-gamers to learn the sequence of play, however it'd be all fine after two or three rounds. The real problem is down-time. In a 5-player game, one will wait very long for other players finishing their three-phase resolution plus necessary or unnecessary pondering. And one thing, why is the Casino always losing money?

Routine but solid bidding/worker-placement game with a rich theme and beautiful components. 

Yes, the game has its problems - the last player of the round seems to receive a slight advantage over the other players as the starting player token never moves (and, consequently, the starting player has a slight disadvantage compared to the others), there's heavy downtime between turns (especially in a five player game), and its difficult to formulate long-term strategies due to its randomness of tile distribution (though tactics is ever present).

All that being said, the game is surprisingly easy to learn, making the game very accessible to gamers and non-gamers alike due to its rather basic mechanics that - though simple - have opportunities for clever tactics that even new players will discover during their first play. 

Despite its imperfections, it's a solid choice as a gateway game since it's both accessible and fun - and the beautiful components help the accessibility immensely!

I like the general feel of the game trying to optimise the cargo types (set collecting) while attempting to spoil the moves of others.

Component quality is very good, the detail on the ships is top notch.

A total letdown - there's nothing Noire about this game at all. Beautiful art (as is usual from DoW). Somewhat boring and frustrating set completion mechanics. Zero player interaction - this is the first game I've played in ages where people were getting up and leaving the table after their turns were over. It honestly just feels unfinished or in need of an expansion. I'm going to give it one more play before I sell it, and that's only out of respect for DoW as a game company and not because I like the game.

I'd say it's a great intro game for new gamers as Cargo Noir is the one responsible for getting me addicted!

RATING: 6
This one falls into the light strategy family game genre that I usually enjoy the most.  Typical beautiful Days of Wonder production.  To start, I'm not completely sold on the game.  It was enjoyable to play, but there isn't much for me to do while I wait for my turn.  It's a simple set-collection, auction game that might just grow on me ...

RATING: N/A
Interesting. Seems a bit like Princes of Florence and Colosseum. Both decent games with nice mechanisms that fall a bit short of very good games in my opinion. Does Cargo Noir fit the bill of ideal game in this genre? Or, as is likely, am I way off the mark on this?

Exactly what I expected from this - which wasn't much. It's got a drawn-out auction system. On top of that, it's really just set collection, one of my least favorite (and most bland) mechanics out there. It's not a bad game and I wouldn't mind playing, but there's just really nothing to offer. I guess it does have nice components, but that's about it.

------------------------------------
I really want to like this game, but it goes on for far too long for the weight it is, which seems to be largely down to the approach to turn structure within the game, which feels like it could be heavily optimized.

Which is to say, next time I play, we'll be changing the structure to:
 - Each round, players take turns retrieving then placing their ships, evaluating as usual. They do NOT do spending.
 - At the end of each round, players simultaneously figure out how much spending power they have & buy stuff. Conflicts broken by player order.

Its' minor, but not waiting for people to faff around doing the math of what they can buy between every turn seems like it'll make a massive difference ^^.

RATING: 6
A multiple-simultaneous-auction set-collection game. It works pretty well, there are some decisions to be made, and the ships are awfully cute, but I'm just not a huge fan of auctions -- and that's almost all this is. There is also a luck element -- it's nice when you can draw exactly the tile(s) you need from the bag! -- that some people may not like. At least it plays pretty quickly!

--- Summary ---
The board shows a variable (by player number) number of ports, each with 1-4 slots for goods tiles; a black market; and a casino. Players start with 10 coins and 3 ships. On your turn, inorder:
1. in any order, resolve previously placed ships: market = 2 coins; casino = either draw random tile from bag or exchange one of your tiles with one on display; port = if you were overbid, either cancel bid (take back money and ship) or raise bid (add cash to bid); if you have high bid, take back ship and all goods tiles on that port (replenish tiles immediately from bag; if bag empty, place all spent/discarded tiles into bag)
2. trade in sets of goods (for set of like goods, value = size squared; for set of all different goods, value = triangle progression 1 3 6 10 etc.) for cards (some give you bonuses like more ships, more storage space, or coins when overbid; most are only for VP, with higher VP:coin ratios with more costly cards). At end of this step, discard all tiles exceeding your storage space.
3. place all your ships (with coins showing your bid) onto ports/market/casino spaces on board; if another bidder already in port, must bid higher

Game ends after 10 or 11 rounds (by player number); on LAST round only, may use coins to help pay for VP cards. Most VP wins.

Probably too much luck here to rate higher and might last a tad too long, but still enjoyable as a lighter game.  Might be a bit too complicated for a family game, so it's in that Twilight Zone area where it tried appealing to casual and serious gamers and winds up somewhere in the middle.

I feel bad complaining about this game being overproduced but it is ; especially when you realized it could be a card game with some token.  Great art as usual by Coimbra.

The gameplay is simple and the flow is smooth.  It is bidding and set collecting in their most basic form.  At the same time, the game is a little too long for such a simple offering.

Once you realize the game has 2 resources ; money and time (number of turns), it loses most of its appeal.

Only played 1 time. It took half the game to really get a good grip on things, but the second half was really fun. 

Some people say there are no player interaction but I guess it depends on the group. Sure you can do your own thing and have no interest in what the other players are doing. But if you keep a sharp eye, you can block your opponents and force them to take less than optimal moves.

Update: Played a few more times. The game offer some interesting choices for the casual gamers. The turn limit puts a constraint on how much you want to waste turns raising the stakes. You also have to balance getting more money, more ships, more space and syndicate with the need to score big points.

The game can be boring if people take it too seriously. It is a light casual game. I had two players analyse it to death and come up with a strategy that left everybody else at the table with nothing much to do during their turn. The strategy worked quite well and they won, but made for a boring game.

It is not a game that you will play every night, but once in a while is provides good fun.

The turn order is a bit unintuitive at first, but a turn or two will clear all the confusion.

Enjoyable and fast played auction game. Getting outbid and having to wait another turn is frustrating, but that just adds to the tension when estimating how much you bid in the first place.

After two plays, I'm disappointed in this one. I really wanted to like Cargo Noir, which has beautiful components and simple mechanics. However, it has a number of issues that trouble me. The largest problem is that in a five-player game, two people are not able to buy their second extra boat. Boats are actions, so that means those two players get something like five to seven fewer turns than the other players. That's a HUGE disadvantage. Admittedly, there's an easy fix for this, but it's a terrible design decision. The problems don't end there, however. I believe turn order is an issue, with the earlier players in much better position, especially in the final turn when they've already collected their final goods and can send their ships out simply to harass the later players. The game also suffers from king-maker issues. I guess this works as light family fare, but more experienced game players are going to spot the flaws.

Worker-based bidding isn't new, but I suspect it will be the hot mechanism for 2011.  It keeps the board crowded and the options tight.  It's too bad Cargo Noir isn't a great game, because the bidding itself works.  The rest  is a very standard set-collection affair and it's a bit slow.  I love the theme, but the components--especially the wily modular boards--are a disappointment from this publisher.

I won this in the Gaming Hoopla Games For Gold raffles that benefit the American Cancer Society. Thanks Grant for doing these.

It's a fun light bidding game. Not sure what the talk about down time it as I don't see it. I guess you could have some APers drag this down but that's not the game's fault. 

I wish someone would figure out how to adapt their bidding games to work with 2 players better. This one doesn't and the bidding "wars" are pretty much non-existent making the fun part of this game...no fun.

Love the theme, the components, the mechanics... but the game play seems broken!

I really hope, that we just read the rules wrong, since it feels like the auction mechanics is broken and is working against the game. Going into an auction over several rounds will simply result in a setback that is hard to recover from.

Wish there were alternative rules that would fix the game play.

In Serge Laget's Cargo Noir – his fourth standalone box game from Days of Wonder – players represent "families" that traffic in smuggled goods in a 1950s noir setting. Each turn, you'll set sail to various ports where cargo is known to get "lost" for the right price – Hong Kong, Bombay, Rotterdam, New York and more – and you'll make an offer for the goods on display. If another family then offers more in that port, you'll need to up your bid or take your money and slink away to look for goods elsewhere. Stand alone in a port, though, and you'll be able to discretely move the goods from the dock to your personal warehouse. Says Laget in a press release accompanying the game announcement, "Everything in Cargo Noir grew from a core auction mechanism that is simple and trivial to explain – you can only bid up, and the last bidder standing gets the goods."

Once you collect goods, you can trade them in to add more ships to your fleet – allowing you to scout for wares in more locations – purchase Victory Spoils, or take other actions. The more goods you collect, the more valuable they can be. The player with the most Spoils at game end wins.

RATING: 7
Cargo Noir was widely panned by gamers when it first arrived on the North American shores for being an inferior followup to the critically acclaimed Ticket to Ride. DoW was trying hard to develop games that were easy to learn and yet retained the depth necessary to attract serious gamers. With TtR, they achieved the perfect balance of ease of play while retaining the complexity of choice.
Cargo Noir is by no means a failure by Laget as it achieves both simplicity of play but also incorporates a tremendous amount of depth and subtlety in decision-making: too subtle indeed, that it actually morphs into the game's greatest weakness. With TtR, the options and choices for each turn to build track is vast as one can build anywhere on the board. However, the destination is never in doubt. Players know where to build and how to get there. The tension lies in when to build. The objectives are clearly laid out and the strategy is easily visualized even by casual first time players. 

This however, is not true at all for Cargo Noir. In fact, while each round, the choices seem simple, the objectives are not always that clear. Is it better to go all into port for personal gain, or is it more fruitful to block an opponent's purchase? As with all "auction" style games, determining the value of a particular action, choice or purchase in the context of the game and its players is really tough for serious gamers, much less beginners. With casual, or infrequent gamers, it is extremely challenging for players to figure out how many coins to invest for a particular good. Each option seem muddied by the inability to properly gauge the value of a particular action. To top it off, player personalities will also determine how aggressive and often bidding  showdown occurs. In some cases, aggression is absolutely necessary to avoid a runaway victory or an unchallenged bid. This is a tall order for newbies and it ruins the game. All players need to recognize the value of the goods in the context of an opponent's needs. This is not an easy task and is an exercise of frustration for newbies to the game. 
 
I believe that if veteran gamers really give Cargo Noir a chance and played with a steady group of friends, this game really has a chance to shine after a half dozen plays. Enough time needs to be spent on understanding the relationship between money, goods, points and player personalities to be successful in the game. In this sense, Laget and DoW failed to develop an accessible game in the vein of Ticket to Ride.

Simple bidding, set collection game. You have a limited number of actions, where you either bid, raise, or drop out of an area which contains a random set of goods. Other actions allow you to get more cash, to exchange one good for another to help make sets, or randomly grab goods from the bag.

Correcting our rules error definitely fixes the problem of repeatedly going to the black market, randomly drawing from the bag, and handing in easy sets of miscellaneous 9. However, my feelings really haven't changed much about the game. It's better than it was, but it's still just an average game.

This was completely not what I was expecting. The theme and promotions leading up to the game's release made it seem like an organized crime game, such as Bootleggers or Blood Feud in New York.

Instead, it's a fairly simple auction and set collection game. There is very little about Cargo Noir that feels like smuggling, as all you do is bid on and collect tiles to trade in for Victory Points. It's a horribly tacked on theme and I think the game suffers for it, probably missing it's target audience. If it had been about bidding and acquiring art, ancient treasures or anything else people collect I think it would be far more popular than it is.

Cargo Noir was an interesting combination of set-collecting, worker-placement and auctioning. I think multiple plays will be required to really find solid strategies but there seems to be quite a few different options for players to pursue and smart players will need to learn how to make decisions based upon the other players' choices.

I would certainly like to play this again a few more times to see if it has staying-power.

Economic auction and set collection game of trafficking smuggled goods in shady ports.  The auction mechanic is fun, clever and thematic representing bribe amounts to port authorities to look the other way. There is always something useful at the black market. Fence your goods from plutonium to cigars to upgrade your fleet, smuggle more cargo, and ultimately buy victory point spoils.  Buying special Victory Point Spoils to strut your indulgent wealth adds so much fun and banter with the other players and makes the game winning condition so much more interesting than the usual and dull climb up a static victory point track.

Days of Wonder is known for it’s game with great components. This is also the case with Cargo Noir. But the inlay. Where in other games of DoW, everything fits perfectly in the provided inlay, in Cargo Noir this is not the case. To get everything inside the box you can do two things. One is to throw away the inlay, and the other is to adjust the inlay using a knife. We choose for the second option. This was a big disappointment in this game, and is something of which we’re not used to when it handles about a DoW game. Anyway, playing the game. The game is very easy, and each round consists of three steps. One is dispatch your ships. Secondly place bids next to the ships and three, collect goods if you’ve won the bid. This is the game in a nutshell. Not a great game, but it’s not a punishment to play it. But I Wonder if we’re going to play it again one Day.

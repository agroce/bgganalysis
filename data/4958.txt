I don't owned it.

Played in the far year of 2006 with  two teams- two players each ( 2 germans+ 2 allies); several weeks of campaign. A memorable experience.

My first try of a hex & counter wargame with other player(s). Lots of fun and I have a blast with it!

All that network of roads, villages, bridges, forests, rivers ..... where to defend ... and the germans are coming!!

The high mobility of units and the non-stiky EZocs made a very dinamic game.

I hope to repeat soon.

I like the SCS series but this is my least liked game in the series. The Ardennes specific rules change the standard rules too much for my taste. And it seems that all the rule changes really screw over the Germans.

I have yet to play a Bulge game I like.  Don't get the appeal.  In the case of this game, the "traffic jam" rules, where you have to pre-plan all the moves for all units lest they cost extra MPs if they cross over each other, killed the joy.  Realistic?  Probably very realistic, which is why I avoid Bulge games.

Un jeu somptueux avec deux magnifiques cartes et des pions classiques qui vont très bien avec.
Ne pas faire comme moi en commençant de suite par la campagne. Il faut jouer les scénarios 5.1 et 5.2 pour optimiser l'attaque allemande des premiers tours et comprendre les enjeux stratégiques.
La campagne, et c'est le problème de SCS en général, est très, trop longue à jouer, surtout que les interactions sont nulles entre les deux joueurs. Du coup l'Américain peut attendre une longue heure avant de pouvoir pousser un pion.
Autre problème, c'est un jeu d'attaque défense en début de partie. Si l'Allemand n'est pas allé assez loin, il peut abandonner ce qui prive l'Américain de contre attaquer et de passer sa partie à attendre puis ne pas jouer...Les scénarios sont peut être mieux à deux...

Part of The Gamers SCS series of games.  A Playable covering of the Germans Ardennes offensive that will not take months to finish.  The game captures the road net problems experienced by the German forces as well as the requirement of U.S. forces throwing out small blocking formations to buy time for more powerful reinforcements to arrive.  Has good replay value.

Well, I've seen each side win, over my dead body. At times, a little fiddly. I like the weather mechanism which makes the game unpredictable. Don't like the combination of series and game rules which causes reinforcements to come in on one hex only where they can get crowded by the enemy and then have to fight their way in against superior numbers (the answer being fight better early on, I guess). Like the Greif rules; maybe I can port them and the weather and air points to Bitter Woods.

A solid game that captures a lot of the spirit of the Battle of the Bulge. Set up could have been cleaner and faster with the coordinates printed on the counters. Of course this would be for the December 16th scenarios.

RATING: 7
Hits the right level of rules weight for SCS - complex enough to offer possibilities, not so complex that it turns into OCS-lite.  Its fatal flaw is the "Paris" option for the Axis, which, absent the Meuse to cross on-map, is awfully hard to stop.  Still a fun 2-session game.

I played this game years ago as a team game. It was a very interesting playing session. I have re-acquired it.

Pros: easy to learn rules; it allows for team play; it has enough "bulge" rules to give it bulge flavour.

Cons: too generic; big scenarios don't match with lite rules; long to play.

One of my favorites and I play this game often, mostly solo. Good looking components, and an easy system which is still a lot of fun and a challenge to play right. Even the small scenarios, showing the start of the offensive, are a great puzzle to solve and a good way for testing your game opening moves.

RATING: 1
Completely unrealistic. Scale is all wrong for the unit size,  ZOC and lack of forced combat rules. You can not set up the historical defense lines with the historical number of units, try it and the enemy will infiltrate through your lines, or if you spread out, they can concentrate and blast the now weaker stacks.   The worst Bulge game I ever played, close to being the worst game period 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Better than other SCS offerings and your first game may actually look quite a bit like the historical campaign, but the "hit and run" tactics are still there and they drag the game down.  The German supply "pockets" are also rather ahistorical, though a house rule requiring them to trace a line of supply to the German map edge fixes that problem.

Like most SCS games, it is fairly large in size, which removes some of the advantages of lessened complexity.

An excellent Standard Combat Series game.  The game is more fluid than other similar Bulge games in the market because of the much simpler but effective rules and system.  ZOC is not locking as was in other games.  You simply pay 2 MPs to move in and move out at no cost.  This mean we have a good and competitive Bulge game at last.  Many chromes are added to add colors and flavours to the game e.g. the Grief team and paratrooper.  The German breakthrough of the U.S. line is very likely given the system design and thus that possibility is lingered from time to time during the campaign.  Supply depends on the use of the road-net by both sides (surely they would stuggle to bring the supply on till the end.)  Reserves placement is crucial to both sides too, whereas only reserve units are capabale of exploitation after the supply check (as it is different from the series rule in terms of supply check in the sequence of play and the limited expliotation-capable units identified in other series games.)  With a detailed Order of Battle, this Bulge game breaks the traditional perception of a campaign being bored and slow.  On the other hand, this game brings out the some of the very true simulation of the actual intense scenario, e.g. the Pieper breakthorugh.  I whole-heartedly recommend this game.

Despite some negative comments here I think Ardennes is a solid game on the topic of the battle of the Bulge. While there is a possibility for the supply 'hedgehog' approach I do not think it is such a game winning tactic. I like the unit scale, upping it will create more problems and give a non historical game. The lack of zoc is more a feature than a drawback (sorry Phil) once put in context with terrain and supply. It is not the definitive game on the subject but it give reasonable detail, speed, and hindsights. 

I think I like Ardennes a bit more than Ardennes 44.

Make no mistake, compared to the Bugle monster and mini-monster games out there, this is a "Bulge flavoured" game. That said, I believe this is the most enjoyable of the lot, given the trade off between history and ease of play. While a tad big, this game has much of the simplicity of the Gamers' SCS system (not many special rules) and experienced players should motor right along. Hey, new players will do fine, its just that Dean Essig designs usually have a catch, and it may take a little while to discover it.

Its certainly the best SCS game, hands down.

HINT: As the German: overrun, overrun, then overrun some more. Even at 1 to 2 on the CRT there is about a 50% chance of success (against your garden variety US Army regimental speed bump.) You want to turn and burn to victory, you have attack all the time and take chances.

Need to try again, but with the rules as written, the supply rules are awful.  German supply units allow the Germans to form massive pockets of units that will never be out of supply unless they let the supply unit get destroyed.  Also - Germans seem very mobile and able to rush thru the Ardennes pretty easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very nice game in many ways, but the German supply rules are wrong headed, as are the stacking rules.  At this scale stacking should be 3-4 points, not 6.  In fact, at this map scale, the game should have been battalion scaled instead of regiment, with half day turns in lieu of full day turns.  One nice feature of full day turns is you get to play through Jan 1 and hit the full US counter attack.

A good SCS games. The early part of the battle is the most interesting. As the Germans your units always seem to be tied up in traffic and can't quite get to where you need them. As the American you barely have enough units to cover your roadblocks and the losses really hurt.
With the campaign game - the Germans need to take the Liege/Meuse option - to drive south there is not enough allied forces to counter.  

The only house rule I would recommend would be the German supply dumps are road bound and must trace by road back to the east map edge without a ZOC or they can't move. Solves the moving pocket problem, and makes crossroad towns even more important.

One of the best SCS games if not the best. It has tension, strategy, need of long term vision and fantastic play for both sides. As the German, if you get a sudden death victory, probably you are the best wargamer ever or your opponent is like an amoeba. Try to get and keep the more victory cities as you can. 16 tutrns can become an eternity for the German player. As the US, try to move your forces as fast as you can in order to close all the possible ways out. Take advantage of your infantry units that move superfast even on rough terrain, this is a great advantage because Germans are slaves of the road net. Once US close the roads, just keep Bastogne and victory is yours in a 90% of chances. A must have.

My favorite bulge game.  Putting the Germans in reserve at the right time is the key to this game. Also, the volksgrenadier divisions are brittle but can be effective in attack in the right conditions.  The one turn per day scale gives this game a more bulge-like feel than ardennes'44.  This one produced a more historical result than all the other bulge games i've tried. Plus, the SCS is a fun system to play.

RATING: 8
Ok, disclaimer, my name is on the playtester list.  Still one of my favorite "games" and a valid simulation to boot.

The feel of the first several days is superb.  The SCS system rewards "action" (combat/exploitation) but the reserve rules reward planned actions as opposed to a helter-skelter panzer bash.  A successful German player must aggressively push and maneuver their spearheads to the limit -- and that push will result in higher "cardboard casualties" as each roadblock is cracked or the tide finally grinds to a halt.  The Allied player is constantly plugging holes/creating roadblocks and desperately glancing at the map edges for arriving units.

The SCS is "simple" but not "simplistic" -- and at this level of simulation, I think Ardennes holds up quite well.  It's a "big" game (by SCS standards) but the size and "chrome" doesn't overwhelm.  It's ideal for someone looking for a playable game that will educate them about the battle.

One of what I consider the best wargame topics. This was the first of the Standard Combat Series games I played, and I expected it to be a little easier than it was.

Played this in 2009 and gave it a 6.5 rating. Having played it again 5 years later I'm raising my rating to 7.5. I found the game played very close to how the bulge ended up and it did so with minimal rules. It is a game and not a pure simulation but its fun and pretty close in my opinion. The reason for the intial 6.5 was the nuisance of the road congestion rule. A house rule passed along from a fellow gamer and the realization this time around that this rule wasn't the pain I first thought made the difference.

Multiple over-powered overruns versus target hexes along a single wintery road killed my 'willing suspension of disbelief' for this game.

Standard SCS series game. Supposedly very good, but suffers from a supply rule for the Germans which permits German units to trace supply to trucks for supply even if the Truck is isolated from the east edge of the map. The supposed tactic is to form a large German hedgehog formation and just slowly move the entire force across the map as a lump, then slide the entire mass of German forces over the Meuse without bothering to maintain any shoulder defence, line of communications to the east, or bothering to hold onto captured terrain.

It is a big improvement over both of my AH games that predate it.

I'm not a fan of Bulge games.  It's one of the more popular WW2 gaming subjects.  However, this is one of the better Bulge games I've played.  It captures the flavor of the German traffic jams well.

Another decent game in the SCS series.  It plays fast.

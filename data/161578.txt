So I attempted to demo this at Essen only have been ridiculed by the oafish designer for not understanding some of the stupid design choices. I was made to feel stupid in front of a group of strangers and had a miserable hour. Judging the game and game alone I can say it was really kinda boring. Kill Doc Lucky with social deduction, nothing special.

A game which can be tremendous fun with the right group. It can also drag if the setup is on the unlucky side, but this is unavoidable with such games. Double blind mechanic is used very well in the game.

RATING: 4
- At first the game seemed fascinating, but after a few rounds it started repeating itself. In a 4-player game, I didn't need a single interrogation to figure out who is on what side. After that the outcome depends on how lucky you are in the rock-paper-scissors.
- The game is unnecessarily complicated to what it needs to be. It's a pity, since with a more streamlined design it would have made a much better game.

Picture the scene in Mission:Impossible were the agents are at a big gala event trying to outwit the other team of rival agents. This is this game. I enjoyed this a lot as it gave funny little moments of spy cinema albeit in a slapstick caper sort of way.

 E.g A spy was sneaking up to the helicopter pad via the stairs, I had already scanned his items due to my spy being in one of the computer rooms as the enemy passed through a security door. 
I had seen that he had a bomb so figured he was going to blow up the helicopter of my team that was on the helipad. 
I garrotted him as he came up and threw him down the stairs where other agents found him and flung him into another room to limp away later. 

Fun times.

RATING: 7
Excellent theme that is incorporated nicely into the feel of the game. The actual gameplay is secondary to the mind games that you can play on the others. The double-blind mechanism during interrogations creates great suspicion and opportunity to bluff.

While the game should be as simple as rock-paper-scissors, it has tons of confusing rules that make it much more complex than you'd expect, making it extremely hard to teach. The game can drag on if the wrong items fall into the hands of the wrong player. Game plays at best with four or six players, which is really limiting.

RATING: 5
Based on 1 play of the intro scenario with 4 players:

I guess it's hard to judge based on the intro scenario alone, but I came away feeling just... indifferent to this game.  It feels like The Castle of the Devil but with a board.  I probably would have liked it a lot more 10 years ago, but I just feel like there's better bluffing/hidden role games out there now. Most of our first game was just us trying unsuccessfully to interrogate each other. The randomness of whether or not you get information out of interrogation really feels like it could make this game drag. I find it hard to imagine playing this over Inkognito.

Not a real big fan of the "Find the MacGuffin" mechanism. The rock-paper-scissor combat just as often leads to a tie as it does a winner. Very few decisions to make during your turn, and half the board is useless! These last two are cardinal sins in my book.

Too bad somebody stole the gameplay. 

[redacted] has a fantastic theme and solid artwork, but it's clunky in odd ways and highly dependant upon luck.  I pulled the exact intel card my team needed out of a locked briefcase, and the other side had no chance from there.  I don't feel my team so much won as the game handed us the victory.

Game of spycraft, intrigue, betrayal, and bluffing set in the golden age of the cold war.In the game, spies must infiltrate the embassy during the reception that the ambassador holds every year to show how important he is. Moving from room to room, they have to recover files and escape in the helicopter, or make sure that the other side's pilots have a really bad day.While interacting with each other, the players seek to interrogate, steal or injure when they can. With a double-blind interaction mechanism that never really lets the tension ebb, a skilled agent will need to do a lot more than see through a bluff.

First order of business: before you even touch the cards, sleeve them.  I know that is not possible, but try. They come new with some of the edges chipped already, and in this game it is critical to not mark the cards.  Mayday purple sleeves fit very tightly, so I actually went with Mayday Premium Orange sleeves so the cards wouldn't bow.

With that out of the way, I have to say this is a very nicely designed game.  I think it is the game I wished Panic Station was.  However, this is a game where all the players need to internalize the rules before it can shine, so plan for a practice game or two before you get to the good stuff.  Fortunately, the game is quick so repeat play isn't hard to do.

RATING: 5
+ cool concept, variety of scenarios, interesting win conditions.
+ under-utilized theme, although Spy Vs Spy could have been so much cooler.
- ridiculously poor usability for the physical components, including the boards and references.  Can anybody see the marking on those doors?  How does this get published in this state?
- dark muddy colors don't help... again, shouldn't an experienced publisher know better?  No excuse.
- some very odd rules which are counter-intuitive with the theme, and mechanically fight against it.
-  feels like there is a good game idea in here, but the whole thing feels rushed and unpolished...  almost a perfect example of everything that is wrong with Kickstarter.
-  what's with the uber-cool [title] and box art?  Makes no sense.

Argh! Will someone *please* revise the rulebook!

The game is great. The rulebook isn't.

In this secret-team game, players are spies of two different nationalities, trying to escape with the other team's intelligence. You do not know who is on your team or who your enemies are, and you move throughout a building trying to find various items.

This game was not bad for the first 45-60 minutes. But our game lasted 2 and a half hours, at which point we agreed to quit. It was terrible. Trying to figure out who is who was somewhat entertaining, but that was over after a while, and we spent the rest of the time just trying to find the right combination of items which would allow one side to win.

I'm told that the game doesn't usually last that long, but there is certainly a decent chance that it will drag on like it did. If the Intel cards happen to be drawn by the wrong team, they can just discard them to prolong the game. If you can't find a bomb and the other team's helicopter is just sitting there, you have no options. It's a stalemate.

On top of this, several of the rules were so arcane and convoluted, about where you go when you lose a fight, and what you can or cannot do in each room. Awful.

For the two player variant, I'd give this one around a 6-6.5 as things get kinda screwy at times.  Full score pending until a four player game has been played.

Edited 5-23-2015 - After playing a four player game earlier tonight, I have to say that the game really shines with more players.  Lots of bluffing, and backstabbing that can be exchanged makes for a really fun gaming experience.

I really enjoyed the interactions, and the double blind interrogation mechanic.  Thought the game could be really fun, but it seems a little bit too random.  Played with several different groups, and every time the winner just seemed kinda random (i got dealt the intel! go).  The story it tells isn't as deep as other games, and the strategy isn't as deep as other games, so why would I play this game?  Idk, I'm sure there is a great game in there somewhere with tweaking the goals or reading peoples tells to know they have something important, but it didn't work for us.

Just played the three-player variant wich did not work.. identities are found out very early but you have to go a lot of items to find out if you play in a team or alone..
So players just keep drawing item cards and scan others to find out if they have any idea with whom they're working.

The "combat" system is not exciting, as is the general flow of the game.. it's rather puzzly.

The four-player game is better than the three-player game, in many ways this reminded me about panic station. And although it's not as complicated or counterintuitive as Panic Station some things just seem incredibly illogic or unthematic.. like i just broke your leg & you're crawling up the stairs, but now i started the ball and suddenly we all teleport to the ball room.

Or when you have to leave a room, "you wanna stay in the observation room..?" Nope.. you can't.. it's in the rules.. but look you could go to the cellar.. have a glass of wine.. relax..

After 1st play, I thought the game reminds me of a more complicated Castle of the Devil.  The basic scenario has two teams and it's a bit difficult to look at anyone's loyalty card.  that information is one-sided as well.  I thought the mechanics on the whole worked rather well, though if one team starts the game with the item(s) they need to win it may be very difficult for the other to stop them.

We had to stop the game because it was dragging. Both peaces of intel had landed on the team it belonged to and it just ended in a back and forth with no real progress by either team. The initial tension was fun, but after that there seemed to be very little interesting gameplay left. 

I only tried it this once, but it seems situations like this are pretty likely to happens. Especially the briefcases seem to prolong the game needlessly. "Wasting" a code cracker and not retrieving a critical item requires the opposite team to go through the entire item deck to again. There are several such game prolonging situation that might occur. Thus i predict that many games will have a tendency to go long.

A game of hidden identity where players will try to learn which players are opponents and which are teammates in order to secure their mission or kill all chances for the enemy. In theory the game is very interesting but in practice based on a single play, it is clear that the rock-paper-scisors fight mechanic too often returns draws and that players must choose to reveal some intel in order to advance the end game. This whould play in 60-90 but could drag for too long.

Traded away for Star Realms.

I've only played this once so far, and the game has a very interesting premise, but the rules were particularly dense and it took us most of the first game to properly understand how to play. As a result, our first playthrough was mostly devoid of bluffing. 

Now that we've got the rules down, I'd like to give this game another shot, since the mechanics themselves were fairly interesting and the combat/interaction system is remarkably implemented.

Some house rules would go a long way towards fixing this one. It's fun when everyone is running around with zero information. The game really shines ian its most chaotic moments. Once players know each other's loyalties it devolves into an annoying take-that game where the inevitable ending just gets delayed over and over again. Perhaps if you could change the rules about calling in helicopters or how walking into an enemy's room ends your turn, this game might actually move at an acceptable pace.

Played in Essen 2014. A must have for deduction game lovers! Secret identities AND a gameboard where you can move around without great restrictions. There are several missions for different numbers of players. Wonderful spy theme with a mass of actions that you can do.

EDIT: After the fourth play I have to reduce my rating from 8 down to 7. We all like the game ... but every time the rulebook has to be taken out and we have to resolve rule problems. That's a bit exhausting. After a while, mostly when something uncommon happens (for example an exploding helicopter), the game really begins and starts to make fun. Before it can absolutely be a pain in the arse.

One of the lucky 1000 people to get into the Kickstarter August 2014. Someone backed out and I grabbed their spot! Not so lucky when it never arrived (lost in the mail!)
Was refunded Jan 2015

Note: We played some rules wrong which had a significant effect on the game by causing more blockages in key areas than there should have been, though the game does rely on choke points to force players to interact.

Redacted is a light hidden teams, deduction game of trying to locate some intelligence documents and escape via helicopter (or destroy the opponents helicopters). The game play itself is quite light but there is a surprisingly large front loading of the rules required to play. I think that some of the complexity inherent in the systems should have been simplified. Specifically the Neutral/Friendly cards seem like a distinction without a purpose, when the mainframe computer activates is thematic but not obvious, tokens to hide inactive rooms (might be in the retail version) and most of all the reducing RPS probability tree which when combined with the lack of directions that people can move after interactions is frustrating at best. There are ways to mitigate the latter but they never felt like enough. It just seemed to make the game bog down into back and forth fights for access to items.
I'm reminded in many ways of The Castle of the Devil, but better.

A really cool game with lots of different game mechanics nicely blended together.  The rules change depending on the number of players.

Despite having played it almost a hundred times during development, I still love playing it. Thank you Mityu for letting me be a designer on this game!

EDIT: If I could rate it, I would rate it a high 8, or a low 9, as I'm almost always happy to play it, still, 50 games later.

Superb game at trying to simulate a set of incompetent spy's blundering around an embassy trying to get the secret, find allies and escape.  More Peter Sellers as Clouseau then as James Bond.  

That said i thought my wife would hate, but as it made us all laugh each turn she even wants to play again - so possibly not a winner by the design they were aiming at, but as its all about fun then a top class game :)

2,3,4 & 5 players.

Play the role of a spy and complete missions on the board, you have to find your backup, get the intelligence, and board your helicopter before the enemy blows it up. Unless that was just a double blind bluff?
Uses unique scissors paper rock combat so even a casual encounter can have heavy bluffing. Really this is just nonstop bluffing.

Iszonyatosan jó tematika, rossz mechanika. Nagyon fájó pont a gyenge harcrendszer, és a rossz ponton elhelyezett szerencsefaktor. Pedig nagyon jó játék lehetne.

While I'm a big fan of spy fiction in general, I found that this game could have been better. The vibe and setting of this game is spot on, but sadly is mostly reduced to a mess of what boils down to rock/paper/scissors. We've introduced a series of house rules that return little bit more of the espionage feel to the game, but there's still a lot of fighting. The interaction mechanic could have been greatly improved to remove the heavily-action oriented feel to the game. It feels a little bit more like a street gang fight than a bunch of spies at a cocktail party at times. While the five player variant introduces the Interpol agent as a wild card, we find that he's never punished enough for making incorrect choices.

This is an odd one. Everybody who has played it said that they liked it but every time it is proposed some other game gets past it. Plenty of great mechanisms in this game.

Interactive spy game during a reception in the embassy to make off with top secret files. The mind screwage of the double blind method for exchanging intel cannot be over emphasized. It may involve some extra shuffling but is so very effective. The use of private rock-scissors-paper to resolve conflict adds to the suspense and calculated uncertainty. Got to have item cards of course to throw in a random variable to account for.  Another clever dynamic is not knowing which agents are on your side! I cannot remember a game that power packs so much into the bluff, deduction, counter-bluff and betrayed negotiation. If this game doesn't get you talking to yourself, you are not playing it right.

Since I am a hugh fan of social deduction games, I wanted to love this game. However, there is something missing. Not enough rooms were active, and the interactivity I was hoping was lacking. There is an expansion I will have to try out, but for now, the game feels incomplete.

Game works well with some minor rule tweaks regarding card exchanges. First half of game is much more tense as players tenatively move around attempting to gain information on the other players while attempting to minimize risk to themselves. Once teams are clearly established, the game approaches an almost deterministic end unless tabletalk is culled through house rules.

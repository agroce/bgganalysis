RATING: 6
Surprisingly nice pick-up-and-deliver/race game.  Great graphic design on the wombats...not great on the terrains.  I really like the foot/digestion/poop mechanic.  It's all a bit of a stretch, but I enjoyed my turns...until the board got choked with poop.  Not sure that worked out well.

Minus 1-2 points due to poor 5th-player expansion.  It slows the game to a crawl and makes it probably twice as long.  And really boring downtime.

Incredibly creative, charming, and funny game, with tough decisions and lots of fun nail-bitey moments. Wonderful components, too. 

Congratulations, Matt!

Really interesting network-building game with excellent components and a cute theme. Your goal is to get to the other end of the board and rescue your babies, but you can't move freely; you can either move along unimpeded lines within your territory (marked by poop cubes) or wander in the wilderness (either by smelling nearby food, or by random chance.) 

Relatively little luckiness is forced on the player, but choosing to go off the beaten path and take a risk can be very rewarding. The game requires a bit of planning ahead, as it takes a few turns after eating before you can "expand your territory"

A decent idea but unfortunately it suffers from a massive runaway leader problem (once you have your route established first its pretty much over) and just fiddly game play (trying to figure out where you do and do not have scent trails can be awkward).

The mechanics of the game are okay. If it was picking up spices along trade routes it would not get a second play. But it's not!

The game shines on theme alone. When else do you ever get to say "I'm going to use my turbo turd this turn" or "I'm going to prairie dog this one for one more turn"?

For this reason, the game will likely stay in the collection for a while. I'm curious to play with the more advanced options, but at the same time, the game got a little long with the basic rules. The dingo was very much back and forth the entire game until I got smart and put him somewhere where he didn't matter. Need to think of a better mechanic for that I think. 

Overall fun to play with someone for the first time, probably won't see much replay with the same people.

Got this on Kickstarter.  The art sucked me in.

The good:  The quality of the game is high.  The idea of a wombat game is totally fun. 

The bad:  I watched the walkthrough video and couldn't bring myself to invest more time.  It just doesn't look fun.  I can't totally put my finger on it, but it just seems boring.   Maybe it's just a slower-paced game.  Maybe it's the lack of suspense.  This one is just not for me.

Update:  Donated it to my kids' school.

Very nice package with high-quality components. The little wombat meeples are cute. My only issue, really, is that the game is just too light for us. I believe it would work great with younger kids and families, but doesn’t offer enough to keep us interested, unfortunately. I don’t want to be too harsh because it really is a great kids game.

2016-01-27 - This is a pretty fun take on route building and pick-up and deliver. The theme is adorable and the game itself is both simple and deeper than expected.

2017-01-18 - The theme is still fun, but the game itself seems to telegraph the ending a bit too much. I'm keeping it, because it is still fun and will work great as a gateway, but I'm not likely to play it outside of that scenario.

RATING: 4
Combining race with engine building is a terrible idea. Both of these types of games have run away leader issues. This is a textbook example of bad design. The game is over well before it's over. Even if there is a competition for first, there will be someone at the table who knows they've lost well before the game is over.

This game really fluctuates on the layout. The starting layout in the book is fairly lackluster unless played with obstacles. I've devised a pretty large scale sprawling map that I think makes the game good on it's own, but challenging with boulders and extra dingos. It's definitely better with more players.

A light "race" game where you are trying to get your baby wombats back home.  The game has a good art and a puzzle element as well as fun jokes on poop.  

Overall the game is very family-weight and not a "gamers" game.  Therefore I was not keen on it, however, I could see this being fun for families with younger 7-12 year old kids.

This was actually a really great game with a good amount of humor for both the old and young at heart

You have to carefully plan your route to food and then think about where you want to expand your smell area, while at the same time trying to block off other wombats

Very lighthearted, easy to learn game, yet has enough depth to keep you motivated. Also, design and production quality are exceptional, justifying the steep price of 50 EUR at SPIEL '15. I expect this to become a staple at our playing table, and not just for the unavoidable onslaught of poop-puns :-)

Just one tiny bit of criticism: The endlessly cute wombat and dingo meeples are a bit off-balanced and keep falling on their heads, which is a bit annoying - if there should be a second edition, that should be fixed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game stood out in 2015 for truly offering something new. Fun theme (oh, all the horrible poop puns!), innovative, easy yet deep and very thematic gameplay mechanics, stellar art and outstanding quality make this my personal favorite of 2015.

Minor complaints that should be adressed for a second print:

- Rules could be a bit clearer on some points (see forum here at BGG)
- Dingo figures have a strong tendency to fall on their heads because of bad weight distribution (mama wombats too, to some wxtent) - design should be slightly improved there
- Boulders should be part of the basic retail version - the game is kind of boring without obstacles
- A few hints for creating a well balanced custom tile layout could help avoid too easy or too hard sessions (I have experienced both)

RATING: 7
An actual reason that playing piece are cube-shaped -- and it's legit.  And it gives you a reason to say poop repeatedly during a game.  I think maybe better at higher player counts, my wife and I still had a good time placing little cube poop trails for our wombats to follow. Can end up a little "mean" depending on dingo moves, but I think that's a pretty minor quibble.

Cute, entertaining puzzle-like game of charging wombats. 

Rulebook needs work though. It didn't tell us which spaces were the food ones, and didn't mention that the boulder spaces were for some kickstarter only components and so we had too much food in our first play. It's probably a completely different game with less food.

I love this game. It is a simple pick-up-and-deliver / route building game, but the way it is matched with the theme is fantastic. I especially like the 'when you can's smell anything, you're lost and you wondar in a random direction'. We al felt like an almost blind wombat stumbling round. It seems like a simple children's game (and it might be that also) but with serious players using there tiles right this is a must play for anyone. After a few plays you get the hang of it, and I cannot imagine that I will play it more then 10 times (hence the 7). Otherwise: nothing but praise from me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After reading the rules, I thought this game would be a 2, so I'm impressed.  The game works smoothly and intuitively, and it is well balanced.  It's mostly obvious moves + a little luck, but I still found the mechanics to be pleasing to execute, if not engaging to plan around.

A tad too complex for a family game but a tad to simplistic for a serious filler, so I feel that it doesn't hit the mark, even though I appreciate many elements of the game.

tl;dr: a bit too long

A game about spreading your poop cubes for more efficient movement? What the hell? This game is just one huge open doors for lots of puns during play, so that can be fun. And the game itself is certainly not unenjoyable. You have strategically spread your poop so you can move around efficiently to get your babies home before the other players complete their four runs.
The game did outstay it's welcome a bit. The way the game is set up is that 2 babies are at equal distance from the home base, 1 is a bit further, 1 is a good amount further. Getting to that last one is pretty difficult. I think the game would be served well by removing the 3rd baby so you can go directly from the first easy ones to the difficult one. That should shave off some play time and do away with the let-me-do-the-same-thing-again that starts happening as the game goes on.
I haven't tested this though, but I think it could be a good improvement.

Initial rating: 6.5/10
BGG scale: 6/10

The first part of the game, where you build your poop network, is the interesting bit. Once the network is established it becomes a bit bland. But then again, that is close to the game's end so it's no big deal.

Modular board and different rules to change difficulty and playing time is a big plus.

This is such a fun little game. Love the theme. Going to be a great game for family and the "gamers" out there. It has a very unique, at least to me, game mechanic that requires you to spatially visualize your Wombat mother's movements. Took a little while to get head around, but once you get it it's really cool.

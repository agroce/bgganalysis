Sin haber jugado, al abrir la caja, mala impresión: muy buenos componentes pero un precio desorbitado por un mazo de cartas, cubitos, un tablero y kilos y kilos de aire. Lo de 'planes' debe ser precisamente por eso. Muy desproporcionado 29-X-2014

Ya jugado varias veces, es divertido, una especie de actualización del mancala africano

A basic mancala game with the addition of cards that grant special actions and scoring opportunities. Too random and chaotic to be a gamer's game. Might seem fine as a family or child's game except that constantly having to consult the rulebook to explain the large variety of symbols on the cards might be much for them.

The second in AEG's "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" trilogy, Planes is really a straight up abstract game. It's a mancala pure and simple. Yes, you do play cards to score and use special abilities but in the end you are just moving cubes through a mancala trying to score points. A good game but if you are looking for theme you won't find it here. However, if you are looking for a unique mancala game you will find that here.

Solid, interesting mancala game with nice variation through the different Goal cards and setup possibilities. I feel like this was a little underrated when it came out, not as good as Trains but still pretty fun. Probably overshadowed by that other recent mancala style Euro, Five Tribes.

2014, 2-4p, 30-45 min.  AVOID (see below), abstract (mancala), hand mgt, pt-to-pt mvmt, pattern bldg

Others say:  mancala with action cards (plus the ability to drop more than one pebble in a pit), player aids and icons are not good (hard to follow for first game), best for 2p, VERY tactical (non-strategic), and you CANNOT plan ahead (esp. w/4p) because the only thing that matters is what people left you with for the start of your turn, LOTS of potential for AP which makes it even more boring and frustrating.  Overall, just a "meh" game.

* There's a slightly more balanced variant where each person gets his own identical deck of action cards... from which he draws his cards randomly, but at least it doesn't allow a single player to get multiple copies of the best action cards and/or get and easily score duplicate cards.

This game continues to grow on me, and IMO is greatly underrated. Yes, it's just mancala with special powers, but there are so many things to consider, between timing your own moves, planning future ones, trying not to set your opponents up, and choosing how to use your cards. I vastly prefer the "infinity side" of the board. 

Fun, fast filler that can easily be played two or three times in a single session.

I'm trying to like Planes and not really sure what it is about this game that's off. I don't hate it, and actually like the strategy, but my husband really dislikes it so its hard to enjoy the game. The blockage rules were somewhat vague so we struggled with the mechanics during our 1st run through. Once we figured out what we were doing wrong, we played a couple more games that went slightly better. We have only played the 2 player version, so I'm hoping the game plays a little bit better with 4 players. If not, I doubt it will have a place on our shelf much longer.

Pros: Mancala with small twists in cardplay and movement. Cards drawn can be used as a special ability or score for minor points.

I'd rather play Five Tribes.

Also admittedly, I don't get Mancala which is the heart of Planes. Sorry David.

Good, solid filler 6 (vs a 6 that, eh, not as good as expected).  Purchased knowing it was mancala with a few twists, but it was fun enough even with two --- especially given the price.

One thing -- and it's perhaps unexpected on such a relatively straightforward game -- but the instructions and aids are just excellent.  They are well designed, clear and easy to read, and supplemented with a summary overview and some example play.

Great utilization of the mancala mechanic. The cards are a great way to either get an advantage with block movement or points at the end of the turn which can make for interesting choices.

Played Oct 2014

The mancala movement is fun but the game is pretty chaotic. Goal cards can land in your lap and if not you need at most a 1 turn plan to satisfy them, the board changes far too much each round to plan further. The game is therefore highly tactical and the decisions you have each turn are not wrought with much tension. The most interesting choice is how you'll play your cards. Use the action to set up a scoring option or use the goal to score some points, do which ever yields more points. Another perfectly fine light game which I have no use for.

--------------------------------------------------------

Read rules Sept 30

Perhaps better called Terminal, Planes is a light-medium game of pattern building and scoring. The central mechanic is the quite trendy mancala movement system. Trajan, Five Tribes, and now Planes. Each player has several cubes of their colour in a simplified top-down sketch of an airport. The mancala bowls are the spaces which are linked by arrows showing which way you must move the cubes. When moving you must choose a space that has at least one of your cubes and you move all cubes of all colours, dropping one off in each space you visit. 

The goal is to score points by landing a cube of your colour on a gate space where your plane is. The cube boards the plane earning you 5VP. On a turn you can also play an action to help you break the rules of movement, gather all your cubes to certain spaces, draw cards, or even take two turns in a row. You can also play a card to score points if the board has a certain configuration of cubes showing, e.g. certain cubes of certain colours in certain spaces. Each card has both an action and a goal and you can only use it for one purpose.

It seems like a short, light game. I want to play simply because of the mancala mechanic. I really adore it in the other games mentioned, and David Short did design Ground Floor which is an absolute masterpiece. However, I don't expect to like Planes too much. It seems players will be stepping all over each others plans. The shared mancala is going to be quite chaotic. This is likely a game where you can't plan your next turn until it is your turn because the board is too dynamic.

Sasquatch 2014 "Neutral". Happy to play it again and I would probably pick it up if I found it for really cheap. I would like to try it with 2 players to see how it feels when you have more control. Seems like a good family game in which you can help children practice not setting up the next player.

RATING: 7
This game is easy to setup, has easy rules to learn/teach at roughly 15 min to do so. The goal is to get your five matching colored cubes (passengers) to your plane first.  The game plays like mancala in the sense that for each location on the track that has at least one of your cubes you will pickup the whole lot of people and start moving one space at a time leaving one person in each space. The goal is to land on your plane with one cube in your hand (preferably your color). Do that five more times and you've ended the game (and likely won). Gameplay is 30-45 min, fun little theme, nice price. Perfect family game and isn't bad on the casual gaming table either. Will likely play this if given a list of casual games.

Very enjoyable mancala like abstract game.  Minimal luck, mostly an abstract game with a nice pasted on theme (the busy airport where there are occasional bottlenecks caused by traffic).  Easy to learn, quick to play, interactive.  There is an element of interactive chaos that I enjoy, and the playing field and playing time is small enough that you are bound to interact often with other players.  Nice attention to the little details in the production, like the player aids made to look like perforated boarding passes.  Having to choose between this and Finca (another Mancala type game) I would prefer Finca, but the games are different enough to stand on their own merits.

This is a decent game that's worth playing. It's not too complex and can be picked up pretty quickly if you read the rules once and then try playing after. It can get cutthroat if played well so play with someone you likely feuding with. It is played quickly once you get the hang of it. The piece construction is of lower quality but it doesn't really detract from the game itself. I'd play it again if I saw the game and felt like playing and I'm glad I have it in my collection.

RATING: 7.5
As many have mentioned, this throws a new face on mancala.  It's being frequently compared to Istanbul, Five Tribes, and Trajan since they center on a mancala-style mechanism.  Since those are all very well-received games, I think it stands to argue that this mechanism meshes really well with euro-style games and I'm sure we'll continue to see more of them in the coming years.  As far as Planes, I love how light it feels while still giving me very clever and interesting options each turn.  Turns move quickly so downtime is low, and I remain interested in other players' turns since I'm hoping they either set something up for me or at least don't inadvertently mess up my plans.  The dual use action/goal cards also offer a great decision - choosing to use them for one or the other adds flexibility and makes for cool combo opportunities, as well as provides some varying point strategies.  Gameplay remains fairly abstract but the theme is surprisingly well integrated with the art and components.  Overall, this fits a really nice niche of lightweight play that anyone can jump in on, coupled with a familiar mechanism that mancala players will understand and enjoy, as well as sufficient strategic decisions to keep "gamers" engaged and coming back.

It is two way mancala with additional objectives that can be used alternatively as help cards. The components are OK and the graphic design is made to match Trains. The theme is funny the first time your read it, but it's nowhere to be found.

The objectives seem balanced, but some of the cards are really powerful, they grant you will score one passenger on almost any circumstances.

The goals and specially the help cards and the many players make it a random game, and this is my main complaint. I willing to forgive that because of its short duration, but it's not one game I would want to play often.

I have not played a 2-player game, but it will probably be deprived of much of its randomness.

A tactical point builder. Cards have 2 uses. Movement is via a modified Mancala mechanism. Score points by using cards for goal points, or by boarding your plane. Keep this game light, and it'll be good fast fun. Bring in AP, and the game will take drag. Easy to teach.

Planes should've been nominated for the Spiel des Jahres.!! Way to go David Short and AEG for another excellent game! Fresh theme!

Reminds me of Mancala with the Mission-Cards-wildness from Nexus Ops, and a dash of Parcheesi/Sorry thrown in. Tight design with character. This is definitely not vanilla Mancala, nor is it a Feld-ian or Gerdts-ian Mancala.

Only played the base game (as suggested in the rules), but that was quite dull to play. Maybe the reverse side will be more challenging.

What I don't understand is: if you're cards are by definition not language independent, why not use full text that is clear for everybody then half text, half icons that aren't clear by themselves???

Update after second play: the reverse side and the expert rules provide a better game, but it stays a very chaotic game, where you can't start analysing things before it is you turn.

 Of all the mass market abstract games (chess, checkers, backgammon) mancala is my least liked. I never cared for that game, and this feels like a gamer version of that. I suppose for some that might sound like a good concept, but it is not a good fit for me. I found this game dry, boring, and uninspiring. At two players I question how well it will hold up to repeated plays. After just a few plays we were making the same first moves over and over again, because they seemed to be the most efficient way to score quickly. This game is not one that I enjoyed it all.

The classic game of mancala is essentially reimplemented here in this game.  The mechanics are almost completed the same with a few twists in that colors matter and there are cards.  The nice thing about this game is that it is easy to learn and fast to play.  There is ample room for strategic thinking on your turn but there's almost no point in planning ahead since someone will inevitably alter the best laid plans.

From Spirit Games

Another cube pusher. this one in the sty;e of Mancala

It's not bad, just nothing outstanding. The variable starting layouts and 2 types of board should give this one enough legs to keep hold of for a while.

An absolute waste of time. Because, after all, what's more entertaining than crowding up airport gates?

Yes, it could have been fun. Yes, it's an interesting concept. No, it doesn't work. Not for us, anyway.

As a sad collector of airmiles and obsessive about everything air travel related this is an insta buy.

My god its boring.

RATING: 6.5
There's a good game in here but I'm being a little stingy with my rating because the iconography and player's aid did not aid the player to the extent they ought to have.  Quite good design work has been done to create a mancala game with extra-power cards, some ways to score, and an interesting deadline to end the game.  But it tends to run slow while players think out their moves and then play them out on the board, a process prone to error, and the confusing icons tested our patience further.  Possibly with repeated play we'd get used to the icons and would know the basic tricks and it would all go by at a pleasant speed.  Will we ever play it that many times?  I don't know.

Planes is definitively a much better "mancala" than the overrated Five Tribes.

Fun abstract game with an airport theme where players move passengers around the concourse in an attempt to board planes.

tl;dr: not enough depth

OK, I know not every game should be deep and involving and stuff. I don't mind a lighter game at all. But some of those lighter games don't have enough depth for what they are trying to be. And I feel like this is one of those games. We played with the advanced board, with the figure eight. I haven't played the oval one, but the player who did told me that side is even more boring. It's just not very exciting. Pick up some cubes and drop them off. The biggest problem is that there is no way you can set yourself up to do a good move on the next turn, other players will see through that and prevent it. So the best thing you can do is hope they give you a good move by mistake and stop them from getting one from you. Meh. I prefer games in which my success is more based on my skills and what I built for myself.

Initial rating: 6/10
BGG scale: 5/10

Very nice mancala game, but the scoring on the cards is not well designed.

RATING: 7
Cool looking light game with loosely inspired theme which works and makes funny conversation about what's happening at the airports. The overlaid mechanic is from mancala, and there are cards for actions and optional victory points. My experience is 2p only with each our own deck of cards, and it's not extremely chaotic. In fact, you can plan two turns ahead (the next turn you can be sure, almost sure to do what you want, the next maybe?). I like it for what it is: a filler for half an hour. There are two boards and the 8-shaped airport is small and easy to make mistakes on. Tension! 
I'd like to try with 3 or even 4 players, but I think 2p is just fine.
UPDATE: it's a blast with 4! Less control than in a 2p game, but there are plenty of tactical, even strategical decisions to make. Keeper.
And three is fine, but not all that fair because it makes a huge difference whether you have the only active plane on a side, or share the side with another player. 

PS: got this game from the nice people at the AEG booth when I picked up my Trains-order (Spiel'16). Kudos to them!

Good idea for a theme, and good idea for a mechanic, but something along the line didn't gel.  The theme of getting your party on board an airplane should make the game feel frenetic, but instead it has a tendency to bog down as players overthink their moves.  Likewise, the mancala mechanic with different playing pieces per player is a strong one, but the game is far too chaotic to plan ahead.  This should have gone with being a pure abstract or with being a real-time free for all, but this middle-of-the-road approach pleases nobody.

Not at all like Trains. Fun little game though. Same moving mechanic/mancala mechanism as Five Tribes but lighter and faster.

A solid 7 Euro with a mancala mechanic.  Variable tile placement extends the replay value of the game.  Light entry level gaming.

Mancala on a one way circular airport terminal.  Move a group of cubes containing at least one of your family cubes around the terminal to fill set condition goal cards in a race to board the plane.

A mancala-style game that has different mechanics you can pull in and out. It plays fast enough that you don't tire of the gameplay.

**UPDATE** Played two players and I really enjoy it! Raised rating from 6.5 to 7.7.

Played with 4 players, could not plan much as players can easily disrupt what was planned. That was pretty much a deal breaker for me on this one. Fan factor was low and the guy explaining the game to us didn't help the experience.

A cross between Trajan's mancala with ludo and bonus action cards; no planes  -- they should have just made it a web or mobile game.  Other than the mancala its a waste of time. Box is too big. £30 for this?

GAME: Exceed: Red Horizon â€“ Gabrek & Ulrik vs. Alice & Zoey
RANK: 4176
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun and fast paced 2D fighting game. 4 fighters each play a little different.  Uses similar mechanics to BattleCON, but has a faster set-up and play time. Compared to BattleCON this game is much more about hand management and hand advantage than strategy and opponent reading.

Go Ulrik!

Exceed is fun enough that it pains me not to have tried all these characters against each other, let alone gotten the other boxes. But I have way more BattleCON characters than I ever got to play so I'm holding back.

Anyway, that also means I have no sense of the balance here because I'm pretty bad. Alice seems like a weaker character, but maybe just harder to use?

Promising, but I'll need more plays before I can try to evaluate fairly beyond my BattleCON prejudices (i.e., I vastly prefer BattleCON).

Fun so far, though not yet sure about the balance in all of the matchups.

Pretty fun dueling card game. There are better games on the market though. (*cough* BattleCon).

The series has received some flak online for the art style. I can see why some stuff, like how some female characters are portrayed, might be annoying to people. Normally I wouldn't really care (it's very westernized anime-like and I do tend to like that artstyle so eh) but it's rather appaling hen compared to Battlecon. A series where all characters are portrayed very well (except Clive. He's kinda lame and lifeless).

I don't know how to improve the game. Perhaps... allow you to discard a card for +1 Gauge and allow you to spend said Gauge for Priority? Range isn't an issue since you can spend Gauge/Force to move.
That might help. Or more cards with Guard?
Dunno. Right now stunning just seems really strong.

[PNP] The game was super close and intense but we are not sure if we like this more than Battlecon. Need to play more.

I didn't expect much from this, being that it is from Level 99 Games and Jasco, two companies that have been very spotty for me in terms of quality. Excuse the pun, but Exceed really exceeded my expectations. I've played a lot of these board/card game conversions of fighting games, but I think Exceed is easily my favorite. It doesn't do anything that new or noteworthy, but it combines a lot of the best aspects of games like Yomi, Battlecon, and Flash Duel into a system that works really well. I'm a little annoyed that you have to track down all the individual sets, and having foil cards mixed in with regular cards promotes unintentional cheating while shuffling, but otherwise I think that this is the best fighting system Level 99 has come out with yet. It really feels like Magic: The Gathering if it was a fighting game. I hope this continues to get support, as well, as this really makes Battlecon obsolete for me. Puzzle Strike is pretty close to the same quality as this, but this game avoids the pitfall of the luck of the draw far more, in my opinion.

I came away quite impressed with Exceed. In the realm of two-player dueling games, this is one of the best. I would have appreciated some more restrained artwork, especially with the female characters. Still, it recreates the rhythm of fighting video games with surprisingly light rules.

See Season 1 for more comments.
This box contains some of my favorite characters. Gabrek may be just a little weak but played intelligently, can beat anyone, thanks to an excellent Exceed mode that makes his wrestling style vicious. Ulrik is a favorite of mine, using a combination of speed and long-range movement, that often end up with melee attacks (a great matchup with Gabrek, since he ultimately often ends up in his wrestling range). Alice is OP and was, I believe, banned in tournaments. Yet, she's a good character to give to a new new player, while the veteran plays with Eva. I have yet to try Zoey.

The Exceed system is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Fast, hard-hitting, and brutally immediate. In a lot of ways, I like this even more than the BattleCON system. Though I wish some of the art weren't so, um, tasteless.

Note that my rating is for the system as a whole. I've mixed the characters from different sets and so far none of the characters stand out as exceptionally bad or good, so they all get the same rating.

BattleCon is dead, all hail the new BattleCon!

Seriously, I loved the idea of BattleCon but hated the game itself. My biggest issues were the lack of any randomness, massive AP, and the complicated timing structure of each round. Exceed fixes it all and makes even more improvements.

First is the much-needed randomness. Now instead of having a huge hand of cards that has to be analyzed by both you and your opponent (your hand of cards in BattleCon is essentially open-information), in Exceed you just draw cards from your deck and work with what you have. It's much more tactical and much more satisfying. In Exceed each card now has two different uses so hand management and setting up combos is more important.

The timing structure is much, much better and flows so much smoother in Exceed. When it's your turn to attack you just look for any Before effects, any Hit effects, then any After effects. Then your opponent does the same. No more "beats," no more ante tokens, no more needless complications of BattleCon.

The "timer" has also been improved. In BattleCon you had to remember to advance a timer each round, and if time ran out you would then determine a winner. It was almost impossible to ever remember to advance the timer. In Exceed, if a player's deck runs out for a second time they lose. Very simple, and there's nothing to track.

BattleCon also eventually added rules about using a hit gauge for various effects and different ways to perform your special attack. Exceed simplifies all of that: when you land a hit, you put the card into your "gauge" area. You can eventually spend your gauge to perform your special attacks. It's that simple.

It feels like Exceed is what they originally wanted in this system but they just didn't know how to make it work, so we had to suffer through BattleCon until the system could be refined. I'm glad they finally got through the rough draft, because now we have a really good game. Can't wait to try the other Exceed fighters.

RATING: 10
Smell the cordite!  More so than in any other naval game. It's my favourite wargame and plays a lot like simplified miniatures.  I've played it a lot and own most of the variants (Mediterranean, Baltic, axed ships, South Atlantic) and the later edition.  One minor problem, which I enjoyed solving, is that Avalon Hill slanted it rather too heavily towards the Germans.  Okay, so their ships were usually much better, but not SO much as AH made them.  I get around that easily enough.  I've designed slightly amended hit sheets and they work a little better.  The game plays well stategically and tactically and the rules are just right without making it too heavy.  You can use 1/3000th sale miniatures instead of the pieces should you so wish, and the affect is quite splendid.  The other thing about playing the game using the main battle (Jutland itself) is that you are in a position to win or lose WW1 in an afternoon.  This was the only battle in the war were that was actually the case.  Although the real battle was indecisive, it could perhaps have been one of the great decisive battles of the 20th Century.  Now's your chance to make it just that!  Brilliant!  

Good Points
Revolutionary. You gotta admire the history of this one. It?s one of a handful of wargames that broke the mould - hitboxes and no board, for instance.
In terms of fun in the midst of battle this one is still king. A naval battle plays with all the dynamism of a real one. You feel in control and yet not in control.
It's edgy and ships may blow up on you. You can make a brilliant move or a stupid one.
You get the feel of the different types of ships doing what they really did.
The critical hits in the second edition and in the AH General are very well done.
With the given rules, plus the expansions that came later, you get lots of battles you can recreate and a good number of exciting what-ifs.
If you have the miniatures (as I do) you can add them and keep the rules.
There's something about naval battles when you blow up someone else's ship (better if it's their flagship) that is rather like the tossing in the volcano moment in Pompeji - you just don't get that in most land based battles. It's an adrenaline shot.
You can play this quick or slow. A Battlecruiser skirmish can be done in less than an hour.
Unlike many naval games, the book-keeping is barely more than in, say, O Zoo Le Mio.
It's cheap on Ebay.

This is the 1967 print of the game. It's a bit shelf-worn, as you might expect of a game of this age. One "battle maneuver gauge" has a crease; otherwise, the parts are in about as perfect shape as they could be for having sat around all these years.

I bought this shortly after it came out, but had no room to play it.  Then I was moving into a new apartment with no furniture in a large newly carpeted living room.  I called an old buddy and we went at this for several days, sleeping on the floor and eating out.  We were both utterly amazed at the insights.  I'd read a lot of naval military accounts with maps and diagrams, but never really "got it" until this experience.  Most suspenseful was during a tactical engagement that took up the whole floor; both players were obviously rushing everything they had from nearby strategic hexes, but you never knew what the other guy had coming, or when, and which "hexside" it would enter.  Sometimes we really hammered each other but rarely sank a ship.  Haven't played it since but the experience has lasted a lifetime.

This is a great naval battle game. The strategic level is an adult version of "Battleship" in terms of searching for each other's fleets. Tactical battle level is a blast, with easy rules to handle movement and shooting, special damage, torpedo attacks, and so forth. Book keeping is minimal. Truly a fun game.

When published, this was basically a naval miniatures game published in a box.  If you were a naval miniaturist, the game had nothing to offer regarding the tactical treatments; only the operational level plotting of fleet movements that set the stage for the tactical battles was useful.  But if you were a boardgamer, this game usually was the best introduction to naval miniatures.  It was a controversial game at the time and has been superseded by a number of efforts, most notably Avalanche Press's GREAT WAR AT SEA series for the operational level experience, if not the tactical one.  Other than for nostalgia, there's little reason to play it today.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game.  But remember to keep enough ships in each search group in case you bump into opposing search groups that have alot more ships in them.  This happened once (I was the British and my opponent was the Germans) and I got creamed.

Excellent introduction to wargaming. Jutland gives a newbie a good introduction to naval wargaming without the complexity of 'total realism' rules such as Seekrieg or Harpoon. If you just want to have a go at it you play the basic rules on the kitchen table. The advanced rules are by comparison to the above mentioned games on an intermediate level and gives an excellent balance between realism and playability. Being set in the WW1 era you're not encumbered by air rules, submarine warfare or sensors management such as radar or sonar. Your only concern is the grand tactics of your panzershiffe! The counters supplied with the game can be substituted for miniatures to get the most of the gaming experience. In all a very well balanced game and a natural starting point if you want to try naval wargaming.

I read and reread a brochure from Avalon Hill about this game so many times I could recitie it word for word. Finally cut enough grass to order it and waited six weeks only to receive a letter instead telling me it was out of print. WOW, that hurt. Ten years later I picked up a copy of the new version. Played it on our carport I don't know how many times. Nice system.

A fun and playable simulation of the monster naval battle between the Royal Navy and the High Seas Fleet. I just lack the space and interest to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Is it still a board game without a board?

*Finally* able to get a game of this on the table and as I expected from my reading of the rules over the years the search phase is (IMO) rubbish (and the basic game search phase is completely broken).  I guess it will work, and for one of the very first war games ever, published in 1967 it can be forgiven I guess...

The 'tactical game' on the otherhand (IMO) is quite nice.  It is quite "light" and will not appeal to the true naval grognard (which I am not), but seems like this system would be *perfect* for a convention or as an intro (naval) war game and plays quite fast even with large lines of ships banging away at each other.

I would have no qualms about tossing this out at a convention and *teaching* a half dozen players in one sitting.  That is not something that can be said for any of the other more "realistic" naval games on the market today.  

I would rate this much higher if the search rules were not so lame and yet so critical to the entire camapaign.  This game rates as an easy 8-9 with a referee as a great simple, introductary naval war game.

Note: copy missing 1 German ship

Another game I have not played was part of group of games I came across. Though this one is more appealing to me be it all the different naval ships and the Iconic battle you are recreating.

Just difficult with little kids running around to leave out beyond a day.

The game that inspired a beloved hobby over the course of my lifetime. After Gettysburg by AH, this was my second game ever. How many other 10 year olds are fascinated by a sea battle that occurred over 50 years before? As a result, I have collected over 300 Navis & Neptun 1:1250 model ships.  Still remember getting chased out of the living room after my Mom got tired of cardboard all over the rug! In Sep 2011 decided I needed to have it on my shelf again. $9.99 on eBay!

I think I played a full game of this in the advanced version twice back in the 60s/70s. (Also played a basic version, but that was not very satisfying.)

An interesting and enjoyable game but it requires a lot of space and a lot of time for the full Jutland scenario. Further, the German player just doesn't have a lot of chance.

There were several situations in the earlier part of the war when the Germans DID have a better chance, both real and fictitious. I've detailed these as scenarios and posted them in the BGG Jutland files section.

Have played this 3 times relatively recently and we seem to be in a rut.  What happens each time is the game goes on for 8-10 hours, the Germans make significant progress approaching the 1:1 Capital Ship victory condition but don't quite make it, and the Germans are so bloodied and the British have so many fresh ships left that it's doubtful if we continued to the end that the Germans would reach 1:1.  On the positive side of the ledger it is a hoot moving little rectangular ships around on a big table and blasting away at each other.

"Open table top" 2-player wargame played with range finders and manuever gauges rather than hexes.  The combat is a bit awkward, with an "I move, you move, I  fire, you fire" mechanic that gives an advantage to the last player to move (British).  The game also has a very restrictive time window - the designer's attempt to replicate historical factors, but it limits what players can do.  What are those 2 Northern British fleets for, anyways?  Played once using advanced rules.

RATING: 5
Let's get the first part out of the way now. I would never play this game again because I have zero desire in crawling around on the floor to play a game. Fortunately, that is really the only bad thing I can say about this game. It is a minis game using cardboard instead of lead but it is actually more than that since there is a search component to this game where you have to find the enemy ships before you can engage and have combat.

For me, that is the best part of the whole game. There is a tension to this game because you don't know when or where the battle will actually occur. The only other naval game where I have seen this occur is with Battleline's Flat Top. Once the battle is engaged, the shells start flying and like a good movie, it reaches its satisfying climax. 

I have so many great memories of this one but I'm too old to enjoy it now.

Good naval wargame.  Cross between miniatures and counter-based gaming.  Surely a ground-breaking game for its time, its age now exposes it weaknesses (i.e. poor gunnery damage model).  Regardless, a treat to play, especially as an early wargame to introduce new players (just be careful of the two-year old running amok across the North Sea!).

--Dec2003-- Loved this back in the '70s.  (This was my first Avalon Hill game, bought in '71 or '72; I got AH's Kriegspiel the next year.  Somewhat naturally - given the relative weakness of K - I played a lot of Jutland with family and neighbours in those days. Despite the happy memories, it hasn't aged well for me; I don't want to play it again.)

WW I naval war game for the battle of Jutland.  A very simple game, with advanced rules.  1st war game owned.

I picked up an extra copy of Jutland at a garage sale and gave it to a friend several years ago. Actually I can't remember if I gave him the garage sale copy or the copy of the game I had purchased previously and never played. I eventually punched the counters and tried it solitaire, but it was an early game. I think my biggest critique was that the critical hit table didn't have enough blood and gore in it.

Miniatures without the miniatures.  Only played the full campaign once, but played a lot of smaller scenarios on our 4 foot round table.
A teenaged me started making a Civil War ironclad version based on this and WS&IM that never got finished.

Groundbreaking design, WWI operational/tactical naval game. Closer to a miniatures game than a board game (and very nearly started me down that treacherously expensive path). One of my all time favorites, initially dethroned by SPI's 'Dreadnought', and more firmly displaced by the Avalanche naval games. Separate operational double blind movement and search phase, only throwing the ship counters on the table (or more likely the floor) when the fleets find each other. Simple tactical movement and combat mechanics, using cardboard movement and ranging aids instead of distance tables and tape measures, and pre-printed log sheets to track damage (instead of cluttering the battle with additional markers).

This should be more scalar games like this. We don't need no stinking grid... But this works well for ships if you use a blue tablecloth or such covering!

This may have been the first MONSTER game. I remember filling an entire living room floor with ship counters trying to maintain formation, LOL.

When we were young, single and had lots of free time, we tried this a few times with a referee for hidden movement.  Had the ship counters on the floor but we never seemed to be able to complete a game.  It was certainly a departure for Avalon Hill from their other games at the time.

BGG rating 9 = "Excellent. Always want to play."

Nearly rated a 10, but can't honestly say that I expect my option will "never" change. Maybe 9.5. Still, it's my favorite old AH game, especially when played with the "secret movement rule" and a neutral umpire.

I thoroughly enjoy this game whenever I have a chance to play it.  Early on, I made up rangefinders and maneuver boards to allow us to play using triple ranges (which are actually scaled to the counters).  The damage system is simple--gunnery hits on capital ships knock out gunnery factors until they're all gone, then start inflicting hull damage.  When hull damage hits twice the protection factor for a ship, it sinks.  If a ship takes a number of hits equal to its protection factor in a single 10-minute turn, it blows up and sinks immediately--the British battlecruiser classes which blew up at Jutland all have low protection factors (e.g. 4) while the German battleships have protection factors in the range of 14, making them much harder to sink.

Light ships are handled as single-counter squadrons (cruisers) or flotillas or half-flotillas (destroyers) with multiple hit boxes per counter.  Each hit box for the multiple-ship counters represents one ship of the relevant type.

Strategic maneuvering is handled via pencil and paper on an 8-1/2 x 11 "turn record sheet" divided into hexes at the scale of 36,000 yards per hex.  When fleets get into sighting range of one another, they are placed on the table or floor at the appropriate distances, directions, and courses figured out from the hex grid, and the battle starts.  Multiple simultaneous battles are possible if players split their fleets up, but usually both sides are looking to catch part of the enemy fleet with their entire one, resulting in one big battle.

WWI gets rare enough treatment, but WWI naval games are virtually non-existent.  The search phase is usually a drag, trying to locate the opposing force.  Where Jutland really shines is the battle board.  With two well-versed players, creating opposing forces not in the rule book makes for an exciting battle.

Seems like an ancestor of the GWAS series (at least the operational part).

Who wouldn't like crawling around on the floor, measuring the distance between ship counters, and gloating every time you blow up one of your opponent's ships?  A classic.

This game was fun on the floor moving your lines of ships in position, but I really get a lot more out of war games that have hexes or squares or the like, so you don't have to constantly measure things.

I found a 1967 version still in its shrink wrap on April 13th, 2015. I still haven't opened it yet as there has been so many other things going on at this time of my life. One day I'll open it up and play the game.

Crude and ugly by modern standards. But it was fun to play more than 30 years ago. Recently acquired a copy and got to check it out again. Found nothing there worth saving except the search maps. These days I play Fleet Action Imminent (GQ3 for WW1) from Old Dominion using 1:2400 scale miniatures. Much better than the cardboard.

Really fun for the tactical aspects of WWI naval combat, but it just fails the Strategic level tests. You really can't work that aspect out well and bring about a meaningful clash within the game system without getting way outside historic probabilities. The Germans were not going to have a head to head clash unless they had numbers on their side. The British were determined to lure the Germans into a large scale trap. Ultimately the Germans ended up sitting in port most of the war. What's that about in context of the game? thumb twiddling, that's what.

some has said its a couple of house rules away from perfect...that may be true .. .

my only bugbear is the way the light forces are handled
I think LCs at 2 per counter and DDs at 4 per counter would have added very little to book-keeping and time - and much more to play flexibility and chrome

just re-acquired it and looking forward to playing

An outstanding game for it's time and way ahead of its time in fact. It has been eclipsed by more 'realistic' naval miniatures games but I don't think has been 'bettered' in terms of simplicity and plain 'fun'.

Another big favorite at our wargame club. It was minatures on cardboard. We would get ten or so players together and have huge naval battles on our school gynasium floor.
The PE teacher thought we were obsesive nuts. But he thought it was better than drugs or booze use. Later we got him hooked on it with us. He was ex-navy and turned out to be better at this than all of us.
When I graduated he asked me to sell it to him. I did and heard he was fighting WW1 naval battles for years after.
It was sure a lot of fun. Played fast because we all moved at the same time. Made for very interesting battles. 
I remember one free for all where we all battled each other without regard for nationalities. Ships were sinking and burning everywhere.

Fun dexterity game for kids, and it's a blast to destroy the city.  Just not one of those games you can play over and over again.

RATING: 7
Great game to play with the kids! There is no dice, or spinners, or spaces for movement. Your movement is how hard can you flick it! Destroying buildings? Drop your monster on it! This game is completely hands on and the kids have a blast!

Hmm, I can't believe I haven't commented on this one yet. This is a quirky, fun game. I have yet to meet someone who hates it (okay, maybe one or two, but those are few). I have the Rampage edition.

Very fun, lively, light-hearted, unique. Drop, flick, blow! 
The only problem: hitting corners and edges damages the board and components easily. :/

This game is just a ridiculous amount of fun!  Played with 4 and with 7 players (requires 2 sets.)  I just love it.  SO FUN!  There's also a surprising amount of strategy and tactics given how dexterity based it is.

RATING: 7.5
I nearly like the better than Flick 'Em Up. The theme is even more fun (if that were possible!) and the rules system is better executed - simply because it deals with all types of situations - such as meeple escaping to become an end game timer. All of the special abilities are fun too - and are reminiscent of King of Tokyo. It again is pretty much a toy, but unlike Flick, it supports some thinking and longer range movement and strategy. So thumbs up - for production, theme, and approachability - very nicely done.

RATING: 9
Flicktastic! This game is like playing the actual rampage video game but better. It's too bad that the game company had to change their game title as this fits the game perfectly. You build a cardboard city (best if everyone helps as this can be time consuming) then use your monsters to tear it down. The goal? To turn the city into your piñata and knock out delicious delicious meeples which you try to eat in sets of while also trying to destroy buildings and knock out other monsters teeth with busses for points through flicking, dropping, and blowing your way to victory. This game is just fun. Fun fun fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
This is the original "Rampage" copy, not "Terror in Meeple City."

This game is very cathartic when you've had a long, stressful day. Bring a small filler for the slight set-up time involved or get everyone to help. Then, with rules tapered carefully to allow for rampant destruction without losing all the pieces, tear the city down! You must be a fun-loving person to enjoy this game because you WILL look silly playing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rampage is best when you hunger for what it does. If you want a game with deep choice, complex dynamics, and interlocking systems, you will be sorely disappointed. However, not all games NEED to be deep and brain-burning. There is space in my library for the full spectrum, and Rampage is the perfect beer-and-pretzels, casual game to get people loosened up, laughing, and having a blast (and isn't that what games are all about?).

Each player knocks their giant monster around a sturdy playing field with actual 3-dimensional buildings to knock down and little people to eat. It's goofy, fun, and over-the-top, and while victory doesn't feel as rewarding as a game like Eclipse or Twilight Struggle, and while the rules and cards can certainly lean towards the arbitrary, if played in the right mood, Rampage can make your group grin with glee.

This is a very fun game for all ages. Very simple in the execution yet can be a challenge when trying to get more difficult feats completed. The special powers help add replayability to the game as well. Some dexterity and planning, some confrontational situations may occur yet not to the point of being ridiculous. Very much recommend for families or players looking to have a non serious game to start/end the evening. Also a great game to bring non traditional players into the hobby.

It's a dex game that just didn't seem to click for me.  Great theme and production quality, though.  Some interesting mechanics, but it seemed a little off.  And it felt like the end of the game petered out a bit.  I give the game an extra point for charm.

Interesting game, pretty fun to play with younger kids.  Scoring can get very lopsided, since playing for fun and playing to win require different actions.  And it's a lot more fun to play for fun (duh).

Not something I would need to own right now, since there are a lot of meeples that would just get lost, but would consider it in the future when my kids are a bit older.

RATING: 7
+ Stickers and The Space Cowboys.

Good and crazy game. Rapage has really a strong point in its favor for the visual impact, because it's 3D, but also because everything is so coloful with its cartoony graphics. The idea of dinosaurs smashing a city is very cool! And even if the cards may be unbalanced, it doesn't matter: Rapage is a game that should be approached with a spirit different than competing in my opinion. With this whacky mechanics it's a game about shouting and laughing rather than winning.

That being said, I maybe had too high expectations, as Rampage is not as loud and histerical as I thought... or at least that depends on the group you're playing with. But no matter what it's still a very good and unique family game.

Set up is tedious, but destroying the city more than makes up for it. Becomes pretty redundant after a few games, but playing with newer players is always fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great dexterity game, tons of fun.  The only reason it's a 7 instead of a 9 is the ratio of setup time to play time: games are usually over in less than 15 minutes, and then scoring + resetting takes another 10.  I would love it if the games lasted a bit longer... maybe custom floors for the buildings that are a bit weightier would help.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
1st play: I had a good time playing this game. It played quickly and there was lots of carnage. The various cards and objectives are nice because they get people playing in different ways each time. I'm not sure if the game will outlive the novelty phase but it was fun to smash stuff.

2nd play: I liked playing this a second time, it was still fun to smash the buildings and stuff, but the game is a little longer than it needs to be, and I don't think this game has long term staying power. But it is fun for the first few games.

Fun monster romp game that isn't nearly as random as it initially seems. Once you get past the destroying aspect of the game you start to see the need to score points. How do I get the meeples I need in the right color? How do I keep the meeples my opponents need away from them. It's all very balanced and fun but still has a level of thought thrown in that elevates the game a bit.

Great game,
 10 for game play and fun
4 for proof reading (cards and rules don't add up, spelling errors in rules)
10 rules are in watch it played and well done there, 
9 for meeple awesomeness (come with stickers again+1 set extra, lost a point because only one set are girls, and those are cheer leaders, and blond)
8 for tile awesomeness (great art, both sides, but lost points because...)
0 for adhesive tiles. I opened the box. I painstakingly added the tiles. I folded the board. The foundation tiles fell off. Not one stayed more than 5 min. Need to figure out a good glue.

RATING: 8
Just an absolute blast. Played it 4 way, can't really imagine playing it with less (though I could see a two way brawl perhaps actually becoming somewhat tactical between a couple of gamers). The scoring system incentivizes you to watch others closely and plan ahead, but you can throw all that out the window and just have fun flicking buses at people too. Great game, especially if you have no dexterity game in your library
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The only problem with Rampage is that the scoring is absolutely nonsensical and powers like Passionate Kiss can randomly break the game.  The gameplay itself is great - very silly, but there's nothing wrong with that.  It's a light game with good production value and a gimmick that it executes well.

Out of the shrink wrap, it took a solid hour to punch out and apply all the stickers, AND thanks to the lousy stickers on the cardboard, I had to use additional glue to secure the ruin/foundation tiles onto the game board...

Absolute blast of a dexterity game.  The kids and adults here love it equally.

RATING: 7
Rampaging destructive fun and games. Blow a building over. Drop your monster onto a structure to demolish it. Or hurl a bus at your opponent. This is just plain childish fun locked into a board game that has some good mechanisms. At first glance you may think it's a kids game but there is some skill and planning involved. Not much mind you but enough to not make it simply a kid's game. So break it out and go on a RAMPAGE!

The theme of this game is full of nostalgia for me and I really wanted to like it. But it just felt too long and not "fun" enough to warrant additional plays. I think it might be a fun party game, but it has a lot of strategic dexterity that I think pushes it out too far from being something I'd break out with a bunch of people at a party. It's a fun experience and I'm glad that I tried it, but I don't think I need to play it again.

RATING: 5
Overall, I had a mix reaction to this game. On one hand, the game components (except the player shields) are fantastic; the cardboard is thick, the game-board comes together without any seem, and the pieces have some real weight to them. Not only does this make the game more durable, it also makes the game feels more skillful as you have more control over heavier pieces. Furthermore, the game's theme is refreshing and appropriate considering its mechanics. 

That being said, the feeling of control is a huge part for dexterity games to feel skillful; without that feeling, the gameplay feels random and the decisions/actions feel meaningless. And that is my big issue with this game... some of the actions (blowing meeples and dropping monsters) simply don't feel skillful. Thus many rewards in the game (set collection of meeples, whether players are punished/rewarded on the rampage board, etc) feel like byproducts of luck rather than skill.

The end result is a game that has a huge wow factor but whose gameplay develops into something silly. It just doesn't compare to some of the better dexterity games (Riff Raff, Crokinole, etc), which I enjoy playing multiple times in a single sitting.

A massively fun game let down by poor longevity. Flicking giant rampaging monsters and trucks at helpless wooden people is an absolute blast for the first play through, then you realise that that's all there is to the game. There are special ability cards that change things up a little, but a variable layout to the game board could have gone a long way to making this a more enduring game.

I've taken a couple of points off for longevity, the game rules and quality are worth an 8 at least. Excellent product quality (which it needs, given the trials you're putting the playing pieces through), and a fun game to play with friends, I'd just struggle to want to play it more than a couple of times per year.

This is the first tabletop game with dexterity (and lung-terity?) that I played. It was a bit hard to see what was going on and what I needed to do, but it was still fun.

This game is good for what it is.  It was excellent for playing with a mixed crowd of adults and children.  There are elements of skill mixed in with plenty of "take that" moments.  In the end though, people that excel at dexterity games will likely win as long as everyone doesn't gang up on them.  Ultimately, the game may be a bit long and it might get repetitive after multiple plays.  I will readily play again, but I think I am content to play other people's copies of this game.

This is everything a dexterity game needs.

Stupid family meeple-eating, building-collapsing, disc-flicking fun! Biggest complaint is we had to super glue pieces to the board in order to get them to stay put. My 10-year old loves it, so will get plenty of play.

Energetic game that is fun, interactive and light-hearted.  The rules could probably benefit from a clarification and re-do, but I was happy with the board through and through.  My copy even came with the promo meeple stickers, so I felt like a champ about it!  The glue backing on the build-your-gameboard failed basically instantly, but Gorilla Glue solved that problem.

This game really makes you feel like Godzilla, and it's so goofy that it doesn't even really feel competitive, just interactive.

RATING: 8
Formerly titled "Rampage", this game allows you to use dexterity to become a godzilla-like monster and terrorize meeples, in attempt to eat the most meeples and cause the most destruction. You can do this by smashing into buildings, throwing cars, and literally blowing meeples away. You have to be controlled however, as meeples that leave the board entirely will hurt your score. After all, you need to eat as much as you can.

Very fun, albeit not too serious, dexterity game.

We found the rule book lacking.  For such a simple fun game, we were frustrated with play and discovered we were playing it wrong.  We never saw any example of play before we got the game so we were depending totally on the rule book.  ...for example, not being able to eat meeple on rubble was a small note next to the large text rule: chow down on any exposed meeples. 

I suspect my rating will go up after I get over the initial let-down (and see an updated rule book). ...it is still a unique dexterity game that has a spot in the collection.

The one play I had of this was fun. The mechanics of the game fit the theme really well. The game ended up lasting almost twice as long as the stated length on the box and it dragged a bit at the end. We were all new to the game but with the simplicity of the rules I wouldn’t think a first play would be much slower. I would gladly play it again if in the right mood and I think it would have been as enjoyable to watch as to play.

To be completely honest, I only play this game when my youngest (5yr old) wants to play it. It's a really good concept and the gameplay can be somewhat entertaining. However, the setup and tear down can be a bit of a chore....simple and quick but a lot of work.

It feels like this is one of those games that great for a 8-10 year old but wont be played by others much. I might end up trying to sell this one after my kid outgrows it.

A light and entertaining 'live action roleplay' take on 'Godzilla and friends attack Tokyo' - the main means of destroying the cardboard and meeple buildings being to drop your monster on them or chuck trucks at them (flicked from the head of your monster), although you can also attempt to blow them, and other monsters, down - scoring points by devouring and meeples or building parts that end up in your area. Some skill at flicking pays off but the rest of the game is pretty random - unless you play enough to be really skilled at demolishing buildings by dropping your monster without catapulting most of the building's meeples outside your area and off the board - so don't sit down expecting anything other than chaos.  Fun though, as it didn't outstay its welcome.

Just plain unique dexterity-based fun!  If you've ever played any of the Rampage video games, this is the board game implementation of that.  Smash and eat stuff!

Basically, there is a map of a town, complete with buildings you construct during set up, consisting of meeples that hold up the floors of each building, with each building being several stories tall.

On your turn, you get two actions from amongst 4 options, with the goal of knocking over buildings as well as the opponents monsters.  You can:

1) Move your monster.  Your monster consists of two pieces: his feet, which is simply a disc, and his body, which is a big monster meeple that rests on the feet.  To move your monster, you just pick up the body, flick the feet, and place the body back on the disc.

2) Blow stuff down/over.  Rest your chin on your monster's head, and blow!  Preferably hard enough to cause destruction.

3) Body slam a building!  If you monsters feet are right next to a building's base, pick up your monster's body and drop it on the building, causing massive destruction!

4) Throw a bus/tank!  If there is a vehicle lying around in the region your monster stands, put it on your monster's head and flick it into something.  Again, destruction ensues if you're accurate enough!

After you're done moving/destroying things, you get to eat meeples that your dislodged from buildings according to how many teeth your monster has (you start with a lot, but other monsters will knock your teeth out by knocking you over!).  Eaten meeples will score you points!  Yum yum!  You also collect any building floors that you knocked all the meeples off from, which score points as well.

There are some other minor things, like each monster getting a unique ability and some special scoring cards, but in a nutshell, that's it!  Overall, just a very unique smash-em up game that's a real blast to play!

I bought this game because I am predisposed to liking dexterity games and am a firm believer that having a couple of high-novelty-value games is a good thing, so I figured if it wasn't that great it still would have been worth the purchase for some big monster fun every once in awhile.

Given my eagerness to just get into the theme and forgive a few flaws, I was very surprised by how little I enjoy this game. Let me start with the smallest of my complaints, which is that I am unconvinced this game is balanced in any way. It seems pretty easy for one person to fall behind by repeatedly being the one to add a dude to the lost dudes chart. But really the weirdest balance is that it seems incredibly difficult to knock dudes off into your own territory, so most of the game feels like... just giving the other players points? I realize in this game you WANT risk, but this just feels more like chaos.

But my main issue with the game is that, unlike most dexterity games, you're going to find yourself spending an awful lot of time just moving around the board without being able to do anything particularly interesting. Doing Cool Stuff Every Turn is the foundation on which dexterity games are built, and I can't believe that this game fails to achieve this basic requirement. There isn't something you're always able to do - or better yet - FORCED to do - and spreading out all of the joy inherent in laughing at your friends' missed shots, wailing at your own, and the collective oohs, ahhs, shouts, and laughs of pulling of some tricky bullshit just totally misses the mark for the genre.

Still, bitchin' production values.

Great Opener Board Game to Inexperienced or Softcore board-gamers leaving the warm fuzzy alcoholic blanket of party games to item placement, movement, map (board) awareness, basic grasp of special abilities, minor PvP interactions and how to combine all of the above in your favor to win. 
More importantly, even if you don't win you have a great time and are 110% going to remember playing it; never had an instance where someone plays it for the first time and doesn't take, at least, 1 pic or snap with it (if not more).
Great game to introduce Girlfriends to the Board Game scene (even coworkers).
Especially if they're educators! 

Recommend Good Size (center placement) of table because Meeples WILL FLY OFF BOARD; and they're too cute to lose (and you worked hard putting all those stickies on them!).

Rampage is a silly/funny dexterity game by the great and versatile designer Bauza. It’s a lot of fun, at least with non-gamers and family! It’s funny for gamers too, but only if you view it as the light game it is. It’s just plain fun to flick your monster, throw vehicles at buildings and your opponents and blow the meeples to the ground so you can devour them!

Sure, the power/scoring cards don’t seem totally balanced as some are definitely much more powerful than others, but it doesn’t really matter too much as the game is all about having fun. It did suck, however, that  I lost my first game only because one of the other players had a card which allowed him to steal 3 random meeples from me – which meant I lost a set while another played gained 10 points which made him win! That kind of sucked as I had no idea such a power card existed (my own fault), but later plays haven’t seen such events happen, and I doubt they will happen frequently. But I still don’t like that if you have 1000 meeples in various colors but no blue, you get 0 points; I think that you should get at least a couple of bonus points for having a lot of additional extra meeples at the end of the game.

The special powers and scoring cards mean that each play is somewhat different, although the overall gameplay is the same. But the two different meeple boards mean that there is some variation as to which type of meeples you need to be careful about throwing over the edge of the board.

It’s good for a non-serious play with family or when you’re in need of a “beer game” with your friends. I think it says a lot that I’ve already played it 7 times in a couple of months!

First play @ ConnCon 2014 w/ 4 players.  This game was super fun!  It really is the dexterity-based board game version of the old video game.   You will need room to get up and move freely around the table.  You will also be reaching across & above the board, as well as bending over the board to place your chin atop your monster.

Each person plays a monster in which you try to destroy different building and eating different colored meeples.  These meeples give different points depending on your objective cares and sets of colors you complete.  It's a silly game, but rather fun.

In a nutshell, I was disappointed by this game.  A silly dexterity game with mass destruction sounded like ti would be a lot of fun.  But the rules and conditions just were too fiddly.

While I think our game went overly long and that was part of the problem, it just wasn't very much fun.  If someone suggests it I'll play it again, but I won't suggest it and I certainly don't need to own it.

Bastante peor de lo que me esperaba, que decepción :( Me alegro de no haberlo comprado para mi.
Las cosas malas: Los poderes. Están totalmente descompensados, hay de muy burros y de infinitamente inútiles. Una pena. A parte de eso (que se podria mirar de arreglar, creo... nah, creo que no u.u) el juego muy bueno. Y se agradece la calidad de los componentes, porque van a sufrir xD Eso si, un feo que las pegatinas de los meeples no vengan incluidas, el juego es 1000 veces más vistoso con ellas.

Components: Outstanding components. Meeple stickers with both a front and a back. Entertaining detail on the board and building tiles. Big chunky monsters. Fun artwork on the cards.

Experience: Chaotic and fun. There's a real sense of geography as the city is destroyed, and the monsters must maneuver around the rubble. But because of the nuance of flicking and moving around the table, we had a lot of rules questions.

Rampage is a fun group game that keeps players engaged during other player turns.
For being so light there are still plenty of options on your turn.  And if you get bored, then try to knock the other guys teeth out so he can't score.

It is ok.  I like plenty of light games but this one just doesn't live up to the "fun" that it is supposed to be.  It's not a bad game at all, nice components, etc. (although it's a bit annoying that those thick boards tend to warp slightly, which throws of the flicking aspect). It does hit the table on a rare occasion with my 2nd-grader.  The concept of the game is good.  There's something about it that falls flat - but I don't know what it would take to make it more to my liking (I'm not a designer).

Silly game, that works ok.  You are at the mercy of a lot of randomness, so this one really has to boil down to theme and the overall experience of being a monster and knocking buildings down.  I wish there was more game to it, or if it's going to be that random it should play a lot faster.   The no man's land of longer than a filler, but too random to really play to win makes this one something I won't look to play again.   It's probably a lot better as a house ruled free for all with kids.

I liked this a lot better the first time I played it, based on sheer uniqueness.  But it tends to drag on too long for what it is, so I had to ding it a little.  Still enjoyable, even if it isn't in the same league as Catacombs.

RATING: 6.5
This is a nice one, but the scoring is a little obtuse. It feels a bit counterintuitive that you want to collect sets of meeples given that the fun is in destroying as much as possible. Looks great set up though and I would really enjoy playing a massive game with either two or four sets together.

Players are monsters rampaging their way through Meeple City on path of destruction.  Stunning and very fun game where players take two actions with their chunky monster pieces.  They may flick their monster base to move their monster through the city; drop their monster piece on top of an adjacent building; pick up nearby vehicle and flick it at a target; or put their chin on their monster and blow their own breath at a target.

The game is all about dislodging meeple pieces from the three dimensional buildings, so they can be gobbled up for victory points.  Special power cards add abilities to the monsters.  Points are awarded at the end of the game for sets of meeples eaten.

Glorious looking game - stunning components, and ridiculous, addictive game play.  Instant hit.

You bash down a map's worth of buildings and meeples by flicking and dropping wooden pieces all over the place. You play as giant monsters and one of your abilities involves placing your chin on your monster and using your breath to push stuff across the board.

Are you sold yet? If not you'll probably hate this game.

Beyond what I said above, the game has some randomly dispensed ability/victory cards to make the experience different each time.

"A game that many want to try but few want to own".  That's what Jon said, and he's probably right.   I love the concept and the production.   The Euro scoring feels a bit tacked on, and it seems like there is one too many layers of rules for a simple dexterity game.   Not that the rules are hard.  They aren't.  They are there to help drive strategy, but I'm just not sure how much strategy I want in this game.   Still, it's fun to play, and I'm glad to have friends who own it.

[b][FirstImpression20thNov2013][/b]My initial thought about the game before I even get to play it was that this is a silly fun game. So silly that I don't think it's even fun to play. 

Right after we started the game, I can see it turned to be a fun game, and I immediately said I need to buy this game. I wished the game can accommodate more players (maybe 6; you can if you buy two copies and play in team). After a while, I got bored and the thought of buying this game just vanished. I probably need another 1-2 solid play (with no mistakes) to actually form a fair opinion.

I have to admit, I was really enthusiast in the early rounds of the game. A lot of funny moments occurred especially when your plan didn't go as you have planned.

Played this at BGGcon and loved it! It took awhile to finally get a chance to play this because there was always a line. First off, it feels true to form with the game because not only are you knocking over buildings you're going at it with the other monsters. The game is a fun dex game that has the theme of King of Tokyo. But there's so many options for play. We watched games that were quick because people were being very aggressive and games that were well thought out and very tactical. I would love to have this game!

I wasn't really expecting to like this game as much as I do.  I usually find most dexterity games fun and novel the first couple times I play them and then I don't care if I never play them again.

There's something about wrecking the board, flicking vehicles at opponents, and collecting sets of meeples that I find deeply satisfying.  The special abilities are a great touch as well.  Fantastic fun game!

I bought this game during the original Kickstarter (back when it was called "Rampage" before the licensing issues).  Most of the reason that I got interested was the nostalgia for the classic video game.  While the board game does retain some of the theme, it is a bit lacking compared to the video game.  You still take on the role of large monsters destroying a city and eating people though.  The components are pretty nice (although all of the monsters look identical which was depressing considering the cool characters in the Rampage video game).

Players use their own manual dexterity to drop their monsters onto the game board and physically knock over buildings.  It can be a lot of fun, especially for younger players, but at the same time you have to be wary of meeples and other components being knocked off the table and getting lost.

Once I'd stuck a gazillion meeple stickers on, I was more than ready for this game. Look...it's not a deep & meaningful game. There's no risk of prolonged AP. Funny & enjoyable game where you get to throw the components around & generally upset the board. Not a good one for people with OCD or those who cringe at the idea of component drops. Loads of silly fun to be had by all!

I actually liked Rampage a lot, and was somewhat sad to get rid of it, but it never got played, and was a pain to set up.  The scoring part of the game felt almost secondary, and didn't really seem like it rewarded skillful plays so much as blind luck.  If I'm going to suggest a dexterity game, it's probably going to be Junk Art, so Rampage just wasn't going to see the table.

I loved the computer game as a kid, and this is a fantastic, unusual, innovative boardgame adaptation. It turns out that smashing a city is a lot harder than you'd expect.

The rulebook contains some annoying gaps.

RATING: 9.1
Who doesn't like destroying something then eating it!  We like and tend to play games more based on entertainment value than complexity or balanced mechanics. This embodies that fully.  A game where anyone can play and almost no one could completely dominate or master for long.

RATING: 7
A very well-produced dexterity, set-collection game all about monsters gathering as many meeples of various types as possible while occasionally beating each other up. It's fun to see the destruction develop on the board as buildings fall apart and meeples scatter.  I don't know that it has much staying power, but it's a pretty cool game to try at least once.

Fantastic game with a daring combination of silliness, dexterity, and euro-style resource management. Adults can have just as much fun as kids.

My version is called Rampage; apparently they changed the name?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
More fun with  full compliment of players. The dexterity mechanics take a little getting used to and it is definitely not as easy as it looks to be. There is a lot of satisfaction to be had here just from breaking the buildings and when you line up that perfect shot with the truck and get a great ricochet! Lively an boisterous. There is no need for chairs to be around the table with this game.

Nagyon vicces, nagyon jópofa játékmenet. Megmondom őszintén elsőre nehezen értettem, hogy hogy nem fog minden darabjaira hullani az első rombolásnál. De szuper jól meg vannak csinálva az elemek és tényleg nem egyszerű lerombolni az épületeket. Így az egész tényleg jól összeáll egy ügyességi partyjátékka. Egyedül a pontozást tartom bénának. Ez set gyűjtés egyáltalán nem tematikus, ráadásul irreálisan túl van pontozva. Ha nincs seted, akkor semmi esélyed. Ráadásul a célkártyák is elég imbák. Egy ilyen komolyságú játéknál hajlamos vagyok ezt elnézni, mert simán lehet házi szabállyal játszani, de nem értem, hogy miért volt ez így logikus Bauza bácsinak.

RAMPAGE!  Oops that's copyrighted!  Terror in Meeple City is a ode to the classic Coin Op game. And it's done with a lot of attention to detail on the board game side of things.  A Bit of strategy, luck and dexterity not to mention terrific components make this a classic game for everyone.

Got this on a clearance sale, and it has been sitting on my shelf for a number of months. I was worried this wouldnt be the kind of game that my husband and I would like. Happy to report I was totally wrong. This was actually really fun. Its basically just loud and destructive, with no real strategy. but sometimes, just loud fun is really what the doctor ordered. My main quibble is that it is fiddly to set up...and dont get too attached to the components...chances are they will get bent, meeples lost down air vents. cards with beer spilled on them...its just one of those games. I would be happy to pull this out on a game night with some buddies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
OK. This is exactly the game I thought it would be, but what surprised me was how well they thematically made controlling one's dexterity actions important. The buildings have bases that prevent one from flicking the buildings into obscurity. Also, meeples that escape the board are considered to be escaped victims which helps them fight back. 

It's so simple and brilliant. There is much to the game that is strategic (although entirely dexterity based). That said, this is not a game one could play multiple times in a day (unlike Catacombs). Still, a great game for what it is.

Played once and never will again. Sorry, really can't see what people like about this game. IMHO the artwork is disgusting and the game itself is not worth playing even with 3 year old kids. Looking out of the window, watching the grass grow is more fun to me. I'm just not getting it, sorry...even not as a gateway game. I see everyone, whom I'm trying to get into the hobby, asking me "that's what you're doing at your weekly gaming meetings?" after playing Rampage with them. I hardly can imagine that any newbies would become gamers after playing such nonsense...as a gateway I'd rather try Ticket to Ride or Kingdom Builder. Actually this is a toy, not a game. Just my opinion...

Finally got to play Rampage! It was as random and ridiculous as I assumed it was going to be, but I think I enjoyed it a little bit more than I assumed I would. This is all about flicking, flinging and smashing and creating some sort of point system out of it. I think the notable designers did the best they could and I like the cards that change up powers and abilities and the two different Runaway Meeple systems. So, not a game I would always want to play but definitely one I would play again if I was in a lighter, sillier mood!

The dexterity part of this game just didn't feel satisfying. The board is too rigid and the pieces are too heavy, for a game like this I would have expected to be able to level a building in a single turn, but because I can't it feels bad to even try. The actual game is also a bit unbalanced, certain powers are just better than others and it's easy to gang up on a player and leave them crippled without any cost to yourself. 

The set-up is also very long, if I could be done with the game in 30 minutes I would have looked past the unbalance and sluggishness, but this game, including set-up and tear-down took almost 2 hours when I played it.

There are also far too many and fiddly rules for this kind of game!

One play with three and one play with four. A dexterity game with a neat concept and a fun theme. Special powers, secret powers, and individual goals are thrown in, of course. How well does it actually work, though? Okay, I guess. It's hard to do the things you're supposed to do, frankly, so it doesn't feel very satisfying to me, and the actual "game" part of it isn't that interesting. Still, it's okay to play every once in a while if nobody feels like thinking.

A really fun (especially funny) dexterity game where you take your monsters and completely destroy the city (or attack the other monsters to steal their points). There's lots of different possible tactics and lots of really great theme, so as a game, it's great, but even as an activity it's actually still lots of fun - sometimes you even forget to worry about the points at all, and destroying the city in the most fun way possible becomes even more satisfying than winning the game.

They could have come up with a better way to bring back the old Rampage video game. King of Tokyo is much more fun, and King of New York leaves this game a millions light years behind it.

This game finally motivated me to make my first comment. I just want to say that it's more than just a silly/fun exercise in destruction. It's a tactical game with a wide variety of character, power and special power cards that truly change how you play it. The combination of these cards, the set collection point scoring mechanic that makes you eat selectively and the harsh punishments for adding runaway meeples at the wrong time, add up to make this game everything I hoped it would be. It's fantastically fun and actually gets better, not worse, with multiple plays. I'm holding off on rating it a 10 just because I want to see how it plays with different people and whether the replaybability truly stands the test of time. So far, I've been pleasantly surprised with the variety of people who like it, including my girlfriend, who thought it looked stupid. This game is truly unique and fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.

Very light-hearted & fun game. Smashing buildings and eating soldiers is great fun (BGG store).
The rules are pretty clever, because they keep you from flipping all meeples from the board by saying those escaped & give you penalties. So with all the meeple colour collection it can become a little tactical. Then sadly the different power & victory cards are very unbalanced.. but well.. still a great romp!

I didn't play this one very often, but when I did it was great fun! This game is truly unique. One of the most beautiful games I owned, for sure. The reason I traded it was simply because it didn't see the table anymore, as I'd rather play Flick 'Em Up. Rampage has a problem of being too complex for the people it was supposed to appeal to. They understand the rules all right, but they can't dive in it fully and might feel overwhelmed by the abilities and other smaller details.

Great dexterity game for 2-4 players. If the random flipping of coconuts does not satisfy you, try rampage. My wife loves it. The setup takes a bit of time but well worth the effort.

Just amazing. Amazing amazing amazing. 'Real' rules lead to actual strategy and tactics and give adults a legitimate reason to play with wooden monsters, smash buildings to bits, send meeples flying, blow things over, flick cars at each other and laugh and shout and point and cheer. Each game we play of this turns out to be an event, I haven't had this much real fun in 'proper' gaming for a very long time. As I might have said before, AMAZING.

Played once, basically new. Sticker sheet has already been applied to all of the meeples.  One of the black meeples came with missing part of his head, and it came with an extra Red meeple. We just used the messed up meeple on top of the building where he wasn't supporting anything.

FUN! I love this game... sadly I think I have more nostalgia for the video game than most. You get to control dinosaur / lizard creatures (legally distict from Godzilla) and use them to destroy a city and eat various items and meeple along the way. Good for a group who is just looking for a playful game. No real point to the game besides just eating as much as possible. Wish it made it to the table more often.

cool blend of theme and dexterity test;

2nd play using Powers & Character cards; there's a surprising strategic depth to the game when playing with the cards

Update Jan. '17:  the game hasn't gotten to the table very often, but 'hoping this changes in the near future, as the kids are a little older, I'm a little less anal about setup (Lighten up, Francis), and at least one of the kids isn't turned off by the length of the game (games seemed to last longer than was desirable ... the rating was lowered by 1 for this reason). Haven't given up on this one just yet ...

You will struggle to have as much fun playing a board game as you will with Meeple City. A light family friendly game of destruction, it doesn't take itself serious at all. Components are great. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the concept a lot, but the Character, Power, and Superpower Cards are quite unbalanced and reduce the skill required to win with some combinations.

The Character Cards can disincentivize interaction and create unfair scoring potential if three players need gray meeples to win, and the fourth player doesn't, so I recommend a scoring variant where all players score points for each Character Card revealed at the beginning of the game to create more interaction.

The Super/Power cards are unbalanced and should be drafted before-hand, removed altogether, or buffed/nerfed if you care about fairness in this silly game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Thoughts after first play: I guess that instead of the "delicate dexterity mode" in which we tried to get the most points, the game probably is flexible enough that you can simply have fun causing chaos on the board, tearing everything down without caring much for scoring.

RATING: 6.3
Rampage is a fun, light dexterity game where you control a wooden monster as it tears through stacks of cardboard buildings teaming with meeples.  It seems to be the perfect choice for occasions where you want to play a game with a lot of laughs, but very little thought.  While there is almost no analytical strategy here, the unique goofiness of the game makes it very appealing.  The components and artwork are top notch.

I really wanted to play it, expecting that I would hate it and never want to play it again.  I wasn't far off in that.  In the right circumstance with the right people I might play it again, but I don't think I'll miss it if I don't.  It's a really cool concept, but not really something that suits me.  The fun wore off pretty quickly.  And it didn't help that the rules were unclear on a lot of things.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2014)

WOW what a surprise. I didn’t had the slightest desire to play this as I thought it was similar to the crappy (IMO) King of Tokyo, but this game is actually fun. It has very easy rules that can be taught  quickly, the components are great, nice art (love the references to other games) and great gameplay. There is not much strategy, but Rampage makes for it in fun. To move you have to flick your monster (a la Ascending Empires) , and the fighting is great to unleash. The cards have great art and are very humorous.

Not much bad to say about the game. Sometimes a game can take longer than I would like. Also, with all the flicking and destroying, I guess the components, (most of all the floors) will suffer a lot more than in other games (a monster finished in my lunch last time), that is a big issue for me and I guess I won’t buy the game solely for this reason. I’m very anal about my games and I like to have them in mint condition. The cards offer a lot of uncontrollable randomness, but this is a minor concern in this kind of game.

Bottom line, I won’t be buying Rampage anytime soon, but I would not say no to a game. This is a very fun game suitable for the family. I´m rating it a 6.5 because, although fun, this is not a game I would like to play too often.

2013-12-30 - This game is just a lot of silly fun. Flicking wooden pieces around a board, destroying stacks of wood and cardboard. It's a blast. And there's some decisions to make, too. It's not mindless destruction, your monster has goals! And special powers! It's not a thinky game or anything, but there's more to it than I at first thought. This is our first dexterity game, so I don't know how it compares to others, but the theme and mechanics are a blast.

2017-11-06 - This is a really great novelty game, and I think I'll always have it my collection, but I'm only likely to pull it out for kids or newer gamers.

Rampage is a blast.  Watching the board be destroyed over time is really an amazing thing.  Watching the meeples run for their lives or hide under structures is hilarious.

Lots of bits in this game and plenty of stickering to be done. Setup time is a bit long and some of the dexterity actions like blowing and flicking can be tough for the younger players.

Exactly as much fun as the game description suggests. Flicking and tossing your pieces around to wreak destruction and devour meeples is so incredibly satisfying. Made even more fun with more players, as you start to interfere with the plans of others. Wrap in some special powers and hidden objectives, and you've got a highly satisfying (if not terribly deep) game that can be enjoyed in less than an hour.

Good production values and a fun atmosphere.  I found it entertaining to play once but couldn't see revisiting it unless it was to entertain a younger audience (who may have their own issues with how heavily the game punishes bad play).  Would rather play King of Tokyo for a similar theme (packaged with very different mechanics) or Catacombs for a dexterity game.

I can't fully or rationally explain my antipathy for this game, but the first play was a "4" and the second a "3." For me, it's just too long, too random, too unbalanced in card design, and, in short, almost the antithesis of fun. I don't hate dexterity games--I enjoy though I am pretty awful at PitchCar and Sorry! Sliders--but the dexterity component here is wedged into a fairly poorly implemented set collection game that's both heavily luck dependent and marred by poorly balanced variable player powers. I do hope others like it because it would seem like a really good idea, but King of Tokyo and even Smash Up do a better implementation of a light big-monsters game.

The very essence of "Fun in a Box". While I can't say it's my favorite game, that is mostly because it doesn't tickle the specific things I like tickled. But that doesn't matter. This game takes me back to being a kid, playing with toys. Throwing things, building things up, and knocking them down.

Only now, it's competitive. And you get points for it.

This has to hit the table regularly, but not repetitively. That's how it will have staying power.

Rampage is a dexterity godzilla game.
Antoine and Ludovic nailed the playing time and scoring in sets is probably right too. 

Quality of components is great and it needs to be. 
I probably would have approached the monster faces differently with masks with pullable teeth but that would be it :D

RATING: 3
Nice toy, where is the game? To be better game Rampage would need different board to make moves & other maneuvers and different board for the destruction. Idea is good, but it needs a lot of tweaking. Oh, and one game just takes too long...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In Rampage, you arrive in Meeple City as a gigantic, famished, scaly-skinned monster! Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples – in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.

In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.

Rampage includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.

RATING: 6
Silly and light-hearted fun, but sadly not as enjoyable as I expected it to be. Still, I respect the indeed interesting and unique concept, nice integration of theme and quality of components.

Great for most kids (of any age) -- just be prepared to find components under your furniture for years to come.

RATING: 8
Moved rating from 7 to 8.  While the game doesn't have deep strategic depth, there is something about this game that is just silly fun that I love to pull it out to play when people are in a silly/light game mood.  I could see it getting quite repetitive and old if played too often in a short period of time.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This was just chaotic fun dropping, blowing and flicking things around.  Theme comes through very strongly.  Rules weren't as bad as I had thought them to be as I felt most things were fairly clear.  Setup takes some time.  Losing teeth is painful as it really limits point intake.  Don't take this one too seriously and roll with the punches.

As an homage to the videogame and the rampaging giant monster concept, this one does a lot of stuff right. The meeple-filled buildings, throwing cars, blowing stuff down with your own radioactive breath, it's all a lot of sloppy, goofy fun, and you'll have a fun time with it. As a game, though, it leaves some to be desired. The special powers are all over the place as far as usefulness, and be prepared to make a lot of judgment calls on rules. Ultimately, I had some fun, but not nearly as much as I felt like the game thought it was pushing at me.

I'm not big on dexterity games, but the concept behind this one - monsters destroying a city - is just too cool to pass up. The components are fantastic, which is crucial in a game like this, and they really help the theme to come through.

The inclusion of two different ways of scoring bonuses, plus a whole load of special abilities and hidden goals, means that strategy plays a part in the game. I also love that there are a couple of different moves that players can perform, which test your skills in different ways.

This is good fun, and one of the better dexterity games there is.

This sounded like a hoot, and it is. It was fun to build the board (which has stick-on raised areas and fits together like a puzzle) and sticker the jumbo monster meeples, and it's just as fun to play. Setup looks like a pain, but even with just two people it actually goes by pretty quickly.

All four of the basic actions are fun in practice, and I love being able to engage with a game in ways that just don't feature in most games -- even most dexterity games I've played. I also like that it's a mix of light strategy, tactical thinking, and dexterity; there's something here for anyone who's not turned off by the idea of blowing on the board and dropping stuff to cause chaos.

It's easy to learn and teach, and it plays quickly. I've only played it with two so far, and that can mean you rampage around your own section of the board for a while without engaging each other. With four, I imagine it'd be pure chaos.

Awesome idea. The execution isn't perfect, you aren't guaranteed to have fun. Sometimes the flicks go so that you won't have much player interaction or buildings will fall really quickly, but most of the time it's fun.

* Rampage works very well with two, but there's more mayhem with 3 or 4 players.

This could be fun...but definitely needs a referee as the game can get out of control fast.

Also, the setup can be a little boring for everyone involved.

After playing I didn't mind anymore that the game isn't cheaper.

This game is a winner for me. I guess it's a must have if you like dexterity games, it really is a lot of fun. To me it has all the Godzilla theme I want in a fun way. Even works as a two player. Although some of the cards are more effective with more players and you'll probably have more of a party atmosphere with more players I think there's more control with 2, because it's even possible to set up things for your next turn that way.

My son enjoys this one a lot.

What’s not to like about  a game where you can smash, flick and even blow you opponents over all while smashing a city to pieces? Basically, each player is a monster who has decided to smash a section of the city apart.  Points are scored for destroying buildings, consuming meeples (in a set of six colours) and meeting your secret objective. Each turn you have two actions that can be used to move, smash a building or attack other monsters.

You can also attack the other monsters (this game plays up to four) by picking up wooden vehicles and flicking them at your opponents or even blowing them over. You’ll also have a special ability (from a set of cards) that may give you unique offensive or defensive abilities. As the effectiveness of your actions is determined by the player’s ability to flick, blow or drop the canny player will usually triumph over the one who relies on brute strength.

This is a loud and active physical game and can (and probably should)  be noisy as the players cause mayhem as their monsters tear the heart out of Meeple City. It’s terrific fun! Recommended to any gamer who likes a bit of lighthearted fun, just make sure you have a stable playing surface and a bit of room to move about around the board.

Impression after 1 play:  I played an 8-player game with 2 boxes combined.  It was too long and slow with too little to do and too much down-time between your turn.  I might recommend this to friends with children who are interested in the theme, but it's not for me.

Of all my recent and many purchases, this title has come to the table the most with a variety of gamer types participating and requesting it. How all of the 'hard core' gamers give it one play, have a great time, and then still dismiss this game only proves to be narrow minded stupidity. It's a great game because it's FUN! And it belongs in the top 50.

RATING: 7
A relatively unique game where the theme of smashing up a city really comes through in the rules and the components.

Dexterity is critical in this game, but I think its best played lightheartedly and quickly rather than being overanaylsed. 

Be careful of meeples getting into player's eyes, seriously. Perhaps the game should come with safety glasses for all players!

This is a fun, unique, and wild dexterity game with amazing components. It didn't fully click with me because the rules didn't encourage me to destroy things as much as I wanted to. The rules were also a little more confusing than I felt they should be for what it is. I wanted more destructive dexterity options available to me each turn.

Entertaining dexterity game with a bit of strategy based on your character's special ability that lends to a different strategy each game.  I like it more than my friends and family, if only for a few clunky mechanics that new players have to grasp.  Once we played it a few times, the game speed through at a nice pace and I found it be a great experience, not typically found the board gaming community!  Also of note, a drunk ground may find this difficult to succeed in.  Recommend early in the night before too many cocktails get put down!

I liked this game a lot the first time I played it, but I'm glad I didn't rush out to buy it. I can't say what it is about this game, but I like it a little bit less each time I play it although it's still very fun with the right group. I would only play it with four players though.

RATING: 7.5
It could just be the way my friends play, but all of my games have progressed to the point where we are just trying to knock over each others monster and go after the buildings secondarily.

I do not generally like games that can breed a revenge mentality and that seems to be what happens here. I get knocked over, and I feel like I have to knock them back over, even though it may not be the best choice.

Even with those problems of my own making, I do still enjoy the game and it is a fun change of pace from the heavier games I own.

Rampage...! Huge fan of the old arcade game. First play of our copy earlier tonight. It was alright, my girlfriend and I both had fun and laughed a fair bit, but definitely felt a bit lacking overall. Looks amazing, and is certainly innovative. Plays unlike everything else we have, but was a little light and casual for our tastes. Seemed like a good gateway, though the gameplay isn't a great representative of how thrilling board games can be. Not disappointed in the buy, but doubt we'll get it out of the box all that often.

Not that much fun to set up, but really a good time in the breaking down. There's a game component (i.e., rules and victory conditions) but like its arcade namesake, it's really more of an activity than a game. I'd rather my friends have this than me, though. Impressively, Bauza's games seem to run the gamut.

Silly dexterity game about thowing stuff and blowing things off. I say silly because it's not to be taken seriously, your objective is to have fun.

As many of those games, but once you start to play, you get drawn into it. The funniest thing is to fight against other monsters. 

The game is quite original though, I have not seen similar games around.

A perfect party game for conventions: you need 2 minutes to learn how to play it and it draws lots of attention.

It's very eye catching: it's the game you first notice when going to conventions.

It has several problems though:
-> Setup: lengthy!
-> Pieces will fall out of the table, easy to lose them (I think it comes with 1 meeple of each color in excess).
-> Quite a few small rules for extreme cases
-> It last double of the advertised 30 min. Add it to the setup, and it's a bit too much for such a light game.

Gioco molto divertente, specie se giocato in maniera leggera e con dei bambini. Il gioco pecca molto di longevità, dopo poche partite infatti potrebbe stancare ed inoltre ha un prezzo decisamente levato, anche se non mancano i materiali. Una buona idea per un discreto giochino.

RATING: 6.5
Chaotic and decidedly mad dexterity nonsense, my biggest disappointment being in how easy it is to actually destroy the buildings (more rigidity required, methinks). Still, the range of special abilities and endgame bonuses is a nice touch, as is the ability to go all-out and attack the opposition.

A fun dexterity game (actually, four fun dexterity games) coupled with a boring scoring mechanism (set collection – blah!) and unneeded complexities (goals, powers, hidden powers – yawn...).

[i]My son picked this out at Total Con last year and we played it a bunch that month, then it sat on the shelf. My kids played it a few times, but my wife and I didn't enjoy it at all. I thought the game would be much more fun than it is, there are moments of fun with a lot of frustration in between those moments. Worst part is that I spent an hour applying stickers to the pieces this summer only for the game to never get played again.[/i]

A dexterity game of flicking monsters to topple buildings. What's there not to like! Well, maybe the scoring system. But I kind of don't care.

There's so much charm that I can overlook the arbitrary scoring.

Absolutely great dexterity game! It takes a little time to set up the board before playing and a little time to check your monster's special powers...but it's worth it! There was a lot of play testing for this special game. The components, special powers, stickers, artwork and rules are so well thought out and humerus too that you will have a great time playing. I think it's a game for everyone and a good party game or late night laughable filler.

Ridiculously fun and stupid.  I wish this could be a lawn-sized game where you could actually BE the monster.  (Maybe using a leaf-blower for your roar attack.)  I mean, how much fun would it be to throw a big truck at a "building" and knock it down!

RATING: 5
Updated: Fun with the kids, BUT...I think it's got more style than substance.  It ends up being a lot of maintenance and nitpicks for not a lot of payoff.  

And it's not as kid-friendly as it seems.  We had to modify by slowly rotating and scooting the board because none of our young children could reach to grab pieces or flick, and especially the move when you place your chin on your piece and blow down the buildings.  You actually kind of play on eggshells because it's hard for little hands and fingers not to knock over things inadvertently, and then they have trouble flicking with force or accuracy.  My kids can play King of Tokyo by themselves, but there is no way they could play this.

I think you have to keep this moving and finish in less than 10 minutes in order for it to not outstay its welcome.  It's the kind of thing that is so novel and cool looking that it would be fun with anyone once.  However, the set-up, rules, and scoring take so much time and effort that it doesn't have a lot of replay value.

Flick your puck/monster around Crokinole style to a good spot and then throw things at the board in one of three different ways - drop your monster on an adjacent building, flick a block off the top of your monster, or blow something over with your chin held above your monster. All of which cause mayhem and destruction on the board, usually resulting in buildings, which are being held up by meeples, being knocked down, hoping they fall in such a way so that meeples fall inside the same area of the board that your puck/monster is in so you can pick them up at the end of your turn. There are potential penalties if meeples leave the board, so care needs to be taken. Knocking over another player's monster also gets points and is to be encouraged. So, lots of semi-random mayhem which is fun to start with, stays fun through the middle bit and then gets less so as the repetition kicks in and you realise how much luck is involved in the scoring. Meaning some frustration and/or ennui will probably rise as a result. Each set of 6 different meeple colours scores 10 points - be short a colour and boom, you're 20 or 30 points down. Don't be emotionally invested. It's some decent stupid fun that no doubt realises its full potential when played with tween boys.

UPDATE+1year: We tried again 1 year later and the kids are slightly older and they loved it. So I have increased my scoring and would now recommend for kids 8+ (only if playing with adults). Also I could mention that setting up for the first time does take a good 30 minutes with all the parts.

Very fun game--probably my favorite dexterity game.  The powers are great to differentiate your monsters like in King of Tokyo.  It's very fun to wreck other people and the city and should be good for all ages.  I like the strategy involved about attacking others, run-away meeple effects, meeple set collection, and scoring powers.

The game has some fiddly issues about positioning/aftermath of destruction and often players will need to consult an online FAQ or make a judgement call.

Wow. WOW!  This WAY exceeded my expectations. Would never have made my short list but kids saw the Tabletop video and insisted on it. The setup is less fiddly then expected (split the meeples into different bags and recruit assistance), the game doesnt overstay its welcome (less than 30 minutes) and character cards make for -dare I say it- interesting choices to make. Less chaotic than I thought. There is actually a game here. Also you can play "take that" and attack fellow monsters, or not. This is "the" family game!

Nothing draws me into a game like pure, unadulterated fun, and Rampage has this in spades. The combination of dexterity and destruction make for a delicious gaming experience. Served as an appetizer, between courses, or dessert after a main dish, Rampage is perfect. It also makes a solid family game. Players take turns taking two actions per turn. I can move around the board by lifting my monster and flicking his “paws” disk. If I am close enough to a building, I can smash it by dropping my monster from above. I can also throw buses by flicking them from the top of my monster’s head. Finally, I can huff and puff and blow your house down by placing my chin on top of my monster’s head and physically blowing on game components. After my two actions, I can eat a number of meeples laying on the ground in my section of the board based on how much I’ve been beaten up. Crazy chaos? Yes, but players attempt to control the chaos because monsters or meeples that leave the board may cause penalties. The game is wonderfully interactive without being too mean. It’s just the right length. It has beautiful components. I really can’t say enough about it. If you enjoy the theme, weight, and interaction of King of Tokyo and also like dexterity games, this is a must-have.

This rating really reflects my partner's love of the game.  It is an enjoyable dexterity game. I enjoy the actions you can take during the game and I have fun playing.  Here's my problem: I like the special ability cards, but I'm not crazy about the take-that cards that come out at the end of the game, as they can cause huge swings in the scoring. They basically remove any reason for having a strategy during the game.

Edit:  We now play with a special power, but no characters or secret powers.  We've also adjusted the scoring (1 point per meeple, 5 bonus points if you get a full set).  This has made the game much more enjoyable for us.

RATING: 6
One the most enjoyable dexterity games I have ever played. If you do not take this game seriously and are not overly competitive the game can be a blast.

Pros: 
* Great theme - large monsters destroying a city what is not to like? Tons of fun with blondes causing "mass hysteria" and old people being "useless" - heh.
* Components are thick and well made.
* Great for causal gaming and kids will love it. (Make sure an adult puts it together though)

Cons:
* Font on cards is poor and hard to read. (This is minor but annoying)
* Cards do not have written descriptions on them and the rule book must be constantly referenced.
* The euro-scoring system is horrible but house rules take care of that. Why were you not getting points for every person you ate? Since when did large monsters care?
* I have no idea what the designers were thinking with their choice for the rename? Thankfully I obtained an original printing because I do not think I would buy "Terror in Meeple City" but "Rampage" - hell yes!
* "Wow" factor wears off after time.

*** Traded for Ticket to Ride ***

$36

I can see this game as a party crowd pleaser. The 2-player game played with fiancee is fun, but the direct confrontation is a bit too much. This game forces us to throw buses at each other when we can. I can see this game be an solid 8/10 in a 4 player game. It is a light strategy game that will be out from time to time when the crowd is right.

---- Update ----
Got a 4 player game under my belt. It surely was filled with laughter, but the game stays at a 7/10 despite from my earlier speculation that the rating will rise.

---- Update ----
This is definitely a "depends on your game group" kind of game. My family is not that kind of in your face group so this couldn't hit the table and 2-player with fiancee is just straight mean. Traded in a math trade.

RATING: 7
This is a game where you build a city of out flat cardboard planes and use meeples as support beams. Then you set your monsters loose on the city, destroying things and eating the people who get knocked out of their homes. There is a deep satisfaction that occurs when you flick your monster around and stomp on the buildings. The different goals and powers give a lot of replayability to what would otherwise be fairly repetitive, although not all these powers are balanced with each other, which is a problem. The first printing of the game does have some degree of board warping, which is a problem when movement is flick based. One of the mini-expansions came with little plastic tabs that realign the edges for you.

The general sentiment is that this is a game that you pull out a few times a year and have some fun, but overall isn't a particularly edifying game. I agree with this. You'll have fun smashing cities, but the game lacks the depth and quality that would result in multiple plays in a short period of time. GREAT for kids of all ages for sure though.

Don't play this on a long table, as the rule "the player needs to be in a chair when they perform the action" is made less feasible by the fact that there's 3 feet of table between the player in their chair and the board.

:thumbsup: Kids really like the premise of this game. But grown boys (and girl) can enjoy it just as much. The complexity is easily adjustable (e.g. don't use the special abilities).
:thumbsup: The destruction of Meeple City is a vehicle for developing tactical thinking. Wanton destruction is an inferior tactic to carefully picking the buildings to destroy, or attacking another monster, or moving to the right neighborhood to eat meeples in the color you need. It's great to see kids get better at this each time they play.
:thumbsup: The components are sturdy and stand up well to the beating they're taking.

Played this game with my 9 and 6 year old. They thoroughly enjoyed it. Not a long game and it takes a bit of time to set up. The kids don't mind doing it so it's not a big problem. It's fun to see pieces flying everywhere. I am usually not a big fan of dexterity game because the pieces are all over the board and sometime it is difficult to judge if it is a valid move. Often it is quite chaotic. However, if I ignore that part of the game, the game is just pure fun. We had lots of laughs and we didn't quite care about the final score. It's just fun knocking building or other monster down. Overall. It's a fun family game especially with kids.

Ebben a játékban 4 szörnyet alakítunk akik egymással versenyezve próbálnak megenni minél több meeplt, épületelemet és járművek hajigálásával próbálják kiverni a másik fogát. 

A tábla egy nagyon dekoratív 3 dimenziós város. A házakat több emeletnyi fa figura és karton lap alkotja. A lerombolásuk során lehet próbálkozni az elfújással, szörnyünk ráejtésével vagy egyszerűen egy jármű hozzávágásával.

Több játék megvásárlása esetén a táblák összeilleszthetők és 4-nél több játékos is tudja játszani. Van lehetőség csapatjátékra is. 

Sajnos a játék bármilyen masszív elemekből készült is, rongálódni fog.

Fun dexterity board game of destroying a city and eating people. The game is simple, and the special powers are cool. Some basic strategy and a good bit of luck (in how things fly). I don't think this is a game you can get good at, which is an appeal of most dexterity games, but this is still very fun, though not as wacky as it seems.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I was slightly underwhelmed by my first play. I have to play a few more games to form a complete opinion. It's certainly fun but seems kind of long for what it is with an overly long setup, ambiguities in the rule book, and it seemed to fizzle at the end when the buildings were mostly flattened. That said, this is just in one game - I got to play this a few times to see if this was just a fluke.

When I play a dexterity game, I think I prefer something like [b]Kaboom[/b] which is even more childish but lasts for only ten minutes and satisfies the destruction quota even more effectively.

Control giant, rampaging monsters as you throw cars and breath a hellish fire onto the terrified citizens of meeple city!  Meeples fly all around (and sometimes off!) the table as building tiles flip and spray the people in all directions.  Good, family fun!

I didn't expect to like this one as much as I did as I suspected the whole idea is more of a gimmick. Turns out, it's really neat. The set up takes some time, but still much less that a lot of heavy euros and FFG titles. The best thing about this game is the immediate and tactile nature of the theme - you don't just feel the theme in atmosphere and visuals, you can touch the theme, you can flick, blow, throw and it's in character. In other words: it's a marriage between a toy and a game and it works amazingly well. 

What drives the game part is of course the scoring (mostly about collecting meeple sets and kicking teeth out of other monsters' mouths) and the cards. Card really provide the needed variety, both in the game part (additional way to score) and the 'toy' part (usually some way to bypass dexterity restrictions).

Terror in Meeple City or Rampage, as my copy reads, is a dexterity game and just plain fun. Who couldn't enjoy flicking buses at other player's monster figures, dropping your monster onto an unsteady building of meeples, or even attempting to blow other monsters down. I love that the individual player powers and one time special ability cards add variability to the game.

as a child of the '80s and a lover of arcades, this brings me back to the rampage game of old. it's similar in theme even if it's not just like the arcade machine of the same namesake. this is a great dexterity game that i've enjoyed with kids and adults alike.

I saw the large version of Rampage being played at GenCon when I walked by the booth.  Since then, everybody has been talking about how cool the big version looked, but nobody has really talked about the actual game play.  Now I know why having played it... The game is not that good.  It's a great IDEA for a game, but this particular game just wasn't very FUN or engaging.  All of the rules minutia, exceptions, and technicalities strip the game of any excitement.  A friend asked me if the game was controlled chaos or just structured destruction?  To be honest, I think a bit more chaos would make the game more fun since right now it's TOO STRUCTURED and overly gamified.  Maybe it would be better just to play the basic version without the extra cards and stuff...

Looks and sounds like a lot of fun; I could probably sell this game to anyone. But I don't think it's as fun as it seems. Sloppy mechanics and the actions are sort of repetitive. The special abilities I saw were also disappointingly unexciting.

I only got to play with 2 players and didn't see all the abilities, but I think I'd have to be overly optimistic to expect more players or different abilities to break up the routine feeling while playing which is my main complaint

Think this would be a great game to play with a mix of kids + adults though.

RATING: 7
I'm not a fan of most dexterity games but this one is definitely my favorite, I actually quite enjoyed it a lot.

This thing is just a box of fun.  The friend in my gaming group that owns this game even said he views it more as an activity than an actual game and I think I agree with him wholeheartedly.  I had a goal from the beginning of the game that would score me bonus points but I didn't even pay much attention to it, I just had fun destroying shit.  There is so much chaos in the game you can't approach it with any kind of strategy anyway, if you do you are going to be disappointed.

I did have a great time playing this game and probably always would playing it but because it's not really so much a game and really just a fun (albeit very fun) activity that has corralled my enthusiasm for it some.  I'm just as much if not more interested in cerebral experiences from my games as just dumb, juvenile fun.  It's why most adults don't spend much time building lego cities and stomping through them.

It's nice that this exists to give us an excuse to do that still but not something I'm going to want to play all the time either.

A hilarious new dexterity game from the designer of 7 Wonders and Hanabi. Setup is a bit tedious, placing the meeples and floors, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. Dropping monsters and flicking cars is hysterical, and the abilities and goals mean it's always a little different. A great game after a heavy brain burner.

If you are going to tempt me with a dexterity game, then making it one about Kaiju is definitely the way to go!

The game has a lot of interesting decisions to make about what you are choosing to do in a turn, whether attacking, buildings, or other monsters and even the variety of attacks and hidden agendas make the game a different experience every time.

This game feels like it's trying to profit form the success of King of Tokyo (even though the game aren't alike at all!)
Sadly it just doesn't work.  Dexterity game of this kind contains lots of grey area which aren't covered by the rulebook.
The game sits in a weird place between toy and game.  Beside the wow factor of the components, the game is just not engaging.

RATING: 8
A diceless game involving dozens of meeples and loads of cardboard?  Must be one serious Euro game!  Okay, so this one is all about the fun, and it delivers (even unintentionally, what with all the double entendres of blowing businessmen, etc).  At least for the first play.  I just don't know how long the fun would last with repeat plays, since there's really not a whole lot to the actual game play (though I guess the same could be said about other great dexterity games, such as PitchCar, Hamsterrolle, Crokinole, and so on).  I guess the replayability is there to a certain extent with the way in which the players' assortments of special abilities change with each game and help to guide their strategies (if you can claim that the game has strategies!).  Rampage is beautifully produced (I particularly appreciate how the board is constructed, and that it requires some skill to maneuver around it), easy to learn, and quick to play.  It's fairly nasty and cut-throat for a lighthearted game, but it fits with the theme and setting, which are wonderfully realized in the actions of the game play.  And my first (3-player) game was won by a tooth.  Literally.  I finished 2 points behind the winner, and I had acquired the fewest teeth of the 3 of us!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

I love this game. LOVE IT! I am not sure how anyone could not have fun playing this game. Its so satisfying destroying stuff and its just so fun. I knew I would like it but I didn't think I would like it this much. 

Its got more strategy and tactics than I thought it would (although, obviously, there still isn't a lot), so it gets my brain working just enough. 

Such silly, joyous fun. If you dont have fun playing this game, you may need to stop taking life so super seriously.

Crazy stupid fun. Blow stuff over, throw stuff around. The scoring at the end isn't really that important, and the gameplay outweighs the need to win.

This is a fun game I bought for my son for Crimbo (7yo).

It is great and very silly, can be pretty frustrating, requires you to be very careful not to knock stuff by accident but always brings out some laughter, usually at someone else's expense.....

Only problem we find is that my 2 youngest find it a little difficult to get their chins on their monsters to do the blow attack. Otherwise it is great, quality components and a fab variant on the flick game idea.

I love Antoine Bauza games. I'm not a long time board gamer- in fact I'm still quite new to the hobby. 7 Wonders, another Bauza game, is what got me in to the hobby. Before it I had  played quite a few non mainstream games- Catan, Betrayal at House on the Hill, even the Battlestar Galactica co-op game. Though I enjoyed all of it, 7 Wonders clicked with me like no other game had before- it was fast, simple, and surprisingly deep. I never actually owned the game as my friends have a copy with every expansion, but I rated it a 9 here anyway because, even with the base game, it's still the game I most often ask for us to play when I'm over. Antoine Bauza got me in to the hobby, and I own most of his titles now. I would even go as far to say he is my favorite designer.

With all of that said, I can easily say this is my least favorite Bauza game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as Bauza is very good at making family Euros with a somewhat unexpected amount of depth (Tokaido, Takenoko, 7 Wonders) as well as co-op games with unusual twists and mechanics behind them (Hanabi, Ghost Stories). Rampage, then, is the black sheep of Bauza games, in that it's not really that much of a game, but still has elements that try to make it a game- it has unique scoring cards kept hidden from everyone, power cards and secret power cards to use in a pinch, and a scoring phase at the end of the game. 

The problem is that all the "Euro-isms" mentioned don't gel at all with the actual game, which involves simply flicking and dropping your monster on an unsuspecting town of poor, poor meeples. You will toss vehicles at other monsters, you will put your chin on the wooden monster figure and blow meeples of their rooftops or out of their hiding places (with your "flame breath" muahahaha), and when you're done destroying everything, you'll eat some meeples (and delicious cardboard buildings) by dropping all of the loose pieces you're allowed to eat in a turn behind your monster board (in your "stomach").

The core game itself- of dropping and tossing monsters around a board- is actually very fun, though a bit messy. Keep in mind the game comes with exactly 90 meeples (no extras), and ALL 90 are needed to play the game (I will note this was for Rampage and not Terror in Meeple City; it may have spare meeples in the new version, ask around). I've yet to lose any, but do keep this in mind before purchasing. I'd hate to see someone lose a meeple and have to order replacements because their dog ate one of the businessmen that fell off the table. On top of the mess you make, you may also have to awkwardly move and get around your opponents to carry out your actions. Finally, people who are more apt at dexterity- at flicking and blowing precisely (get your mind out of the gutter)- will find this game easier to pick up than those that are less dexterous. Obviously, the owner will have the advantage of muscle memory for the motions involved having played it the most.

All of that said, it is a very fun dexterity game... scoring aside. The game gives you points for every set of EACH colored meeple you have- that is every set of 6 meeples of different colors. Did you eat 46 meeples but only 2 journalist (blue) meeples? 2 points. Did you eat 30 meeples but 5 of each color? 5 points. The issue here is that the game is more fun by smashing and eating as many meeples as you can- trying to go back to your stomach and see what colors you need where makes the game significantly more awkward to maneuver, especially with 4 players. The hidden goals also, in my opinion, add a small but unnecessary element of luck to the game. Why can't we just smash things? Why do we have to score it up in any other way than "Who ate the most meeples?" I've played it both ways and I find the latter much more entertaining. Try both and see what you prefer.

Another negative I have is that, like most Bauza, the cards involved have weird, unintuitive symbols on them instead of text- symbols that you have to look up anyway in the rulebook because each one is essentially unique. This makes using the superpowers sort of a pain even though everyone only gets essentially 2 every game. I prefer to play without them.

I like Rampage, it is fun, and very adaptable to your preferred play-style. I personally, however, could have done without the "Euro-isms". If the game had focused more on smashing and less on scoring, it would probably have fared better. As it is, the core mechanic of the game, though very very fun, doesn't match up with what I think Antoine wanted to make.

Pros:
+Decent components, including a very sturdy game board.
+It's fun to set things up, even more to smash it all to pieces.
+I like throwing vehicles at other monsters. Thank you game for letting me do this.
+Easy to learn and appealing to pretty much any age thematically.
+Good art.

Cons:
-Scoring is too Euro for this kind of game.
-No extra components (Again, Rampage version- I've no idea on Terror, which you will likely need at some point.
-Still has all the notable negatives of a Bauza game- somewhat iffy rulebook, weird symbols on cards, and, as usual, no extra components.

Rampage gets a 7 for being a fun game with misguided execution.

Rampage is a delight. It is simple and as difficult as you let it be. The dexterity element allows you to try for some rather spectacular achievements if you are daring and the chaos makes every game a frantic, colorful mess.

The game is not in the least balanced, but this is appropriate. The scoring mechanism makes it a game of savvy decisions in the midst of chaos as well as of keeping a weather eye on your opponents elevating the concept out of pure silliness into a genuine competition. However, it is decidedly silly and cannot, I feel, be enjoyed by players who aren't willing to put up with the silly, unpredictable, and unbalanced elements of the game.

There is also the odd matter of the "blondes." It is disappointing that the game felt the need to invoke gender tropes in such a mind-numbingly unnecessary way. I understand--yes, yes monster movies often have damsels. But to have the Blondes separated from the Heroes, Soldiers, Businessmen, Journalists, and Old People by gendered clothing creates some rather odd incidental meaning. At best the game is rather imprecise in it's thematic jauntiness and misses the mark with the specific nature of it's playfulness. At worst, it enshrines gender roles through physical designation of the dress-wearing meeples as nothing but damsels. Had there been a mix of dress/non-dress meeples available for all of the colors I would not be so annoyed.

In any case, it's a great game that I highly recommend but it makes a very perplexing decision with it's meeple design and I'm quite tempted to swap out the dress-wearing meeples for normal yellow meeples of the same size if I can find any.

Rampage was not on my radar. I had seen the title on some lists and categorically ignored it every time. I don't know why, it just happened. But who would pass up a chance to play the new Essen hotness? Not me!
The components and artwork for this game are very nice - and a bit - a lot - over the top. But I guess that is the whole selling point of the game, so well done. The rules are very simple of course, as is the game play. No strategy here, just some tactical moves every now and then and mostly just silly dropping of big wooden pieces, flicking of smaller wooden pieces or blowing (yes, with your mount) to knock down buildings with meeples. All good fun, but the total was less than the sum of it's parts for me. It became a bit repetitive and there wasn't as much interaction as I had hoped. It's enjoyable enough, but it's not the silly fun romp it wants - needs - to be. So I was disappointed a bit.

For the first ten minutes of a game this is probably a pretty high 8 or 9 rating. Unfortunately, the game continues for another 20-50 minutes. AND THAT IS FAR TOO LONG. Rampage is perfectly cute, but three years of playtesting and development didn't lead to interesting or balanced power cards, a sensible scoring method or a game end timer that ensures that the game ends leaving you wanting more, not less Rampage.

RATING: 3
It's not terrible, but I don't think I would find myself wanting to play it all that often.  It has a dexterity element to it, which isn't in itself bad, but it narrows the niche. 

I don't think there is much in the way of any strategy, even if you line things up and demolish in a strategically viable way, where things fly and what happens is totally chaotic.

That coupled with the bulk of the points being scored from diverse eating of meeples, where half the time, you're trying to get over to places with the meeples you want to eat lead to it not being all that much of a strategic game.

If you're wanting some light hoo haa laughing fun with your family or some kids, then it works, and is fun to play.

I'll play it with them, but would likely never bring this out with my regular game group.

It's not a game for everyone, but I'm of the opinion people who dislike this hate fun, Dexterity ≠ Luck.  I for one love crokinole style flicking games and the classic 1980s videogame rampage, so this is right up my alley.  My biggest beef with this title are artistic choices. I feel that having some variety with the monsters: A Giant Ape, Werewolf and Robot would have really solidified my interest right away harkening back to the aforementioned game of the same title.  I'm almost tempted to remake my own stickers and artwork to rectify this but sadly the card art remains the same.  Same goes for the player colour options, if they had to maintain the four lizards I would have liked to see pink, orange, green and yellow to again, invoke Hungry Hungry Hippos, it would provide a fun narrative to the teach and help the 80s nostalgia thing they went for.  The actual game art is delightful, the building sections with things like a Cash n' Guns reference or meeple tiger rugs put it over the top, it's colourful and busy really getting peoples attention.  Another issue is the board warp, having a functioning board for a game like this is the most important thing, but sadly the board warps shortly after being removed from the box making things unplayable.  I'd have given this an 8 but that's too big a manufacturing flaw to over look.

It's fast, a good 40 minutes with set up time.  Not likely going to be a title I'm going to play all the time because it would be easy to burn out on but it's going to hit the table enough to justify purchase.  I hear the board warp might go away naturally I'm interested in seeing how this turns out.

The game is decent and looks cool but the scoring system seems broken considering the randomness (such as some powers which are way better than others) and fun idea of the game. Will likely award all players 1 point for each meeple collected that is not part of a color set for more balanced end game scores. This also still leaves the harder goals in tact but doesn't completely eliminate anyone who couldn't get all the varieties.

We were pretty bad at using appropriate force in our "flicking", and often nothing went where we intended. However, it's still a fun game of destruction. 

UPDATE: After my second play I think I've probably had enough of this game already. I'm beginning to think that "destruction" games just aren't my thing.

I thought I would like Rampage more than I did because I generally like silliness and dexterity game.  But it didn't quite click with me and I can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe it was too long and there is too much downtime.  Maybe because the powers felt very unbalanced.  Maybe because it can be impossible to get a set of meeples.  I'd still play again, but I was just a little disappointed.

RATING: 5
Fun game. My only issue is that some of the cards are oviously much better or worse than others. For example, in my last game I had a power that let me double my move actions for free. I used it on almost every turn to get into a better position. One of my opponents had a power that gave them +2 teeth (can eat more meeples on a turn), which never came into effect. Similarly, the scoring cards that give points for pairs of meeples seem much better than the ones that give points for most of a certain kind.

Sold.

I was a big fan of the arcade game this is based on. Unfortunately it doesn't really feel like the same experience.

This game is intended to be silly goofy fun. And if you can enjoy that in your play, then this may be the game for you. There is a game, but I didn't find the game element to be very intriguing or particularly deep. And I didn't really feel the silly goofy fun. Everything just fell a bit flat for me. I can't imagine wanting to play this again.

About [thing=97903][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=97903][/thing] is a dexterity game in which players are monsters wanting to eat meeples, destroy buildings and brawl with each other. Not a good day to be in town. The monster that do the most damage (considering also unique goals for each player) will win. [thing=97903][/thing] includes some set collection and player powers, as each monster can have a known and always working power, and another, hidden, with a one-shot use.

As some other dexterity games, [thing=97903][/thing] has a set up that takes some work to finish, but is fun to seem everything going down.

While entertaining, [thing=97903][/thing] can drag for a bit too long - going upwards from the projected 45 minutes, entering a realm where it shouldn't go, as it work better as a 30 minutes games better. Still, with some powerful tosses of vehicles, some proper body bashing and a good breath weapon, it can end sooner and be inside where it should.

Overall, [thing=97903][/thing] fills its quota of fun, both for a younger crowd to families and game nights, as it comes with the possibility of adding special powers, or even to evolve during the course of the game, for those wanting a little more from it. Surely not the best option out there, mainly due to the set up, long play time and the bothersome need of going after stray meeples on the ground, but it still does the job well enough.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
As per the description: the buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:

a) Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.
b) Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.
c) Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.
d) Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.

Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! 

In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.

Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.

The player with the most points will be the winner.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Mostly will be where to move (or try to move) and when going for the demolish or the breathe action. The demolish tend to accomplish less destruction, but is a little more controlled when considering the meeples going out of the board (which is bad). The breathe, if you have good lungs, can do some serious damage to buildings, toss meeples far and bring down monsters, but the meeples do tend to end up in places you don't want them to go (other neighborhoods or out of the board).

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Good production value, and looks very nice on the table;
- Has a good amount of interaction between players, and the attacks, while important to reduce the ability to eat meeples of other monsters, isn't too severe;
- Special powers and superpowers for each monster make them unique;
- Allows for more decision points than one could expect from a light dexterity game, with the different ways to score;
- Small downtime between turns;
- Hidden score keeps the emotion until the finish.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- The powers (normal and super) aren't nowhere near balanced;
- Set up time and length of play can be an issue;
- Without a big table, meeples on the floor will be the norm.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Due to the 3D nature of the buildings, indeed like crushing a meeple city. So many helpless meeples trying to flee and being devoured by hungry monsters, probably in their twilight years, going in a final rampage before the end comes - this explains the choice of going after a city of meeples in an euro setting, and not ameritrash minis, as these put up a much stronger resistance; and the fact that the monsters are constantly losing their teeth. So, old and out of shape, the monster must resort to mostly fall against the buildings in order to destroy them, as the claws and kicks aren't what they used to be. The fire of the breathes already went off, but, like in a Bad Wolf deal, wind is still a strong weapon. Therefore, this isn't going to be the most glorious of attacks, but will work as a last romp between old competitors, now mostly friends, to remind them and others that once they mattered and bring forth memories of yore - much like a movie Adam Sandler and friends will do when they turn 65.

In the end, [thing=97903][/thing] does the job it sets out to do: uncompromised fun, with some emotion and expectation just before a monster is dropped or someone tries to blow away meeples and floors, couple with hidden score that keeps the tension until the end. Not a bad way to spend some time, but the "some" can drag on a little too much (more when including the set up), which can be a turn off or, at least, hurt the chances of playing constantly.

This game is light fun. I've enjoyed all but one game I played(My wife and I took it too seriously and argued the whole time.). The component quality is sketchy. The snickered pieces fall off during storage for no apparent reason, and the board warps. But a bigger problem is that the powers are totally unbalanced. You could just select powers for people to play with, but then whats the point of having a whole deck of cool powers?

Fun dexterity game that looks AMAZING and has great quality components. I used the bonus sticker sheets I got at Essen 2013 on my meeples, and they make the game look even more stunning. As for gameplay: It is a very light game, but you cannot leave your brains at home entirely. Sometimes it is better to make a little move and obtain a meeple of the kind you really want than to smack down an entire building, which may benefit your opponents. Other than that, it is very satisfying to strike down your opponents' dinosaurs with a wooden bus. My 11-year old son immediately asked for a rematch after our first game. Nuff said.

Mirroring other comments, YES, this is a casual game.  Competitive types will loathe this and you'll hate it more for playing with them.  
Overall it's a goofy mess.  Set up takes a while, there are a number of ambiguous situations that arise that aren't covered in rules, but it's really more about playing than winning and with a good group of people it can be great fun... Strongly suggest playing it EARLIER in the night when people are more sober or you will lose pieces.

This game is pretty much nonsense. I think it's supposed to be a dexterity game, but there is only so much control you can have over a stack of heavy cardboard and pile of meeples, which you are trying to strike with a heavy wooden block. Mostly it's just messy.

It's kind of bad as far as games go, but still it is pretty...and I'd be lying if I said my kids don't absolutely love knocking that city down. Maybe the game is perfect, as long as you pretend there aren't any rules?

So yeah...good toy, bad game.

Very easy to learn and great party game.  The meeple, monster, and paw tokens are all made of good quality wood...very surprised when I first opened the box.  Set up time is the biggest negative for the game as it will take several minutes to build the city.  High replay value as everyone will get into the mayhem and destruction their monstrosities will cause.  Be sure to warn new players that the very bottom floor of all the buildings (the "ruins" section) is glued to the board...you don't want mystified and angry players who flick their paws at the buildings hoping to topple them and only find their paws fly off the board with no damage for their effort.

RATING: 7.5
Its a great, silly dexterity game that brings that King of Tokyo feel to the next level.

You really need to find other players who enjoy the setup as much as the wrecking afterwards though if you really want this to hit the table often.

Otherwise, this is a setup BEFORE the group arrives type of game.

I've owned two dexterity games before Rampage: Catacombs and Ascending Empires. I quickly traded away Ascending Empires due to problems with the board and my wife's annoyance with losing her empire after being flicked at. Catacombs I got rid of because of the art and because my group was lackluster on it.

Given that, I thought Rampage might not be the best game for me: I have a track record of not liking light dexterity games. However, there are a ton of things that save it:

- Short playing time of 30 minutes
- Attacking each other, but not ruining the game
- Light theme that anyone can get into
- The sheer physical presence of a game with buildings made out of meeples

I've only played this twice, once with my game group and once with my in-laws, but I think this game is one of the few that will have to come with me on my beach vacation. It will be absolutely perfect with my family.

If you want to laugh a lot and have a fun time, pick this game up. It can make a mess when playing with meeples flying around after dropping your monster on them but who cares. Flicking the disk around the board to get close to buildings so you can attack them can be a challenge but you get better at it the more you play. Great family game, kids will love it.

Lookout! Gargantuan monsters are destroying Meeple City. Dexterity game. Board setup includes building a 3-D city scape of high rises consisting of floor tiles layered on meeple sandwiches. Monsters move through neighborhoods and destroy buildings by blowing and flicking your monster disks  eating meeples along the way.

RATING: 3.5
This can be a fun activity with the right group of people who all come in with the right mindset and mood to play this. However, I don't find it a good game at all. The powers are wildly unbalanced and there is too much opportunity to accidentally nudge something. Also, the insta-lose penalty for triggering game end can lead to a very boring, cautious, dragged-out endgame. The fun here is in the destruction and I don't enjoy that, so this is just not for me.

Excellent little game with more skill and also strategy than there might appear to be. You have to think about where to position your monster and how best to use your abilities. I think our group willingly left the board to keep teeth from opponents and get themselves to the zone they wanted to be in.

This game is called Rampage, screw your Terror in Meeple City. It is possibly one of the most fun games ever. Dexterity required, but you will have fun regardless. You play Kaiju monsters (Godzillas) to destroy a 3D ciry that actually gets destroyed. Throw buses, knock things over with your breath, and destroy building all in glorious destructive fashion. Oh yeah, ya gotta eat those people too, they're worth the big points!!

Being that I love board games based off old video games, I purchased this when it was called "Rampage" and, after scanning the rulebook and seeing no credit going to the folks at Midway, I just knew they'd have to change the title eventually, which they did. yes it's a dexerity game, but it's a dexterity game pushed as far as it can possibly go, with clever rules through in to account for all the variables that can clearly occur in a game where you slam heavy wood monsters down on a board COVERED in wooden meeples, my favoring being punished (in one of two possible ways) for meeples falling off the board, thus encouraging players to be play as skillfully as they can. And yes...you can blow on the board, which seems (and is) weird, but always a fun time watching people try to  pull of that maneuver correctly. Yes, there's some occurrences that are a little hard to suss out rulewise depending on how the pieces fall, and a few of the special powers are a little wonky, but those can all be dealt with as is. I made a last second decision to break this out at a game night where interest was flagging and it instantly saved the night. I mean, what else can you say about a game like that? Great detail on the artwork as well. Good luck flicking those buses!

Awesome and incredibly fun game!
The rating is based on a two-player game, while I think that this game should only be played with four players to completely enjoy it! With more players it can definitely go up to 8.5 or 9, but the box says 2-4 players, hence the lower rating.
This is the perfect game for a night of laughs and mayhem!
Update: played with 4 players is really a lot of cheers and fun! With four players alone, the rating would be 8.5.

A wacky, crazy dexterity game, with a theme akin to King of Tokyo. Flick your monster around the board to eat meeples and hurt the others. Not a lot of depth here, set up takes a while, and powers aren't balanced at all, but it bags of fun, looks amazing, and a great as a filler

Juego entretenido y barato, bonita presentación, buenos dibujos, coloridos y bonitos y una historia que engancha, es rapido de jugar, y con distintos niveles de dificulta, hay alguna variación por internet que alarga la vida del juego. 
Tiene un gran pero...
es cooperativo, y a no todo el mundo le gustan este tipos de juego, muchas veces para que un juego funcione tiene que tener competición, y este no la tiene.
Si te gusta hay que poner algunas normas como que a pesar de ser cooperativo nadie sea el lider, es decir siempre hay alguien que impone un poco más su forma de jugar, y al final es ese jugador el que realmente juega y el resto solo asiente y asiste a la partida.

I would say Forbidden Island is a better "gateway game" than Dominion or Pandemic, simply because it covers a lot of different aspects of gaming than just deck-building or worker placement. A person can apply theme to the game and really play up the suspense, or two or more players can see how well they can work together to get off the island. As a light and filling game, this one delivers. I'm always disappointed when a game ends in defeat, and I'm always overjoyed when a game ends in victory. Usually, at this point, we just barely win or lose - but the gameplay is almost like a dance, or like playing chess. Despite that familiarity, this game doesn't get old.

A simple to learn but enjoyable game that gets everyone working in an colaborative effort to find the treasures before the island sinks. The theme is nice. The artwork is beautiful and the bits are high quality. I have seen better quality cards but these are still very nice.

[i]tl;dr - I've found Forbidden Island to be totally replaced by its younger brother, Forbidden Desert. Highly recommend you check that one out instead.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Forbidden Island has you working together to get off of an island that's slowly sinking into the ocean. Players must work together to discover various artifacts and then race to the center to be airlifted away. 

I found this game unfun and not challenging enough. Players are contributing to their own demise by drawing the Waters Rise cards, so it adds a feeling of second-guessing and strategy that's very enjoyable.

Feels like a simplified form of Pandemic. One big difference being that the mechanics in Pandemic make more sense (except for the fact that just 4 people are saving the entire world from 4 virulent diseases out-breaking all at once). Feels like you're mostly running around the island with buckets, trying to get all the water out of places that seem far enough from the island's coast that they have no business sinking before the coastal spaces.

A very fun little cooperative game.  Shares a lot in common with Pandemic.  I prefer Pandemic's strategic depth, but when I'm in the mood for something lighter and/or quicker to set up and put away, FI fits the bill.

UPDATE: Forbidden Desert has effectively fired Forbidden Island for me.  FD does "quick, light coop game" better than FI.  The one thing I might put in FI's favor is that lucks seems to play a greater role in determining the outcome in FD.

RATING: 7
So I bought this for my mother - the reason being that is is a cooperative game, that can be played with only one person (she usually games alone) and it does not involve fighting of any kind (she doesn't like fighting or games that involve fighting.)  

So my hours of research to find a game she would like paid off.  She loves it.  She's already played it once alone, and we played it together once too.  It was a great game to play together.  I like cooperative games, and this is a comparatively easy cooperative game.  

The island sinks at a very fast rate - we barely won - if the waters rose anymore we all would have flooded.  But it was great seeing my sister save us all by taking us off the island in the helicopter, just before the place flooded.  It felt desperate up until the end.  A great game, and one I hope to play again when I visit my mom.

Fun game. I've been told it's a replayable game and it's true although not for the reasons I thought it would be. The randomized board does not add much to the replay value like it does for Settlers of Catan. The replay value comes from using your different roles each time and the randomness of the flood cards and water rise cards.

The precursor to Pandemic.  Great game for complete newbies to board games.  Even better for younger players.  The main criticism is that it's too simple and not challenging enough for more experienced players.  It's not to say that you can't lose this (especially if you play the rules correctly and discard sunken islands).  It's more like there isn't any interesting choices to make and it's fairly obvious where you should go after a couple of plays.  Pros are by the cheap price compared to more sophisticated games and lots of great looking tiles.  Unfortunately, unless you have younger players you probably won't play this much after a few games.  If you have younger players then this is well worth it.

Pandemic light but it approaches it in a better way for me, I prefer the collapse of the board instead of just adding cubes around the world. Plays quicker and seems easier to win but quite tricky of the insane setting which is the only way I will agree to play it, have almost won both games by a single turn. Feels much more intense when you feel the ground disappearing from under you than the abstract nature of "Oh no!, four cubes have gone to Atlanta we are all doomed by our cube overlords"

I don't like co-op games in general, and I REALLY don't like Matt Leacock draw-some-cards-and-see-what-awful-but-still-boring-thing-happens games.  But I think Forbidden Island is his best game for what it is.  The components are beautiful to look at, the mechanics are simple, and it's over before I hate it too much.  For me, games like Pandemic and Forbidden Desert just muck up the purest version of what is already a flawed formula.  This is another one that I don't usually play but will bring out from time to time for non-gamers.

Not a bad game.  It's Pandemic light -- very, very light.  It doesn't have the same theme, but then Euros are always ultra-light on theme, so it uses a similar mechanic.  Not nearly as challenging as Pandemic, but it takes about 1/2 long to play and 1/4th as long to set up.

+ Clever mechanic to symbolize random parts of the island becoming flooded and inaccessible.
- Doesn't hold up with repeated plays; Gets a bit boring.


Why it's previously-owned:

I traded this away for Iliad.  We usually turn to Ghost Stories whenever we feel the need for a challenging cooperative game.

Bought mainly for the fact that it has fewer and larger pieces than Pandemic so I use it as a travel version (for camping trips etc). It's objectively less good than Pandemic though and doesn't hit the table (or tent floor) very often.

RATING: 5
I don't usually like cooperative games, but this one has an elegant little ruleset and plays quickly enough that I don't mind playing it occasionally. And the steady disappearance of the tiles really lends the game some concrete physical tension that I find absent in most other co-ops.

RATING: 7
This is almost exactly like Pandemic but has fewer things going on and fewer loss conditions.  More focus on the things it does, though, which is actually kinda nice.

Great way to introduce gaming and hand management/prioritization to new or younger players, and I plan on keeping it to teach to the next generation when they come of appropriate age.

After revisiting, the game is significantly better when using alternate layouts (rather than a beefy plus, try a tower or a skull or an X), as they make decisions more meaningful.

The game works well at teaching players to identify and act upon priorities, and start to guess probabilities.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I see how this game might be just perfect for a family setting... and maybe I went into it hoping for something more interesting, but I wasn't really impressed by Forbidden Island. It has really cool components and art, the theme is neat and the game is very smooth and simple to play. Yet, having such a limited amount of options, the game is too straightforward and easy for me.

All you care about is 5 tiles in total out of 24, so you can afford to lose a lot of them... all you have to do is to stalemate the game by flipping the tiles that get hit by the water, while you search for the right cards... and it's pretty simple to do so, since - until the water hits 3 tiles per turn - you can easily flip (almost) all of them back. When you have the right cards, you can take the artifact at the cost of losing a few tiles, but they are still so many that I can hardly see how this could be a big deal. There's only two ways this game can beat you: bad luck placing the tiles at the beginning or bad luck drawing cards during the game... and I don't like this!

Forbidden Island may be good for family and young players, but I think I would rather choose other co-ops over this one for those settings. The game is not bad... just it didn't grab me and it disappointed me a little, considering how hyped up it used to be.

I bought this for my daughter; she didn't really go for Pandemic, but this time around both theme and production values hit a bullseye.  I'm not sure there will be many plays in the game, but then I had that concern about Pandemic as well (and was proven wrong).  This one is clearly lighter, but it has considerable charm and is by no means trivial.
Update: Quite a few games in, Forbidden Island is still a lot of fun.  It works very well with my four year old son in the mix as one of the team.

This is a nice game, despite the fact that the tin is very difficult to put on my shelf. What an awkward shape! I think a description of Forbidden Island as Pandemic Lite is very accurate, but it certainly provides fun for all ages. It may appeal more to mores serious gamers when raising the water level to begin, however it's fun in general. Some land masses quickly become inconsequential if they aren't connected to something you need, but overall it's a fun, well constructed game. Not something I'd play every week, but something I certainly wouldn't complain to see on the table.

The tiles look great.  Unfortunately, this is not a new really cool co-op.  It's a "kid's version of Pandemic" -- there are differences, but essentially they all amount to reducing the complexity of Pandemic.  It's much less a "gamer's game" than Pandemic, and probably at the point where 'rich decisions' are too few to hold interest for long.  Perhaps if the tiles were more differentiated that wouldn't be true (imagine if the Observatory let you, I don't know, look at the next few flood cards, so you wanted it not to sink for reasons other than mere math of the deck), but I'm not sure.  Buyer beware -- might be good for kids, and certainly playable, but it's not a "quick Pandemic."  It is a _kid's_ Pandemic.

Definitely keeping this one.

An easier, faster and cheaper version of Pandemic. Certainly not a knock against Pandemic but I know it's a bit much usually for my young kids. This game is right up their alley though. I love the great artwork as well. Sort of reminds me of a lot of the neat images from Myst.

My rating for Forbidden Island has just plummeted from 8.5 to 6.9! My opinions about the game have not changed at all: so why the major drop in my rating? Because I have just discovered the joys of Forbidden Desert. I think about the only times I would want to play Forbidden Island now would be those occasions when Forbidden Desert was not an option!

Two very similar games; but Forbidden Desert is the vastly superior of the two games! The only strong point which Island has over Desert is the spiffy disappearing island mechanic.

I don't think it would be unfair to call this game Pandemic for Kids, as it's the same designer and the same core mechanics, but with everything simplified a bit and the theme changed to be more kid-friendly (I assume kids would rather be treasure hunters exploring island ruins than be the CDC trying to prevent biological Armageddon).

If kid-friendly was a priority for me, I'd probably rate this game more favorably, but I don't have kids, and I don't play with kids, so I'd rather just play Pandemic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Almost the same mechanics as [thing=30549][/thing], but boring.  We played two games back to back and there was no stress and no challenge in defeating the game.

From my opinion the game itself is flawed from the fact that the "Waters Rise" card locations are not controlled in the Treasure deck.  If they do not come until late in the game it becomes very easy to have most of the treasures in hand before the first bad card shows up.

I doubt this will be played again.  Pandemic is a masterpiece, this is crap.  I'm almost thinking of giving this game a "broken" rating.

Forbidden Island is a co-op game, like Matt Leacock's earlier Pandemic.  And it recyles that clever mechanic of returning the discard pile to the top of the draw deck.  The theme of the sinking island and the ratcheting up of pressure towards the end are quite well done.  However, the game doesn't give the players a great deal to do beyond staying dry while waiting for sets of treasure cards to turn up.  The decisions in our games have been altogether too straightforward.

Artwork and production quality of Forbidden Island are both very good.  The rules are clearly written and unambiguous.

Requires a decent amount of strategy. Giving each player a unique role is a nice subtle way to enforce cooperation and planning.

Good for families, as with it being a cooperative game you don't have to worry about letting younger players win or older players steamrolling.

Overall, it's a great game for casual and younger players who want a thrilling cooperative experience. Groups of purely older players might find the game to be a bit simple eventually, however there's a nice mechanic that allows you to set the appropriate difficulty. However, remember that difficulty does not really enhance depth.

2/19/11 - 4 players tonight. We decided to start on the "normal" water level setting. We started out strong but ended up losing by letting the water level get too high. B decided it was unfair to lose that way since we can't control when we get Waters Rise cards. The only way we could have helped ourselves was to discard a bunch of useless "trophy" cards so that there wouldn't be so many waters rise cards when we reshuffled.

This is probably one of the best introductory strategy boardgames out there. It is fully co-op so there's no dirty play. The theme is very interesting. The production values are dollar for dollar some of the best out there. And its quick and easy to learn.

That being said, there's not alot of in depth strategy involved. The best move is usually fairly obvious and repeated plays of this will likely feel stale after a while. For the price though, this is hard to beat.

Mit der Familie Weihnachten 2012 gespielt (Mitspieler von 8 bis 85) sehr gutes Einsteigerspiel für Koop! Der Nichte (8) hat es sehr gut gefallen. Die Karten und die Figuren sind sehr hübsch und unterstützen die Spielatmosphäre.
Am Anfang auch noch auf Anfängerlevel überflutet worden. Dann hat sich aber doch sehr schnell ein Gefühl für das erfolgreiche Vorgehen eingestellt. Durch verschiedenen Insel Layouts und verschärften Startbedingung (höherer Startflutlevel) kann man das Spiel auch öfters spielen ohne das die Herausforderung fehlt. Ich bin mir sicher, das es sicherlich noch häufiger aus dem Regal kommt zum (Ein-)Spielen für ein Koop-Spiel und ganz sicher als Solospiel.

Beautiful production, and a fun little light game. Strikes me as being great to play with kids, and might really shine as two player. It didn't seem to have enough depth for four adult players. Still, an enjoyable little filler.

This game is very fun, and extremely easy for kids to pick up.  Cards are kept face-up, so non-reading kids can get the help they need.  Until my kids and I beat it on the highest difficulty-level this was our goto game for a nap-time gaming session.  (that golden hour when the baby was asleep so my two oldest and I could play a quick game)

This is one of my daughters favourite games but my other kids don't like it as much. This is the only co-operative game I have played so it is hard to judge. As a light introductory coop game I really like it. Good tension as the game nears its end. Great value for money!

EDIT: We now have Pandemic so not sure how much attention this game will now get.

RATING: 7.5
Still one of my favorite co-op games. Fairly quick to set-up and play. The only thing that can get annoying is flipping flooded tiles over, especially when there are pawns on them, only to flip them back over the next turn. We've modified our game to include tokens that you put on top of flooded tiles. Only downside to this is it's sometimes hard to get a full scope of the situation of the board as the underside of the tiles are easier to see than a token. It's really not that big of a deal, I'm just lazy. I wouldn't let any of what I've said deter me from recommending it to anyone, especially couples. This was the first board game I was able to get my wife to play as she's not a fan of one vs one games and it's normally just the two of us. It says 2-4 players but this can very easily be played solo if you're so inclined. Just make sure you play a couple characters or you'll find it very difficult to win.

RATING: 5.5
A tile-laying, tile-removing game, where players have variable powers to grab treasure, shore up sinking tiles, and escape the island to win the game.

The artwork is beautiful, the game extremely well-balanced, and just about every go is tense and exciting.

However, there's very few chances for strategy here -- it's pretty shallow in that regard.  And short.

Easy to teach, easy to learn, more of a children's game or gateway game; don't be expecting something deep.

RATING: 7.5
When cooperative games emerged, the trend was to develop advanced games for the gamers.  Game play increased as did complexity.  Then this game arrives on the scene.  Extremely approachable for gamers and non-gamers alike.  And able to be taught to younger players (my 4 y.o. likes this game!).  Add in game length appropriate to the game level and a fantastic price point and you get a winner.

Great family game.

I enjoyed playing this game. I played with my partner and our 5yo daughter on the easiest difficulty.

It's testament to the kind of tension this game can create when my partner dropped an f-bomb after a waters-rise card in front of our daughter, haha, oops!

When my daughter was not busy calling her mother out on her use of language she was super-fixated on getting the treasure and she really got right in to the story. Make sure you read out the scene-setting text at the beginning of the rule book to get eveyone in the mood.

Awesome looking figurines by the way - my daughter loved the crystal fire treasure and wanted to take it to school for 'News Day' - haha.

Probably not a game kids can play by themselves without a few adults to keep them on track, but if you're comfortable explaining all the options - good and bad - to the little ones AND letting them make their own choices, everyone is going to have a good time.

It's very clear that the game is by the same creator as Pandemic, but it's weaker possibly only because I played Pandemic first, but it is what it is. I feel like Pandemic is a more realized version of this game.

Game board is made up of a grid of tiles, so it's different every time.

In essence, Pandemic light, with a less dark theme (since getting stranded and drowning is much more pleasing and family-friendly then curing global diseases :) ) . Great price, great components, great game length, can be easily taught to kids, and - last but not least - can be easily upgraded with lego figures! The only reason why I knock one point down is that the gameplay can get a little bit samey, and that I miss the exploration aspect (something that Forbidden Desert successfully added in).

a faster, friendlier Pandemic.

The game has a stronger tension than pandemic.  It stays true to it's cooperative roots and plays very well.

Suffers from the same micromanagement problem as Pandemic, though.

Most important point, though...the pieces are immaculate and the presentation is dead on.  I would recommend on glitz alone.  But the compelling game play from Pandemic is there and makes this game a solid purchase.  And a bargain to boot!

A simple, neat and clever little game that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. A terrific introduction to co-op gaming and a good stepping stone to ML's other co-op game Pandemic.

First co-operative game I played with my children - we all enjoyed it, even if the 5 year old was more bothered about collecting the most treasure rather than ensuring we won the game - can get tense, doesn't take up too much time, beautifully produced and it attracted lots of attention from other families at the hotel we were staying at (which gets it a bonus from me as it prevented my wife being too cynical about my new habit). The only downside is limited replayability.

While I already see Pandemic as a very good gateway game, I must admit its lighter brother is much more non-gamer friendly: the gorgeous components and easier gameplay are a big bonus in enticing new gamers. But there's more than just that: Forbidden Island has some more tension and emotion! While the game progresses and the Island disappears from under the player's pieces' feet, you can feel the pressure pump and the tension grow!

The german edition comes in a cardboard box (no tin, sadly), and has some not-over-the-top miniatures.

This game is light, quick, easy, and gorgeous. It's a nice game to have in your collection, as anyone can understand the concept and the rules. Great to play with kids without being bored to tears as you may be with games specifically designed for them. It's small on your shelf, the art is fantastic, and it serves its purpose well; but don't buy this game expecting it to be a significant addition to your collection. You're not going to get hooked and play it every night for a month. It's good to have, but buy something else with it if you're looking for something compelling to sink your teeth into.

Initial Impression: I have to say that I was surprised after my first play of this game. The components are top-notch, with wonderfully illustrated tiles made of thick cardboard. I applaud the use of physical treasures to the game instead of cards or tokens. The gameplay is fairly simple to teach and easy to grasp. However, I was happily surprised at how quickly the game's tension and difficulty ramped up. The final rounds feel like a mad scramble to do everything that needs to be done. Luckily my daughter tells me that she enjoys the game so I suspect that we'll be getting this to the table fairly often. I'm hoping that this will serve as a gateway to more complex cooperative games.

I thought the more family friendly version of pandemic might take some of the bossiness out of my group when we played it.  I was wrong.  I think I'd really have to have the right group for this to be any fun.  The game production is beautiful for sure though.

Seven plays in with 2, 3 and 4 players each played at least twice.

This is a decent gateway cooperative game, but when it's held in comparison to Pandemic, Ghost Stories or Defenders of the Realm, it just isn't very good.  In all of the games played, starting at different levels of difficulty, I've never had the feeling of foreboding, even when I've lost.  Furthermore, at the end of the game, win or lose, I just haven't cared.  If I'm playing any game, cooperative or not, I want to care whether I've won or lost.

I've reread the rules a couple of times to ensure I wasn't missing some major part of the game, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  I'll most likely give it a few more tries, use it as a gateway cooperative game for complete non-gamers, but not reach for it for any other reason.  Even then, I'll most likely hit up Pandemic 95% of the time for reasons listed above.  

Quite disappointing.  :soblue:

[i]Posted: 7/2/10, Rated: 7[/i]

"It's [i][thing=30549]Pandemic[/thing][/i] lite!"  Yes, and no.

At first blush, [person=378]Matt Leacock[/person] didn't have to look much further than his first cooperative title for mechanics.  Let's see: multiple roles with special powers, four somethings that must be discovered by turning in matching sets of cards, and an event deck whose revealed cards are recycled each time a negative card is found.  Yep, sounds like [i][thing=30549]Pandemic[/thing][/i] but without that whole disease mess.

However, there are significant differences that lend [i]Forbidden Island[/i] its own unique identity.  The first is a modular board constructed from 24 tiles which are placed randomly.  Think [i][thing=13642]Louis XIV[/thing][/i] without the spaces.  Instead of finding cures for diseases, players are looking for four ancient artifacts.  Each artifact can only be discovered on two [-]research stations[/-] temple tiles (two for each artifact; eight temples in total).  And instead of having cities rise in infection, the island is sinking beneath the water as you go.

And here is where [i]Forbidden Island[/i] really comes into its own.  You know that whole "three cubes and then outbreak" mechanic from [i][thing=30549]Pandemic[/thing][/i]?  If you don't, then go [url=http://www.brettspielwelt.de/Spiele/Pandemie/]try it online for free[/url] on [url=http://www.brettspielwelt.de/?nation=en]BSW[/url].  [i]Now[/i].  I'll wait.  In [i]Forbidden Island[/i], it's two strikes and then you're sunk.  If you don't "shore up" the flooding, then an island tile will be removed from play after only two appearances of its card in the event deck.  More importantly, its matching card is also removed.  This means that the event deck is [i]always[/i] going to do something bad to you; No "free actions" if you've found the cure to Black, and a black city is drawn.

This simple change makes a huge difference.  The island really feels like it's sinking.  There are also new conditions for losing the game: if both Temples for a particular artifact sink before you have retrieved that artifact, then you lose.  And if your escape tile "Fools Landing" ever sinks, then you lose.  It's a mad rush to the finish, as you try to keep avenues open for your characters to use.

The last thing I want to mention is the "box."  It is actually a tin, with a plastic insert inside that stores all of the components well.  The artwork on all of the cards, tiles, and the tin is fantastic.  [i]Forbidden Island[/i] may sound like [i][thing=30549]Pandemic[/thing][/i] lite, but it does have its own character.  It doesn't offer the same amount of depth, and I ultimately question its replay value over time, which is why I didn't rate it as highly.  It looks great, is easy to teach, comes in a very attractive and portable tin, and can quickly scratch your itch for a cooperative game.

Probably the best game purchase I have ever made in terms of cost/plays ratio. My complaint was, for a time, that this was the only game my (non-gamer, but very happy to play games with me) friends wanted to play! I've already purchased this game as a gift for my younger sister, as well.
I like the theme of Pandemic better, but the game play is different enough (and the art appealing enough) in Forbidden Island that I really like having both games in my collection. We've nearly worn out the cards and also the tiles.

I was worried my wife wouldn't like this, but she sat down and gave it a shot anyway. Surprisingly, it has plans to stay in our collection long term.

Great game for introducing people to cooperative games: light and easy to explain, plays fast and is hard enough to be challenging without being frustrating.

So, this is essentially Matt Leacock simplifying Pandemic for a younger audience and giving it a more palatable (but still cool) theme. It's super light, but still challenging and enjoyable for adults. The theme is well-handled, the components cool- great for when you want a challenging co-op game that isn't so tense that you sweat bullets. Laid back, fun.

RATING: 7.25
Another first this year, this is a fun light little game, it is a tad on the easy side, but a worthy pull nonetheless. You find yourself dependent on your fellow adventurers, and its implementation is fairly straightforward if not brief. The various jobs do a good job changing tactics, and the water mechanic is indeed a welcomed piece to the puzzle. There were a few genuine tense moments in the game, but the way out was always clear and present. 

This is a solid title, that when expanded upon, will become a standout one.

Family night friendly!

Forbidden Desert's little (yet older) brother. A fun family cooperative game, the mechanisms are simple and streamlined, and it's easy to teach to just about anyone. I found a few points when we actually didn't have anything to do with some of our actions, which I didn't like. In Forbidden Desert you're always using your actions - there's always sand to be cleared, tiles to be flipped, etc. Forbidden Island was a nice first step and is certainly a good game - it's just been replaced.

The basic concept of the map being eroded as the game progresses is great, and even the mechanics of the game are ok. The actual gameplay, however, is dull and uninteresting. There are no actual choices. It's like tic-tac-toe for grown-ups. If you can see the best move, there is no point in being several players. You could just play it alone with 4 pawns. There are no decisions and no trade-offs, because no matter what the optimal move is too obvious.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A simple game but gentle family fun and I just like the vibe of the game so am happy to play it. It may be a little too simple for some folks but do try some of the more exotic layouts for the tiles, like a circular island. A really good game to introduce people to modern games. They may not have seen a co-operative game before and the idea of a map that sinks/forming a custom board is cool too. In terms of co-op for gamers, I prefer the slightly more meaty Forbidden Desert, which has a cool mechanic of sand drifting around and burying tiles deeper and deeper and a feeling that it is really in danger of literally burying you in sand.

My fave though in the family co-op stakes from Matt Leacock is Thunderbirds. Longer to play and a little bit deeper than Desert, and I have fun flying around in the crazy vehicles. May appeal to the big kid in you. Like Patchwork, it was bought to play with my son but having experienced it, I would now buy it for myself.

A very intriguing cooperative game that borrows some of the mechanisms of Pandemic, yet manages to capture its own unique feel.  The production quality of this game is amazing.  The chunky tiles have great art on them, the cards are all well laminated, and the treasure tokens are just amazing quality.  This would be a great introductory cooperative game, as the mechanisms are very simple yet the game can still be quite challenging.

I love the fact that the game is fast to set up and plays in 15 minutes to a half hour at the most.  It will really attract young people, but has enough decisions that it can entertain adults as well.  Watching the island slowly disappear under the adventurers is very cool and actually brings the theme to life.  I may enjoy other cooperative games more, but if I'm limited on time this one is a superb alternative.  And don't let the younger age range, faster play time, and simpler mechanisms fool you...this game can be a real challenge to win even on the normal difficulty level.

Liked this a lot my first play through, then it started to feel like a puzzle with a pasted on theme. The art does a lot to sell it to dme, but it will alsays be filler, and I probably didn't need to buy it as a friend also owns it and I doubt I'll ever play without him.

Great gateway game to have around for non-gaming friends or family members. I'll also occasionally play it solo (control multiple pawns), but I don't find the game at all engaging or challenge unless I play on the hardest difficulty.

If I had discovered this before I had played Pandemic I'd probably appreciate it more...It's known as Pandemic-lite for a reason

A great game for playing with kids, especially when teaching teamwork and planning ahead.  Not a bad gateway game either, although there are some card draws that can end the game before it really gets going.  Looking to pick up the Artscow deck of variant island configurations to give this game more life.

Our first play was fun, but for some reason after our this play my son has not asked to play this again. Co-ops are not my thing, and perhaps it is not for the kids either. We want more interaction, and competition, between the players.

RATING: 6.5
A very simple co-op, similar to Pandemic but even simpler. It has to be said, I wasn't particularly turned on by this one, it seemed very easy at novice and normal levels and is so simple that the randomness just shines through. For example, the placement of the helicopter tile in the middle makes for a much easier game, for another, pick up all 3 'waters rise' cards early and you will struggle. Pick them up late and things will be easy.

Pandemic does this better.

Even though it is derived from Pandemic, a game I sincerely dislike, I really love Forbidden Island: likely it is because it has all I couldn’t find in its forerunner. As a matter of fact Forbidden Island is a thrilling game: the the players really need to cooperate in order to win and, even more important, nobody feels like he’s just a puppet.
While in Pandemic the diversity of roles was discriminant between a fun and a boring play, in Forbidden Island every character is helpful and has always something enthralling to do at every turn, something that looks like it’s an important or decisive move: it’s not just trying to meet with the other players and swap cards (as Pandemic requires).
Forbidden Island is quick and light-hearted enough to warrant a lot of fun: as such, it can appease every category of gamers and is a good choice even as a family game. (October 2011)

[b]Edit[/b] - After intensely playing Forbidden Island, I still enjoy it but I also think my rating is too high for a simple game such this one: thus in July 2012 I adjusted my rating, lowering it from an excessive 9 to a more fitting 8.

So, I think I like this better than Pandemic. It creates the same tension, retains virtually all of what makes Pandemic great, and strips away a lot of options that can create AP in non-gamers. That's who I would be playing this with, anyway. If I play a co-op with gamers, Im reaching for something like LotR, Andor, Ghost Stories or something similar.

This game is perfect for what it is, I just don't foresee it getting lots of repeated plays by the same people.  But for when you need an easy-to-understand, well-designed cooperative game, this is great.  My ratings reflect how often I'll play or want to play a game, so the 6 is not a knock against it, I'm just being realistic.  I think it's a great game and one that I look forward to playing with the younger kids in my family.

Forbidden Island is explicitly a retheme and simplification of Pandemic by the same designer; the game is meant to appeal to a younger audience and families. That said, this might end up hitting the table more often than Pandemic even with no youngsters around. The laying out of the tiles is quick and simple and makes for what seems to be more like a puzzle to be solved than a set of overwhelming problems to be contained. The theme likewise suggests more of a sense of adventure than a feeling of hopeless dread. Pandemic is without doubt a deeper game, but Forbidden Island might be a game that I associate more with the good mood I find myself in when I play it.

30 plays: Great little cooperative game, perfectly tuned for narrow losses and victories, which makes for a great feeling. Easy to take off the shelf, easy to set up, and great to look at. There's a real feeling of drama as the island disappears!

Always fun, but doesn't have that deeper level of satisfaction that Settlers does for me. My daughter enjoyed it at 5, but didn't really understand how to pick her moves until 10 plays in. Definitely suffers from Alpha Player syndrome, where clever players have to resist bossing everyone else around.

Wonderful visual design, though I wish at times that the different tiles actually did different things to reflect their mysterious names and artwork!

Probably the game we play most often at the moment of this writing! And a perfect gateway game for non-gamers.

Note: there is an unofficial expansion card set that is excellent.

Fits a better time slot than Pandemic while doing everything Pandemic does.  I found that Pandemic was no longer hitting the table - just too long for not enough choices.

Pandemic rethemed and made lighter/simpler. Bits are nice, game isn't.

Decisions are rather obvious - there is no angst here (unlike Pandemic where you might want to use a card for movement and to save for a cure). Tension you have in pandemic just isn't here - you can let most of the island sink with litte problem, the game feels like you are just waiting for the sets of cards to come out.

If I'd played this before Pandemic I'd have thought it was novel, as it is Pandemic does everything better, this is just dull.

Es sencillo y apto para no jugones.
Se presenta en caja metálica y con buenos componetes.

One concern, like Pandemic - or any other cooperative game, it is that dominant personalities can play the game out at the expense of weaker players (telling others what to do as opposed to playing with them).

Excellent simplified version of Pandemia which is solid solution for families who don't want to compete against the family members. Theme is fun and components great.

The only issue I have with the game is that it seems to be a bit too easy. We won the game with the hardest skill level in third game. It could have been dumb luck or there might be problems with the re-playability with the game.

EDIT:

After few plays more I have to admit that this game has a real issue with the difficulty level. Game is much too easy to be a lasting co-op.

This is a really great game to introduce to people who have not played many (or any) modern boardgames - or children. It's a co-op game and there are risks that if a strong gamer is playing they will take over.

Picked this up because I loved Pandemic.  Played it, but wasn't a fan of the mechanics or theme.  I guess saving the world from 4 (or 5) deadly diseases is a little more inticing than "escape the island with the treasure".  Hated the "sunken tiles" mechanic.

This is a fun, stripped-down reboot of Pandemic.  Pandemic is ok, but we found it too samey, and a little too abstract for our tastes.  Plus, it was pretty hard to win and was too long for what it was.  Forbidden Island solves all of those issues.  It's not something we'll play often, but it's one of the few co-ops we enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's Pandemic but smaller. I 'graduated' if you will from Forbidden Island to Pandemic. Forbidden Island has a much more beautiful theme though, and it's a wonderful game in its own right, but if you plan on taking cooperative gaming more seriously, Pandemic is the stronger choice.

RATING: 6
Nice "kid's version" of Pandemic. The rules are extremely simple and clear, the artwork and quality of the tiles and cards are amazing, and the game plays very smoothly (though it lasts a little longer than I'd like for such a simple game - as long as you don't die!).

RATING: 4
It's Pandemic Light, which is saying something since Pandemic is already a light game.  I guess Forgotten Island is meant to be a family-oriented version of Pandemic but I don't see the value in it.  The theme might be more appealing to some families, but the gameplay is so much simpler that deciding what to do on your turn is obvious because there are so few elements to deal with.  The simplicity robs the game of tension because you never have to take a risk.  Without tension, the game is boring.

This is a lighter, quicker version of Pandemic. It's a decent game for what it is, but if I'm going to play a co-op game, it's much more likely to be pandemic. I'm glad I own this game though. It's a fast way to scratch the pandemic itch if I'm short on time or playing with children in the group.

I'm not sure this game is not an eight, but I'm not sure it's not a 10 either.  I am sure this is a game everyone, theme haters included, should own.  First the price, at $10.00-$15.00 there is no defensible reason to not own it.  Skip the value meal and eat bologna for a day, BAM hours of entertainment gained.  Second the value is likely unmatched at any price.  The quality of the components (box/tray), the artwork, the whole physical package is absolutely stunning.  Aside from that it is challenging (at least 1/2 dozen games before we won one...) and fun to play, takes very little time to get the hang of and is probably the best intro to cooperative gaming there is.  Is it the most fun I've ever had, would I rather play it than anything else...no but again at $10.00 if I never play it again (unlikely) it has repaid me in fun.

It's true, I definitely enjoy Pandemic much more for the added nuance (i.e., complexity). But Forbidden Island is great for playing with mixed groups or with kids. Games that work well for adults and kids playing together are actually extremely rare, and good ones are rarer still. True "gateway" games that can really engage both hobbyists and non-hobbyists in the same game are similarly scarce, but Forbidden Island manages it and you can reasonably expect to convert a few people to Pandemic Legacy.

For what it's trying to do and who it's aimed at, I actually think this is a better game than Pandemic. For gamers, just go right to the highest difficulty levels, which should engage even hardened coop veterans. The many good expansions do give Pandemic much higher replayability, but Forbidden Island will clearly have broader appeal.

RATING: 8
After 2 plays:
A reimplementation and simplification of the popular co-op Pandemic by designer Matt Leacock. The theme has been changed from curing diseases to escaping a sinking island with fabulous treasure to make it more family friendly (cue Indiana Jones music), but much of the core mechanics remain: players are trying to collect sets of cards from one deck (to cure diseases/find treasures) while another deck is getting drawn from at an increasing rate to make their situation more tenuous (spreading diseases/sinking the island). While both games are marked 10-and-up, the steamlining and simplification has taken this from a game that a 10-year-old could be taught to a game that a group of motivated 10-year-olds could pick up and learn on their own.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While I really enjoy Pandemic this version just simplifies it too much for me.  It's essentially the exact same game, but stripped down and set to a slightly different feel.

The kicker for me is that there were several turns where it was in our best interest to do absolutely nothing.  If you give me three actions per turn, and I don't need any of them half the time, the tension that makes the entire game fun just flat out disappears.  Maybe it was due to a fortuitous layout, shuffle, or combination of special abilities, but we were content to let most of the island sink and were never even remotely in danger of losing, and this was on the 2nd hardest setting.  The game literally was an exercise in sitting around waiting to draw the right cards.

Overall, I'd probably think this was fun had Pandemic not come first.  As it is, I would probably only play this if I wanted a Pandemic-like game to play with kids or people that can handle very very few rules.

A perfectly acceptable children’s version of Pandemic. It brings nothing new to the system, but also lacks any sense of interest or grandeur. If I had 8-12 year old children, it would be a big hit at $16. As a grown ass man, I’m happy to pass.

This game suffers from a common issue that plagues many coop games - its only fun when you are on the edge of loosing. Any moves you propose are discussed/approved by the entire group, which makes all of the moves near perfect, but also make the game very dull. You not really in a control of your own character - the group is in control of all characters at once. After a while it becomes a situation when you can safely go out for a drink/smoke/pizza, and the group will keep managing your character to the best of its ability without any real need for your participation. And yeah you can play this game completely solo.
Art is very pretty though.

A nice cooperative game that is perfect to introduce new players to this type of game.

With over a hundred plays of Pandemic, and with Forbidden Island using the same engine, I will likely always compare the two.

Forbidden Island is simpler with fewer rules, quicker set-up, fewer in-play options, which makes it my goto game for those who rarely play board games. But, it is also swingier due to just shuffling in the water rises cards and how at some points you will end up going through the entire location deck without drawing a water rises card.

It's a very good game, I just own better coöps. With more time, Pandemic is always better. Otherwise, for the cool theme there's Escape, and for the easy rules there's Hanabi.

2-4 players

Loved this game for many game sessions, but my wife and I started to notice a trend that we would tell new players how to play when we didn4-player, and that one of us would tell the other how to play when we did 2-player. In the end, this game often feels like a 1-player game with 4 people. It suffers from the alpha dog problem that so many cooperative games have. 

Great game; a true pioneer in cooperative play. It’s mechanics are now found in many coops, although the newest coops try to break the alpha dog problem in one way or another.

The idea of this one is pretty neat, It's an island that is sinking into the ocean and you have to work together to get the artefacts that your group came for, and make it back to the helicopter before it sinks into oblivion.

I think it's better for kids than Pandemic is, but personally I like Pandemic quite a lot more. Pandemic gives me a better gaming experience as I always feel this game is too short - but that's not a bad thing as you can play this if you're in a hurry, and it's really good with non gamers and children too.

I really like this game. Originally I rated it as a 10. Over time my opinion and rating has gone down for a couple of reasons.

First, it is very much like Pandemic mechanically and while I love Pandemic, this gets a little "same-y" especially after 16 plays of Pandemic Legacy last year.

Secondly, there is a strategy where, at low player counts, you can just camp on a few tiles around the landing pad and let the rest of the island sink. You'll usually win with this strategy, but I believe this was fixed to some degree with Forbidden Desert.

Still a great game that we played as a family many, many times.

After more plays it's lost some interest. After you beat it a couple times its not as exciting. Also, sometimes you may play with a dominant player who likes to tell others what to do. That said, the game is still fun to play on occasions as a filler.

If you like co-op games, this one is fun and quick.  There is enough skill involved to allow for some strategy and planning, but the game plays differently every time due to some added randomness.  Great for playing with anywhere from 2-4 people.

RATING: 10
A perfect little co-op game for the price. Takes 20-30 minutes to play, and has adjustable levels of difficulty. I introduced my girlfriend to this game, and she loved it. 

One word of advice: if you're finding the game too easy, check out the European rules for the game. They include a number of different possible formations for the island that really increase the game's difficulty. For under $20, you can't go wrong with this game.

RATING: 7.1
In a case of improving on an original, this takes the Pandemic mechanism and simplifies down to make a family-friendly co-op game.

Easier than Pandemic and the co-op elements seem more open, while simultaneously not making it obvious who's bailing out the team (excuse the pun) or feeling like one person's taken charge.

Played this after playing Forbidden Desert. There are fiddly bits in the gameplay, such as needing to remove cards as parts of the island disappear. Overall the game feels too easy and less interesting. As with Forbidden Desert, I cannot decide if I like it or not.. with a tendency towards not since if I were to play one or the other, I would pick Desert over Island.

Pandemic-lite. It's just almost as pandemic but is much more friendly to new gamers and children because it's smaller and there are less things to do. Highly recommended for playing with a younger audience and playing with people who aren't huge board gamers. All things considered I would much rather play Pandemic to scratch that itch, but I'll play gladly play this.

Played with my 6 year old and while she started getting it by the end I still think it’s a bit beyond her which is the only way this gets played in my house. I’d rather play Ghost Fightin Treasure Hunters with her as Forbidden Island was mostly about moving and shoring up tiles with the hope of getting the right card draws each turn. Not much game here for me honestly and there are definitely more fun family games out there than this.

A couple more plays and it's slightly better. One game ended within 3 rounds the other was down to 1 draw of 2 cards and we lost both. So the game has now shown me a bit more range, and while it is harder than some of the other cooperative games my daughter likes to play, she does seem okay with losing which is good.

Forbidden Island is a nice little cooperative game. Components are well made, and seems to play well. That being said, I'm not as hyped over it as I was Pandemic. The play is interesting and keeps you on your toes. It is strange not having a board to keep track of where the cards belong. As you play they get knocked around a bit and it can sometimes be hard to tell the empty spaces. This is really not a big deal, but it does distract some from the esthetic. Overall a good little game.

Not super interesting for adults, but if you have children, I highly recommend it.

This is a great game for player interaction, everyone have a different role to play in the game and everyone has a different view on the best strategy to win as a team. Best when everyone is willing to listen to the group and come to a consensus, could get annoying if one person tries to take charge though.
There are several difficulty levels to make sure there is always a challenge. We have a lot of fun with two players, but we need to play on the harder levels, it is a lot more challenging with more people and your strategy will be completely different.
We enjoy seeing the different layouts each time, it is a fun, all be it stressful game and the components are high quality and lovely to look at

Pandemic's little brother. Pretty good little game that looks great and is well themed.  The Forbidden Island is sinking and players must co-operate to collect the four treasures, make it to the helicopter pad and escape before the island disappears into the sea.  How cool is that?! We enjoy the way the tension builds as the island starts sinking faster than your ability to stop it.  The luck factor could turn some people off, but as a family game it is great fun.

Pleasant, fun, tight co-op game, excellent design but I think I will only play this one as a gateway game or with young players. It's always enjoyable but ultimately there's not that much there. Fortunately, Leacock has given us deeper fare along these same lines, such as its follow-up Forbidden Desert, and the classic Pandemic. And Forbidden Island retains its place as an excellent, elegant and simple-yet-challenging family-friendly gateway co-op.

Though simple game play can be a virtue, this just doesn't hit home with me. I bought it because it will be a great game to play with kids - but I recognize that I'm not necessarily its intended audience.

Update: Initial play was two player and it just wasn't as interesting. But, subsequent plays with more players made for a better game. Rating upgraded to 5.

Pandemic Streamlined.  When I need a faster game, I choose this one.

Again, there is randomness, but like pandemic, I like the recycle of the sink pile to intensify the tension in the game.  I think this is an elegant solution to the randomness, though I see that some find it a cheap cop-out.  My biggest gripe is that there are some really useful roles (pilot) and some not so really useful roles.  Perhaps better balancing between roles would help the game?

Hated this game because every time I played it it seemed obvious what the best move was. When we won it felt like we would have had to make stupid moves to lose, and when we lost it felt like it wouldn't have been possible to win.

A nice "lite" version of pandemic. The game has fantastic production quality and an awesome price point for targeting families not familiar with designer games. Well done Gamewright and Matt Leacock! Having said all that I'll always choose to play Pandemic with adults if given the choice.

Don't buy this - Hugh owns it already

I would describe this game as Pandemic Light. It really feels like the same game - just more child/casual friendly.

If I was given the choice to play this or Pandemic, I would almost always pick Pandemic.

RATING: 3
In VERY vague terms it's an easier / family friendly pandemic, but why?  There are a great many games that are both easier than pandemic and fun, so why play this one?  The fun of pandemic is strategy, risk / reward, and choice.  This game has very little nuance.  This game barely needs human beings to control the actions, just look for the flooded tiles, get there in as few moves as possible, and flip them back over. Focus on flipping High Value tiles back over and not getting your dude stuck.  Done.... that's the whole game.  Just not enough there AND it just doesn't have a soul.

Forbidden Island is up for Spiel de Jahres and for good reason. This game takes coordination, planning, and forethought in order to be victorious.  This is a fantastic cooperative title that does an excellent job of increasing the pressure and desperation.  If it seems too easy, there are multiple difficulty settings, which add a significant challenge.

RATING: 7.5
Played a number of games solo (simulating 2 players). Best game that can be played solo I have played so far, and can see it is a good gateway co-op game. 

Managed to win reasonably comfortably on the novice and normal level, and managed to win three times on the elite level. Gave the legendary level a go, and the engineer and the messenger came close, but just lost one of the temples before the relic could be retrieved. The higher levels really bring the requirement to use the special power well in combination, although there is still a very large luck factor based on the order of the water level rising coming out. 

Too complex to play with my daughter just yet, but maybe in another couple of years. Will bring this one out as a good co-op gateway game in a family setting. 

27/12/14 - played this again and won on legendary level with the pilot and the engineer. Did it I first go so may have just got unlucky previously (or I wasn't using the right character combos).

This is one of the first board games I ever bought and still has some of the best artwork in my collection. I've since realized I don't really like co-ops so most of my more recent plays have been solo (playing as 4 players), but it's so quick and easy that it'll be staying in my collection. Not to mention I bought it for some absurdly low price (like $12 or something) and is responsible for me being constantly disappointed by the price of every game I've ever bought since.

RATING: 9
This is an excellent family game.  Easy enough for the kid to pick up, but with enough tactical analysis and bet-hedging to keep the adults playing and amused.  The cooperative nature of the game is perfect for the family, too, because it doesn't matter if the adults "play better" than the kids -- everyone's working together.  And we discovered by accident how easy it is to tweak the difficulty -- you can start the game with fewer (or no) already-sinking cards, you can avoid the "instant reshuffle" after the "Waters Rise" cards...  And it still ends up a fun game with cinematic tension.

Pandemic meets Raiders of the Lost Ark!  While Pandemic is a great game, it just didn't strike a chord with my kids who love to play cooperative games.  It also proved much too fiddly for my non-gamer parents.  Forbidden Island fills the gap perfectly as it distills some of the great card mechanics of Pandemic into a package that's very accessible to kids and non-gamers alike at a price point that's very palatable.  Highly recommended -- I think this will make a great birthday gift for some of my son's pals!

Pandemic Light. No more awkward card passing rules, no more snowball outbreaks, no more tricky special player powers (read: no Dispatcher), very limited special action cards (just sandbags and a helicopter lift), and a much less threathening subject in this post 9/11-world: treasure hunting.

As I write this Pandemic hasn't been out of its box in well over 18 months or so (it's been pre-empted by other titles, and not because I think it bad or because I’m done with it), but I really wouldn’t want to put Forbidden Island on the table instead as a ‘shorter Pandemic’ to satisfy the coop appetite. Although I think I understand why Matt Leacock would create this simplified edition, which is perfect for elderly children and less fanatical gaming groups, I am very respectfully going to bow out of this one. I feel it is not kind to him to award this game with this low a number; but I promise I will make up by speaking highly of this game when not-too-serious gamers are looking for an interesting new title.

Before I forget: what Forbidden Island [i]did[/i] get absolutely right, just as its predecessor Pandemic, is the lack of randomness in player actions. Everything you do as a player is going to happen as you envisaged it. It's not like Hexer von Salem or Ghost Stories or Yggdrasil where randomly occurring shit limits what happens during your actual action. Thank you for that, Matt.

Excellent simplification of Pandemic.

Really wished I had gone with Pandemic, got this idea that is was some grander, complex game. It isn't, Forbidden Island is just watered down, Forbidden Desert a step up, of the two Forbidden Desert is the better pick.

The problem with Pandemic is the MSRP and the base game isn't that much more over Forbidden Desert. Pandemic needs that In the Lab expansion to make it shine above the Forbidden series. Problem here is that is another $40 MSRP and the Lab Challenge is the only useable part, the rest expanses On the Brink, yet another $30 MSRP.

The Lab Challenge does away with the 5 card by one player collection cure, makes it a multi co-op step action. Basically makes it a little easy to collect the cards, but adds multi steps. It is a nice mechanism.

It is a shame Z-Man when it reissued the new 2013 edition of Pandemic it didn't include the Lab Challenge given the retail price and the base game needed a boost.


if you can pick up the 2013 Pandemic base game for $20, On the Brink for $25, for $45 I guess it is OK, for way less Forbidden Desert will do you.

This guy just does a lot of rehashing.

What a perfect gateway game to pull out with any group!  Well worth adding to our collection.

Components: Nice artwork on the tiles, and fun artifact pawns. The graphic design, consistent with other Gamewright titles, leaves a lot to be desired.

Experience: Very similar to Pandemic. Because the game's AI is mostly random, there is barely any opportunity for strategy. Just move around shoring up tiles and collecting cards. Not very interesting. Any tension comes from immersing myself in the theme, imagining that the island really is sinking beneath me.

Annie bought this for me in the summer of 2014 for about $8.  This is a great game!  It comes in a tin.  2-4 players, but I have enjoyed playing it solo as well.  The same designer as Pandemic, with a similar game mechanism.  I highly recommend this one.  I have lent it to Al Chant in the past.  Challenging.  There is a sequel to this game, called Forbidden Desert, but I can't justify buying it for ~$35 to get basically the same game as this one.

This is a simplified version of Pandemic with a more accessible theme. If you are looking for something different than the bigger game, you won't find it here. This one is good for a quicker game, primarily due to the reduced setup time and fewer bits to manipulate.

Great for exposing people to co-op games for the first time.  May be a bit too easily balanced, particularly for experienced players (actually a perk for a newcomer game).  Usually comes "down to the wire" but in my experience we nearly always make it.

Very light game. The Gamewright marketing text, to us anyway, comically overstates the "electrifying tension" etc. that Forbidden Island brings to the table. As gamers will recognize, this is just Pandemic with stripped-down mechanics and a different theme. It's neither a bad game nor a great game. It's a good crossover title, but I would personally almost always want to play Pandemic instead... especially with it's expansion.

My 9-year old likes this game, as do I. The bits are beautiful and the game-play is intense (for casual gamers). Our 5-year old "plays" with us, but the strategy is beyond her. Fortunately, the co-op nature of the game allows her to tag along and feel part of the team right up to the end. It makes for a fun evening activity for us all.

This game doesn't get played as much as I thought it would in our house, it is distinctly less popular with the kids than Survive (Escape from Atlantis) and Journey to the Center of the Earth. Usually, I have to cajole the kids to play this instead. I still really like it, though.

RATING: 6
This is neat, but just haven't felt the need to play it very often.  Very similar to Pandemic in feel, but somehow not as enthralling for us - although saying that, we haven't played Pandemic as much as I thought we might either.  Maybe we're just not very cooperative.  The tin is kind of a nuisance.

I enjoy this one from time to time, but it's certainly not phenomenal, unless I'm introducing someone to Pandemic or cooperative gaming in general.

I traded it off, and kinda regret that move.  I'll probably reacquire it in the future.

Forbidden Island is a light cooperative game. The players must gather four treasures and escape the island with a helicopter before it sinks. Forbidden Island is frequently compared to Pandemic and for a good reason. They are strikingly similar. If you like Pandemic you will probably like Forbidden Island as well. It is not quite as meaty of an experience as Pandemic is, but on the positive side, it is easier to teach and to learn. And it looks great.

A wonderful cooperative game where you play explorers trying to get relics from the island before it sinks into the sea.

I'm not a big fan of Pandemic--it's a game I admire for its cleverness more than I enjoy it. This is a simplified version with just as much cleverness, but with less intensity.

Most definitely Pandemic Lite; not necessarily a bad thing, but there's no escaping a "been there, done that" feeling. Pandemic fans looking for the next-great-new co-op experience won't find it here. 

Ideal if you're in the mood for something quicker than a full game of Pandemic or perhaps a game slightly less challenging. Probably the more ideal gateway co-op of the two for the non-gamer. Went over pretty well with my inlaws.

I'm not sure yet if seeing ever-disappearing island tiles evokes more panic than a global pox spreading epidemically out of control, but there's certainly tension.

Ugrading to an 8.5 because of how great a gateway game this has turned out to be.

2016:It was cheap with my employee discount and I was still pretty new to gaming, so I bought it on a whim. I have played it a total of 3 times, but I don't regret buying it, it's just a bit to easy for my tastes, although it did show me that my SO prefers co-op to competitive. 

2018: Have ended up raising the score from a 6.5 to a 7. This game is incredibly fun to play with both adults and even more so with young kids. Kids will really get into the theme of a sinking island and start to freak out! It's so much fun. The fact that its co-op allows you to play this with even pretty young kids. My son was 5 when we first played this with him and he loved it!

After 1 recorded play (many more before I started tracking plays).

It's a good gateway co-op game with a handful of interesting decisions to make as a ground.

Great for younger gamers or people looking for something more serious than Candyland or Sorry.

I really enjoy playing Forbidden Island with my family. Being a cooperative game, however, it does not work well with all types of crowds and for me it hits the table with only certain family members. Many of my family and friends tend to like the competitive nature of board games, and cooperative games just don't do it. What I love about Forbidden Island is its inexpensive prices tag, its portability, and the different roles that make the group have to approach each game with a different strategy. Overall, great game!

It's a good game, but not all I had hoped. I've played with two and three players, and while the mechanics are great, the difficulty/tension doesn't seem to quite work out in many games. Winning or losing often comes down to a card draw at the end of a game which our strategy has no apparent effect on. This is disappointing because you don't feel you could have played better somehow to overcome the issue. The solutions are usually obvious when they're available. I understand that this is the "family" version of Pandemic, in many senses, but I had hoped, based on other reviews, that it would be good for adults too. It's a clever game, but it has quickly moved to the bottom of the pile.

I played Forbidden Island before I played Pandemic or Forbidden Desert. I fell in love with it.

Excellent cooperative game with high stakes and highly customizable difficulty level, and a bit easier than Forbidden Desert. This gives off the same vibes as Pandemic, i.e. you always feel like several things are working against you and pressuring you into quickly & efficiently completing your objectives, which is the key to making a great cooperative game. The element components themselves are uniquely cool--in fact the quality of all that you get is incredible for the affordable price. The excitement, range of options, and accessibility to new players makes it one of the best cooperative games out there.

Rated as a family game, not a real gamers' game. I don't know that I would spend much time with this with my gaming friends (on that scale it's a step above filler), but I have a lot of fun with it with my family.

After my first play I had enjoyed Pandemic more than this.

However even with laying out all the tiles I find it just as easy if not easier to setup and play.

The game has just as much depth and the mechanics are very similar.

For the price, I'd recommend this over pandemic.

RATING: 7
Yep. It's Pandemic lite but still fun and quite a bit quicker. This game doesn't play out in the variety of ways that Pandemic, depending on the roles, can. You get pretty much the same experience regardless of the characters in play. Card exchange matters much more in this game than in Pandemic and, fortunately, is easier to pull off. The treasure cards in Forbidden Island are scarce enough that you won't win even at the novice level without some exchanges, whereas it's possible to win two-player Pandemic without ever exchanging cards. Anyway, at $16.00, this is a Best Buy.

I played for the first time last night with my sisters. Forbidden Island provides a solid, cooperative gaming experience.  The game is relatively easy to teach, and fairly quick to play.  I can't see myself falling in love with it—it's just not "deep" enough. But I can see myself playing it often because of all the things it does well, and for filling the co-op niche nicely.

I think this was our first cooperative game.  Very nice, simple game. Yet over half of the time it gets rather tense as we almost drown. Great art, great tiles.  I know that other games have overtaken this one (Forbidden Desert, etc.), but this is still a go-to game.  I'll always keep it in my collection.  Great for new gamers.

I'll never get tired of the thrill/frustration that comes with Waters Rising. This game mechanic is awesome and I'm hoping to pick up Forbidden Desert soon. 

Simple set-up and presentation. Forbidden Island is great for gamers on a budget. Everything fits neatly into the medium-sized tin. This game definitely started my descent into board game geekdom and I'm proud to have it in my small collection.

Forbidden Island is one of the best cooperative games on the market.  It is also one of the simplest of the cooperative games, which makes it great for introducing to people who are not familiar with the genre.

I might like this better than Pandemic (which is saying a lot).  I like that the rules are cleaner, but I'm not as big of a fan of the theme.  So I'm torn.  It'll probably take a while of playing with gamers and non-gamers before I fully decide which one is my favorite.

--EDIT--
Increased my rating from 7.5 to 8.  This game is much more fun to play with the wife and relatives than Pandemic.  Pandemic is simply one level too deep for many non-gamers.

--EDIT--
Reduced my rating to a 7.  It turns out that my wife doesn't really like it.  If I can only get this to the table with gamers, then I might as well play Pandemic.

Game plays a lot like Pandemic except the theme isn't as good.  You're basically just flipping cards to get 4 of a kind...trading w/other players...when you are on the same spot.  Then you flip the timer deck which randomizes how long you have to collect your 4 of a kinds.  I'd play it again if asked, but wouldn't seek it out.

Players cooperate to extract four treasures from an island, and escape, before the island sinks beneath the ocean.  Simple game where players take three actions - move, exchange treasure cards, extract a treasure, or "shore" up the island tile to delay its sinking.  Then, treasure cards are drawn, the island sinks a little more, and repeat over again.  Very light, delightfully presented, and totally derivative cooperative game using the do good then do evil mechanic.  This one is aimed directly at families, and for that, it works well.  Gamers should look at the meatier Pandemic (which shares a lot of common ground).

Cooperative game about gathering four treasures on a rapidly-sinking island.

Bought after seeing on Tabletop. Have really enjoyed playing, although one of the first things I did was print out the cards for the variant island layouts. Our record is currently 2-3 and have lost in two different ways so far. We lost with a flooded Fool's Landing, and we lost when the flood gauge got all the way to the top. The games we've won have seemed to be when the various temple areas are close to Fool's Landing and also when Fool's Landing comes up very late in the set of island tiles that get flooded. We've never won without the Pilot card. We've lost with the Pilot, but never won without it.

The intro co-op game, definitely a fun one. Imagine it as Pandemic-lite, or if you haven't played Pandemic, a good game where you all have to work together to get the treasures on the island before it sinks. Pretty simple to teach and setup, the biggest issue with this game is that often it turns into one or two players just telling the rest what to do. Which is not fun for those people at all.

Good price point, too.

Heard so much about this one, and Forbidden Desert. I opted for FI over FD as I'm intending to play this with my kids, so a less-harsh gaming experience is preferred.

It's often pretty clear what you need to do on your turn.

This game uses the same dynamic as Pandemic where you spend most of your time collecting colored cards and racing around trying to accomplish your mission before the world ends. Instead of a horrible virus (Pandemic) there is this island sinking and you have to collect 4 ancient treasures and make it back to the helipad before the island sinks. I used to play Survive! when I was a kid and this reminds me a little of it. But mostly, its kind of a rip off Pandemic. Still fun and totally coop, which is rare in board games.

Played at Birmingham Expo 2010.
I thought it better than Pandemic. 
The end-race to the helicopter pad was good fun, but the start game was boring.  Spiced up a little as the flooded sections started being lost. I think it would have been more exciting if there were no special powers allowing eg Pilot to move anywhere for 1 action. I suppose it would be easy to make-up and apply a different set of player-specific capabilities.  I would also have liked something more to do with the treasure cards once that treasure had been collected - eg maybe the cards are treasure + gold coins - and so when gold coins could be 'stashed' outside of the hand?  This would also let you add a bit of distinction between players to see which person actually won!

Fun co-op game. Family favorite. Gets an 8 because this game is too easy to beat. It is the opposite of forbidden desert. I have yet to play the game where our team didn't just mosey around the board collecting what we needed and just fly away without even a hint of tension. 

You will win.

Just like Forbidden Desert, it is fun, it has great game mechanics, and is a beautiful looking game. 

But who doesn't like a challenge?

First coop game I have played. I think it's ok, but there really isn't much depth to it. Everything works fine and you can tune the difficulty, but I never really found it rewarding. Because of the "meh" feeling I got from this game, it took me a long time to get Pandemic. If you are in the same situation, stop waiting and get Pandemic - it is soooo much better.

One day I WILL win this game!  So far I am 0-2 in the 2P game. 

Update: after 6 games, I FINALLY won FI in a 4p game.  Winning did nothing to change my opinion of the game.  If anything, it seemed so incredibly easy that it just pissed me off more that it took that many games to be successful.  

Perhaps it's the way we play.  We always randomize the roles at the beginning of the game and that can really make the game difficult.  

I'm not ready to completely give up on this one as it's short, easy to pick up, and will probably be a hit with my kids.

Gorgeous art, but lackluster play. I thought this would be a short pandemic, but it's just short. There isn't much tension and the game is as brutally painful as Pandemic at times, without the fun of viruses flooding the board.

A more family-oriented version of Pandemic. I played it two player, and I think the way the cards came out made it literally unsolvable (as it was impossible to hold the number of tiles we needed). I'm all for luck in coop games (I love deckbuilding coop/solo), but it just seemed so transparent here. Would not opt for this over Desert or straight up Pandemic.

Purchased new at Cool Stuff Inc. 5/29/10

Played first game 2-player and won on the Novice level.  Mystery Bob liked it and thought it was beautiful.  I was running the game and if felt like work and Pandemic-like, which unfortunately for me, is NOT a good thing.  I'll wait to rate it after playing 3-player with my daughter.

UPDATE:  Played a 2-player game with my 9-year old daughter. Novice Level.  It went quickly and we won.  She picked up the strategies pretty easily and needed very little prodding from me.  My impression has not changed/improved with this 2nd play.

7/17/10:  Played two 4-player games at my daughter's school.  Some of the children were a bit lost, but others understood quickly.  The children all LOVED it and wanted to play again.  4-player is MUCH harder to win as all the cards are drawn at least twice if not 3 times!!

Matt Leacock's design aesthetic is immediately apparent in this game. The accelerating rate of the constantly sinking island, and the various roles are streamlined from Pandemic. This streamlining makes for a much simpler game, but also feels like a major step backward. The game hinges too strongly on the timing of the 'Waters Rise' cards. A few too early, or a few too closely together can make the game unbeatable even with optimal play, which feels more frustrating that challenging. Despite all of the changes I still find Pandemic to be much more enjoyable, but if you are a Leacock fan looking for a shorter and easier experience, this is your game.

Forbidden Island is a solid game, but it's really just a lighter version of Forbidden Desert and Pandemic. Co-ops usually don't get very much play for me since they often turn into one player controlling the game. Still, it's great for introducing people to co-ops but honestly i'd rather play Forbidden Desert or Pandemic.

RATING: 5
[2 plays] I came to this game after being pretty familiar with Pandemic, and that has totally colored my viewpoint on it.  I find it next to impossible to assess Forbidden Island in a vacuum or say what I would have thought about it without Pandemic, but in comparison to Pandemic, I found it pretty underwhelming.  

Mechanically, it’s a watered-down Pandemic, and I didn’t see any need to water it down.  And the vague attempt at a theme here is pretty weak next to the gritty realism of Pandemic.  I know some people have found the real-world plague theme off-putting, but I find it interesting and productive of the tension and suspense the game needs.  In Forbidden Island, we were just some adventurers looking to harvest treasure and get off the island before it sank.  What island is this, and why is it forbidden?  Who are we and why are we here?  What are these treasures and how do we know about them?  Why don’t we have the sense to escape the island without all the treasure we came for if it’s a choice between that and perishing?  None of these questions seemed to have an answer.  

I should say, as a huge caveat to my remarks, that I have not read the rulebook to this game.  I learned it from others who knew how to play.  So it’s entirely possible that the people teaching me just left out a bunch of thematic stuff that did exist (which in my experience is an all too common occurrence).  It’s also possible that there are answers to the rules questions that came up during our session--although the experienced players did have the rulebook and were looking at it for answers.  (Of course, sometimes in the middle of playing a game, you try to look up some rule and don’t find it and give up, only to discover later when you take more time that the issue was indeed addressed somewhere else in the rules.)  I was astonished, though, at the lacunae in the rules for such a simple game.  We came across several issues that were not made clear.  

On a positive note, production standards are high (the treasures look like something from Days of Wonder!), and I thought the tile art was lovely.  

This game does share one feature with Pandemic that I dislike, which is that roles are tied to player color.  What that means for me is that if I pick by color, I’m always stuck in the same role, but if I pick by role--or, more likely, if we assign roles randomly--then I can’t be my preferred color, and may spend half the game wrongfully trying to move the green piece.

Forbidden Island is an innocuous game, and I wouldn’t hate to play it again.  However, given a choice, I would always choose Pandemic.  And if I were going to play a game the length of Forbidden Island (FI is shorter than Pandemic), I would always choose something else.

Definitely a blast to play.   I'm not sure if "Pandemic Light" is the best way to go, as it feels more like "Pandemic Left" or "Pandemic Right" ~ I'd say it's a variation on a theme, but that means different things to gamers, and theme is the biggest change here...

I suppose it is a bit easier, flipping tiles instead of adding cubes, and maybe a little easier to get the cards to get the treasure...

Then again, we did win this one (despite all signs pointing towards doom!) :D

Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.

What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.
With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.

This has to be the best value for the money in games. It has great art and a lot of high quality pieces and in a nice tin box too all for $20! Its easier and more accessable than pandemic, though the difficulty is adjustable. Anyone can play it too.  I think its pretty creative overall. Problem here might be staying power, I'm not sure there is enough depth to keep coming back to it.  Also, unless you play it where everyone makes their own decisions it can almost feel like a 1 player game if one person starts telling everyone what to do.

My wife and friend and I bought this on a whim while in a bookstore. We stayed in the cafe and played it for hours.

I recommend varying the island layout for more challenge.

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) Often called [GAMEID=30549]-lite, and accurately so. A smoother solo experience, and its streamlined rules makes it easier to teach to non-gamers, but lacking the depth and scalability of its big brother.

I understand why people like this game. It's quick, it's elegant, it offers some difficult decisions and (especially on the harder levels) it isn't necessarily an auto-win. But there isn't much here to hold my interest. Some of the characters are more useful than others, and the game becomes repetitive pretty quickly. Still, it isn't bad as a filler once in a while.

This game is easy to set up, teach and to play. The game has strong visuals, with attractive tiles and treasures. Having portions of the island disappear adds tension.

I found the game a little repetitive and light for my tastes. I tired of it quickly. As a result I would say it is a good opener or filler but is not quite as replayable as advertised.

This is the very first game I bought when I got into board games a year ago. The artwork is just stunning and I love the theme and the various pieces. What's more is that it comes in a cool tin which stacks well with Revolver 2. LOVE! Excellent components at an even more excellent price. I think we played correctly the first few times, then we put it away to play new games, and when it came out again it felt just as difficult as the first few times. Turns out we were forgetting to deal out the initial cards. Recommend that method to make it more difficult.

I would not get Pandemic if it plays just like this one. I actually LIKE this one. Why would I want something that replaces it or plays just like it? I have heavier co-ops like Dead Men Tell No Tales or Ghost Stories for more challenge when I need it. This one is great as an intro to co-ops, or if you want a lighter or quicker playing co-op. Recommend! Especially with all of the fan-made expansions to keep it fresh...

A bit too simplistic for my taste (you can easily play it solo with four characters), but a great introduction to cooperative games and also perfect for kids. Beautiful production!

RATING: 7
When playing with newcomers, I will score this an 8. When playing with folks who know how to play, it's a 7. The main reason is because (like all coops) people begin to analyze each others turns and begin to drag down the game with it.

Definitely Pandemic-Lite but different enough to make it worth owning both. Vary the island set-up to add more difficulty...

RATING: 10
This is one of my favorite games of all time.  It's simple, can be played quickly, invites teamwork, and gives a real sense of urgency with the flood mechanic.  Sure, Pandemic does the same thing only better, but the small size and transportability of this makes it just a hair nicer.  Also the theme is more easily understood by kids.  Who doesn't like adventure/exploration themes?

Unfortunately it compares to its bigger brother Pandemic, and IMO does not stand a chance against it. Just pick one of the two: this is more suitable for children and families, pandemic is more of a  gamer's game. As for me, I'll stick with Pandemic.

Yes, it's Pandemic Lite - and that's just fine.  This game's theme just might allow it to become the next "crossover" game.

Call it Pandemic Lite. Forbidden Island is by the same designer and employs the same concepts of cooperative play, racing against the clock and player specialties you can leverage to achieve victory. My 7yo son enjoys the treasure-collecting theme (he insists on holding onto all the treasures we capture) and is able to do a pretty good job at thinking through his options and is beginning to grasp how we can work together to win. As you master the game, you'll find you will nearly always win on the starter difficulty level, and it's nice that you can easily increase the challenge when you are ready.

Also check out the iOS adaptation. It's very well done.

I confess - I like co-op games.

This is a great game that can be played within 20 to 30 minutes by yourself, with another person, or even with a small group.  Quick setup.  Nice and durable components that fit into a smaller tin allowing you to easily pack it as part of your family travels.

Relatively easy concept & mechanics that allows for younger children to play and participate.  Variable difficulty setting that you can set depending on the skill level of the players.

Like several others, I consider this a lighter version of Pandemic.

It's simple, it's easy to learn and is fun.  Unfortunately once you've acquired the treasure the game is normally over in about 20 seconds.  The escape isn't very hard, even on legendary.  I feel like this game should be much "harder" and would make it more fun.

I keep re-reading the rules, thinking the two of us must be playing incorrectly.  We played all four levels and won every time, easily.  Disappointed that it doesn't seem like much challenge.  Became repetitious, with the draw of the cards dictating the play, so minimal planning was needed.

Cards are gorgeous (so is the tin)--love playing with them (rated it higher because I enjoy playing with them).  And I like the way the board sets up differently each time. Plays very fast (a fast game is a fun game).

I think this game will be relegated to playing with children starting about 6.

Pros
-simple cooperative game, easy to teach and easy to get casual players to play (more so than Forbidden Desert)
-short game, can play several times if you fail, easy setup
-decent replayability (random layout of map)
-adjustable difficulty
-different character roles (more than the maximum number of players)
-sufficient options during a turn

Cons
-prone to alpha gamer
-not very deep, what to do is usually fairly obvious
-not much to do on first turn of game (but action picks up quickly)
-very few special ability treasure cards (only sandbag and helicopter)
-low player limit (only up to 4 players)
-not a fan of the collect cards, trade cards, move to get treasure (so obviously immigrated from Pandemic)
-moderate degree of luck involved in draw 
-water rises is tied to treasure cards drawn, but locations sinking is not (e.g. you can draw a water rises card, which shuffles the locations that sink and then instantly draw the same sinking location in a previous turn and instantly die without being able to do anything).

Since I started playing Ghost Stories last September, the world of cooperative playing opened up to me, so I bought me a couple more, of which I now tried and enjoyed Forbidden Island. Though the experience is quite different from Ghost Stories (less brainburning), I originally rated it the same. Strongest points compared to Ghost Stories are the short & easy gameplay and modular board. But it's less of a challenge and becomes more repetitive after a while. After I played Pandemic, I had to lower to an 8.

Also a huge jump forward for the boys I work with, as half of them cannot handle my other games, this one worked perfectly. Strongly recommended for kids and adults.

This is only very slightly easier to learn than Pandemic (which isn't difficult itself), but is so much more fun to play with kids.  The components are absolutely top-notch.  It's so easy to fall into telling a story about the sinking island while playing, and I would say there's about as much tension as Pandemic.  While the box says 10+, many 6 or 7 year-olds I know could play this.

Juego bastante simplón que intenta evitar que cuatro personajes se hundan en una isla en la de que deben recuperar 4 tesoros.
Es cooperativo, y además deben ganar todos los jugadores o ninguno, por lo cual, se transforma en un estupendo solitario donde encarnas a 4 personajes contra el sistema, que está representado por las losetas de la isla.
Al cabo de unas cuantas partidas se hace repetitivo. Y además, es relativamente fácil de completar.

Treasure-seeking Co-op by Matt Leacock (Designer of Pandemic)

I've played this game twice and lost it twice. It may be a lighter version of a cooperative game like Pandemic, but that doesn't make it easy. I just ordered a copy because my bf and I want to make a rethemed version using the Neverending Story, one of my favorite fantasy movies.

Another game that I only really play with the kids. They, and their friends, all seem to love it and pick up the game very quickly. 

Yes, I probably prefer Pandemic, but I've had a lot of fun playing this with younger gamers and it's a great way to spend 20-30 mins with them.

I only played this once. This cooperative game has similar mechanics to Pandemic but is much simpler: purely about tactics this turn or the next (whereas Pandemic has more interesting decisions that can have ramifications many turns later). Forbidden Island is so simple that I didn't want to play a second game. I could see this being a nice game for 4-6 year olds but that's about it. If you're an older kid or adult, I would not recommend this game for a first cooperative game - Pandemic is far more interesting.

RATING: 5
Game for playing with children or by children. System yoo easy for adults as you just delegate the control of all characters to a single leader and that's all.

For children is very atractive as they must cooperate for survive and win. Is a game of thinking.

I sugest to use the different kind os islands you can find in BGG for enjoy many posibles options.

Not too much to say about this. Lightweight fun, I imagine the differing difficulty levels and layouts provide challenge for experienced players but it's hard to get too excited about them. Good theme and it's nippy and doesn't outstay its welcome but I also can't honestly think of much I'd rather play this than.

RATING: 6.7
I played Pandemic and thought it was just ok, but actually think the gorgeous components and simpler setup and complexity fit what I want out of a cooperative game.  Won't be played too often, but fills a niche and was a great value buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Very fun cooperative game. The mechanics are very straight-forward and it flows really well. The setup time is also small when compared to Pandemic.

However, after getting the hang of this game it feels like you're just standing around waiting for cards. Pandemic shares this, but I usually feel like that's lost towards the middle of the game. Forbidden Island doesn't lose it until almost the very end.

In the end I feel that this game plays much smoother than Pandemic, but it has slightly less depth and tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
When I played this with friends, we easily won on the easy mode, and then just barely lost the hard mode by a single turn. However, I already feel like I've played every game that this could possibly provide me. Best described as a more streamlined version of Pandemic.

What can be said about Forbidden Island that hasnt been said before? Its a great game to get non gamers feet wet into the world of more deluxe games. Its just simple enough to not over whelm people, but yet not so simple that it gets boring. I would for sure put this near ticket to ride on my shelf.

If you're looking at Forbidden Island, make sure you look at Forbidden Desert first - I feel it is a slightly more complex and enjoyable game.  You lose the need to hand off cards (not my favourite) and gain shifting tiles, growing stacks of sand, and the sun beating down using up your finite water supplies.

iOS: high quality app, supports true solo (although you will play multiple characters for solo)

While simpler than any of the other cooperative games by this designer, the game has the most even difficulty curve. Each other game in the trilogy the overall difficulty seems to come about from nothing but pure chance, but this one manages to be just about equally challenging each time it is played (not that poor luck cannot undermine a run).
The game suffers from the major problems with alpha gaming, so it is still hard to recommend over better cooperative titles.

RATING: 7
A light, family version of Pandemic.  The core mechanics are the same if not a bit streamlined.  I think there is sufficient difference between the two to warrant owning both.  The production values are outstanding and it is difficult to see how they could make a profit selling it at this price.  If you like co-op games (especially if you have younger gamers), this one is a must own.

PROS:
-Es un juego muy, muy bien calculado para huir de la isla en el último turno o muy cerca de él
-Permite graduar la dificultad en función de la curva de aprendizaje de cada persona
-Cada partida es diferente gracias al uso de distintos personajes y a la disposición cambiante de las losetas en el tablero (además de las formas adicionales de la isla)
-Se puede jugar en solitario
-Relación calidad/precio muy buena
-La cuna es muy buena

CONTRAS:
-El efecto líder es alto

RATING: 7.362
I think It's a game worthy of being in a collection, given that you get for a reasonable cost good quality bits and a relatively enjoyable co-op game.  However, for me, after a few plays,it just does not enamor me.  Maybe It's the 100% co-op aspect.  I probably would play instead of solitaire with a pack of cards, but when was the last time I played solitaire with a pack of cards?  Nice to have, but will probably not play unless with my young son in the future (14/6/10) - Rating 6. UPDATE: I increase this to 7 based on the fun it is as a family puzzle solving experience (July 2014).  UPDATE: One of the few pure co-ops I like, as I enjoy it as a family gaming experience (Rating 7.362, Aug 16)

Good way to bring Pandemic mechanics to the younger crowd. Too luck-driven for adult play, but probably one of the better games to actually play with kids.  They can actually handle this and have a good time!  Though it's funny (and expected) to see the dominant leader come out of the game. Fortunately, kids don't always mind being told what to do in this context and once they have a handle on the mechanics, they begin to make better decisions for themselves.

RATING: 8
Played first time last night with the parents and we loved it. Great fun, there are interesting options for choices to be made and discussed. The island really got sinking heavily after we collected the final treasure, which gave it the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark rush to escape with our lives' feeling.

The only down side is that I'm an advanced gamer and my parents aren't so familiar with the more modern games, so they were often making unhelpful choices which I would counter with more beneficial ones. The next time around I'll step back and let them drive, win or lose. That's the best way to learn!

All in all, a fantastic family game which is simple to learn and a lot of fun.

The theme is really perfect for a cooperative game, the water constantly rising has a real effect and produces a lot of excitation. Easier to understand than Pandemic or Forbidden desert. Does not mean not difficult you can increase the difficulty. You can easily enboard some non gamer with it which is not the case with the other ones. And I do not find it too simple. It's also beautiful and affordable :)

Amazing art. The artist tried to glory. Simple gameplay. I like this cooperative game. Many people do not like that it's light. This is not entirely true. The complexity can be improved, starting immediately with the high level of flooding. Or lay the island is not, as suggested in the rules, or else. There are many options. And to attract new adherents fit well :-). Many more to compare it with the Pandemic. I do not know, did not play, can not compare.

Førstehåndsindtrykket af Forbidden Island vil jeg sige var godt. Der er tale om et lækkert produceret spil, der kan anskaffes til en meget rimelig pris. Efter at have spillet det en del gange må jeg dog indrømme, at jeg finder det ret trivielt. Forlægget, Pandemic, er i mine øjne af en helt anden kvalitet og langt mere interessant. I Forbidden Island er der sjældent nogle reelle valg og da slet ikke nogen interessante. Jeg vil stadig kunne finde på at spille det med børn, men interessen har bestemt klinget af for mit vedkommende. Hertil kan i øvrigt tilføjes at det ikke er fordi jeg ikke bryder mig om samarbejdsspil, tværtimod! Konkurrencen fra andre samarbejdsspil har været benhård og det stiller naturligvis heller ikke Forbidden Island i et bedre lys.

A much lighter and less stressful Pandemic. Not a whole lot different mechanically, but a lot shorter and more accessible. The most interesting difference is the feeling of the island sinking and parts becoming completely inaccessible as things start to go poorly. The game is much more about knowing what locations are safe to let sink, and focusing on where the treasures are, and keeping your escape route opened.

This is a great one for couples and kids as Forbidden Island is a cooperative game.  The tiles and components are gorgeous, with the exception of the boring wooden player pieces.  If you have a game with more interesting figurines (certain editions of Clue work particularly well) I recommend using those instead for added ascetic appeal.  Varying difficulty levels and clever deck mechanics keep the replayability of this game rather high.

We got this game before Pandemic.  We really like the tiles used as the game board which changes it every time.  We almost always could win, which was probably a good initiation for the kids to be ready for Pandemic. The request Forbidden Island as often as Pandemic now that we have both.  Not as much of a redundancy as I thought they would be. Worth getting, plus it's such a reasonable price for such a great game!

I found this at a thrift store for $1.20.  The cards were still in shrink and all components neatly bagged.  It had clearly never been played.

I've tried Pandemic (designed by the same creator as Forbidden Island) and wasn't overly impressed.  I also tried Scotland Yard, and again, not too impressed.

This game, however, I REALLY liked.  It has some of the same elements of Pandemic (as in certain occupations and thus skill set each player can have), but what really works for this game is its simplicity.  I don't mean simplicity in the sense of making it easy, but rather simplicity that allows for easy cooperation among players.  Parts of the island ending up under water and even sinking completely into the water also adds this sense of panic and makes the game more intense to play.  Also, the components are of high quality and practical to allow for smooth game play.

Delightful kid-friendly (esp. boys!) cooperative game - functionally it's Pandemic-lite, but the change in theme & the tile "island" make for a very different experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I upped my rating a bit for this.
Yes, Pandemic has more strategy, more options, and way more variety with the On the Brink expansion.
But FI is easier to teach, is much more visually appealing, and has a much shorter set-up time and a shorter play time.
On top of that, as others have noted, the ending of FI is superior in many ways.  It is more exciting to have an island sinking than to have cities getting filled, and it is clearly superior to "GET TO DA CHOPPA" than to cure 4 diseases and be done.
I broke down and bought a copy, because it's so pretty, and so cheap.  I still prefer Pandemic, but it's a worthy addition to my collection.

Nice little game.  Pandemic-lite.  Fun to play with the kids and plays quickly.  Would be a nice filler game, but I wouldn't play it all the time as there's not a lot of depth to it.  A solid 6 though.

One of the first designer games my kids understood. It's still fun to pull it out and relax while everyone pretends to be worried about the rising waters. I wish there was another way to increase the difficulty, because the current method feels like it arbitrarily makes you rely more heavily on luck, not skill.

Acquired February 2012 from BGG Replacement Secret Santa

2012 March -- In the past month, I've played this two times and enjoyed it very much both times. The rules are simple, the play is entertaining, but easy to grasp, and the components are very nice. It is the first co-op game my wife and daughter have enjoyed, and they will be willing to play it often, it appears. It is challenging, but we have won both times (with the easiest setting). We will have to try a more difficult level soon.

2013-November:  Guess we were lucky the first two times, because our later plays have not been so easy, but we like the challenge.

Didn't like it at all at first. But now I find that it's a fun little game to play with my son.  Probably works best with just a couple people, because there really isn't that much to it, although more players makes it easier to win.  The components on this are exceptional. Love the tin, and love the treasures. That's half of what makes my son like it so much.

RATING: 8
Pandemic light - that's the best description. The graphics is a bit cartoony and fantasy-like and the pieces are great.

The gameplay is very fast but there's still some room for making important decisions and trying to out-smart the fate.

For a gamer it's not a must-have - Pandemic is definitely deeper. But for a family gamer it's one of the best cooperative games one can get. Definitely play it.

RATING: 6
An experience I'd rate 'mostly harmless'. The gameplay is simple to learn, the game flows quickly, and the components are very nice to look at, but too many of the decisions feel rather trivial. I don't mind playing it more, simply because it's quick and usually fun, but I probably won't suggest it, unless it somehow feels just right for the group.

We rarely bother with games that aren't player vs player, even if it's indirect euro style conflict...so this was a surprise.

I can see why some players don't like it...failure can be swift and sudden. Heck, you can lose the game on the very first player's turn! But the tension is great, every flood card flipped over is agonizing, and it's clear cut enough that even my five year old can follow along and has fun playing.

After one game of Forbidden Island with two players, I am rating the game at 7. This game was fun, tense, and interactive as we raced around the island trying to grab the loot before we sank beneath the waves. We made several rules mistakes that were too much to our benefit, so we started over a couple of times. We just barely lost our first game on an unlucky draw when Fool's Landing flooded and sank on the same phase of a turn (we didn't have a Sandbag card to save it). We immediately wanted to play again but were out of time.

This game was our first foray into the co-op experience. It was just wonderful, even though I had to guard against telling my husband what to do. (I have to guard against that temptation in everything we do together!) 

The components are beautifully designed and produced. However, I do not like the metal tin that contains the game because a tin can damage other game boxes around it. Also, the treasures smell bad to me. These complaints are minor, because Forbidden Island has a perfect theme for me. Although I own Pandemic, I have not played it yet and maybe never will. I just can't get past the realistically scary theme because I know how vulnerable our civilization is to plague. 

I want to try this game with my mom, who has low vision, to see if she can see the symbols well enough to tell where to go. My color-blind brother-in-law could probably play too if we substituted markers with symbols for the painted wooden pawns.

Picked this up to play with my (then) 6 y.o. She can generally plan her actions well. My 4 y.o. also like to play along; she moves pawns, draws cards, and gathers treasures, while other plan the actions for her character. It's great to be able to play a more challenging game with older children while still including younger ones.

It's unfortunately very easy to forget to draw cards from the flood deck at the end of each turn.

I found this game getting "samey" after repeated plays. Often looking at the distribution of tiles around the island at the start of the game and the first areas to flood allows for a pretty good prediction of the outcome. Nonetheless, I think the game offers very good value for family play considering it's low cost, and it can serve as a stepping stone to more advanced cooperative games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Easy to teach and easy to learn co-op game.   Work as a team to rescue the treasure and escape before the island sinks beneath the waves.  The game brilliantly builds up tension and a sense that time is running out as you scramble to uncover the treasures.  The odds are against you but the race against time can be such an adrenalin rush that winning is secondary to playing in this brilliant game.

I initially dismissed Forbidden Island. It was being described (accurately) as a simplified Pandemic. Pandemic gets regular play around here, but it's on the lighter end of our preferred range. I didn't see the need for an even lighter version. I thought, "Yeah, I can see a simplified Pandemic being a very successful product in the marketplace, but a game geek like me probably doesn't need to check it out." I was enjoying Pandemic more as it moved into [i]more complex[/i] territory with the introduction of Pandemic: On the Brink, so why bother going in the other direction?

But I was wrong. Forbidden Island creates the same kind of spark as Pandemic. The streamlining does forfeit a bit of the nuance of Pandemic, but it also allows for a sharper and cleaner focus on the core elements that make the game system great. You can probably knock off two games of Forbidden Island for every one game of Pandemic. And this is a game that works very well in that more compact format. I would say that I enjoy Forbidden Island just as much as vanilla Pandemic, because I can play it with a wider variety of people. With gamers, Pandemic with the expansion is definitely the most satisfying version.

I haven't had much success introducing Pandemic to casual gamers and children. It's a light game, but it's a light game for gamers. In other words, it's no Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride; it's Dominion or 7 Wonders. Fobidden Island is a different story altogether. It's approachable in a way that Pandemic is not. It eliminates all the slightly tricky rules pertaining to outbreaks, research stations, and using the cards to travel. It also asks players to display their cards openly, which adds clarity to the game. The lack of private information also makes it abundantly clear that this game is a group puzzle - perhaps making it more vulnerable to a domineering, bossy captain who likes to order everyone around. That's a problem with any of these cooperative games, though, and the best solution is not to play this type of game with that type of personality.

I really enjoy the way that the geography of the island changes every time you play Forbidden Island. Different configurations require different approaches, and I enjoy discussing which portions of the board might be expendable. I highly recommend trying the variant island layouts, which can produce very challenging and interesting games.

An exciting little game that works well for beginners, yet is still a lot of fun for experienced gamers.  There is always a scary moment or two when you are turning over tiles, praying that you don't get more flooding.  It takes good cooperation and some clear headed decisions to win this one, along with a fair amount of luck.  It is a nice little mass market game with decent components and a low price.  It may not be quite as well done as Pandemic, but it is one of the cheapest thrills you will get at a game store.  This one should be in everybody's collection at one time or another.

My wife really enjoys this game. She likes Pandemic as well and considers this a perfect light filler when we don't have enough time to save the entire world. It's also simple to teach and plays relatively quickly. It is not nearly as intense as Pandemic, but holds enough tension to keep the game interesting and the players engaged throughout. My only complaint is the 4-player limit. I'd love to see this kind of co-op simplicity on a larger scale.

I like Forbidden Island, but rarely feel compelled to play. My daughter (4) is too young to grasp the concept, so we rarely have a chance to play as a family without her wishing to play something else. I'm also a bit tired of the Pandemic/FI/FD formula of shuffling the previously played cards to the top of the deck to create artificial "tension". The theme, ease of setup, and strong player interaction this one creates is what keeps this in my collection, but honestly, there are many other games I'd rather be playing.

Bought to play with my daughter and her friends. Not quite my taste and possibly a bit easy to win but it is evocative (love the tile names…."Cliffs of Abandon" being my favourite), is great for teaching cooperation and is the right difficulty level to avoid crushing young egos and make them lose interest, but still challenging enough to encourage group problem solving. I know my daughter's getting into it when the waters rise and she screams out "We're gonna die!!"

My first coop. I liked the theme of being stranded on this strange island, trying to find treasure and escaping alive. Unfortunately it was a little too simplistic. Often one or two players determined the 'optimal' plan, eliminating the decision making during individual turns.

In additon, the theme didn't came alive very well. Often it felt like Fobidden Island was more about draining the water then discovering the island and finding treasure. Was fun for a while but have no regrets selling this game.

Another stunning game from Matt Leacock (even if it is a scaled down and simplified Pandemic). Simple rules, simple mechanics but tons of gameplay and above all lots and lots of fun! We agreed that after 2 plays this is the only board game that has ever had us on the edge of our seats. Also this has to be the biggest bargain in boardgaming at the moment, I paid only £13.49 for a game which embarrasses the production of games that have cost me £35 and upwards. Love this game and will be playing it a whole lot more.

RATING: 7
Great design, beautiful components and an affordable price! Its layout is very clear, and there's a real sense of panic when the island starts to sink. I felt it was easy, but there are several harder difficulties to which I'll definitely give a shot.
It's surprisingly similar to Pandemic, though.

I think this might be the best game to introduce games to people who normally pull faces at the mere mention of actually playing a game. It's simple to learn, it's cooperative so as to not frustrate people who don't like to lose (hi there!), and it can be played relatively quickly. Maybe half an hour in a group with at least one player to explain game play and help others as needed.

All in all, a great game with mechanics I've grown to appreciate (damn you, shuffle the discard and put on top of the draw pile!!).

This is a really fun game.  My daughter and I played a game of it at our local shop and had a blast.  We started on novice level, and we lost the game, but just barely.  This is a great game to introduce to non-gamers, especially those who have no clue that cool co-op games exist, then you can ramp it up with them by moving on to Pandemic after you've got them hooked.  Great game!

As everyone has already said, it's Pandemic Lite. I don't know why, but it just didn't appeal to me. I guess if I feel the co-op itch, I'd rather just play Pandemic.

It's a pandemic style game where the game is working against you. You must work together with your team to prevent the island from sinking into the abyss. It's a lot of fun and I'm always down to play, but never have that random urge to play it like I do with other games.

Does not stop it from being amazing.

This game is a show case for the importance of theme. Despite of the fact that this game's rules are extremely similar to Pandemic, a game that I find very thematic and gripping, this one is basically a kid's game. It is far from bad, and it is even a great production and value for money. Still, it doesn't grip me at all. Perhaps the island layout makes too simple a graph, I don't know.

[i]initial reaction[/i]
Being a big fan of Pandemic, I didn't rush to play this game, as I felt I would be disappointed given all the "pandemic light" comparisons I had heard... however when a copy turned up at a monthly church game group I go to, I suggested we give it a try... I played with my wife, and a couple of other ladies, one of whom is completely new to our "designer games". It actually went down very well... despite the simplified mechanisms from pandemic, there was still a great deal of tension, and we only just managed to make it off the island with the 4 treasures before it sank into the sea.
I'm still not convinced by the Tin... I'd much rather it came in a standard cardboard game box (so I won't be adding it to my collection just yet)... but I would certainly play it again. It worked pretty well as a gateway co-op game too.

[i]subsequently[/i]
Well I picked this up in the end, as we saw it at a discount in a book store while we were visiting the US. My wife likes it, but personally I would still rather play Pandemic.

Great co-op game, gorgeous art. Feels like a real co-op where some cooperatives feel like they're just waiting to become competitive (which is fine! no arguments with that approach).

Simple enough I was able to teach it to my family in about 5 minutes, and good play time for a mix of ages all the way down to five. Younger players will love holding onto and playing with the treasure models.

Four years later: this is still getting plays about once a month. Fun to play, easy to teach, very pretty.

Our first 'cooperative' game and even though not high paced, keeps everybody involved to resolve the game.  This was a different kind of game play where everyone works together to beat the game so everyone is giving resources to each other and advice on which moves to make to make it off the island alive!  Very enjoyable.

Fun little boardgame that can be enjoyed way below the recommended age range. My 5 year old son picked up the mchanics of this game after only 1 play and seems to enjoy it (he has asked to play it again). The only change I made to the mechanics was to remove the hand size limit of 5 cards. It's not that large of a change in my opinion, and I think it helped him grasp the other concepts quicker.

Filler cooperative game that works pretty well, using the clever card mechanic from "Pandemic" to cause areas of the board to be repeatedly affected. But it is perhaps too simplistic, and the best choices are usually obvious. Beautiful artwork and very nice plastic treasures, but it is odd that the American version has dull generic pawns for the players, replaced with painted miniatures in the German edition.

I like this take on Pandemic. The game didn't have the same sense of suspense from my first play of Pandemic; it's too easy to win on novice and normal levels. The elite and legendary are more fun to play.

Again the theme works and the game looks great, not only the art, but also how the game is set up, the effect of the tiles disappearing: it really feels like a sinking island to me.

As a family game this is not bad. I keep it because my child likes to play it with me, which is great. She would rate it an 8 or 9. This could be good for families looking for a very light cooperative game or those with younger kids. I do like the fact that it is short. I make my daughter take her own decisions and if she messes up not much is lost, and it is easy to start right back up without feeling that you have lost anything. It provides a good primer for deeper experiences. Not something I would play with my competitive gaming group.

Update: holding steady after a dozen plays. Still good for what I mentioned above but nothing more. 

Update: I am not sure why they didn't include the alternate island setups in the US manual (they were in the German), but they have made the game so much more interesting. The new setups are challenging and increase the replay value by 100 times. It is still below Forbidden Desert and Pandemic, but bumping up from 7 to 9 based on the alternate setups.

Pandemic does a number of clever things to make you forget you're just hanging around waiting for the cards you need to cure something; Forbidden Island lacks these things. As such, you just hang around waiting for the cards you need.
That said, the sinking island mechanic is perhaps marginally better than Pandemic's cube spread--so there is something nifty. That, and the incredibly gorgeous components.

The first board game I've ever bought.  My friends and I enjoyed it immensely.  Cooperative play always goes along better in our group of newbies to board games, so it's refreshing to have a game that has us working together.  The first couple of plays were difficult as we seemed to lose a lot.  However, the more people we added and played with - the easier the game became with more brain power.  

A fun game that's easily teachable, not to mention at a fantastic price.  I believe I bought it for around $10.  A good stepping stone into the world of board games.

RATING: 7
A lighter and shorter Pandemic - IMHO, exactly what Pandemic needed, being condensed down to a shorter format that doesn't lose any core mechanics. There's no cube explosions in Forbidden Island, but it has everything else: Recurring floodings of the same tiles, increasing difficulty the longer the game progresses, individual player roles, and solution of the game by means of collaborative set collection and trading. Really neat.

RATING: 8
What a cool game! I've played with just two people and we had a heck of a time winning. When played with more it seems like it's a bit easier because you get the benefits of more "class" features. 

Love that it's so cheap, too. Simple mechanics that are made more complicated by there being numerous ways to lose the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is less complex, less fiddly and looks nicer than Pandemic; I can play it in a family environment so even though it's Pandemic lite, and much less of a challenge, both feel quite different.
The problem is that the only difficulty that matters is the harder, "legendary", difficulty; then if you are a little unlucky you'll loose.  Otherwise, well, the game is too easy.

Greatly enhanced by the variable setups (found in the german version or here on BGG in the files section)

Fun game, perfect as a cooperative family game. 

Graphis are stunning. Tense game, where you fight an uphill battle to collect the treasures before the island is flooded and sinks into the ocean. Quick playtime, tons of replayabilitity and a very social game for the more casual gamer. Strongly recommended a family game.

Its a fun and fast co-cop, but its too easy.  There is not much challenge here.  Losing seems to be only a case of when the universe is aligned against the players.  In the grand scheme it feels like so much more could of been done such as giving each tile a special purpose and giving the waters rise a little more bite.  Definitely needs sharks.

With that said it is great for younger players and we are enable to have our 5 year old son play alongside us and take the basic actions each turn.  It turns into a great matching game for him when the tiles need to be sunk.

In my opinion the quintessential gateway game for co-ops. Simplistic enough that no one should feel intimidated by playing it. Easy to learn yet diverse rules and special abilities to make the game interesting with replay value. An excellent stepping stone to see if you are interested in more complex co-ops like Forbidden Desert or Pandemic. Varying difficulty setting offer more challenges. Beautiful components and a ton of value for what the game costs

Rather for kids & teens. Very nice artwork, components not as stunning as forbidden desert though. For gamers this is rather forgettable. The mechanics feel very mathematical.. my mind won't hold on to any theme & instead just start calculating.. these tiles we need.. so this is the path we need to keep free.. this action is more efficient done then etc.
But i don't enjoy any co-op game, so take this with a grain of salt :)

Great co-op family game. I love playing this game with my very smart seven and nine year old boys. My oldest was upset when we escaped the island because he wanted to continue to save it. So he'd agree to leave, I told him that once we leave the island it didn't sink.

Good gateway co-op game. It's more difficult than it's predecessor Forbidden Island. This is mostly because the "Desert winds" mechanics is more random than the "Flooding" mechanic. I would recommend Forbidden Island instead of Forbidden desert.

Interesting aspect of the game that the game boards are vanishing over time. You will have limited options turn after turn but these options are more important to do. The game feels like Pandemic which i believe is a better game over all. I will play this one if im asked to it is fun to play. However because of Pandemic i don't believe that i will buy this one.

Pros:
-Interesting aspect of vanishing boards.
-Easy to learn and sometimes interesting choices to make.

-Pandemic is a better game, so with that in my collection i don't buy this much easier one.

A sweet little coop game, with similar mechanics to Pandemic (moving critical locations to the top of the draw deck for redraw) and a lot of tension for a 'children's game.'

This game is a good buy for the price (I picked a copy up for a cool $15 and I've seen it as low as $11 in a grocery store... of all places). After multiple plays the game loses it's luster, however, and I only really play it nowadays with people that have never tried it. It's easy to learn and quick to play. I have also found myself fantasizing about rule deviations, to spice the game up. 

For example: The island is basically a 6x6 grid with the four corners missing. To add a bit of randomness to the game: (1) between each player's turn roll 2 six-sided dice, where one die represents rows and the other columns; (2) Find the island tile that is represented by the roll; (3) roll 2 six-sided dice again and locate the another tile; (4) SWAP the tiles. The island now becomes a mystical teleporting-tile island.

Addition (7/22/13): The shifting tiles idea I explain here is incorporated in Forbidden Desert. No, they probably did not get the idea after reading my review, but I swear I didn't know about this game until today.

Very similar to Pandemic in mechanisms, but devoid of any atmosphere. The pieces seem randomly assembled - I was really disappointed, because I like the cover art a lot.

An excelent cooperative game. It can turn a bit difficult to keep all the winning conditions but it's not impossible. I like the idea where there are many ways to lose and a single way to win, it definitely makes it a challenge.

Excelente juego cooperativo. Puede volverse un poco complicado mantener todas las condiciones para ganar mas no es imposible. Me gusta la idea de que existan más formas de perder que de ganar, lo hace un buen reto.

Pretty much the same as forbidden desert but subtle changes.  Teh game is easy to learn for young kids but dont take it as a kid game only.  It does require the team work together but the rules are much simpler than many co-op.  And for that, I like it and its a great game for learning co-op games.  
I took this to a play with a group of young teens and watched them all scatter around the map, playing their own game, and quite efficiently dying.  Very enjoyable to watch the aftermath as they all placed the blame on each other.  If I were a manager of a fast-food joint this game would be part of my interview process.   
The game components are nice and well constructed.  The bits are attractive and overproduced for the simplicity of the game but makes finding them almost worth it wherein simple tokens might strain some of this joy.  The art is really good as well,

Wow! This is a really great game!

I mean, yeah, it's based off of Pandemic, so some folks say you don't need both; but I don't know about that. Though the mechanics are much alike, the experience is a lot different.

The smaller number of areas in play means a small Flood deck which turns over quickly, so every tile is going to be threatened; there are no safe spots, or areas that you can really afford to lose. if you let a few tiles go, the deck is smaller, and the tiles left are going to be threatened even more. The tension as parts of the island are flooded and fall into the sea is delicious!

Right at this moment, I'm prepared to say that I actually like Forbidden Island more than Pandemic! It plays quicker, and delivers as much cooperative fun as its big brother.

EDIT! Having played both some more, I'm prepared to say that I was full of it, here. Pandemic is definitely better. But FI is still a great game.

Many reviews compare Forbidden Island and Forbidden Desert and crown "Desert" as the better game. While I do think "Desert" is more challenging overall, "Island" is a great game in its own right. The sinking dynamic with permanent land-loss is very different from the piling up of moving desert tiles; I think if you like one, you'll enjoy the other. And at their low price points, are worth purchasing. Great artwork; an easy co-op that is fun for those new to such gaming.

A Forbidden Desert version for families, works with kids as well and maybe that`s the selling point here.

I have gotten more into cooperative games as of late, and I found this one very enjoyable.  I thought that it would be harder since watching Tabletop get destroyed by it, and what other people have said.  But, I like it a lot anyway.  It is a fun way to pass about 30 minutes.  Just watch out for table captains that will basically tell you your play, and run the whole game alone.

One of the best games as far as quality components and well thought out storage goes. The island cards are thick, sturdy cardboard stock and the plastic treasure tokens are a unique and wonderful touch. The tin has an organizer insert and everything has a place. I wish more game designers put as much thought into the game packaging as Gamewright did with this game!
I had a lot of fun playing the game, but eventually tired of it and gave it to my nephews. One nephew (5 at the time) understood it right away, but his older brother struggled a bit - depends on the kid, I guess. Regardless, I think this is a perfect game for kids (I'd estimate ages 9-11) and best suited to them. It seemed a tad juvenile and rote after a few plays with only adults.

Matt Leacock has borrowed significantly from his Pandemic design (player special powers, cards replaced on top of the draw deck), but removed most of the character that made the original appealing. A short game by the standards of most co-ops, but fiendishly difficult to win, even on the novice level. Streamlining games seems to be a risky prospect (see Brass/Age of Industry for another example), this does nothing to improve my opinion.

[b]ONE OF THE OLDEST TALES OF HOW MAN BRAVES THE ELEMENTS TO FIND SOME OLD TREASURES AND THEN RUN THE HELL OUT OF WHEREVER THE ELEMENTS MIGHT TRY AND KILL HIM AND HIS KIND[/b]

Without a doubt, one of the best games I have ever played. It has almost all the elements worth looking for in a game of this kind: Artistic value, good quality components, a smooth turn system, lots of strategy, a highly intelligent and unpredictable enemy, and very limited choices for the players once things start to crumble and fall. The only thing that it might be missing in this game is the possibility of winning alone, in case you’re actually the last one to survive. But that’s really not a necessity, since the game is already a masterpiece without it having to be like all other co-op games.

The game pits two to four players in an island that’s slowly starting to sink in the ocean. The players must find four different treasures, each representing one of the four classical elements, and each of them beautifully sculpted in resin or transparent plastic. For all things important in the game, from making sure everyone moves correctly and safely through the island tiles to getting the treasures safely from the receptive places, the characters count not only with cards that allow them to obtain the treasures, but also with their own particular ability.

As a consequence of the above mentioned things, a delicate strategy plan must be carefully planned before each turn, because the actions of each player can make thing easier for the others. Distance, movement, routes between point A and point B are also to be taken into account, since the unpredictability of the tiles sinking or disappearing beneath the waves is the danger everyone has to face. 

Mr. Leacock created an impressive co-operative game that focuses not on the action and suspense of the game and settings themselves, but on how the players react to each other and to their surroundings, making The Forbidden Island a completely new kind of game. Players have a shared goal, they must make sure the others survive and also, make sure the island doesn’t sink before they can get the treasures.

This game will definitely see a lot of gameplay in the future, and I don’t think it will ever stop being a top choice for me and my friends.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]_____[COLOR=#FF0000][6][/COLOR]____[/b] Themed: This game may very well be called “The Building on Fire”, but the them itself is not very interesting. I have heard that Mr. Leacock’s “Pandemic” is pretty much the same game, with a different them and a different level of tension and stress, with a few additions here and there. Theme for this game is not a very defining element, but it’s a lot more interesting t have the players flee an island sinking in the ocean than a trying to escape a building on fire or other like places or situations.

Simple [b]______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] Complex: Strategic thinking, taking into account locations and probabilities, and combining those things with the randomness and unpredictability of the draw decks make The Forbidden Island a very complex game. Under no circumstances should it be seen as a filler or as a party game, or as a fast game for children. Every game will be different and despite the fact that players can be experienced “survivors”, the island is a lot smarter and faster..

Strategic [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Tactical: The Island shifts with every turn, and positions may be lost or won. Strategies may be present and may last all the game, but this will never be strong enough or smart enough to make sure they carry out their purposes. Tactical thinking is a better path for players, at least in the most important areas of the game, for example, which players should get the treasures and which players should be those transporting people, cards or making sure the island stays afloat long enough for the players to reach the helicopter and flee. 
 
Luck [b]___[COLOR=#FF0000][4][/COLOR]______[/b] Skill: Despite the fact that everything about this game points to the players’ abilities and personal resolution of the players, the game is essentially a race against time, and against a board that is both highly intelligent and incredibly fast. Sometimes players will win the game with little to no effort, but sometimes, they won’t be that lucky .

Fiddly [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Elegant: It took me and three other friends two game sessions with the rulebook opened to learn the “dos and don’ts” of the game, and how the island worked out against us. The rules are clear about how the cards work and the staggering lack of text in almost all cards is always a plus for a game that is meant to be played with a fast pace and without may nuisance and irrelevant matters. The rulebook, though short and small, is easily the most precise rule book I’ve read.
 
Indirect interaction [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Direct interaction: Team-work is an obvious necessity in the Island, because whatever ability one character has, it will affect the other one, so the players are meant to work together and make their specialties as effective as they can be.

Cutthroat [b]__________[/b] Friendly: As a cooperative game without a player taking the part of the bad guy (As in Middle-Earth Quest or Letters From Whitechapel), The Forbidden Island is not a game that could be seen as cutthroat or friendly, since the only possibility of winning the game results in the whole party surviving. Behaving like an idiot, trying to survive alone or just not helping the others or not listening to them when it’s important will result in this game not only being a complete failure, but also a burden and a poor choice when deciding what to play. It is recommended that this game should not be played with competitive players or people new to the gaming group..

Heavy use of language [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] No language needed: Along the game, there are exactly three kind of cards that use text and watch one of them, after a few times of seeing them act, end up being just another card with symbols on them, so the players eventually never end up reading them. Sometimes, players may forget what they do exactly, but that’s almost never the case.

[b][i]III. Number of players recommended[/i][/b]: 4.

RATING: 8
Brilliant game to play with children/family. It's like a simpler version of Pandemic which is makes it perfect as an intro to coops.

It's quickly become one of my daughter's favourite games so that's partly how I'm rating it. For gamers the decisions are a bit too simple so I'd go with Pandemic or another coop.

Forbidden Island, aka, Pandemic light. Coming from the same designer as Pandemic, you'll really get the same experience. But this is a much easier game. It's the coop I bring out if I'm teaching younger players a new game.

I really like the theme here. Explorers coming to a mysterious island, looking for four ancient artifacts of immense power. And as soon as they touch down...the island sense their presence and starts sinking! It's a race to shore up tiles that are sinking, saving one another, gathering the artifacts, and getting out TOGETHER! If one dies...you all loose.

The components in this game are phenomenal. Thick cardboard tiles that form the island. The Artifacts are actually sculpted and designed in such a way that it makes you want to get them. The different characters are just represented with pawns, so it would have been nice to have minis that looked like who they were supposed to be (i.e. Pilot, Diver, Engineer, Adventurer, ect.)

One of my first board games that I tried that wasn't from the Hasbro family of my youth.  Forbidden Island really opened my eyes to how different board games could be.  It also helped me quickly pick up Pandemic, as well, since they both utilize mechanics from the same designer.  In that way, it also helped me start to identify authorial stamps from individual designers.

A fun co-op game, with similar mechanics to Pandemic, albeit simplified. Games play out fairly quickly, and was able to introduce my three year old daughter to the game, who is able to understand the concept, but not yet the mechanics. Does feel a bit too simplified when compared to Pandemic, but the theme, easier set up and shorter game time makes for an enjoyable, and somewhat less "intense" game.

Great intro game especially with younger ones in the family. Gameplay is easy to teach and quick for people to start playing strategically. Beware of dictator gamers for this one tho, they can ruin the gameplay session by ordering everyone around. 

Components are top notch for such a low price point. Only reason why this is a 8 is because I would prefer playing Pandemic over this anytime as a gamer. But I wouldn't turn this down for gameplay if anyone suggested it.

After an initial 4P play, I have good feelings about this purchase. Certainly the tension and excitement were high as we all learned the game together. Terrific artwork and sturdy components, the theme and design makes it easy for non-gamers to get into, which is primarily why I bought it. My wife and some friends who are turned off by more complex games seem to find this one appealing, yet I do too as a BG. I'm sure rating will increase with further plays, as the replayability for FI looks to be high.

One other note, when playing with the Diver, we replace Sunken tiles with glass beads so that it is more easy to recognize where he can use his special ability.

If you play with non-gamers and/or people who are turned off by the theme of Pandemic, Forbidden Island is worth looking at, especially at that price point. Forbidden Island has fewer special power cards in the draw deck, but I think it makes you work together more, and focus on each person's special powers. It is very similar to Pandemic, but has fun artwork and an approachable theme. One of the things that held me off from Pandemic for a while was the theme. If FI had been available, that would have been a GREAT game for us, and I think it will go over well with family groups and/or couples with a spouse who wants lighter gaming. The setup is pretty minimal, the rules are pretty minimal, but it does make for a challenge. It's quick enough that you can play again, which is always good to have it "sink in". I think, with the intended audience, it is a very good game.

*iOS version. Have been wanting  this for some time now, but couldn't get an English copy. Need to learn how to play now.

Got the hang of it and am really enjoying it. Must get the cardboard version soon.

Got it, but waiting for birthday to roll around...

Finally got to play the cardboard version and am upping my rating. This game is a perfect match for my family. Theme is great for my young boys and gameplay is quick and easy. Co-ops are always a plus as it means no tears for the youngest after the game if he (we) loses. My wife loves the artwork, no complaints with the bits in this game. What a bargain!

Cooperative that is reasonably fun (although I understand Forbidden Desert is better).

This is pandemic, only with less fun and suspense. It felt like it used the exact same mechanisms, the only difference being this game's theme and lowered difficulty. And I don't consider Pandemic difficult (using the normal setting). So why buy it? Why even play it if you don't have children too young for its better big brother around?

Great cooperative game where you have to work together to find 4 artifacts and leave the island on your helicopter before it sinks. Actually, the island will sink more and more each turn. Cooperation is vital and thanks to the difficulty level selection, a good time is guaranteed for everyone!

Fantastic cooperative game, perfect for families.  Even works well with 2 players, although this probably increases the difficulty somewhat as it is harder to keep shoring up tiles while the island is sinking and you only have access to 2 special abilities - which may limit your options.

Only possible improvement could be that the tiles actually do something, or infer some form of bonus/penalty for being on them.  I found that sometimes is was pointless to take any action as you were where you wanted to be, and nothing was forcing me to use my actions.  This didn't happen very often, however, and is a minor criticism.

Heartily recommended, especially for the low retail price it commands.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much interaction it took to beat the game, you will spend the whole game constantly discussing your tactics and the time will fly by.

However, if I had to choose I will say that Pandemic is better game.

OWNED SINCE 2012
A fun game, and easy to learn. Very simple and fast. My only complaint is that someone usually takes the lead and "helps" others play their turn.  This is a common issue with other co-operative games as well, but it seems to be more of a problem with this game. Maybe because everyone's cards are visible and there are so few choices? Still a fun game and I do not regret having it.

This is another very popular game, I know. We enjoy it quite a lot (in fact, we have also picked up Forbidden Desert, but this has been since my original list of purchases). Again, this took a play or two for the younger kids, but now they have no problem with the player roles or strategy of the game. Too, we were happy to find several very cool variants within the forums here that have been challenging as well. If I were to recommend a starting point, yes even with our limited play experience, I would choose this game.

Awesome game!  As it's been said, it is 'Pandemic Light' but it sure is fun!  And though I like Pandemic a little more, with the people that I game with, this has already gotten way more playing time than Pandemic!

I was worried that getting both Forbidden Island and Flash Point at the same time would mean FI sees less playtime.

RATING: 6.5
This game, up to certain point, reminds me of Pandemic. Pandemic is more complex but, at some basic level, this can be considered a light version. It is a cooperative game where the players need to take every treasure on the island, for doing that, a certain number of cards of the specific color have to be played on the required location. Every player takes control of one character with unique abilities that, in combination with the rest of players, have to achieve the goal and leave the island before it is sunk under the sea.
It is a quick and fun game that works very well as a complement of a big strategic game. I do not play Forbidden Island as the main game of the afternoon.
Positive:
1. Easy to explain and play
2. It has a good level of difficulty
3. The box is comfortable to be transported
Negative:
1. There are some combination of characters that are doomed to fail
2. Like Pandemic, the round can be controlled by a "general" type of player that decides for the whole team what to do all the time

RATING: 10
This might be my favorite game of all time. I've never found it easy to answer the question, "What's your favorite game?," because I like so many different types of games, but this one would have a good chance of coming out on top. When it comes to Co-ops, I believe Pandemic is amazing, but Forbidden Desert is just a little more fun for me. This sequel Forbidden Island is even better than Desert, and therefore the best Co-op game in my opinion. It removes the set collection mechanic of the game that makes Desert feel similar to Pandemic. The new Storm mechanic is amazing. It has a smooth game play that make the game easier to play, but harder to win. The only thing slightly worse about this game is the components. The pieces of the ship that you use to make the ship look great, but are flimsier. Also, the tiles on my game are starting warp slightly and are no longer sitting as flat as they once did. Those are both minor quibbles. This game is fantastic!

Nice coop game that is very easy to learn.Wish they would have made the role cards with different backs because when you shuffle them you can tell which roles are where in the deck as you deal them out.Does not seem it would have been to hard to include 4 more cards that explain what you could do on each turn.

Forbidden Island is a blast. With artwork on par with Jamaica (another favorite), and simple addictive gameplay (not to mention nail-biting towards the end!), it's a must have. If you love co-op games, great artwork, and treasure hunting against the clock- BUY THIS GAME!

I traded out the normal pawns with my extra set of figures from 'The Adventurers"- what a difference the game makes. The pawns now match the artwork- as it should...My only real complaint with the game. 

UPDATE: Survive: Escape from Atlantis! has officially replaced Forbidden Island as the get off the island while you can game. No teamwork, just cutthroat right until the end. Replaced meeples with Lego Minifigures to add some much needed character to the game. Always a laugh to see the mime get eaten by the shark.

My Sunday night group played three different times.  Since this was the first time playing Forbidden Island, we began at the very lowest water level.  We won all three times, but it was close to the skull and crossbones on two occasions.  

We thought the game played out well with the co-op.  It was difficult on the first round of play since we didn't really know what we were doing.  However, we played a turn or two, and the idea of the game fell into place.  After that, we just discussed what we needed to do win, provided we didn't get the Water Rises! card.

Overall, good game to play for a quiet evening.  It's not an overly intensive game that demands a lot out of an individual.  The major short comings was knowing how many cards are in the deck.  Once you know you have the Water Risings! out of the way, it's pretty smooth sailing.  However, I might have played the Treasure Cards wrong, so I will need to review it.

Pandemic light is a good description but when you are taking what is already a great game and just distilling it down to it's primary components you really can't go wrong. Plays quick, easy to pick up, scales in difficulty and (IMO) less prone to quarterbacking than it's older brother.

As a fan of Pandemic, I avoided this game for a long time for fear it was too simple.  Having played it repeatedly on the iPad, I can say it is simpler, but not "too" simple.  The story arc is great (even compared to Pandemic, there is something exciting and satisfying about finally getting that fourth artifact and needing to get everyone back to the landing and onto the helicopter.  It would lose something compared to Pandemic, except that the huge variety of board configurations adds enough variety to keep it interesting.  It's not as tense and stressful as Pandemic, but still very fun.

I enjoy a cooperative game (though most of the decisions seemed fairly obvious, there was some discussion about the best way, which was good). This is quite a pretty game (nice tin packaging, nice tiles). I like the mechanic of the changing "board" layout. Nice, simple theme.

Enjoyed this one a lot at first but it suffers from the one player dominance of coop games. I dislike the extent to which the game can be decided by the luck of the draw also but I'm not sure how this could ever be changed as otherwise there would no longer be a game to beat. On the plus side I really enjoy the urgency that's created in the way that the island visually sinks. There have been some extremely tense games of this one.

We went to the games shop with a list of possible games to buy. They had both Pandemic and Forbidden Island in stock. My 9 year old really wanted this one, so Pandemic lost out.

It's a great game; the first cooperative game we've played as a family and I love the genre and it's a huge success as a family game.  Some tense moments.  I would have been more sanguine about the whole of Europe succumbing to Ebola than I am about my immediate family slowly drowning on a little Island, I think. So much for a supposedly family friendly alternative to Global disease meltdown.

Good times.

Probably a little too easy, but streamlines the rules of Pandemic beautifully. Less tracks and cubes to keep track of and it can be taught easily even if you're terrible at teaching things. Beautiful artwork and components also helps.

Don't get me wrong, this game isn't something I'd consider "not fun". This game is enjoyable for sure. Here's the thing though, we ended up playing Forbidden Island immediately after completing our first playthrough of Pandemic ... which as you may or may not know was ALSO created by Matt Leacock. Come to find out, it employs an EXTREMELY similar mechanic to Pandemic in its "Waters Rise!" card distribution (basically the exact same idea as the "Outbreak!" cards in Pandemic).

There's no real issue in that, but (as adult players) it felt a lot like a stripped down version of Pandemic -- something akin to more of a "children's version" of the same concept.

So there you go. If you've got Pandemic, stick with it. If you don't have either, grab Pandemic. If you've got kids, maybe Forbidden Island is a better choice. I dunno.

For us, we have decided that we will only pull out Forbidden Island if we are just way too intoxicated to make it through a round of Pandemic.

For me, this is Pandemic Light.  But that's not a bad thing.  Given the choice, I'll play Pandemic everytime, but if I'm playing this with family or non-gamers, I'll introduce this first.  Amazing art and a fun theme.  Setting the map up in different shapes allows for a variability in play that Pandemic doesn't really have.


UPDATE:  November 2012: Glad I kept this one around.  I sometimes come close to selling it and it's fortunate that I didn't.  Just replayed this with my family on Thanksgiving and it really was a blast.

Not the best or deepest game I've ever played, but when you consider the price, and it's intended audience (children and light gamers) this game is hard to beat. A great introduction game for others that is based on the same game mechanic as Pandemic. Not recommended for Pandemic experts.

I owned it, but gave it to my friend who was moving out of city for fare-well gift. Hope this game serves her and her other loving half well :).

This one plays just like Pandemic - as a matter of fact, if you own Pandemic, you can safely skip this one and not miss a thing. Only two upsides Forbidden Island had over Pandemic were prettier arts, and simpler game play. Thus, if you are introducing a game to NBG friends, or young kids, this one is a great one to start out with. But after few plays, you will probably feel that you would want to look for something a bit heavier than this game. For this reason, I would actually try out Forbidden Desert instead of Forbidden Island.

Suffers a bit from being a watered down pandemic, but it is still a solid game that uses the same mechanics and good for introducing a younger generation or new gamers into co-op games and is a favorite amongst the afterschool (Age 8/9) club I run.

This is a quick, fun coop game. Simple enough to play with just about anyone, and challenging enough that you're almost sure to lose often. The modular board and variable player powers make for high replayability.

All of the above is still true, but this game has been replaced by Pandemic (which I think happens for pretty much everyone sooner or later).

I just learned and played this with 3 other participants in a library board game night. The setup and structure of the game took a little bit more time than I expected, but we started playing within 10 minutes (including reading the rule book out loud and setting up all the tiles/cards). We all loved this game, and managed to lose when we completely sunk both tiles with the same treasure within the same player's flood card draw. . We are all excited to play it again in our next board game night!

Quick, light, and fun.
Keeps many of the Pandemic mechanics in a stripped down, simple and quick coop. Probably the new standard for an entry level/gateway coop game - especially at $15.99 MSRP.

I agree with the "Pandemic for all ages" comment. Forbidden Island has a simpler game board, large "fun" pieces, more visually appealing, less "disconcerting"/serious theme, fewer actions per player turn, and fewer actions to choose from.

The only thing I would have changed is adding a stand-up for the water level card (which is a modification I'm making to my own set).

If you haven't played Pandemic, then this is a good, fun, co-op, with degrees of difficulty. The sinking island part is fun; the artwork is nice; the design is nice... an all round good game, especially for children (it has gone down very well in groups of kids I've introduced it to). However, if you have played Pandemic, you might find yourself missing it when playing this.

Would rather play pandemic, my family didn't get the coop mechanism, the actions, the special abilties or whatever it was all about (they also realy struggle with Ticket to Ride, they have to be told what actions you can do in a round again and again and play 2 routes at the time, even though I just told them you can't do that the previous round, where they tried the same). They are not boardgamers, that's for certain. (though they play chess fairly well. Strange)

I think all the previous descriptions of this as Pandemic-light are dead on. Many of the same mechanics at play here. I do think this is a good game, not quite as interesting or strategic as Pandemic, but something I can play with my 8-year-old son. Pandemic would be a bit much for him.

RATING: 7
This was my first intro to the cooperative game world, and if I had rated it then, I probably would've said 10 out of 10. It's a solid game, and it's a great one to pull out when I invite a non-gamer to one of our game nights. It's approachable and fun and a newbie will feel supported instead of attacked by experienced players. It actually has converted some newbie non-gamers I know into full on game geeks. Think of it as a "gateway drug."

Having said all that, I have since played Forbidden Desert and Pandemic (same designer) and I like them both a great deal more. Forbidden Island and Desert are actually extremely similar, but the few things that are different in Desert add so much depth and variation for replayability. Pandemic shares some similar mechanics in how the game attacks the players, but the player interaction and turn execution is very different, not to mention the thick list of cool expansions Pandemic has.

I want to say again, this is a good game, a fun game. The lower price point than those other two, and easier setup and explanation of this game for newbies does make it a great one to have in the collection. If you were only going to own one co-op game, I would choose one of the other two Matt Leacock designed, but I actually plan to own them all.

Superficial gameplay, though the theme is strong and works smoothly with the mechanics. The simplicity makes it kinda dull if there are only 2 players. But the game plays quick and there is a ton of player interaction, so I'm almost always willing to play if asked.

I don't care what anyone else says, this is a delightful little game.  Easy to pick up and start playing right away.  Oh, but what a wonderful job at establishing a sense of dread and need to hurry, hurry, hurry.  But that's where the game gets you.  You need to think.  You need to plan.  You need to make sure that every step counts.  I am loving this game! I have been playing this game for a week now and my wife and I have won it once.  ONCE!  And that's because we were playing it wrong.  What does it feel like to me?  It feels like Indiana Jones, the board game.  You race.  You think.  You scavenge for treasure.  You co-operate.  What a fantastic game!

Forbidden Island is a calculated foray into the mass market. The game is patterned on designer Matt Leacock's previous game, Pandemic, which has enjoyed huge success within the confines of the boardgaming hobby. Though I wish Leacock success with a newer, potentially larger audience, Forbidden Island has nothing to offer me as a Pandemic fan. All of it's mechanisms are derived and diluted from the previous game, making it less interesting across the board and robbing it of any distinguishing features. In particular, the roles of the game are nearly equivalent in that they all amount to "conserve an action."  

Forbidden Island is an extremely inexpensive, nice-looking game. However, I question it's necessity as a "bridge" game. I can already get most people to play and enjoy Pandemic. 

Though in this case I can appreciate the goal, the trend of taking excellent, well-loved games and "streamlining" them continues to yield awful results.

A very fun cooperative game. You are on an island that holds 4 treaures. During the course every turn after your 3 actions per turn you get 2 treasure cards. You must get 4 like treasure cards to go to the place that holds said treasures to collect said treasure. In the meanwhile the island is sinking all around you. Your job is to help each other out so you can all get off the island safely with the 4 treasures. Short, and fun with cool bits. I recommend it!

This is obviously Pandemic lite, and I enjoy Pandemic more, but Forbidden Island still gets a high rating from me because:

I actually like the Pandemic theme more, though I would say that the artwork and tile layout in Forbidden Island is more pleasing.  But in stripping the game down to the most basic element, it's easy to pick up and play and plays a little more quickly.  Maybe I'll eventually tire of it, but for now I really enjoy it.

Love the artwork.  The different player roles are exciting.  Gameplay is tense and fun.  

The only problem is it got old after five plays.  I'm gonna try the variant tile setups and see if that helps.

I couldn't have been more disappointed with this game. I really wanted to like it, but it just feels like it could play itself.  It's far too easy.  I'd suppose that it is great for pre-teenage children who are still learning the mechanics of strategy games.

This is a pretty good gateway game but not for experienced gamers.  The mechanics are simple and the play feels repetitive.  I will play it if asked but would never suggest it.

I like the game. It is well designed co-op, typical of Matt Leacock. I sometimes feel there is not quite *enough* in the game to keep it interesting... (and then Forbidden Desert came along, offering that bit extra). Would probably trade this in for Forbidden Desert if given the opportunity...but prefer Pandemic or Flash Point: Fire Rescue, if I had to pick up a Tuesday Night Co-Op game.

Everyone told me how light and dumbed down it was. I was expecting this game to replace Pandemic, with the cool tiles and awesome box, but after playing it, I was a bit disappointed.

Definitely too simple for regular gaming. It might be okay for occasional play, but I think I will still have to stick to Pandemic for now.

Forbidden Island of Pandemic...or something like that.  If you've played and won Pandemic you need to play this set on harder than normal.  The randomness of the tile layout might make it harder and the roles selected might make it harder, but even at that I think you will need to set it up a notch.
Good game though.
A couple more plays with four people show that it isn't as easy to win as I thought.  Maybe play on Elite with three people and Normal with four.

Solitaire friendly Co-op.  This is a fun game with a lot of suspense in the gameplay.  Also, with six characters to choose from, a random set-up of the game tiles, and alternate set-up configurations possible, the replayability is very high.

Forbidden Island was one of the first fully co-op games that I have played and I have always tough it's a pretty good game.

Very similar to Pandemic (same author) but with streamlined rules. I actually like Forbidden Island better than Pandemic. It takes less footprint on the table, the map of the island is smaller, traveling around it is more straightforward between the tiles than along the lines of a complex map in Pandemic. Besides no more fiddly infection cubes on the board, just turn the tile on its back to make it flooded or take it away from the map to make it gone under water forever. Overall I recommend it to anyone considering buying Pandemic - try this one instead - it’s pretty much the same thing, only less confusing to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and accessible.  But it's thematically weird that you're waiting to draw the cards you need to be able to win, instead of being able to do anything proactive to enable a win.  Definitely a game about holding on and keeping your head above water (literally!), and not about exploring and trying to recover the lost artifacts.

Terrible game.  It just has no depth... I tried to like it, I really did, there are just better games out there.

This is effectively a dumbed-down pandemic (which I hasten to add I'm also not a fan of either) however I didn't give it my original rating of 3 as I can see it's appeal to youngsters. (I will however never play this again)

My recommendation is if you have kids it's cheap and they may enjoy it but it is exceedingly shallow.

(Please take into account I may be bitter as I read a few reviews heralding it as a great cooperative game and I was far from impressed.)

In a parallel universe where this predated Pandemic I might well have given it another point, complimenting the clever "it puts the cards on the deck" mechanism. In this world, there's nothing here that doesn't feel like a repeat with pretty much every aspect reduced in complexity and dressed in a less disturbing theme for family appeal. The topography is simplified, local threat levels are binary and isolated. It doesn't feel like you have many nonobvious choices, or much chance of success once the negative feedback loop gets going. And with the cards all open by decree, there's really no reason why there should be more than one person making decisions.

I've only played this game 3 or 4 times, with children and with adults, but I'm not keen to play it again.

Its central mechanics of steadily increasing threat, and calamity repeatedly hitting the same places, are identical to Pandemic. The theme of collecting cards, too, and taking them to some specified location. The idea of collecting stuff reflects the cured disease. So in a sense, this is a kind of Pandemic reskin, but I don't think it works.

Pandemic builds tension about whether you can win the game, and the alternative possible actions for the various characters leads to interesting discussion and clever strategies. In Forbidden Island, the alternatives are never really distinct enough to discuss, and as for winning or losing, I have never been able to care.

I prefer pandemic, but with some groups I definitely prefer this. It really lit a fire with my son around the time he turned 6. He had shown some interest in games before (Kids of Carcassonne; Duck, Duck, Bruce; Spot it). Forbidden Island produced a kind of zeal and focus I had not seen before. This is the first time I did not need to suggest a game: he got it off the shelf himself and began setting it up. Just one play was enough to fascinate him and after two plays he wanted to draw his own cards and name new parts of the island.

The game is often described as pandemic light. It's better described as Pandemic for families. I understand that is what Gamewright asked Leacock to do. That is, to take the pandemic system, streamline, and make it more accessible to younger children. He delivers on that in spades.

It is easy to teach, easy to learn, and plays quickly. It works well with a range of ages. It's a pleasant experience, with less tension and complexity than Pandemic, but still tense. One of the great family games. 

I would rate this for me, and my tastes, about a 4 or 5. Given the choice I'd rather play something else. But when I consider the design and the target audience, this game is at least an 8. Everything about this game is excellent: the design, the gameplay, the production. And the price is amazing too.

Family members really loved this game during our Christmas get-together. It was continually requested. I personally don't mind it but don't enjoy it as much as they did. 

It is a cooperative game which means you need to watch out for bossier or louder individuals taking control of gameplay by dictating everyone's moves. We had a few situations where quieter players felt they didn't get to have a say. They complained that the game was worthless if they just moved their pieces in the way that others dictated. Had to monitor everyone's input after that to make sure the game was truly cooperative.

This game was the first designer boardgame I bought, mostly because of how cheap it is. I like the cooperative aspect and I like that it's fairly easy to learn. Despite being easy to learn it's a fairly hard game. I've played about 6 games and only won once and it was because we were failing to discard the land cards when the tile was removed from the board.

There's a lot of strategy that goes into this and I like that every game is different due to the randomized map. I'd say it's a bit unbalanced though, it's very hard to beat without the engineer in my experience.

I really like this game though, I wish my friends liked it more!

Edit: By the way the quality of the game is much higher than I expected for $16 which I paid for it. The value is excellent.

A surprisingly fun Matt Leacock game!  I didn't expect too much from this having already played Pandemic and Forbidden Desert which were basically successors to the cooperative engine developed in Forbidden Island.  But I really liked it a lot!  Maybe even more than Forbidden Desert which is an all time favorite of mine.  It has a similar feel to Forbidden Desert but my biggest complaint about Desert is constantly having to put out all the fiddly desert cards.  There is none of that with Island which makes it easier and more suitable for nights when I'm feeling like a simpler game.

I much prefer Forbidden Desert for our Pandemic lite game.  This one is a bit too simple and I find the decisions are almost always obvious and straight forward. Still we keep it around because it plays well to introduce kids or non-gamers to coops without being overly long and still being a game I can find some enjoyment in.  It's thematic enough that it sort of tells a story as you play through (Although it's basically the same story every play through assuming you win).

My good friend introduced my wife and I to this game and it IS like Pandemic lite. However, it is nice because the stress levels seem to be lower in this game but the stakes are just as high. That's why I own this and not Pandemic.

Also, the sinking island theme is great!

This is a very nice cooperative family game built on the same basic chasis as Pandemic.  But the differences between the two games are still pretty significant, making it well worth the incredibly low price to buy this as well.  The "sinking" mechanic of the island is really cool and adds a lot to the experience, and the differences in how the decks are constructed make for a nice twist as well.  If you're into coops and have a need for a family game or light (20-30min) filler, then this is WELL worth it.

I bought this game from Kohl's for around $40 something (Target sold it for way cheaper: $17.99). I have played Forbidden Island with my friends afterschool and my brother. So far I have played it around 5 times or more. This game is a very fun cooperative game. We always discuss the moves we want to make and what is essential to help us win. The roles are pretty cool too and give you nice abilities. This game does get boring though. If you play it to often in a row, you might need a long break. I found this game to be pretty unpredictable, which adds to the fun/ Overall, it is something I enjoy playing just not to often. I plan on getting a similar game called Forbbidden Dessert very soon.

I don't normally play co-op games because it usually becomes a solitaire game with audiences. I feel weird to play the game in front of others. I feel weirder to tell someone what to do for his game. Solo play might work time to time. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful little game I would live to play sometimes.

Poor man's pandemic.  Quite an easy game once you realize you only need to save 5 tiles and a pathway to them.  The game scales well but the challenge just isn't there. This would be a great 1st co-op game, but I played Pandemic first (which effectively ruined this game for me)

Includes Artscow expansion set. Highly recommended for longevity of the game!

This is a simple game, but that's not always a bad thing. It presents itself like a puzzle begging to be solved, and even if some situations are unwinnable (due to the luck of the draw), there are enough moments where an elaborately orchestrated cooperative maneuver pays off to make the tension feel real every time.

RATING: 8
I LOVE any game that plays differently each time, plus, it's a nice change of place from competitive to cooperative. In this case, the game tiles always lay out differently every time, and your roles always change, so replay value is high.

It gets a higher score, because it's HARD. You really need to make as few mistakes as possible to win, so the incentive to play is always high, because you WANT to beat the game, knowing you've tasted plenty of defeat in the past...

Yes. I copied and pasted. They are that similar of games. I give Desert the slight edge because of it's steampunk-esque art direction, and the Indiana Jones discovering a lost city in the desert feel. Mechanics differ slightly, and I think I prefer excavating game tiles and finding things, over keeping the island afloat, as you do in Forbidden Island...

Forbidden Island is a fairly simple game, the kind you'd enjoy playing with your 10-year-old niece or nephew.  Since it's cooperative, there's no competition among the players.  Everyone wins or loses together.  Luck is a minor though unavoidable component of the game, and the mechanics allow for a highly adjustable difficulty level.  This isn't a strong favorite of mine, but it's a good pick if you want to include a cooperative game that appeals to a wide range of ages.

My daughter likes this game but I think it's somewhat lame.  If I'm going to play a family game, I'd select Castle Panic or Ark and Noah before Forbidden Island.  I think if your child can handle Forbidden Island you should just bear through a couple games of Pandemic where you're making most of the choices for them.

A great co-op game where you all win or all lose together.  Every player assumes a different role, each with a unique ability.  The game does a great job of building tension as the island begins to flood while everyone is chasing down a treasure or trying to get to the helipad.

RATING: 7.8
After one play: It feels very much like Pandemic, with the same mechanisms (collecting 4 card, putting the deck back on top), but with another theme and some slight differences (shore up a tile).

But as I absolutly love Pandemic, I like this too.

Update: With two players it works really nice as well (whereas Pandemic can be a bit hard for two players)!

RATING: 7
We enjoy [thing=30549][/thing], so we were curious how this would play  and it was cheap enough that picking it up was an easy decision. The components are really good, although the cards were fairly warped. The artwork and theme is a lot more colorful and approachable than Pandemic as well. In terms of gameplay, while the mechanics and actions are taken from Pandemic, the game does feel different. You start with a new map each game.  You no longer have outbreak chain reactions. Instead, different parts of the map itself start sinking.  This should give more variety to the game.

However, we didn't really feel any tension---the easiest thing would be to increase the difficulty, which we did do later. But even if there were a couple of map tiles out of the way that were flooded, we didn't feel any need to go way out of our way to shore them up. Pandemic felt much more thematic in that respect---you're treating the diseases in different cities, which also has the side effect of reducing outbreaks and so forth. In Forbidden Island, thematically we didn't see a need to shore up those far flung map tiles, especially if they weren't important (i.e., not treasure tiles or Fool's Landing). The only reason is for a gameplay mechanism---you need to keep the flood deck more diluted so as to not flood the important areas. It felt more puzzle-like and less intense for that reason.

We definitely prefer Pandemic by a large margin. I've taught it to many non-gamers, so I don't feel a need to get an even more approachable version.  We also tend to prefer these type of coop games with more than just two anyway, as that adds to the cooperative, working-togeher feeling.

Fun, super-light coop game. Designed by the designer of Pandemic, this is basically Pandemic Junior, aimed at a younger set.

RATING: 9
Updated rating 7.5 > 9.  Excellent replay value.  Already a family favourite due to the clear and concise rules (supported by the excellent rulebook), clarity of instructions on the cards where special actions are needed and the co-operative nature of the game which is not as 'complicated' as Pandemic so every player can contribute without feeling marginalised.

Pre Dec 11 

What has not been said already, a great family co-operative game for those who fear drowning more than dying from an infectious disease.

We play with a wide range of age groups so have the water levels firmly starting at 2 however look forward to increasing it a bit soon and raising the challenge.  I have no worries though as we are British and it is in our genetic make-up to steal treasures from foreign lands with no thought to the environment or local habitats.

This game is indeed Pandemic-lite. The strategy-luck ratio of this game is very low, but I imagine it would be great for kids to introduce them to co-ops, the game looks great, and the sinking island adds much more tension than Pandemic's disease cubes in my opinion.

To call this a rip-off of Pandemic is weird, because it's the same guy who made Pandemic.  But this game is just a re-themed Pandemic.  It takes about two minutes to learn (less if you know Pandemic) and is simple to strategize (simpler if you know Pandemic).  The theme isn't as compelling, nor the board as difficult.  However, it makes a nice gateway gift if you're into that sort of thing.

Forbidden Island is a lot of fun but gets a 6 because it ends up being a discussion about how each player should play their card. It might be more enjoyable if there was somehow less discussion and more playing. I haven't thought of anyway to do that yet.

RATING: 7
I'm not the biggest fan of co-ops but this is such good value. Great quality and a decent little game that I can play with the kids. I do quite like the puzzle quality of it, something I'd admired in my solo play, but there is that little niggle that if the next card had been something else we could have won and it is so arbitrary that we did not. You might say that perhaps you should not be in such a situation but the clever thing in this game is that the increasing pace of sinking ups the tempo and puts you in that kind of situation, like it or not. In short, I'm glad I have it and will play with upon request (especially with the kids) but it did show us that co-ops aren't really our thing and so we don't need to own any more.

RATING: 2
This game completely soured me on the cooperative genre. I want to play against other people - not against a game designer who stacks all the rules in his favor and makes it so your team could be doomed on literally the very first card you flip over, or even before that (if the tiles are set up in a hostile way).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I am not a fan of cooperative games.  Not to mention that for as simple as this game is, it's quite fiddly--always having to re-shuffle the decks, sometimes repeatedly shuffling only 2-4 cards.  A bit annoying.  And I don't usually shy away from fiddly games (e.g. Agricola, Dominant Species, At the Gates of Loyang, etc.)

But this game redeems itself because my children like it, and we can play together as a family.

This is a quick, pleasant game with a charming backstory. It doesn't have a great deal of strategic depth, but manages to generate a lot of suspense in a short time, I think it's probably THE very best 'gateway" game on the Geek for gently introducing hapless Hasbro/Milton Bradley victims to the idiosyncratic charms of Euro-style gaming. In spite of being pretty easy to learn, it manages to incorporate many of the most distinctive mechanics from that genre: co-op play, one-per-player rules exceptions, and game turns that consist of choosing from a menu of possible actions. Also, the art and the plastic bling are absolutely gorgeous & worthy of sustained contemplation.

A solid family weight cooperative game with simple mechanics.  You are trying to get treasure off an island before it sinks.  You work together to collects sets of cards and travel to the spot with where you get the treasure.  Once you have the treasure you travel back to Fools Landing and play a helicopter card to leave.  Each player has different abilities and the game will eliminate a lot of tiles quickly.  You must share cards to win.  

Very fun and a great family weight game.

This is kind of unfair of me, but I got this game after already owning Pandemic, and while Forbidden Island is fun, the similarities between the two just makes Pandemic the far superior game. (Both are Z-Man games, so the parallel mechanics are understandable; I like to refer to Forbidden Island as "Pandemic Lite.") It's a great concept, but it's not as exciting as Pandemic for me. However, the art is beautiful, and it's a very good primer for people new to gaming, especially if you plan to introduce them to Pandemic eventually.

RATING: 5.5
This is essentially a "lite" version of Pandemic. Pandemic is a game that I wanted to like, but after several plays, and checking and re-checking the rulebook, I still can't win, and I find it unforgivingly difficult. Not so with Forbidden Island, which seems quite winnable.

Unfortunately, it seems that in the end, the starting difficulty really just determines a probability of success. The game is not an intelligent opponent, and so, just like with Pandemic, there are really no surprises. Without the rich theme of a game like Arkham Horror, this is all just a bit dull. I sometimes wonder if the success of co-op games has more to do with the fact that many geeks struggle to find gaming partners than it does with anything inherently interesting about coop games.

The game is a real bargain for what you get component-wise. Gameplay is very straightforward, decision making not as tense as in Pandemic, game length pretty short, maybe 30 minutes. I like the game for what it is.  Makes a great game to start or end the day with, allows for some lighthearted fun, but atill there is enough game there to keep it from being stale or boring.

Terrific family game. I've raised my rating a couple times now because of how consistently successful it's been with kids and mixed ages.

We lost in something like 3 turns on our very first play, but it was easy to get going again, and those particular circumstances appear to be rare.

After getting good, the kids now play some of the island variations. I tried the volcano with them. It's a small change but makes it interesting.

You're an archaeological team sent to investigate a rumor of a long-dead but advanced island civilization, and to recover artifacts which allegedly control the four classical elements. You arrive at the island but trip its defensive measures, causing the island to start to permanently sink into the ocean. Your team must quickly gather all four artifacts and reach the helicopter pad to escape.

Great family and gateway co-op game. Racing against the sinking island to secure the loot is fun and keeps everyone engaged. The last few turns become very tense as the water's rise. Component quality sets this apart from the pack. From the metal tin to the sculpted treasures to the superb island tile art, this game is in the top tier of quality games.

After 2 plays, I'd like to like this game more, but it's just a dumbed-down Pandemic variant by the same designer.  It has the same basic flaw as Pandemic: it's a single-player game disguised as a cooperative multi-player game.  I'll play a bit more, give it another chance.

I gave it a chance and my opinion is unchanged.

Although it is a bit lighter, it has a more interesting (to us) theme, is more aesthetically pleasing, and while still tense, is more fun. (We don't think Pandemic is 'fun'.)

I bought this to play solo and take a break away from Pandemic.  It's fun and the art is fantastic.  I'm pretty sure I don't enjoy it as much as Pandemic, but the pressure feels the same.  There's nothing like having the island sink away beneath your feet.  I have yet to play it on expert though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's more about having fun than a thoughtful strategy, a game session runs quick and smooth but with a nice dose of adrenaline (the island is sinking!). My only observation is that at the begining of a game it seems like you are only making random moves while you end your turn to obtain treasure cards, thankfully that sensation doesn't last too long as the game gain momentum through the dissapearing tiles.

IMHO is a nice introductory game to non gamers, and propably will work great with the youngest of the family.

BTW the art and general production of the game is awesome.

Update: you got to play it with the non-standard island setups, It is way more fun than the default setup
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light co-op for 2-4 players, also know as Pandemic-lite. Players move around the flooding island, shoring it up while they collect 4 clues to each of 4 treasures. Once they're got all 4 treasures they have to get away in the helicopter. Fun theme and nice execution. Have fan expansion with tile layouts, additional roles, traitor.

Nice game, especially if you're looking for something that lasts no more than 45 minutes, is cheap or can accomodate children (I'd say they can enjoy it from 8yo, but that's a guess).

My only gripe is that it IS really a Pandemic light. There is almost nothing new here to people that already own Matt Leacock's other fantastic game. No new mecanism, and the feel of play is exactly the same, except for the theme. So, for the (admittedly small) amount of money I gave for this, I'd rather have had something really new. So the only people I wouldn't recommend it to are those who already have its big brother and aren't bothered by its reasonable play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great, short game for 2-4 players.  Very much "Pandemic Lite," as others have mentioned.  Still, it's quite thematic, and works well as a family game.  Worth picking up, especially because it's so cheap!

I wish it weren't in a tin.  Not a fan of tins.

Haven't played this in awhile, but I think when the kids are a little older (5?) they'll enjoy it.

A co-operative game that forces the group of players to survive a sinking island while trying to recover the 4 treasures along the way.

Overall, recommended for family with children, but not for those who prefer strategies and themes.

To quote my wife, "With Pandemic, I feel like I'm trying to win.  With Forbidden Island, I feel like I'm trying not to lose."

While Forbidden Island is mechanically a simpler version of Pandemic, it manages more tension in a much shorter time.  For that reason, I actually prefer this over its big brother.  But it does suffer from the possibility of a first turn loss, so I knocked it down a point from 8 to 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It sounds like Pandemic Lite, but after reading about it I expected something a bit different -- it actually is Pandemic Lite. More family friendly, faster (the biggest difference), and less prone to railroading newer players -- all good things. The components are great; the tiles are pretty, and the treasures are exceptional. It will be easier to introduce to new gamers, and more fun for the casual gamers in our extended circle.

On the flipside, it's much less interesting than Pandemic. It's still tense, but the optimal course of action is almost always clear on every turn. The randomness of the Waters Rise card distribution introduces some tension in a new way, but even that can be accounted for.

I haven't wanted to play this in three years, it's time for it to go. Re-rated from a 7 to a 6 and sold.

Great for -what it is-, and that is a quick filler / introductory game that kids over probably eight will enjoy and so will spouses who like simple games and don't want husbands picking on them.

There are extra layout tiles and professions on artscow that will definitely add a little replay ability to the game.

A co-op game to collect card sets to rescue items from a sinking island. Same mechanic as Forbidden Desert and Pandemic, with cards causing problems. The game suffers from Alpha gaming much more then its sisters.

The fact that Matt Leacock managed to make a game with slightly easier rules than his previous masterpiece Pandemic but with just as much excitement astounds me. If anything, the slightly easier rules make me more eager to teach it to my potential real life gaming partners than with Pandemic, and with more plays, I predict this will become a 9.

My only issue is that the rules aren't as precise regarding certain things as in Pandemic, requiring more use of BoardGameGeek to learn the finer details (such as how precisely the Diver works, or how the Navigator interacts with the Pilot and Diver). Thankfully, Matt Leacock is very generous with explanations on the forums!

Somewhat of an obsession when first bought for our 5 and 8 year old though now retired to the shelf.  Quicker and easier than Pandemic and worth a good few plays, though the (somewhat laudable) coop mechanic does eventually limit replayability as in the end you are all playing against the same player (the mechanic) repeatedly, rather than one another.

Forbidden Island is a light co-op game in which players are explorers trying to find four treasures and leave the island before it sinks into the sea.  The entire island is a grid of tiles that will start on their face up coloured side, eventually flip to their monochromatic blue side as that part of the island floods, and eventually be removed from the game altogether as it is lost to the sea.

Players start with a character card which lets them know what their special ability is.  Then when it's your turn you can do three actions which are any combination of: move, shore up (which means turning a blue flooded tile back to its coloured side), give a card to someone else, or turn in a set of cards to find/take the matching treasure.  The next thing they'll do is take two treasure cards from the treasure deck.  These will either be helpful cards that will go toward them finding the treasures, because when you have four of the same type of treasure card you can go to the appropriate tile, trade them in, and get the treasure.  Or, they may be detrimental "waters rise" cards which will go a long way toward making the players lose.  The last thing players do on their turn is flip over the number of flood cards equal to the current waters rise level.  These cards match the tiles on the island and you flip, or remove tiles matching the flood cards you draw.

Players win together if they all survive, get all four treasures, and escape the island.  If they miss any of these criteria they lose.

I like Forbidden Island.  It's an easy game to understand and play, but not necessarily an easy game to win.  The components are top notch, especially the four treasures which are nicely rendered out of plastic.  This would be a good one to play with new gamers, kids, or when you don't want to play for very long.  I definitely recommend it.

Best game of 2010.
Awesome lighter co-op. Some days I even prefer it to Pandemic because it's 2x faster. It's action point co-op boiled down to its basics, leaving just enough space for theme, and why wouldn't that recipe work. Unlike some say, it's not too easy if you use proper difficulty level, you can't 'solve' random game. Alternate setups found on BGG are must after 10 games or so though, to keep it fresh. Great components for the price.

Played this on 13/8/2010 for the first time with a group of Year 5 students at school (10-11 yr olds). It was a huge hit, they wanted to play it again straight away - meanwhile we had a cluster of children around us who wanted to know what the new game was. Even a first teaching game took only around 45 minutes, making it fit well into our games program.
The resemblance to Pandemic is clear but this is a good game in its own right. It seems much easier, perhaps because players can take a strategic approach to letting tiles be eliminated from the game.

If you have Pandemic, don't bother with Forbidden Island. Pandemic is way better for those looking for a good game. The mechanics are so similar for both, that they don't seem like seperate games... Forbidden Island = Pandemic "lite". Forbidden Island is more approachable to non-gamers and takes less time to play, with fewer rules than Pandemic. I'd suggest Forbidden Island as a gateway game for non-gamers new to the hobby, or as a training tool for Pandemic to get people used to a cooperative game with variable player powers and the need to "put out fires" while making progress towards winning the game. My wife and I have played Forbidden Island a few times and were left unimpressed. We love Pandemic and felt Forbidden Island was a step down on the fun factor. Like I said, Forbidden Island would be a better (i.e. more approachable) game for younger or newer players, but is not different enough from Pandemic to count it as a seperate game, and is not nearly as fun to play or challenging/rewarding to play as Pandemic.

*update: for a this game has been replaced by pandemic: the cure as our intro to coop games and a great "Pandemic 101" course to build up to the fully immersive Pandemic experience.

Until now I haven't liked co-ops, I'm more the competitive kind of gamer. Anyhow I'm looking forward to try a lot of good ranked games in this category. Forbidden Island, even though isn't fun for me, is a very good game to play with children, family or casual gamers. High production value, this game is simply beautiful. 

After another play I'm happy that I gave my copy of Forbidden Island to my brother so I can still play it, this is a gorgeous game and a hard one if you increase the water level, 2 games in a row last time, amazing agonic fun! Up to 7: Good Coop suitable for the family, short enough to serve as a filler.

Fun co-op game for the whole family. Simple rules, beautiful artwork and components, some thinking required but not enough to get a headache.  Difficulty can be tailored to the appropriate level for the players on hand, and board setup is different every game.  This is THE gateway co-op game for non-gamers as far as I'm concerned.  It also helps that the game is incredibly cheap at $13 or so.

Component quality is amazing.  Tile art is beautiful and the treasure pieces are very nice.  My kids want to play with the treasure pieces more than they want to play the game.

I really like this game - 2 player is the most fun. It is not the deepest game and yes, the choices are obvious. However the theme works so well and the game plays so quickly that it really feels like you are racing to escape a sinking island. The beautiful components, quick set up, ease of explanation, quick play time, and thematic experience really make this little gem shine. This is my first taste of a co-op game and I really enjoyed it. The game is also really tough to beat, making it even more fun, IMO. However, it is what it is. If you are looking for a complex and strategic main event, this is not it.

A fun game for sure.  Nice mechanics and fast paced.   It does leave me wishing for a little more meat though, as the best moves tend to be pretty obvious.  At the hardest difficulty level, the game realy boils down to the order you draw your cards.  You'll either hit the highest flood level or get the last card you need to win.  Kind of a random ending to an otherwise fine game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
First Impressions: Beautifully made game with a really fun mechanic. The co-operative aspect is a nice change of pace from every other game I own, and especially some of the screw-your-friend styles.
Played with 2 players. On the easier levels, the game just doesn't seem to be that difficult. There never seemed to be any real risk of losing. Forbidden Island is fast and fun, with our first games lasting around the 20-30 minute mark. Great value for the low pricepoint.

Updated Impressions: On the 3rd and 4th plays the next day, we upped the starting water level difficulty and felt the urgency a little more. With random board layout, the game sometimes gives you an easy play through, while other times creating more of a challenge. This will remain a fun filler game when we want to play something quick and easy after dinner or on a rainy afternoon, or serve as a bridge game to introduce new games.

Possible 2 Player Variation: I thought it would increase the tension if each of the two players had 2 or 3 Adventurer cards. On each turn, the player would rotate to the next Adventurer role in their hand and only use those advantages for that turn. This would ensure that the Helicopter Pilot can only bounce around and save the day once every 4 or 6 turns.  



NB: I have never played Pandemic, but it seems to be law here on BGG that any review of Forbidden Island compare it to Pandemic.

co-op game.  Try to gain possession of 4 artifacts before the island sinks around you.  Its quick to play and offers good tension in how to approach things.

Positives:
+ nice components for easy play
+ lots of different roles to choose from adds to replayability
+ variable island shape adds replayability
+ easy to understand game play 
+ little down time between turns
+ fairly easy to adopt for solo play

Cons:
- sometimes feels a little too simple (actions seemed obvious in the first two games played)
- sometimes hard to find specific tiles as graphics can sometimes be too close to each other

I was lucky enough to find an image of "variant tile layouts" from the German edition posted on BGG. Varying the tile layouts really ratchets up the difficulty of the game and adds replayability.

Rating based on 2 plays so far with 2 and 3 players.  Very nice.  I wondered how a slimmed-down Pandemic would work and it works beautifully.  Same tension, same cooperation, same feelings of hopelessness at time, but even simpler to play.  Sweet, in a sad, hopeless, we're all going to sink into the sea and die kind of way.

We love Pandemic and this is a great intro for younger players or casual gamers (very similar co-operative mechanics).  The art is fantastic and it plays pretty quickly.  For those wanting a deeper experience, I would recommend Pandemic instead as Forbidden Island is fun, but might have more limited replayability.  Flash Point: Fire Rescue is another great family-friendly co-op game in this same vein.

Game in a Nutshell: Players work together to collect four treasures off a sinking island and fly away before being sucked into the ocean’s abyss.

Played as: 2,3,4 player

Pros: The first thing that stands out is the amount of quality game that is packed into such a reasonably priced package. Really, it’s a steal, from component quality to gameplay.  Not too difficult of a game from a rules standpoint, but still offers a brutally challenging goal and great sense of tension.  Definitely has that snowball feeling as the game progresses, as things start deteriorating faster and faster, all leading up to generally close, pressure-filled ending. The game seems to scale very well, both in players and difficulty, and the number of different roles seems to be at a level that should keep things fresher for longer.

Cons: After a few plays, I’m sure the chance of success is going to have more to do with luck then skill once players figure the game out.  Doesn’t do a whole lot better then its bigger brother Pandemic.

Other: Just a note on this game compared to Pandemic-- They are both still very familiar in flow, but I think Forbidden Island presents some new challenges not seen in Pandemic that will force veterans of the later to think in new ways or face multiple deaths. Do you need to own them both? Maybe, maybe not. If Forbidden Island wasn’t so stinking cheap, I’d lean towards no; but it is cheap, so maybe. If I were to only own one, I’d stick with Pandemic; but one thing I haven’t mentioned is what FI is intended for and that’s a younger audience. I’ve only played with adults so that’s one dynamic I can’t comment on. 

Best Use: The quickest Co-op out there that’s plenty accessible for a range of players.

The very best thing about this game is that my sister is willing to play.  I would find it a lot more entertaining if she was willing to embrace its cooperative aspects.  I've tried to discuss possible strategies we could use, and she tells me to either stop talking and go or just tell her what I want her to do.  Still, she is willing to play.  Also I can play this game solo, although it's not a game I pull out for that.

A lot of fun, nice simple little game. If you like it and want more get Forbidden desert. If you do get it youll play Forbidden desert more but I dont think this one will gather too much dust and thats a big compliment even comparing this too Forbidden desert.

RATING: 7
It's a good co-op that's easy to play, but challenging to win. I think I prefer the outbreak mechanics that make Pandemic such a thrilling game, but this one is probably much more accessible to a general audience. I might pick this one up one day, but it's just too close to its big brother.

Update: Although I did get a copy if this and enjoyed it many times, my rating has gone down because it just doesn't have the depth of Pandemic and many other co-op games and I'm a bit bored with the game. I would still gladly play the game with others to introduce them to this style of game and highly recommend the game to anyone.

Too similar to Forbidden Desert. The artwork and theme is more interesting in Forbidden Island though, and I like the fact that the tiles do not contain hidden information because the tiles in Forbidden Desert get damaged really easily.

Hand limit of 5 makes this feel really gamey because of forced discards almost every turn. Decision-making is very simple as well.

First and only Co-op I have played so far. It is really fun, but my gaming partner and I prefer to be competitive against each other rather than the game. Also, a few roles seem to definitely be better than some others = minor unbalanced issues in my eyes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is supposed to be Pandemic light.  The feel (hopeful alternating with stumbling anxiety) is about the same.  The playing time is about the same as Pandemic, at least in my family.  Although arguably FI is easier to win, it seems to me that it is possible to lose very quickly without having much say in the matter.  Things can turn south quickly in Pandemic as well, but usually you have a few turns breathing space at the start.  

I like that you can use the tile layout to vary the difficulty level of the game.  Some of the "official" layouts look very grim!

This one has seen more play in my house recently because my son can now join in who gets very excited when a water rise card comes out and it's generally a superb family game where everyone is involved and if your good enough everyone wins! Also even when we don't win my kids seem to enjoy the fact that the island sunk and we were all lost at sea!

It's an okay light game--Pandemic Lite, to be specific--that has the sole advantage of being quicker and easier. It would be a '5' but for the fact that you can probably get this to the table more easily with a reluctant crowd. It's okay, but I'd rather play Pandemic.

It does have nice artwork, especially on the tiles. The insert is well-designed. The box is attractive. The theme is light but well-chosen. The length is perfect for what it is. And you can easily play it solo. Despite its limitations, there's a lot to like.

My son enjoyed our play a lot and really got excited and tense as the island started to disappear.  The turning over tiles became a bit repetitive and there are few actions to do, and it was not always clear if all used cards go back in the decks, but it was easy enough to learn and play.  Maybe mother will have to play as well.  Anyway, we won a close one on the 'normal' level on the first try.

RATING: 9
We've played this numerous times in large groups and two-player co-ops. This is a great game where "the island is trying to kill you!" Movements, actions and strategy are completely cooperative - and engaging. Everyone has their special skill that they can employ to help the team. With careful coordination and skill - it's possible to find a solution and path to victory. The mechanism is pretty solid with various degrees in how to make the game tougher. That alone can help make the island more challenging as we try to save the artifacts and fly off the island successfully. 

We're a big fan of co-op games and Forbidden Island did not disappoint!

[u]16-Jan-2013[/u]:  In terms of dollars-to-fun quotient, this may be the best game I own.  It's a "lite" version of Pandemic, where you take on the roles of adventurers trying to escape a sinking island with four found treasures.  I love this game for its artwork, components, simple rules, and family friendly fun.  I even enjoy playing this gamy by myself.  The theme is stronger here than in Pandemic, I believe, because of the aesthetics of the game...lots of nice pictures on the tiles and the large plastic treasure figurines are great.  And all of this for like fifteen bucks (USD)!  And easy recommend for family gamers.  You can even check out the forums for additional island set ups for lots of variety and even more challenge.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]:  I know this one hasn't hit the table in several months, but it remains one of my favorite games.  It's a light, not-too-thinky, and fun co-op experience...solo and multiplayer.  With the additional island layouts that can be found in the forums, you've got that much more fun packed into this small, inexpensive tin of a box.  I still feel this is the best game I have in relation to my gaming dollar spent.

Bought on special at local bookstore. Came in a nice tin and everything, and heard so much about the game... I just simply couldn't stomach it in the end.

If you have kids - buy this game.  My six and eight year old love it, and I love playing with them.  Another game with great components (and I am a sucker for great components).

Lots of tension when those tile start sinking.

Need to get this back to the table sometime soon, but i will almost always choose a competitive game over a coop.

[I'm essentially pasting the same review here that I used for Forbidden Desert]

This and Forbidden Desert were important gateway games for our family and so they will always have a special place in our hearts. Island is less complex and a little easier than Desert, but both are games we've been able to play with our girls for a few years (they are 9 and 12 now)--though they can sometimes prove taxing for them if they are not in the mood. 

My wife and I, however, also play two players and really enjoy it. In fact, we will play multiple characters, throw in some house rules, and just have fun. I'm excited to get my "game board" I found on Etsy to help keep the tiles in place and class up the joint. 

Ultimately, we love co-op games, and this is a good one that is a great gateway to more complex games.

Easy mechanics of rules not very thematic. Both equate to easy pick-up for non die-hard gamers.

Nice packaging (metal box), miniatures (4 treasures), tile island pieces and cards with nice pics. Good quality production although the characters can be nicer if provided as miniatures instead of colored cones.

As mentioned, gameplay is easy to pick up, fast pace (normal game finishes in about 30 mins) and co-op. Objective is to get all 4 treasures and escape the island alive. 

An element of randomness in terms of drawing the flood cards though but this somehow adds to a certain degree of predictability in the game midway through in terms of the probability of win versus losing. However, replayability is pretty good although it isn't that challenging after a few plays.

I played on Christmas eve with my nephew, niece and sis. We won 2 and lost 1. Mid-way through the game, we are already aware of what is the most likely results and it seem really hard to reverse it. Possibly, there are games played by others whereby it isn't so predictable but those I played isn't so.

Like many co-op games, this one can be dominated by the "leader" types, so if you have one of those (or you are one yourself), remind them (or you), to make sure that every player needs to get involved and make their own decisions (some help is good). Makes for a much better experience that way.

I'm a fan of it.  It's a game that is extremely easy to table-captain, which I expressly try NOT to do.  For what its worth, I like the fact that the game has a scalable difficulty which makes it so it usually is far from a cakewalk, assuming you win at all.

I originally rated this game an 6. But it is what it is. It's a game I can play with my 7-10 year olds that they really enjoy. For that, it's fun enough as an adult. It's no Puerto Rico or Power Grid, but it's fun enough for what it is. The kids love it and never get tired of it. In that sense perhaps it should be rated even higher than an 8 if it gets my kids into playing games.

Really good cooperative game! The theme of the sinking island is nicely rendered and you do need to work with the others players. The more players, the more challenging the is!

As many others have said before, it is really a Pandemic-light. However, it is definitely easier to bring non-players to try this one than Pandemic which looks more "heavy"

RATING: 7
After playing Pandemic 100+ times, I was soooo looking forwards to this; and sooo disappointed. The choices seem much more obvious than in Pandemic, and the game lacks the same level of tension.  I really hope I have missed an important rule somewhere.

Update: I think we had a particularly easy first game; later games have had more tension, especially with 4 players; also, my eldest daughter (Clementine, 9) loves it!

RATING: 7
Co-operative game themed around explorers collecting treasure from a rapidly sinking island. Players negotiate their way round a randomly generated island made up of 24 tiles collecting cards which ultimately can be cashed in for a specific treasure. As play progresses the tiles become flooded and then ultimately sink below the sea, making it a race against time to collect all four treasures and make it to the helicopter pad and off the island. A nice filler game which takes no more than half an hour to play. Will be enjoyed by children of all ages; all cards are face-up so you can help younger children to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's an excellent game for what it is - a lighter, simpler Pandemic. The movement is simpler, and the game still has unique roles and a few event cards. The artwork on the tiles and cards is gorgeous. It's a nice entry-level/family game.

Fun! Simple, but exciting. The tension when the island starts to submerge is very nice. The game has lots of clever ideas, and looks really good. Fun family game. I, however, don't usually feel like playing it. My son likes it, and I will play with him, but otherwise, I'd pass.

A dos en nivel legendario es prácticamente imposible. Ganas de probarlo a 3 y 4 personas.

A nice, light co-op game; fun but forgettable.  I give it special mention, though, as one of the best gateway games I can think of, in multiple senses of the word.  For non-hobby gamers, it's a good gateway into more sophisticated stuff.  For those who only play competitively, it is a great taste of co-op.  And for younger gamers especially, it is a nice transition into more complex games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like to use this game to make younger kids (3+) feel included in a game for all ages. As with most cooperative games, older players can still help (table captain) the younger children, but still empower the individual with their special character abilities and make them feel included as part of the team. Lots of High Fiving along the way!

I'm not generally a fan of co-ops these days, although if asked to play, I will usually oblige, and even have something resembling fun. Good company is still good company, no matter what's on the table. 

The good thing about this one is that it's short and simple, and easily learned by kids and non-gamers, which makes it a great choice for a family game. At the end of the day, though, even for a family game, I'd still rather play something competitive.

Quite accurately described as 'Pandemic Light', Forbidden Island is a cooperative survival game in which players work together to card handle and threat assess the sinking island whilst rescuing treasure and making their escape.

Its simple and easy enough to teach, and plays very quickly. It works as a great filler, and is an excellent gateway game. Its non-gamer difficulty means it will be immediately playable to almost anyone, and it is widely available even in mainstream retailers such as Waterstones and The Works.

I personally much prefer its follow up game [thing=136063][/thing].

Good gateway family game,  but I prefer Pandemic base game over this . Too simple for my presences, but easier to draw others into gaming with. 

I prefer this to Forbidden Desert though as the later just adds levels of complexity losing the simple elegance of this design and making it somewhat less accessible and fun for younger gamers.

RATING: 6.9
Good entry level co-op game. The rules are really simple and difficulty scales quite well even for more hardcore players. This is a game you could even play with children or your familily but the only problem is that it is too easy for one player to "solve" the game on it's own. To have fun you have to give opportiny to your playmates to make some decisions (which are sometimes wrong) by themselves.

For me, the game became boring quite quickly and I probably won't play this in serious gaming groups no longer. But with my family it's a fine game.

A nice twist on the "Pandemic" style cooperative game. It works well and there is just enough actions you can take to hold back the floods! I would prefer to play with the "waters rise" cards shuffled into different sections of the pack instead of shuffled into the entire pack to spread out the disasters more evenly. A great game nevertheless!

Forbidden Island is a simpler, earlier implementation of Pandemic. If you have the sequel Forbidden desert or Pandemic the only reason you might want this is the younger family friendly nature of it or if you enjoy the theme. That's not to say it's not an enjoyable game, but a pass for me due to pandemic being in my collection.

The game itself is played on a sinking island made up of tiles, on your turn you are trying to shore up the island while collecting treasure and helping others. It's a lot of fun but can sometimes end very quickly with bad luck in the card draws!

This game is a kid friendly version of Pandemic. While the game mechanics are very similar between Forbidden Island and Pandemic, the two games with accompanying themes are different enough to make owning both well worth it. Forbidden Island is a little lighter, but can be equally challenging. The theme appeals to kids and adults alike. For the price, it's hard to find a better value game than this.

Already own Pandemic but played this first as a friends copy.  Great 'version' of the game for kids, but if wanting a game for an adult audience then buy Pandemic. Both great games.  Ignore the fluff about dominating players - assuming you have some other strong personalities around the table - it should create discussion. If you are the game owner and playing then make sure it does.

Nice artwork on the cards, even though you don't "feel" the different cards - yes they have names but you are interested in Fools Landing and all 8 artifact cards only. Roles are cool, but right after 3 plays with my GF it feels i'm done with the game:)

RATING: 6
Simple and elegant co-op game that is both easy to teach and generally proves to be tense near the ending.  After enough play throughs it becomes a bit too repetitive, so keeping your play throughs limited to a few times per month or more helps keep the game fresh.  There is a means to increase the difficulty by increasing the water level.  However, I found that it poorly increases the difficulty by making it go from a some what challenging experience to impossible win.  Over all a great game that is a must own!  Plus, the pieces are super well make, hardy, and well designed.  I think this game cost me $16!  Worth every penny!  For a more difficult experience, try Forbidden Desert!

Excellent to play with kids. One of our favorite cooperative games. Quick and fun, with great graphics and easy to understand rules. When playing with smaller kids, we throw out the maximum hand size rule, and just let them collect the treasure cards. Another great game from Matt Leacock, who is probably my favorite overall game designer!

RATING: 7
This game is a lot of fun, and we've had a few exciting adventures. However, it does seem to be really easy to beat. We started at the easy level and worked our way up, most of the time we ended up with a mostly complete island. When we finally put it to the hardest difficulty we finally started to have a challenge, but that still isn't saying much. It felt like we only lost because of bad luck. Our fist card was Fool's Landing, the next was Water's Rise, and we lost: in one turn. Still, I enjoy the co-op play, and we still have fun trying to solve a new puzzle every time.

Can't get over how pretty the tiles are, the gameplay is superb, fast and simplistic but always very tense.  Great family friendly coop.

UPDATE: 01/01/14

Okay, this is kind of a cheat too because I haven’t played much of the actual board game in ages.  However, it deserves a mention because I have played loads of games of it on the iPad because it plays so quickly.  I probably wouldn't break it out in ‘real life’ unless I'm introducing new players/kids – it made a great present for my 8 and 9 year old nephews for example.  I love the simplicity of the game and the theme, the artwork is absolutely beautiful, and I just think it’s really a perfect little game.  I don’t know why the Forbidden Desert theme doesn’t really do anything for me, I guess it doesn’t seem as exotic or interesting somehow – if they were movies I’d be more interested in seeing Forbidden Island than Forbidden Desert.  I guess I should give Desert a go sometime.  Maybe it’ll make another nice present for my now 9 and 10 year old nephews…  But yes, Forbidden Island will remain in the collection as a gateway game should the need ever arise to introduce somebody to gaming this way.  If it comes to game night though, I’d much rather play and get my teeth into something meatier.

Rating for young people (8-15) and beginners.
Game is easy to explain and start with beginners, and once the first turn is played, all are hooked in and trying to cooperate in order to win.
Tension rises as playing tiles diseappear underwater and usually victory or defeat is a close call.
Also I noticed young people just love to flood/dry tiles or use helo.
As an adult, I would rate it at 6 after a few plays.

We burst into tears the first time we beat this game on the highest difficulty. It may have been the best moment of may married life to date. My kid refuses to play it because the tension, whether the game goes well or badly, is simply too much for him or indeed for anyone to handle. This game should be retitled Anxiety Island and should come with a guide to the CBT techniques you'll need to master after playing it a couple of times through.

This is the first game I've spent 10 minutes on the instructions before sitting down to play with the whole family, including an 8yo who didn't want to play at all.  Within 5 minutes everyone was engaged, and we all stayed riveted until the end.  Then our son wanted to play again.  Then he took it to a friend's house to play.  All within 24 hours of receiving the game.

Great little co-operation game.  Played 2-player and is refreshing having a chat in the game compared to a good many non co-op games (eg  Multi player solitaire games - Ticket to Ride, Dominion, Kingdom Builder).  

Seems like a lot richer version of Hey That's My Fish (tile removing game that our 6-year old likes) with more options and rich play.

Being competitive, I never thought I'd like a co-op game but now I'm looking forward to trying out Pandemic and Hanabi.

Ironically, I prefer this solo over co op.  I dislike holding back in co op to stop my alpha gaming. I also dislike a little bit of the maintenance and order, but its simplicity and speed is nice. I also love the theme, components, artwork, and streamlined play in 30 min

Played mire and surprisingly enjoy this a lot more than any other co op Ive played. Its relaxed, light, fast fun. Theres replay in different role combinations and map tile setups. With a decent or good group, its fun and ends faster than Pandemic with arguably same level of luck. Not same level of decision making but easier for beginners to understand and better theme.

I also like how modular it is with official variant board layouts and treasure ideas. Will print when I get the chance to avoid the game getting samey.

I like the game quite a bit but have recently found Legendary very feasible to beat, even with some alternate maps. I still like this more than other co ops, but I wanted something more - some story/additional challenge/thought/abilities for every tile. I still prefer the art but have gotten a bit too used to it, so its impact has worn off. I like that its not as fiddly as other co ops and its probably my fave co op still, but I'd rather play a competitive game atm still.

I guess cooperatives truly aren't for me.

After playing this more, I still think this is probably my favorite co op at the moment, but I am a little tired of it. Its rather simple and easy to win and the variant layout doesnt add that much replay since its the same actions. I think I need a bit more thinkiness and not as much obvious plays which this occasionally has. I also wish more tiles could do more things and it could be a bit less finicky. I guess co ops arent for me. I also feel like its not an exciting that many request over and over and typically have average sessions of it. Also, for gateways, I guess I can use other games like Splendor or so. Trading.

Co-op play was defintely a new concept in board games for some of my players, but this seemed to go over pretty well. We played on "Novice" and just barely made it off the island.

A very nicely balanced cooperative game.  It has tension, luck, skill and teamwork all wrapped up in a game that also has beautiful artwork and packaging.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]+[/b][/COLOR] There is a lot of excitement that goes around in this game. Constantly worrying about what tiles are going to be flooded or removed can make every card draw intense. Hoping that the next treasure card isn't a "water rising" card, or that the next flood isn't the fool's landing tile keeps people on the edge of their seat.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]+[/b][/COLOR] The theme does shine a bit in this game. Because tiles are constantly flooding, even right after they're drained, it feels like Atlantis sinking in the ocean. Having to have a helicopter card to escape from Fool's Landing is also pretty cool.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]+[/b][/COLOR] The different characters are pretty cool, and call for a decent amount of special interaction.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]+[/b][/COLOR] The game scales pretty well, I played it with 2 and with 4 and enjoyed it both times. The downtime isn't bad at all, as you're constantly watching other people's turns to see what could be done to help you or the team.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]-[/b][/COLOR] Like most co-ops, it can feel a bit like the game throws random events that can't be avoided under any circumstances, but you can avoid these things most of the time through careful planning.

[i] Final thoughts: Pretty good co-op. I'm not usually a huge fan of co-ops, but this one is rather enjoyable.

I'm not a huge fan of co-op games (until I recently played Pandemic Iberia), but I enjoy them from time to time. This is a nice game that my (non-competetive) wife likes. But that's mainly the reason why I play it though. I like the artwork and the theme is OK. But at the same time there's something missing. Maybe it's the tiles and how they are layed out that gives the game an abstract feeling. I don't know. Or maybe that it's not that hard. Or maybe both...

Solid cooperative game where you're trying to gather treasures on an island that is sinking into the sea.  It's a good alternative to Pandemic if you want a cooperative game that's not too heavy.

[WrenniePennie's Copy]
This is one of the best starter co-ops on the market. The player roles are great, and the variable difficulty level adds increasing tension for more experienced players. However, once you basically know how the probabilities work, the game becomes very easy to defeat even on the highest difficulty setting. The alpha player problem also rears its head.

RATING: 5
Made by the creator of Pandemic and it shows. If you know how to play the one game, you know how to play the other; they're that similar. Forbidden Island has a more satisfying endgame though.

Forbidden Island is such a simple game, that it is probably too simple for veteran adult gamers. Feels like a kid's game. Not sure if it is possible to lose if everyone is working together. Very easy to explain to new players.

My recommendation is give a copy to your kids or sibling's kids and never turn down a request to play it.

Hay quien prefiere el Pandemic, que es considerado el hermano mayor. Gráficamente es más informal, adecuado para jugadores más jóvenes, pero es también más atractivo. 
La mecánica es trepidante, más sencilla que Pandemic lo que lo hace un cooperativo ligero y agradable para todos los públicos.
Es para jugarlo con personas que no pretendan imponer su voluntad porque hay que buscar entre todos un consenso y estrategias. Los novatos al principio no aportarán mucho, pero en la 2ª partida ya saben cómo va.
Sentirás la tensión de ver cómo la isla se hunde a tus pies, garantizado :D

RATING: 6
It's a pretty good value for the price.  On the plus side: The components, art, and overall production value are fantastic. The gameplay is easy to teach and involves some strategy and tactics.  Works well with all player counts, even solo. You can snag it brand new for under 20 bucks, and the box is small enough to slide easily into your collection.

Unfortunately, there's just not enough here.  The strategy is too simple, and satisfying decisions are rare.  Much of the outcome is dictated by which cards come out and the initial layout of the board. There can be some tension when you're having a rough game, but I've still not lost it in 5 plays.  Just feels like it gets played out fast, and isn't even THAT fun the first time through.

Perhaps still worth keeping around as a gateway cooperative game.

I like more Pandemic (and especially now with the expansion), but Forbidden Island is a nice step to play with family, and components are awesome!

I don't usually like cooperative games, but this one is quick, simple and fun. Plus the set-up and different roles provide a bit of variety. I'd still usually pick a competitive game over this, but with family or non-gamers this is will get to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I played this after Pandemic, so that is probably why my rating of this game is below a 7.

Forbidden Island has amazing components and it feels cool to play, but it just feels flat when you just got done playing Pandemic.

Don't get me wrong.  I'll play this game.  I'll play it whenever someone is like: 'What's that tin there?' and I'll get all giddy about it.

6.5 isn't a rating for a bad game.  It's a rating for a game I don't actively push for my group to play, but I'll play it and have a smile on the entire time.

Have a light group of boardgamers or want to show those clue and monopoly/vanilla board gamers what there is beyond the Target/Walmart shelves?  Then show them this.  It's super cheap [cheaper than monopoly!] and plays in a fraction of the time and offers an adventure feel for all your friends and family.

RATING: 8
Streamlining Pandemic and choosing a less dire topic for family play leads to Forbidden Island - a collaborative game with open information (i.e. a multiplayer solitaire) where players have got to rescue four treasures in an island before in sinks in the ocean.

The plot is realised using very few elements - a bar for the water level, tiles for the island, the same amount of cards to make it sink and a few more cards to gather the treasures and provide some help (especially to flee from the island). The different combinations of tiles and setups (some of the island starts already drowned) give the game more staying power, and the different levels of play can keep it thrilling every time.

This is where Forbidden Island's main strength shows: with such a clean cut and such a friendly topic, at the end of every round when a half of the island is under water you can cut the air with a knife - accomplishing the task on time isn't easy, especially with four players, since all the cards are spread around and there must be more exchanges to gather the treasures.

[i]- Great gateway game for families, easy to learn.
- Accessable to younger kids since it's a co-op (I starting playing with my girls when they were 5).
- Beautiful components and great artwork on the tiles.
- The only co-op in our collection (we've gotten rid of Flash Point Fire Rescue, Forbidden Desert, Pandemic, Pandemic Dice, Pandemic Legacy and Robinson Crusoe).

Our first designer board game, this is the game that got my family and I into this hobby. This game helped teach my kids how to cooperate when playing games and not to take gaming too seriously. It also helped my kids to learn to lose gracefully, especially since we all lost![/i]

I almost purchased Pandemic, and then read about Forbidden Island.  Both feature cooperative play, but the theme and beauty of Forbidden Island won me over.  Although it's inexpensive (another plus!), the quality of this game is unbelievable: thick tiles with gorgeous artwork, matching cards, delightfully detailed treasure figurines, wooden pawns--and it all comes packed in a beautiful tin box!  The rules booklet is clear and concise, and play is straightforward.  It's easy to learn, but requires attentive coordination of effort to win.  The cooperative mode of play makes for a nice change of pace, and it's also very well-suited to solo play.  (3+3) solo plays: 3

A very promising, relatively easy-to-learn family game in which players habitate an island that's sinking, and sinking fast at times. Players must work together to share cards in order to survive. Endings can take place with nail-biting tension. Played this with my sister, a real gamer, in July 2013 and she rated it an "8". Played it with her again in mid-2015 and then we taught it to my wife, and with repeated plays I raised my rating from 8 to 9, as I just think it's such a smart design and the theme really comes through.

Excellent game! Initially when I bought it I read too many reviews of this game and became persuaded or maybe even jaded into thinking that this was just Pandemic. I actually felt like I did not like this game that much upon our initial plays. Well, we gave it a break and played later on when the mood was right and I found I do enjoy this game in its own right. 

This game is rich in theme and enjoyable to play. The components are really outstanding and the artwork is stunning. A great cooperative game of getting the treasures before the island sinks. Sure the mechanics are the same as another game, but that doesn't matter. Good solid mechanics and a fresh new theme completely change a game experience for it's players. 

Also, there is a wonderful set of Arts Cow cards that really make this game even more fun to play. The set includes many new roles, new tile layouts and a traitor variant.

Everybody like Forbidden Desert better.  But this one holds a special place in my heart -- this little gem is what brought me to the table of modern games.  And in truth, I'm not certain but that I think the island sinking mechnism has a little more tension to it than the rising dunes.  As the dunes rise, you always have the feeling you COULD dig if you needed to, but with the island, once a portion is sunk, it's gone.  So, yeah, some people will say if you have Desert, you don't need Island -- I think there's room for both.

RATING: 8
This has been well received by family and gamers alike as a co-operative venture, where you get to jointly overcome the game rather than compete against each other. And there's no accidental about it - you *have* to co-operate to win by sharing and consolidating the treasure cards you pick up into one person's hand. Turns are generally straightforward - you're moving around (each tile is an action) to get next to a flooded (flipped) tile and undo the flood (because if it floods again, you'll lose that tile) or you're moving to someone else's spot and giving them a card. Once someone gets 4 of a kind, they trade it in on the right tile for 1 of the 4 treasures. Once you have all 4 treasures, everyone get to the home tile and play a helicopter card to win. So the game is all moving, flipping, sharing. It's easy enough for smart 7 year olds to pick up, and good for family, although it can be hard for kids to kick the competitive habit and truly understand that it really doesn't matter who saves the treasure without the need to get sulky. A good result is dependent on your ability to not have to spend actions moving, instead saving them for card sharing and flipping / saving tiles. It’s especially so at the harder levels. And this will depend on how the treasure cards come out (you want each player to receive just 1 type rather than each type being split amongst everyone) and whether the flood tiles are close to you or further away. The more you play, the more you realise your result is a function of this card distribution. The available actions are limited. The interesting and challenging choices that those used to the dynamism and broad possibilities of Pandemic may expect are not there, so it certainly doesn't replace it on the shelves. But it can be fun if everyone plays in good spirit. It creates some tension along the way and offers a nice sense of satisfaction when you succeed. It has its niche, and it racked up 10 plays in a matter of days so I’m starting this as an 8, but I could see it dropping to a 7 over time as we continue to do all the right things and become slightly disillusioned with the luck.

"Excellent light pure co-op. Great for non-gamers, but still interesting to me after 20 games."

What I like:
- Fast, fun, easy-to-teach co-op
- Inexpensive with beautiful components

What I don't like:
- Can be pretty random

We played our first 5 games incorrectly, so those are not included in my recorded Plays.

One of the first games in my collection and for that alone there will always be a place in my heart for it. I used to adore the tin and laughed at the haters, but as my collection grows I find myself turning against tins more and more every day.

A fan game if you don't take it seriously.

To me it is basically a one player game that is boring to play alone. If you prefer it is an exciting puzzle for a group of people to solve together, but the "players" thing is a joke. You could play it alone, you could play it with ten of your friends. 

Other than that enjoyable, light, very easy to get into for ANYBODY, but should be used as an exciting filler. No chance inviting friends in order to play Forbidden Island. 

I feel that this is a great game to play with kids. The mechanics is almost exlusively kids oriented in my opinion. (That's my main problem with pandemic, it has kids mechanics but it tries to be an adult game). 

The most irritating feature of this line of leacock games is that the game doesn't end only when the island sinks (or when the whole world is hopelessly infected) it can also end when you draw a predetermined number of Waters Rise cards (or when the players deck ends for Pandemic). In my opinion this is a preposterous, cheap and extremely unthematic trick that makes me mad every time I think about it. I mean how can the water rise at a level of drowning everyone, while at the same time there are parts of the island that are perfectly dry. 

The next worse thing about the game (also present in pandemic) is that no one (except for the person guiding other players) has the feeling that actually plays his character and that his actions matter. In forbiden island I can see an adult peacfuly guiding children and letting them have fun. But I can't help from laughing when I see experienced pandemic players trying to be polite while patronizing other adults and trying to hide their pain when an obviously bad move is proposed. 

- "We could do that, OR MAYBE it would be better to do this and this and this and then Mary will do this and this and the other and then it's my turn again"
- "OK, let's do it that way, and then we can play a game that I can be a part of."

It remind's me when a friend of ours told us that we can have a shooting contest with his Dad's hunting rifle, but because it will be dangerous he would take our shots too. And then he started shooting going like this: "Now I am shooting for me, now I am shooting for Nick, now I am shooting for Paul (and so on)"

That is why I can see this game only in a non serious-kids context.

Great artwork and great quality of the island tiles (although cheap treasures)

(Wife's Point of View: She finds it completely boring)

Unforgiving doesn’t even come close to describing this game; you won’t beat it very often, unless you play on the easiest setting. I like the fact that it plays quickly and is easy to explain, plus the tension that builds up as the island disappears beneath you really adds to the experience. The components are very nice considering the price. It’s worth picking up to add the extra money to get free shipping on an order.

I have only played twice solo. Its fun and things do get tense as the water level rises. However on the first few turns you do nothing more than move around shoring up tiles. Some plays with more players may cause me to raise my rating on this one. 

Edit, raised to an 8 now that I have played it with other people. Had two very tense games where it came down to the wire. If we had one more turn we would have won the game.

RATING: 5
Forbidden Island really does seem like Pandemic for people who can't handle Pandemic (whether that be kids or non-gamers).  Here, you're trying to collect four artifacts by amassing four cards of the same color in your hand, with the usual Pandemic rules about drawing and trading cards.  The tiles that make up the game board can become flooded and then removed from the game, when the "water rises" cards, which work just like epidemic cards in Pandemic, come up.  Like in Pandemic, the key mechanism is that the cards get stacked back on top of the deck and are likely to be drawn again.  However, in this game certain locations are more important than others (particularly Fools Landing), and if their associated cards come out early, the game will be much harder.  Furthermore, I found that there was generally less to do on your turn.  I'm not a big fan of Pandemic to begin with, and this game is definitely inferior.

Sounds like Pandemic-lite.

OWN Dec/11.  Played 3x on Jan 1.  Disappointed that we won all 3 times fairly easily.  I need to try with 2 players on Normal, or 3/4 players on Elite or Legendary.  I suspect this was meant as a 2p game; rules should make it harder to stash so many cards in players hands (or the island sink faster) with more players.

Or maybe we just got lucky setups.

RATING: 10
Simple rules, fast-paced play, and beautiful artwork on the  "board" combine to make this a favorite of ours. Given how simple it is, there's a lot variation from one game to the next due to the different initial set-up of the island and the different player roles. We've found that it gets distinctly harder with fewer players, as the limited number of treasure cards you can hold in only two hands means you  frequently have to cycle through the deck repeatedly to get matching sets of four.

Cannot say enough about this game.  Probably rated too low.  I always forget how much I enjoy this game until I pull it out and play it again.  Taking it to family game night next time because last time we took Forbidden Desert, and while they caught on, the deeper mechanics were a bit much for my family.  (We are only just now introducing them to the real depth of board games, until my wife and I pulled them into the hobby the only board games they knew were the Monopolies, Parcheesi's and Sorry's of the world).  We figured out too late Island is a better gateway game while still being enjoyable for more advanced players.  Plus, it's co-op, my favorite genre.

This game has been great with young children, who really take to the idea of playing a game where everyone wins or loses together. The kids really get into the theme of escaping a sinking island. The components are fantastic. 

The first of two possible faults would be that the game can be susceptible to one player taking charge. This might be fixed by a "no bullhorn" policy where players whose pawns are isolated by two squares cannot communicate with other players. The other complaint might be that the game is too easy to beat, but that's easily fixed by the fan-made variant island shapes.

Forbidden Island will stay in my collection, and gets a lot of plays, because it's a fantastic way to introduce new players to cooperative games.  There are far better games employing the same general mechanics, but they are too heavy for kids and nongamers, and they are discouraging.  Forbidden Island is light and, at normal difficulty, quite beatable, so it'll be my go-to "gateway game" for co-ops.

At client site (3 copies) used for training on team dynamics now...

I gave this to my son for his 9th birthday; this is incredibly good.  We (just the two of us) played Novice and won, but half the island was gone, so not sure I'd call it an easy victory.  It actually is well balanced, in understanding the game play, you will get the water rise cards more often with more players and have more coordination to pass cards to the right players needing them as you add more players.  Captures the feel of Pandemic in a more kid-friendly format.

The true entertainment is in the nail biting drama.  Could be a truly solid gateway game for that reason.

This is definitely "Pandemic Light" but that's not a bad thing. I'd often rather play this than its bigger brother. It's a simpler, lighter, and faster game. It replaces the familiar virus outbreaks in Pandemic with an island which dynamically sinks, one segment at a time. It's usually nicely timed such that the team is beating a hasty retreat to the helocopter just as things are falling apart all around them. It's easier to win, though to my mind that makes it less frustrating, and the shorter investment means it's less annoying when you lose.

This is a great introductory cooperative game, which I'll pull out to teach to friends or family members that don't play many games.

There is a tremendous amount of unavoidable randomness. I prefer games to end with the feeling, "I wish I had done this differently," but every game of Forbidden Island merely ends with, "I wish this had happened differently," typically related to the random drawing of Water Rises cards. Having played two games last night, the first game literally lasted three turns, when we drew back-to-back Waters Rises cards causing Fool's Landing to become submerged. We won our second game but there was no sense of accomplishment, just "Oh, we didn't get randomly screwed this time."

Besides that, the amount of agency each player has on the game is practically zero. You can go for a 15 minute smoke break and come back and see what players have decided for you to do on your turn. Perhaps in this way it's a "true cooperative" game, in the same way Solitaire could be a true cooperative game. But I strongly prefer cooperative games like Hanabi where players are forced to make their own decisions.

The second game I ordered, it is a good Co-op, but I've played Forbidden Desert, and this one is a but lighter than Desert, so it doesn't get played a lot. 

I like it and it is a good gateway game, but it is not getting played and I'd rather play Flashpoint! or Pandemic.

A little less complex than its big brother "Forbidden Desert" We picked this one up on vacation at a tiny little FLGS on an island. Haha, but true. 

It plays well. I think it would work better with younger children than Forbidden Desert because it's not quite as brutal. As you sink areas of the island, their cards cease to have an impact. The longer the game goes on, the more of the island sinks and the greater the number of "reprieves" you get from random chance. So While Forbidden Dessert tends to accelerate and bear down on you as the game goes on, Forbidden Island tends to attenuate and almost help you get across the finish line. Although life is not like this, it's probably not a bad thing for playing with kids who might not understand the fun in having a game pummel you into the ground ;-)

RATING: 8
Pandemic's little brother. But a little brother stepping out of the shadows. I love the Pandemic style of game, a mixture of set collection while sticking your finger into the dike. Forbidden Island can be more appealing than Pandemic in a number of ways.

1. Less set up time.
2. Simpler (Lily is able to play it and understand what she is doing and why she needs to do it).
3. A bit less stressful. My God, Pandemic can get your heart racing to unhealthy levels.

Pandemic-lite is a bit unfair, but it's the best way to describe and to also explain why we like it so much.

This is a great little game at a phenomenal price point. I think I would still prefer Pandemic with an older, gamer crowd. But when I'm playing with my kids, the theme and simplicity of Forbidden Island will win out every time.

Very light, fully cooperative game. Perfect for a dispair team of players. It lends itself a bit for "Leader" mentality where a dominant player can attempt to drive everyone elses efforts, so I would really not recommend this for competitive players. I like to play this when I want to rest for a little bit of time with my wife. Not more than 25 minutes per session and it really distracts you enough without being overwhelming. All this should probably make you realize I do thing this is a great family game.

Surprisingly fun. A quick coop that doesn't take too much brain power. Made by the same creator as Pandemic, which is both a blessing and a curse. While it's got solid mechanics, the mechanics feel entirely ripped from Pandemic, so it makes Forbidden Island feel like Pandemic Lite - Which is not entirely a bad thing. The closest thing to a "filler" coop I've found thus far.

A simple lightweight cooperative game. It's a good cheap title to introduce people to cooperative games but that's about it. Cooperative games all have the same problem where a dominant player will basically lead the game by himself and try to optimize everyone's moves. In effect the game ends up being a single player game most of the times.

Very cool co-op game where the game tries it's damndest to beat you. Strategic and very hard in an enjoyable manner. Those times I have beaten it have all involved epic tales of heroism. The sequel, Forbidden Desert does the same sort of thing with a different flavour and very different, though recognisable, gameplay. Island is probably the better game to introduce people to the idea of co-op play, Desert is going to give you more fun in the long run. Comes in a great tin and has very cool components.

The theme of this game is great.  The island you're on is sinking fast, and it's a race against time to finish your mission and escape with everyone and everything before you all drown.  A coop game for up to four players, but can be played well with only two.  Excellent components, all very well crafted and the artwork on the tiles is beautiful.  Well worth the $15 price for what you get.

Very much "Pandemic-Lite", but charmingly so.   Yes, it lacks the depth of that game - but is so much easier to teach and lighter all around.   It still manages to maintain tension and enjoyment.  Perfect for as a gateway game or for those times you want something lighter.

Although lighter and easier than it's big brother Pandemic, I still prefer this. The theme is much more to my liking.

Solo, it's ok but not great. Like most coops, I feel that part of the fun is in the discussing with other players, and you lose that solo. It's also not that difficult to beat once you figure it out. You can up the difficulty, but then you just start losing due to randomness instead of poor decisions.

It's kind of a bad combo of simplicity, difficulty, and lack of versatility. We've played it a few times through with primarily the same group of people, and I feel like we've more or less exhausted the strategies available to us to win the game using the small variety of characters and extremely basic objectives. It's difficult enough to maintain a bit of a thrill in simply trying to stave off failure, but it doesn't get played nearly as much as it did within the first few weeks of buying it.

RATING: 7.5
I really enjoy the changing map. It adds an excellent variety to a game that might otherwise have a memorisable solution. The changing roles also add a nice dimension of variety to the game (though some of them are next to useless - I'm looking at you, explorer). My main criticism would be that a lot of the game is decided once the roles are dealt out. A game with the diver and explorer, for instance, is a lot worse off than one with a pilot and messenger. I do have fun, though, and it can get exciting once everything starts going wrong.

I played Pandemic early on in getting into the hobby, and was really impressed by the mechanics. But I soon decided I'm not a big fan of co-ops, especially after a painful game (my first win!) where we were bossed around by an experienced player. My mother-in-law picked up Forbidden Island for me in the Borders liquidation sale, so I gave it a go, and it really does merit the description of "Pandemic Lite". The mechanics are still clever (though not as clever as Pandemic), it's faster and it should work better for non-gamers. I don't like the theme nearly as much though, and this has left the collection now.

It forces tough decisions and changes in your plans.  Plays super quick too.  Each game feels tight and tense and a lot of fun.

7.5 - I played this and the other 2 Matt Leacock co-op games, Forbidden Desert and Pandemic, and found this one to be the least stressful and most manageable game of the three.  There is lots of time if you are careful and work together unlike pandemic where if you don't keep a close watch on the player deck you'll run out of moves.  The board is less chaotic than forbidden desert with it's constantly shifting tornado.  I find this game very enjoyable and the randomized layout makes the difficulty vary from game to game and it has many of the same elements that the other two games have.

My favourite first-level gateway game that is a much lighter version of its famous cousin, Pandemic. 

Forbidden Island serves as a good introduction to the cooperative games genre and the easy to understand rules, interesting theme (treasure hunters who have to steal 4 priceless artifacts from an ancient, mysterious island before it sinks), and never a dull moment during play make this a lovely game. 

Some people say it lacks replayability, but I disagree. One just has to find (or devise) variant tile layouts (which represent the Island's shape) and each game is new with a different set of challenges.

This is a cooperative game that keeps things concise. Its art is awesome and the rule are easy to understand, and it 's on the short side. Everyone I know has had this experience: the first few times, they absolutely love it. Then, after a couple of plays, they figure out a few key tactical principles and the strategy evaporates, as each turn's best play becomes easy to identify and the game becomes dull. I have hope that some of the fan expansions on BGG will revitalize this one, just be aware of the possibility that this game will burn bright and then flame out.

Forbidden Island needs a few more whirls on the table. New layouts have helped it enormously. Enjoyment is very dependent on the group playing, but when it all clicks it is a great coop that escalates the tension fast and very easy to teach (looking at you, Pandemic). THE ideal first cooperative game for the neophytes.

First co-op game I've ever really played and it ended with a nailbiter, choosing a card that would end the game, or avoiding it and escaping with our lives.

Have yet to try the more difficult settings but until then I don't think it will receive higher than what I've rated it because there doesn't seem to be all that much more to it than a pick up and collect co-op game. 

And co-op games... If you have an aggressive/type A gamer in the group is never fun.

Great and simple design, Forbidden Island simply isn't challenging or interesting to me in the decision making as it is far too easy to know what the correct moves are. But, it was a fun little puzzle to solve originally, and it still is an easy game to get family and non gamers to give a try with. I prefer it's cousin Forbidden Desert for a more challenging experience.

Having heard that this was a lighter Pandemic, I didn't have high expectations. I also didn't expect to lose our first game, even on Elite difficulty. While it may be simpler than Pandemic, Forbidden Island still requires careful strategy. It also has a wonderful theme that won't turn anyone off (like infectious disease might). While I don't think I need this in my collection as I already own four Pandemic titles, Forbidden Island is a winner and I doubt I'd turn down a game.

Disclaimer: I'm not a huge fan of cooperative games. That said, you can probably guess that I'm not a huge fan of Forbidden Island. There's not a ton I can say about the game, since the danger escalation mechanic has been done a lot. I'd usually rather play something else, but if this is the new hotness of the evening and must be played, it's not like I'd walk away from the table.

RATING: 6
I prefer this over Pandemic.  I like the theme and also the core mechanics which are essentially the same as Pandemic without all the bookkeeping and fiddlyness of the orginal game. We only played the normal difficulty and barely made it so there is plenty of challenge still to come. Hardcore gamers and strategist will probably find this underwhelming but I think it is a good light/family game to have in the collection.

This is just a stupendous family/casual game! It plays so nice, the theme and components are top-notch, and the price-point is fantastic. Kudos to Gamewright for strething their normal games to include this one, and making it affordable so it is an easy recommendation.

Another co-operative game with a lot of the same underpinnings as Pandemic.  The production quality is attractive, and the rules are approachable.  If Pandemic is too challenging, but you want to like what is happening in that game, Forbidden Island has a much more approachable goal and shorter playing time.

RATING: 6.9
This was one of the first games I was eager to get because of how impressive it looked in a tin. Not only that but how diverse the idea of a sinking island and you had to save the jewels and artifacts. Indiana Jones at its finest. It's a simple game with a few decks of cards. One determines the tiles which sink.Another determines which artefacts are going to be rescued first. And lastly there are the cards which determine when the island sinks. Very similar in mechanism to pandemics Epidemic cards. These happen to be called Waters rise. It's a very tense game from start to finish and thoroughly enjoyable too. The pawns could have been nicer. But that's just picking. Worth playing.

Honestly, as much as I want to love Co-op games, I only ever just like them. I love losing to people but hate losing to a system. And they are all made so hard, so you're bound to lose a lot. That being said, while I don't think this game is up to the complexity of other Co-ops; for me I actually enjoy this game as much as those because it plays really fast. This game plays in thirty minutes and I can play it with my kids. Solid game; nothing to write home about, but does hit the table and gets the blood pumping as the island starts sinking.

Only a few plays so far. Gets a six. It's quick, easy to get into, and plays neatly. Just feels a bit random, and a bit "samey." The limited options available to each player each turn didn't engage me as much as games like Ghost Stories.

A good family game.

Further plays may change my opinion.

I'm not a big fan of co-ops, but this one avoids the pitfalls of painful co-ops such as Battlestar Galactica by being: a. short (30 mins), b. traitor-less and c. capable of turns without rabidly long discussions/arguments. My daughter loves it, the tension is high and, well, it's over in 30 mins. Great fun.

RATING: 7.3
Fun cooperative game.  The rules are very simple and the game doesn't take long to teach.  My 9 and 7 year old sons can play and offer decent strategic input.  Despite the simple rules, the game can be quite challenging, and it allows you to vary the difficulty to your liking.  There's a decent balance of luck and strategy involved in this game.  And there's a decent amount of replayability here, since the island and the role cards will generally be configured differently each time you play.

Forbidden Island has a feeling very similar to Pandemic, if you have ever played that game.  Several of the mechanics are very similar.  But Forbidden Island is a nice alternative because it plays faster, and I think the rules are a lot easier for children to comprehend.  This is a game I definitely don't regret purchasing, especially considering its reasonable price.

RATING: 7
Nice game which can be described as a simplified Pandemic. Very nice for playing with kids starting at the age of 6.
On the other hand it has some inherent issues, the major one is the fact that you can lose in 1 round with no way to avoid it in the case where you lose your helipad.

Considering that this game sells for $10 - $15 I think everyone should have it in their collection as an intro to co-op games.  I just wish it came in a box and not a tin. I will only play on the Elite level.

Forbidden Island is a slightly more simplistic version of Pandemic (a big favorite of mine).  In this case, adventurers are attempting to obtain 4 treasures scattered about an island that is slowly sinking beneath the waves and escape from the island.  Anyone who has played Pandemic will be familiar with the mechanisms at work here, so if you enjoy Pandemic you'll like Forbidden Island.

Things I like :
-In general, nice components.  There are 4 cool "treasure" pieces that kids (and adults) will enjoy.  Tiles are solid as well, and the whole game comes in a nice tin.  Cards aren't quite as durable as I would like them.
-The basic mechanism of the game.  I enjoyed it in Pandemic as well.
-Quick play time.  Plays a bit faster than Pandemic, which is nice if you have someone with a short attention span for games.  Could also use it to teach Pandemic.
-It is a low cost game.

Things I don't like :
-it is, pretty much, the same game as Pandemic except simpler.  If I am in the mood for this type of game, I will likely just play Pandemic instead.
-As I mentioned before, I wish the cards were more durable.

Bottom line, I think Forbidden Island is a good game, but there isn't much there for someone who already owns Pandemic.  I think it is a nice game to play with children or adults who aren't into longer games (or maybe find the disease theme too depressing).

Co-op intro: 8/10
Normal game with adults: 5.8/10

Great for kids or as an introduction to cooperative play. Very simple to explain and play but with enough strategy to keep adults interested. 

I started playing with my 4 and 5 year old (who are now 5 and 6) and they were able to pick up a good portion of the key strategy. There are several roles (diver in particular) that add more depth to the strategy.

Not something I'm ever looking to pull out unless I want to teach someone co-op games or get kids interested, but it's great for both of those situations.

25 of my plays have been solo. I was certainly a bit addicted to this game for a few weeks. Even worked up a half-baked variant I named Forbidden Archipelago! I cooled a bit, but recently played a few games and still had a fun time. Enjoyable game, plays quickly, easy to grasp the rules, lots of variant possibility both with the rules from the box and via fan ideas.

I've enjoyed my solo plays. The variant island layouts and multiple starting difficulties add a lot of replay. I'm hoping to play through (and achieve victory on) at least the 10 official variants and then possibly moving on to some of the various fan created (or maybe make up some of my own) islands. I think I've played 6 of the official islands so far.

Elite is probably my favorite starting level. You get two full runs through the Treasure Deck before the possibility of flooding out which gives you a reasonable shot at victory. Legendary is also fun, but there is a much greater chance of an average to poor luck shuffle dooming you no matter what you do.

The one play with others was at my FLGS with three other experienced gamers. Surprisingly I didn't like it as much as I have solo. I think it's because I was playing new games that day and having a lot of fun doing that. With a different group (family or more casual) I expect this will truly shine.

If you played Pandemic and didn't like it don't bother with this. If you played Pandemic and liked it (and why wouldn't you, its excellent) then don't bother with this.

Players search a sinking Island for a four hidden treasures while it sinks around them. Treasures are claimed by forming sets of four cards of the same type. Each turn players move, claim cards, and a bit more of the island sinks. Critically all the players work as a team, this is like Pandemic a true co-op. However, where Pandemic is very carefully balanced all the little nuances are broken away here, so the game is massively dependent on luck, there is little relationship between the board and hand, with players really just waiting around to see if they draw the right cards.

If Pandemic didn't exist this might make a light fun game, but given that Pandemic does this isn't worth playing.

This is a very quick co-operative game.  Great entry game to show non gamers that there are other board games beside monopoly.  Couldn't play this all the time, but its a very good filler game.

I know this is more of a "Pandemic for the masses" but it still doesn't feel as substantial as it could be. This is always a strong risk of having a bossy player take over the game. I probably should give it another play or two.

Fairly average "gateway"-style light co-op game - and I can't get excited about such a game. Very similar to Pandemic in play, but I actually slightly prefer it - it's a little cleaner gameplay-wise, and with much prettier components. But I would never choose to play either.

Our first cooperative game, my SO was happy to have something we could work together on rather than me just letting my competitive side get the best of me.  We started the first game on Novice and my SO initially expressed concerns that the game would get stale very quickly.  We upped the ante on the second game to Elite starting water level and almost immediately decided that this game is awesome.  We finally lost our third round when we started the game on Legendary, but boy was it close.  The tight constraints of the sinking island mixed with cooperative strategizing really makes this game amazing.

+ Easy to explain co-operative game, very much a gateway to the genre
+ Good quality pieces

- Light but almost too light to have much replayability, I would personally recommend Flash Point: Fire Rescue over this if you feel the need to fill the "pure co-operative" category in your collection or Pandemic
- Essentially a singleplayer game because one player could just be overly dominant and tell everyone else what to do
- Tin will get permanent dents in it over time, I'd prefer a cardboard box

Forbidden Island is a great game for younger audiences, or people you're trying to get into more complex co-operative games. The game is fun, easy to play, has surprisingly beautiful artwork (and box!) and doesn't eat up a lot of your time for game night.

The easiest way to describe the game is by calling it 'Pandemic lite'. Players take turns moving around a sinking island, trying to keep it afloat through various actions. At the end of each round, the player draws 2 treasure cards which could be one of 4 treasures, a few actions, or a 'waters rise' card. Next the player draws flood cards equal to the current water level, flipping over the island tiles that become flooded, or removing already flooded tiles from the game. Players win when they turn in 4 matching treasure cards to collect each of the game's 4 treasures and escape the island, and lose if the locations to claim treasures or their evac point ever sink.

Overall, Forbidden Island might have a hard time holding the attention of gamers used to more complex titles like Arkham Horror or Pandemic, but is a great game for slow nights, kids, and friends who are just getting into cooperative gaming.

RATING: 10
What can I say about this game that is bad? Almost nothing.

Highest quality pieces and tiles and cards of any game I have ever touched. 100% best quality pieces. Even comes in a nice TIN!!

Cheap too, oddly enough. 

Our first co-op game. Still love it. I have no complaints. Once you learn the rules and mechanics, there is nothing complicated. Good for many players or just 2. 

Seriously, the only thing to say bad is that the game could have had more variants and a boggier board, I guess. Also, after like 20 games, I don't feel like playing it much anymore. That is common, and will probably change though.

Some of the grooviness of this game though is how compact it is while delivering a full size game experience. I love showing this game to others. It is a permanent part of our collection. One of the best games ever made IMHO.

Recently I played Pandemic. If you like Forbidden Island, you will probably like Pandemic. Forbidden Island is quaint and smallish and beautiful. Pandemic is more like risk mixed with Forbidden Island. Both fun co-op games.

Some call this "Pandemic Light" which is appropriate in many ways but I think it is better than Pandemic in some ways. It is very portable, easy to set up and offers more variety between games with the random placement of the island tiles. My wife also likes this game better than Pandemic so it is more likely to make it to the table. Personally, I would rather play Pandemic but I am happy to play this as well.

Amazing co-operative game. I love the challenge of keeping the tiles from completely sinking while collecting the treasures and trying to fly out of there. Good range of difficulty options. With the varied setup of where tiles are and which player abilities are being use, I can continue to get fun, interesting plays out of this game. I still like it better than the similar game, Forbidden Desert.

Foi o primeiro, e por enquanto único cooperativo que joguei. Curti bastante a mecânica dos tiles afundando, mas esse tipo de jogo exige muita disciplina dos jogadores. As jogadas têm que ser individuais, pra que todo mundo possa lidar com a burrice alheia. Se elas forem fruto de um consenso, além de a sua presença ser dispensável, fica muito fácil vencer.

Worth a try just for the Waters Rise! mechanism.  Restacking the recently sunk tiles on the top of the flood deck is inspired, even when it leads to an instant-loss of Fools Landing.

Granted, that's not so much fun if it happens on turn 1, which can be a real damp squid. Squib.

Play with kids or just for quick laughs and try not to take it too seriously.  Helicopter noises when you win are mandatory.

I wasn't a big fan of this one. Games like this and Pandemic annoy me that you can have a whole group of people playing together to reach a common goal and just have one overbearing person making most of the decisions which is allowed by rule.

My niece loves this game. It plays a bit like Pandemic without all those cubes. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If you know Pandemic, you can see the genesis of this game in that one.  If you don't, here is the cooperative race against disaster but in a much more family (and kid) friendly format.  Instead of diseases and outbreaks, the island is getting flooded and perhaps disappearing.  Players/Explorers race to collect 4 treasures and fly away.  Things that make it simpler - fewer ways to lose and those that are there are easier to track.  (No outbreak upon outbreak sucking up the cubes, no outbreak death count) and the treasure deck is reshuffled, so bypassed cards can be gone after later in the game.  A fixed number of disaster (Waters Rise) cards, so can play safer if all are gone from the deck (prior to reshuffle).  And once a treasure is achieved - those island tiles can be sacrificed as necessary.

This game is pretty simplistic now that we've done some other co-ops.

If you don't already own this game, do yourself a favor and add this to your collection. It's a co-op game so my family found it incredibly easy to play this one and loved the communicating and formulating strategies with each other to accomplish a common goal. Also it's easy to imagine the suspense of a fictional island sinking around you as the game comes to a close. Awesome game!

I only rate this game so high because my kids really love it. For me it's just an ok experience. I can't play more then once in a single sitting. Playing deeper more complicated games with more a lot more strategy has spoiled me. However, if you are looking for a solid family game you can do a lot worse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The very cool thing about this game is that it's cooperative - that is, you're not playing against each other, but together against the game itself. In this case, everyone is trying to unearth all the treasures and leave the island before it sinks into the ocean. I'm not against competition, but I think there's a real need for this kind of cooperative-style, non-competitive board game. That said, my one complaint is this (and it's probably unavoidable with any cooperative game): it's very easy for one person - usually me, if I'm just playing with the kids - to "hijack" the game and dictate what the team strategy should be. But we all love to play it.

RATING: 4
Fairly simple cooperative game in the same vane as Pandemic.  You are  a group of explorers trying to gather artifacts and escape the island before the island sinks into the water. Each turn more and more parts of the island start sinking getting more difficult as the game goes on. Players have to work together to make the best moves possible with each players individual abilities. 

Pros: Easy Gameplay. Interaction with other players a necessity. Quick Gameplay time. Fast set up

Cons: simplistic gameplay does not offer a lot of different options. Difficult to play with players who take over decisions for the group.

Theme?  Ancient treasures, foolhardy adventurers, a cursed island rapidly sinking into the ocean depths...check!  

Production?  The components are astounding, and demonstrate Gamewright's strength as a publisher.  The tiles and cards are of good stock and gorgeously illustrated with colorful, diverse, evocative landscapes, giving each tile its own flavor and identity.  Finally, the treasures themselves are nice, chunky plastic and look amazing!  You will actually want to succeed in the game so as to acquire them....check!  

Gameplay?  Though it might be too simple for some, Forbidden Island is a fast, fun, exhilarating cooperative adventure that stresses group hand management and proper planning.  It is prone to the Alpha Gamer problem, but that's dependent on group dynamics.  The flooding mechanism is rather clever, and brings genuine suspense to the experience. The race against the clock is exciting, as you try to gather all the treasures, get to Fool's Landing, and get off the island before you sink with it!  It just makes you want to succeed as a team!....check!  

This is one of my favorite games, and it coasts pretty heavily on its awesome theme.  Aside from being insanely affordable ($15 or less), this is a perfect introductory co-op, simple, quick to play, and a great time for all involved.  Works very well with kids.

Bought from a flee market. I like the theme better than the desert one's. I think this plays easier/faster, because you know where to get the items (once you have the cards) and no moving tile rows. The location of the item tiles seems like it can make it easy or very hard. Kids liked the first game - with us it's kids' game.

Kids really liked this game, having to choose priorities to save certain parts of the island, which cards to keep, which cards to use in the appropriate moment. Then as the island is almost completely sunk towards the end of the game, the tension of actually making it off the island, is the next 2 cards drawn going to contain the helicopter or waters rise? 

Adults will likely find that decisions are fairly obvious, so may want to progress to Pandemic which offers more options. This makes Forbidden Island very much a family game for younger kids.

Artwork on tiles and cards are just awesome, the treasure pieces are cool to look at with a lot of detail, I wish all games were produced at this level. To add the icing on the cake, its not that expensive to purchase... Wow, a good game with nice graphics, nice game bits, nice game play, and kids enjoy.... what's not to like?

Finished with 3 tiles remaining and one water level below the skull and cross bones for the win.... Exciting stuff...Well done.

Pandemic stripped to its bare bones. A lot easier to explain and quicker to "get it", and much easier setup, but less depth and immersion (since most of the time, it's just, on your turn, unflipping tiles that were just flipped). The modular board and flip/unflip are cool, especially the latter, which looks more dramatic when compared to Pandemic's 1-3 cube threshold. But the great loss to me is Pandemic's accessible and gripping theme.

You know what I mean. The best part about this game is the challenge. This game is so well constructed!! The challenge and reward of surviving the Forbidden Island is way too much fun. To this day, it's one of my favorite games and very sentimental. The perfect game to start your tabletop spree. The theme, challenge, co-op feel, and addiction make this a GREAT game.

While she didn't fully understand all the nuance of the game she loved flipping tiles, collecting treasures and didn't cry when we lost.

Forbidden Island -- 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pandemic lite. 

the good: 
- It retains the main AI mechanic of Pandemic which put both the parent and the child quite ahead of competition. This AI makes planning possible as player are not just reacting against the game. 
- art is nice and makes the game more approachable for target audience (teens, families)
- time frame being shorter also makes the game far better for the mentioned audience.  
- with 6 roles in the base game and island being modular, there's quite a lot of replayability. 
- AI deck getting thinner as the game goes on is clever and makes the game tenser and tenser. 

the bad:
- well it's harder to keep track of which areas are more likely to be targeted than others as there's only 2 states of an area (normal, flooded) before it's drowned  as opposed to 4 states in Pandemic. FI is therefore not as strategic as Pandemic. But has it's own challenges. 

the ugly
- Playing Schmidt version. The card stock far too thin. Yes the game is cheap to buy, but I'd prefer they left out the 4 statues (that do nothing) for a better card stock. Unlike Pandemic these cards need to get sleeved.

- Slovene translation is one of the lamest jobs I've seen. Here's what they've done: they used normal colour laser printer (probably in their office) and printed card translations on normal laser printer stickers. The quality is not bad, it's terrible. I'm not sure there's a worse paper available, so colours bleed and it's hard to read the text (which is even smaller than original). Even worse, the person who did the graphic part of this translation was either grossly underpaid or amateur (or both) as they didn't even bother to find the font which has Slovene special letters included. 
And there's also a rulebook which is: scanned original, white lines put over the original text and new text on top (same printer, same quality). And the translations are in some places so literal from German it makes no sense ("prostor neuspeha"??? - gre za helikoptersko pristajališče/ploščad).

good co-op game really love the look of it. I liked it so much i bought the next game Forbidden Desert. They are the same game almost but the rules and play got better in Forbidden Desert. So we sold off this copy and keeping Forbidden Desert.

Oddly we prefer this to the successor. Despite the fact Forbidden Desert feels like a more intricate design, the simplicity of Island (no faffing about with sand) works for us.

Great as an introduction to co-operative games.

A great filler that doesn't require brain burning decisions.
Although it will always get the occasional play, I found the [url=http://www.artscow.com/gallery/playing-cards/forbidden-island-variants-l26l0q8wb3ir]variant deck[/url] from artscow increased the replayability immensely.
I would definitely recommend it for solo players.

[3 plays] Fast and easy, friendlier version of Pandemic. The components are very nice, and this will be a great co-op game for family fun.

Most recent plays 10-23-10 with Garrett, Drew, and Ruth then 9/1/13 with Garrett, Ruth, and Etta. Most recent play Sept '14 with Michael and Corey.

RATING: 8
Pandemic-lite. In a good way.

Great gateway game for kids. It's a co-op style game where players have three actions to move their characters (each with individual skills) around a board (comprising tiles). Objective is to gather four-of-a-kind cards to claim four treasures before getting off 'Forbidden Island'.

Some of the tension is lost because cards get recycled (unlike Pandemic) and it becomes an exercise in waiting for the right cards to turn up while stemming the flooding of the islands.

Great for kids but trades the tension of Pandemic for a lighter, easier system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love this game. It's a fast, fun, friendly, and easy co-op that's small, portable, and fast to set up. The only downfall of forbidden island is that it's pretty dependent on the amount of players; i.e. you're pretty much guaranteed to win with 4 players, but with 2 on a high level it's impossible and entirely dependent on the cards drawn. This game would also be really good for an entry-level gamer and is very teachable. Considering how cheap Forbidden Island is, the quality of the components is really good.

RATING: 6
A fun, light cooperative game. It was one of the first games we owned and was a great gateway into the hobby. It is a little too simple now, but the set collection and trading of cards does add a nice level of stress to each game, and all games do seem to come down to the very end before getting off the island. I would happily play this game with some new gamers or with some kids, as it is very easy to understand the rules. The main issue is that there are just a lot of other games out there that take 30ish minutes that are a lot more fun that Forbidden Island.

It is what it is.  A light, cooperative game.

This is definitely a unique game for its purely cooperative element.  With up to 6 players all working together to achieve the game's goal of gathering for ancient artifacts before the island sinks provides an atmosphere during play that is much more naturally than any traditional game of forced competitive interactions.

The downside (or maybe the upside for some) is that FI is exceedingly simple... almost simplistic. But it's entertaining in a light way for about 30-45 minutes.  Well worth it as an intermission game in your regular regime of more strategic entertainment and quickly learn-able by almost all ages. Take a break from bashing at each other on Forbidden Island.

Initially I thought this was a great game, however, I think a lot less of it right now. The general structure of gameplay, a). do several actions, b). draw 2 cards, c). make the world a worse place, is borrowed from Pandemic. This wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't feel so similar on the basic level. Even though you're not curing diseases but shoring up tiles, both games start to blur until at some point you're just saving yourself from losing, however it's called. 

The people that I could recommend this game to are parents of young children or people who want to introduce their friends to board gaming. This is simple enough to be easily explained to pretty much anyone. On the other hand, it lacks the crunch offered by Pandemic and after a few games, you'll yearn for something more complex.

Ghost Stories és Pandemic közös gyermeke szinte szó szerint. Mindent a szüleitől örökölt és lett egy kis fiúcska, ami annyit tesz, hogy igazi kis egyszerű családi kooperatív játék született. A GS-hez hasonlóan különböző szerepű karaktereink vannak, akik a GS-hez hasonlóan mozognak az egyes térképlapokon csak átlósan nem. A célunk egy sziget 4 kincsének megszerezése annak elsüllyedése előtt. Itt jön képbe a másik szülő, minden játékos kőre végén adott mennyiségű áradás lapot húzunk, amivel helyzetünk lesz egyre nehezebb. Mindegyik karakternek van valamilyen speciális tulajdonsága, talán ebben a játékban kevésbé éreztem, hogy nagy különbségek lennének köztük, mint esetleg a Pandemicben. Nagyon egyszerű, talán az eddigi legegyszerűbb koop játék, amivel találkoztam, így családdal is bátran játszható, sőt főként velük, mert nem igazán megterhelő egy-egy köre a társasozónak. Nagyon gyorsan lemegy egy parti, mi kell még? Semmi új ötlet, de kellemes darab.

Decent, light co-op.  Good art, quick to learn, and scales fairly well.  It mostly depends on the "most threatening cards return to the top of the deck" mechanic, which is fine, but maybe over-utilized in co-ops (cp. Pandemic, maybe Yggdrasil, etc.)

Forbidden Island is by now a classic cooperative game that was one of my early introductions into hobby board gaming. It borrows a lot from one of Matt Leacock's other coops, Pandemic, but is lighter in theme and price. If you're trying to bring in new player to hobby board gaming, this is an excellent starting point. The production is excellent, despite the annoying tin, and even though this game has been lost underneath a glut of newer coops, it's still one of the best and one of my favorites.

RATING: 7
I prefer to play competitively and I want to win against another player, but this game removes the player vs player aspect and replaces it with cooperation. I generally hate cooperation games but I played this game with a 6 year old and an 11 year old and they absolutely loved it. Instead of getting crushed by an adult (remember, I play competitively - and I make no exceptions!), we all got to work together, planning our next move and we won. I would have tossed the game otherwise, but since kids were so happy, I decided to try the game again with my girlfriend. Same result - I was lukewarm, but she was delighted that instead of getting killed in another game, we won together! Like it or not, this one's a keeper, if only to keep the kids and the girlfriends happy.

Rating after one play.  I feel bad about giving this game a 6, because it really is a pretty fun little coop.  The word "little" is the problem, though.  It just felt like there wasn't much there, especially when compared to Pandemic.  This game is very similar to Pandemic, but Pandemic isn't so much harder than this game that I can think of a situation where I wouldn't choose to play Pandemic over this one.  However, maybe with more players and higher difficulty I will like it better.

I bought this to play with my 6 1/2 y.o. daughter, but after playing it with a group of adults, I think I'll hold off. The cooperative aspect drew me in as my daughter really dislikes losing right now, but the special roles  combined with the oppressive doom will likely turn her off. I may give it a shot with her as it is a very pretty game. EDIT: We tried on the novice setting 9/4/10 and beat the game with a couple of rules errors. I let her choose the pilot and I randomly "chose" the Engineer. We had a great time and I think letting her choose her role made a great difference in her enjoyment.

We LOVE co-op games. My husband and I are highly competitive so it is nice to feel like we don't have to "fight" other players and have our ideal win scenarios "foiled". 

The drop-in, drop-out groups we play with tend to be somewhere in the middle between casual and hardcore. Capable of appreciating and understanding rules more complex than Milton Bradley games yet don't have the time to play games like Eclipse and Twilight Imperium 3. This game hits the table a bit because of this reason alone.

While not as good persay as Pandemic, it has a few enjoyable difficulty twists. Once we even lost the game before it started because, well, the waters rose.

I love the idea that the island is constantly sinking... we were having a blast scrambling all over the island trying to secure the relics. The theme was fun too... I am a sucker for Indy Jones type stuff!

This game is a great value.  For the price, it's a great game.  It's easy to set up, easy to understand, and has good replay value.  When we only want invest a small amount of time in a game, this is the one we pull out.

RATING: 7
Much more random and chaotic than Pandemic, but I also find it more fun. The endgame is particularly more exciting, as you have to escape off the board as the playing area rapidly shrinks, as opposed to the game just suddenly ending when you cure 4 diseases.

Yeah, yeah, so it's basically Pandemic lite.  But I prefer it to Pandemic because it plays more quickly, the tension is just as good, and the game is less complex.

I 'love' the theme of this one - The threat of the island itself sinking is fantastic and I love the rapidly decreasing size of the island throughout a play.

Sadly, the game is too light and you don't really end up with any interesting decisions.
 
Would love to see the theme re-implemented in a heavier coop though!

Too easy for two players with just one role each, even if you start out at a higher difficulty, but take on multiple roles and it can be a challenge. Would love to play this with more players. It seems really simple to teach as well, which makes it a good gateway game. Cooperative gameplay is a lot of fun and can bring needed unity, especially when we usually play against each other and are highly competitive. Haven't played by myself yet, but I'd like to try it.

A very solid co-operative game; very useful as a family or gateway game as the rules are pretty straight forward. It's quite involving although not deep strategically. It does represent a good challenge though.

Its ok, maybe a little better than ok.  I thought it would be good for younger players but it seems a bit too hard for kids, and a bit too simple for adults.  It's fine.

RATING: 5
1 play, solo (just about the only way I play co-ops), elite difficulty, 2 roles (Navigator, Engineer)

Nice simplification of the Pandemic system: easier setup for both the board (random configuration of tiles) and decks (just shuffle and you're ready to go!). Rules are also easier to manage during the game: 3 actions (move/shore up/give card/turn in a set of 4). And production is great, with a nice tin and cool little treasure minis. Unfortunately, that the completely random draw deck, where Flood Rise cards can now clump up and appear in rapid succession right from the start, makes success even more dependent on luck of the shuffle. The inability to take cards limits you as well, such that sometimes there's just no good option for an action.

I can see that this might be quite good as a family game or as an introduction to co-ops. But it's just not for me (keeping in mind that I don't like co-ops anyway, this is as a rating for the solo game).

Haven't ever played Pandemic or any other coop game, so hopefully this will be a decent introduction. I know it gets knocked for being too "kiddy," but the price is right.

Edit: I've played the game twice so far-- one "solo" using four characters, and one with my parents and brother.  Granted, these were both learning/teaching sessions, but on the whole I don't know how FUN the experience actually was.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice looking co-op - game that so far was never as tense as I wanted it to be, not sure why it is only "nice" for me, I think I would like more complexity in it. Due to the changing board and different character qualities the replay value is high though. It is not too long which can be nice, too. So far, it is too easy to win, unless you start on a higher (much higher) water level it comes too simple I think. Who knows, maybe it will fully grab me one of these days?!
Works pretty well with two players, seems harder and more intense with more.

A great co-op that's a step down in complexity from Pandemic, but with just as much tension and stress. Suffers from the same problem as Pandemic, where a bad card draw can take you from safe to dead in one turn, but is over in half the time, so if you die, you can just play again!

In my opinion, this is the best faily co-op game around. Because it's co-op, it's easily playable with younger children (say 5 ages and up) and they simply love the experience. The game is atmospheric and exciting; it has about everything you could possibly want in a good family game. For seasoned gamers though, Forbidden Island is just a dumbed down version of Pandemic.

So as a family game, I would rate this a 10 and as a game to be played with fellow gamer, this would be a 6.

First cooperative we played - fun for all

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating this is one of my more interesting dilemmas.  Normally I have no problems with rating games designed for adults and rating games designed for kids, and each catagory I rate with entirely separate criteria.  If a kids game is brilliant, I'll give it a 9-10 even if it would be a 2 with adults--if my daughter's play with our family and her friends warrents a high score it will get a high score--after all, no adult should be fooled into unsuspectingly playing a kids' game.  It's unfair to rank a kids game by adult standards, and BGG is sickenly rife with just such problem scores.  

But herein lies my problem for here is a game which is primarily for 'adults' with its ages 10 and up rating, and yet as a game for adults I'd be hard-pressed to ever want to play again, and the rating should hover around 4 to 5.  

It's (barely) tolerable, but really, there are hundreds of games in my collection which I would bring out to play on game night before this one.

Yet, at the same time, played with my daughter, fully 3 years under the recommended age, it's not only tolerable, but fun.  She brings a visceral excitement to the game which, for me, is utterly lacking intrinsically in the play.  With her in the game it easily ranks a 9 or even a 10...I would not turn down a game with her, nor even try and steer her to a different selection.

So the upshot is, if unlike me, you actually enjoy playing against a random system and not against other thinking players, if you covet that time with you and your friends against the designer's spreadsheet, well you'll possibly like this...although fair warning it is very simplistic if you compare the 'system' against something like Battlestar Galactica or Arkham Horror.  

And right there lies its gift to young kids, because it is very much like those games, only simplified to a state that they can make solid, informed decisions, and contribute greatly to the game themselves without being led by their elders.  And yet it doesn't play like typical kids-game fare...caught up in the children's excitement, you don't notice how pointless and boring it might be if the next card sinks your only chance at the wind-statue, even though your play may have been perfect, because well, the luck of the draw entirely determined it and there's nothing you can do about it.  No, instead you find yourself caught up in their tension to see what the next card will bring, in the edge-of-their-seat excitement to see whether they shored-up the right card on their turn.

This game is a 9.5 if played with young kids
This game is a 4+ if played with gaming adults

This is the first co-op game I played. The rules and playing steps seem too complex at first but that is not a problem to have the excitement from this game. I like that the cooperative spirit and management skills of players are important factors in order to win the game (to get four treasures out of the island before it sinks), unlike other games that players almost kill each other before game ends. Also, game varieties are multiple according to the difficulty level you set before game starts and different changing roles given to players. The game guarantees high replays and  beautiful graphic illustration that surely attracts young and veteran gamers alike.

I'm not the the biggest full coop game fan, but this one is easily my favorite.  It's less abstract than Pandemic and suffer less from the dictator problem.  The tension really builds up during play. For the price and production quality you can't go wrong; great job Gamewright!

RATING: 9.5
I just think this is a brilliant game for its audience. 

While there's no doubt that it's Pandemic's little brother, the (arguably) more engaging theme and components and the more transparent strategy make it very accessible as a family game.

While the strategic depth is lessened slightly, where it beats its older sibling hands-down for me is in its story arc. At the beginning, you feel like you can keep things under control, but as the island starts to sink, you really feel the tension rise, right up until the point where you lift off in your helicopter (sometimes off of the very last tile remaining in the island!). Whereas Pandemic sometimes ends with players saying, "Oh, we're done?", Forbidden Island has a very satisfying ending.

I love Pandemic, especially with the expansion, but Forbidden Island has earned its own place on my shelves, especially with its small price and short setup and playing times.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Forbidden Island is a changing puzzle. It has a unique feeling of urgency with the sinking tiles. I mostly like it because it works with a large audience and even though it is basically a puzzle, the set collection aspect gives it a good game type of feel.

I just received 'Forbidden Island' as a Christmas gift, and it is my first experience in co-operative board gaming.

After opening the tin, the first thing that stood out was the amazingly detailed pieces, cards and tiles. Fantastic artwork on the tiles set the mystical island location, and the pieces of treasure that are to be collected are handsomely crafted. You definitely want to posses these items!

After admiring the components, it was time to set up and play. I've now played the game with 2, 3 and 4 players, and each game was tense and exciting until the end. The rules are fairly simple and straightforward, and you can be up and ready for adventure in mere minutes. Each player is assigned a different role with special abilities. The "board" is also set up uniquely each time you play, adding to the replay value.

My favorite aspect of the game is that winning is not at all easy. Strategy and cooperation between players is necessary for victory, and even your best-laid plans can be thwarted at the last minute. There is one way to win the game: collect all 4 treasures and escape the island. However, there are 4 different ways to lose, and I've lost games by 3 of those ways. To give you a fighting chance, different difficulty levels can be set to fit your ability.

'Forbidden Island' has really gotten me interested in the world of co-op board gaming. There is a spiritual sequel to this game, called 'Forbidden Desert', which I am very highly considering as a purchase. The designer of both 'Forbidden Island' and 'Forbidden Desert' created the game, 'Pandemic', which is another game that is now on my radar.

A beautifully designed game with high-quality components and near endless replay value and excitement, 'Forbidden Island' is a great addition to anyone's board game collection and a great way to get initiated into the world of co-op board gaming.

People say this is a 'lightweight Pandemic'. Not sure why I thought that this was an unfair allegation prior to buying the game but it's absolutely spot-on. Some of the mechanics don't make quite as much sense here but the sinking island is actually quite dramatic and the game is still a lot of fun. Artwork is nice and the endgame is a nice little addition.

The first cooperative game I've ever played. One of my favorite games (seriously considering rating this a 10...it's that good!) and quickly becoming a favorite among my family and my playgroup. Game is quick to learn and fast to play. Some times your team succeeds, other times the board hands your team their heads on a silver platter.

RATING: 6
[Gamewright 2010 Edition] {Island; co-op, action-point-allowance; optimal 4p} {6: adults, 7.5: kids} Forbidden Island is a thematic fun co-op game for children.  Players work together to find 4 treasures, go back to Fools' Island and fly away with a helicopter.

This game is full of interaction and communication.  And this is fun.  Replayablity is not bad, but not a keeper.  So, it's good to buy it cheap second hand and then sell after plays.

It takes a while to explain the games to children because there are multiple action choices, multiple steps, and to warn them about the urgency of shoring up islands.

Difficulty:
- Novice for children, and then increase difficulty as they like challenges.
- Elite for adults.

The game components are nicely made.  The 4 treasures are toy light.  The game tiles are sturdy.  And the illustration is vivid.  The use of colour is good.  All these made Forbidden Island a good family / children game.

-- 
Compare to Pandemic.  Of course this is more friendly.  And I prefer this as the entry co-op game for children.  For adults, always Pandemic.

This is a great little co-op game that families could easily play together. We have only played with two players, but I think my Mom would enjoy this one too. I am still not sure how I feel about co-op games, so I hope to play more. (Pandemic, this means YOU!)

* Quick to learn and teach to others
* Great first co-op game
* Quick game play
* Suspenseful (we like to read the names of the island locations in extremely dramatic voices)
* Nice to look at
* Could definitely play with all ages

Wow, pretty nifty. It's Pandemic minus some stuff I didn't mind being removed. Won my first game on novice pretty handily but there were still a few almost-tense moments. The island layout was very favorable and it was a solo game so my partner was a pretty clever fellow. We worked well together.

When I raise the difficulty level (and get a tile shuffle that doesn't clump all the important tiles right near the landing pad) I'm sure it'll be much more exciting.

Looking forward to future sessions.

As a solo game for an adult, it's like a 15-minute puzzle if you play it on at least Normal mode with 3 or 4 adventurers. I will try this a few more times, but this probably won't be my favorite short solo game (there's too many great card games I can solo in 15 minutes).

I can see this being a lot of fun with kids, and it's co-op which is such a great way to play games with children. It's a mix of strategy, spatial awareness, and tension as the timer runs down. 

I want to try the Enemy solo variant at https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1553569/simple-enemy-variant. 

Also want to try some of the different map layouts and new role cards.

I introduced this game to my son was he was 8.  We had fun with it but he lost interest pretty quickly as we accumulated other games.

The game has sat unplayed on my shelf for a couple of years...just waiting for my daughter to get old enough.  She recently turned 5 and we just finished playing two games.  She needed some help (one of the advantages of a cooperative game) but she wanted to play again immediately after our first game.

It's a great introduction to cooperative games.

This was our first co-op experience and it's what got us hooked on this type of game. The kids love it and because we make decisions as a family they don't feel overpowered by us. When they make the decision that ultimately wins the game it gives them a nice boost of confidence.

Had I known Forbidden Island was little more than a simplified Pandemic, I would not have bought it.  It is still one of the better cooperative games I have played, and a much easier teach for kids than its predecessor.

Fun cooperative family game.  Dad tends to take charge of the team unless people object, but we have a lot of young players.  If someone disagrees or thinks something better they voice their opinion.  Teaches kids to work as part of a team and raise an issue if they disagree with something being done.  Good all around.

This is a streamlined version of Pandemic that is simpler, faster, and more fun to play.  The fiddliness of Pandemic has been removed and the game has been distilled down to its essence which, in my opinion, is a beautiful thing.

Leacock is the master of the "time is running out" co-op game, and while I love Pandemic, Forbidden Island is my favorite. It's so finely tuned that every choice you make is relevant. Variable board setup and number of players keep your strategies shifting. You will have as much fun losing as you do winning. It's that good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A well produced little co-operative game (great artwork, components, packaging). In terms of gameplay it's pretty lightweight stuff, although it is quick to play and it can lead to some excitement as the race to find the treasures and escape the island before it sinks heightens. It's a theme that's been done many times before however and the gameplay is probably far too simplistic for most gamers. More of a kids game really and I believe it'd appeal to children younger than the 10+ age suggested by the publisher.

I am a huge fan of solitaire gaming and lucking this game can be played solo. Having said that however, this game wasn't designed to be a solo experience so it suffers from feeling a bit like 'busy work' with having to control two players (like Pandemic).

Fun, light, co-op with great looking components, easy to learn rules, and a palpable tension as the island floods.

A Pandemic filler. I liked it - fills a Co-op Filler niche which is rare. Nice art on tiles. No art on roles though. Rules are easy to explain. I explained it in 5 mins. Cards were a bit of a cop out - there were only 6 card types for the Hero deck. I find that better in Pandemic; at least in Pandemic, you had the option of using a cure card to travel. In FI, "cure" or treasure cards are used solely for treasure which means that once someone has discarded 4 treasure cards to obtain the treasure then all cards of that type are now useless. I would have liked it better if the cards had more function.

The treasure tokens are amazing though. Anyway I suppose I'm just nitpicking at it. If Zooloretto came out before Coloretto, I'd be nitpicking Coloretto as too simple. But as it is, I enjoy Coloretto for its simplicity and think that Zoo is slightly overdone.

The kids love playing the 'sinking island' game though :)

UPDATE: The official Variant Island Layouts pushes this up from a 6->6.5

This is a fun very simple coop game.  I would not recommend this game for experienced players but if you want an introductory coop game which is light and easy to learn, there may not be a better option out there.

The biggest negative here is that once you have won it a few times, the game is not complex enough or adjustable enough to make you want to play it more than a few times.  You eventually feel like you either will win by default or if you lose, it is only because you got exceptionally unlucky, not because you made poor choices.

Played this for the first time last night with 3 people. It was great fun. All three of us walked away from the game with the feeling of having just experienced a "Indiana Jones" or "Uncharted" adventure. 

The game is cooperative, the players vs. the sinking island. I like these types of games, they provide a distinctly different experience from your standard competitive board game.

The one concern I have with the game is based solely on its core mechanic. The island is sinking. Quickly. In some difficulty levels, VERY quickly. The sinking is handled by random shuffle of a "flood deck" and then a  number of cards (2-5 depending on where you are in the game) gets turned up. Each card that turns up represents an area that becomes flooded, or sinks completely. This, by itself, is not a problem, but the board layout is completely random as well. Finally, there is 1 board location that has no backup location for its function, and is required to win the game. It is entirely possible for this location to be flooded when the game starts, and then sunk in the first turn. You need a very specific sequence of events and combination of player roles, but for all that I can see it happening.

Overall, I enjoyed the game very much, and it is a nice quick game to play with up to 4 people with. I would't play it with less than 3.

For cooperative games, this isn't bad, but nothing outstanding.  The repetition of returning the last flooded tiles to the deck gets a bit boring after a few plays.  You were rather explore the other tiles then be forced to re-save the tiles you just played on.

I would rather play Ghost Stories, which does a better job of adding variety to actions, and threats then Forbidden Island.

This is a very clever and tense cooperative game.  I like coop games in general, and this is a pretty good one.  The land is all sinking, sometimes at an alarming rate, which reminds me (in a good way) of Survive.  Working together is important, but the game doesn't have a clean solution to the "Alpha Gamer" problem that inherently exists in cooperative games, so watch out for that.

I've played a few times with my group. The idea of a flooding place while adventurers race to save artifacts and escape is fun and great for families. I find the strategy a bit simple, but it's a great co op game. IMHO it makes a trade off of leaning towards more of a family game, and not having enough depth to keep my interest at all times, and can pass slightly slowly (but still a quick game!). A great introduction to gaming and co op games, but if you're looking for more depth, try forbidden desert or another great co op game!

recommended for the girls.  very clever game design. coop with a fun racing feeling as the game progresses.  similar to pandemic but less rules.  each game is different depending upon which players are in the game (each with a unique ability) and how the cards are dealt making up the sinking island.

RATING: 8.6
It's very simple, and I'm sure its other renditions and spiritual partners such as Forbidden Desert and Pandemic have more to offer, but this is really my introduction to the system and it's surprisingly addictive. I did not expect to like it as much as I did, but there is something really fun and satisfying about the game. I really like the pace of the game as the island sinks and you struggle to quickly grab the treasure and fly away. I definitely want to try more Matt Leacock games after playing this one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

So much exciting fun.  Great cooperative family game.  Nail-biting doubt that the island will sink around you but enough power granted to be able to dominate.  Has scalable difficulty which is nice for when you think you're all that and a stack of pancakes.

What it lacks in strategic depth it makes up for with a suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat experience. It's satisfying even when you lose (which happens often). Ease of gameplay, quick play time and co-op experience make this a great choice to bring out with non-gamers. Another one-two combo that makes this an easy sell: fantastic components and an unbelievably low price.

RATING: 5
I picked this co-op up mainly because it's by the same designer as Pandemic, which I adore. This is a really great family game and it can be a lot of fun, but given the choice I'd pick Pandemic every time. The games are VERY similar, but there are enough differences to justify having both in your collection. Still, some of those differences make gameplay a little clumsy, and you can easily be stuck in scenarios which are quite tedious (mainly due to the reshuffled deck). I still like Forbidden Island pretty well and will keep it around, especially to introduce younger or new gamers to co-ops, but I probably won't play it very often.

This feels like Pandemic boiled down to its very essence. And while less complex and shorter than Pandemic, Forbidden Island is still a great co-op game, exciting to the end, and a good family game. Played this with my 6 year old once and now he's begging me to play again every day!

RATING: 8
Pretty much exactly what I had expected, Forbidden Island is Pandemic lite, with the core mechanics stripped down to ease complexity and a family-friendly theme added. For serious gamers, there's still plenty of tension and room for clever play, but the potential audience for this one now grows to include more casual players. Forbidden Island is quick, easy, has an appealing theme and components and succeeds on just about every level. If this had been released before Pandemic, I'd have said it's ticketed for a Spiel des Jahres nomination, but being so derivative of a title that has won so much acclaim so recently, I'm guessing Forbidden Island will be generally ignored in the awards category. Nevertheless, with a price of less than $15 (and probably less than $12 if you scout around a bit), I think the game will sell well for Gamewright, which may pursuade other mainstream U.S. game companies to take a second look at Euro-style games. In the final analysis, Forbidden Island packs a big punch for a small price, strikes a nice balance between gamers' game and gateway game and is well worth a try.

Short, challenging game that requires strategy and cooperation to win. Some luck and chaos too. Theme is rich. Bits are first class. Very cheap price.

Tons of fun. Playing time is about 30 minutes. For me, it definitely has that "Let's play again!" aspect.

About as complex as Pandemic overall but a little shorter. Besides their different themes, a key difference between FI and Pandemic is the board: will be different each game, and it changes during play so you have to adapt and keep your vital routes open.

Gamers should set the initial Water's Level appropriate to their skill level. The lowest settings are more suitable for play with families and kids.

Solitaire is very do-able. (See my session reports for rules variant ideas.)

Forbidden Island is now on my shortlist of best gateway games. I used to think Pandemic was Matt Leacock's masterpiece. But Forbidden Island tops it.

As many say, "Pandemic Lite" which has its pros in ease to learn, approachable theme, and game time 30-45 minutes. But the major con is that it overall feels lucky. To make the game harder doesn't mean you have to play better because your choices are fairly limited. The strategy space isn't very deep. Once you have found some strong moves and avoid stupid mistakes, it is just the luck of the cards.
Pandemic isn't so different but has more choices which partly means more strategy and partly masks this luck effect.

Rating after one play: Entertaining, but I do not expect much replayability. Light, moves seemed a little bit obvious. Feels a little bit more random than Pandemic because the "outbreaks" involve the complete tile of played cards. So a late flood is much less deadly than an early one. An early flood can easily destroy the landing space (ending the game) without any chance to respond properly in time.

This game is very easy. It should be for players age 5 - 10. This game is a little more difficult than Candy Land.  Seriously if you can tie your own shoes, your probably too advanced for this game. On a side note, this is a Mensa select game. I didn't realize how stupid the kids in Mensa must be.

There are not tough choices to make in this game. It suffers from one person telling everyone what to do (if you have one of those types). There is little reward in winning. There is not much replay value. I've had more fun watching paint dry.

I love this game! This was my first real introduction to cooperative board gaming. I love the randomness of the setup and the complimentary nature of the characters' abilities.

We've played this many times and there's still no sign of wear on the cards, the pawns, the treasures, or the island tiles. Excellent game!

This is Pandemic: Spiel des Jahres-edition. No really, it's a streamlined version of Pandemic. And a lean version of a game that already scales on the very light side of gaming, is a strong contender for the SdJ-award to me. I'd be surprised if this would not be nomineed. High quality components, easy rules, fast gameplay, very family-friendly and beautiful artwork. Plain good quality for your (little) money. Plus there's never been a cooperative game that won Spiel des Jahres. It's about time and this is a really pleasant representative of its genre.

A wonderfully tense, easy to understand co-op game that can be set-up, taught, and off and running in a matter of ten minutes.  My two daughters, ages 7 and 5, get quite a kick out of this game.  When played with gamers, I'd kick this game down a point or two, thought it is still a good enough game.

One of those games that can be played with non-gamers, and will likely be well-received.  It all depends on how you, as the teacher, are able to get the gamers at the table into the game.

People calling this Pandemic Lite may be correct insofar as there being slightly fewer complexities in this game, but it is an absolute mis-characterization to say this game is easy. As experienced Pandemic players, we played our first game on the Elite difficulty and lost. Not only does this game have all the challenge of mapping out turns and optimizing actions, it also has an engrossing theme with the island sinking and you desperately trying to keep afloat. This game was surprisingly good and I see myself replaying it many times.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Macinda

Why we culled it: Forbidden Island is a solid light co-op game. It sets up quickly, offers a bit of variety, and plays well with a group spanning a wide age range. It is susceptible to the classic "quarterback" issue common among team-based co-ops, and that problem tends to be exaggerated if you're actually playing with an age-diverse group. That said, the game is solid. I had the most fun playing it with my nephews, so when it came time to thin out my collection, it was a no-brainer to send it to them, where I can still play and enjoy on occasion.

+ Great artwork for the various locations and nifty little idols to collect. Very good production values for a $15 game.

+ Relatively interesting puzzle the first couple of times.

- Very limited decision space. There is either something obvious to do or it doesn't really matter what to do.

- Not really a game so much as a puzzle to solve together. There are only a few random elements, which make most decisions mostly calculable.

This game was fun for the first couple of games but there never seemed to be another reason to play it again. I bought Pandemic hoping it would make the game more complex/less calculable and gave this one to my mother to try and get her more interested in designer games. All in all, this is a fair amount of setup to get a game on the level of working a Sudoku together.

RATING: 8
Maybe I'll get tired of this one, but right now I enjoy solo or with others.  It has never failed to win favor with anybody I have introduced it to.

Do yourself a favor and order the Artscow cards designed by user, Grudunza(sp?).  They are FABULOUS and really add lots of variety to the game.  I am quite surprised that a slew of small expansions have not already been published with these, or similar, ideas.  They are top notch.

Update: Rating has settled down to a solid 8 and will likely stay there. Still a great, short experience for almost anyone. I will always prefer Pandemic, but this is a perfect quick fix.

Another observation is that this game may work even for people who don't like Pandemic. Sometimes all of the chrome in Pandemic detracts from people's experience. It makes it overly fiddly or complicated. 

Others may not enjoy the puzzle of beating the game if it takes 45-60 minutes. But they may enjoy the puzzle in 20-30 minutes.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4

A fast,  light and fun co-op,  Forbidden Island boasts  some fine components,  a bit of atmosphere and a wide range of accessibility,  all in a well designed package.

There is a fair amount of challenge presented here,  which varies depending on the initial set up and the chosen difficulty level.  I think it plays best as a two player puzzle or solo using that same player count - there is just not enough to do to justify the downtime in multi player mode.

With it's variable tile set up and several difficulty levels,  you would tend to think that the game will feel a bit different in each and every play,  but in actuality,  it doesn't.  Played sparingly,  or with children,  this can be quite an enjoyable experience.

Just realize you are in no danger of drowning in the deep here - this island is surrounded by shallow water.

RATING: 6
Bought this game because it was cheap, it plays in 30 minutes, and it is a game by Matt Leacock. I'd never even listened the game's name.

After getting home, and reading the rules, I realized I bought a cheaper, faster, simpler Pandemic.

I know this is a simplistic analysis, but it really feels like this. And it is not bad. I love Pandemic, and now I can get a similar feel with another game.

A note: being easier to learn does not make this game easier to win. And unlike Pandemic, here you have the need to hurry since your first turn. There's no time to "have everything under control". You have to get the treasures and leave the island. 

Matt Leacock knows "his shit".

I bought this because of the cooperative element and because it's accessible to children. So far it has lived up to the hype. My daughter places this among her very favorites and it's one of the games that is least likely to cause her to get upset from not doing well. The game is engaging for everyone, though I don't anticipate playing this outside of a family setting.

This is a great family co-op that's good fun. The concepts are easy enough for kids (probably aged 8-10) to learn and have fun with. The game is challenging but (like many co-ops) can be adjusted depending on the group.

Fun game to play with kids (6+) Being a co-op, this is a good game to teach little ones how to think strategically as you can lead them to decisions and explain why moves are a good idea - although you will find they quickly grasp the important needs. 

Also, you win or lose as a group, so whether they win or lose, younger kids will enjoy the process and feel like they were a part of the team.

Played this for the first time a few days ago and it was incredibly fun.  Although a bit hard.  It was difficult for four players to get all of the treasures and get out in time although we have not developed a lot of strategies quite yet.  Out of four games we played we only won once.  And our first game we got incredibly close.  

All in all a pretty good game that is fairly inexpensive.

FB is a nice introduction to the concept of Co-Op games, as it's not overly complicated but uses a lot of mechanics that you'll see in other games like it. Plus, it's fairly quick to play, so ideal to even rope in a notoriously quick-to-get-bored 7-year old.
I feel that after a lot of play-throughs it gets a bit stale, as nothing really new ever happens anymore, and as you feel you can see whether you can win or lose early on. But still a very solid game.

A good and simple (this is also good sometimes) co-op game. It's basically like Pandemic in the main mechanics - the cards that comeback once a trigger is activated, the collection of cards in order to find a treasure/heal a disease, the roles with very clear functions.

However Forbidden Island has one major advantage: the board is modular, so it changes every game. Even the set-up can change (the one I like the most is the Skull Island).

It is fast enough to be a great filler. For it's price, it is a must have.

This is maybe a bit unfair rating for the game because it comes from a gamers perspective. This game is just too simple.

I have played this maybe seven times and I just have no longer reason to play it again.

This is one gorgeous looking game: It is unbelievable how Gamewright managed to offer linnen-textured cards, plastic miniatures, thick tiles, amazing artwork and a tin box for such a low price. And the atmosphere induced by the well-chosen theme is fantastic. Gameplay-wise the game is pleasant enough, with simple rules, a short playing time and sufficient replayability due to the various difficulty settings and random map. Still, I clearly prefer Matt's original masterpiece Pandemic as it offers more tension and is generally more demanding.
UPDATE: Much better with three instead of two players (Elite level)! Nice tension.
UPDATE: The more I play it, the more I feel that success depends largely on the order in which the cards come up. Despite the theme, Pandemic is definitely the better game.

Pandemic-lite. I know so many people say it, but the rules are so similar! Still, for $19 in a metal tin with super high quality components, Forbidden Island stands above every other tabletop offer as the best value in gaming. Period. And for that reason, you all should own a copy. It's fun and it will get your friends that don't play board games interested in euros.

Forbidden Island is a good game, with high component quality, but it's not my favorite. It's a little too simplistic for my tastes, and while you can increase the difficulty by starting at a higher water level you can't increase the complexity. I prefer the similar, but more complex, Pandemic over this game, except when playing with children.

Took a few plays to get past the comparison to Pandemic which we absolutely love.  Now it is our number one gateway game that plays fast and we can still enjoy it with noobs.  Has plenty to talk about.  Fortunately there is something about this co-op that gets noobs contributing sound ideas and we don't find the experienced players completly dominating.

Cooperative games are a toss up for me and a 'simplified' one is pushing the limit. I do enjoy it with family and non-gamers but if you have certain roles out then you better chock up the difficulty rating or you will be coasting through it (I'm looking at the trader and pilot. Pity the fool who is the diver when the other two are out!).

I feel like once you've figured out the roles, it's very easy to predict quite early on whether you are going to lose. If the wrong tiles come up, there is sometimes nothing you can do about it.

I also dislike that once you know the game, you can either dominate or sit back and watch people self-destruct. Neither is a very fun time.

The components are quite nice, however, and this is good for teaching and for younger players.

It's just different enough from Pandemic to be exciting-- it's a lot more random, but at the same time, you can control the randomness just enough to make it more fun than, say, Monopoly Deal. I think exciting is the best word-- if I want a more controlled game with options, I'll go for Pandemic, but if I'm in a less thinky mood, I think FI scratches that itch slightly more.

This is absolutely "Pandemic light" in mechanics and in the strategies you'll use (and easier to win, too- Fool's Landing sinking is definitely the most dangerous loss condition).  I would say if you own one, you probably don't need the other.  The production value is AMAZING for the price.

Very good game.  Much lighter than Pandemic, but things still have a way of snowballing.  In fact, we lost our first game on the first turn.  Bad luck there.  Great looking components.  From the tin box to the miniatures and artwork on the tiles and cards this is a high quality production and a steal at less the $20.00.

Well-made, visually attractive, inexpensive, fun cooperative game, a must-have for kids, especially because it's one of very few easy, cooperative board games.

Now, I wouldn't say that Forbidden Desert replaced Forbidden Island, but Desert is definitely better. 

What FI does really well is make the theme really come out really well. You really feel like you are on a sinking island and are panicking to find what you need and get off. It's a cooperative game and really has some tough decisions. The game also plays pretty quickly which is nice.

My only complaint about the Forbidden series is that I wish they made a larger version that could accommodate more players. Other than that issue, our group loves this game and it works well when we have several games running with smaller groups in rotation.

The Forbidden series are very easy to learn, can be fast-paced or casual depending on the group, and are a LOT of fun!

RATING: 5
Play was really fun the first time (3 player) and even fun the second time.  By the third play (4 player) it started feeling boring and like the same game.  It's definitely a nice, light gateway game and a fun cooperative.  However, it's also easy for one dominant player to control everyone and tell them what to do.

The special abilities are nice, there is definitely an element of tension with the rising waters, and setup is easy.  We might enjoy it more if we start out with the flood meter on a higher difficulty and purposely choose characters with less useful abilities, but we have too many games we enjoy more to bring this out often.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
I'll say up front that my rating is getting boosted by the sheer price to quality ratio.  I still can't believe that I picked this game up on Amazon for a little over 12 bucks.  Really top notch quality, plastic treasures, great feel to the cards, thick tiles, and a tin box.  Crazy.

Gameplay-wise, I'd probably give the game a strong "6".  It's my first collaborative game, thought it would be a good intro to the genre, and it didn't disappoint.  The game is extremely easy to grasp after one read-through the 2 page instructions, takes a few minutes to fill in your teammates, and then you're off.  The people I played with on their first play were already chiming in on strategies a round or so in.

The reason I wouldn't rate this higher is the flip side of that coin, this game is pretty simple.  There isn't much variety from game to game, you get different roles, and the placement of tiles switches up, but each play through feels very familiar.   There are no real curve-balls getting thrown at you, either the luck of the cards work in your favor, or they don't.

Enjoyable little game though, I'm for sure going to keep it around for a fast little filler, or as a gateway game, and I'd be happy to play it here and there.

Beautiful, but vapid.  There are very few meaningful decisions here, and the game basically dictates whether you're going to win or lose -- your actions have much less impact than whether the right people get the right cards at the right time.  What you have is a complicated version of a mass-market game: there's few decisions, the game is very procedural, but the mechanics are difficult enough that it's not really for the tykes.  [gameid=30549] didn't really need a simpler version.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION AS NON-GAMER GAME

UPDATE: A bit too easy, but good for non-gamers/family groups.

Strictly better than Pandemic. More attractive bits, less clunky mechanics, simpler to learn, but with similar tactical depth.

Doesn't get played as much as other games I own, but I'm not sure why. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Underrated, this race-the-clock fantasy co-op may be the perfect gateway to cooperative gaming.  Not as mechanically complex as Forbidden Desert (its more challenging younger brother), this theme is more colorful and aesthetically pleasing.  In addition, Island plays more quickly, is easier to teach, and can actually prove more challenging than Pandemic, now a classic co-op intro. 

While Forbidden Desert is a monotone yellow, Forbidden Island is a vibrant, art-filled, fantasy adventure.  Though simpler in game mechanics (and perhaps too simple for experienced co-op'ers), the race to beat sinking islands while hunting treasure proves more exciting than Desert's race to remove sand.  Island, despite its more simple rules, can also prove more challenging than Pandemic, depending on the difficulty level setting; Island also plays more quickly and is easier to teach, making it a potential co-op filler (set-up is quicker than either Desert or Pandemic).  If you can't convince someone to play Eldritch Horror, Dead of Winter or the epic Pandemic Legacy (or want to ease them in...ahem), Forbidden Island is a fast-paced and mechanically simple, yet still strategic and exciting, toe-dip into the waters of co-op gaming.

I recommend this to all co-op gamers, even if only as a lure for their friends and family not yet willing to attempt the more challenging and sizeable co-op adventures currently topping the BGG ranks.

1e essai à 4 joueurs. Du même auteur et sorti quelques années après Pandémie, il réutilise la mécanique de son prédécesseur (les cartes "danger" étant recyclées au-dessus de la pioche) mais il est plus accessible et se joue plus rapidement. En cela, il a le mérite d’offrir une bonne initiation aux jeux de type coopératifs et c’est la seule situation pour laquelle je le recommanderais.

RATING: 6
Pandemic Lite pretty much sums up the game.  The role cards and the actions are so similar to its pappy that the game's differences only come in via the end-game conditions, and the way the bad events are even more random.  I suppose there's a possibility that folks might get it for their kids to play, but Pandemic is pretty kid-friendly in its own right.  I further suppose that this is intended to be the stopgap between the people who would be interested in cooperative games and the more hobby-ish games that fall into that category, but I'm not sure I see why anyone who already likes Pandemic would choose this game over it, save for variety.

RATING: 5
This feels like a streamlined, stripped-down version of Pandemic to me. Normally, I would think of that as a good thing, as my favorite games tend to be ones with the most straightforward rule sets. However, in this case, I think the result feels more like Pandemic Junior than Pandemic Light. It wasn't just that we won when I played this with Pandemic vets; we won by a mile. There was never any tension, and about a quarter of the turns we just kind of sat there using one or two actions. It's possible that we just had a really optimal setup and card draws, but given that one of the three players started with one of each type of treasure card and both of the flame tiles had flood cards revealed early, I doubt that. I think the problem is that you don't really care about at least half of the island, so the sense of urgency you get in Pandemic with the outbreaks isn't really there.

Even so, the system isn't terrible, and if I was looking for a co-op game to play with kids, this would be high on my list.

Not an original game, since inspired by [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic]Pandemic[/url] also from the same author...

But the best coop game to introduce new people to either board gaming or coop games... Very light and unfortunately very easy to win... even at Legendary for veteran gamers.

A light game to be taken... lightly with no further expectations

Reductionist Pandemic but easier to teach, shorter to complete.
Medium weight, medium-high crunch.
Medium player interaction, mostly verbal.
Medium theme application.

The original reductionist Pandemic by the same designer, Matt Leacock. I really like it as it's a shorter, slightly easier to track iteration of the same dynamic with the tactile fun of flipping and removing tiles and handling artifacts.

Co-op games are intended to be difficult to make victories rare and rewarding, and players need to find the fun in losing (see: Space Alert!). I love chaos, crunch and pressure and while Island probably isn't as chaotic as other games (even Pandemic has the outbreaks that ripple across the board), it can still be punishing. Definitely a good one to introduce folks to co-op gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A quick playing co-op with a variable map and multiple player roles.  Simple rules, but challenging to play.  Like many co-ops, there is a great deal of tension trying to collectively surmount the challenge(s).  I have enjoyed my initial plays, but I wonder about how long it can sustain player interest due to it's streamlined design.  Nevertheless, a nice design that offers a good challenge.

[i]Forbidden Island[/i] is a fun, charming game appropriate for the family magazine editors that turn up their collective noses at [i]Pandemic[/i] whenever I try to suggest that game as an innovative mainstream design that’s also family friendly. [i]Forbidden Island[/i] strips away all the dying and plague – although players are still grave-robbers, mind you – replacing that negativity with colorful components, easy-to-shuffle cards, and chunky tiles, all packaged in an inviting way for game-players everywhere.

So I guess I'm a heretic--I consider myself a "gamer" and I like Forbidden Island better than Pandemic.  Here are the reasons:

1. None of that convoluted deck preparation business.  If I didn't have to do it every single time for our Pandemic games, this might be less of an issue.  But I do.  I didn't realize how much of my undesire to play Pandemic was wound up in preparing the stupid deck until I played Forbidden Island.  Maybe I'm just a weenie.

2. Variable board.  I really like this.  The game is different every time.  The connections between "nodes" (tiles) are more uniform than Pandemic's (cities), which implies that they would be less interesting, but I don't find them so.

3. Simpler card exchanging rules.  Exchanging cards in Pandemic without a special power is a pain.  Yes, this adds to the strategy, since you really have to plan well.  But I just find it annoying and unthematic that I can't always give a card to someone when I'm in the same city as them.

4. No hidden cards rules.  You just put 'em face up.  Simple and easy.  Got someone who takes control of every game because they can see every card?  Don't play with them.

5. More appealing ending condition.  Get the treasure and get off the island.  Easy peasy.  In Pandemic, every new player wants to know why we don't have to cure all the diseases.  "Well, because now it's really easy to do so because we've got all the cures!" I say.  Well, why don't we [i]do it[/i] then?!

The theme is more unique in Pandemic, and the outbreak mechanic is cooler than flooding and sinking.  But everything is just simpler, faster, and more straightforward about Forbidden Island.  I groan (inside) when someone wants to play Pandemic, but right now I'll happily play Forbidden Island any time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Forbidden island is a great game.  granted it is pretty easy, and doesn't create a drastic challenge like it's big brother Pandemic, but I feel like it is a game that more non-gamers would be drawn to because of the theme, and complexity.  Also, being a teacher, Forbidden island is a lot easier to pull out with my younger students.  The biggest draw back is I feel it is a lot easier to suffer from an alpha gamer in this game rather than other co-op games.

Juego con mecánica parecida al Pandemic aunque simplificada, ya que el tipo de acciones que se pueden realizar se reducen a la mitad. No hay tablero sino que se diseña mediante cartas losetas, así que cada partida es diferente según la posición de algunas losetas. He leido que al final de la partida hay bastante tensión. En resumidas cuentas, un buen y sencillo juego cooperativo, que ronda los 20eu y será publicado por Devir en formato lata.

Forbidden Island is a simple, accessible co-op game that I feel would be ideal for families, especially those with younger children. Despite its simple rules, the game can be quite challenging and that does give it some decent replay value. While it isn't terribly deep and the strategy is usually pretty obvious, it is a good game for attracting non-gamers and it's length of play is just about right at 30 minutes or so.

"A simplified Pandemic" is what comes to mind immediately. The problem here is that i never felt very involved as I am in Pandemic. The game flows nicely, it seems very balanced (even if i heard of plays ended at first turn...), components are very nice. It just doesn't pluck any of the strings of my heart. Probably it is good as a filler for newbies.

Very simple cooperative game.  Tiles will flip once when becoming 'flooded' after which you have to 'shore them up' by flipping them back, if you don't then those tiles will start to 'sink' (be removed from the game).  It creates a thematic sense of urgency as the island sinks around you.

'18/01/05: Have been enjoying this as a solo game, trying different player counts and roles.

Met het etiket Pandemie - light kan ik het alleen maar eens zijn. Het is een lekker luchtige co-op.

De spelers zijn allen avonturiers op een eiland met verborgen schatten erop. Het probleem is alleen dat het eiland in de oceaan wegzickt zodra ze voet aan land zetten. De spelers moeten samenwerken om de schatten te verzamelen en weg te komen voordat de oceaan ze opslokt. Iedere speler heeft een speciale eigenschap die kan helpen.

It's very simple and easy to play, while having varying difficulty. I've been able to convince non-boardgaming people to play this the easiest.

I've almost played this with everyone. It's just so fun. The best times were when I played with Jenn and her housemates my fourth year at UCSC. Wine nights were the best times I've had with you Jenn.

I am giddy over this game right now, but that might be due to the fact that we just won. Which actually concerns me a bit as I am not sure there will be a ton of variation.  I will update after I have a few dozen games under my belt.

I love that it is a quick, easy to learn, cooperative game.  The tiles are beautiful, and the play is innovative.

RATING: 6
For those unsure whether they should spend the green, there's no need to own this if you're an adult who only plays games with adults.  Pandemic is the preferred game, always, under those circumstances.  If you're a gamer with young kids or plastic-hungry pets - as many of us are - then Forbidden Island is a fluffy alternative where tile flipping (shoring up) seems to be a favorite pastime.

The 10-up age suggestion is a bit overboard. An older child would have a good chance of winning with a 7-year-old, a 2-year-old, and a pet rock - because everyone plays with their hand cards revealed.  So if someone wants to call all the plays, they can.

That's to be avoided, of course.  Collaborative conversation is where it's at.

Also, with a few plays under their belt, there's a good chance that a group of kids would be able to play this one entirely unsupervised - something that would never happen with Pandemic due to its awkward set-up.  I'm all about providing the younger set with quality coop alternatives, and Forbidden Island fills that niche in spades.

Very nice, fast and clean cooperative game. Great for family play. I slightly prefer this over "Pandemic," the earlier game that it is based on. I like the shrinking island feeling here and the claustrophobia that it brings on, and the simplifications to the rules make it play faster without losing the tension and strategy.

Played at UK Games Expo 2010. We didn't get what all the fuss was about. This is like a very easy, lighter version of Pandemic. It works as a game, but presents little of a challenge and I see no reason to play this over Pandemic. Its only advantage is the variable board.

Our family's first coop game. Simple mechanics with a pretty decent challenge. I enjoy playing this with our kids (currently 6 & 8) and occasionally play by myself on the ipad.

Matt Leacock's simplest co-op game so far.

It has the same mechanics from Pandemic but in a smaller scale. Victory Conditions are also simpler, which makes this game a great way to introduce non-board gamers to the co-op gender.

However, it does not replace Pandemic as a co-op game. If you have to choose between one or another, go with Pandemic. 

Still so, I consider this the best gateway game I have.

Does what it sets out to do almost perfectly. Fairly light but very easy to play and quite challenging to win coop. Everybody I play with seems to like it.

Our first cooperative game and one with a very cool theme and artwork. This game does a good job of creating a mechanic where it's not readily apparent that you are playing against yourself.

The treasure tokens and storage tin are a great touch.

Decent filler or intro game, almost a pre-gateway game. A few decisions to be made, and now several variant tile setups. The high production for a low price makes it worth owning if it will actually get played but it's highly redundant if you own Pandemic and don't have kids.

Good also for an introduction to Co-op. Got it originally to play with my daughter who is 8 and she really likes it. It's more of a kids/intro game then anything and holds up well when viewed as such. The tiles, cards, box are all really well made especially for the cost (I got it for 11.99 new).

This is a difficult game to beat!

I played this game multiple times the first session and nearly won once, but had fun losing all the same.

The game play is one of those which makes you hope you do not get an ulcer from the constant stress it elicits.  It gets pretty intense and definitely keeps you on your toes!

The components are superb!  The inclusion of actual treasure figures takes the game over the top and makes for a more visually appealing experience.  

The game tiles have beautiful depictions of island locations which contribute nicely to the overall theme of the game.

After 1 Play: I don't really care for co-ops, and this did nothing to change my mind.  If I had to play a co-op, I can't see ever picking this over Pandemic.

Great cooperation game. Plays very well with kids. My six-year old picked it up quickly and can even play it himself after just a few games. Fast game which is excellent for kids as well. Teaches the value of prioritizing. Typical euro to the extent that the mechanics are far more important than theme, but it is still colorful enough.Nice components AND tin box.

Forbidden Desert is a better game for me, so sold this one.

This game is the original cooperative game. That being said - it's really hard! Seriously. Play the iPad version - it's not easy to win.

After a few games this has been a real surprise. I bought it for my son for Christmas as he's not that into confrontational games and thought a co-op would work well. I couldn't of been any more right. It worked a treat. Such a simple game but so difficult to win and a fantastic sense of tension and a relentless fight against the inevitable sinking of the island. 

Fantastic family game for all ages.

Its cool. Good value. Great gateway co op.  The wife likes it.

May be a bit simple for die hard gamers but its still fun and the bits are stellar.

VERY similar to Pandemic. If you love Pandemic you will definitely like this simpler, faster, and more accessible version.

A lighter version of Pandemic, with gorgeous luscious artwork, and great quality components.

One minor gripe is the omission of a standee for the Water Level Marker, but I [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/997946/forbidden-island]made my own[/url] to combat this.

The best diminishing area game I've ever played bar none.

I was always putting this game on the back burner for the longest time. Fast forward 5 months and I now have this on my "must play" list. A really great game for introducing non-gamers into the hobby.

Pandemic light (not that this is a bad thing). Forbidden Island might be the perfect family intro-game to co-ops. Setup is fast, rules explanation is fast, turns are fast = fast and tense game.

Fun coop game. Doesn't break any new ground but all the components are great quality and it can get tense. Always a good grab for a game night.

We had a lot of fun with this game for awhile, but it lacked the depth to keep us playing over the long term.  Quality components and a nice metal collectors box.  Card quality wasn't the best.

If you are looking for a great stand-alone co-op game I would highly recommend Pandemic, but if you're looking for co-op game to play with younger kids or just a filler game that has more depth than most filler games and captures the essence of larger co-ops Forbidden Island is the way to go.

This is a solid, though quite simple, game. But, it is a co'op, which is definitely not my cup of tea. Also, the difficulty varies immensely depending on the card mix.

The game components are beautiful and the design is lovely. I find myself enjoying the game even alone, when I have 20 minutes or so to kill. It is a great filler and family game.

RATING: 6.8
Simple co-op game with a good luck/skill ratio. 
Quite light and therefore suitable for family game-nights with kids. 
Provides lots of excitement as the explorers scamper about on drowning tiles. 
Great box. Attractive, good quality components.

Ein kooperatives Spiel, das an eine einsteigerfreundliche Version von Pandemie erinnert, aber mindestens genau so viel Spaß macht. Auch schon zu zweit!

Cooperativo en el que hay que desplazarse por la isla para encontrar los 4 tesoros sagrados (que se reclaman con cartas). Debes evitar que la isla se hunda antes de que escapes.

If this came before Pandemic it would be fine. But it didn't.  It's waaaay too lite and easy, and I struggle to think of a good reason to play this over Desert or Pandemic unless you're playing with young kids.
It's ok, just forgettable

Fun, challenging, and I can play it with my parents. What more can you ask for...

Another which my girlfriend took a dislike to. I thought she'd like it, being similar to her favourite - Dominion, but it's just too nerdy. I find the theme rich, the mechanics a little over-complex, and the play-time too long. I've enjoyed the solo-game, and it's fun with a group if you have the time, but feels like it should be a co-op. There's not much interaction. Indeed the rules include a co-op variant, which I may try.

Traded due to lack of opportunities to play, sadly.  (Dominion is a very similar game, and runs much quicker.) I got "At the Gates of Loyang" in return, which has become one of my firm favourites.

A dominion clone I wasn't going to buy.  This set contains all that the game has become.  More thematic than dominion. Sometimes a little mathy but a game with great potential and momentum.  Plays great solo.

Dominion's fantasy themed brother. 

PROs
- Excellent theme
- Greater variety of game mechanics as compared to Dominion
- Great mix of cards with ideas from previous expansions
- Requires more precision in building your deck than Dominion
- Great art and production value (esp relative to its cost)

CONs
- Relatively luck dependent
- Bad luck or poor card mix can result in long and draggy games
- Much more fiddly than Dominion (as a result of all the layers of mechanics)

While I personally prefer Dominion, there is a really good game in this box and anyone whois undecided should give it a chance.

Dominion with a dungeon crawler twist. Same game as the Thunderstone base game but with better components. Not sure about the new art, I think I like the art style from the base game better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An improvement over base Thunderstone because of the components.  However, the gameplay still feels really clunky to me.  Killing monsters is largely dependent on what you can get in your hand, and it feels like luck plays a larger role than in something like Dominion.  I still see potential in the system, and I really need to play more to form a concrete opinion.

[i]Posted: 11/30/11, Rated: 8[/i]

As a first time BGG.con attendee, I'll let those of you who have not yet attended in on a little secret:

[i]Don't wait to start playing on Sunday.[/i]

Rolling in from Saturday night gaming at 4:00 AM meant an 11:00 AM start later that morning.  Left to grab "breakfast" with friends, and it was already 12:30 by the time I was ready to sit down and play.

Uh-oh.  The library was closing up.  The Funagain store was closed.  And since I don't check bags when I fly, I had already shipped my purchases and prizes home the day before.  That left my friend Greg and me desperately looking for games to play.  We decided to try a demo of [i]Thunderstone: Dragonspire[/i] at the [company=396]AEG[/company] tables.

Had I played [i][thing=53953][/thing][/i] before?  Nope.  I had played [thing=36218]that "other" game[/thing].  Was fond of it, even though it was a shuffle-fest.  About the only thing I knew about [i][thing=53953][/thing][/i] was that it was a deck-building clone, capitalizing upon the success of the original (and therefore, better) game.

Drop your torches and pitchforks, [i][thing=53953][/thing][/i] fans.  By the end of the game I was a convert.  I guess that means that fans of [i][thing=36218][/thing][/i] can pick those items up off of the ground.

I liked the fact that money and "estate" cards weren't one-dimensional: if I couldn't mount a successful quest during my turn, then those same equipment and hero cards doubled up as currency to improve my raiding party.  Earning experience points to level up my heroes was exciting.  It turns out that [i]Dragonspire[/i] includes a board to track monsters and Darkness, along with experience counters: plastic versions of the iconic Thunderstone.

These differences provided my quests through [i]Dragonspire[/i] with more flavor than a standard game of [i][thing=36218][/thing][/i].  I could feel myself becoming more invested in my heroes, wanting them to succeed.  In comparison, [i][thing=36218][/thing][/i] feels dry and mechanical.

Don't get me wrong: [i][thing=36218][/thing][/i] still has a place in my heart, and on my shelves.  I will still return to it as being the title which won both the [i]Spiel des Jahres[/i] and the [i]Deutscher Spiele Preis[/i] -- [geekurl=/tag/sdj-winner+dsp-winner/user/Beowulf]a feat only six games have accomplished[/geekurl] -- in 2009.  But before BGG.con, I would have said that there was no reason to own both games.  Now, I can't wait to receive my copy of [url=http://www.coolstuffinc.com/p/Board%20Games/Thunderstone%3A+Complete+Set+Bundle/Acc-AEGThunderstoneBundle/#Thunderstone%3A+Complete+Set+Bundle]the entire set[/url].

Only 1 set of Basic cards/xp tokens, shared between the Base Set and Dragonspire.

Base Set is in the Doomgate Legion box. Wrath of Elements is in the Dragonspire box. The other boxes are not available, though contents can be shuffled if someone is not interested in the whole collection.

RATING: 6
The Fire-Elementals are cool since they give you light, but they seem unbalanced because they have low health and fairly high VP and XP compared to other monsters that don't give attack/light bonuses.  As an example, a mid-range fire guy (7 health) had the same 5 VP as a guardian with 12 health.

Equally as good as the base Thunderstone game.  Not as great as an expansion because it does not add much new to the game, but still well worth having if you are a Thunderstone fan.  

The board is a disappointment.  It's too big for what it provides, and yet with all of that available space they made the attack/light modifier text small and hard to read (blue text).  The plastic experience point tokens are nice!

It's hard to give an assessment based off the one setup I've played but here goes: It certainly plays in a very Dominion like fashion so knowing Dominion can help you get into the game. I like the different feel of the Thunderstone and think it's probably different enough from Dominion to justify its place alongside Dominion in a games collection. My biggest gripe with the one game I had was the playing time (at least an hour and a half). If that's normal then it's a big negative point for me. Based on 1 play.

Some nice ideas and like the theme more than Dominion. Need to be careful at times to make sure the random card selection doesn't make it impossible to win.

My only major gripe with this is that it's the first game I've actually needed to sleeve since the wear and tear was starting to do a number on the cards - though it should be noted I'm still amazed I've not had to do this for Dominion (yet).

The box and the card dividers are perfect; so much better than the box and dividers in the base game. The XP chips are great, as is the dungeon board.

It's cool to have some variety in the hero leveling, making some heroes deeper and some wider.

The settings are strange. We've played with two so far. A setting to rotate monsters in the dungeon is strange, and makes it difficult to plan ahead. The setting for monsters not generating gold really slows the game down and clogs up my hand. Yuck. We don't play with these anymore.

The dungeon board and XP chits while not absolutely necessary are still nice to have. They could have included more chits just to make sure you won't run out of them (which we did in a 5p game).

If you are new to Thunderstone, skip the original set and just get this.  This is better tuned and fuller featured!

For a pure deck-building experience I would still choose Dominion.  For a thematic card game adventure, I think I prefer Sentinels of the Multiverse.  Even with all the fiddliness for SotM, it is somewhat less annoying that the Thunderstone math.  So while I have had some fun with TS, these two games have knocked TS off my shelf.  It is actually a fairly shallow deckbuilding experience, and too beholden to the Dominion framework to execute very well on the theme.

I was thinking between 8 and 9 for this game. I couldn't choose, so I gave it 8.5.

For a card game, both dominion and 7 wonders are better. They have better mechanics, and are better balanced out.

However this game has a unique "fluff" to it - instead of building wonders and random stuff, you are exploring the dungeon here. I guess this will be intriguing to all D&D players. 

Game is ok, and I would play it anytime, alto there are 2 things that I really don't like: negative monsters which might make king-maker (of 5 games it happened once), and too long time for set-up and downtime between player turns in max players.

There is also a mode for solo play, which some might find interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good game, but I would probably always want to play Dominion instead. (The games are very similiar, but different.)

I feel that there are a lot of cards that are uninteresting, and just a few that you want.
So that gives each game a lot of "bling" that is needed.

You could say that about a lot of Dominion games as well, but it's even more obvious in Thunderstone in my opinion.

It has a lot better integration of a theme than Dominion.
You really feel that you go to the village to mass up a band of heroes, and then from time to time search out the dreaded cave and slay monsters.

Adds experience tokens, Settings and new art for basic cards.

The little experience point tokens are a huge upgrade, the cards were really lame and you do get plenty of them.
New art work is nice but wasn't really needed. Generally just shuffle the two art works together.

Settings are underwhelming as well as they change the conditions of play but generally in quite an irrelevant way.

More thunderstones are nice but the abilities are a bit irrelevant as the game ends when the thunderstone is claimed, however there is a variant where several thunderstones are added to the deck. Have not played this.

Traded in a math trade (2012) for Claustrophobia: De Profundis.

Trading Dragonspire with Doomgate Legion in the box. Also has the Promo Pack in the box. Have played 22 times without sleeves so there is some wear on the cards. One militia is a little worse for wear, otherwise the cards can't be distinguished from each other from the back.

Plays 1-13 with just Thundersone: Dragonspire. Plays 14-current with Thunderstone: Doomgate Legion mixed in.

Attended BGGCON 2011, my first, and played this in the AEG booth...loved it so I bought it and the latest expansion pack - Heart of Doom.

Takes awhile to build up your deck to go into the dungeon & fight the monsters.  

Loved the way AEG streamlines the box to add all the expansion packs into one box...but only three expansion packs can fit into the box!  Still it’s nice to condense into one to make more room in the game closet!

Way too fantastic super great Caity and Brian birthday gift 2012!

Yeah! Thunderstone works well. I was happy that we were able to get into it so easily. This game flows nicely and turns come quickly. Dominion may be the purer game, but Thunderstone is a marvelous beast and worthy of the deck-building genre of games, which has since become saturated.  The designers have called this "deck-building with a purpose" and I agree. It is so much easier to get into the theme of Thunderstone than Dominion. The monster fighting, leveling up, and variety of heroes, monsters, weapons and spells makes this one of my favoutites. Overall, if there could only be two deckbuilders in this world, I'd pick Dominion and Thunderstone. And if there could be only one? I might have to chose this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I feel like I'm drinking the wrong cool aid with this one. Why do people like it so much?

I've often encountered situations where the dungeon was completely clogged with high-level monsters or magic-only monsters early in the game which confines gameplay to tedious trips to the village to eventually build a deck. How is this fun?

Enter Richard Launius and Tom Vasel with a variant that's better than the base game. There's a sign of solid design, right? Still, Epic Thunderstone is just more playable. A good game but not a great game.

I feel like this game gets away with most of its crap design because the fantasy theme gives it an unwarranted pass.

It's like the Diablo 3 of deckbuilders, or Quarriors:  Sure, the formula kind of works, but aren't there more interesting ways to pass the time in a fantasy setting?

Ooooh plastic tokens and a dungeon board for Thunderstone! I suppose that was an attempt at balancing the lower quality artwork on the cards and a new, somewhat different linen texture.

The gameplay is basically the same though...and it looks like AEG may be releasing so many expansions that we will have to buy a special AEG Truck card storage option somewhere down the line.

Definitely my preferred deck building game.  My introduction to the deck building games was Ascension.  The next game I tried was Dominion.  This game feels like both games in one.  I did not like the lack of theme in Dominion.  Thunderstone definitely has theme. After playing my first couple of games, I knew this was much more enjoyable than both Ascension and Dominion.

Yet More Stuff. The balance is, as per usual, occasionally suspect (Toryn Gauntlet, I'm looking at you, you ridiculously awesome card), but I care less and less with each passing expansion.
Dragonspire gets the nod over the other expansions for the new basic cards (daggers that don't look like artifacts), XP tokens, and the obscenely good box and divider system. AEG's stellar support doesn't hurt, either. I now feel 100% completely assured in my preference for Thunderstone above all other deck-builders.

[i]You show up at the bad guys' hideout with a squad of shivering militiamen, enough daggers for one to stab while two watch, some torches and a donkey laden with picnic baskets.  Next stop:  LEGEND.[/i]

This is my first foray into the "deck building" genre; I'm simultaneously glad I waited and slapping myself for not jumping in earlier.  

[boardgame=36218]Dominion[/boardgame]'s theme makes my head glaze over with the whole "impress the king with the most victory points" thing—I'm much more drawn to the "longest trail of dead" theme.  I ignored [boardgame=53953]Thunderstone[/boardgame] for the longest time due to my misunderstanding that it was merely a re-themed clone... and just about the time I realized the truth there was talk of [i]Dragonspire[/i] coming out as a stand-alone starter set.

And so I waited.  Almost two years.

Two years I could've—[i]should've[/i]—been playing [i]Thunderstone[/i] and expansions.

On the theme-side it's laid on pretty thick, with all the usual fantasy tropes and more than a few nods to [rpg=191]Dungeons & Dragons[/rpg] and the [i]Heavy Metal[/i] movie, which I appreciate and find charming.

As for how it plays, it's quick and painless.  Not having played—or even seen—any deck building game I had little idea of how it worked, even after reading the rules.  Our first game snapped the ambiguities into crystal focus after only a couple of turns.  It's really very simple.  You choose one of three actions on your turn:

• Discard one of your cards from the game,

• Buy a card from the village, or

• Kill a monster in the dungeon.

In no time at all it's obvious which of these your hand is best suited for.  The turns whip around the table, often getting back to you before you've reshuffled your deck.  The speed of play is a cool, and unexpected, aspect.

About the shuffling: I enjoy it a great deal—the feel, the sound, the [i]monkey-having-something-to-do[/i] bit.  If you don't like shuffling, this is going to kill you.

The end result is a pleasant diversion—it's pretty, the theme is comfortably familiar with enough new stuff to keep it interesting, and the play is quick and satisfying.  This will probably end up as a 10 given that each tableau is unique and the fine expansions only serve to crank the variation toward the exponential.

[microbadge=19703]

RATING: 8
I like it as a 2-3 player game, as you can to some degree plan ahead.  With 4 players, there is too much downtime and sometimes all the monsters on the board may change before you take your next turn.  Therefore the impression of randomness increases.  There is quite a bit of counting involved but your decisions count - even if you only have three choices each turn (rest, visit a village, enter the dungeon) - you need to plan your moves.  By resting you destroy one card from your hand - I only take this action if nothing else works. By visiting a village, you can buy a hero/weapon etc. - you need to observe the stacks and sometimes buy out the good stuff before your opponent has a chance to purchase them.  You select your purchases based on the monsters in the dungeon, your cards in the deck (weapons have weight and may be used by heroes with adequate strength, you need to consider monsters in the dungeons, etc.) and sometimes the cards that your opponents have in their decks...

This is a great set, I've even recommended this as the starter set for one person looking to buy into Thunderstone for the first time. There are a number of great cards and truly awesome combos in this set.  I love most of the new artwork and it provides a decent mix for the base cards. I've enjoyed playing this solo but it's very easy to get locked into a specific strategy with some cards and ignore the majority of villager cards. The game really shines with three players IMO as you need a strategy but also may need to "fight" to get specific cards and keep a flexible strategy at the same time.

Including the Dragon-Humanoid index card for a future promo...cool but cruel!  The setting cards are a great addition to further mix things up and break up any future monotony (as if!).

My only minor complaint is that there is no index card for my Harruli. This box is completely full with all the prior sets and promos and weighs about as much as a cinder block.  So what are we going to do when the next expansion comes out?  I need to carry TWO boxes?!? LOL

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Awesome. Has some of the really fun aspects of other deck-building greats like Dominion, but a much tighter integration with the theme. The flow of action as you build a party, visit the village to recruit or buy items, and then enter the dungeon to fight, collecting treasure and experience points which let you level up brings me right back to my roleplaying days in tight intense bursts. The mechanics are complicated at first, but I think they make the game more robust and completely addictive.

This one does add some nice item, monsters and heroes.  But compared to the originals selection it seems to bog down and get a bit too fiddly with all the various aspects they bring to the game.  If your looking to start somewhere start with the original Thunderstone which runs alot simpler and smoother and get this as an expansion.

Wasn't a big fan of the new art work at first but some have grown on me, but some just remain shockingly out of character.

Thunderstone as a game system has two main advantages vs. Dominion:
1. It doesn't feature combos where you browse through 20+ cards each turn.
2. Deck-thinning isn't as annoying as Dominion where you end up with ultra-thin decks that repeat themselves each turn.
My main gripes with deckbuilding are avoided making Thunderstone my favourite deckbuilder. Admittedly, card balance isn't as good as in Dominion, there's less room for creativity and setups can go awry but I enjoy it while Dominion isn't enjoyable against experienced players anymore.
No comment on differences or improvements vs. the base game yet.

LIKES:

* More heroes, more village items, more monsters, what's not to like?
* More mini-expansions such as additional thunderstones, traps, and such.  The good thing here is that it is optional if you wish to add it or not!
* I like the mini-board for the dungeon.  Not needed but a nice touch.
* The XP chips are also a nice touch - much preferred over the cards.
* AEG has been wonderful about making expansions which fit all the cards so far - they have an excellent divider system.  Dominion and Rio Grande could learn a thing or two from them as their system is much less space efficient.

DISLIKES:

* While I have no idea, there is likely some caution to be used with traps and such as they can be unbalancing.
* As with all Thunderstones - you want to avoid a complete randomized setup - make sure you have appropriate village cards that will work with the heroes and monsters you select.

RATING: 5
If it wasn't for all the crappy art in this expansion it would have received a "10" but some of the art is just really really bad. Understandable why AEG couldn't couldn't continue using Jason Engle for every single card, but at least pick good art. The component quality is definitely getting better and better with the XP tokens and board, and the new cards really change the game up. Overall a pretty good expansion.

Dragonspire is the best Thunderstone set. For anyone getting into Thunderstone, buy this first. It is both an expansion and a base game, it is much more balanced than the base set, provides much needed strong monsters, 2 Guardians, and introduces the experience tokens, dungeon board, and the settings which add to replayability. I also love that they re-printed all randomizers with a different back. Every Thunderstone player should own this set.

RATING: 5
To say that this is better than Dominion is a lot like saying that being stabbed is better than being shot. It's trivially true but not all that impressive. But, nevertheless, it is better than the suckfest that is Dominion.

It's better than Dominion because it's got a better theme, the theme seems more integrated with what you're doing and the cards are more interesting. Ultimately, it's still an artificial exercise and an antisocial game, but it doesn't leave me as cold.

I think I could play this maybe three or four more times. But even one more play of Dominion would drain the last driblets of vital juices from my soul box.

Fun spin on a deck-building game.  Sometimes I wish it went more quickly.  But that could probably be fixed by picking the right card assortments.

Like the franchise but have found that it just take too long to play face-to-face and it lacks the excitement needed for the playtime required. As a stand-alone expansion Dragonspire brings some very interesting elements to the game - and I hate to keep harping on this but many of which will prolong the game. When it comes down to it I'd much rather play [thing=36218][/thing] or [thing=28143][/thing] instead. They play faster and provide a lot more flexibility as far as strategy.

Used to be my favorite deck shuffle building game.  I like the delving down in the dungeon and slaying monsters.  Only thing I don't like about it is the cheesey move to intentionally lose against a monster to put him at the bottom of the deck.  I feel like that was a bug in the design they should have fixed. We play house rules ... no cheese!

Suffers from the same problem as the base game.  Anything trying to capture the feel of a dungeon bash needs suspense.  The combat is too deterministic to give that, which kills the whole theme for me.  Polymorph's ability to swap for the top card of the monster deck helps a little, but not enough.

I like this game.  It reminds me of Dominion, but with a more interesting theme--and a theme that actually makes sense in terms of game play, which is a big plus.  I really like the artwork, too.  The box with its system of dividers is terrific for organizing the cards, making set-up and clean-up relatively painless.  What is lacking, but would've been nice, is a list of all the cards the set comes with.  Fortunately a fellow geek has provided such a list so one can verify having received all the cards one should have.  As for the rule book--don't get me started!  It needs to be reorganized and rewritten, with examples of play drawn from cards that are actually part of the set.  The middle school boys I played with really liked the theme, but seemed to find play a bit repetitious and dull.  It does take rather a long time to accumulate sufficient strength to begin defeating monsters, I thought.  (4+3)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.9
Awesome expansion or base game. The XP tokens are an excellent addition to the game. The large box size supports a hefty amount of cards from all preceding games...that is unless you sleeved them...in that case...still not enough room. Wonderful card art and in keeping with the entire set of Thunderstone cards.

RATING: 8
Haven't played enough to really see the difference between this and the original - they gave me much the same experience so my comments are the same as the original. It's an interesting Dominion clone with better story and substance, but with the downside potential of bogging down rather than accelerating to an end. Instead of aiming to buy more money and then buy VPs, here you buy weapon and hero cards which have both money and attack points. Depending on what hand you draw on your turn (ie lots of money or lots of attack), you buy better things and add 'em to your deck or you use your attack points to claim a monster card for VPs (also adding it to your now more clogged up deck). The amount of light points on your cards will dictate how far along the monster draft you can attack, and your heroes also may need strength points to be able to include weapon cards in your attack, so there's more things to check, manipulate and manage. As always, deck stripper powers are powerful. The potential bogginess depends on how the monsters come out vs how people have built their decks, with the potential of there being some near unbeatables and people therefore just doing buys rather than progressing the monster kill (which drives the end-game). Once you throw in expansion sets, obviously the game has a ton of variety and replayability. Your preference for this may come down to your tolerance of variable game length and perhaps a more uneven progression through the game - or call it improved storyline if you will.

Dominion was lacking something for me. Thunderstone has theme even though situations sometimes won't make sense like when you hire a Hero but he only randomly shows up every couple battles.

After watching Tom Vasel's video on his Epic Thunderstone variant, the game seems much better. It's more exciting not knowing what cards will come up next and this variant has been nagging me to purchase some expansions.

Good for solo too even though it's not as fun.

Makes a game I already love much smoother.  The board is very nice, especially when playing with new or inexperienced players.  The tokens are even more awesome than I anticipated... I can't count the number of times someone in my group has said "Oh, I don't think I got experience for some of those kills" or "ahhh man, I've already re-shuffled that card, does anyone remember how much experience I should have tkane?".  Now, you can easily put the XP tokens on the monster cards as the enter the hall - problem solved - and in a very COOL way.  The cards themselves are with great effects, nice artwork... lots of thought went into this stand alone / expansion and it shows.  I LOVE IT.

I've also played some games in solo mode where I used the 'Alone in the dark - Solo rules'. In general I can say that it's also fun in single player mode.

The 'Alone in the dark' rules offer three levels for solo play: 1.) Normal Level 2.) Veteran Level and 3.) Nightmare Level. I have played at least one game in each of these levels. My advice is not to play nightmare level but normal or veteran level. The nightmare level increases difficulty - that's o.k. as a challenge to see if you can beat it. But while increasing difficulty it decreases the flexibility in gameplay. I'll explain: In normal and veteran level you get a pause turn after you defeated a monster, meaning the monsters don't advance in the dungeon during your next turn even if you don't visit the dungeon. In nightmare level there is no pause turn. So with a hand that is good for the dungeon as well as for the village you are more relaxed to make a tactical decision. In nightmare level the advancing monsters urge you to visit the dungeon.
So my advice is, if you want to increase the difficulty, rather put in some more difficult monsters or traps and play veteran level avoiding nightmare level.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've enjoyed my games of this much more than I've enjoyed games with the base set, but a lot of my impressions from the original Thunderstone carry over to this new set.

While the theme in Thunderstone is a nice touch, and I like the dungeon crawl feel, I dislike how many turns you spend in this game that feel wasted. In a game like Dominion, you nearly always can do something on your turn, because the things you can do rarely change. It's just how GOOD of a turn you can have. In Thunderstone, I dislike how, even if you have a really good dungeon hand, when your turn arrives there may be no good monsters to defeat. It's like, using a Dominion example, you draw 16 money and the most you can buy is a 1 VP estate. All that deck optimization designed to get you good hands, and a lot of times it comes down to how the dungeon is laid out when it gets to your turn. 16 attack? oops, the newly drawn big monsters are immune to that type of attack, and you can only (over)kill the little one. Victory points are a bit too arbitrary and shifting in this game for my taste.

Also, it seems like there are too many turns where the only thing you can do is rest. I want to PLAY the game, not spend several turns passing... err... resting. I understand the tactical value of having a lean deck, but not being able to do something happens way too often to be enjoyable. I like the way Nightfall deals with this much better, where your starting cards are removed from the game after they are played.

Overall, Thunderstone: Dragonspire isn't a bad deck building game, and there are some fun mechanics, but I'd rather have more control over what to do on my turn, and let the deck I built determine how good my turns are instead of the game randomly determining whether my good hands are wasted or not.

The remarkable consistency of Thunderstone must be applauded. If Puzzle Strike perfected the short addictive deck-builder, then Thunderstone has shown how good a more long-form game can be. I love the setting and the art, and Dragonspire continues all of that.

But Dragonspire also makes some great improvements to usability, particularly with the Dungeon Board and XP tokens. It adds just a little bit, but the difference is very handy. And of course, room for more expansions is welcome.

Didn't grab me with any perceptible theme or improvement upon Dominion. It's a deck builder that loses you in the counting and counting and modifying and checking what's being modified. It's not like you really need to pay attention to your opponents either. The end rushes up without any tension. Turns don't really feel like you're making terribly difficult decisions. Money seems easy to come by at the beginning. Just a bit dull really.

7/28/11 - (3 solo plays) It's kinda fun solo... I think I probably like Ghost Stories better for solitaire play. TS seems to take twice as long to solo as GS does. TS seems to play a lot slower than Dominion, and there is a lot more math to it. It will be interesting to see how it feels with several players fighting over the dungeon. My biggest complaint is that I don't like the setting... I prefer traditional fantasy creatures. Not a huge fan of the artwork either. 

7/30/11 -  (5 solo plays) Nightmare play really speeds up the solitaire game, but it's damn hard. You wouldn't think it would be so difficult to get a strong deck going in 30 turns, but I'm losing by quite a bit.

You probably won't still find this Thunderstone stand alone title anywhere for under $100. It is certainly the best of all the base Thunderstone sets with tons of great monsters, characters and items to equip your heroes. It also contains a very useful dungeon board to stage your monster encounters and a great box design with a much better card racking system than the base game. Grab it if you can still find it for a reasonable price!

[1 play] I thought Thunderstone would be longer and more complex than Dominion, and I was right. What I also found out, at least as much as one play can demonstrate, is that it doesn't hold greater appeal for me in proportion to that length and complexity. So I think I'm happy not to wander into this universe unless bidden by the company of other enthusiasts.

I managed to acquire a complete set of Thunderstone + all expansions in 2012. In the epic variant (ever changing draw piles, never 100% sure how the market looks like), it has become a staple of our gaming ever since. 5 years (!) of repeated play against a competition of 200+ other games.. and still going strong.

I've tweaked all the decks so magic and weapons are now equally viable, with 'big dudes with big weapons' a tad easier to get into but magic having the stronger end-game. Mixed with clerics, archers en thieves when necessary there are now many variable strategies based on this fundamental choice: do I go magic or not. Great game, never bores.

As for 'vanilla' TS.. meh. It is Dominion set in a fantasy world. Less clean of design, much better in theme. But the fixed set of characters and items still makes it a ho-hum experience. Drop rating by 2.5 points.

Glad I managed to pick up a whole set so we can play the excellent 'epic' variant.

RATING: 6
Initial Impressions: If you know how to play Dominion you can play Thunderstone.  I'll describe it as Dominion with purpose.  I only played the base set of Dominion and became bored after 15 or so plays.  We shall see how TS goes.  I can already see the desire for more cards developing after one play.  Esh.  

I enjoy Thunderstone for the added mechanics of character leveling, easy card removal and a reason to buy cards in the village.  The feeling of generating a powerful deck to plow through the dungeon is well themed.  I did not really expect a good card efficiency engine game but it is present here with a fun fantasy theme on top.  So far, I like what I see.

Epic Thunderstone Variant : We played this and found it to be a nice slow build up to the endgame.  You can ignore worthless cards and really customize your deck.  I think I will fiddle with the monster order just to move the game along faster.  That is my one complaint with TS, that it can come to a halt when higher level creatures pop up and you are not ready.  With more play I'm sure we can get around this with better deck building.

update : Ultimately decided I just don't want to bother with set up or trying multiple variations to fix the game for us.  In the end it did not do for us what I thought it might.

Yes it has the bigger box and some additional dividers; it does NOT have the dividers for the Thunderstone base set -- you need to buy Wrath for those dividers. I have my Thunderstone base set, WotE, and Dragonspire all in the Dragonspire box.

Third expansion for Thunderstone, but has everything needed to play, so it can double as a base set. For new players this is the best place to begin collecting the game because you get lots of extra card types that were not available in the base set.

Dragonspire is, essentially, a re-boot of the base Thunderstone game, with an added board, experience tokens (instead of cards) and enough Hero and Village cards to play on its own. It was a great expansion for the base game, which is the way I looked at it, and I think it was the best thing to happen to the game before Advance came out.

Mostly the same as regular Thunderstone, so I will use the same comments as the one I leave for basic Thunderstone:

I find the gameplay cumbersome and lackluster. Sure, make sense get light to enter in the darker part of the dungeon, but the overall sense, for me, is that the game doesn't go foward. There are just to many turns of "waiting" (when I don't want to buy anything, to keep my deck slim enough, and also have no chance to go into the dungeon).

So the game takes longer, there is no more excitement than Dominion (you know that you will win a fight).

Thunderstone? No, just no.

The dungeon crawler theme is a nice addition in the deckbuilding genre. Tons of cards and play variants offer a lot of replayability. It is good fun, though mechanics are not as polished as they could have been. For example is too much information about the monsters already revealed before a player visits the dungeon. Rules, at least in the german version, could have been presented in a more concise way.

It often happens that expansions don't appeal to me because I feel that too often more complexity (albeit very little) is added, without making the game any better or more interesting. In the Thunderstone expansions released so far, I am not sure I like the idea of adding traps, guardians and dungeon features, but the additional heroes, monsters and village cards are most welcome.

Introduces a level 4 hero, and a new dungeon feature (settings.) As with any Thunderstone set, the game is pretty simple to understand, and the setup time isn't bad. Two of the heroes from this set seem very weak when used with only Dragonspire cards, but it plays well as a stand-alone. 

It also comes with randomizers from previous sets, with new backings, so they won't be confused for playable cards.

Picked this one up after playing T:Advanced.  I've enjoyed it but I'm done.

Have all pre Advance stuff except for Siege.  

Do not have the randomizer cards or xp cards any more, I just used the Dragonspire thunderstone pieces and the app to randomize.

Also, my copy of the werewolf promo is in german.  The app has the english text.

I got introduced to traps and treasures through this expansion, even though they had already shown up in previous expansions, and they can be a source of joy and frustration.  With the traps, at least they affect everyone when they come up.  That's no fun, but at least everyone's being hit at the same time.  I get that it's thematic for someone to get a fancy reward just for drawing it at the right time,m but it still feels a little off.  If there were more of a way to manipulate the dungeon to get the treasures, I might feel differently about them, but the benefits of the treasures aren't so great as to make them intolerable in the game.

As for the rest of the game, I haven't played anything that made the game so different in my eyes as to make it separate from the main games I've played, so it's still good as a source for creating random setups for different games.

Takes longer to play than expected, but as an old Magic player, I'm eager to explore the possibilities.
Expansions seem like a must for rounding out the experience.

The solitaire version is a lot of fun, but I just find the multi-player game lacking. With the rules as written it feels like an inferior game to Dominion, as Thunderstone is much longer with less bang for your buck. Sure, I love the theme and graphics of Thunderstone, as an old roleplayer it's tons of fun, but the gameplay just doesn't live up to its theme.

The [filepage=70684]Epic Thunderstone[/filepage] variant devised by Richard Lanius and evangelized and modified by Tom Vasel improves the game somewhat, but there is too little XP currency in the game when not being allowed to buy level 2+ Heroes and that slows the game down and takes the fun out of it. I've tried to address this with my own variant of [filepage=70684]Epic Thunderstone[/filepage].

Dragonspire's graphics, both art and design, are better than the first edition, and deserve a thumbs up.

The cards in Dragonspire are suffering a bit from power creep. Everything is overpowerful, which makes it a lot harder to kill anything. The game is no fun if half the players are sitting there with useless decks, and clearing the deck of useless cards is a slow process. I still like the franchise, but it takes more effort to prepare a decent game of Dragonspire than with the other sets.

That's not to say that I don't like the cards - they're really cool and I love playing with them. It's just more difficult for me to set it up with casual gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I love the things that Dragonspire adds: Experience counters, a box that also holds all the cards of the previous expansions, randomizer cards with different backgrounds for all existing cards, a board to place the encounters on, settings that give a dungeon a unique theme and a whole bunch of additional everything.

Ingenious minimalist card game, but I wonder how much game is really there.

The more I play these micro games the more I wonder whether I'm actually playing a game at all. It seems like most of the time there is no game and that you are just playing for the random times when someone can actually make a reasonable deduction and you see if it works out.

Very fun if your up for a quick little game. The rules are short, sweet, and to the point. I will say that the game is not very enjoyable if you only have 2 people playing, it is best played in groups of 4, and you can do a kind of 'tournament style' with 5.

A fast, very fun card game for 4.  My only dislike is that it only plays up to 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
So easy to learn, the game has some staying power in the meta-game (otherwise it falls over really fast). Drags super hard if people aren't judicious about their turns. The problem is since there isn't a particularly onerous amount of game here, I can't think of an occasion when I'd play this over something else; if I had 2p, wanted a small game, or I was short on time, I'd play Red7. If I wanted a quick social deduction game, I'd go for 3p/4p ONUW
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my favorite 4 player games.  Whenever you find yourself in a group of 4, this game can always be pulled out.  Very easy to learn and teach.  Although it is mostly luck, the game plays very smoothly and each player feels he has a chance at winning.  Not your competitive game, get another one for that.  Very non-gamer friendly, but gamers will love to play it still.

Great small little game. I was underwhelmed the first play through, but it actually packs a of of punch. A little bit like Old Maid, but it is great. 

UPDATE: Charm of the game has decreased for me a little bit because I am not a big fan of the limited number of strategies. 

UPDATE 2: Great game and very addicting. Lots of chance, but mad fun

For the life of me, I can't understand why this game demands such a high rating. There is barely a game here. I ranked it a four, my wife said I was being generous. I think she is right. Downgraded to a three.

How this is ranked so high on the BGG is totally eluding me. 

Few choices, early elimination, nonexistent strategy. Tic-tac-toe with good art.

RATING: 1
Player elimination + heavy luck factor + possibility of eliminating someone before they ever get their first turn = miserable excuse for a game.

Dat pasted theme tho.

Edit: Wow i am actually updating this from 1.5 to 1. Check out our last game with four players:
A plays Guard on first turn: "B, are you... x?"
B: "Yes."
Sits out for five minutes.
C plays Princess since, you know, you are Forced to sometimes. D asks: "Are you... Prince?" "Yes."
A and D exchange turns doing meaningless actions such as protecting their hand, looking at the opponent's, until one nabs the other with a Guard.
Winner: "I don't feel like i did anything; the cards played themselves."
WHAT A GREAT EXPERIENCE.

Love Letter, you're graduating to:
Literally not a game.

Bluffing/Deduction games distilled to an extreme.  Wherein other games make you pull off some brilliant ploy over an hour while others watch(and there's drama and tension and everything in that), this game basically gets you to one of those moments VERY rapidly, and as soon as someone pulls off something clever, the round is over.  Almost never ends in a boring reveal.

Best mini card game of all time? Could be!
As someone who plays alot of games and thinks they're fairly smart, I have often considered a game design of my own. Unfortunately I just can't come up with one.
Then I play games like this that are so great and yet so simple as well. Then I say to myself: "Why couldn't I think of this?"

Fun game, in the same vein as Coup for us (all about bluffing and surmising what your opponents have).  I like it, but am finding myself playing Lost Legacy more readily.

Innovative micro game that is like a handshake from modern game design.  The game is mostly a deduction/"take that" game, but the feeling of accusing someone and eliminating them on a hunch is ever so satisfying.  

There can be some wonky stuff that can happen and there isn't a lot of depth to this game at all, but the play time is so short that you really shouldn't expect an epic here.

Great little game. Has this really nice balance where it feels relaxed and low effort while still being engaging and fun.

Played this for the first time with my friends, despite having bought this for my step-sister for a holiday gift (never got a chance to play it with her yet, since we live half the US away from each other.)

The game was surprisingly fun, despite the fact that you are attempting to court the princess.  And it wasn't just fun because I handily won the first two rounds.  Other players did catch up, and in the round before the end of the game we were all tied.  It was great.  The final round concluded with two fast snipes using guards to correctly guess what other players held - it was impressive since for the entire rest of the game no one had used a guard to correctly guess someone on the first turn of gameplay.

All in all, I would play it again.  It was fast, complex enough to be interesting, with some nice deduction and not too much backstabbing.  (OK, I'm enjoying the backstabbing more... I sniped two player out of the game using guards - I had a really low hand but was able to hold my own until the end, it was great!)  

To continue with the sniping - I finally won a game by sniping both opponents in the last turn - using guards to protect the Princess I held in my hand.  It was great!  Especially since I was losing for the first half of the game... stealth to victory!

This game is crazy fun. It's blindingly fast, most rounds over in minutes, and requires some good deductive skills without being overburdened with too much to track. For such a small game there is a ton of fun and can be played by just about anyone, gamer or non-gamer.

This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite filler games (and from only 16 cards?!?!). It's definitely best with 3 or 4 players, though it can be a fun, very light filler with 2 as well.  It's highly addictive, and you can tell by how beat up my cards are.  However, it's totally worth it and more for only $10.  I will get this as a gift for others, and it makes a great stocking stuffer over the holidays .

Love Letter was my first experience playing a "Micro Game" and as far as I can tell it has set the standard for such games. It plays like a sort of twisted "Go Fish" with romance. You are each trying to woo a princess by drawing and playing certain cards which each have certain powers that help you acheive the simple goal of being the last person standing. While you would think that player elimination makes the game less fun, it resolves quickly enough that down time is minimal. The goal is to score 3 points by either not being eliminated or by correctly guessing who has the princess card in their hand. I like this game. It is elegant and easy to play with gamers and casuals alike.

Another instant classic in my house. You can teach it in 5 minutes, and while the game involves knocking players out, the rounds are so fast that nobody is ever out of the game for more than 45 seconds or so.

16 CARDS. This game is tiny, and yet, each card interacts with the others in unique and various ways. This game is simple but has immense replay value. It's a great game to introduce people to tabletop gaming, and simple enough that younger kids can still grasp it.

Highly, highly reccomend.

It's light, it's FUN, there is few elements of strategy and tactics but not too much to scare casual players. You can play it numerous time with the same pleasure and it's an excellent game that can bring expert and casual player at the same table and that means a lot to me. I tested it with different players and it worked all the time. This is one of the few games I rate 10

I love the "quick to learn" aspect of this game. While the game mechanic is simple, the strategy can be pretty complex in trying to out think your opponents. The ability to bluff and make decisions based on what you think your opponent is holding provides this game with a good amount of replay ability.

RATING: 5.5
I'm not a fan of this game and I find it fairly boring.  It is very heavily dependent on luck and there are really no choices to be made.  There is definitely some fun in it as randomness does result in some craziness but overall it is a pretty bland game.

Light, light, light filler that can go a tad longer than filler should.  Why so low?  Because in the game choice is an illusion.  To wit:

You hold in your hand two cards.  WHICH WILL YOU PLAY?!??  Well, if I play this one I lose so...  I PLAY THE OTHER!  And now who do I target with it...  ONE OF MY OPPONENTS!  And there's a small deduction element (which provides the ONLY hint of a whiff of anything resembling control) so I guess... KING!  Nope, go fish.  *sigh*  And my neighbor plays a card that takes me out of the round.

Thanks but no thanks.  Next game!

RATING: 8
The game is fun and we usually play it when we have some free time. It's amazing how you can have so much fun with only 16 cards.

The problem is that I sometimes feel that the game is a little too random and don't enjoy being quickly eliminated in plays of 4 people.

By the way, I hate having either the princess or the countess in my hand.

RATING: 6
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Love Letter is definitively one of the best micro-game I tried so far. Being someone who doesn't enjoy this kind of game, I have to say that I found Love Letter to be surprisingly interesting. It's still a pretty straight-forward game, but it has some elements of deduction, memory and bluffing, which spice things up just about enough.

That being said, it's still a micro-game... and I'm still not sold on these. I guess they could be a nice way to spend a few minutes, but I don't really see the point of playing something so shallow for those few minutes over just having a conversation. Therefore even if Love Letter might be one of the best micro-games out there, it still isn't my cup of tea. It's just barely OK.

Good filler. Easy to explain and more intriguing that one would think after reading the rules. We played very often at the begining and I am sure that we will go back to it. Still, once you know the characters and the dynamic of the game, the options become very obvious and there is little room for surprises. You soon realize that the number of decisions that you take in a game is not very high but the game is still fun.

It is one of the easiest to learn and funniest game to play. You have 16 cards with 5 characters, each with it`s special ability. You draw a card and play one card triggering it`s effect. The goal is simple: hold on to the Princess if you have it, or lose by revealing her. A perfect party game.

Can't believe this is just a 16 card game. I must give it credit for that.

Having said that, this game feels more like an exercise of a few friends sitting down for a nice cup of tea and picking up a few cards and having some fun guessing those cards much like using ESP with hints and feeling good that you got it right. (Eventually, the card counting will tell)

There is no other game that plays similarly, and no other game that plays this way that badly either. It was enjoyable not because of the game, but the fun in looking at your opponents facial expression on guessing those cards.

It's a party game of sort, one that is good for a play or 2. UNO would have lasted more plays.

Excellent jeu qui combine Déduction, Bluff et un peu de Stratégie. Cela se joue rapidement et je le recommande pour initier de nouveaux joueurs. Le jeu est assez léger, pas trop de cartes et ne dure pas trop  longtemps. Mais le temps que l'on y joue, c'est intense.

Il faut que votre lettre d'amour se rend a la princesse de deux manières. Soit vous avez la plus haute carte a la fin du tour, soit les lettres de vos adversaires ont été écartés. Et il faut gagner X fois pour remporter, tout dépend du nombre de joueur. Garder la princesse dans ses mains jusqu'à la fin du tour, c'est difficile.

Played this loads of times already and I just got it! My group would rate it highly. The light elements of bluffing and deduction are fun, the portability is great, and due to how fast the game plays (another plus), the higher level of randomness doesn't feel punishing. Sure, you can get eliminated in turn one if you're unlucky, but a round probably won't last longer than a couple minutes. And it's often pretty funny how you lose. A game that plays quickly, goes well with light trash talking, and doesn't leave any hard feelings - terrific.

Very underwhelming. My girlfriend were hoping for more decisions (2 cards only? Really?) and tension. Often, luck dictated our moves, so we didn't feel like we really won (or lost). The art is nice, so's the packaging. Will definitely try the game with 3+ players, to see how it plays.

Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2–4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!

RATING: 7
I have fun for what it is and the time it takes. As a gamer, it can be kind of annoying to be taken out by some random action of another player before you've even had a chance to do anything. There's a lot of luck! But it moves fast and it's a fun filler that only lasts five minutes or less per hand.

Only downside is sometimes after spending an ungodly amount of time setting up le big game, everyone is to sucked into Love Letter to want to play anymore.

Fun and each round is quick, great evening-ender.  Only downside is sometimes it takes a LOT of rounds before a winner is declared.  Even if you're killed off early, the round is over soon and another round begins, so it stays fun.

Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2–4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A delightfully simple game, particularly considering how it makes use of only 16 cards.  The aim is to eliminate the other players and be the last man standing with the highest value card, played super-fast across several rounds.  Combine bluffing, deduction, a modest amount of strategy and quite a bit of luck, and you have a quick, light, and easily accessible filler that is highly portable and loads of fun.

While I own the original I also have a pimped "Princess Bride" version that is a joy to play, as the characters so nicely match the roles.

I am baffled by its ranking on BGG.  Little to no control over what is happening.

UPDATE (01/01/2015): The family played this today with three players and it was much more enjoyable than I remember the game being.  True, there's not much "strategy" and very little decision-making, but it involves deduction, which I like, and is quick.  I'm bumping it up.

Love Letter is a party game which lack reply value. Definitely not my cup of tea, too much random and too few options. It generates a good laugh in the first few rounds, once everyone understands the game play there's not much left. With less than 4 players, it becomes a guessing game. It may appeal for to fans of Dixit and other games alike, but there are so many more better party games.

Imprescindible para las parejas jugonas. Deducción y estrategia. 

Ligero, muy rejugable y económico (relativamente). Las cartas tienen una calidad regular y recomiendo enfundarlas cuanto antes. El precio teniendo en cuenta los cubiletes y que son 16 cartas y las instrucciones, podría estar más ajustado. No obstante, muy buena mecánica.

Jugadores: para 2 es un tipo de juego, y para 3 o 4, es otro juego. Recomiendo 2 o 3.

A nice quick game, but one which relies almost entirely on luck (I failed to knock people out by guessing what others were with the Guard ability, but was almost always done myself in the same way after 1 or even no turns).

RATING: 6
Not bad, but not that interesting either.  Frankly, I think Coup is the much more interesting "very short" game.  Coup has some adrenaline and laughter in it.  This is a fairly weak smile by comparison.

This game felt like the central mechanic was the "guard card" (with 5 cards) wherein you are trying guess another player's other card.  Thus, about 25% of the game was spent trying to guess another player's card.  The amusement of that mechanic, at least for me, wears off pretty quickly, whether deducible or not.  I do not want to try to guess your card...any more.

Ich war etwas skeptisch, ob ein Spiel mit nur 16 Karten Spass machen kann. Aber nachdem ersten vollständigen Spiel zu zweit war mein Interesse geweckt. Bei den folgenden Spielen zu dritt war mir dann schenll deutlich geworden, dass in diesen 16 Karten eine Menge Spass stecken. Das Spiel ist sehr schnell erklärt, am Besten neue Mitspieler gar nicht lange mit Erklärungen quälen sondern einfach einmal offen vorspielen, danach kann es direkt losgehen. Ich bin mir sicher, das dieses Spiel häufiger auf den Tisch kommen wird. Dazu laden auch die schönen und grossen Karten ein.

I got this version by mistake. The cards of this US version are much smaler compared to the German cards. Therefore it is easier for traveling. However I prefer the larger German cards, if you have only one or two cards in your hand the cards should be at least large ;-)

I can't fathom what all the hype is about.  This is a complete non-game - the cards play themselves for awhile and eventually someone wins.  Every so often (maybe one round in five) there's an opportunity to make a simplistic, fourth-grade-level "deduction," but most of the time it's just thoroughly, profoundly random.

I gave this maybe half a dozen plays, really hoping things would click and I'd discover what it is that makes the game so popular.  Finally I concluded that while it's a clever concept, it's a terrible game.

I appreciate this game a lot for pushing forward the microgame movement. Very good filler with simple rules and a little bit of deduction.

To me though, the game does feel like it's limited to just 16 cards, and there isn't much game outside of those cards.  If anyone deduces what your card is, it's just almost always in your best interest to play it right away, which just limits the decision making on your turn and limits the power of deductions.

I've 'sold' this game as the most strategic card game you'll ever play with only 16 cards.  And in fact, there are really only 8 cards if duplicates are not counted.  So what makes it work so well?  It's super simple to teach.  Easy to grasp.  Highly portable.  And game play is quick.  You can play a short or full game as time permits.  Another game for the Every Gamer's Travel Pack(tm) collection.  Just not so sure that all the monopoly-like clones are doing the original any benefits though.

[ESP] Poco más se le puede pedir a un puñado de cartas. Mecánica muy sencilla, pero adictiva como pocas. La reducida duración de las partidas deja siempre las ganas de repetir. Buen 'filler' con el que podrás descansar entre sesiones de juegos más complejos.

Finally got to play this, I get why all the hype even if I think it's a tad overrated. It's kind of fun, but I don't really see it as "special".

It's a simple game that actually took a bit longer to play than I expected.

The two best things it has going for it is it's cost and size.

Been playing this all afternoon with my 14 year-old daughter and we absolutely love it.  It seems like it would work even better with 3 or 4 people, but we had a blast with just the 2 of us.  It was easy to learn and had a fun mix of strategy and (mostly) luck.  It reminded me a lot of Guillotine.  I can't wait to play it again!

Pretty damn good for a light game. I feel like it's pretty deep, has some hefty strategy and bluffing.

RATING: 10
One of the best fast paced game you can ever play.
Plays best at 4, still enjoyable at 2.

The Kanai Factory Edition (with the original drawings) is the best one *opinion totally biased* ;-)

Best thing: You can play it anywhere at any time (in public transports, at the office, during lunch, etc).

You want to play just for 5min? No problem! 20min? Sure!

Good fun to play.  Just 16 cards.  Get your letter to the princess by containing/retaining the highest value card.  With four players, first game score 4,3,3,2.  So all players were in with a shout, but maybe a few minutes too long when scores are so even.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
Very nice filler. Only 16 playing cards, plus 4 summary cards, and 13 cubes make an excellent little game. Very easy concept. You have 1 card in your hand at all times, on the start of your turn you draw 1 more, then discard 1 of the 2 cards and execute it's text. When the round ends the player with the highest numbered card wins the round.
As cards are discarded you're able to deduce what players are holding in their hand. Supports only from 2 to 4 players unfortunately.

Ok, sometimes are terrible combinations: having the princess early in the round is always a problem, near the end of the round if you have the King and draw the Princess you probably are going to lose the round (unless they give you a Guard or a Prince), having 2 Baron cards is always risky (50% chance), when you discard the Countess you most likely have the Prince, King or Princess, especially later in the game, when you have the Baron and the Princess you have to play the Baron and if the other player has a high card you are pretty much exposed, (if the other player discards a 5, your chances of winning are drasticaly reduced - meaning you have a 6,7 or 8, if those haven't already been played/discarded).

since games can take around 10 rounds, I've played this around 10*20=200 game rounds. Which is a lot for a game with this complexity, since a round is essentially the game.

Love letter is quite a strange little beast. It's bare bone and most of the times it plays you rather than being played. There's some deduction, but c'mon, what can you really do with a hand size of ONE plus the turn card?
And it is a game WITH PLAYER ELIMINATION? You must be kidding...

BUT.

This game is really more fun than it is supposed to be. And it's so quick that player elimination doesn't bother. And it is made with just 16 (with only 8 unique) cards and a handful of cubes...
Love Letter is truly showing what an ingenious designer can put together with essential materials and talent and inspiration!

Initial Impression: A nice filler game with minimal components. This is a quick deduction game that's as easy to teach as it is to play. The short playtime ensures that you can't stop after just one play.

10 Games: Still an enjoyable game. It's currently one of our 8 yr old daughter's favorites and she often requests it after dinner. Although the game has some "take that" to it, the rounds are so short and the promise of more guarantee that the players are not invested in any particular round. Eliminating a player doesn't result in any hard feelings or desires for revenge.

RATING: 9
Raising my score from an 8 to a 9. The reason is not that this is the perfect game. The reason is that it has never failed to entertain any group of people I play it with. That's a 9 in my book.

Another UPDATE: I feel I should post another update to my feelings on this game. It is EASY to pull out and play. And it is easy to teach. I have pulled many friends into this game. I even finally got my wife to play. It is a hit every time. This game should be in every collection.

UPDATE: Finally got my daughter to play this several more times and now it's an easy one to pull of the shelf.  We both love how quickly it plays and the deductive component.

This score is based on a single play.  My 13-year-old got this game from a family member for her birthday.  I finally made her take it out and play it with me so she knows the rules the next time she has friends over.  She did her usual bored attitude while I read the rules and kept it up for the first six rounds.  Then something clicked.  She realized that this was a game of deductive logic and strategy and it's quick and simple.  That's her kind of game.  So, she excitedly managed to win the next three rounds in a row before I finally got her on a lucky guess with the guard.  She rated it a 6, but I think once she has taught it to some friends and played it a few more times, that score will go up closer to a 7.  It's nothing special, but it is very portable and extremely easy to learn if you just jump in and try a few rounds.

It's hard to count how many times we played this. I remember the conversation before the first game "What? You want to play something that's called LOVE LETTER? Nope, nope, nope.". Oh, how wrong some of us were. Who would have thought this game will be SO GOOD! It's fast, interesting and almost never gets boring. Without any doubt, one of the best filler-games ever made. It's super cheap so there is no reason not to have one. Go get it now!

It's no surprise this tiny little game has become a behemoth. It's very easy to teach, has interesting decisions, and it's quick. Sure, there's player elimination and luck is a factor but that gets offset by it's sub-5 minute playtime and it's frequent "a ha!" moments. It's the quintessential filler game.

The game that started the whole microgame craze. I like LL quite a bit, but after 20 plus plays, I feel that I've seen just about everything it can do. You can really get screwed over with a random bad draw (Baron/Baron comes to mind) but the game is so quick it really doesn't matter. This will stay in my collection as I think I could use this as a springboard with new players to bigger and better things.

They don't come any lighter than this.

While I like it with the right count and the right group of people, I can't bring myself to click the BGG "Become a fan" button.

It's amazing for what it accomplishes with so little, but really, would you rather have an amazing go-cart or an average car in your driveway?

The amount of love this game gets on BGG is as apropos as was Obama's Nobel Peace Prize.

Fun at four players.  Not great at three, about as fun as a coin toss with two.

I enjoy the Kanai Factory Edition for the artwork and for the Minister card.

Is this one of the best games of all time? Well, erm, no, yes. Kind of. Of course not! No, truly it is great.

This is such a light game by my normal taste but I find it so clever, so fun to play. I am happy to play this any time and for me it is quite possibly a landmark, classic modern game.

I do prefer Lost Legacy, but there is room for both.

Delightfully breezy little game. Plays in a flash, and with a bit of bluffing and guessing going on it can be a very social game. Will have the table bursting into laughter when, for the third time in a row, someone correctly guesses that one player has The Baron in their hand (it's always the Baron), eliminating them from the round. Great fun.

Isn't it remarkable what a good designer can do with only 16 cards. This game had me hooked from the very beginning, because it gives you that nice feel of reading your opponents, and plays fast. In some odd way it reminds me of We Didn't Playtest This At All because with the play of a single card someone could easily be eliminated. This keeps the game from taking long, and definitely gives you that "let's play again" feel. I particularly like that there can be some deduction as you watch what cards have been played, and figure out what cards might be remaining in your opponents' hands. I almost wish they added a few more cards in order to make it work for more players. That could be my biggest nitpick with this game, because it feels like one of those fun light games that I'd like to bring out even with a party gaming group, but it only plays up to 4. Still, that's such a minor complaint for a good game.  It won't necessarily become a classic that people are playing for generations, but it is certainly a good, solid title that I will keep in my collection.

I really enjoy this little game for what it is. I think it shines best at 4 players, particularly if each player considers some higher level strategy. There is a surprising amount of depth in that deck of 16 cards for those who look. It becomes less enjoyable playing with people who don't want to work their brains a bit and strategize. They can come off feeling "meh" about the whole experience. Sometimes luck can play an overbearing factor in ones victory or loss, but each round is lightning fast enough that elements of luck don't detract from the fun.

After playing Love Letter too many times I got convinced it isn’t that bad people don’t write love letters anymore: now I only complain they didn’t stop earlier. (November 2012)

[b]Update I[/b] - As it shows through my original comment, my first contact with Love Letter was terrific: it was explained badly and the following games were even worse, devoid of any fun.

Yet, after playing it massively with a suitable group of light-hearted gamers, Love Letter got better and better: now it’s showing its true nature, that of the good and light filler packed with fun and laughter it was meant to be upfront.
Hence in December 2012 I raised my rating from 3 to 7.

[b]Update II[/b] - Lots of loud fun in just sixteen cards: Love Letter is such a little gem!
Thus, after (massively) playing it further, in November 2013 I raised my rating from 7 to 9.

As fillers go, it's a good one.  Quick and fun but not without choice.  Some deduction and bluff.  No, it's not heavy or meaty and sometimes you forced into making a move you do not want but really, who cares.  You aren't playing this for an hour.

Érdekes egy játék, nem gondolná az ember, hogy pár kártyából ilyet ki lehet hozni. Igazából nagy a szerencse faktora és inkább a többiek hibáit kihasználva lehet megnyerni a játékot. Jó megfigyeléssel és árulkodó jelekkel is lehet előnyt szerzeni. Pókerarcok előnyben.

// I'm not a big fan at all of player elimination in games,
 but rounds go quickly enough that it doesn't feel too 
harsh. Typically we only play to 3 points though since
the game gets a little boring/samey after a while. Not a
bad game, but not a favorite, either. Looking forward to
Love Letter: Premium to see how that changes things up.

A social deduction game with a tiny number of cards (roles).  I don't like social deduction games, especially when they have very few roles/actions and every man for himself.

What a charming little family game. I love how it invokes in a small way some of the moments my hard-core gaming group enjoys (bluffing, deduction, table-talk) in such a shockingly simple package. I don't see ever bringing it out in the group, but this will be a favorite with my daughter and wife for some time to come (easy out, small footprint, play as long as you want). I don't think you can reduce gaming to a smaller denominator in many of these categories and be so fun.

40 plays: 

A real gem of a super light, casual game. Very fast to learn. Only a tiny bit of strategy involved, and playable with no strategy at all, so it scales to all ages.

Theme is delightful, if a bit clunky. I do wish cards had been added which included real love letters, just to hold in your hand next to your one card to clarify that that card indicates who currently holds your love letter, rather than who "you" are. 

It does feel at times like several turns will go by without requiring very interesting decisions. And skilled gamers will find it basically a "solved" game like tic-tac-toe. But the simplicity, quickness of play and pleasant theme make it a good casual game for all ages.

I understand that gamers who play this may be disappointed; there's not much of a game here. But it has a je-ne-sais-quoi that make it continue to compel us to play it and introduce it to others.

It should be mentioned that the art is just a tiny bit risqué, which is a surprising decision. But my daughters don't seem to have noticed.

Love Letter is a nice gateway game that introduces players to deduction mechanics without paralysis. Its easy to teach and doesn't overwhelm players with vast decision making.  

Despite my opinion that this is a good gateway, I do not think that it is a good filler. First to four affection cubes in a four-player game is quite long and even longer given the inevitable "king of the hill" gameplay. 

After you play a few rounds and everyone has a few cubes, you just kind of want the repetitiveness to be over. I don't know why it has a 20 minute playing time.

Got for my mother for christmas as a stocking-stuffer type game.
Was quite fun, but it took a bit of time to learn the rules. It was pointed out that the game could be (more or less) played with regular playing cards, but I think it would lose some of it's intrigue if this happened.

Would play it again to get the hang of it, and hopefully more times after.

Juego de deducción. Hay 16 cartas numeradas. 5 con el 1, 3 con el 2, tres con el 4, dos con el 5, 6, 6 y 8. Cada carta permite hacer ciertas acciones con otros jugadores, o interactúa con la otra carta que tenga el jugador. El juego consiste en no ser eliminado y sobrevivir con la carta de mayor valor. Sencillito a tope, pero probablemente resultón para 5 o 6 jugadores.

Getting my wife to play games with me is a very delicate thing and there are two occasions where I have done myself an injustice. The first was involving her in a five-player game of Mousquetaires du Roy, the second was getting her to play a few quick rounds of Love Letter with me before we had company over one day last year. It was a disaster, she hated it. She looked up at me and said "what's the point?" and then she said, I probably hate this more than that Musketeers game you made me play. She's very finicky and I had built up a solid foundation with games like Jaipur, Mr. Jack and Boss Monster; but this 2-player Love Letter episode may have done irreparable damage. I've played it once with four and seen it played with four as well and think it's a solid, quick little game; but avoid the 2p experience!

RATING: 7
Rated for balance of cards and length of play. Only 15 cards to play to complete a round, meaning only 3 or 4 decisions per round at most if you are not eliminated. That is not a negative, because 4 rounds (4 player) are required to win the luck factor is reduced. Bluffing can help to protect your hand, and the prevalence of Guards (5) and the 2 Priests help to weed out the stronger characters. The most interesting game out there, with the least components. Nicely done, and popular with all gamer types. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my go-to games when I either don't have space or have people at my house who don't play games.

It's simple enough that pretty much anyone can play it. I love the bluffing element and the double guessing that goes into it too. It's fun watching the lightbulb turn on for people after the first couple hands.

I personally think the theme is brilliant because of how silly and girly it is. My guy friends usually turn their nose up at it the first time they play and then the next time they come over are saying "Let's play that princess game!"

This is one of the best gaming purchases I've ever made...go buy it!

RATING: 7
   A super quick, portable, easy-to-teach game with just enough intrigue to captivate (ideally) 3 or 4 players.  There are only 16 cards, so it's probably not necessary to leave all played cards exposed - but it's a good idea to do so if you're playing with newer or younger players.

   We also have Letters to Santa, which offers a bit of seasonal fun - and I have seen a few re-theme variants; but having played Lost Legacy, I prefer it over Love Letter.

RATING: 8
This game comes and goes in waves for me, but whenever I come back to it I am pleasantly surprised. A true classic in a small package, very engaging, and super approachable, just a joy to play every time, even after I think "maybe now I'm done with Love Letter," a new group injects new life into this game for me.

RATING: 2
After 2 games, the game grates and is stale as dishwater. The intra-game is so repetitive and boring. How can you keep playing this game again and again? There simply aren't many meaningful choices to make. Often you're eliminated by complete random chaos. (And I don't mind luck in games).

Can't decide which is worst, Love Letter or Coup.

Surprising how much there is to consider at times. Of course, other times the cards play you and you can also be knocked out of a round without even having a chance to play. It's not a heavy game, but is pretty enjoyable for what it is.

I'm not sure how I'll feel playing with the original rules for the 7-card. Definitely worth a try.

Given that this set comes with 2 alternate prince(sses), I'm really surprised they didn't include an alternate 7-card to allow play either way. Seems like a missed opportunity.

In any case, I love the artwork of this edition - looks nice next to Chronicle and Cheaty Mages!

The velvet bag catches everyone by surprise.  But ladies always seem keen to play and most people want their own copy after 1-2 rounds.  Tire of the many re-themes.  1 copy gifted to Caleb and Elieen (wedding edition), 1 copy gifted to Bagram Game Group, 1 copy gifted to Jon and Angela.

Love Letter is a fun little game that is easy to teach and quick to set up. We have used this game to get some friends who speak English as a secondary language into board games, who now play it with their friends don't speak English. 
Obviously a crib sheet for this game is mandatory if using the English cards when you have limited English, but the simple rules makes it an easy barrier to get around.

Can give you an empty feeling when your eliminated just because of a random card you drew. It also has elements of simple games such as war and go fish. However, it does feel like you make strategic choices as you can lose a round just because you played your card wrong.

At first glance, [b]Love Letter[/b] looks too simple.  There are only sixteen cards in the deck.  The game is played until one player wins a set number of rounds (depending on the number of players).  A player wins a round by possessing the highest numbered card at the end of the round, or by knocking out all his opponents (more likely).

LL is a perfect balance of logical deduction and luck.  I suspect, however, that it may become a little repetitive.

Love Letter loses a lot of it's appeal as a 2 player game. In fact, I'd say don't play it if you only have 2 players, and there are plenty of other and better games for 2 players out there.

As a 3 or 4 player game I like the very simplistic design of Love Letter, the games are so fast that even when you're bumped out of a round it's not a big deal. May annoy players who get bumped more than once though. I really enjoy it with the max amount of players. I would recommend this because of its simplicity and I believe it would be a very easy game to get people to play. It makes a great gateway game, I feel.

Surprisingly fun for a game of just 16 cards.  It plays quickly and is easy to learn--both nice features.  However, I think once you move up the learning curve, a lot of the games start to feel the same, so I'm not sure about replayability.  

A comment on the player number polls:  I agree the game is best for 3-4, but I don't understand why 60% of people say the 2 player game is "not recommended."  It's still quite fun -- at least, it is not THAT inferior to the 3-4p game.

This game is not only just a filler game. Love Letter is designed to be a very simple game that involves luck and deduction. The player needs to manage his hand properly in order not to get eliminated. The simplicity will be really friendly for the newcomers. I usually play this game with those who have their first step into board gaming. It has depth and thematically it leaves the good impression of the Renaissance era.

I don't get this one. Well, OK, I get that it's a really short, really simple time-killer that you can play with kids, and the idea of delivering love letters is nice. But as a game it's pretty trivial, very random, the setting is thinly drawn, and I want games that are going to do more than fill time. Not sure how or why it set the world on fire.

I've enjoyed this more if you play it with a memory element, covering over previously-played cards. Then at least there is a modicum of skill involved (memory being a skill), and it adds a little tension. The designer does explicitly says all previously-played cards should be visible, but I think he's wrong on that. With totally open information it's pretty trivial (for adults anyway) and a bit tedious.

I'm really not a fan of bluffing or deduction, so this game just plain isn't targeted at me.  I can see why it would be appealing to a lot of people though, as it would be a great quick filler if you're into the mechanics.

For me personally, any amount of bluffing in a game just feels more like guesswork, and deduction generally requires too much memory for my tastes, even if it's a small amount of memory.

While the game is super quick, I'd rather just spend the time doing nothing.  Most people will probably like Love Letter more than I do though!

As with bowling, I tire of this game after 3 rounds.  Stick to the original rules, not the AEG ones.  If you want a little more treachery, play until someone scores 2 or 3 tokens.  For longer games stick to AEG's scoring suggestion.  If everyone is playing deductively, they will just knock down the person likely to win early on causing the tokens to be distributed evenly.

Interesting card game that plays fast yet offers some thought.  There's an interesting psychological element in this game where you take known information and try to determine what other players are holding.

It's worth noting that the game is much better with 3 or 4 and is terrible with 2.

Quick micro game in which you are trying to get your letter delivered to the princess.

If you have kids I highly suggest the Christmas version, Letters to Santa.

Love Letter is the perfect game for so many situations.  I play it with my team, as a lead in to my team meetings.  I play it with my wife.  I play it with my game group as a filler.

Un juego de relleno muy entretenido y excelente para la familia. La mayoría del tiempo se trata de deducir la carta que pueden tener los otros jugadores, y al contar cada partida de varias rondas hace que uno quiera seguir jugando y evitar que el jugador que va a la cabeza siga ganando.
Cada ronda se juega rápido.

Lots of people love this for the simplicity, but I find that there's not enough to do in this game. Sometimes no matter what you get, it is impossible for you to win - but the short rounds might make up for that.

Phenomenal depth and believe it or not strategy in this incredibly small package. Coup has the upper hand in bluffing and strategic flexibility but also at the cost of some unwanted side effects in its system. Love letter is simpler and doesn't reward passivity, even if it may reward luck at times.

Just OK as a 2 player game - too much luck, not enough skill/strategy.  Will have to give it a try with 4 to see if it's any better.

RATING: 9.7
Genius at work...16 cards...never has so much been done with so little.  I also love how the game evolves...for instance, if you always play a 3 with a high card, you give too much information...eventually, you start taking more risks hoping for the opponent to have a 1.  Standard play is developed than deconstructed to meta play then eventually back to a new standard play, etc.

Love Letter is light, wonderful filler.

It plays quickly, eliminates players, but does not keep them sitting on the sidelines for long, and keeps players guessing as to who is closest to the Princess.

RATING: 8.5
There need to be more games with this quality of strategy that can be played in under 30 minutes. Unfortunately, it seems that designers now think that in order for a game to appeal to strategy players, it has to last at least 2 hours. Not true.

Love letter is good. It's quick, fun, and requires some thought and bluff. But I can't for the life of me understand how it rates more highly than Coup City State on BGG. The latter seems to play differently every time, offers far more bluffing, strategy, subterfuge and decision making than Love Letter. After playing several times, it becomes clear that there isn't much variety in how the game plays out.

There is an indisputable element of luck in this game, but it is one that I can happily handle on account of the fact that it balances between players, and since rounds last only a couple of minutes, a stroke of bad luck is quickly brushed aside. Nevertheless, hitting the bad luck of ending the round by drawing the unwinnable King/Princess combo is, to my mind, a bit of a design flaw.

It's a nice game. It's a fast game. It's a game that brings smiles AND satisfies the serious strategic gamer in me. But it's not Coup.

When I hear the term "microgame," I basically think of Coup and Love Letter. Now having played both, I give the slight nod to Coup for entertainment value.

Love Letter is fairly impressive for creating a game with only 16 cards, but if I'm honest about the game experience, it's pleasant enough but takes up enough time that I'd rather be playing something else. I had hoped that it would involve more deduction. Instead, in too many rounds, someone can get shafted by an unfortunate draw, and the whole thing feels just a little bit too random.

Update: traded this one away. One play was enough for me to know that I've got better games to play in the time it takes to play this.

The ultimate filler game, everyone has 1 card and your turn you draw a card then play a card and hope to not be eliminated. It plays really fast, but I can't help but think of other micro games that are better than this. Khmer/Elements if you have 2 people, Red7 with more, and also some of the other small dice games like Qwixx or Bang Dice. For how short it is I don't mind playing it, but bluffing is not fun to me so it becomes more an activity to me.

You really need to pay attention to every card play but you also need to watch for other clues as well (comments, facial expressions, etc.).  

Amazing that a 16 card deck could pack so much punch.

Great for gamers and non-gamers.

I can't think of any game that went from me liking it to disliking it more than Love Letter. At first I loved how easy it was to teach, how portable it was (the tuckbox and paper tokens I made made it ultra portable), and how approachable it was for non-gamers.

Now the game just feels like it plays itself since there's never difficult decisions to make, and I've found other portable games that I find more enjoyable and/or strategic. Also, the theme just doesn't make any sense. Reading the intro in a rulebook should enhance a game, not add confusion. I still find the art on the Kanai version pleasing though.

I've seen people claim Love Letter is their favorite / the best game of all time and that really baffles me.

I've only played it two player so far which was okay but I suspect it would be much more interesting with three or four. Still it's a great production at a great price point.

I received this for Christmas last year, and although it was super fun to start with, it lost it's appeal after a little while. It's not a bad game, great to store in a hand bag (which is what happened for a while) but it's not something that gets pulled off the shelf too often. I also own the batman version. It's just a bit to 'same-y' after a while. Definitely repetitive.

I love playing this game.  Not because it is a stellar game, but because it is so easy and quick and everyone else loves it.  It has been a great conversation game that plays with anyone I want to spend time with. Usually I can introduce them to something else a little more challenging later (Perhaps in the same day/night since it is such a quick game)! Can't argue when someone who usually doesn't play many games says, "lets play that again"!

RATING: 8
I'm not sure if this game is great, or if I'm just flabbergasted that someone would release a game that only consists of only 8 different cards, 16 cards total (and a few cubes). This game has player elimination, even before they have any choices, but it's fast enough that it seems ok to me. But I sort of suspect that after a little time this will fade fast, and only be pulled out as a novelty, and when we really only have 15 minutes. Shame that it only scales to 4. 

Update: still going strong. Gets requested. Especially by my non-gaming daughter. This is perhaps a gateway game to gateway games.

Update: Ok, raising rating to 8. It almost feels silly to rate such a minimal game an 8.

This is possibly the only game I own where the packaging costs more to manufacture than the contents.

I prefer a merge of the Japon/AEG rules: Countess rules from AEG, Handmaid rules from Japon (may be targeted, but nothing happens).

I bought two copies of this to provide components for 5+ player games. 

But having played it a few times, I actually prefer the Minister to the Countess. He's a high risk card, like the Princess, but it isn't just "throw away an obvious card and see who guesses what I've got", it's "keep the second best card and risk being eliminated by myself"

This small filler (16 cards) is addictive. One game
is not enough. On our first try we ended up playing
for over 90 minutes. This just grabbed us and we couldn`t
stop playing. This will be added to my permanent collection of games I always take with me in any family
situation. Have made a miniature version measuring 65mmx44mm (Inkl.mini hearts) , so its a perfect fit even in my wallet.Every true gamer should have this on them.
This designer will be checked for other nuggets of gold.

How can a game with so few cards be so much fun?  No need to sit and puzzle over it, just dive into this clever game with ridiculously simple rules.  Draw a card, discard a card, always keeping one in your hand.  The discarded one has an associated action which helps you try to ferret out your opponent's identities and get them eliminated from the game.

If you go for light, simple games that are fun with a group, then this is a must-have.  I know I'll be trying to grab a copy at the first opportunity!

Love letter is a fun little pocket game. It is great to get people that are entirely new to gaming on to something other than standard playing cards. a gateway to a gateway game. Very few cards and simple rules, easy to play with kids and fun every time I play it. I give it an 8 because there it becomes repetitive after a single play through so not one I would play over and over the same night, however, works fantastically as a filler game or a quick not too thinky game to play on the couch while you are watching a movie or something.

I'm a big fan of bluffing games and this one combines the good parts from Citadels(hidden characters with different powers) with a much shorter play time because of the lack of construction cards(usually around 10-15 mins).

I played it with a lot of groups(gamers and non-gamers) and it caught on rapidly, up to the point where gaming sessions got 1 hour longer because people wanted to play more than 1 game round.

The down side is that it's only supports 4 players, would have proffered 5 or 6 as it is a party game.

Interesting how you can make a playable game with only 16 card. It can be fun, but you can't take it too serious - very often you will have feeling you can simply throw a dice to determine the winner of the game instead of playing it :o) But if you have 10 minutes of spare time and you want to play a game, there probably aren't much better choices.

RATING: 6
Components: Good graphic design; pleasant, thematic art; readable rules.

Experience: With two players, doesn't really seem to work. Not very much deduction; lots of guessing; mostly obvious what to do.

With three players, a bit more going on, trying to survive while other players duke it out. A bit more deduction.

There is some careful deduction and subtle misleads you can employ in this game.  Nevertheless, I find myself wanting to play Coup instead.  My rating is therefore somewhat lower than the intrinsic quality of this game merits because it's simply less enjoyable than a similar card-based, bluffing filler.

But the design is so coldly (warmly?) seeking a sort of perfection (which it nearly attained!) it- just- doesn't- make me admire it like I do the messy, loveable sort.

Deep strategy with tons of number crunching and countless paths to victory.

...or not.

This game is simple.  I mean S-I-M-P-L-E simple.  You have two options each turn, and you choose one of those options.  Sometimes you are guessing blindly, and sometimes you have a little more information and are able to play tactically.  But most of the time, you are just making your best educated guess (and sometimes you're just plain guessing).  But who cares?  The game is fun, quick, and playable by anyone, meaning that even non-gamers can get in on the action.

RATING: 6.5
A good and fun game for the first few playthroughs considering it's a deck of just 16 cards. Unfortunately this also means that multiple replays reveal the limited amount of gameplay outcomes.

For a while we had a house rule that if you accidentally play a card against a player with Handmaid in front of them you get eliminated. This resulted in humorous situations but also frustration. :)

UPDATE: As long as you understand it's "just" a light filler, it's very good.

Loot Letter ENG
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Love Letter is a small game that packs a lot of punch. While suitable for two, it really shines with 3-4 players. I have had nothing but positive remarks when this game has hit the table.

What really sets this game apart is how easy it is to pick up by non-players. After only one round, everyone at the table understood everything they needed to enjoy the rest of the game, and eagerly awaited their next move. It can be unfortunate when one person gets kicked out of a round without getting to do anything because an opponent wins a showdown against a first-move Baron, but the rounds are so fast that no one gets knocked out for long.

For such a small and portable game, there is a LOT of gameplay here.

That said, the gameplay is not novel enough to warrant limitless play-throughs, as the number of player options that can occur are very limited. Compare this with Coup (another 15-card microgame), which adds a bluffing mechanic that makes rounds significantly more strategy-based. So, Love Letter can get repetitive if played too much, unlike more social/strategy-based games that you can go back to endlessly, but I don't think it needs to be that type of game.

Love Letter is a perfect game for a casual get-together with friends, busting it out every once and a while.

Pros: Neat art and a decent amount of decision space for the size of the game. Small element of bluffing. Great to introduce newbies to gaming. Fast playing and easy to transport.

Cons: So many editions to choose from.

Quirky theme. Quick filler card game with a small bit of deduction. Replayability comes from not playing this too often. With the premium edition, it enters true party game status and trades off ease of teaching and quickness of play for larger player count and more card effects. Still one of the best filler games in existence.

Great filler game.  Quick to learn and easy to ease a new player into.  Loads of luck, but still some obvious strategies become apparent.  Excellent with the right group.  I've had a lot of laughs playing this with friends.  Theme is easily the weakest part of the game, as it makes little to no sense based on the actions of the cards.  This does not subtract any of the fun from the game though.  This game constantly makes it to the table and is certainly worth the tiny price tag.

This is about as deep a game as it's possible to have using a deck of 16 cards. Which is not to say that there's that much to it, but it is surprisingly interesting.

I am tempted to rate it higher, but at heart it's still a quick filler.

[April 2017 - 8.8] Fine-tuning the rankings. This is still a go-to game for me when there's 10 minutes at the beginning of game night or as casual game in a bar, so it remains pretty high in my rankings despite its simplicity.

[February 2015 - 9.0]
Still hanging strong for me, even though it slipped a notch. Some other short games (such as For Sale) have given it competition in my collection, but Love Letter is still the game I pull out when time and space are an issue, and people like it a lot. Again, such a great game for so few cards.

[July 2014 - 9.1]
Love Letter -- perhaps purposely so -- is one of those games where you're playing at a bar and people come up to ask what you're playing.  "Uh, you say with some hesitation and slight embarrassment, it's called 'Love Letter' ... and look at this luxurious red bag it comes in!" No wonder the publishers are coming out with different themed versions.  Joking aside, Love Letter is the perfect game for any downtime at the bar, the airport, or while waiting at the DMV. A few plays in and most everyone has a good chance to win. I'll be interested to see if they ever expand it with new cards to the base set of 16. I can't decide if that would improve the game or ruin it.

I don't really know why I like this game as much as I do. It's a very short filler with some bluffing and deduction. You can be out of round without having a chance to do anything, there's quite a bit of luck in the card draw and you can't really plan ahead. But somehow, it's just a lot of fun to play. Great, great filler!

Ahhh love letter. It seems like an amazing game based on the popularity but soon you realize you aren't playing the game, the game is playing you.

The strategy gets dull quickly and I will always protest playing if I have other games on hand. But it's very new player friendly and perfect for a small travel game so I'll give it a 6.

Nice lightweight game played using only a few cards, which represent roles a player can take on.  When the game lets you do so, you can occasionally have some interesting bluff related decisions to make.  But just as often the game forces your hand, and have no choice.  Any time you have the princess card, you have no choice, for instance.  Toward the end that can just mean you lose.  Plus, there are the guard cards, which may mean loss anyway.  So in the end it just felt very chaotic and random, things I wouldn't normally enjoy.  That it only took fifteen minutes redeemed it somewhat.

this isn't worth even looking at as a two player game.

RATING: 8
So far I have only played this as a 2 player with my wife but I very much enjoy the game and the concept.  The game was super simple to pick up and understand and the version we got came with customized card sleeves which was a nice touch.  Gameplay is fast and easy to learn (we put all the cards in the protectors, read through the rules, set the game up, and played to completion in less than an hour).  I could also see how playing with numerous people could definitely increase the intensity of the game.  Will definitely be playing again!  

Only downsides I would say are that at times the game is entirely luck based and there are situations where a round is impossible to win which can make those rounds feel unbalanced, but such is life right?

Love letter is a light deduction / bluffing game.  I love the concept, but I think there is room for improvement on the implementation.  Sometimes very little information is revealed about anyone's cards in a round, which makes the round seem random and pointless.  And sometimes the game over stays it's welcome a little when you play to 4 points, at least for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A quick little filler. Explain it in a minute, start playing, takes about half an hour or less.

Who?
Basically, this game is very light and thus aims at families or non-gamers. However, it is also great to play this as a finisher for an otherwise deeper gaming night.

What? 
Guess your opponents' cards and thus get them (the opponents) out of play. Last man standing gets a victory point. Whoever is the first to have a predetermined amount of victory points wins the game.

Fun
As a two-player game, this is really rather bland. However, four players of the right kind make this really hilarious. 

Quality of components
High. The art is outstanding, the cards themselves are made out of heavy card stock and seem very robust.

Altogether, I rate this 7.5, because, while light, this game doesn't overstay its welcome and produces laughs while playing.

The princess is upset.  Players are suitors, trying to get the palace staff to deliver your consoling love letter to the princess.  Quirky Japanese game, played with a deck of sixteen cards.  Each card is numbered between 1 (Guard) and 8 (Princess).  There are multiple copies of several cards.  One card is dealt out of the round, face down, and one card is dealt to each player - this is their hand.  On their turn, the player draws a card, adds it to their hand, then discards one of their two cards.  The discarded card must be actioned.  Each card's action interacts with the other players in some way - the Guard's action names another player and a character, knocking that player out of the round if they deduce the character correctly.  To win a round, you have to be the last one standing, or hold the highest value card when the round ends.  To win the game, you have to win a pre-determined number of rounds.  Totally insane, more bluff and luck than tactical, but works very well as a ten minute filler.  Better with 3 or 4, but still fun with 2 players.  Great stocking stuffer for Xmas.

Having now played several games of the Japanese version, I think the Japanese rules are better and make for a more interesting game.

I am not a fan of card games but seeing so many positive reviews on this one it made me wonder. I did not regret for acquiring this small card game. It can be played with up to 4 players and the whole deck consists of 16 cards!! Each card has special abilities and poses restriction to others. After a few hands everyone knows by heart all cards and the game becomes something of a poker game. Is you adversary bluffing or is he going for the long shot (give his intimate letter to the princess?) There is a 50% chance that he holds that specific card or has it the guy next to me? Very fun and ingenious small game.

In a general sense, a game that I believe is almost perfect.  There are longer, better, prettier, more strategic and more fun games to play.  But for the price, difficulty level, portability and accessibility you will never have more fun with a game.  This is one of the easiest games to play.  To newcomers, the instructions are as simple as "Draw a card, Play a card, Do what the card says."  The strategy gets deeper (not too much more), but the real fun comes in trying to read the other players and the mind games involved both externally and internally which give the game so much replayability.  This game includes just a small deck of cards and a few tokens, as well as a nice velveteen satchel if you buy the right version, and with so few components it can be played almost anywhere.  Play a few rounds between bigger games to cool down or involve more people.  Play a few rounds while you are waiting for your sushi to arrive at a restaurant.  Play a few rounds with your six year old daughter instead of an hour and a half of trouble.  This game has universal appeal and such elegant gameplay that I have to include it in my top 10.

Very quick and clever little Japanese filler that might only take 10 minutes to play, using a deck of 16 cards.   That’s a pretty constrained design space!   You are trying to be the last player left with a card in hand, and the higher the better....or the last person left in the hand.  It boils down to bluffing, deduction and card-counting, which at this scale, works really well.   Pleasantly surprised.

This simple game consisting of 16 cards is surprisingly fun and interesting. Great  game to throw in your bag/backpack and play with friends out camping, at dinner, or just to kill time. On your turn you simply draw a card and discard a card. The card you discard is the action you get to do. Last man standing wins! Who's who? Why did they play that? Did the Princess say that she liked me?... Here, can you give this to her? Haven't played?, go pick it up! It's only $10 and has many different iterations/themes. It is definitely worth the $10.

Every time I play I can never decide if I like the game or not. I have fun...Sort of. I feel like I'm playing a game...Sort of. It feels a bit like college when a group of us would play Spades and Gin all the time. It because a way to pass the time and having played so often the game played itself because the best moves (the moves to minimize risk and luck in other words) were second nature. So I play Love Letter in that mindset in that I'm not really thinking about the game. I won't get rid of it, but I also don't celebrate it.

I'm still surprised when I come across non-gamers who've never heard of this tiny hit, when you'd be hard-pressed to find a game who hasn't. A must for most collections, Love Letter is a simple, quick and fun game, consisting only of a small deck of cards.

While not particularly deep or mentally stimulating, the gameplay is quick enough to keep you involved, and the deducing a wise decision is still fun. While a very random game, full of wild guesses and nonsense, it's appealing nature and easy of transport make it a must for most collections.

Light and accessible. Great to play with non-gamers and better with people who have full knowledge of the card interactions and can offer bluffs.

I’ve been bringing out this game for years as an opener during game meets and it always goes over so well.  Holding up so well, for so long, year after year, it is a classic and perfect for non-gamers to have a good time sitting right alongside seasoned veteran gamers.  It is so easy for non-gamers to pick up the rules quickly and everyone really has a good time.  With only sixteen cards and only eight types of characters, it is streamlined well balanced, and a work of genius.   
The only possible caveat with the game is you really do need EXACTLY four people to play it well.  Playing with three people is not as good, and it really isn’t possible with two people despite what the rules say.

In first play(s) game is about card combination patterns and some blind guesses to eliminate someone.
Then, for more experienced players deduction comes in. 
And after that there is time for bluff.
(Of course still with some luck factor, since we draw random card each turn.)

All of that in quick and simple to explain gameplay.
Somehow also with a lot of laughs.

Amazingly fun card game which is ingenious in its simplicity. It has only 16 cards but the game is rarely the same. 
Whoever has a card closest to a princess at the end of the game or, more commonly, who eliminates other competitors has won the round and, possibly, the heart of the princess.
Kanai designed truly remarkable, fast card game with a cute theme.

This was a huge surprise for me. It's engaging despite its simplicity of design, and plays fast enough to feel light and energetic.

The card art is charming, although I wish the block tokens had been something else (hearts, miniature letters, etc).

Deduction and elimination with a tiny deck of characters. Much more fun than I would expect from this type of game, which I am usually not very interested in.

This is another card game (like Coup) where you have a very small amount of cards used to a really quick game.  The premise is simple: Each player has a card in their hand. At the start of your turn you draw a card, hope you're not immediately eliminated and then choose one of your two cards to discard if you haven't been eliminated.  The card you discard activates it's ability.  You keep doing this until all but one player is eliminated or the last card is taken from the deck.  If the deck runs out, the player with the highest valued card is the winner.  It's an ok filler.

RATING: 5
A simplistic social deduction / card counting game played with only 16 cards.  There's not always that much you can do on your turn due to your small hand of 2 cards, and so if you want to card count and outguess which card your opponents have, this is for you. 

2 player doesn't work that well and I thought this was more of a conceptual game mechanic than an actual 'game'.  OK, it's fun, but wears out its welcome at the end, after several rounds of guessing and counting, so I'm not sure how much replayability this would have in the long run - especially as opponents' play styles become known and patternistic.  Probably won't hold the attention of the so-called 'serious gamer' beyond 1 or 2 initial games and seemingly milked to death by designer for all sorts of inane re-themes.

Gives you the biggest bang for volume. This alone is why I'm giving it a 10/10.

Tiny pocket filled with a few cards and a few tokens, but enough suspense to ruin friendships. Very high replay-ability.

Funny story - my sister was introduced to a guy (not by me) who came over to meet us at a cafe, and I suggested that we play this game. He was anal about following every single rule, and won the game. Super smug about it, then left right after. Right after he left, sister said: "Wait, how did he win? What about *this* rule?". He was such a stickler for rules that we knew it wasn't an accident. We still laugh about it every time we bring this game out.

[3 plays] This game is so simple and minimal you'd think it would be really easy to pick up and get into. It's probably very easy to learn if you're all learning together, but it can be more difficult than you'd think to jump in with experienced players. Because there's so little to the game (not meant as an insult), after playing a bit you know all the cards inside out, and can easily card-count and make swift deductions based on what people do. So for the new player, while you're still at the level of sitting there looking at the player aid trying to figure out what the card you just drew does, it's like stuff is moving lightning fast at a higher level. 
This also seems like a shorter game than it really is. That's true of most games that use this sort of "first to win X rounds wins the game" scoring; there's a big difference in how long it takes if one person wins X in a row, vs. if every player gets to X-1 first. And number of players also makes a difference. So each round of the game remains quick, but the game itself can take longer than you'd think.

In the wake of the queen's arrest, all the eligible young men of Tempest (and many not so young) seek to woo Princess Aneette. Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, and everyone must rely on those within the palace to bring their romantic letters to her. Will yours reached her first? Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck, for 2-4 players. Get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while keeping other players' letters away. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long and your letter may be tossed in the fire! Japanese game designer Seiji Kanai features only 16 cards but hours of fun!

RATING: 7
This game is better with 4 players than 2 players.  With 2 players it is a lot of luck.  When 4 players are involved, there is much more logic and bluffing involved since the action cards only target one other opponent.

There's definitely more strategy and card counting involved with 4 players.  But you have fewer turns so you need to make the most out of your turn to deduce as much as you can.  Sometimes you can't learn anything about other players on your turn.

It's OK. I prefer the Lost Legacy "Vorpal Sword" deck. Many of the cards there have the same or similar abilities but I like the added runes element and the end of round deduction. It adds just a little more meat to a game that can seem too dependent on luck. One of my primary gaming partners now refuses to play games like this, where you can be eliminated by luck before you've even had a chance to play. I don't have a problem with that though, since it's a 5-10 minute game.

One of the more popular games of the recent micro-game trend, and one I prefer to Coup. I get tired of the lying and bluffing required in Coup and prefer the deduction and action selection of LL. 

That said, I much prefer the Lost Legacy branch for a more ridiculously fun take on things.

Love Letter is a nice light game with an equal balance of strategy, luck and deduction; for 16 cards this game can become quite engrossing!

The rules are simple, short and very clear, any clarification needed is covered in the rules so is no confusion.

The only, truly bad thing I can say about this game is that it is possible to be knocked out of a round before a player has their turn; if this happens a few turns sequentially it can become a little frustrating.

Given the very social and light-hearted nature of the game it makes me wish the game supported up to 5 or 6 players.

Love Letter is solid, light game with enough different flavoured versions to appeal to both for gamers and non-gamers alike.

A mandatory gateway game in my opinion.

RATING: 1
No recorded plays here, but I have played in the past.

Obnoxious game that claims to be a social deduction game, but has the least in any such game I've ever seen.  I would rather play Win, Lose, or Banana than this.  I would rather play Coin Age.  I would rather play the first hand of Race for the Galaxy.  I would literally play almost anything other than this non-game of bullshit statistics.

EDIT: I finally won. I take everything back. This game is the best.

Azt kell mondjam, ez egy rettenetesen élvezetes játék! Sokszor olvastam már, de el igazán nem hittem, hogy ennyi lapból egy izgalmas, élvezetes parti/családi játékot lehet összehozni. De, lehet! Vicces, feszült, egyszerű. Gonosz kis játék, de a családbarát jellege megmarad, mert ha ki is esik valaki, néhány perc múlva következik az újabb kör. Gyorsnak azért nem mondanám, mert bár egy kör gyorsan lemegy, de az összegyűjtendő kegyjelzők miatt, azért el tud húzódni egy játék. Mondjuk ez egyáltalán nem hátrány. Az ár/érték arány egy érdekes dolog: mit is takar pontosan? A megvásárolt „anyagot”, vagy a megvásárolt élvezetfaktort? Ha az előbbit, akkor rossz ez az arány. Viszont, ha az utóbbit, akkor több mint rendben van. Ki-ki döntse el maga. Számomra az élvezeti faktor megvan, az anyagminőség viszont hagy kívánnivalót maga után. Sőt! Egyenesen botrányos a minősége! Harmadik (!!!) játékunk után elkezdett leválni a kártyák hátlapja. Kártyavédő vásárlása szükséges a játékkal együtt! Amennyiben az anyagiaktól eltekintünk, akkor egy kötelező vételű társasról beszélünk!

To hear the hype, you'd think this was the next best thing since Settlers of Catan first came out. It really isn't THAT awesome of a game in the overall scheme of things. However, it is, indeed, a really good filler for a really good price and it doesn't take up hardly any room. So it's a keeper.

A charming little card game. The small number of cards belies its intricacy, which involves a good amount of card counting and educated guessing.

So, it's a game where you have one card.  Actually, it's draw one to make two and choose one to play on your turn.  This is a deduction/elimination game that was bought out of interest and which plays very well as a little filler.  Playing time is a bit suspect - I'd be tempted to say 10 minutes per player.

Love Letter is my current (12/2/16) favorite quick style card game.  It's fast, it requires a bit of luck, strategy and patience.  The "story" the game gives you is boring and does not do this title justice, as the game is quick and exciting.  The description make it look like an erotic novel with letters being passed around.

Players keep a card in hand, and then draw a card from the middle.  They must then discard/play one of their two cards in hands before the action moves to the next player.  These cards have actions that affect the other players in different ways.   

Short and sweet, pick this game up in any of its other flavors if you're not crazy about the art.  Or just grab it and enjoy a very fun quick style game that anyone should find fun.

This is a very simple, tight card game. It's a great "filler" game because you can finish a hand in just a couple of minutes, and a game in perhaps 20-30 minutes.

It's amazing how much of a game you can create from a set of just 16 cards - 5 of which are identical to each other.  There may not be a ton of real decisions to make, but it's a cute, quick bluffing game that's perfect for pulling out in places where you have a few minutes and not much room. The decision each turn is just which of two cards you hold in your hand to play - but there's enough variety in what the cards do to keep things interesting. I'm very glad to have a copy in my collection.

One hand in, the children knew what they were doing, 2 hands in they were trying to screw each other.

What a nice, elegant filler, and great fun.

You just want to play more, as it's so quick to play.

The children did find it frustrating when you draw a "suicide duo", 2 cards that force you to kill yourself, but the fact that they would be back in the next hand in 2-3 minutes and it was all part of a bigger game, meant it worked!

A very enjoyable filler.  My only gripe would be the player elimination each round.  If you have a game where it happens a lot to you, you end up not really playing much and spending most of the game watching others play.

The rounds (and the game) are short though, so this isn't a significant issue.

Unexpectedly interesting. At first it felt over-rated and like its popularity depended entirely on a tactic or two, but after a few games where we continually found new puzzling situations popping up I changed my tune. Really nice filler. It has a light deductive element that stays fresh.

It okay. It gets cool points for being small and effective but the actually game here is meh.

As a quick light filler its not bad. I played this at 2p. At 2p the choices were obvious and of the 12 rounds played 4 rounds ended with out the other player taking a turn,  2 rounds ended by lucky guesses, 4 rounds ended with some back and forth and 2 rounds came down to the wire and were fun. So half the rounds where interesting half the rounds were just lame. 

I think the sweet spot may be at 3 or 4 players..

Edit: This game stinks. But it still gets played :(

A great, entertaining, quick filler. The rules can be explain in a sentence and everything else you need is printed on the sixteen cards that make up the game. Only for 2-4 players though, would be nice if it strectched to a couple more.

It packs away to next to nothing so has always been a game that I would pack 'just in case',even taking it in my pocket to the pub.

Never I had so much fun for an equivalent of 6 USD, and the game, even if not a proper party game due to players limitations, but when 3-4 people have nothing to do or no idea what to play, quick few rounds of Love Letter can be just about what you need.

It's fast, deceptive, clever and fun, even if the theme is pretty much slapped on.

16 kártyalapból egy nagyon érdekes játékot sikerült létrehozni, amiért nagy elismerés jár. Nagyon gyors, ám mégis fordulatos élvezetes játék. Ha kevés az időtök egy társasra, de szeretnétek játszani valamit, vagy két játék között várni kell valakire kicsit, akkor nyugodtan elő lehet kapni.

Lejátszottunk egy teljen 4 személyes partyt. Nagyon jól működött a játék, szerintem nagyon szórakoztató, és pont megfelelő arányban agyalós/mulatós. Kicsit hosszabbra húzódott, mint számítottunk rá, mert nagyon kiegyenlített lett a küzdelem.

6/23/2015-The thing I like about this one is that it has so much replay ability for only 16 cards.
The reason I could not give it a nine is that it is so short but that is why it is my favorite filler game.
I could bearly believe how good it was when I first played it.dc

Overall Loot letter isn't as good as its Tempest-verse cousin simply due to its theme being off, with things like "a potted plant" and "dread gazebo" instead of the elegant princesses and counts, Still,  its entirely passable game. The cheeky bonus munchkin card is a plus though!

I have to say that I really do not like this game.  I forced my husband and children to play it with me just to see if I was missing some fantastic aspect of the game.   But no,  as far as my family is concerned, this game is just random and dull with very few choices to take.  It seem like there is very little going on until the last 2 or 3 cards, and by then which card a player has is quite easy to guess.  With just two cards to choose from each turn, it feels like the game almost plays you.   The first few turns are just a shot in the dark, usually, with a guard card.  If the player is lucky enough to guess correctly, the other player is out without even getting to play!  Then there is the handmaid  card which  just feels like a skipped turn.   I must say that I actually owned the Hobbit version, but, I do not want to turn anyone off that version if they like the Love Letter game in general.  I really just to not like the general game play of Love Letter  no matter what the theme.   For hidden role games I would rather play and would recommend Bang the Dice Game,  Lost Temple, or Mission Red Planet.

When I played Love Letter for the first time I thought it was pure genius. The second time it started to feel samey... I appreciate that the game is an attempt at a design that works well with minimal ressources but that comes with some inherent disadvantages. 

Mainly there is only a very limited amount of situations and decisions to be made so you can very quickly get to the point where you can play on autopilot.

If you haven't played this you should probably give it a try. But don't buy.

I found the game to be generally enjoyable. Still, it is a bit too random for me. We've played quite a few 4-player games, and although I have won significantly more often than not, I still didn't feel as if I had a better understanding of the game than the others. (It was more like a statistical anomaly.)

Nevertheless, we had a good time. The game was serious enough for us to pay attention to it. But it wasn't too serous for anybody to get frustrated by losing.

Some cute bluffing and induction exists in this simple ruleset and can hardly outstay its welcome. AEG's insistence that multiple games be played in a row to determine the winner is bothersome, even if the Countess is a marked improvement over the Japanese version's Wizard.

Unfortunately, a short perusal of the game's limited set of cards shows how restrained any sort of strategy is. Most available hands necessarily pigeonhole players into particular decisions. The game is so short and so brainless as to be a purely pointless pastime.

I was bummed to learn that, despite what the AEG website says, does not use the English rules from the Tempest edition with the Japanese art.  Instead, it is the exact japanese edition, translated. 

The japanese rules are different for #7.  In the AEG Tempest edition, you simply have to play #7 if you have the Prince or King in your hand. In the original Japanese rules, if your card total equals 12 or more, you lose. This means that simply drawing a card, even on your first turn, can cause you to lose the game. 

The Tempest rule is far superior, because you can use some strategy in playing #7 to bluff that you have the 5 or 6 in your hand. Meanwhile, the Japanese rules make holding onto the 5, 6, or 8 a death sentence. There's no hedging your bets on whether or not to hold onto a high card or to play it, because if you hold onto it there's a good chance you'll draw a card and lose, and there's nothing you can do about it.

Still, it's a fun game, but the Tempest rules are better.

I don't mind Love Letter, however since playing Lost Legacy, I prefer that by a large margin. Love Letter plays quickly and easily, however it seems considerably more luck-based than Lost Legacy, leading to some relatively unpleasant situations where you get eliminated on the very first turn of the game to a lucky Guard guess and then proceed to sit around and be bored waiting for the others to finish up. Thankfully this is never too long, but it's still unfun to be eliminated before you've even had your first turn of the game.

RATING: 7.5
I like how light this game is and how easy to teach.  Not much here in terms of depth and mastery though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8

It's a game of only sixteen cards, but has a surprisingly amount of depth. The cards, while having a only one actual ability, can be played for varying strategies. 

Love Letter is a bit luck based and early elimination can be a bit annoying, but the quicker pace of the rounds make up for it.

RATING: 4
I love it for its stupidity and simplicity, but I am done done done with it because it does not have enough "game" for me. Simple doesn't have to equal lucky or lacking control/decisions. I will totally play this for a laugh, but will shake my head in frustration. While doing so.

My original rating for this game was a 4, but I've since moved it up. I can see the appeal, and it's really just a harmless little filler.  I think the more I play it, I might be kinder towards it, much like my feelings for Citadel (which I, at one point, hated with the heat of a thousand burning stars).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Light fun, but got real old for me real fast. It's a filler, yes, but... even for a filler it feels like it goes by too quickly, or that the decisions you make are too inconsequential. More importantly, it has a very narrow effective player range, and this game just doesn't see the table enough for a filler.

Update: Sold it, since I'll always reach for something else.

[b][i]Love Letter[/i][/b] should not be this fun. It's only 16 cards. A long game is 15 minutes. It feels sort of like you're playing paper-rock-scissors. These are the qualities of a bad game, right? And yet, unlike paper-rock-scissors, you have just enough information to have a guess about what your opponents might be planning. Sure, you're not playing a complicated game, and sure, some games you'll throw rock when you should have thrown scissors even though there was no way you could have known; c'est la vie. But other times you'll double-bluff your opponent to a rousing victory. All of this in 16 cards and 15 minutes? It might be the most fun per cubic meter second in existence.

RATING: 10
This is 3 player gold right here. This is everything you could expect a $10 game with 16 cards to be. It's truly a gem. It plays super fast once everyone is on board, there's constant action. There is a chance you can get eliminated, but you're only out for the round which is 2 minutes tops, and it is just as interesting to watch it play out. REALLY shines with 3, with 4 it's still good/playable. Gets especially bluff-y when playing with more seasoned players. Always begs for another game once you get started. I have no hesitation giving this a perfect 10, and that's something I don't do lightly.

This a game people pay money for? The decision space is just slightly above zero.

Playing Rock, Scissors, Paper or the Chinese hand game 15-20 is faster and far more enjoyable. Staring contests, Liar's Poker with dollar bills... all have more skill and enjoyment. Seriously.

PS: It's a grave insult to Citadels to even mention this "game" in the same sentence.

Excelleny quick play, rules lite (there are only 16 cards) card game. Cards represent characters at the Palace - each charcter has and ability and a rank. Each player has just one card representing their character. Each turn a player draws one card and then must play one of his 2 cards and complete the ability of that played card in an effort to eliminate the other players , or finish the round with the highest ranked card in hand. 

Simple, great components and good fun for all.

Not a whole lot of game mechanica here. Heck, this could probably be easily played with a simple deck of cards too.

Easily the best filler I own. Newbies and experienced gamers seem to like this one. It's really all about counting, but the unused card per round makes that an inexact science. There's just enough mystery and guessing to make this one surprising and replayable. Yawn at people calling Euros elegant. This is an elegant little card game. While poor bluffers can unintentionally divulge info, I can't think of any flaws in this game itself. I wouldn't change a thing.

It's kind of the worst version of Love Letter because it doesn't have any unique rules or does anything fun with the theme. It would have been so easy to just have "the bride or closest equivalent is the start player" to at least do something with the reskin.

4 bucks from work, I couldn't argue.
Now I know why there's such odd licensed versions of this - any theme could be used here.

It's a simple game and quick, which is good for my kids.

A solid 'Meh.' Good for learning greater-than and less-than for kids. My kids quickly grew tired of this and so it was handed off to some one younger.

Again, another one of those games that I just don't understand the hype around. It's a bunch of cards, draw one, play it. Highest wins the round. Repeat.
I'm not sure why this has such a high rating.

This game is amazing! I love the idea of it! Its always hilarious when you get someone eliminated. Alot of deduction/guessing to outplay your opponent. 

My two faults with this which are not that major are one: sometimes a lucky guess eliminated me right off the back. This isn't a huge problem because there are multiple rounds so you'll get to play pretty soon once again. 

two: its best with 4 players, more specifically, don't play this without 4 players. Which is easy for some people, but harder for others.

Playing it 2p isn't all that great.  We played 4p once and it was better.  Neat little game.  :)

Really go back in fourth on this one. It's not as great as some people make it out to be, which is probably why I have had it ranked so low in the past (expectation did not meet reality kind of thing), but you can def have fun with it. Have to be in the right mood, but generally there are other fillers I'd prefer. Wouldn't buy, but I made my own copy.

One of the best filler/party games ever played. Actually it is a very compact, small deduction game, a little bit outguessing and some luck, when drawing cards, but all that is very well balanced.

RATING: 7
The most popular re-themed game of 2013. 
A brilliant study in simplicity. The game contains only 16 cards.  Each card depicts a person in the royal court, some of whom may have more influence with the princess and might be willing to slip her your particular letter of chaste flirtation, which she will read tonight by the fire. 
You want it to be your letter, right? Not the player to your left or right, or that smug bastard sitting across from you. None of them deserve her hand, and if you have to use your connections to see to it that their letter ends up IN the fire, then so be it. All's fair in love and war.

It takes a few plays to realize there is one basic strategy to this game, but before you get there, you will marvel at how well this works, and how fun it can be. It's a great way to introduce new players to a new generation of card games, and it never fails to please. Plus, it's usually priced below ten bucks, so it's an easy purchase.
If I have a critisism, then it's about that one basic strategy. Once you unlock that little gem, the game loses some of it's bite. But I won't reveal that here. 
Also, strictly from a design standpoint, the game almost looks like it should be sitting on your daughter's dressing table next to her Bella Sara cards and pink sunglasses. 
Don't be put off by it's "girly" texture.
I re-themed this game with crassly animated Venture Brothers and Pirate motifs and they fit perfectly.
There you go.

Before playing I wouldn't have believed that only 16 cards can make a fun game. But yes, it can. It's designed as a filler and that job is very well done. The deduction element creates table talk which is an important part of the fun. Sadly in can only played up to 4 players (German Edition).

This is quite frankly one of the best designed games to ever hit my table. I tend to hate the overuse of the word "elegant" in terms of game design, but this one truly is elegant. It strikes just the right balance between luck and strategy, even employing some level of meta-strategy. (It's not just what cards you play but how you, as the player, play them and react to them.) 16 cards can, and do, make for hours of enjoyment.

The proverbial big game in a small box! A superb filler. For less than £8, every gamer should own this. It plays well with 2-4 people, and, while luck dependent, has a good deal of bluff, second-guessing and tactics. Topped off with very nice presentation, and a refreshingly original theme (even if it's odd, not to say disturbing, that the townspeople's response to the Princess' mother being arrested for High Treason is to try to make her feel better by sending her love letters).

This is one of the most fun titles I've ever played.

It moves quickly, and is great for 2-4 players in about 30 minutes.

RATING: 3
The theme is:

- sexist
- boring
- completely unintegrated with gameplay.

Yuck!

A minimalist deduction game could be fun, but this is surprisingly inelegant for its size. Some draws can doom you through no fault of your own; the first few plays of each hand are random; the varying card counts are clunky.

I'm sure some of my comments are novice misconceptions, but life's too short to play games that are neither fun nor intriguing the first time around.

Oh, right, and it relies on people not accidentally cheating when they draw the Countess.

Also, the "first to 4" scoring means that game length can vary wildly, and is usually longer than the person who's super-excited about playing remembers. [Update: I was told the Japanese edition is just one short round, and it was AEG who declared that you had to play until someone wins four times. I suspect I'd like this a lot more if I'd been introduced to it as a game you play for 4 minutes. Probably still wouldn't love it.]

RATING: 7
Fast, simple, and portable. Lacks depth sometimes, but the speed of the game puts you in enough different situations to keep you thinking. 

Lately I'm finding I'd rather play Sushi Go or Coup. Bluffing in Coup keeps it more interesting for longer sessions. Even if I enjoy the fast pace, Sushi Go is faster and more outright fun for me.

These issues are somewhat remedied by the added roles and variety in the premium version.

We were surprised and shocked at how awesome this game is!

A really strong filler game - a lot more fun than I expected honestly, as the original theme doesn't really appeal to me at all (I do really love the santa theme of Letters to Santa). It's very tactical and fast paced. The only problem is  I wish there were a few more cards so that each round could last a little bit longer, and so that the odds of getting stuck with the Princess/Santa at the very start of the round weren't quite so high.

"Love Letter" is simply one of the most brilliant pieces of game design I've seen for the last few years.  16 cards, no more, no less.  A rule set which fits on less than half a sheet of paper.  And tons of fun.  Technically its just a simple game of guessing, bluffing and deduction.  I've played it with a number of various groups during the last weeks and it was an instant hit in each of these groups.  I hope that this game will hit the German market soon.

This cute little pocket-sized game is just too precious not to own.  It's a very light deduction game that is easy and quick to play, but still presents players with a enough meaningful choices to make the game interesting.  Did I mention that this game was cute?  

It's not brilliant, but games like these are good to have in a collection.  It can be nice way to start a game night, or something to bring out when you are entertaining non-gamers.  It's good on road trips or as a way to kill time between events at cons.  Furthermore, players who get squeamish around fantasy swords or sci-fi blasters will not find this off-putting.

I recommend you try this one the next time you and your Mother have tea.  The two of you will have such a lovely time.

This is a surprisingly fun little game.  When I say "little" I do mean little.  You wouldn't think 16 cards and a few little red squares would make a good game but they do.  Quite fun to play.

We play this a lot.

Hated it! I'm not really good at games like this. I don't really get them. It is extremely simple but I just don't get it. In the category of small games based mostly on cards it is simply the most recent one that doesn't match up to my two favourites Bohnanza and Lost Cities (not counting things like Poker - for money - and blackjack - for money - or Euchre and Hearts that I will always play if asked. The only reason I am giving it a 3 rather than a 2 is because if someone else really wanted to play it I would probably oblige even while knowing I had no hope of winning any round except for due to an incredible stroke of luck.

D.A

y mine en P&P :D

Parece sencillo, y lo es... pero al mismo tiempo tiene su miga, y da para bastante debate en el grupo de jugadores. :D

La premisa es sencilla... conseguir conservar la carta de valor mas alto en la mano, y si es la princesa mucho mejor. Conseguirlo ya es otra historia. 

Muy rejugable y un excelente filler. 

El mayor defecto? la sinopsis. te empiezan a hablar de cartas de amor a la princesa y te piensas que el juego es un pasteleo. nada mas lejos de la realidad. Es un juego de roles, con algo de blufeo y sobre todo con mucha doble y hasta triple intencion. muy recomendable para toda clase de publico. 

hay una version P&P de Star Wars que esta muy bien. la mayoria de P&Ps son bastante flojos (a pesar de que el juego se presta para ello) pero ese en concreto y alguno que otro mas, merecen el trabajo de imprimir y cortar.

Great little game. Easy to teach and just downright fun to play. I've got 12 plays in and have taught 12 different players so far and everyone has enjoyed it. It's a great filler between games, a good start to game day or end of game day game.

RATING: 7.5
What a great little game this is - with the emphasis on both great (it's quick, fun and easy to teach anyone) and little (just 16 cards!). It's very light and that doesn't suit everyone - people who need a 'proper' game to have fun, rather than just enjoying an experience, have been turned off. But otherwise I've had a great reaction to the game from gamers and non-gamers alike.

Just genius. Takes the interesting role-guessing and deduction bit from Citadels, and lets you play that for 20 minutes without all the other junk. Making each turn a binary choice is the key success of this game I think - your options are limitted so you can't get stuck in deduction paralysis, but you have to factor in available information and player behaviour to your decision so often there isn't just a clear best choice. It really is good.

RATING: 8
Love Letter is a quick and simple role selection game that is really all about bluffing with a dash of deduction. The comparisons to Citadels are really inevitable. 

The component quality is not good, as the cards tend to show wear far too easily. In a game that relies on hidden information, this is a Bad Thing. Additionally, it comes in a drawstring bag, rather than a box. This would be annoying for any game in terms of putting it on your shelf, but it is an especially stupid way to store cards. 

In many ways, as mentioned, this game plays like a stripped-down version of Citadels. No money to deal with, no buildings or bonuses to keep track of. It simply awards you points for guessing your opponents' choices correctly. This is honestly a good improvement as Citadels can drag with more players. Unfortunately, Love Letter only supports 2-4 players, which are the same player counts when Citadels it at its best. 

Ultimately, I think it's a toss-up as to which one is better. I like the ability to support higher player counts that Citadels has, but the stripped-down simplicity of Love Letter is also appealing. There is room in a collection for both, but owning one already may significantly de-prioritize picking up the other.

Fun if you accept it for what it is. Deep? No. Reasonably detailed fun in a short time? Yes. Don't get the princess in your opening hand, you won't be happy. Not fun with two but fine with three or four.

Totally replaced by Lost Legacy for me, which does everything this game does and has the same central draw-one-play-one mechanic, but has much more interesting cards and a more strategy-allowing win condition.

Kind of clever light deduction card game. It's awfully lucky though, and sometimes you can get knocked out without even getting a turn. The game counters the luck by making you play a lot of hands, which makes sense, but makes the game just a tad too long for what I get out of it. A near-miss for me, but I'd probably play it again if it was requested.

This is an engaging little card game, with a good deal of luck, and some bluffing in a very social small deck game.

It seems to play well with new gamers and old, and is a fun, fairly quick filler from Seiji Kanai, designer of Chronicle.

Like Chronicle, every card played has special powers, but since the deck is even shorter the luck factor is greater, and the hand play is very quick and to the point.

I found it a winner, but if players are at all slow in play in can outstay it's welcome fairly easily - there is not a ton of strategy here so much as a lot of fun playing the game.

Starting this at a 7, after a couple of 4-player games.

Its a good, no commitment, time killer.  However, I don't think I've ever played in a group that has played until some one won by token count.  We play until something better comes along or a player comes back from putting the kids to bed. Since a round is so short, its easy to take any length of time with pretty much no waiting or set-up.

Players are suitors full of eager genetic material trying to use various flunkies and dissolute aristocrats to deliver a note to Her Royal Uterus.  The winner of each round earns a "token of affection", a little red cube that most assuredly does not represent chlamydia or herpes.

UPDATE:  This game is about 9,000 times more fun than it has any right to be—16 cards and some cubes?  Passing notes to a princess?  [i]Really?[/i]  But the end result is a quick, light farce that really does feel like scurrying through gardens and halls, of tarrying in chambers at improper hours, all on the little cat feet of whispers and meaningful glances.

The genius of the game comes from the small set of interactions possible with the cards, making the deduction element satisfying enough for the time frame involved (read:  short & sweet).  Were it any more vexing or longer it would be a failure—but [i]Love Letter[/i] is a bonbon of precise proportions, mild and delicious.

I will not always want to play Love Letter, but I think it is a perfect game, and thus deserving of a 10. I see a lot of people write this off as very shallow with "automatic decisions," and others have chimed in, correctly, that the game is all about the metagame. My stance on metagame as a central mechanic (which is arguable, but I think it's clear that Love Letter was designed with this intent and that the metagame is absolutely necessary to bringing it from a luck-based card game to something slightly deeper) is up in the air, but I'm a fan of it here. If you're not holding the Princess you will almost never have an easy decision. Double Handmaid and the mandatory Countess plays are the only exceptions, assuming there's more than 2 people left in the round. The easiest counter-example is Baron-Guard but within a stable metagame even that decision becomes trickier. 

The first "Aha!" moment in Love Letter will likely involve the Countess. This is not difficult to notice, especially for seasoned gamers, but it is certainly counter-intuitive on the very first play of the game. When first playing Love Letter people will often hold on to the Countess, knowing it's a high card and likely to get them a victory. Eventually, when you are forced to play it and you get triple-Guarded, knocking you out of the game, you will realize that you can play the Countess automatically no matter what you have, and after enough time other players will realize they are wasting their time with repeated Guard guesses. Doing this repeatedly makes you safer when you do inevitably hold Countess-Prince/King/Princess. And in the end this is what Love Letter is about - making plays that make those "automatic decision" moments harder to read for your opponents. This is where the beauty of the game starts to shine. 

I often get badgered into playing this with 3, but if I had my way I'd never play with less than 4. Perfect amount of chaos, deduction, and control.

Kind of a luck-based game that makes you FEEL like you had to strategize though half the cards make you destroy your hand. Still, amusing enough to use as a time-filler and easy enough to understand to play with occasional gamers. I enjoy it far more than I thought I would when I first heard of it.

This game is great for what it's designed to be. We love playing it when we just have a few minutes. It's always goofy to guess exactly what's in the other person's hand! 

I can see how the game would get old somewhat quickly (since most rounds can be finished in under 10-15 minutes). But we're not tired of it, and I think (for what love letter is attempting to achieve) the game performs well.

Super light game that consists of 16 cards. They are numbered 1-8, some more than others. The goal is to not be eliminated and to have the highest numbered card when the draw pile is gone.

It is very simple to teach--you only hold one card, you draw a card, and you must discard/activate one card. It is also very portable. There isn't much to the game, but casual gamers seem to love it.

I've played with 5 people at work during lunch hour--they don't seem to mind that means less turns per hand. It is functional.

I wasn't impressed by this on first play, but it's grown on me with repetition. OK, it's more a guessing game than a deduction game as it's possible to knocked out immediately or draw the princess at the right moment for an easy victory. It's a rarity in gaming land though in being plain and simple knockabout fun. Admittedly the theme is weak and doesn't relate to the play, but if you accept this for what it is then it's a great piece of gaming minimalism.

A very minimalist bluffing game; comparisons have been made to Citadels, but with all the Citadels stuff stripped away. What's left is a very straightforward game of either trying to find out your opponents' identities or trying to hide your own, with one decision to make per turn and very quick rounds.  A nice little filler that's nearly perfected its genre. (2 plays)

Probably the best filler game for 2-4 players ever conceived.  It's quick, portable, has a nice mix of luck and tactics (including bluffing), and plays equally well for 2-4 players.  You can take it camping, play it on an airplane, play it at work... anywhere, really.  Be sure to sleeve your copy, though, because a marked card would ruin the game.  Not to mention, you'll probably wear out the cards with how often you'll find yourself playing it.

Quick to teach and fast rounds of play. Our regular group pulls it out as a filler frequently and always has fun. Even with people getting eliminated from rounds, the turn around is so quick that nobody really feels left out. I've found that people go from deducing randomly with guards to trying to figure out the numbers of cards left within a few rounds. 
Lots of groups I've played with have gone on and purchased their own copies after playing the first time with them!

Simple game, plays fantastic and very quickly.  Has the problem that you can be eliminated without even getting a turn, but the turn lasts less than 5 minutes so you are rapidly back into the game.

Probably like this more than I should but it just fits one of the groups of people I play games with so god dang perfectly. It facilitates just the right kind of table talk, has the amount of luck necessary to cushion any ego and enough skill involved to keep it interesting while not being to straining.

I wouldn't usually pick this up as a main game on a game night but then on the other hand it has often gone from being the planned warm-up game to swallowing the better part of the evening.

Then again I don't think it's a game to be overthought. You just kinda have to wan't to win more than you know that you reasonably should and to wan't your friends to lose more than chance deem that they should to have Love Letter shine.

If you have a hard time of letting go of the more reasonable way of approaching a game I'm not sure Love Letter will necessarily appeal to you. At least for me I had to switch that part of me off to have as great of a time as I've had with Love Letter.

It's random. It's short. It's ok.

It's not really my sort of game, but it does fill the role of "filler" to a T. My main problem with the game was how it initially seemed to be billed as a "deduction" game, and thus I was disappointed at how little deductive strategies played a part in the game's progression. But once I threw out those preconceptions, I was able to enjoy it for what it is. I would definitely not play it with less than three though, as the two-player version is influenced far too much by chance for my liking. I'm not sure I understand why it continues to rate so highly in certain circles.

RATING: 7
Love Letter is a fun and extremely easy to learn card game with just a little bit of thinking and deduction, making it ideal as a gateway, a filler, or something to play with the family.

The game is comprised of 20 cards, 13 cubes aaaand... that's it! Its really quite genius, because its not just impressively small, but its so novel and inventive that they managed to pack so much game into so few components.

The game itself is very simple to learn - you hold a card in your hand representing one of eight characters who can help you get your letter to the princess. On your turn you draw a second card and then decide which of the two you're going to play. The card you play may help you eliminate your opponents, but the player holding the highest ranking card at the end wins the round.

For something so simple, there's really a lot of entertainment value there. The game is quite interactive, and the various card combinations can lead to silly scenarios and some great laughs. There are a few tactical decisions, which keep you engaged, but for the most part you just go with the flow and relax.

This game works for so many situations, its really a must buy. Travel? Yes... Filler? Yes... Kids? Yes... Grandma? Yes... Boys night? Not so much... Starting a game collection and don't have much money? Yes... Having another couple over for dinner? Very YES!

All that and it costs next to nothing - you really should get this game.

Quick and easy game where up to 4 players try to win the heart of the princess by giving their love letters to different characters that have different levels of closeness to the princess. The players that ends the game with the closest character (represented by the highest number, from 1 of the guardians to the 8 of the princess) wins. The game is so fast that the idea is playing several rounds with the winner being the first to win 5 or 6 rounds.
Positive:
1. Easy to explain
2. Easy to play
3. So fast that you do not have time to get bored
4. A great game for trips
Negative:
1. There is not a lot of strategy, the combination of cards makes the rounds repetitive

RATING: 8
This game was just really FUN, and close to the perfect filler (depending on what you are looking for, of course...). It reminded me a a little of a boiled down version of Citadels with the 8 roles and how they interact.  

NO rules to learn or teach, very fast and fluid. Minimal decisions and very high on luck however so be warned. Also, our game ran at least 20 minutes since it was very close at the end not like the 5 or 10min reports I read (and we played with 4). Basically what you have is a little bluff and lots of guessing, some educated.  

We played with the new version of the rules, and in reading the old ones, I think the new version is better since it introduces more bluffing and reduces the luck of the draw a little as well.  

Best with [-]four for sure[/-] [b]five or six[/b], I could see 3 good/okay but 2 a completely different experience. Probably not something you want to overplay or might feel too samey too quick, otherwise a great occasional filler.  Talk about a great gateway game too, hook your non-gaming co-workers at lunch-time...My rating could rise slightly if it remains that fun the next 4 games.

Tidbit - If you want it a touch shorter, play to 3 points

Tidbit2 - Sleeve everything and scan a few of the original cards and add them into the mix to play up to 6 players. It will dilute the balance a little with respect to the Princess and higher cards, and be a little tougher to win but I sometimes find myself in a group of 6 non-gamers and this will be a great option I don't want to pass up and expect it to work pretty good overall. 


[u]UPDATE:[/u]  Played my Game of Thrones 6 player version today and it was a lot of fun, it worked very well and everyone enjoyed it, I think AEG missed an opportunity here for sure, the game would likely play okay with 7 or 8 (but not as good as 5/6). I think the game might be best with 5 now as just a suspicion, but there were no real issues with 6. Note I did tweak a couple of the rules/cards [See Baelish in image Gallery for one example] for theme and balance and added one extra role for good measure, and I am also using a hybrid of both AEG and Japon rules for some cards (and it works well since Japon is too harsh, and AEG is too lenient [7 card] especially for a bigger group). 

An additional rule needed when playing with 6 is "you can't be targeted by the "number 1" more than 3 times in one round", and of course play to only 2 points (I think 3 points [not 4] is better for 4 also). With 5 or 6 players and the Game of Thrones theme I'd rate it 8.5, the Theme fits SOOOO well too.

Bokkensprong Novelty Night, 20/09/2013. Met vake, Pascal VN, Sander en ik (gewonnen). Kaartspel met 16 kaarten (prinses, gravin, koning, prins, kamermeisje, baron, priester, wachter). Elk soort kaart laat bepaalde actie toe (vb: 1 speler moet zijn kaart laten zien). Je hebt 1 kaart, neemt er 1 bij, en speelt een van beide. Tracht mededingers naar liefdesbrief uit te schakelen (vb. wie prinses moet afleggen, verliest direct). Eenvoudig, kort, maar leuk.

Definitely don't get all the love. It's essentially a game of chance. It's inoffensive and quick, but there's very little playing to be done. It's a nice enough way to pass time with friends, but it seems to me  to be strictly inferior to just sitting around talking (unless you're with people you don't know well/don't care to get to know.) Though now instead of a princess, there's a version where you can court Batman, so that's something I guess.

So far I REALLY like this. We have some worries that the game will become boring, but as a two-player game I see this as an extremely tight deduction game. There is definitely some luck involved, but this is mitigated by playing over multiple rounds...

UPDATE: we introduced the kids to this and they loved it. They play against each other quite a bit and I have a feeling it will be the game they ask to play for awhile. The only problem we have is that family game night requires 5 player games and this one doesn't work very well with teams :P

UPDATE 2: the girls play this so much the cards are in pretty rough shape. Need to get some sleeves on these cards. The gitls have a lot of meta built into the game when they play now, it's pretty funny to hear them argue/laugh over certain plays.

This is a nice quick game.  You can play a round in maybe ten minutes.  There is a set of cards running from low soldiers to the high princess.  You all have a hand size of one.  Each turn you draw a card, keep one and play one.  The one you play has different effects like you might eliminate a player if you guess the card in their hand.  The highest card amongst the surviving players when the deck runs out is the winner.  So light but meaningful deductions and reading tells.

Love Letter doesn't have much depth, but it doesn't need to have that. It's a short game that can be taught quickly. It has a heavy element of luck, but smart plays to present themselves from time to time to keep things somewhat interesting.

Lots of fun. It's a tactical card game, yet it's more lively fun than some of the party games we have.

As a 2-player game it's just ok. As a 4-player game it's extraordinary.

My game group prefers this game to all other games that we normally play. (like Pandemic, Elder Sign, Innovation)

Forget the premise about a love letter. When you play the game you're not thinking about that at all. You're just thinking about how to stay in the game while you're trying to eliminate everyone else.

For a game that consists of a mere 16 cards, it packs a huge amount of strategy, luck, skill, confrontation, psychology, twists, and surprise endings. This is a truly incredible game.

[Edit: after 6 plays, increasing to a 9]

[Edit: after 30 plays I'm really getting tired of it, but each time I play I do have fun; keeping it at a 9 for now -- the game deserves it]

RATING: 7
Really fun, really light game.  There's only 16 cards in the deck with a variety of values and powers.  You want to end each round with the highest value card, but having a high-value card makes it more likely you'll be eliminated from the round.  The winner is the first player to win a certain number of rounds, based on the number of players.  Update: One thing I've noticed after a few plays is that the game is not as short as it seems like it would be.  Each round is usually pretty quick, but the game often seems to go 10 or 12 rounds, which can drag it out, especially with slow players.

The first time you see this game, you're going to think it looks kinda dumb, possibly cornball. There's a whole story about how the princess is distraught over her mother's betrayal of the kingdom, and the only way to make her feel better is by delivering love letters to her. Through the game play, you're basically figuring out who delivers your letter via points, and if you win, you've won her favor for that day, in the form of a little red block. This game is actually a lot of fun, you're basically trying to have the card with the highest point value at the end of each round. What makes it so entertaining is that while there aren't that many cards, no round is the same. There's some guesswork, some strategy and some mind gaming too. Plus, it's super portable and cheap!

This is a beautifully designed little game. I carried it with me wherever I went this summer on the off chance that someone might like to pass our shared time in a more structured way. It plays well with 2 players, but the 4 player game is where the fun can be had. After playing with 4 players, it started to stay home a bit more because the 2 player game just isn't the same.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2013)

Quick fun game. Very easy to teach. It has a healthy dose of luck, but it also has a crucial bluffing component (which I like) and it plays so quickly that I don’t mind the luck. It also has player elimination, but you are eliminated for about 2 minutes, so I don’t mind that either. It seems to pack a lot of interesting decisions with only 16 cards!

Perfect filler for 3 or 4 players. Not so sure about 2 players. 

I wanted to buy the game today and I saw that they were selling around US$40, WTF? I guess I will wait for a reprint.

I no longer want to play Love Letter. I (generally) don’t subscribe to the philosophy that a game replaces another, but when I play Love Letter, I found myself wanting to play Coup, so I’m downgrading its rating. It is a good game, but Coup is superior in every way. I’m selling my copy of the game and I will only hang onto the Kanai edition because it was a gift from a friend.

I’m very tired of the proliferation of micro games and Love Letter clones. When I play Love letter I feel like I’m wasting my precious gaming time. Love Letter is way too long for what it offers. I need meatier games. I will do my best to never play it again.

Love Letter is no longer among my favorite games of 2012.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2014)

I finally played with this edition. As Love Letter has recently fallen in my personal ratings, I’m rating it at a 6.0. A good game that I can play from time to time, still Love Letter no longer excites me. Coup is superior in every way so I almost always ply Coup instead.

I like the art of this edition, but if I have to choose, I would choose the art from the AEG edition, but I do like more the power of the countess in this edition. When I play, I think I would play this way.

Not much more to say about it, see also my comment for the AEG edition.

Very short, very neatly designed card game that plays in less than 20 minutes.

Very dependant on card draw, in that you can quickly be out of a hand through one of the other players playing one of the 'gotcha!' cards, but at this super-short play time it's not an issue.

What a little gem of a game! I can confidently say that this game has seen more plays than any of our other games. It's compact size makes it perfect to throw in your bag even if you're just nipping out for a coffee. The gameplay is simple yet clever. My partner and I have played so much that we're now reading each others body language, hesitations & expressions to make seemingly random yet correct assumptions!

Draw a card, play a card — and hope that card you played can force another player into discarding theirs (and thus going out of the game). It's really a question of logic based on lucky draws.

Well, it's certainly not the amazing hit game I thought it was going to be.  Blame the hype machine, I suppose.  That being said, there's a good amount of fun to be had here in such a small package.  I like the special powers and, even if you're knocked out early in a round, rounds are so quick, it's not that big a deal.  Add to that, I don't believe I paid much more than 7 bucks for this one and, you've got yourself a pretty decent game.  Good stuff!

Great filler length as the setup time is almost nonexcistent and you have to pay attention to what the other players are doing all the time.

A lovely (pun semi-intended) filler game with elements of deduction, bluffing and tactical decision making. The game is really simple with the downside being that the game is really random and the players often can't really control the outcome of the game. It's not uncommon for a player to get eliminated from the round before their first turn for example. Some minor annoyances aside, Love Letter is a clever little game that I really enjoy playing.

A delightful deduction filler game that created the micro game genre.  If played well, part of the game is deduction, but even a greater part of the game is psychology.  You must ask yourself, why did my opponent ask me if I had "such and such"?  Is it because that card is a threat to their card, or is it because they have that card and want to deceive me, or is it their best guess?  If you don't pause to consider the psychology of your opponent, you are missing the beauty of this little game.

Excluding situations when you're kicked out of the round before your first move just because you're not lucky... In good company it's a great fun, but with other people it can be just boring...

Kind of like the board game equivalent of Wolverine, it's the best there is at what it does. You couldn't build a game night around Love Letter, but it so perfectly fills those empty spaces between brain-burners. And its small format makes it ideal for travelling; made even better by the velvet bag (to the point that if it didn't come with one, I would have downed a bottle of Crown Royal just for the bag...)

What's more, it suits pretty well every crowd. Non gamers pick it up easily, and the apprehension of 'serious' gamers might feel at the game with the name 'Love Letter' is easily dismissed once they see how quickly and elegantly it plays.

I can't recommend this game enough. An absolutely perfect filler.

Players have one card in their hand and on their turn draw another one to play one of them and execute the effects. The winner is the player that survives and has the most valuable card in hand after the 16 cards are played. Only roll-and-move could be simpler. 
You can't get much more play value out of 3 EUR and 16 cards. Love Letter surprisingly manages to pull off a fun 15 minute game with a topic that's almost embarrasing for a true geek. Nice to see such a game when new games are routinely priced with 40-50 EUR at their release in Essen.

It's so simple.

This game is such a good opener for the group plus it's a great introduction into gaming for anyone unfamiliar.

Personally, I hate elimination downtime when there's nothing really captivating to watch afterwards (like there can be with Ultimate Werewolf, for instance), so that my biggest and really only qualm with this one.

Rating for Tempest-themed version. 

Best micro-game to date. And I curse it for causing that trend. Still, great, simple deduction game.

I *hate* the Kanai Factory version though. The art is hideous, and the slightly different roles are subtle but really taint the gameplay. Countess > Minister. The Countess' ability removes the element of losing entirely by luck with the Minister (Which is how most people with the Minster lose).

A great little game that is easily learned and has been a universal hit with everyone I've taught. I enjoy the simplicity of the decisions and the bluffing opportunity. It's too bad that AEG decided to put their own branding on top. The artwork is clearly inferior unless you care about the "tempest universe". I also prefer the original rules - playing to five cubes makes the game way too long. The way AEG treated this game reminds me of the way Mayfair treated all the early games like Settlers, E&T and Modern Art. It makes no sense at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is how the game should have been released. AEG is just as bad as Mayfair, if not worse. Why replace artwork with something that is uglier and more annoying due to its branding. At least Mayfair just ruined artwork rather than trying to sell me on the "Tempest universe". It makes me mad that I gave AEG my money twice.

Really excellent light game. Players many mini-rounds in trying to be the last man standing. For a game of just 16 cards, its quite impressive how much deductive elements it brings and the metagaming was great. The rules are a little convoluted, but I thought that was necessary for the games replayability.

All in all, probably my favorite filler game in recent years.

A game, which can be explained really quickly. Moreover, it doesn't take long to play it. Even more, it has very few cards. Nevertheless, it is also quite interesting. So it is a unique game. It includes a lot of luck, however some things can be derived. There is an element of bluffing and some 'guess what your neighbour is doing'. To sum up, it is a very good party game.

Žaidimas, kurio taisykles galima paaiškinti labai greitai. O ir trunka jis neilgai. Ir kortų turi nedaug. Tačiau nepaisant to jis pakankamai smagus. Tuo jis ir unikalus. Jame daug ką lemia sėkmė, bet kai ką galima ir išmąstyti. Yra kažkiek blefavimo ir draugų elgesio atpažinimo. Žodžiu labai geras vakarėlių žaidimas.

This game is interesting from a design point of view: "omg, look at the depth in those 14 cards!" It might be the best 14-card game that can be created (I doubt it, but it might), but in a world where we don't limit ourselves to 14 cards, it does not stand up.

Love Letter is one of the most elegant pieces of game design I've ever played, and anyone can pick up the rules in under a minute. It is a perfect warm-up game or introductory game that can lead to interest in other card-driven games later on, with Coup feeling like the most obvious next step.

A rather clever little game, where the word "little" would apply even without the disparaging connotations it doesn't entirely escape. In the end I don't think there's much game here, but more of an activity with many forced, obvious or arbitrary choices where the payoff is more revelation than calculation ("Oh, so you [i]had[/i] the Princess!"). There are obvious reasons why Love Letter does well in the BGG ranking, but as a GeekBuddy noted, being short is not enough.

RATING: 9
For a filler, this is more fun than it should be. The cards have interlocking powers that sometimes allow you to kill another player due to no fault of his/her own, but you can also enact enormous screwups and since you play until someone hits four letters, I think it's fair enough. I really like the art and theme - as one of the people I was playing with a BGG.con said, when you can get three straight guys at a table playing a game named "Love Letter," you have, in a sense, already won.

Three cheers for Japon Brand. Given the varied and engaging play of LL and Chronicle, I really hope they keep sending the odd card game over to American companies. I'm sure their games aren't uniformly excellent, but man, those two sure are.

This is probably one of the best filler games ever designed. Sometimes you can be eliminated super fast but the game is also quite fast so you don't feel left out if you get eliminated. I play with the Batman variant that you get points for eliminating people with correct guard guesses so the game doesn't drag on and finishes in a good time. I still like to play this after 2 years and it is a constant piece of my collection. Recommend it to everyone.

Played it with 2 players. Looks promising as a quick filler but needs an extra player to reach its full potential. Just waiting for a third player to be armwrestled *cough I meant cajoled* into playing it (-: then I will rate it.

There's something endearing about love letter.  With just a small deck, I'm always amazed how many weird situations can arise.  Such as being forced to trade your princess away with the general, then having the person you traded it to draw a guard and proceed to guess your card incorrectly, even though it was the card he just possessed....and then winning the round anyway despite that huge mistake.

This is a really solid game that revels in its own simplicity. I like describing it as "the game where your hand is always one card" which, while not literally true, does capture the essence, and intrigues a lot of people. 

The fact that it's quick, straightforward, and tiny makes it a situationally good game, but also something that doesn't find its way to the table all that often - it's actually so low in complexity that it often doesn't seem worth teaching to new people, especially now that we've built up a collection of deeper games that are almost as beginner-friendly. 

However, that doesn't overrule the fact that, as a game, it's really fun, and nearly perfect in design (we learned and continue to use one house rule concerning the Minister, but otherwise play it exactly as written). I like that it can vary a bit in length just by changing the threshold for winning pips, and it's a really good time filler/brain break when doing a longer session. It is also strong for a wide variety of player numbers; I think it's actually listed for 2-4, but it works okay as a 5-player game, too, and probably 6 although it would get rather short at that point. 

The theme is a bit hit-or-miss. I personally like it a lot, even if it's a little cheesy, but it's sooo peripheral to the game that sometimes it puts people off. I almost wish there was a version that simply had the card numbers without any theming at all (actually, one could adapt a couple standard decks for it, but you'd have to memorize all the abilities), as some people seem a bit reticent to play a game with this theme. On the other hand, some people are really drawn to it, so it's kind of 50/50.

For what it is this is a good little game. It is a great game for anyone new to the hobby and all players generally enjoy playing and pick the game up quickly. Personally I will not pick the game if there are other options to play but am happy to play if asked. Recommended, a good game for what it is.

Ok.  Not amazing, not bad.  Gets its own job done.  He set out to make a 15 card game for 4 players and he succeeded.  Kudos to that.  For the $10 or less price tag, a worthy success.  Can't say I'd vote for it as the winner of any competition like it's won, but 7 is a decent score from me.  So again, kudos.  Definitely worth a play to decide on your own.

It's odd that the theme would alter my enjoyment so much but I really do prefer Love Letter Batman to this original vanilla version (And I'm not even a SuperHero fan!).  I just don't care for the artwork or overall theme and the game is so simple I think it just needed a little more.  In either case I also prefer the slight rules changes included in the Batman version.

Can't think of anything negative to say about this game.  It's portable and quick to learn and to play, its simplicity belies the depth of tactical play involved.  I suppose the theme doesn't quite click for everyone - some didn't really think that the theme of trying to get a love letter to the princess meshed with actual game play - but I went and bought the Batman-themed version, and that theme made a lot more sense without any change to the game mechanics.  Weird.

This game proves how much fun only a handful cards can make. This is a good filler playing one or two sessions with new or casual gamers. However, the game loses playability after dozens of play. Probably, it will be rare to see I play this game but could happen to entertain guests with no board gaming background.

This comment is after just one play, but I think Love Letter has a lot more going for it than you would expect, considering that it's just 16 cards and some cubes in a cloth bag. While it would obviously be categorized as a filler, I think you could play the game several times in a row and not get the least bit tired of it.

As an interactive game, LL is obviously at its best with more players (we played with three, though, and still had a great time). But it's important to remember that the crucial choices in the game are not so much what card you play, but instead, which other player you play it on. But there's even more to it than that. I love the misdirection and bluffing aspects of the game, as well as the deduction. And it all comes together in a tiny, affordable little package.

The design of the cards is excellent, though I would have liked some sort of tuckbox for the cards. The game could easily get damaged in a backpack or pocket, and the velvet bag isn't going to offer much protection.

Most of all, Love Letter is a lot of fun! We thoroughly enjoyed it, and can't wait to play it again.

I’m aware of the fact that this is just a filler game, but after couple of plays only thing I noticed is that game is almost nonexistent.
Boring, dull, stupid, deduction reduced to the bare minimum (in most cases just blind guesses).
I’m sure there has to be a fun in this "let’s play some cards, don't keep track as nobody cares" type of game but honestly this is just complete waste of time even for the quick game as this one is.

One of my favorite games. There is a opinion that this game does not work with two players, but i play this with my wife all the time and works perfectly. Strategically you have to play it a bit differently, as it is unlikely that you will win by method of high card, but still an excellent game for two people. We also play by a minor house rule change of starting the game by playing "two" cards face down and "two" cards face up, improved the two player version a lot for us. Great game!

Update 05-28-2103 - Another great game I never feel like playing.  Down to a 7.

09-05-2013 - It appears I dropped this to a 6 some time ago.  I hardly care.  haha  I should play it again, just never feel like it with so many other options.

A cute all-ages filler game with low quality components.

Love Letter is great because it's quick, easy to teach, and a lot of fun. It's a great introductory game at a game night, and its portability makes it easy to take anywhere.  The game works better with 3 or more players.

RATING: 7.5
Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2–4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!

Lovely design and mechanics. Simple enough to be taught and enjoyed thoroughly by those less accustomed to board games. Kind of reminds me of Bruno Faidutti's Mascarade but without the long rounds and absolute attention to everyone's rounds to play it successfully. A winner. If it allowed a bigger group to play I'd rate it even higher. Apart from that the packaging is lovely and well thought. Thumbs way up on this one.

This is the best short card game going around.

It is also a brilliant example of how much a theme and artwork can add to a game. What is more memorable: When you look down at your cards and see two threes? Or look down at your cards and see two barons?

Many other cards games held up on BGG provide a game experience similar to conventional card games, or that can easily be recreated with conventional games. Love Letter doesn't, and is enjoyed by nearly all I've played it with.

I don't get it. Ok, it's fast. 
Here is another game even faster : roll a dice, and whoever has the highest number wins...

I had this kind of feeling. My two first games, I was out of the game before it was even my turn. Didn't do anything. At all. 

Too much luck, too fast, even for a filler. 
Should maybe give it another try.

Update:
Tried again with 2 players. Way too luck dependent. Rating unchanged.
On a side note, I was mentioning the idea of an even more stupid game by rolling dice. I am now the proud owner of "Angry dice", which basically is the exact thing I described. Can't stop progress.

I finally get to see what the fuss has all been about. The design is completely brilliant. Packing so much of a game in so few components is nothing short of revolutionary game design. My hats are off to Mr. Kanai for that. That being said there isnt all that much of a game in this tiny box. So its more like a curse and a blessing all at the same time. The game plays smoothly and well, and there are definitely interesting choices to make throughout. Ultimately though it just feels like you are almost picking stones out of a bag blindly, and whoever picks the white stone wins! With microgrames I just think I need a little bit more meat to the game to really hold my interest. I wouldn't mind playing this, especially considering its short playing time, but I don't need to own it.

I personally think there are better micro games than Love Letter.

But it plays so quick and it's such a nice game to introduce people to, that I will still happily teach it and play it.

I just guess my tastes have moved away from these simpler games and ultimately don't find them that fun to engage with anymore.

By BGG's own definitions of ratings, a 5 is what feels right for this game.

PNP version (Japan/AEG version not yet available in HK) 
This game is a buzz in Essen 12 and was sold out in 1-2 hrs?  

For me i defintely like the Japanese version better due to its unique graphics.  

The game play is quick with a dose of luck, memeory and some hand management.  A nice filler but can get boring/repetitive if we want to deliver all 4 letters.  Also the leader can eaily be picked on in a 4 player game, with ppl guessing him/her with soldier each turn.  

overall i think it is a good game for what it offers but the $12 US price tag is a bit bit ambious.

I think i will stick with my PNP version unless i found the original Jap version

Pretty good for what it is, but the limit of 4 players holds it back from being truly excellent for me.

Have essentially replaced it with Eggs and Empires, a kickstarter game based on a similar idea, but with a player limit of 8 and much better art/theme,IMO.

For Trade: In good condition, although the box is long gone.  Comes in a nice red velvety pouch.

This was another surprising drop for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm still always down to woo the Princess, but it's reached the point that Love Letter is only good with certain groups of people, and I've just accepted the fact that many people don't "get" it. There's so much depth in Love Letter than many realize, and it's definitely a game where you play the other players as much as the game itself. I prefer it two player (and the occasional house rule), but it's still solid with up to 4. Any more than that is too many though, and the number of meaningful decisions you can make drops way down.

RATING: 7
Love letter is a light game of deduction with a splash of screw your buddy. Some times it's simply hoping you make it past a somewhat random early game to get to the heart of the play where the real decisions take place. More often than not, there are smart decisions to be made for the entirety of play and you will often look back and see what you could have done "right" for the next play. Any game you can learn from tells me that the game space has room for you to grow as a player and make intelligent decisions.

Sometimes you'll get screwed, but most of the time there's tension and fun. Given the short duration and round structure, the fun is all you'll remember.

A filler that was entertaining when it was new but I quickly got bored of it and would rather just play a longer game.

Notes:

Love Letter is an extremely portable, light head-to-head card game.

There actually isn't much to say about this game, as reading my comments could take longer than it takes to teach the game or play a couple rounds. 

On the upside, this game is insanely portable, easy to teach, and does offer a decent amount of replayability for 2 up to 5 players, and works just as well with all of those numbers.

On the downside, there is a lot of luck involved, but that's what makes it fun and light, too.

Similar games in my collection: oddball Aeronauts (light, portable, card-based direct competitive 1-on-1), Court of the Medici (light, card-based, direct competition game for 2 players).

I can see why this one is so popular - really easy to learn and quick to play. I do enjoy it, but it seems to frequently suffer from a lack of meaningful decisions. (If you have or draw the Princess, you no longer have options - you must play the other card each turn or lose.) It's fun, but it'll never be one of my all-time favorites.

RATING: 8
A small, simple card game that packs a good bit of game in a small package.  There are many versions of this but all are basically the same.  There are nine card types each with a unique function.  You play until you are the only player remaining or have the highest value card.  This earns you one point.  You continue to play hands until you achieve a certain number of points based on number of players.  

This is a great family game.  Easy to learn and play.  The rules around the Countess can be forgotten, but that is the only tricky rule for a new player.  

I like this game a lot and highly recommend it.

RATING: 9
this is a great little game. It's essentially a deduction game but you also have some chances to take out our rivals. Mistakes or dumb moves provide hilarity - usually with the perpetrator having no idea what they just did. 

Examples: 

player with king & princess decides wants to play the king and discard his own hand, discards princess and kills himself! 

Player with prince and guard plays prince and swaps hands with player on left giving them their guard. Person on the left now knows what the person on their right has because they just passed it to them and have just been gifted a guard. Plays guard. Eliminates person to right!  Person to the right realises mistake - doh!

New player shows everyone their cards when priest is played! 

Etc.

Played with 2 3 and 4 and all are good but 3/4 is best.

Very tight little game, with very minimal components, and just a fun little game.  Takes about 5 minutes to play, 2 minutes to teach, and has just enough logic and deduction to make it interesting.  Cody loves it, I'm not super into it, so I won't bother getting it, but I wouldn't turn down playing it, just wouldn't do so a bunch of times in a short time period.

Bought a copy for Aunt Kim's family for '14 Christmas, since it's great interaction and really only good for 3-4 players anyway.  Bought myself a copy as well.  Both copies are the Legend of the Five Rings versions, though, in my case because I want to be different, for Aunt Kim's family so Ian maybe is a bit more interested since it's samurai and a green bag.  Also a buck less.  Didn't get for Uncle Ron's family since they would often have more than 4 anyway.

A lovely little game that first not really caught my attention when we tried it as a filler in the regular game group. It was to light for that purpose.
But when the kids found it and asked what it was about it became an absolute hit.
They have been playing it constantly for four month now and it is so inpiering to see them develop new strategies to deduce me, their friends and each other in the strive of the princess affection. 
It is a sincerely light and quick game. Very little strategi but loaded with tactics and a certain amount of luck. Though it is deep enough to serve as a gateway game to card games and so entertaining because all kids above 6 year can play it with equall chance of victory as hard core eurogamers.

Delightful card game.  Excellent gateway to introduce new players to boardgames.  I don't like/care for the art/theme/title but I love the mechanics.  Works best with 4 players, I hear it's not very fun with only 2 players and I believe it.  One more issue I have with this game is that unlike other card games it is language reliant.  I realized this when trying to teach and play it with non-native speakers, it loses its appeal as gateway game and easy to pick up and play.

RATING: 5
Quick, mostly luck-driven. Has openings for risk-taking, screwage, and a little deduction. That's impressive, given how few cards there are, but I'd rather play something else. It's silly that players can be eliminated before their first turn.

A lot of nice touches went into the production. Among them: the character/power descriptions in the rules beautifully bind the theme and mechanisms.

A couple got this for me and my wife over the holidays. We all heard how great it is and were eager to give it a shot. Right off the bat my wife got the hang of the game and got 3 cubes. We were sure she was going to win so we all ganged up on her. After that she only had one turn to play anything. She was effectively locked out of the game.

I caught up quickly to her and then people started ganging up on me. The last round saw all of us with 3 cubes and it all came down to who got lucky. My wife and I were out first and second.

The game can take way too long to play, especially if someone has analysis paralysis. There is definitely a lot of player interaction unless you get ahead. Then everyone gangs up on you and you're lucky to get to play a turn. My wife, after quickly getting 3 cubes, took one turn in 6 rounds of play.

I find Coup a much better, similar, game. There is player elimination but a game won't last long. We could have played 3 games of Coup in the time it took to play one game of Love Letter. I hope I never play this terrible game again.

yes its a fast light filler that works fine but im more likely to pass on it then play

it really only works with 4
the theme doesn't work that well (though i was initially draw to it for being a little different)
cubes to keep track of round points seems odd
replacing cubes with cards(love letters) seems like an obvious better choice

art is nice, i didn't feel the game was broken in any way so it seems polished
its just such a guessing game.  there are times where there is some deduction/bluff but was just enough for me to want more of that.

Our go-to filler.  Lucky guesses, early elimination and foregone conclusions based on card draw don't matter in this game because of the quick playtime.  And because they will just as likely happen to your opponents as to you.  Fun to deduce who might be holding what and to play the odds.

One of the best non-gamer games out there. Love Letter is a staple of the micro-game genre and should be in any library.

4-20-13-after going thru a few hands with Miles  the other day, i brought it out when visiting him today and this time we were so successful that he wanted to play a 2nd game of it as soon as we were done with the first.  it really is lots of fun.  this game reminds me of Citadels, but so streamlined and fun, without the boring or complicated bits.  :)

4-18-13-tried to play this with Casey and Miles the other day and gah!  they were not receptive and wouldn't listen at all.  so put it away until today and Miles and I played a few rounds.  i think it's fun and cute and fast, unsure what Miles thinks of it, but it's so quick i'm sure i'll be able to get him to play again soon.

Short, simple, tons of fun. Up to 4 players play against each other to be the last person left to win the heart of the princess. The kick to this game is the hand size for cards. You'll only ever have 1 card in your hand, unless it's your turn, in which you'll have two, but must play one of them.

Lightning-fast rounds keep this friendly and amusing, even when cutthroat tactics are used.  Anyone can play this and have a good time, and the fact that it's so portable (and attractively packaged!) means that it sees a ton of play.  Very luck-reliant, which suits my mood more on some days than others.

Also, I think it's best with 3-4 rather than 2 players.  That way, one player's run of ridiculous luck can be distributed somewhat evenly, instead of one person getting pathetically shut out for a long streak.

Only a 7 because of the 2-player flaw and because decisions really aren't that challenging.

7.0 - Jul 2014 - 8 Plays:  This one barely squeaks into a 7, by virtue of it short duration and portability.  It's easy enough to teach just about anyone, and there is just enough meat present to make it fun.  If I'm traveling it will almost always come with us, but at home there are many games that I would rather play.

6.0 - Jan 2015 - 9 Plays:  While I had said it barely squeaks into a 7, it's only been played once in the last 6 months.  It can still be fun, but it can also be completely infuriating.  I'm hoping to try Lost Legacy soon, which may cause Love Letter to take another ratings dive.

5.0 - Sept 2015 - 10 Plays:  My prediction came true.  We picked up a couple versions of Lost Legacy and I would never choose to play Love Letter over Lost Legacy.

Put me in the meh camp on this one.  There are two levels to this game.  You can play it as a simple guessing game for which it is not that good.  Or you can try to delve deeper into the deduction side of things which makes it more interesting, but since it is such a short game, the pay off for the amount of brain power/memory you need just doesn't add up.

I would play this again because it is quick and inoffensive, but not because I searched it out.

While I understand some people disliking this game because it feels random, I enjoy for it what it is: A simple to teach card game that you can carry in your bag.  Because of how quickly each round is, the randomness effect is irrelevant.  It’s easy to teach to both gamers and non-gamers with a small footprint on the table.  

If you are looking for a “gamier” version of Love Letter, I highly recommend Lost Legacy.

RATING: 8
LL does exactly what it says on the tin: Packs a good amount of light strategy and tactics into a very tiny, fast-playing package. I'm surprised at the amount of depth it squeezes into and out of just 16 cards, and that depth is just right for a game that takes 10-15 minutes.

Even getting knocked out after my first turn twice, I still had fun. Unlike most games with player elimination (even forgiving, "one round only" elimination, as in LL), it's fun to watch and it doesn't take long until you're back in the hunt.

---

After a second play, I bumped it to an 8. There's a delightful light quality to it that I really appreciate: No individual hand matters much, so I don't take it too seriously -- but they matter in aggregate, so I take it just seriously enough. Fun game!

Rating based on 3 and 4 players.

For a light, quick card filler I'm not sure how you can get much better than Love Letter, and everyone I've played this with has enjoyed it. There is a good amount of luck, but since rounds play so quickly it doesn't really matter--almost as soon as you're out, the next round begins. 

There are lots of rethemes of this game, but for the super light gameplay I think the fluffy original theme is the best one!

A simple game that combines ides of GoFish and B.S. where you try to end up with the highest card of 8. A round takes less than 5 minutes, and is easy to teach and play.

Platonic ideal of a filler micro-game. It is quick, portable, easy to teach. Unfortunately, it so easy to play that it can be easy to reach the burn-out point. Grade: B+

RATING: 9
Love Letter was a complete letdown as a 2 player. The baron ruins the game. With the baron removed (as one of the three face up cards), the game improves dramatically, but still not an ideal 2 player by any means. I will probably never play with this number again. There's just too many better games that I'd rather play. That said, I am looking forward to playing this with 4, where I'm sure it will excel. 

Update 9/28/13: 

As a 4 player, this game is great. It's light with a nice bite. I have to give it extra high marks for being so portable and easy to explain.

Love Letter is a very small, and quick, card game for 2-4 people.  The game is played over a varying number of rounds dependent upon the number of players.  To start, one card is secretly set aside.  Then everyone else gets one card.  From there players take turns drawing a card, then playing one of the two cards in their hand.  Each card has a special ability, and numerical value.  To win a round you have to either be the last one not eliminated, or have the highest numbered card by the end.

Love Letter packs a lot of strategy and variety into a very small game.  This makes it endlessly replayable, also highly portable.  It's an incredible design.

Cool little game that started the microgaming trend. But it's not that funny trend in my opinion - the problem is that I liked the first 2 games, next 2 were ok but by 5th game I was pretty tired already. 5 games is decent mileage from such a small, cheap game, but it's definitely not the classic people are making it out to be. I want games that are fun more than 5 games even if they're small cardgames - look at 6nimmt for example! I guess I'll take this out every now and then with people who are new to gaming and might like it, but other than that it'll stay in the closet. After 2 years of not playing, we had 20 minutes to kill in queue and happened to have paper and pen, I made my own copy on the fly, it was nice spontaneous boardgaming experience.

Detailed review:  http://manualgamer.com/love-letter-review/

In Love Letter, players are suitors seeking to win the attentions of a beautiful princess. So begins a game of deduction and bluff as players try to get their letter into the hands of the princess through various agents at the palace and to foil their opponents’ plans.

Love Letter is a really fun game that plays quickly with minimum downtime between turns.  It involves a mixture of deduction, bluffing, and luck – with plenty of excitement along the way.  Sometimes the cards will conspire against players, but such is the life of those trying to woo a princess.

The game plays differently with two players than with 3 or 4, and the combinations that work great in a two player game can be troublesome when there are more players in the mix.

While there aren’t many components in this game, there is a ton of replayability.  The rules are simple to learn but there are additional layers to the game that reveal themselves over a number of plays.  This game is excellent value given how inexpensive it is.

For quite a while, this was my favorite filler. It's fun and it's quick. Sure, it's swingy, depends on luck a lot and really allows very limited decision-making, but it's wonderful for when you just want to play something fast, without needing to overthink anything. Plus there are always epic games in which the first player plays a guard and guesses right, then the following player does the same and wins the round just like that.

Well this is a simple card counting game.  I'm usually happy to play a hand or two but playing by the book to 7 tokens is a bit much for me.

Not a flaw of the game, but all the rethemes impact my ability to keep track of what characters do what things.  The numbers are present of course, but I'm not about to remember what Archer or Adventure Time or Batman character does what off the top of my head.

It's goofy fun, that's it. Reviewers talk of bluffing, strategy, deduction. True, but it's minimal. There's only 16 cards, how much thought can there be?

Honestly talking I was sceptical about the game, but I really needed something light and portable to play on my trip. 

In the end it was a blast, with dedicated friends we played two games of Love letter, with tought rounds and close final. 
smooth and great, with several amazing mechanisms. For example, if you are in the first place, you are major target for other players, and most likely will end up dead.

However, this game balance out luck with deduction and add some great fun. Love it!

RATING: 7
The amount of strategy possibly in the game is very close to 0. If you want to use any sort of strategy or tactics in the game, you first need to memorize all the effects on the cards and the distribution of the deck. Sure that may not be super hard to do, but the amount of effort to do that is more than the strategic or tactical benefits you gain from having done it.

01/06/15 Played a four-player game that lasted 54 minutes over 11 rounds. (The box says 20 minutes.) Of that 54 minutes I sat doing nothing about 45 minutes, as I drew the Princess 8 of the 11 rounds and was always immediately knocked out. Twiddling my thumbs for 45 of 54 minutes is enough to drive most people bonkers. On top of that the game basically has no strategy to speak of. Its almost entirely luck and guessing. 
Ha, I can't even give it the comment a gaming buddy did who'd gotten conned into playing it a couple of months ago, "Its a perfectly acceptable 25% of a game." To me its about 10% of a game. I could have stood it if it had really only lasted 20 minutes. but at 54 minutes, regardless of who won it was utter tedium. I will never play this horrid little wart on the gaming hobby again.

Love Letter plays fast, can be quite fun and is very simple to learn and to play. My problem with this game is, that while fun, the different card types interact in a very specific, set manner. This means that it seems that different scenarios that can happen are quickly exhausted over a few games, leaving future plays feeling like re-plays of past games.
I'll still play it once in a while as a fast filler-game and my friends like it.

It has earned a place on my table as a go to 10-minute-or-less filler, a full-game-of-non-gamers game, in addition to my game for everyone-thinks-they-are-too-cool-for-deduction-games situations (previously held by Citadels, but with Love Letter being superior in limiting lenght of play and downtime while also negating hurt feeling by making elimination the point of each round).  I can see wearing out more than one copy of this in the future...

Outstanding light game.

We've played at least once every night for a week since we got it.

Easy to teach, easy to play, surprisingly deep, with beautiful cards, even better if you sleeve them with appropriate colors. I used Gold Dragon Shields and get lots of compliments on the cards, then on the sleeves when people realize they're sleeved.

Interesting game, played both the two-player and the three/four-player variants. Right now lean towards preferring the two-player game. Adding that third player changes the dynamics of the game, but maintains some of it's feel. With four it's the same as with three, but with the extra unknown information from that extra player.

Simple, quick, light, card game. It has most qualities I hate in games, but it works in this one because it checks other boxes. First, Only 16 card, perfect for travel and can be played on an airplane. Second, each round is only a couple minutes or less so even if you are out by luck, it is not for long and you get to play again. Third, my wife likes it and has played it with me 30 times so far while traveling or killing time somewhere.  Not my favorite game, or type of game, but fills a niche like none other I know.

RATING: 4
A fine short game, given that there is only so much you can do when each round consists of one decision to chose which card to discard, and then potentially another decision as to how to best use that card's effect.

People do seem to like it though, and it's a game that can have people laughing at misfortune (Baron with Countess only to see Princess, "wooops!" , the table laughs, the third player wins and you shuffle and play again) or the rewarding feeling of just "feeling it" and calling out the right card with the Guard card.

Ideal for just sitting down with a cup of coffee, you can talk about other stuff and have something to do for those who otherwise fidget and get restless at the idea of sitting and talking.

Game in a Nutshell: Entrust characters to carry your love letter to the princess while using other characters to intercept your opponent's.

Played as: 3,4 player

Pros: It's incredible that such a unique experience could be had in a game that only has less than 20 cards and a few cubes. In only a few minutes, this game manages to bring deduction, bluffing, interaction, and loads of grins to the table. The form factor redefines portability. Very simple game to teach. I actually dig the theme and that they've incorporated a pretty rich story into it.

Cons: It isn't particularly deep and basic strategies will probably be boiled down after not a huge number of plays. Sometimes luck will put you in between a rock and a hard spot such that it's likely anyone's game. It's kind of embarrassing to get beat by first time players. 

Other: This is one of those games that is pretty much a must own filler. You can't argue with the price, and it really does offer a unique experience for a game of this one's length.

Best Use: Keep with your wallet and cellphone to take with you everywhere.

Such a quick-playing card game. When playing with my wife recently we became slightly bored since the play was feeling...unmotivated. We were ending rounds quite early with either correct guesses from the priest or using the baron advantageously.

I was told that "everyone loves this game," which I naturally took as a challenge. And so I was mildly disappointed when someone else in our group said he didn't love it.

Denied my opportunity to be a trendsetter, I settled for applying for citizenship in the newfound nation of people who don't love Love Letter (population two).

It works well and is simple to grasp even for a dumbass such as me. But I actually won, which came as a big surprise to all of us, so clearly it's broken or something.

If you like simple deduction games with a little luck, a little educated guesswork and cruel plays which can knock you out mere moments into a hand, go for it. It's pretty quick and may entertain you for 15-30 minutes.

Please note that our growing country, flooded as it is with the infrastructure demands of supporting two very cranky citizens, will be tightening admission requirements and levying a variety of infuriating fees and taxes for the privilege of joining us. Prepare yourself. Once we get to population 10, the anal probes begin.

Easy to pick up and play, requires almost no table space, and takes up less space in your pocket than your wallet or phone. By the second round most players will understand the strategy.

The game is a very elegant design. Despite the simple mechanics and only 16 components, the decisions made are interesting. Depending on the group, the amount of bluffing will change, which changes the right strategic play.

Got this to play with non-gamer family members over Thanksgiving. The game fell flat on each of the four plays, with different people, over the course of the week. This didn't resonate with any of the 8 people I played it with. One game had a break in the middle and half of the table didn't even want get back and to finish it.

Update:
Pulled it out with the other side of the family over Christmas. One sister in law would love it as a gift. They really enjoyed it.

Right now the game is 50/50 success rate, but probably won't get pulled out much.

Update 2: I have pulled this out with different people over the past 6 months.

Final analysis: While some other games can stand on their own feet, this game is one that is heavily dependent on who you play it with. It clicks with some people and falls flat with others. Very group dependent.

23-Jan-2014: I printed out one of the rethemes of this one to give it a try.  It had so much buzz about it but I wasn't really sure if it was worth picking up a copy with my limited need for completely non-solo games.

Anyway, this is a fun, mini-deduction game made up of only sixteen cards.  Each player has a hand of one card.  On your turn, you draw one then play one of the two you have.  Most cards have something special they can do so you can deduce what the other players are holding.  Either knock everyone else out of the game or be the player with the highest "ranked" card at the end to win a round.  Win a number of rounds to become the overall winner.

It plays super quickly.  The rules are easy to grasp.  And after a round or two, you should easily be able to remember what cards are in the game and what each can do.  It's definitely not a deep or thinky game, but it's pretty fun, with a short play time that almost anyone should be able to play.

Pretty cool idea for such a small game.

(20+ plays) This game is exceptional for what it is. For costing $7 and consisting of only 16 cards (A fact that raises eyebrows to newcomers when I mention it), this game is incredibly fun. It's intense and exciting, with quick rounds so that players can get back into the action. I often find myself winning most of the rounds early on, but I often lose once the newcomers discover their strategies for playing.

16 cards, carry it on every trip. Fast rounds. Lucky draws can influence early leads, but especially with 4 players, players will deny each other the win. More skilled players will appreciate card counting and the complexity of when and how to bluff. Less skilled players will appreciate remaining close, and potentially being able "possum" their way to a win with good late game draws.

This is a very quick and easy game available in many flavors (from princesses to Batman, to many others I would imagine)... but the basic mechanic remains the same. A series of cards of different rank, each with a specific ability/liability. The last player standing OR the player with the highest card wins - so the game is suitable for card-counting competitive crazies, all the way to novices. Quick, easy, and portable.

Love Letter is super quick and straightforward. It's not the most basic of bluffing games, but it's not the most complicated either.

At the OT Board Game club, a group of students would play Love Letter almost every period, for the entirety of the period. If that's not a profound endorsement, then I don't know what is.

Sidenote: What's up with the princess? Seriously, she's, like, 8 feet tall.

I like Love Letter very much. As a friend said to me, either it is a genius game or totally mad. I think its a bit of both actually. In the games I’ve played, there have been loads of laughs.

AEG have done a great job of re-theming Love Letter into their Tempest series of games and from what I saw at Essen, it was very popular indeed and deservedly so.

Its not a serious game, but different to a lot of card games I’ve played. Its, fast and furious, surprising and down right mean. It looks great. The theme is thin but it works well enough. If you are looking for deep mechanics, and a strategic game, forget it. The mechanics are simple, you have some control over you destiny but not a lot so its pretty chaotic but I didn’t mind at all. Most of all its tremendously fun and a good laugh!

I would recommend this game without hesitation and would think that this is a great social game and great to use with non-gamers for a good time.

Very tight filler deduction game.  Extremely enjoyable for a couple of rounds but might carry on a bit long if full scoring is taken into account.  Can be chaotic if people make some lucky guesses, but does lead to some very memorable moments.  At the price point, I don't see why you wouldn't want a copy in your collection.

Not much to this game.  Decisions made are very few, strategy is quite thin.  Fantastic if you're looking for an extremely short, easy to teach, small game, but I have almost no use for it, as I do not enjoy it.  Also, even non-gamers that I've taught it to, while I'm sure they didn't dislike it, I have not heard them ever request it again, so not sure they really got much out of it.

Mikor először hallottam róla, el sem tudtam képzelni, hogyan lehet 16 lapból élvezhető és taktikus kártyajátékot összerakni. De kétségkívül sikerült egy zseniálisan egyszerű kártyajátékot megalkotni. A fillerek egyik koronázatlan királynője. Nem akar több lenni, mint ami, azt viszont elég nagy élvezeti faktorral hozza.

Sok játék után unalmassá válhat, de olyankor kell visszatenni 1-2 hónapra a polcra.

16 cards, embarrassing name, but awesome, quick, fun game. Once you can convince people to play it, I think everyone has fun, and even if someone doesn't like it, the game only takes 20 minutes. Sleeve the cards when you get them, though. They are a bit thin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good first impression. Light. Thinky. Simple. Play the players and count the cards, but know that 1 card is not in the deck, so the game doesn't become deterministic. My only gripe initially is that it feels like the sort of game I'd like to play with 5 or 6 but it only seats 4.

4 seems much more interesting than 3.

After playing a session where the winner was the first to reach 3vp (rather than 4 or 5 as stated in the AEG rules) the game is much better this way, as a quick 15-minute filler.

After further experience with the game, I like it with 3 or 4 players, but I always play where the first player to 3 points wins. It's also not too bad as a 2-player game (though there are much better ones out there.

I really like the compact size of this game.  And, there is a decent amount of strategy for such a small set of components.  It just gets a bit samey to me after a few rounds with the same people.  I generally find the latter half of a game to be a slog.  Decidedly not good with 2.  Tolerable with 3.  Best with 4.

The theme is not super kid friendly with "maidens being caught with others". I wouldn't want my kids at a young age to play this...

Alternatively, picked up Letters to Santa - much more kid friendly. 

Kids got it in their stockings for st. Nicks  feast day (dec 6). I played the two player variant twice. Once with my 5  year old daughter, she beat me 7-4. Once with my wife I beat her 7-5. It was a close game with the wider and she enjoyed how quick it felt because of the rounds. I was away at  work and they even YouTube how to play so we could play it when I got home that night! My families the best!

Nice micro-game. It seems easy but there is more in it than at first sight. There is a lot of luck involved but since rounds are finished quickly, it doesn't bother me that much. Best with 4 players, 2 players is less appealing.

Having only played this as a 2-player game so far, finally had a chance to play this as a 3-player last night. While it satisfies as a 2-player, it becomes a different creature entirely as a 3-player - less driven by moments of luck (the ol' double Baron trap, for example) and more opportunities to agonise over whether you're making the right decision. Great stuff.

Love Letter ist ein feines, kleines Kartenspiel, dass bei uns immer mal wieder auf den Tisch kommt. Besonders mit Menschen, die eher selten Brettspiele spielen, kann man Love Letter sehr gut spielen. Ziel des Spiels ist es einfach,am Ende der Runde die Karte mit dem höchsten Wert (Prinzessin) auf der Hand zu haben, oder alle anderen Mitspieler "rausgeschmissen" zu haben. Dies geschieht durch die Eigenschaften der Karten, z.B. darf man die eben erwähnte Prinzessin nicht abschmeissen, wenn man sie einmal auf der Hand hat, bestimmte Karten, wie der Prinz können einen aber dazu zwingen. Außerdem kann man rausfliegen, wenn die Gegner wissen, welche Karte man auf der Hand hält. Hier istalso ein bisschen Täuschen und Bluffen angesagt. Dabei spielen sich die Runden so schnell und flott, dass man man auch mal mehrere Runden Love Letter am Stück spielt.

Love Letter has overtaken For Sale as the best 'filler' game I own.  It's incredibly fun, simple and plays quick.  Very luck dependant but there are just enough tactical choices that make you want to play it over and over again.  Incredibly clever little card game that contains only 16 cards! A must have! 

I also own the Kanai Factory version and whilst I prefer the art work, the Countess card makes the Tempest version, in my opinion, better because it adds an element of bluffing.  However, the card quality in this version is very poor in comparison.  Even if you don't like to sleeve cards, I would strongly suggest that you do for this game.

Love Letter is the definition of a good filler- its exceedingly light and fast, has a large dollop of luck and a little twist of strategy and bluff. It can often feel like you are being played by the game rather then playing it but more sessions will reveal subtle strategies to the chaos that can be exploited by a wise player.

A game round can be over in just 5 minutes, although the AEG version I played is supposed to be played for several rounds until one player wins 4 times. I feel this may be too long for a game as simple as this, and would personally play it first to just 1 or 2 wins.

Its still a very fun little game considering its simplicity.

Amazing filler game. The design is excellent because game feels like it is requiring a lot of skill even though there is a lot luck involved. Rounds are quick and thus you never feel bad for being eliminated. 

Rules are super simple and you can probably play this even with children. With serious gamers there is a lot of strategical decisions to make to keep the game interesting for a long time.

RATING: 7.5
Big on player interaction, and plays relatively quickly once all players have familiarity with the cards.  

It can outstay its welcome with max player count playing to the full 4 point victory.  I try to keep the plays to one set per evening (although often people want more) as I want to insure we don't play it out.

From a play time perspective, we're already playing with the house's money on this purchase.  This is definitely an enjoyable game.

One of the fastest games out there, Love Letter is a quick card game where the players look to play members of the Royal Court in the hope of being the last player left in a round and thus getting their Love Letter through to the Princess, who will reward you in kind. 

Win enough rounds and you take the game. 

Love Letter is a ridiculously simple design, which feels similar to games like Palasgefluster, except that this is even more streamlined. 

Player's take turns to play a card, representing a member of the court. Each character has a single line of text such as allowing the exchange of cards or allowing a player to guess the character held by another player. 

If guessed correctly, that player is knocked out of the round. 

So Love Letter requires a little deduction and some luck in order to give yourself the best shot. 

This was originally released with a Japanese Theme and has since spawned many custom variants.

-Gets boring fast after repeated rounds

Easiest game ever?! Draw a card, play 1 of 2, do what it says, next! Even if you don't know all the cards (which is kinda required to get to the good stuff) there's a handy reference with all cards and effects. Cool game if you just want something to do that doesn't require a lot of room or brain power. However, it gets stale fast after a couple of rounds. I do appreciate its extreme simplicity though, and earns a point for that!

Fantastic micro game! I was skeptical about this game.  It seemed people were far too excited about it... but after finally picking up a copy, I can join in the excitement!  It's a great social deduction game that goes by quickly, yet has everyone working towards winning the game each round.  I played with 3 people, and it was excellent.  I think the game is perfectly small.  It has enough cards to make guessing the other characters card difficult, yet few enough cards that you can figure it out in just a few hands, often times 1 or 2 if you're lucky.  Each card is masterfully crafted with the perfect ability for game.  Nothing feels wasted or not thought out.

Again, I am amazed by Japanese designers that use very little components to bring a sufficiently deep game.

A fast filler that brings out lots of laughter.

It's strange I actually don't like the game when it is played by the rules. I have house ruled into the game a rule that, when there are only two people left, whoever is the last to draw, and there are no cards left, gets to guess who is in the love letter bag. If guessed correctly, they win, if not, the other person guesses and the point is awarded if they get it right. This is played of course, by not looking through the discard pile.

It changes the game completely and adds an element of memory to the game that keeps people really checking out for cards. Much better, and deeper in my opinion even though there is a slight luck element at the end.

After an initial rating of 9, I lowered the rating to 7 after playing the game with 2. I played twice with my wife and though the score was as close as it could be (I won both games with 7-6), i believe that the game loses half of its beauty with 2 players. Many (first) rounds ended up like: "I have the guard, do you have the princess?" or "I have the priest, I see the princess, next round I play the guard and win the round".

Still a good game though, I would gladly play any time

The golden hit of japanese micro-games. Lightning fast, super-fun and portable enough to take anywhere. Strong contender for the title of "king of filler".

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In this card game, one is attempting to woo a princess with a love letter, and you want to prevent others from doing the same. There are 16 cards, with a numeric rank from 1 to 8, and each card has special abilities. For instance, there are 5 copies of the 1 card, which is a guard, and if you guess an opponent's card correctly, they are out for the round. Each round play cards to be the last one left, and you earn a cube. Play over multiple rounds, and the first one to four cubes wins.

It's a fun little filler. Yes, there is luck, there is some deduction involved, and it plays quickly.

RATING: 9.2
This game is VERY high on luck BUT not AS high on luck as you think it is the first time you play. You start to notice and understand subtle strategies in terms of logic of what's on the table and what must be in hands. There's a also a blackjack "card counting" element as far as playing the odds of what is likely or less likely to be in other people's hands.

The art is beautiful, the velvet bag is fun and convenient, the theme is there enough for how simple it is. This game is easy to teach, easy to play, you can play to as many points as you want or as few--the amounts they say in the rule book are arbitrary but good enough.

There's just enough luck, secrecy, decision making, and even bluffing. I think you need deeper bluffing with your behavior than just what you actually play to do really well.

The game is better with 3-4 but wasn't bad with 2. It's just less likely each game will be as dynamic. Many games that are 2-X players do better with more but it's especially so with this one. 

Because there are only 16 cards and they're reshuffled so often (one con to the game is the constantly shuffling), it's best to use sleeve protectors to keep the cards lasting.

I would put this in the same level of depth as Tsuro or Cthulhu dice only this one is probably better and has a bit more strategy and skill. 

Highly recommended.

Didn't really get the love for this. It's a guessing game, right?

It's quick I guess. But boy, was I expecting something else.

UPDATE: Okay, it's cool with the right group and just as a fun kind of quick no brain game at the end of the night, so goes up a couple points, just as it does what it does nicely.

Eh, its a basic card game with too much luck of the draw for me to like alongside its player elimination. Its cheap and small, which is nice, but its also a tad shallow and boring.

I think its a travesty that this is ranked and rated so high when so many other card games do it better. Even its sequel, Lost Legacy, would be a better candidate imho.

Plays: multiple game sessions trying to reach a minimum number of points (probably 4+ sessions or so)

Perfect filler game for 3-4 people. Fast, easy and I can bring it out easy and someone will want to play. The reason I rated it at 9 is that I wished it supported more people, this game is too good not to be a party game.

Great little game.  Managed to convince people who would never play anything but traditional card games (500, Uka, hearts, etc) to play this and they liked it.  Helps that the rounds are so quick.

You do however need to sleeve the cards to stop any chance of them getting marked.  I'd also suggest getting rid of the cubes (pointy corners mark the cards) for some flat plastic tokens.

Two player variant is ok for teaching people the rules but 3-4 players is the way to go.

I got the impression that playing "first to 4 cubes" is a bit pointless because as soon as anybody got to 2 cubes they were targetted until everybody had 2 or 3 cubes. It seemed inevitable that no player will ever score less than 2 cubes, so the game could be made a lot shorter by playing "first to 2 cubes".

An amusing and clever design that packs more into 16 cards that it has any right to. That being said, 16 cards are only so fun, so it's difficult to imagine playing this repeatedly... even the requirement that the winner scores 3 points can create a game that drags with 4 players. Still, on the more tolerable side of social deduction games, since it has such tight constraints placed upon it.

Pretty good. You get the guard in the beginning a lot, so your first instinct can be kinda the same each round.

Someone with the guard can sometimes just randomly call your card and screw you over, it happened about 4 times one one game, and that sucks, but the game is quick and light, and overall there’s enough process of elimination that makes this game satisfying, but I think guildhall does what this game does, but does it significantly better.

Nice little game for the whole family.

Pros:
 - Fast setup & gameplay
 - Easy to teach
 - Nice bluffing elements and even though the game is very simple you can still strategize with the cards you play
 - EDIT: Great artwork

Cons:
 - Player elimination is bad in general but here the rounds are so fast that it doesn't bother you so much
 - Very luck driven game, all that it takes is the right cards at the right time (and half a brain...)
 - Only for 2-4 players, I would like this kind of game to be playable maybe up to 6 players at least.
 - I would not play Love Letter with only two players, haven't experienced it but the mechanics here seems to works better with more players.

RATING: 5
I appreciate the idea of making a full-fledged game out of a few cards and the nice, a little off-beat theme. In the end there are still very few decisions to be made and the overall winner is mostly decided by luck. 'Love Letter' lives from the suspense whether you will be caught with the wrong card in your hand or you can survive just long enough. Beyond that there is not much game here. Nevertheless, it can be a good choice for casual players due to the easy rules, theme, quick play and minimal space requirements.

I really like the simplicity of this game, there's a degree of luck and deduction, and whilst players can be knocked out of the round, the game is over so quick that it doesn't matter.

Having someone randomly guess the card you have is annoying and just makes you want to get them back next time.

Simple and fun.

I'm not sure why Love Letter has gotten so much acclaim because I'm not sure its possible for a actual game to be contained in just 16 cards.

With each turn giving players a maximum of 2 cards in their hands the whole game amounts to a maximum 2 thoughts per turn: "Which card do I keep?" and possibly "Who do I pick on?" Then, while everyone else has their turn, all non-active players get to contemplate the question: "Why is this game called 'Love Letter' anyway?"

The fact that no one in our gaming group ever wanted to play a full game of Love Letter must say something about it. We'd play a few rounds and then just move on to something else, something better. 

At the very least, if this game interests you, get the Limited Edition with the original Japanese artwork. The Tempest version is plain ugly.

A quite clever deduction game.  With the proper deducing you can figure what cards everyone has.  You can also be clever in your card play that will give you the chance to knock some players out of the game before the end.

There are a few cards numbered 1-7 with each one having a special power.  The game really lends itself to clever card play and deduction and it was my introduction to these shorter type card deduction games.

This is barely a game. Many times you will have a pair of cards that leaves you with no decision to make.

Two-player rounds are lightning fast and totally hysterical. Four player rounds usually seem to last until the deck runs out, and have more actual game in them, including card counting.

Includes multiple card effects that require the players to be completely honest, so you might want to choose your opponents carefully.

Neither of the 2012 versions are boxed, which is a bit inconvenient. Very good card quality in the AEG edition, except my copy came with a marked deck. The boxed 2013 Pegasus edition is quite impressive: Wooden hearts and oversized AEG cards. The 2013 Kanai edition does not look bad either.

A great game for what it is. Bluffing, deduction, pushing your luck, and shouting. Shame about the AEG release being so godawful; the original Japanese art (big fan of the original artist) and rules are much superior. Forcing players to play a set number of hands and track wins with little blocks is asinine, and against the spirit of the game. The changes to two of the cards also actively harm the gameplay.

Talk about simple, this game doesn't try for any gimmicks.  It's 16 cards, 8 types, and all you do is draw a card and play 1 of those cards.  And repeat till someone has a bunch of wins.

I usually hate simple games, but this game is so funny for some reason.  You have to play it, the game is like 8-10 bucks and you will be getting more hours out of this 15-30 minute game than your big hitters.

Giochinoinoino di carte veloce che si lascia giocare per via delle sua immediatezza e semplicità. Nel complesso non c'è molto dal punto di vista strategico, anzi proprio poco poco, la pesca delle carte governa l'esito delle partite. Filler che si spiega in 1 minuto e con partitelle che durano veramente poco. Simpatico ma forse troppo leggero! Probabilmente rende al meglio in 4 giocatori.

16-card game with surprising depth! In this game, you're trying to win the affections of the princess before somebody else has the chance to. Combines luck, strategy, deduction, and even bluffing elements in a small, streamlined package for a fun, fast-paced gaming experience. Thanks to its small size and easy rule set, this is the perfect travel game for small groups. Be aware, the game is very luck-dependent with only two players, but strategy develops quickly as you add more people to the mix.

This is almost acceptable as a filler. There isn't much to it at all, but there are a couple cool elements that begin to reveal themselves after a round or two. Can be funny, especially if you're as forgetful as I am (I saw someone's hand, then used the guard on him and totally guessed wrong... :blush:). It can also be utterly dry and boring depending on the card draw and the player base.

There is really no game here. No, it's not a bluffing game or a deception game or a memory game. It's a crappy game. Overhyped for sure.

"It would like to be, but it can't"

Love letters is a game which initially surprises everybody. With very few rules and even less cards with easy abilities you are able to build up interesting and unexpected situations, which make fun. Deciding what to play is very easy and often straightforward, game is strongly balanced thanks to the fact that it is strongly luck driven in several matches (central limit theorem effect...).
But sooner or later it will happen that you have the Princess in hand since the beginning of some consecutive games and you will start to count how many real DECISIONS are you taking. For me it was 11 decisions in 12 matches (of 4 rounds each)... wow! All the rest were either mandatory (other 36 card decisions and about 15 players to target) or totally random (says a role when all are still available). And the 11 I took were only between TWO options!
Honestly, this is the decision level of tic-tac-toe! I can easily program a computer WITHOUT AI to play in my place, buzzing for my attention whenever a real decision is going to be taken (every 5 minutes).

Game can be improved if cards are made a little more complicated or maybe 3 in hand.

In general, the mechanics of this hidden-role card game are quite clever. It isn't without its flaws, however. Certain cards are either useless or over-powered at times, so I think the role interactions could have used some tweaking. I'm not sure the game has a lot of replay value either. But for the most part, it is an enjoyable diversion that does require some tactical shredness.

Surprisingly more-ish. Not sure I'd want to play it each week, as each hand is much the same as the previous one, and you play quite a few hands, but the hands go so quick, that even a quick exit on one hand doesn't leave you out of the game for more than a minute or so. There's a decision to make with each new card, trying to work your way into a position to win the hand. There's a deduction / elimination type aspect - what cards are out, been seen, what might he have left in hand. It's like lots of little Cluedo's, one after each other, with a little risk-taking as well when you play a higher card and keep a lower card. It's a solid filler, easy to teach and play.

Great filler game, which plays quickly and is a lot of fun. Some strategy and luck is involved but I feel the correct balance of each is there. Certainly short enough for it not to matter if you are eliminated one round through no fault of your own. Bit of a hidden gem here seeing it’s an older game but I must admit I personally prefer the new art work for the characters which look great. Nice game.

- Still not clear how much skill there is.

Super clever game design. It's a nice quick filler, but I think it would wear out its welcome at about 30 minutes. I think the 1.2 weight is about right. I might go 1.4.

Great for what it is.

I mean I can see the cons. Lot's of luck involved, little strategy and you get the feeling that sometimes the game plays itself, phalocratic and girlish at the same time, but...

...somehow the game manages to be fun for me and everyone I played with. Just silly, lazy fun with a pinch of thinking (what cards are still in play, and how to manage every situation).

Super portable, super light, super quick rounds, super cheap, super easy to explain (people easily intimidated by rules and complexity will find paradise), lots of socializing. 

I personaly feel a pokerish aspect, when I learn what faces each player of my gamegroup make or tactics they use when they got certain cards, and then name the cards with a guard, without having any obvious clue and make my opponents mad. Great feeling!

Play it anywhere, with everyone, anytime. Thumbs up. 

Get it and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL8e2ujXe8g!

(Wife's Point of View: She doesn't love it, she just likes it, but it's so fast, light and comfortable that is always enjoyable for her. Unfortunatelly I belive it's a bad 2 player game)

Simple filler card game that looks more random than it is at first glance. The more cards that get discarded, the more information is left about the potential cards that the players are holding, this has the effect of speeding up the end game and increasing the skill that is involved in making decisions.

Always fun to play and somehow it always seems to end with the scores very close.

Fabulous filler game, and probably the best 4 person filler. The only reason it suffers is because when we have 4 players and need a filler game my group (minus myself) would much rather play a traditional card game such as Euchre, Oh Hell, Spades, or Hearts.

Don't bother playing with anything but 4 players.

Honestly wouldn't bother with the deluxe edition.

The incredibly-streamlined filler feels a little like the role selection of Citadels, but without all of the other stuff.  It's so light that it really feels more like an activity than a game--something to do when you're not doing something else.  I guess that's really the definition of a filler, but I'd prefer a little more gamey-ness.

Comment: Not nearly as good as the original design, the changes to this game put it down a few notches for me. It's fast, fun and mostly luck based. My biggest complaint for this game is the 4 player rules. It takes far too damn long to actually complete this if you have a player try to hit 4 wins. Sometimes it's quick, other times this turns into a 30-45 minute game. It's not fun after about 20 minutes.

Comment: The original and slightly different version than the Tempest one. I really like how the Minister plays and I really like the card left in hand when the deck runs out versus what you have in front of you. It's slightly more strategic that way and opens up a different layer of depth.

Edit: These subtle changes really mix up the game. We love this version as compared to the tempest one. Our go to game when it gets really late and we don't quite want to go to bed yet.

This game is one of the quickest games you will ever play. It takes about 2 or 3 minutes and it's over, but it is a LOT of fun. I only play this game in between two longer games as a bit of a break, it's not ideal to start a game night because every game will seem even longer after this, but it is great to break up a couple of longer and arguably better games with something like this to keep the games coming. This is a lot of fun though, very easy to learn and play and a nice micro or mini-game to have around.

A fast played game with simple rules and a fun (however minor) aspect bluffing who your character is.  Well worth the price/space to have this filler in your collection.

Sometimes the bluffing doesn't come into play and the cards play themselves.  A few card interactions can become fiddly.

BGG SS 2014.  So much fun.  We play this while brewing beer and it's great that we don't have to sit down to play.  The rounds are quick, and so is a total game.  You only have 2 cards in your hand on your particular turn, so there isn't too much strategy (until you get towards the end of the round and you're trying to count cards, guess what card is burried, and what is in the other player's hands based on what they're laying down).

Whether or not this was the first of the micro-games, it is certainly the most well-known - and in a seemingly endless stream of repackaged iterations. It is easy to learn and fun to play. And, of course, each game is very quick - esp. when, in the first turn, someone plays the Guard and arbitrarily asks 'Are you the Princess?' (and you are).

03/30/13 - I got this game to play on the go with friends at work and as a quick filler. It seems like a great game for 4 players but I think the game becomes pretty quick and random when you play 2 players. I'm rating it a 7.5 right now but I'm sure it'll change with a few more plays. (Rating: 7.5)

3/31/13 - Played a 3 player game today and bumped it up to an 8. The game was tense and full of surprises. It's amazing how such a small game can pack so much fun. (Rating: 8)

This is a really good filler to fill in the gap in between games or to play with non-gamers. My parents had a blast playing this game. 

I still think Biblios is the better filler for me simply because it is more random than Love Letter. After 3 straight games tonight it does feel a bit of same-y. I would like to try it with 4 players. I don't feel this with 3 games of Biblios. Randomness does help on the re-playability here.

This game strikes a balance between memory, deduction, and a bit of bluffing/gambling. ;) It is a solid game with a dash of luck.

I don't worry about meaningful decisions because it is so light of a game. My first game with parents did run for 45mins since they were struck with AP.

Update on 17-12-2013:
Played a game with 3 friends, it was our first game and we all found it was an easy to learn, short, interesting game. Just so few cards but gave us unexpected fun. Holding a 8-Princess does not mean you will win. In fact, I won a round by just got a 1-Guard as my last card since I can guess which card my last opponent was holding, haha. Would like to play more games in the coming Christmas.

Will try it with friends in the coming weekend.

This game is surprising good, for what it is. Very few components; it's certainly a micro game. And it plays really quick, so getting eliminated isn't a big deal. And it can accommodate larger groups; but it probably shines with 3-5 people. Obviously it's quite abstract and light on the theme.

This is a fun little card game that is perfect to take with you when going out for drinks with friends. The rules are very simple and easily picked up by even non-gamers. The only weakness of the game is that it is very dependent on the luck of the draw. There are a few card combinations that, when playing with even moderately observant opponents, almost guarantee that you will lose. That said, it's this randomness that can make matches surprising and memorable.

Maybe for the right people this works but my group, mostly hardcore euro strategy gamers, did not like this at all. We've played other quick social deduction games like Coup and enjoyed them but this just feels like way too much chance. Even though the rounds are short it still sucks to be eliminated before your turn even begins. Not much to like here for us; not sure why it has such a high rating. The only reason I don't score it lower is because I can see a tiny bit of strategy and so there is something, it's just not enough for us.

RATING: 8
This is a blast to play. There aren't that many (non-obvious) decisions, but at the same time there's plenty going on. The reading and deduction make it less quick than other light games such as No Thanks!, but there's an element of secrecy that adds tension and theme and laughs that other games this simple don't usually have.

It's a wonderful design. I just might have to carry the cards in my wallet at all times, since I'd play this game any time, anywhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After playing the game I was left wondering how could I apply deduction?

I think this aspect will only become apparent after playing the game several times, because it seems that the only way to read someones choice of play/body language is to know the deck well and the consequences of the text effects. For such a simple game the textual terrain and card tracking is a hurdle just to get to the satisfying exercise of trying to read your opponent, especially for a elimination game.

Quick Deduction/Guessing game - Be the last one alive or be holding the highest card when the deck runs out to "win" the round to earn "tokens of affection".

Świetna gra. Szybka, tłumaczysz zasady 2 minuty. Skalowalnośc też niezła. Bardzo szybka, gramy w nią na przerwach pomiędzy lekcjami i to czasami po parę rund. Praktycznie nic nie musisz pamiętać, wszystko jest napisane na kartach, są też karty pomocy. Mała, poręczna, świetna na podróże, nawet na takie większe, bo nie trzeba dużo miejsca w plecaku, jaki i do grania. Ogólnie gorąco polecam.

What a breath of fresh air! There are so many ways this game shouldn't work. It only has 16 cards, eight of them unique. It has player elimination, often before you've even played a card. It offers few choices, let alone meaningful ones. But I've already played it 25 times, and I don't think I'm ever going to get tired of teaching it to a new group (in 30 seconds) and seeing them erupt into hilarity within a minute flat. Pure joy in an envelope. 

[Brief note on versions: I prefer the art and rules of the Japon Brand original, but others favour the AEG version in one or both aspects. YMMV, but it doesn't really matter]

RATING: 5
Does not actually play well with 2, as your decisions are simply which one of 2 cards to play each turn  -- and some card plays are obvious losers or blocked by the effects of other cards, so you can actually have no decision on many turns in 2 player. This is pretty close to random draw and would get a 1 rating.

However the addition of a 3rd or 4th player adds the crucial choice of which player to apply that effect to, which makes a damn fine game with a shocking amount of emergent strategy, this probably deserves a 10 rating.

So, I'm gonna average those scores and give it a 5 overall.

This is a fun, quick filler game. Once people know what the different cards do it can go very quickly, and there are some nice bits of emergent gameplay that start to come out as people figure out the game (like bluffing by discarding the Countess). There is a fair amount of luck involved in each round, so it's best to play several round in a row like the rules suggest.

Love Letter is a really nice filler game. The strategy is fairly trivial and there is a substantial amount of luck in terms of the cards one draws. That said, games move along quickly (although I think the best thing is to decide beforehand that the winner is the person who gets 3 tokens of affection first) and is very easy to teach and learn.

For about $5 and with just 16 cards, Love Letter is a unique game and totally worth it.

Love Letter is a simple game that can be very intense, especially in later rounds. The nice thing about this game is what you can 'deduce' about other player hands, making it satisfying when you correctly call what card they have. The game feels nicely balanced, with the 'value' of cards being a nice equaliser to the abilities that they grant. The theme, while not the most prominent while playing, is pretty interesting and ties well to the different card mechanics. I would recommend playing with the full 4 people, as having less does hamper the enjoyment somewhat. Simple, clean fun.

I first played this as a quick game at the end of board game night with a friend, without either of us having played it before, and it was nicely straightforward to pick up. 

Thoughts after this first play-through: 

* I enjoyed the mechanics of the game, which I imagine allow you to play quite strategically. Certainly by the end of a couple of rounds It was fun as a 2-player, though I'd definitely be keen to play it with 3 or 4 players as well.

* The "love letter" aspect is of course fairly arbitrary, in that using the same game mechanics while changing the motivation & some of the character names would result in an essentially identical gaming experience. But consequently it doesn't really matter one way or the other; it's a framing story to hang the gameplay on rather than being absolutely essential to the game.

* Given the small size/ease of picking up the rules/relative inexpensiveness of the game, I'm definitely inclined to pick up a copy.

Really great little game. Easy to teach and quick to play. I made a custom Monster High theme version and have played this with my daughter since she was 6. She absolutely loved it and played it practically daily (so much so we have gone through 2 sets of cards and now have a set of plastic ones). Now she often asks to play the normal version. Had I started her on this though I doubt she would have ever persisted with it. I am always trying to find games that I can play with my young kids. This is the only board game I have played with any of my kids at that age that we both find equally fun. I haven't played it myself, but the "Letter's to Santa" version might be good for trying to get young kids into the hobby.

An enjoyable "draw a card, play  card" game that is light and somewhat silly. Each card type has a special power and you get to try to be Last Man Standing in your attempt to seduce the Princess by delivering a letter to her. Don't overthink it. 

The AEG rules of playing to 3 cubes can create a game that takes 30 minutes, which is crazy. Play a couple hands and call it a day. If someone wants to be crowned Ultimate Winner of Love Letter, you're playing with the wrong people.

Everyone on the internet raves endlessly about how good this game is, but I really don't see it. It feels like a reskin of Fluxx, but with significantly fewer cards. I went into it expecting something more along the lines of Coloretto, but there are hardly any decisions to be made, and those that exist are either random or obvious. It's not to the level of Candyland, for instance, but it was uncomfortably close.

Pros:
* Extremely portable
* Nothing to setup
* Plays well with 2

Cons:
* Doesn't play as well with 2 as with 3+

Variants:
* When playing with 2 people in a restaurant, use a single scoring token (e.g. a salt shaker) and place it between both players. After each round, move the token one "space" closer to the winner. When the food arrives, the winner is the person to whom the token is closest.
* When playing with 2, allow targeting of a player who played a Handmaid but ignore the effect.

We played this on the side of a hill. The game needs to little space, we were able to play by keeping the discard pile on one person's lap and the draw deck on the other's. We've played it at parks, in restaurants, on the bus. And unlike other games that might sacrifice gameplay in order to play in so little space, this one is actually FUN.

September 2017: Gave it to a friend. Downgraded from 5 to 3. There is no long-term replayability. At least it's short.

2014-05-13: Update. A 5. This game is like cigarettes. It gives your hands something to do. A bit addictive, and probably not good for your gaming health in large amounts.

The take-that is more tolerable here than in other games because often there is a risk of being nasty towards your opponent.

2013-03-27: Update, from 7 to 6. This is surprisingly not newbie-friendly. In order to enjoy this game at its full potential, an ultra-light deduction game with a hint of take-that, players have to understand how all the cards work together. Newbies don't realize this, assume that Love Letter has too much luck, and give up quickly on it.

Update, from 5 to 7.

Much, much better with 4. A lot of clever ways to deduce what you're opponents are holding.

This is a filler for gamers because the deduction elements are actually not that straightforward.

A lot of fuck you opportunities, from opponents and from the luck of the game. It's hilarious to have the game itself eliminate you from the round.

==================

Not very good at all with two -- at that number, it's a game you laugh [b]at[/b], not [b]with[/b].

There's so much luck in this game that the deduction and bluffing is not noticeable.

This game is a gateway to deduction and "bluffing" games such as Coup. It is so far the easiest setup and quickest game.

At first, it is lots of fun, but your group quickly realizes that most of it is really blind luck. It is deduction game of Go Fish with the player elimination of Coup.

Not much too this game though. There are some frustrating times where you get stupid card combinations like: 2 Barons (B-Baron, we call it), King + Princess (Regicide, we call it), and other very sub-optimal hands.

It often winds up a 50/50 of the burned card and the one the opponent has.

We quickly started playing Coup instead of Love Letter.

For something so simple, it's really an enjoyable ride. Best with 4 players I think, but with 3 it's still great and can be played with 2 (though I like it the least). Essentially  a bluffing and outguessing game with player elimination, but it plays so fast you won't even notice you're out of the round. Fun time filler for those excruciatingly long train and plane trips (can be taught even to complete newcomers in about three minutes).

With only 16 cards you would think this would be a simplistic and dull experience but there are a surprising amount of twists and turns in this game plus the whole family can play it. The designer has been very clever with using so few pieces and making a game that is simple but yet still a challenge.

And then you play it another dozen times and it actually re-grows on you. Although the game is simple I've begun liking it again.
 - that being said: between this and the Batman version, the Batman rules definitely adds another layer to the game!

Fun and simple little card game.  Not much thinking, but it's still fun to see if you will be able to win.  When we went to France (May 2013), we took a copy and found we could play this game just fine while standing in line (at various museums, etc....).  Recommended.

Update:  took my copy to disneyland in Oct 2013 to play in long lines.  The rubberband broke and so the cards were loose in my shirt pocket.  I completely forgot about them when I got on the Tower of Terror.  The cards levitated out of my pocket during the freefalls...and I wasn't able to recover them.  Ooops!

Description: Light, simple, deduction, bluffing, card game with player elimination.
Number of players: 2 to 4. Best with 4.

Impression: The game is a blast for what it contains. It's a brilliant design by Seiji Kanai, who made an exciting bluffing, competitive, deduction game with only 16 cards, which later became his signature attribute for many other games. The theme is cute, but the game play is quick and fun and it goes - draw a card, play a card, apply effect.  
Plays quick; Many different outcomes for a game with 16 cards. Poker-like outplays. Rewarding wild guesses.  Buy not so good with 2 players.

A very basic set of rules and components: each turn you draw a card and then discard one of the two cards in your hand, performing its effect (e.g. peeking at an opponent's card, swapping cards with an opponent, etc.).

Tough to rate this one because I have only played with two.  I don't think it's at its best with 2 as there is just too much info available however, we forgot to remove cards at the beginning so that might remedy this.  Not a bad filler and unique.  There are not many filler deduction games.  Update: played with three and this was a lot better.  Not a deep game and there is luck at place but there were laughs all around. it really just was simple easy fun.

Hugely overrated very simplistic card game. Even though it is a short game, it's random as hell and the annoyance factor is high. There is some game in here but it is ruined by the huge luck factor. People seem to reason that "the game is so short so I don't mind even if you drop out". Constantly hitting the leader makes the game longer than it should be. Playing to four cubes is just ridiculous, even one round is too much. Just a waste of time.

Kathryn and I have played this a few more times now and are still enjoying the game. It is a light game that doesn't overstay it's welcome and is fun to pull out every few days.

I threw it in my backpack over a vacation last week and we got 5 plays in while on the go. The small footprint made it a great way to pass the time while waiting for a show to start or our table to become available at dinner time.

Still haven't played with with more than two, but would love to do so.

[b]4 plays in:[/b]
Played a handful of games and my wife gives it the thumbs up so it should hit the table at least a few more times.

This game is very quick to teach, which I find helps immensely in getting a game played with my wife or family. It is also pretty short which means if someone doesn't like it, it's over soon!

Playing a 2 handed game to 7 points our matches after the learning game have taken 15-20 minutes. A round probably takes us a little over a minute on average with an occasional round ending on the first play, but some probably taking close to 2 minutes.

I get a kick out of being eliminated on the first play with a lucky Guard guess, etc (happens infrequently enough to hold its charm.) Also always great when one of us makes a dumb-dumb play to lose a round. For example, using King and trading the other player a Guard. Oops!

I bought this to supplement our supply of simple party games that can play relatively quickly. It has been a reasonable success. Each turn players draw a card, then either play it or keep it and play the card they previously held. The objective is to get to the bottom of the deck without being knocked out of the round and holding the highest value card possible.
Simple yet effective, the game is partly about bluffing, partly about reading opponents, partly about probability, and a lot about luck.
It is fun to play and easy to learn and we had it over in less than thirty minutes on a first play so it definitely fits the party game slot I had hoped for.

This was a big disappointment to me the first time I played it - while of course I wasn't expecting a deep strategy game, or anything pretending to be one, I was still disappointed in how few decisions there were and how random it all seemed (and how you can sometimes be eliminated early on through absolutely no fault of your own). But I have warmed to the game much more in subsequent plays - it's a great little end-of-night game, still pretty random but with some nice deduction and bluffing elements. And it's certainly quick and gets you talking.

There is no question in my mind that Lost Legacy is a much better implementation of the same concept (the deduction elements are bigger there, and it feels less random), but Love Letter is still a good game for what it is. And dare I say that I even enjoyed this as a 2p game, the one time we tried it, even though it's then more or less completely random and nothing to do with holding on to high cards, it's all about eliminating the other player before they do the same to you...

I love love letter. It's so simple to play in a few minutes with new players, really easy for children, no explaining needed, I mean the instructions you need at any point are literally on the cards that you hold in your hand. That's it. It really is as simple as can be and it is impossible to have a quicker set up.
While it obviously has a large luck element each iteration or hand is so quick that you can play several times to even it out.
My only tiny quibble is with the "story" rather than the ludic element of the game. It makes no sense. It doesn't interfere with the play but if you are sending letters to the princess how can you be the princess? I get how the handmaid would protect the princess but not the majority of cards in a hand etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I normally lean to more heavy and strategic games, but Love Letter is an absolute blast to play! It's a very light game that you can teach in about two minutes and play in about half an hour. Who wins in a two-player game is entirely based on luck, so I strongly suggest you play this one with three or four players. If you're looking for a fun filler game, I cannot think of a better game for you than Love Letter!

This game is quirky, in a good way. The rules suggest a game with barely any substance--a game of War with character abilities. After so many plays, I still do not see the connection with sending a love letter to the princess.

However, the more I played, and moreso with the same group, I noticed that a fun little metagame began to develop. The cards soon became more of a medium through which players express their behaviors, and the games evolved into lightning-quick romps of bluffing and gloating and gawking...with the right group. Therein lies the rub. The "right group" of players, those willing to roll with the prevalent punches of luck and take-that, can breathe life into what is, in truth, a fairly abstract card game. The contrary group will make this experience fall face-flat. A solid filler entry.

(+) Simple yet offering surprising amount of depth in gameplay.
(+) High player interaction.
(+) Quick rounds that complement the development of a metagame.

(-) Hefty amount of luck involved.
(-) Player elimination is frequent, and encouraged. This may not sit well with some.
(-) The liveliness of the game seems to hinge heavily on group attitudes.

A nice game to fill in the gaps between larger games or to wrap-up a game night.  With only 16 cards and a few tokens, doesn't need that much room to play, so has the advantage of portability as well as the ability to play while in line or on an airplane.

That said, much of the game is based upon the social psychology of the players as one is trying to deduce with limited information (only a few cards played per round) what other players might be holding so as to position one's self to win the round.  That said, there is also a splash of luck as the cards dealt sometimes can't be overcome (eg. receiving the minister in the Kanai edition and drawing a high rank card on your first turn), so players will have to deal with that as well.

Not a game to play repeatedly, but on occasion to avoid the limits card play getting too stale (which is why I have rated it a 6 instead of a 7 - need to be in the right mood to play this one.)

Probably the lightest, quickest game I own. The game itself is a deck of 13 cards, each card giving you a specific power or benefit when using it. All you have to do is have the highest ranking card when the game ends. Each game takes 15-30 minutes. Is it fun? Oh yes, and there are a few tricks which you will learn only after a few plays. Did I mention it's also hilarious at times when people screw up? We tend to laugh a lot when we play this game.

Love letter has to be the most fun, when compared to what the components are.  This game is not even the size of a Full deck of cards.  Only  sixteen cards and some cubes. You play as different characters trying to get letters to the queen. You are trying to deduce through social clues and revealing other cards who the other players have in their hands. 

Pros: Extremely Short game, Highly interactive Deduction., Portable and can be played anywhere.

Cons: Extremely short game. Player elimination.

Feels very random and you can even get eliminated before you have a chance to do anything. Of course, this complaint is mitigated by the short game time. This can easily be played in 5 minutes.

"Love Letter" is a card game with deduction and elimination gameplay. The game is played over several fast rounds so players aren't eliminated for long. I think it is a fun game accessible to casual gamers. 

My only complaint with Love Letter is that it lacks some flexibility when it comes to the number of players. It is designed for a maximum of four players and is best played with four players.

Love Letter is a fun, light game with a very small footprint (in playtime, rules weight, room needed to play,...). It's up to the task, whether you want to play it at the start of a gaming session (to get in the mood, or even to introduce new players to each other), in between games, or as a light-hearted laughter-filled cooldown after a heavier (tenser) game. You can play it with experienced as well as occasional gamers. The game just clicks with people (there's quite a few people who bought it after I introduced them to the game).

This game made me realize something: it's not bad rules or poor components that truly make or break a game. It's the people you play it with. They're the most important aspect of a good gameplay experience.

Finally, these are my thoughts on sleeving the cards. Since there's only 16 of them, they'll get worn pretty evenly. This means that you probably won't recognize a card by its damaged back. While I wouldn't go as far as buying sleeves for this game specifically, if you have some spares lying around don't hesitate to use them for Love Letter (that's what I did).

It's hard for me to really dislike Love Letter, since it basely registers as something I do or don't want to play. It's good in the "huh, that's neat" kind of way, a single thing that is accomplished well. Is that enough to make it really compelling? It depends on the situation I guess, but I think it's at least interesting in the abstract, even if I almost never play it by choice.

This is nothing more than a solid filler that works well for what it is supposed to do.  I actually expected a bit more from it before acquiring it, based on some of the praise I read for it.  While initially a bit disappointed to find it didn't have more deduction or meaningful choice, I have come to accept and enjoy it for what it is: a quick game, played in short rounds (so that being eliminated doesn't sting too much), in which there's just exactly enough thinking and agency involved to create some fun and make you feel you're playing a game (rather than following a script, as is this case with some filler or "light" games).

Played quite a bit of this one; find it best with 4 players and can't be bothered to play 3 player games any-more. 

Still sometime play a 2 player variant (2 cards in hand) - which works fairly well as a time waster, but has very limited tactics/strategy.

Best with new people, easy to grasp rules - although going over all the cards usually takes some time - a lot more than you would expect.

7 - as it suffers slightly in its group size - would be a perfect light party game, but there are better 4 player games to play.

Bonus points for simplicity, and if it was less reliant on text it would be perfect. Playing with my family (when travelling back home) involves translating all the cards on a sheet of paper every time (which takes time again).

Surprisingly quick and fun especially for a game of only 16 cards. Turns out to be a noisy game as players get very involved as their plans are ruined and they are ousted from the round. Although there's an element of luck, every turn you have to make a decision that could win or lose you the round. But because you play over a number of rounds you can try to reduce the luck factor.

Simple, quick and oh so much luck, but fun. There's some fun reading the moves others make and their faces to boot. A good travel game. Easily playable with kids as young as six. Easy to teach to infrequent gamers and we've had a lot of successful sessions introducing it to such players.

The Pegasus German boxed edition is a thing of beauty. Double thickness cards that are 50% bigger than normal gives it a great feel for a micro card game. Add the heart shaped tokens and you feel like you're getting your money's worth.

A near weight-less take-that/deduction game. It's not deep but it's so fast and clever you won't notice. Playing to 4 pts. might be too long, as it's just the same thing over and over, and it's not too hard for a table to decide someone is going to lose a round. 3 pts. may be better.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
OK, this is probably the simplest game I own.  I tend to break it out often when playing with new gamers because of how simple, but unique it is.  Players only ever have two cards, and they pick one to play to give them a special ability in trying to eliminate the other players that round.  Guess a card, trade, discard... If you are the last player in, you win the princesses favor for now (or a letter or something like that)!  There are many different versions of this game with different IP's that would fill in for this just fine though.  If you are interested, find one of the other themes you like more, like Batman or LOTR.

Holy overhyped, Batman!

So, on the very first round I was seated 2nd, and was out of the round before I had a chance to even play. As I immediately said to my friend sitting next to me: "That's a problem."

There were times you knocked people out thanks to clever deduction. And there were just as many times you knocked people out by blind luck.

For a game of this weight and length I'm actually okay with the amount of luck. That doesn't mean I want to play it again, though...

Coup is mostly bluffing and some deduction. Love Letter is almost no bluffing, and mostly deduction and luck. I much prefer Coup.

What a waste of $10. 

This game involves virtually no thought. "Do I play this card or this card?" is the deepest thinking that you can have. Often, you are forced to play one card. Often, you can lose a round without even playing a card. "Do you have a..." "Yes" "I win the round" is a common first turn. 

Summary:
- The game plays itself
- It has no difficult choices
- If you have a strategy, it probably won't matter
- even the theme is lame

And I like luck in games too!

I am amazed at just how much game can come out of 16 cards. I really like the light deduction game play. I also enjoy how thematic this game is.

With just 16 cards and a fairly short playing time this will come under the dreaded category of "filler", but don't let that put you off.

The game is easy to play and can be a short game or a long game.  The play itself is fast.  The rules are simple and the cards explain themselves.  Last one holding the Princess or the one who has the highest card wins the round.  First player to 5 (or 7 in the batman version) is the one who sent the love letter to the Princess (or captured all the villains). I keep this one in my purse for game playing on the go; however, I do recommend sleeving the game as who knows what nasty grubby stuff can get on the cards.

The filler to end all fillers. We needed something simple to start the night with, we also liked the portability of the game as we can take it to dinner or a friends house in my wife's purse just in case we're bored. This game is so easy to teach but after playing it a handful of times you start to see there is a strategy with it and once everyone is up to speed the game gets sort of intense. I love it.

A quirky microgame which has some clever interactions between cards that reveal themselves as the game goes on. It's true that for a large part of the game, the cards play you as having 2 cards in hand does not make for a lot of decisions, but there is also quite a lot of bluffing and deduction involved. Given the short playing time per round, it's a good compromise. Playing it until the recommended number of wins does make it run a little long though.

Many comparisons made between this and Coup.  Very different games that generate very different emotions. I prefer Coup, but Love Letter is just so elegant and digestible for non-gamers and "just wanna hang out" people. Both games have a role and a place in your collection.

A super quick filler game, that plays a lot better at 4 than it does at 3, and is just mediocre at 2. There isn’t a lot of strategy, as it is mostly just the luck of the draw, or maybe getting lucky with a Guard, but with a full four players it hums right along and produces a ton of laughs. This would be a great introductory game for people unfamiliar with the hobby, and for the $7 price tag I am certainly happy to have it in my collection.

Lovely filler game. Heavily luck driven of course, but so fast to play. Perfect when you get back from work and have half an hour to spare. Works best as a 4 player game. Not really suited to 2p. Have tons of plays at 4p.

A fun, light, filler game that is surprisingly good! I went in not really knowing what to expect with this one. I bought it on a whim after seeing one or two reviews, but not really paying much attention to them. It was only $10, so what the heck. 

I am glad I bought this. I can see this getting a lot of play in the future. The deduction aspect is great. I like that they mix it up with removing a card each round. I find myself enjoying everything about the game. I have played it with 3 and 4 players so far. I am looking forward to trying the 2 player rules.

Simple, quick and easy to play, but definitely has some tactics. I like that it's possible to deduce what other people might be holding. A fair bit of luck, but it's just a light little game so I don't mind so much if someone puts me out of the round with a lucky guess. A retheme is definitely in order though...

RATING: 10
This game is perfect for getting non-gamers into board/card games. The guys that I regularly play with bring their girlfriends to our game nights. The girls don't want to play our usual games because they look too complicated (too many cards, too many pieces, too many rules, too long, etc). The simplicity of Love Letter (and possibly the theme) always draws them in. 
The cards are well-balanced, simple enough for non-gamers to understand but the mechanics still provide a challenge to veteran gamers. Also, the rounds are quick and we can play an entire game in well under an hour. 
One thing that always gets negatively commented on are the tokens. We just have little, red cubes made of wood. Maybe heart-shaped tokens or printed coins or something more substantial and in line with the theme would be appreciated.

Célunk, hogy a lapok elfogyása után nálunk maradjon a legnagyobb értékű lap vagy minden játékostársunk kiejtsük valahogy. Gyors, egyszerű, pörgős partyjáték. Tökéletes átvezető, levezető.

RATING: 5
A few simple tricks, but don't expect real depth here. A 16 card game may be clever, but it ends up being just what it sounds like -- a 16 card game. It is not magically somehow deep.

Past that, it's a cute and fun novelty. Good as a filler option if you adjust the game length, but it can potentially run too long if the wins are spread out and you play to the official victory condition. Stopping anytime should be no problem though; additional rounds don't build on previous ones, and the bluffing elements are so light that nothing changes much game to game.

The guards are the fun part for me. The game stays around for too long for me to want to keep playing it. Seeing the cards already played leads the game to being a what is left game.

Love Letter seems almost as ubiquitous as a regular deck of cards these days. I really enjoy this game as it is extremely portable, quick to play, and easy to teach.

Clever little guessing game.  It's a nice enough filler, but frequently your games will be entirely decided for you based on what cards have come into your hand and what cards have been played.  In addition, it is not uncommon to be eliminated before you get a turn.  Hmmm.

Adore this game. Super light, easy to teach, easy to play, random enough so no one wins constantly, not so random that you feel like you can't get anywhere. Fits in a pocket, play it when waiting for food at a restaurant, between games, drinking game, fits a number of gaming groups and scenarios. One time I even wrote numbers on sugar packets to play it when I forgot to bring it to the restaurant. Only downside is 3-4 players.

RATING: 4
Very random and no real strategy/tactics. Also very bad if you get eliminated in the 1st round. 

People say there are bluffing in this game, but the few times I have played, there aren't any and this game isn't really about bluffing to begin with. 

Each turn you draw a card, does what it says and _hope_ you kill someone or don't die. When it's not your turn, there's pretty much nothing you can do. There's no strategy or tactic you need to think about. If you are targeted by another player when it's not your turn, the game doesn't offer you any way to react to it. 

Very bland game. People say there are strategy to this game, I just don't see any.

RATING: 7
If you want a two-player deduction game, try Coup. 

One example: A few of the cards feel less powerful in a two-player game, such as the Handmaidens. The rounds are more likely to end due to special abilities so trying to hold a Princess/Countess card in your hand doesn't seem like a good strategy.

If you want a three- and four-player deduction game, this one is very entertaining. Trying to read through everyone's supposed Poker faces and observing/analyzing the cards played on the table keeps you on your toes. Unlike two-player, rounds usually play through until the end and eliminating other players feels like a small victory in itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One day, I'll remember what all the different roles are.  I feel like I'll eventually learn what the min maxing strategy here is, then start doing consistently better.  This game comes out feeling like an investigative game, but its not really that tractable when anyone can shed the character they were within a single round.  It's a good game, but it plays out a bit randomly for my tastes.

Very simple deduction game.  At the beginning of each turn, players draw a card which depicts one of eight different roles, then play a card.  The last player standing is the victor.  If there are two or more players remaining after the deck runs out, then the person with the highest ranking card in their hand wins.  The major selling point of this game is its extreme portability and ease of teaching.

As an aside, we bought a bunch of these and gave them to our wedding party at our wedding.  It was fun.

I absolutely fell in love with this random convention purchase, which was the AEG red pouch/medieval looking edition. When the original artwork was reprinted, I had to have it! The game itself is a 9 for me. It's such a clever little deduction game for very few components. This reprinted factory edition gets a 10 as it includes 2 alternative number 8 cards - a 'nerdy' princess and a prince for those of us who would chase the affections of a non-typical character.

I played the L5R edition of Love Letter with friends, and we had a good time playing about 10 games. I didn't super enjoy the art style of that edition, but it looks like the original edition is better, and easier to identify a card straight away, so I'd like to check it out.

Bought as a light filler alongside No Thanks, this arrived on February 13th, at which point I realised it would make a perfect valentine's gift for my significant other. Being a non-gamer, she said thank you, it's lovely and promptly gave it back. Result!
Since then this has been a hit, particularly with the female members of the family who love the theme, such as it is. Very, very light, with the occasional 'Hah!' moment. Can be played twice at most in a session before moving on to meatier stuff.

RATING: 6.5
2-3 plays at MACE

What a [i]brilliant[/i] little game! It reminds me, unsurprisingly, of [thing=2051]Pico[/thing] and [thing=606]Pico 2[/thing]: games with tiny little decks of cards that play quickly and are all about getting into your opponent's head. This game, though, has a bit more randomness and a lot more flavor. Instead of just playing numbered cards, you're playing people with special powers. Instead of playing 2 mirror hands, you play several (winning score varies by player count: 4, 5, or 7 hands) drawing from a single, randomly shuffled deck. The differences make this game much less an exercise, and much more fun. All in just 16 cards and some cubes!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Shuffle the 16 cards (numbered 8, 7, 6, 5x2, 4x2, 3x2, 2x2, 1x5) and deal 1/player. In a 2-player game, remove 1 from the round unseen, and place 3 face up in display.

On your turn, draw a card from the deck, then play a card in front of you (on top of any previously played cards). Each card has a different power, and may result in a player being eliminated from the round. Continue play till only 1 player remains: score a VP (cube).

Repeat playing hands until one player has 1 + (12/n) cubes = winner!

I was incredibly surprised by this game.  I usually don't like small, light games.  I like games with a lot of meat and depth.  For this reason I don't have many short time fillers.  I was certain I was going to be bored with this game which only includes 16 cards.  I was very wrong, in the category of games that only fill 10-20 minutes (including teaching and setup time) this may be my favorite game.

It is so simple and elegant in its design yet incredibly interesting and fun.  Plus the game just has that charm that makes you feel good when playing and ready to shuffle up and play another.

This rating will drop but our first game of this was just hilarious.  This is a very light weight game but was flat out enjoyable to play.  My daughters played the game using fake British accents and the comedic commentary was side splitting.  There are decisions but you don't have to think to hard leaving you free to goof around.  My favorite moment was when I had to discard the Countess and everyone knew I had the Princess.  My daughter put down the Guard, and everyone else said bye-bye Daddy, and she said in her best British accent, "Father, I assassinate your..... King!" and my oldest shouted "What!" and I said "Nay Nay" with everyone rolling in laughter.  For under $10 you cannot go wrong.

Random but fun to play. Sometimes if one gets out of the round too soon maybe two or even three times in a row (which is possible given the randomness of the game) it becomes a bit boring and frustrating.

I've never played another game that plays this fast. It's true that maybe half of the decisions you'll be making will be basically automatic, but if you're making 2-3 decisions a minute, that still leaves you with a lot more meaningful decisions per unit of time spent playing than many other "meatier" games.

Great filler. It is pretty amazing what can be done with such a small deck of cards. Strategy, bluffing and luck mingle with a slight advantage for the luck factor. Played in several rounds I would advice to play with the max of 4 players to get the full enjoyment out of it.

Surprisingly, Love Letters is a really fun game for the Light category! I like playing it.  It's more a simple deduction game as you "action" one of the two cards in your hand every round (total cards in the game are only 16 cards I think).

It's a great family game especially for younger kids maybe teens (who can read and deduce a bit).

There are times where you're really just forced to action your "play" for the round either to avoid losing or because the card the situation at that moment triggers one of your cards to "require" to "play" your next card out accordingly (meaning you don't have a choice).  Can gets repetitive quickly if you overplay it. Really meant for a "quicky" every once in awhile not as your main event for the whole evening of repetitive play.

Yet the game is still fun if you keep in mind how simple 
and Light it really is.

It's ingenius and so elegant! Bravo to the creators!!

A quick filler that, once I break it out, I have to play at least several games at a time.  Even though the theme doesn't attract everyone, it's super easy to pick up and no one ever feels out of it.  However, I would never play this with experienced gamers as it begins to feel a bit deterministic.

I'm a 7, while my girlfriend is a 6. We like that it can be quickly picked up and played, and that it's tiny enough to take and play anywhere. There are moments in the game, however, where you really are a slave to the rules (forcing you to a hand's conclusion without being given a choice). Also, bluffing with only two players is pretty much not an option. This is one we'll still play every now and then though.

A very good micro game.  It deserves its reputation.  It is easy to teach and can be played quickly.  It tends to get repetitive plays.  The only thing that I can see hurting it, is that it is not truly deep.  There are optimal strategies for a hand in a circumstance and because the hands are few and the relevant circumstances fewer, it will get to a point where its depth is exhausted.

Great game. One of my favorites. Perhaps it will decline over time as the game gets played out, but I can't help but be impressed with how much fun can come out of just 16 cards! When you are first learning the rules it comes off as a simplistic game with 100% luck. There is certainly luck involved but the strategy is richer than you think. Even though you never have more than 2 cards in your hand, there is much to think about. Although it doesn't have the depth and length to go beyond just a filler game, I often play it between heavier games. In fact it's a great finisher. It's like the dessert of card/board games. It's short and sweet.

Hasn't held up over the years. It is still okay, but I feel like so many of the decisions are too straight forward and obvious. I also wish that there weren't any protection abilities as the Hand Maidens just make the game even more boring.

I bought this for my wife (Valentine's Day present).  We played our first game with our 11 year old son.  He liked it and wanted to play again.

Just taught our five year old daughter how to play and she likes it too!  

After recording our 16th play of Love Letter I realized that we have not rated it yet.  So I asked everyone in the family what they would rate Love Letter.  Here are there responses.

Wife:  A 10.
11 year old son:  9 pauses...8.
5 year old daughter: 10.  Love it!

I think my enjoyment of the game is higher than the actual quality of the game...I would probably give it a 7.   It is fun and fast though.

Quick playing deduction game. Players are each dealt a card, each depicting one of eight different characters, and on their turn draw another one. From the two cards they now hold they choose one to play, which will interact with an opponent in some way. For instance, the guard allows the player to try and guess an opponent's card, which would mean they would have to discard it, the handmaid means you're immune to opponents' cards for a turn, the king allows you to exchange your hand with an opponent, and so forth. the winner is the either the only person not to have discarded a card, or the person in possession of the highest value card once the deck has run out. This is a fun deduction game with a large proportion of luck, but due to the quick play time and if not taken too seriously is definitely worthy of consideration as a 'filler'.

A simple card game where players have 1 card in hand and draw 1 on their turn. Each card has a value of 1-8 and a special ability associated with that card. On their turn players play 1 card and follow the ability as outlined on the card. Through a process of strategy, reason, and deduction you are attempting to eliminate players from that particular hand. The player who wins a predetermined amount of hands (usually 4 or 5) is the victor. This game is best with 4 players.

You don't need me to tell you about this game. I found it slightly better than Coup though it is far simpler. It just seems to work and flow better for me whilst Coup tries to be so much more but misses the mark, falling in an uncomfortable middle ground. I'd be interested to see if the new Inquisitor role fixes Coups problems.

Played it twice at a friends'. Seemed a bit dry, as it was quite easy to figure out what card to play and what to keep.

It is a nice filler, but nothing more.

[UPDATE] Friend made a re-themed GoT version. Greatly enhanced atmosphere, as we could get more into our roles actually. I find the game itself stays too random for me, but for a filler game I could get talked into it once in a while.

Starting to lose interest in this one, there really isnt any depth to it although it does have creative mechanics. The time factor seems about right, but then when you pay to four it seems repititious. I think the game would be much better with more characters and a better scoring system instead of gaining one pt. I dont know how many repeated plays this will stand up to.

Two princesses and a prince to compete for in this remake of the original Japanese game. The Minister is a little more of a pain to have in your hand than the Countess in the AEG version which causes you to lose on the spot if you have any card of five or higher in your hand at the same time.

Gripe about Love Letter still stands: it's Euchere.

RATING: 8.5
Note: This rating is based on the Japon Brand version rather than the AEG version. Because of the AEG rules changes (and only very slightly because of the new artwork) I'd rate the AEG version a full point lower.

Love letter is a marvellously clever little game with a huge amount of fun, choices and great design packed in to 16 cards.

An absolute gem of a game and a perfect example of a design with no padding added (take note FFG!).

Okay, so it's moderately luck based, but I don't care; and when it takes 5 minutes, you shouldn't either. Stunning.

Alright, this game is great fun, and for only 16 cards, and can be taught in about 2 minutes, and can be played in about 10 minutes.  Uh, this one is a winner.

After a bit of time, it kind of loses its luster a bit.  Because it's so small, nearly every interaction is seen after only a few games, then you're just kind of going through the motions at that point.  It's still fine mainly because it's so short, but it just doesn't have enough oomph to keep it around or make it a staple.

-Some room for misdirection plays.

Cons:
-Seems too random.
-More metagame than game (which I don't enjoy much).
-Random Guard assassinations first turn are just unfun.

A fantastic filler for anyone. My six year old plays this and is good. It's a game that you might say is dependent on luck, but it doesn't feel like luck. There's a little bit of deduction going on. It's just funny to know someone out of the round, because each round is about a minute or two. It's cute, the little booklet has a cheeky little fun story, and I got the baggie version for $8. Recommend!

RATING: 8
Love letter is a wonderful, light, fun game, but only if you have 4 players. At 3, it's okay, and at two, there are many other games that are better. However, at 4 players, it's portable and can be played anywhere (even on an airplane!), has a lot of interaction between players, is quick (rounds can take between 2 and 8 minutes). There is a slight amount of math and bluffing involved, as well as some player elimination (which only lasts a few minutes). All in all, a fantastic filler or short game to play while waiting for food or drinks.

Super light, and unlike most I love player elimination when it is done well, and it is done really well in this game particularly due to it's speed and as it's played in rounds. The game is quite luck based, with juuuust enough strategy; choosing between two cards sounds like a terrible game, but I admire Love Letter's ability to make that fun and actually have any strategy whatsoever.

I like this game quite a bit. Mostly because I think it is great for such a short simple game. There are always fun situations happening which keeps it fun for all the rounds.

Short and sweet game that wins many friends over and allows for some bluffing. Fun to play it in pairs (2 players to a hand). However, the theme is too feminine and turns many people off. I play the Hobbit rethemed deck more often now so that men don't feel left out. But this is still in my collection, and I don't care about winning because it is so hilarious to be called out of the game.

Love Letter is an extremely light, hilarious game that showcases just how fun sixteen cards can be. I particularly enjoy the player elimination mechanic because it's not obnoxious and adds to the experience. It plays much like a party game--so the more people, the better, simply because they add to story. But the two-player game is really good too, and my husband and I always end up laughing and having a good time competing for the princess' affection. Of course, the gameplay can get a bit repetitive with only sixteen cards, but not as much as you might expect. Also, the cards wear down pretty quickly due to excessive shuffling. But the price is definitely right for a quick filler.

When it was released it was an awesome samll card game of novelty. It started a trend of micro-games at a huge scale we know them now. Similar to other games that starts a trend (for example Dominion for deck-buildings) it aged quickly and with many more micro-games around and after dozens of plays it lacks the spark. Still it was nice thing to have around for several years and that's a fact nobody can take from this game. ;-)

The AEG win conditions push the game length to the edge of wearing out its welcome.  I think ending when the first player gets three (or even just two) cubes instead of four would be the sweet spot.

RATING: 8
Rating based on just a couple of plays, but I like it a lot so far. Good little filler that can be learned in just a couple of minutes and each round lasts just a few minutes. The interactions between the different cards and the guessing elements make for some funny moments.

Update: Played some more and I'm really liking it. It can go on for just a little too long if you play the recommended number of rounds, but we usually just play a few rounds until we're ready to move on.
A lot of luck involved, a lot of guessing, and just a little bit of deduction and bluffing makes this one a lot of fun.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
With two players there's just no reason to play. A player can get eliminated almost immediately, due to the luck of the draw, and then you just start another round where the same thing happens.

This is an outstanding game *in the right circumstances*.
It's simple, fast, fun to play and I'd never turn a game down. It's an ideal gateway game and I regularly play it with family, friends and non-gamers. However there are times I just want more from a game, I want a big box brain boggling meaty game with lots of wooden bits. And that's ok because Love Letter doesn't pretend to be anything its not.
I had this at a 10 for a long time but I dropped it to a 9 to reflect that there's a time and place.

RATING: 7.5
Part of my rating is how impressed I am with the design - a lot of fun and flexibility in just 16 cards of only 8 types.

It scales well from 2-4 and even more with two decks. 

Update: I really like this one, but it seems to confound non-gamers more than I would have imagined. Not so much that I won't play it with non-gamers, indeed, I have had good success with it, but both card play and the deduction are novel ideas for people who are not in the hobby and it makes it non-intuitive.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 5

A card game with only 16 cards, each of the 8 different types of cards has a unique ability, each turn draw one card and play one, eliminate everyone or have the highest valued card when the deck is emptied to win!

Sleeved.

RATING: 8.5
The best small card gateway game available in my opinion. I should really give this a 10 but after many plays you can get burnt out fairly easily on this as its biggest strength of being simple and small is also its weakness for more experienced gamers. I could go on for days about how great this small game is and I will happily play this whenever anyone offers.

I really like this game for what it is. It's a very fast little luck based deduction game. However, I don't mind how much luck there is in this game, it's fun to play, it's one that I can pull out with people and play in a spare minute or two, and if it was more complex, I think it would lose some of that fast and fun feel.

What I like:


-Very portable! I almost always have this with me just cause why not and the back can easily handle this. 
-It's also short and simple so you can play this with anyone. 
-It's definitely value for Money! This game is dirtcheap so you might as well get it.

What I dislike:
It gets a little boring after a while. I guess that is the faith of any very simple game.

[thing=129622][/thing] is a testament to the power of the design: a whole game inside sixteen cards!

It is said that the game lasts about 20 minutes, but ours took about 40 minutes, though I can see that, when everyone knows the cards well (not a difficult task), the play time will severely drop - so 20 minutes is definitely not out of question.

The theme passes nowehere near the actual gameplay: the players represent suitors to the love of the Princess, wanting that their love letters reach her. This isn't easy, since, after the arrest of the Queen, the Princess is bound to be inside the palace, under watch. So the suitors must try to use the Guard, the Handmaid, the Priest, the Baron, the Prince, the Countess and even the King to achieve the their purpose: to win the Princess affection and heart.

Each player has a card in hand and, in his turn, must take another one from the draw pile, then is mandatory to discard one of them, applying its effect. If any player is left without a card in hand (due to the effect of some card), he/she is out of the round. The round ends when only one player has a card in hand, or when the draw pile is empty - in the first case, the player wins outright; in the second case, the player holding the card with the higher number (which, in the theme, represents the person closest to the Princess) is the winner of the round. The number of rounds a player must win in order to be the overall winner varies accordingly to the number of players.

[thing=129622][/thing] is fast, fun and full of decisions to be made - usually not a hard one, so the game suits easily to non-gamers of any sort. For gamers, though, is rather light, so you can't count on a night of [thing=129622][/thing] games. It is an ice-breaker and/or night ender. Álso, be aware that [thing=129622][/thing] isn't a party game: it only accommodates up to 4 players.

A nice game that stays inside a lovely red draw bag. For its price, it was an excellent purchase!

One of my favourite fillers, mainly because it's fast and fun and, because it plays so quickly, even getting knocked out by a lucky guess on the first round is more amusing than irritating. There's certainly a strong luck element and there are times when there's only one way to play but I don't find it at all repetitive or boring. Not everybody's cup of tea, I guess, but quite accessible to non-gamers (including kids). Best with 4 players (also plays well with modifications that take it up to 5-6).

A simple deduction/bluffing game to play with families and friends. 
Game time is short. The game is very portable with just 16 cards. This will likely be another game that we can bring along with us when we are outside besides Hive. The other good thing is it is very light!

We have tried the 2-player version and find that it is not as fun as the 4-player version.

This is my design using the Love Letter rules set. Everyone seems to like playing these cards pretty well, I finally completed the graphics with much better fonts, and now it is more or less complete. I wish I would remember to make everything completely different than the original to allow sharing the result, as now the wording on the cards is verbatim, so I can't post online. I think it came out really good. (I did the same thing with Modern Art, using the same icons on the cards preventing me from making my results available. I don't expect I'll ever go back and fix that.)

Overall:
This is a game everyone should have in their collection and is the best filler I've played.  There is a base level of strategy that is accessible to all players which ensure players are almost always on a level playing field.  The game does a great job at making you feel smart because the strategy unravels itself organically as you play.

Great filler game and incredible ratio of gameplay to components. Simple mechanics encourage quick play, including some elements of luck, bluffing, and short & long term strategy (long meaning a minute from now).

Plays fine with 5 even though it's rated to 4. Almost no downtime keeps people engaged. Very few people I know that won't kill time with a game of this while waiting. (And still manages to create good stories when you explain why you did what you did after each round.)

Perfect travel game.

Sure, this game has plenty of player elimination and is extremely unpredictable with loads of luck. You can easily get eliminated before playing a hand or be forced to reveal your identity through no fault of your own. The game contains only a handful of cards and the art is mediocre at best and resembles famous actors (Baron von Trapp, I am looking at you!). However, with all the shortcomings, this game still shines. It is fun and a hoot with the right folks. Each round takes roughly 10 minutes and even though there is elimination, it rarely matters as everyone is eager to go for the next hand. A huge bang for the buck!

101913: Obtained the original Kanai special edition reprint from AEG because of the art. I like the art, the new box and the cards. I love the new Priestess function but am on the fence with the minister. It does feel cheap losing on the opening round when you get above 12+ on the minister. May have to use the modified rule

Elegant and entertaining choose and play game. With just sixteen cards and some wooden bits this game is both gripping and rewarding. It has hooked quite a few non-gamers and a bunch of the old hardcores. Very easy to approach and surprising amount of replayability. Bluff might gain you edge and it is surprising how often you play the wrong one of the two cards you have to choose from. Despite occasional no-win hands this game plays well, has a feel of lightness and elegance and is a looker despite the low price. For anyone who like to spend time with a small bunch of good people.

A beautifully produced, fantastic little card game that fits in your pocket.  
It's been called a pub game but, depending on who you go to the pub with, you might get a few odd looks at your local after pulling out a scarlet velvet bag with "love letter" embroidered on the side.  
Definitely sleeve your cards however as they'll be getting a lot of handling. Also, do yourself a favor and replace the red cubes with wooden heart tokens from Meeplesource. Nice.

There is just too much luck in this game for my liking. I'd give it a 10 on being able to pull off a fun filler game with just a few cards, it's quite amazing. However some times I'm knocked out before I've even had a chance to go, or after my first turn, maybe that's the appeal to the game but it makes me feel like a helpless victim.

In any case definitely worth the small investment for a game that is easy to teach and quick to play!

Kanai vs Tempest? Tempest. Overall, both are good games. They are easy to learn and quick to play through. Really enjoyable without breaking a sweat. I picked Tempest over Kanai as it adds more misdirection into the game, effectively increasing the depth of strategy. 

Not an essential game to own, not a highly recommended game to start the hobby with, but a good change of pace for the seasoned gamer.

Great filler game. Player elimination mechanic is not a problem because of the short rounds and the partial information: the wanting to know what the other players had is enough to keep you interested for the couple of minutes it takes to finish a round. Might be more fun if it were a bit roleplay-ier? The game plays very independently of its flavour.

Possible to add/drop players mid-game (between rounds) but you have to decide what to do about score/handicap in that case.

[i]"Average. No significant appeal, take it or leave it."[/i]

It works, it's clever, cheap and portable but I rarely game with 4 or less players and when we don't have the time for something more interesting.

Coup might just be better than this, not sure yet.

Update: This is actually more fun with 5 player which suggests that the core idea works better the less deduction you can make. Weird.

I wasn't so sure about the theme of love letter, but it turns out to be a great game. I'm always a fan of hidden role games, but this simplifies it to the point that you can finish games in about 15 minutes. I like the fact that it can be played with 2 people, but it definitely works best with 4. I kind of wish that it could have even more people because it would be a fun party game, but with the way the role abilities currently work I'm not sure that is feasible. Oh well, I'll just have to enjoy it the way it is.

A friend had a copy, and it looked interesting.

It should be the other way around. Months later my rage went down, and tried it. Fun game, a little better than Coup.

AEG version. Getting a scratched card from shrinkwrap was a downer but customer service was great and I received a replacement card within a week. The game itself is a great little filler. Lightweight and takes very little time to teach. I could not resist the rethemeing possibility and quickly made a star wars version which improves the experience noticeably with geeky gamers. Too bad a retheme won't solve the shallow gameplay(not always a bad thing). Luckily there is Lost legacy when we want a little more meat with our microgame.

I'm a bit puzzled that this seems to have the BGG community so excited.  This simple little guessing game is nothing more than a minimal set of cards with a dash of reading your opponent.  In other words, this is exactly the kinds of stuff that makes BGG disdain mainstream games like [gameid=1115] or [gameid=1917], or in it's purest form, the strangeness that is competitive Rock, Paper, Scissors tournaments.  Sure, it's light, but there's nothing of real interest here.  I could never play again and not miss it.  If you're looking for filler, let's play [gameid=172] or [gameid=16267].

Rated after two short games, first one with only 1 round, second one with 7 rounds. Ok game, fast, easy and so on, but nothing mind blowing so far.

Updated after third game, three players and to the five points - the game lasted 13 rounds. Now it is clear, that there is a game there, the amount of luck is big, so it is necessary to play multiple rounds. The game is basically a deduction game, because there are so few cards.

Updated after fourth game, two players to seven points. Two player game felt more luck oriented than the three player game, dropped the rating from 6 to 5. Deduction and luck are the strongest elements here.

16 cards of wich you put 1 aside without looking. Your goal is to be the first to get enough coins. 

A lot of the game is trying to find out wich card yyour opponent has. Some of those little rounds take seconds others a few minutes. 

A nice filler.

The emperor's new clothes - there is nothing there - literally (16 cards in a brown envelope) and gameplay wise. Mostly random with few meaningful decisions, but at least it is very short. Should be called Poke The Princess instead of Love Letter. Not much of an actual "game", but it is an ok fun filler activity.

So fast, easy, and small. My friends and I have had WAY too much fun with this and we're into some deep board games. Doesn't require a ton of thought, but rewards those who pay attention and learn their opponent's "tells." You can teach it in five minutes and the specific theme is just way too fun. Put on some renaissance music and go nuts.

Everything you've heard about this game is true.  It plays quickly, and allows for some interesting bluffing/hand management decisions during the game.  Once people get into it, they want to play it again right away.  It's well balanced, fun, easy to learn, and so small and portable that almost everyone will want to get one.

It's also nearly impossible to not compare this to Coup, since they're so similar.  They both have weaknesses and strengths compared to one another, and they're also different enough in the way that you have to play them to justify getting them both.  Right now, Coup gets the nod between the two of them, but that won't keep me from getting this one, too.  Once AEG reprints it, that is.

Love Letter is a proof of concept, later expanded in the Lost Legacy series by the same designer.

This game is very simple, and definitely fun! A rating of 7 seems severe for me, for a game I like, but that's only because you should really just be playing its big brother. There's an actual game there, in the form of a desperate, card counting search for a particular card in the deck, balanced with not getting eliminated and also retaining your claim to actually search for it at all.

In Love Letter, you are instead merely trying to hang in there, not get eliminated, and, if it comes to that, have the highest card in your  hand when the deck runs out. A lot of this is chance, but there is some definite strategy, mainly revolving around obfuscating what your actual hand card is. You can play cards that are normally only played when you're holding certain others, to make it look like you are, when you're not. You can watch carefully for someone who always seems to be playing "automatically", as if they don't have a choice between their cards - that usually means they don't, because their hand card is the unplayable Princess, which you should call them out on ASAP before they win. Et cetera. It's amazing what Seiji did with just these few cards. This is, far and away, a fantastic game for families and children, who don't need to know anything special to play well. The theme is universally enjoyable, unless you're insecure in your masculinity so much that red velvet makes you uncomfortable... at which point, just play Batman Love Letter. That's also great.

Then sneak in Lost Legacy when no one is looking.

RATING: 7.2
It's quick, simple and good fun. Very quick to learn, very portable (can carry the whole game rules and all in my back pocket). Can foresee a lot of plays of this as it is very easy to whip out with any crowd as a warm up, filler or anytime really.

It is quick game which is it's main virtue but I actually don't always think it is quick enough and quite like to play with fewer than the recommended rounds, as there is no long term strategy this makes no difference to the play. Have started playing with the rule from Batman variant, this brings it closer to the speed the game feels it should play.

It's rare that I revisit this game, only because of other options, however when I do I'm always impressed by the elegance of this game design.

It's rather unbelievable how much game is hidden in this tiny 16 card deck. It only plays four, but it brings all of the fun bluffing and second guessing that you find in bigger social games like The Resistance or Werewolf. It's nice to no longer need a huge group to get that experience. It plays super quick, creates plenty of laughs and always makes you feel like the game is one lucky guess away from generating an angry table flip. Good times...

Card game.
Deduction, player elimination (not to worry, rounds resolve quickly).
Light weight - all rules printed on cards!
High player interaction.
Medium-high theme application (high in that there's plenty of opportunity for emergent/meta-narrative).

Super approachable and usually funny once players establish mastery (particularly of dynamics) which happens quite quickly.

All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess. Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, and you must rely on others to take your romantic letters to her. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game.

RATING: 8
Great game for only being 16 cards.  Does have a bit of luck, which made me hesitant to pick this up, but it's quick and mitigated by multiple rounds.  Rounds are very quick, but there is quite a bit of tension and deduction going on.

The version with the princess that I have really should have gone with hearts instead of cubes, but I'm sure that would have raised the price.

It is a terrible game with just 2 players, though, so only great with 3 or 4.

One of the first micro-games out there. Deduction, role selection (kinda), and "love cubes". Not sure how much replayability there because after years of play there is not much surprise left - just card counting for the non-expanded base game.

After 10 plays, it's still great! Not much strategy I'm afraid, but it all come down to luck of the draw and luck to guess.

Ooh I'm so wrong. After even more plays with the same people it's more strategic than ever. Now the beauty of the game comes in as you're playing against the PEOPLE and not the odds or the system. Did he discard the Countess because he had a king or Prince or because he wants us to think so? Hmm...

UPDATE: Although a bit more luck based than a lot of the fillers I own. I have to push this up for the sheer number of plays I have managed with my kids. They love it. My 7 year old boy has totally got many of the strategies now and knows what cards he should play when paired up. My 5 year old still has a bit of trouble but sometimes hits his mark all the same! Still, he loves it too.
My rating has dropped a point with subsequent play.There's a heavy dosage of luck which makes it not quite as good as some of my favourite fillers like for sale and high society. Still, it's quicker to play and maybe you should just play first to 3 points, for an uber quick filler. Also, my kids (5&7) love the game and ask daily to play a game.

When I wasn't swooning and sighing, I was enjoying this light card game of royal lovemaking - in the [url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/courtship]old-fashioned[/url] sense of the word.  Someone can be knocked out of a round immediately - even before playing a card - but it doesn't matter, since each round is only a few minutes long.

Best when played in sparkly red card sleeves, of course.

I find Love Letter to be a beautiful game. It's probably the best game with the least components ever. Love Letter was the first game to introduce me into the deduction subcategory.

10+ plays, mostly with 3 or 4 players. 

Like: Love Letter packs more gameplay into sixteen cards than many full-fledged board games. You can easily introduce all of the cards in a few minutes, and it only takes a couple rounds for new players to familiarize themselves with all of these cards. This makes Love Letter fantastic as a game to introduce to so-called "non-gamers" since it's quick and easy fun, and the game mechanics themselves can be mastered with little effort. Yet Love Letter retains its charm after many games, which is rare among short games. There is player elimination within the individual rounds of a game, but a round is so fast that there is practically no wait for the next round to start. The same goes for being dealt bad cards in a given round. 

One of the brilliant (yet so simple) aspects of the game which greatly increases its longevity is the removal of one card from the deck in each round. This ensures that a player can never have perfect information in the game unless they have peeked at their opponents' hand using the Priest. Thus bluffing and misdirection are always possible. Aiding this is the fact that the cards are very tightly balanced and designed to give rise to many opportunities for such misdirection. The Countess is a great example; new players will typically only discard her if they have a Prince or King in hand, but then they quickly realize that sometimes it's better to discard the Countess even when they don't necessarily have to, just to mislead other players about their hand. 

Love Letter does an incredible job (with so few cards!) of balancing two paths to victory. You can win by having the highest card remaining at the end of the round, or by knocking all other players out of the round. In my experience, most rounds end with all but one player being knocked out, but the potential for a high card victory is always on everyone's mind and influences most decisions. Because these two different options for success are available, it's surprisingly rare to have a round in which you have no hope of winning.

Dislike: At Love Letter's level of complexity, an 8 is really the highest that I can rate it. With only sixteen cards and "draw one, play one" gameplay, there is not much flexibility within the game's structure for tactics or strategy beyond basic bluffing and deduction. There are rounds (especially if you start with the princess) in which your hand will just play itself, and your only input into the game is to try to mislead everyone else with what you say and how you act. However, the rounds are so quick, and this only tends to happen at most one or two times within a game, so that this is acceptable. What's not so acceptable is that the rapid-fire nature of the rounds (combined with the tiny hands and low card count) means that you will very quickly encounter the majority of the possible game situations (card combinations in hand, opponent's possible cards, etc.). This means that the game's "newness" fades quickly, so you need a good and involved player group to keep Love Letter lively and fun beyond a couple games.

My only other gripe is that it is quite frustrating to get knocked out of a round at the very beginning (before I've had a chance to do anything) by a random Guard guess. However, the speed of the game makes this forgivable.  

Additional note: Because there are so few cards, the cards tend to very quickly show signs of wear which can ruin the game by making certain cards identifiable. I recommend sleeving the cards as quickly as possible.  

Overall: If you like bluffing of any sort, you need to own this game. The best filler game I've played so far.

RATING: 7.7
Very light, very quick.

Nearly everyone I've introduced it to loves it. 

Definitely not one to make an evening out of, but with no setup time it's perfect when people are sitting around waiting for others to arrive.

Sometimes it can be lame to get eliminated on a lucky guard guess right out of the gate. But normally the hands are so short this doesn't matter too much.

Light and as much to do with the luck of the draw as anything, but fun. There's more skill involved here than may appear at first, but you have so few turns and it's so easy to get knocked out by a lucky guess that it's never going to be more than a light diversion. It also seems to typically take us double the "official" play time, or even more.

I bought a second copy so I could accommodate more than 4 players. I add 2 Guards, 1 Priest, 1 Baron and 1 Handmaid. It works well for 5 or 6 (winner is first to 3 in both cases). It's not many extra cards, but the speed with which players get knocked out means you don't need  many.

Intriguing game. It got me curious. But I can get past the fact that it feels always the same.

Edit (May 2017): After talking more about the game, I can believe that the meta gaming on this one might make it more interesting: if you play if 4 or 6 times on a row, then people's repeated actions enhance the "bluffing game". However, I don't truly want to play Love Letter for a hour long, that would defeat the purpose (for me) as a Micro Game.

This is as good as small, portable filler kind of games get. It's simply brilliant how a game with 16 cards can be so much fun every time. You can learn to play it in minutes, it's setup in seconds and plays so quick you almost can't stop playing. Especially out on the terrace with a beer or two. 

It's a mix of deduction and luck, so everyone can win this game too. It's just hilarious at times when you switch cards only so the next player knows what you have and kills u with a baron for example. Or ending the game with a king and princess, having to switch your hand with the other player and lose. It's just a lot of fun!

The only downside is the theme. It doesn't really appeal to me. Delivering letters to the princess doesn't make sense to me at all when playing the game. But it doesn't affect the gameplay though. Just forget the stupid letters ;)

Update: does lose it's magic after a while though.

Played this once. The overall feeling was kind of meh. This won some kind of award for innovative play? It doesn't say exactly in the instructions but it's basically, "draw 1, play 1." Last person with cards in their hand (or person with the highest ranking card) wins the round. Repeat until victory point goal is achieved.

** The more you play this, the better it gets. Also helps to play with others who can also find joy in tiny, simple things. It's great fun with the right folks and won't cost much more than a snooty cup of coffee.

By now, I'm sure everyone has heard of this game.

RATING: 6
Played once with 2 players. I think it will be better with more. 

Update: played twice with 3 players, too. It's been a while since I had such a good laugh: continuously using the Guard to accuse someone of having the Countess or the Princess while the other player had that card was really awesome. The laughter that ensues when a player gets 2 Barons and is therefore kind of out of the game instantly also ensued much laughter, as well as Elise (at least) thrice playing the King while she had the Guard in her hand...

RATING: 9
A very quick deduction game for 2-4 players with only 16 cards. Each turn, players draw a card to get a hand of two, then play one of those and use its ability. The person with the highest value card at the end of the game wins, assuming there's more than one person left in.

A surprisingly fun game of guessing and bluffing, even though there is only a small number of game components. Despite its simplicity, the game has some depth and is therefore quite replayable. The main downside is the 2-player game is not as fun. The artwork is attractive and components are good quality. Most importantly, the game is very portable.

What a fantastic game for something so simple and tiny; it's a game of just 16 cards for crying out loud!

I ordered the original [company=7552][/company] version after coming home from SPIEL in Essen and playing the game at a Swedish con, and have now learned to not pass by the [company=5885][/company] booth at SPIEL again without buying [person=9495][/person]'s new releases.

Funny enough I got to play [company=396]AEG[/company]'s City-State of Tempest version first and love it! Best of all I'm excited that the two versions of the game differ not only in character graphics and names, but they also contain have slightly different effects and rules. Awesome! This is enough reason to own both versions, right?  :D

Love Letter is absolutely my kind of game. I love games where the ease of play and barrier to entry is very low, but there's a surprising amount of interesting game play once you delve in. I'm also a huge fan of games with poker elements, and by that I mean things such as keeping a poker face, bluffing, double-bluffing, deduction, and meta-gaming. Wonderful game!

I can also report that the [company=396]AEG[/company] edition is gorgeous and of very high quality. If you can get the version in the velvet bag with score counters, nab it immediately! [company=7552][/company]'s original Love Letter which comes in an envelope that looks like an actual love letter is also amazing. To heck with it, just get both versions!

[size=14]Differences between [company=7552][/company] and [company=396]AEG[/company] versions:[/size]

[b]Winning:[/b] In [company=7552][/company]'s original version, you play just one hand, or alternatively until one player has won two hands. In [company=396]AEG[/company]'s version you play until someone has won 7/5/4 rounds for 2/3/4 players, which makes for a much longer game and it evens out the luck more.

[b]Tiebreaker:[/b] There is no tiebreaker in the original [company=7552][/company] version, instead both players win. The rules suggest that you play again, either just with the tied players or everyone involved in the game. In [company=396]AEG[/company]'s version you count up the total amount of all cards played in the game, with the player with the higher total breaking the tie and winning the round. It is therefore important to play all your cards in front of yourself in their version, and the rules actually calls for playing them so all your discards are clearly visible - this makes card counting even easier.

[b]The Minister and Countess[/b] are both rank 7, but very different between the versions. [company=7552][/company]'s Minister loses the game (or round) if you are caught with it and a Princess, General, or Wizard in your hand (i.e. have a hand total of 12 or more). [company=396]AEG[/company]'s Countess only forces you to play her card if you also have the King or Prince in your hand. I prefer how [company=396]AEG[/company]'s Countess keeps you in the game, even though players now have a great shot at guessing your hand, while [company=7552][/company]'s original Minister just ends your turn and feels like it increases the game's luck factor.

[b]The Priestess and Handmaiden[/b] are both rank 4, but their special effects work slightly differently. [company=7552][/company]'s Priestess still allows its player to be targeted , but without effect. However, [company=396]AEG[/company]'s Handmaiden doesn't allow its player to be targeted at all, forcing you to target someone else (including yourself with the Prince if their is no other target). I definitely prefer the implementation of the Priestess to the Handmaiden.

2	4	Priestess	Handmaid
2	3	Knight		Baron

[b]The Princess:[/b] I love how [company=7552][/company]'s version of the game comes with two Princess cards with different art, and even a Prince, just to provide some variety and choice. Kudos!

[b]Card Quality:[/b] Both versions feature poker size cards. I think I prefer [company=7552][/company]'s rather stiff cards, compared to [company=396]AEG[/company]'s cards, while the latter does allow for riffle shuffling, they also get marked up a lot easier, something made worsse by the full color picture of the princess on their backs. Given how important it is for the cards to remain unmarked, you should definitely invest in some premium sleeves regardless of which version you get.


[b]tl;dr:[/b] In summary, I prefer [company=396]AEG[/company]'s version mainly due to how its Countess works compared to [company=7552][/company]'s Minister, rating the former a 10 and the latter a 9. The game is also much better played until someone wins a set number of rounds and with proper tiebreaker rules. I do really like the cute artwork in [company=7552][/company]'s original though, love the alternative Princess and Prince, and prefer the rules of their Priestess to [company=396]AEG[/company]'s Handmaiden.

I appreciate the clown car-ish amount of game contained in the box. However, I just don't like clowns no matter how many of them are in the car. 

Maybe it's the years of playing poker competitively but the decisions in this game were too easy to make for me. I never felt like I lost because of poor play. Usually it came down to poor draw or an unfortunate combination of moves in series that logically were good decisions by the individual players.

A decent filler but not in the quality category of Coloretto, For Sale or Piece O' Cake.  It may be possible to bluff a little... there are some opportunities for deduction... but a lot of blind guessing occurs which leads to quite a few rounds of dumb luck wins.  Still quick and fun and those plays where you do figure something out you feel like you've accomplished something.  I'd play again but have no desire to own this one.

When I first heard about this game, a couple of weeks before Spiel, I just ignored it. How could a game with only 16 cards and a couple of tokens, be interesting or at least fun? After Spiel, it seemed like almost everybody picked up a copy of this game. Well, everybody? At least dozens of players of a Dutch forum did. And they were hilarious about this game. I became interested again, but it seemed it was sold out completely. I decided to try to make a print & play copy, as I think the price of the game is too high for what you get.  I bumped along pictures of the 8 different cards there are into play, but I didn’t know the how many of each cards were in the game. I looked further, and suddenly, in the caverns of the Intern, I found it. Started up Photoshop, and created the cards for myself. I translated the text on the cards into Dutch, and printed out the cards on paper sheets. After that, I glued the cards onto cardboard, and created a cardbox. I believed it would be a fun, extra birthday gift for M. To accomplish this, I would have to work fast, as her birthday only last for a couple of hours this day. Luckily for me, she was visiting a soccer match. I managed to fabricate the game in a couple of hours, and I just wrapped it into paper, a couple of minutes before she arrived back home.

M. loved the gift, and we started playing, after I explained the rules to her in less then 1 minute. Basically it comes to this.

    Every player gets one card.
    Top card is out of the game (blind).
    A player takes a card.
    A player plays a card.
    The played card is performed.

Nothing more, nothing less. And it’s fun! Not a deep game at all. This game is about counting cards, bluffing, deduction and guessing. It’s easy to explain, and it plays fast. In a four player game, player who gets 4 tokens first, wins the game. A round will only take a couple of minutes. Or less. It’s possible (at least in a 2-player game it is), that a round is finished, after a player, played just 1 card. As said, this one is plain fun.

So.... here is my ORIGINAL 3/10 rating of the game:

While it's VERY short play time makes it more enjoyable than most ultra-random games, that's not saying much.  Every time we've tried to play this game, I feel like the game is playing me instead.  
First, your "hand" consists of one card only.  So, when you pick up a card and discard a card, you are faced with only 2 choices.  This wouldn't be so bad, but VERY often, you will have a combination of cards from which there IS only one choice.
The card interaction SHOULD be interesting, but when you are never in possession of more than two, and the point of the game dictates that you need to keep the *better* card, you'll always be choosing the lesser one (and if not, it is only because the other card forces you to discard the higher one - I can't remember if that happens in Love Letter or any of its mechanical brethren.  But, in essence, that's how the game always will play out). 
It's boring.  I'm not sure how this game became so popular.  Like other extreme random games, i'd rather just play blackjack.  Why try and change a style game that is already working?

Now, my revised review:

I decided to give this one another try.  I had a very dull day at work and I brought this game with me to see if it would pass the time with my co-worker.  As it happens, we actually had a fun time with it!  I was surprised!
it was still as random, and often as predetermined as when I had tried it before.  However, this time it worked some how....  I think it was mostly because we had a fun time making fun of the outcomes (we aren't too PC when it comes to... our work humor).  We'd swear and curse the cards in quite a vulgar way ("Dirty pervy priest", "whoring countess", "I can't believe your stupid dirty guard snuck into the princess' room!!!!  SUUUUUURE, delivering a letter - like i'd believe that bullshit!" etc).  Somehow, this actually made the game fun to us.  I do not actually think that you should add vulgarity to make a game fun, but - hey - if it makes you laugh and no one is being hurt doing so, I condone a certain crudeness among friends.  
I can't say that it is a game that will come out often.  I won't really recommend it.  But it was good for some laughs, so i'll give it that.

I really disliked Love Letter after my first couple (2P) plays.  When I played it 3 and 4 player I started to warm up to it...oh hey, there are some pretty cool card interactions and opportunities to stretch the logic muscles in my brain a little bit.  Now I flat out love it, you get an awful lot of value for the time investment.  In spite of the ridiculous theme, Love Letter is very very cool.

So far this is the best Player Elimination game I have ever played. Fast short burst of mini mind games with your friends is the best way to past the time. The mechanics is simple enough to teach to someone who isn't even listening. Heck you can even just play right away and tell them to play one and draw one. That's it. Simple mechanics and fast short burst of a game. Awesome.

Don't know how to rate this, really, but by some reason or another, me and my pal laughed our asses off while playing this for hours. Fast and furious, on 2 players I've a hard time knowing if there are any tactics, or if it's just a matter of flinging accusations and doing whatever you can with the cards you've got. At any rate, we had a blast.

Fun. My dad loves this game. Good for vacations. Might sell this one if I get the Batman edition.

Excellent game for a quick refresher; changes for the better after a series of games, gets even better (again) with a mix of experienced and new players. Very elegant little game... beautiful artwork.

Played it a ton on hollidays, super compact to bring and play anywhere, and super fast rounds make it so you dont care if you only have a few min to play

RATING: 7.5
Probably our favorite hidden identities game. Plays really quick, and there are few better feelings than guessing if your opponent has the Handmaiden/Shugenja before they can protect themselves on the first turn. Ahh the little things in life.

Amazing little card game.  A more pure distillation of a game, I've never seen.

Great filler game. Surprisingly deep for a card game with only 16 cards.

My partner & I both enjoy this game. Nothing we particular bring out all the time but! we have played this many times with our friends, & family of all age groups. Easy to learn, I would say this has a bit of luck factor... but not kidding one time we had a person win 4 matches in a row!

I'm giving this a 10 because it gives so much fun back compared with the tiny bit of time and money need to invest in it.

Man, those cards in the German ed. are big. Looks like somebody at Pegasus Spiele felt a need to reduce the amount of air in a given-size box.

short, sweet, and addicting.

UPDATE: on my second and third plays, I've been able to REALLY see what makes this game fun. A great game!

Short. Brutal. Psychological. And yet, somehow lacking. Too much feels out of player control.

Great game that gets better with more people. A bit of luck is needed but a person that pays attention has the highest chance of winning. There are definite giveaways at what each person has depending on how they play their hand. So, the better you are at remembering and deducing, the better you will be at this game.

RATING: 8
Interesting, quick, little filler. I like the art style, especially the female guards, and the game play is much deeper than you'd expect in such a simple little game. It's not my favorite filler, but it is a good one.

RATING: 7
Not something I would really set out to play, but it is a good filler game or something interesting if you need a game with minimal weight. Learning to play takes about as long as reading the cards.

A big surprise for us. In 2p, not really funny, but with 3p, it becomes loads of fun :) Minimalism in its best! But we bought a Kanai edition as well and the 7 card is different (and not working at all in Kanai).
Had to leave behind in Slovakia.

I've played this a few dozen times and I'm pretty sure despite what every fan says it's pretty much just random chance. Can you really read your opponent, or are you just making random guesses and laughing at the results?

it s a game of bluffing deduction card game - very fast and easy - everybody can play, and everybody must get and defend in this hand the princess if you want to give her the love letter!

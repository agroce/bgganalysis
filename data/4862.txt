I have the 2000 edition. One of the worst things about this game is that it definitely does not survive dating; each year it gets less and less relevant until it becomes unplayable. 

The actual game play is quite fun in most cases, but the irrelevancy of cards makes it difficult.

Ugh, I tend to hate playing party games, being that I like the odd and abstract.  This game turns me off to party games totally.  It isn't bad the first two or three times playing, but once you start playing it five or six times in one weekend, it gets old.  I will probably want to play it again, but it will take some time to get it out of my system.

Every time my family tried to play this game, we ended up getting in horrible arguments.  I can't remember any other game growing up which had quite as much negativity surrounding it in terms of family fights!  I can still remember my brother saying, "I DID say 'Lion,' dammit!" and that's just one of the milder "outbursts" which would ensue.  What's funny is that we'd put it up for a year or two, then get it out at the next family Christmas gathering, thinking "Ok, this time will be different and we won't act like a bunch of babies"--and 10 minutes later someone would be storming out of the room again!  And then fast forward a decade or so later, I've got a family of my own now.  And my wife and I end up in a huge argument while trying to play Outburst.  By the way, clean the wax out of your effing ears.  I SAID Jefferson!

Bought it for $.250 at a  garage sale. Isn't worth much more. Not a complete loss or waste of time, but not far off. It's a party game of sorts, but our players just kind of ummed and ahed at some of the categories and it probably works better in much larger party type groups I'd guess (we played with 6).

This is a party game of guessing words on a list. Overall it is quite cleverly done and unlike some party style games plays well with as few as four players. I am thinking it might even work with two. It gets pretty loud with more players so this might be an issue for some people. A party game for small parties?

This is a good game for big groups. There aren't many you can play with 20 people, but this one shines with large groups of people (two teams). It's great in the rule book where it states something to the effect that "these ten choices are ours and if you don't like them too bad.".

The set I have is in a green box, latest copyright year 1994.

My big complaint about this game is that it's highly generation-dependent.  Many cards don't work for younger players since the themes are older, and unfortunately many of us are not Barry Manilow fans.  When I played this, we didn't use the rules and instead picked out reasonable cards for the opposing team.

Nice enough party game.
If it were anything but a light party game, it would really suck that the team that starts has a huge advantage and the game makes no effort whatsoever to balance it. But even in this genre, it would be better to rule that every team has the same number of active turns at the end.

Great party game.  Sort of like Family Feud without getting kissed by Richard Dawson.  A game I remember from my teen-age years.  In 2007, my best friend when I was a child, his father passed away from brain cancer (sudden diagnosis).  I always remember him playing games with our two families (his parents were good friends of my parents from church).  I think he would have liked this website.  I remember playing the original Outburst! with him when we were in High School, and I can still see him reading us the funny rules for the first time "This Game is Unfair!...Toooo Bad!"

Main problem of the game is that it needs re-editing from time to time, as some questions refer to popular culture and are outdated after a few years or so.

I freaking love Outburst! This is always one of my go to games. however, there is a couple problems with this game.  1st, with it being 2001 its already pretty outdated, and for this to be successful, it really is one of the few games where newer really is better.  2nd, there is this problem with regional products. Im from the Midwest, so a lot of times Ive never heard of certain things. 3rd, there's ALWAYS a ringer!! DAMN you number 10!! ugh...lastly, my hubby doesn't like this one, for whatever reason. He will throw me a bone every once in a while and let me play, but he really doesn't like it, so its a little like pulling teeth.

Lowered my rating from a 5 to a 4.  It really isn't something I'd end up playing, especially as I've gotten my parents into newer, deeper, and more fun games.

When I was younger, and we had family over, we'd often play this as a larger party game.  It was fun, and I have fond memories of everyone playing and shouting out answers, but nowadays it seems a little lacking.

Given the proper situation, I'd probably play it, but I would be hard pressed to bring up playing this specifically, especially within my usual game group.

I dislike being forced to come up with things in a category where there are lots of possible and equally correct things but no, you have to have the same ones on the card. It's frustrating.

I own the electronic version and I think it's the best.  You don't need that stupid red screen, don't need the board to keep score.  The electronic version does have this weird "challenge" type rule where if you are behind you can bid on how many you think your team will get right, and if you are wrong you lose those points, but it has never worked out to be succesful because the other team who is ahead doesn't want to risk it, and there is no incentive to (unless I've been playing wrong for a few years).  Overall a really fun game.

For me this is just painful. Though, I could see where it might be mildly occasionally amusing for those who know a lot of trivia.

I don't know if it is marketed as such but it is really a trivia game where knowledge of various random subjects is required to have a chance at participating. If you do know something about the question in a given round then it becomes a game about guessing as many of the 10 ‘answers’ as you can in a set time limit. Otherwise it is a game of waiting for the time to expire...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This one is a real classic! In my book it's the best ever party game and among the best board games ever.

Play it with at least 10 players and you'll feel like you're in a game show or something. It is fast-rate, thrilling, tantalizing, loads of interaction, pure fun!

The sole downside is that you memorize the cards by and by and some of the topics have become a bit outdated up to now. I do hope they'll bring out an expansion some day.  

Please don't rate it if you haven't played it with at least 10 players yet. Remember it's a party game, so give it a try.

A big pro is that it's not just my favorite game of mine but also of my wife.

This game is a family tradition!  When I get together with my mom's side, it's only a matter of time before this comes out.  We always do men v women, and REALLY give each other a hard time about answers.  "You said 'vacuum', but the card says 'SHOP vac...'"  haha  We have to warn people when they play with us for the first time.  It's always a lot of fun!

Update 05-28-2013 - Decided to be honest with myself and remove the 10 status.  Down to a 6.

I am looking fo a version of this that is not listed here but thought I would take a chance.  I am looking for the Electronic Outburst Platinum Edition (the Electronic Taboo Platinum Edition too).  I bought one about a year ago for $10 and cannot find it again.  I find it online all over and on ebay for $40 and $50.  I want one for my nephews for Christmas and I really do not want to spend more than about $15.  If someone has one or can tell me where to get one I would be forever grateful.  kaprecup@comcast.net

Okay... this one deserves some explanation. It's not a bad idea for a "party game" and we had some fun with it back in the day -- you know, before Catan hit the states. When we lived in a small town in Alabama, we had a blowout for the 4th of July one year, inviting all of our RPG friends and all of our neighbors. As happens in Alabama, we got one of those sudden thunderstorms of bullet rain that made us all run for cover. There were about twenty people crowded into our small family room, so we brought out Outburst and divided into teams.

The next day, my straight laced neighbor of about thirty years old said, "Thanks for having that party last night. That was a good idea to play that parlor game."

My parents were old enough to remember the Depression and I'd never heard the term "parlor game" in my life.

RATING: 5
A party game. Dated. Yet, strangely compelling. The answers are oddly-fun to explore. 

During the one session we played with several people - two teams. There is a bit of chaos as one team is shouting answers at the other and the other team is trying to compare those answers given to the answers supplied. 

The game breaks down a bit as this process is a mess with more than a handful of people on a side. You get, (well we had ) situations where an answer is revealed and the other team claims they gave the answer. Fair enough. This opens the game to gamesmanship which is ugly in what is ostensibly a pary game. 

So, that being said, the game was fun when had a go it in the following way: One person reads the category and a few people try to get all 10 responses. No timer, no points, just fun going through the answers and brain-wracking to try to get all 10.

01/26/2013: This is a fun, party/family game.  Our copy is from the early 1990s and has gotten plenty of table time over the years.  It's a little like Family Feud where you have to guess as many of the 10 provided answers to a category as possible.  Any number of players can play as two teams.  There are lots of categories/cards so it can be replayed many times.  However, our edition is old enough that we have to think of answers that could only have occurred before 1994.  That adds a little challenge for us to some of the categories.  A solid party game for any collection.

Combining a trivia game with a game where everyone is shouting out answers all at once.  Yuck!.  The very nature of this game can make it difficult for someone to actually keep up with everything that is being said, which can lead to issues for the really competitive.  Of course, being essentially a trivia game is a mark against it in my book anyway.  Still, at its heart, this really seems to be a more modern version of the very old Family Feud. [08/14/2007]

RATING: 7.7
Components - .9/1 There's a timer, cards, a few dice, and a half dozen plastic pass tokens. The only knock is the cards feel sort of cheap, but overall they hold up as much as they need to.

Fun - .8/1 We tend to have fun with this game because we don't take it too seriously. As the rules say, most of the game really does have to be an on your honor sort of thing. If playing with the strictest people, it gets old fast.

Replayability - .8/1 A fairly decent double sided card collection that the game offers a fair amount of plays. The biggest problem is that the game is 30 years old, so the knowledge needed is getting more an more forgotten from general memory.

Strategic - .7/1 Sort of trivia, except you simply need to know things that are related to the topic. Your recollection for the most part drives how well you do. That being said, there are a wide range of categories so it is possible you simply get all the "hard" categories versus someone who gets all the "easy" categories. There is some luck mitigation in that you have a few "passes" that make the other team play the category, and you have to decide whether or not playing a category is better than giving it to your opponent(s).

Theme - 0/1 None to speak of.


Personal Rating - 3.5/5 A pretty good filler type game. It's best numbers are probably in the 6-8 range to allow for enough minds to come up with thing, but not too many that it becomes impossible to track all the answers stated. The game's biggest hurdle is that it's 30 years old (at the time of this writing) and so some of the categories are pretty difficult (e.g. can you name prominent US religious leaders of 30 years ago?) The fact that the game has a means for luck mitigation is awesome and is pretty well balanced (3 tokens seems to work out as a good amount, you can pass most of the really bad ones, but can't simply pass everything that you may not know a majority).

Just doesn't seem like that clever of a game concept and, since I don't enjoy party games all that much, not that enjoyable a gaming experience either.

One of the party games that I always enjoyed, more an association than a trivia game. I was always happy to play this in groups, with us it had a tradition to come out on new year's parties for some reason.
Playing with older editions can add a complicated edge though as in being asked for things like politicians or music acts it can be hard to recollect what the big names 10 or 20 years ago were, lol.

An alright party game with a "Family Feud" style gameplay (guess 10 answers in a given category). Can sometimes be frustrated with the answers that are/aren't included but otherwise ok.

Prone to dated and obscure topics, like any game of its type. But the basic format of many right answers to each question is a good one to keep the energy up and the stress down, which are key for party games. Not so bad as party games go.

This is a pretty inoffensive party game and can be amusing, but there is a wide range in difficulty of each set, and you are subject to the whims of the designers who think that boxers and chihuahuas are among the 10 meanest dog breeds, and even more irritatingly, that the "Battle of the Sexes" is one of the 10 great American battles.

There are many party games I'd rather play, but it's not bad, by any stretch of the imagination.  The first edition is really showing its age, similar to [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2952]Genus I Trivial Pursuit[/url].  Some of the answers are pretty out there.  It's like Family Feud, adapted for parties and more frenetic.  Card draws can sometimes suck the life out of the game.  Hmm, you got "Things You Find in a Toolbox" and I got "Supreme Court Justices, 1966-1986."

Semi-clever, but the cards become outdated quickly. Plus some of the hints are so vague they almost always illict a "Well thats stupid" when the answers are revealed.

There are surely better party games around. The concept could be at least decent, but unfortunately many of the categories are "broken", because there are too many correct answers than the ones listed on the card (and the listed ones are not even the most obvious). Disappointing.

Could be redeemed by using the same mechanics with "home-made" categories. Probably too much effort anyway.

Let me give you a real life example of how I feel about this game. Once we had a turn where our card was "Fashion Designers". We might have gotten 1 name before the time ran out. The next team had a card that said "Planets". They obviously got the 9. The tenth one listed was "Krypton".

There are worse party games, but there are better ones too.

A party game where teams try to guess every answer on the card similar to the game show Family Feud. Can be fun once in a blue moon, but because it doesn't bring anything new or interesting to the table with the guessing the novelty doesn't last long.

Eines der wenigen Party- oder Kommunikationsspiele, das zu zweit genauso viel Spaß macht wie zu mehreren. Spielt sich wie Familienduell, man muss 10 vorgegebene Begriffe zu einem Thema erraten. Schade, dass es keine Zusatz-Kartenpakete gibt, es sollte mal eine Neuauflage geben.

Not a bad party game. The game has lots of different categories, and more importantly most of them are at least somewhat interesting.

I really enjoy the Ares Project Designer's take on the RTS to boardgame conversion.  I think it is simple enough to learn easily while giving a sense of that style game on a tabletop.

Inspired by real-time strategy video games, Ares Project has players building armies and buildings in secret, then deploying them into combat.

The four factions are substantially different from each other, and much of the game play is done behind a shield so all players have to be very familiar with some rather intricate rules that may only apply to their army.

Once you get over that hump there's a clever and evocative game. I particularly like the giant robot. Also, Mars.

comment after 1st game: 
looks like a good game but needs further plays. I like how you build up your base and forces. It has also a smooth flow to it. BUT: Starcraft the Boardgame will probably be the better Starcraft simulation, playing with more than 2 players can be brutal and lead to quick player elimination or ganging-up and lastly, the artwork is really, rally bad.

Ares Project doesn't really get a lot of recognition and I can kind of see why: apparently there was a whole release schedule debacle and the graphic design is...iffy at best. However, I promise that if you want a heavily strategic duel, Ares Project cannot be beaten for the price.

I paid just around $13 for this diamond in the rough and immediately wrote it off as a loss. Just look at the components: drab, lazy graphical designs from someone who clearly has never done this before on frankly cheap feeling pieces.

However, once you peer under the hood, this game has a lot of really nice streamlining for the clear StarCraft homage that it is.

The main idea is that it mimics RTS play. Specifically StarCraft as the NOT!Protoss, NOT!Zerg, and ...ACTUAL!Terrans make their appearance in the game with the same mechanical play styles. Plus one badass Colossus faction that's completely original (and my personal favorite aspect of the whole game). This game tends to assume both players have equal APM and jumps straight into making balls, deciding what buildings to...build, and how to use resources (again, assuming both players are equally competent at econ and APM). If these terms make no sense for you, then rest assured the RTS-geared part of the review is over.

Each faction plays wildly differently from the others, to the point that we had to let each other know which rules were being broken explicitly. That's fantastic and really makes it like you can play a completely different game each time. Truly, for each unique matchup there is a uniquely different game being played. This is so superbly done that I have basically zero suggestions for improving this factor. Get another core set so you can mirror match? Expansions?

The actual gameplay is where the meat resides. You start by CHOOSING (!!!) 2 cards for you hand, ANY cards, plus a standard attack. This makes so many unique combo openings that I can't even think straight. Each turn, you and an opponent secretly play a card then draw back to 3. Cards are either played face-up for their effects (like a building or upgrade) but secretly behind your screen OR facedown as sort of build points (resources) onto a location where you need them. This rapidly goes back and forth 1 card at a time at breakneck speed until someone plays an attack (SECRETLY, as some have special abilities) and selects an attack type. The type determines how long and how deadly that fight can be, much like choosing to attack an opponent's expansion installations or home base in an RTS, based on where you are. And indeed, controlling the middle (frontier) is also a factor, just like in RTS.

During combat, you arrange the cards where your units will poop out of into a line. Players take turns doing this (first mover disadvantage) to either side, trying to match up optimal numbers against the opponent. Your resources have been converted into units based on their costs, and now you roll some d6s in initiative order to determine hits. Each unit also has a particular rating against each other unit's defensive typing (Infantry, Armored, Airborne, Building) sort of like Supreme Commander.

Ultimately, the combat could be a bit faster but otherwise the game plays extremely smoothly. There's always this tension as you wonder if you have time to spend 4 more resources making a powerful unit that will stomp the opponent, or if you should use the last of a certain unit type as a resource since you know you can't draw it again, thus not having it as a counter. There's so many mindgames. My opponent just rushed an early air raid against my home base. Do I counter with anti-air base defense, anti-air units and take the frontier, or assume they will decommission those units and try to predict they went for heavy tanky units?

Eventually, either the player's decks run out (surprisingly fast) or someone's home base has everything obliterated. At the point the decks are out, every attack you scored while controlling the frontier gives you a point and most points win. Home base destroyed? Lose. This means if your opponent just dominates the frontier easily, you can desperately spam at their home base until they relent and give up the frontier, allowing you to score a bit before coming back at you. There are SO many strategies just for how to get ahead, stay ahead, or come back in the game, let alone what units to build, what precious resources to give up, and when to attack.

Ares Project is an amazing and richly deep strategy game. Its biggest downfall are threefold:

-The components feel extremely cheap. They are actually NOT cheap. After playing a lot and assuming the cards were gross greycore trash with cheap laminate coating them, we found a few that had less coating (factory error?) and they bent more like ivory-core or blue-core. Not bad quality actually. The die-cut chits were fine and didn't tear like ones from Fantasy Flight. The player boards were sturdy. It seriously needs a graphical makeover, I say this as an artist.

-The game is a bit huge to get into. Remember how I said it was deep, involved, and everything plays differently, even breaking tons of rules? Yeah, that makes it really hard to learn and teach. You really need friends who are going to dive deep into this game as a half-committed opponent just isn't fun.

-The dice make this game so frustrating to me. It can sort of be mitigated by superior tactics but that's really no excuse once your opponent is a good match. I wish there was a way to fix the dice combat because while not particularly bad, it does open a lot of room for un-Starcraft-like experiences.

If you want to play the board game equivalent of Supreme Commander Star Craft, GET THIS GAME.

Update: After 10 plays, I can tell I'm never going to get tired of this game. It's just so heady and strategic. It would take months or years of solid play to plumb its depths completely.

The attack mechanic needs work, but the transition between build-up and battles is exciting. The battles themselves aren't well done. They're too random, too punishing and not tactically interesting. It has a huge runaway leader problem. Deep strikes are badly designed. I played the Zergs and found 50% of their cards useless. Too luck dependent for example:

 - You may try to assemble a quick force, but are not allowed to attack, because you don't have the correct attack card.
 - You don't draw a counter to your enemies units.

Overall a bad design, that had some interesting ideas. When you secretly build up your force to strike, there's a great excitement. Will it work? Will you fail? The designer should have done better!

RATING: 7.5
Es un juego de combate y conquista, basado en cartas. Admite dos modalidades de juego: básico y avanzado. De momento solo conozco el básico.

El jugador tiene un mazo de cartas, y una mano de tres cartas. En su turno, lo único que tiene que hacer es jugar una carta. Se puede jugar bocaarriba (se construye un edificio), o bocaabajo sobre un edificio (para generar unidades) o una carta de ataque.

Hay dos terrenos: la frontera y la base enemiga. Cuando un jugador proclama un ataque debe decir a qué zona va atacar y el defensor determina qué zona va a defender. 

Quien posee la frontera se queda con las cartas rojas que se jueguen. El juego termina cuando un jugador agota su mazo, o cuando la base del enemigo es conquistada.

Es sencillo (el módo básico) y sobre todo, muy rápido... antes de que te des cuenta, te vuelve a tocar el turno.  Así con todo, hay suficiente chicha para planificar y darle un poco al coco. 

Los combates se resuelven con tiradas de dados. Hay tema de iniciativas y tiene especial importancia la colocación de las cartas con unidades. 

Es un juego interesante.

Haven't played yet and already a fan! At this point I have played the game, and I am going to support the expansions for two new races the designer of the game confided with me that he had planned, but could not fulfill because the game didn't sell well enough for the publishers to be interested. When my future game company is established, I will support and help this design team of father and son to create and sell their expansions, under my company's name, because it is a good game as far as I am concerned, and should be allowed the chance to reach its design potential, even with the possiblity of loss.

This game had a lot of promise, but it just fell flat. There are some interesting decisions to be made when constructing your army and base, but it goes by fast, and then you are in combat for WAY TOO LONG. Because the combat system is both tedious and highly luck-based, this is a huge problem. Since I grew up on StarCraft, I wanted to like this game, but I just don't.

WOW--what to say about this game other than EPIC! A tight design where every turn is important.  Although there are dice, there are enough rolls each game that the averages play out and battles tend to be very balanced and with memorable ebb and flow. Asymmetric sides thoroughly tested, each with their own feel, create thematic match-ups with great moments. Production issues (poor card quality, undersized screens) and mediocre graphic design take away only a bit from an otherwise brilliant effort.  This game is seriously that good.  Again--WOW!

*** Mar2014 Update: I still really love this game, and it does reward repeated play.  The game is not intuitive at times, and combat is a little tricky for the uninitiated.    Still, you should be able to pick this one up on a bargain.  If you invest the time to learn the game, you really won't be sorry.

It's hard to describe the awesomeness of the game until you play all of them. All of those hype, and this game actually exceeds it. It manages to capture most of the feeling playing RTS (particularly Starcraft) without actually making it real time game. 

Not only that, the asymmetry is delicious. All of the factions have a very distinct play style, and each of them can be played one way or another, depends on your strategy. And this game does reward skill and experience. There's lot of decision coming from your limited handsize, dual use nature of the cards, and to resource or not to resource. 

If I may nitpick is the only need of screens. It simulates fog of war quite good, and I have no other solutions, but it's not cheater-proof. I don't play with cheater, but the idea of the possibility is bugging me a little.

I have a number of issues with the game.  First, the rules are too heavy and poorly organized for a game of this length. Secondly, I feel this really shines when you have a dedicated opponent to put in enough time to explore the games depth.  I also thought the graphic design of the game was a little poor. This is too many issues for me when I have a number of awesome two-player games I love.  If you ever wanted Starcraft the card game and have a regular opponent, this could be the one for you.

Ultimately, I had a high rating for AP that fell somewhat quickly (18 games).  

The initial problem is that I played the Kahoum alot, and our group is now convinced that the Kahoum are quite a bit weaker than all the other factions.  So, I was irritated from losing alot, and we are left with only 3 races to play instead of 4.

I think the Kahoum problem is related to two points:

#1 = flanking is a key combat advantage and the power requirements are such that Kahoum will pretty much always be outnumbered and lose any battle of attrition.

#2 = obelisks don't work in raids, so everyone will kick Kahoum in a raid, and Kahoum can't raid.  This is a 3-6 card shift in a game and that is decisive.

The other races are okay and it is fun for awhile, but I think each game comes down to some rock/papers/scissor decisions that when you are wrong, the only salvation is the dice.  The game is a tad too long, fiddly, and repetitious for that dynamic.

Feels perhaps wonky, but is very enjoyable and moves at an excellent clip. It's fun to build up units and them smash them against someone, and the upgrades in conjunction with different unit types offer lots of choices without overwhelming you with unit customization. 
The rules have a little more grit than I'd like, though.

[EDIT] Sadly, some bad early battle results (read: rolls) can really put you in a hole. This is a problem.

Too much comes down to who wins the dice battles early. A very lopsided (due to luck) early battle can really screw you over heavily. A lopsided end-game battle can nullify your dominating lead all game by simply eliminating you.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2017)

The Ares Project was one of my oldest unplayed games. I bought it on early 2014, I finally played it this month and I can say, it appeared a fascinating game at first, but it ended up boring me. 

The rules aren’t as easy to learn from the rulebook (it could be much better), but once you understand them, you can teach them under 12 minutes. That’s for the basic game only, I didn’t read nor tried to play the advanced game. For the full game, I guess you would need at least 25 minutes to teach everything. Playtime is more than 75 minutes.

The Ares Project theme is neat, we are terraforming mars :D, I like the theme and it did it before Mars became a cool theme. 

The game´s component are regular as is the art.

The game seemed fascinating at first. Players have a shield to keep hidden their movements, that makes easy to cheat by mistake or with intention. You have many options each turn, but the game wasn’t as fun as I had hoped. Players develop their infrastructure until one of them attacks the middle terrain or the opponent’s base. It sounds great on paper, but it is a boring game in practice. I also dislike that you need to roll low to succeed (this is a personal pet peeve, I always like to roll high). In general, the game is very repetitive and it doesn’t offer a lot of fun.

The luck factor is very high. In theory you can control it as you know the odds, but in our game, my opponent should have won, he rolled 6 dice at least 4 times and he needed a 1 to win but he never rolled it. The cards themselves also have a lot of luck of the draw, if you don’t draw an attack card you cannot attack.. I feel the luck factor is high.

The battles can be long and procedural and you don’t have interesting decisions in it.

As I wrote before, I played only the basic game, each faction has its rulebook and each one is different from each other. 

Best with two players.

Bottom line, The Ares Project is a novel and interesting game, but still I found it to be very boring and repetitive. I only played the basic game, but I didn’t like it enough to explore the advanced mode. It seems the advanced mode offers much more depth, but my desire to play it again is very low. It has a lot of luck. I already sold my copy of the game. I feel it is a cool idea, but the execution is boring.

I've only played the full game a couple of times and then only with the two factions suggested for the Basic game.

The games have been fun. The direct conflict is quite bearable. There is a lot of clever stuff in this game. Far too much to talk about here. I like the strategic options offered, the psychological warfare, and the unique abilities of the different factions. I don't like how much commitment is needed to even graze the surface of this game. It is very hard to find playing partners. It seems destined to the pile of 2p games that I wish I had the right playing partner for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Innovative mechanics. But ultimately, the choices (esp. dice outcomes) feel too discrete. Battles tend to be game deciding -- a major loss (which can be determined by a few lucky hits) is irrecoverable. The one card/turn, while simple, doesn't give much room for recovery or changing tactics.

In contrast, Eclipse, for example, gives a lot more ways to build up and counter technologies. The engagements feel more controlled -- you know what you are likely getting into. I'm not quite sure why Eclipse feels different, but it feels less like one engagement is a make or break. I want to like this game, and will probably give it a few more plays, but not seeing it yet despite the innovation.

RATING: 5
This rating is only for the base (beginner) game.  I believe I would raise the rating for the expert game, but I'm not sure there will be many opportunities to play the expert game.  Ideally, each person builds up his or her forces in secret and then make a decision which target to attack and the defender also guesses which determines initiative.  This game is pretty much advanced rock, paper, scissors with units that take out other units more efficiently, etc.

* Components
- The (new) cards have their backs already visibly damaged, with white cardboard showing under the black border.
- Most of the counters were quite hard to punch.  However, they are nicely centered.
- The counter drawings are quite bland and uninspiring.  The colors are muted.
+ The box is of good quality: sturdy enough, with a good printing quality.
+ The player mats are thick, with a nice glossy finish.

* Rules
- The rules are not presented in the best way possible. For example, the Reorganization step (p. 8) indicates that unengaged force may be moved, explains at length how to do it… It turns out that unengaged forces remain unengaged, and you finally learn that if both players have unengaged units, then they are all removed… Wait!? But you just explained how to reposition these forces, just to tell me now that actually I can remove them all from the battle line???! Strange.

I had a similar problem with the "take an unoccupied frontier" part, on p. 5: "If the Frontier is neutral the only way the other player can be attacked is by Deep Strike." followed immediately by "If the Attacker is not taking a neutral frontier, he secretly chooses between two Combat Choice cards: Normal Attack and Deep Strike." So… if I'm not taking the neutral frontier, I can choose? NO! (Later, the FAQ explain that a deep strike/raid *has* to be chosen if the neutral frontier is not taken.)

Another example: I can't find in the rules what winning a battle means. I can guess that it simply means wiping out all the enemy forces… or also destroying buildings that were emptied? I also guess that retreating does not imply losing the battle. It would be convenient if these points were spelled out explicitly.

The rules could (locally) be clearer; they are unnecessarily strangely formulated, in some places.

RATING: 6
This one is a real head-scratcher. I don't know what to make of it. In a way it's kind of like Neuroshima Hex: Das Kartenspiel, but that's not really too accurate. We played with the advanced (regular) rules, which was probably a mistake, as the besic construction and combat rules present in the starter game are wonky enough without adding the other layers. It also was a bad move because they really do mean "advanced". I was playing the Space Wizards and there's a lot to consider and manage that is very hard to do if you've never played at all before. Still, there's something there, and while I feel that exploring it further is going to result in a game that's not really my thing, I'd like to see more.

There's a lot of rules overhead to get through before you can really get into the full game -- particularly for the non-default factions (Zerg, Giant Robot) that have some very different fundamentals.

This game works best with a regular opponent and multiple plays. If you're the sort of gamer who rotates through games regularly and might play something once every three months, even if you've got a regular opponent who'd be interested, this is probably good to pass on.

BLUFFING.  A very nice adaption of an RTS computer game, but if you're not familiar with the RTS genre then some of the concepts may not make sense.

A fine concept and a decently set-up game, with good asymmetry, and decent mechanics. Gameplay is a little strange at first. It'll be a quick go-go-go of players placing cards behind their screen and drawing cards. I like the amount of info on the cards, the game packs in a lot of stats and affords a lot of flexibility. But you are held hostage to serious randomness in the game as to what cards come up. This isn't too bad except for the attack cards. You can't attack till you get a card and so you're subject to either; waiting, waiting, waiting to be able to attack or your opponent draws two attack cards close in time to you taking a beating and could not replenish your forces. I feel the attack cards or attack option should be detached from the resource deck. Nonetheless, there is a decent amount of strategy involved. Almost feels like a light tatbletop wargame.

I'm concerned about the double-luck between card draw and dice rolls.  Might be balance issues, but I don't have enough experience to know.

This game would take some exploration of available units, techs, etc. to know which combos work well.  Not sure I want to put in the time.

It plays fairly quickly with 2 which makes for a nice lunch game.

This starts out dull and conveluted with the basic game.  Once you get it under control, it's remarkably enjoyable, quick, and tense with the full game.  

Recommendations: get a couple copies of a good reference sheet.  This eliminates all the interuptions to the game flow by constantly looking up nuances.  I've spent a long time making one, and it easily cut game time in half, decreased frustration, and decreased learning curve.  I play with a slower gamer, and in 2 days we were on the full game, playing it in under half the printed game length (many games with him is over double printed game length).  I had tried to play with other friends before without this, and we could never get beyond the basic game with all the rules-re-checking we had to do.  But I tell you, with a good reference sheet, this game flies, and I am loving it far more than expected (and I had high expectations).  If you can find someone to learn this with over multiple plays, DO IT!!!!

Primarily a two-person game though it will play four.  A tabletop version of a real time strategy game, very much like a Starcraft.

Just tried the basic game.  It was OK, but it didn't really draw me in.  I think the big thing that is missing is theme.  There is very minimalistic art work on the cards, and many icons.  I'd try it again, but it's not a game I would consider buying.

A game that tries to capture a RTS game in a very streamlined way, but ends up being less than the sum of its parts. First off, the graphic design is possibly the worst I've ever seen. This game is really, really ugly, and the symbolism is borderline worthless. While this game tries to capture the feel of a RTS, it ends up being more like a game akin to Summoner Wars with hidden unit deployment. The factions all feel very different, which is a plus, but the game itself was a major disappointment for me.

Would rather play Nexus Ops.

The Ares Project is the most notable example of a game based on RTS principles, but I had not realized the background behind it. It's basically what StarCraft: The Board Game should have been, but wasn't. We played it once, and it was a learning game for both of us, and despite it arguably being right up my alley, I didn't really enjoy it all that much. It does emit a good RTS vibe, though. In that respect, I consider it a successful game. Not sure why it didn't click for me, but it may be due to the lack of map (and map control elements). A lot of RTS strategy comes down to how you play on the map.

I am torn between wanting to give it another try and giving up on it. Anyway, I gave it back to my buddy.

A gamer's game!  STEEP learning curve, but WORTH IT. In-your-face, King-of-the-hill, Put-up-your-dukes, Lock-n-load COMBAT!!  Many people might be put off by the many intracies of each of the 4 factions. I'm sure the Englesteins have put in triple overtime to get this game just right in smooth gameplay, assymetrical balance, overall feel, and tremendous fun! There are still many textual errors being discovered, BUT this game is still worth it.  To have a Queen Xenos unveil her wares against a fully stocked Colossus Robot. Or to have the Kahoum mentally outmaneuver a Terran army. Nukes! Swarms! Psychic abilities! Missles! Deep strikes! Each faction gets easier to play via intuition, but it'll take many plays to really know the strengths.

Great artwork! Much theme, reflecting one of the greatest video games of all time! Also, the designers really care about this game, and are actively in the forums, respectfully answering questions, and receiving feedback with grace!

The gameplay reminds me of L5R.

Not terrible, but Starcraft does this better. This game is more random and there's less sense of being able to mess with players in ways other than combat.

(3 plays)  We played the introductory game once, then jumped into the advanced game with the same two introductory factions.  Next we played the advanced game with the two other factions, so I've played this 3 times as a two player game.

There's a really interesting and fun game here, and I think with 3 or 4 players, it would shine more.  The frontier is a little obvious with 2 players, and that third player would really help balance that out.  It strikes me this could be a really great 3 player game... but we didn't do that.

However, the game has a STEEP learning curve.  Our first 3 games were VERY slow, and it seems clear that it would take a half dozen plays with each faction to catch onto their best cardplay interactions.

If you're looking for a meaty 3 player game that you plan to dig in and play a dozen or dozens of times - this may be your game - but for me, I'll probably end up picking something a little simpler with some cool miniatures.

Rulebook was way too complicated. We tried to give it a go, but could just not get through to every faction. After a few games, we didn't enjoy the game play enough to stick to it and experience all the advanced factions. It honestly didn't even feel very strategic - was not an intellectually challenging game, but more of a complicated mess  of cards and tokens. It's too bad though, the description sounded fantastic.

Had a few plays of the base game with a number of other players.  Certainly hope to move beyond that soon and try out the different factions.  Even only playing the base game, I have found that pre-emptive attempts to take the other player's base are generally doomed to failure and can result in wholesale annihilation.  Knowing when to stand and fight and when to retreat are imperative, with control of the frontier being key.  A very elegant game, especially considering it being a design debut.

Too random and you lack sufficient control. The battles, especially ones with cheap units, are too high variance.

Great abstraction of an RTS video game!

 - Each player builds in secret, so you need to attack in order to see what they're building.
 - The combat system, reminiscent of the Starcraft board game, shows off the RTS rock-paper-scissors model, with scouting points enabling you to obtain more favorable match-ups.
 - Surprise attacks are modeled via simultaneous action selection, and also help the loser catch up.

Ultimately, it abstracts away the things I don't care for (moving units around, clicking furiously), and distills it down to the actual strategic decisions you make in the game -- allocation of resources, power and workers, which buildings and units to go for, whether to rush or tech.

Simple base mechanism of play-1-draw-1, which is suitable since the fog of war would make cheating too accidentally easy if it were more complicated. But there is depth there too since you decide whether to play the card face-up as a new construction or face-down as a resource (reminiscent of Race for the Galaxy). Higher-tech buildings also require time, 'foundation' to construct, reminiscent of Glory to Rome, and show off the rush vs. tech extremes.

Heart of the game is in the combat system, which consists of matching units up in a CCG-like way. Different kinds of attacks can be pulled off too, so it's fine that the board is abstracted into my base, the battleground and your base.

And what game out there provides a mini-rulebook for each faction? The Terran-Protoss-Zerg + cool idea (Colossus) dynamic is conveyed through the card decks and innate abilities, with player differentiation everywhere.

Played 2 games so far, and both were a little short and degenerate due to lack of skill, but this has potential! Hopefully those games are a natural consequence of rushing, and there'll be more varied kinds (e.g. tech winning out over rush).

Original, ambitious, respectfully adapts/abstracts its setting, and in due time, hopefully very playable.

[u]Reminders[/u]

Terran has a worker-based economy where workers can be used to generate power, resources, 2 rerolls per, or militia defense. Balanced units. Power is generated by workers and power plants and used to build advanced units and weapons. Upgrade cards are Unit Technology (unit-specific, each Force can only hold 1) and Tech Facility (global). All Upgrade cards need power, but are built in the Tech space, so don't need to assign Unit Technology until Construction (but then it's permanent).

Kahoum has a worker-based economy where acolytes can be used to generate power, 1 reroll per or Novice defense. Units can be upgraded with power. Need power for buildings AND units and everything. Acolytes and Obelisks produce power (3). Upgrades are Obelisk Abilities that can only go on Obelisks (2 per). These are used in battle only if the Obelisk is voluntarily risked as a supporting unit that is placed last, and always in support. They can be protected by cheap Psi Walls. Emergency Defense can be used for 2 power instead.

Xenos produces (cheap, swarm, 6 per sometimes instead of 4, weak) units on Forces/buildings and generates power through Eggs. Resources played into the Queen space are Eggs and during Construction, they move to Larvae. Next time, the Larvae become New Adults, as units, or are sacrificed for power. 2 Larvae may be held over to provide flexibility. Eggs can be fast-tracked to New Adults through a power per 2 Eggs. Eggs go straight to New Adult during Emergency Defense. Upgrades are all played into the Gene Pool and assigned during Construction. Unlike Terran, only 1 general tech (Brain) allowed, but unlimited unit-specific techs (Genes) allowed, at a cost of 1 extra power per assigned tech. Genes once assigned are permanent. Most Genes allow units to 'Evolve' into a different type of unit (with chain-Evolves) for defense or sacrifice 1 attack type for another. The Queen can be risked in battle but if she is Wounded, eggs then cost 2 resources each (unless base is attacked).

Colossus Forces (weapons) do not have unit types. Where you build it on the Colossus determines what unit type it is. 2 slots for each type (except Building / Base Defense, which is built outside, and unaffected by Pilot, System Upgrades or anything naming 'weapon'), 2 slots for upgrades, 1 slot for Pilot (global tech). Upgrades can bleed into other weapon slots if needed. Lasers are normal, missiles disintegrate if you roll a 6 (i.e. they're kamikaze), guns provide units immediately upon construction (windfall world!), close combat allows maximum of 1 attack regardless of # of units. In every battle except a Raid, Empty Buildings on the Base Mat (but not Base Defense unless defending base) are at risk of destruction via the Chasis Cards, since the Colossus is a mobile base.

[hr]
In due time... it remained pretty unplayable. The combat system is inventive, but a total slog of calculation and icon-identification. Not a good sign for any game when I actually [i]dread[/i] battles and wish we could just hurry up and play cards to hasten the end. The dense information on cards and the awkward combat also means you're drowning in squares, circles and colors, and unable to appreciate the big picture, in which case I'd rather play a big game with figures. 

After playing a 'real' game with back-and-forth that threatened to go the distance (instead of just 15-min rush crush due to mistakes), projected playtime would have been 120-150 minutes. I could've fit a big-box game with figures into that timeframe, and the entire thing felt like a mechanical exercise instead of Starcraft. This game should be Starcraft, fast and furious, and having playtime extend over an hour for total abstraction is a killer.

A+ for ambition and originality, but this needed a lot more streamlining and development.

I'm still giving this 1 or 2 more shots. I'm very forgiving here, because 1) I sleeved the damn thing, 2) I like RTS, 3) the game is so innovative.

They didn't have a table for it at Essen and claimed that even explaining the battle mechanics would take half an hour, so demonstrating the game wouldn't make much sense. From what they told us, it sounded a lot like a table-top game, with battle mechanics similar to Axis and Allies. Just more complex. Basically each player has a base, and you try to get a proper surprise attack on that base, and destroy as much of it as you can. Then you play last-man-standing.

Approached this with the suspicion of dealing with an overly complex, enthusiastic but not too refined effort, and instead I found this gem of a game. I can't believe this was fun even solo (I know, how can I even think of playing this game solo? Oh well...) and in the very basic scenario! I can't wait to explore all the racial specials this has on offer (solo, as, as a side remark, I think the fiddliness factor is a bit too high for most of my current casual gaming opponents).

[i]Mistranslation of Starcraft into Board Game Form, but Cool Ideas for Factions[/i]

Kinda like a mix between Neuroshima Hex and Starcraft: The Board game, with the unique thing being a cool blind building system.

Really cool concept, but sadly I fear that this game is neither fun enough to be a fast-paced skirmish, or deep enough to be taken seriously as a strategy game 

As a proof of concept though, the hidden screen approach seems to be a legit way to convey that RTS fog of war. Other than that, though, there isn't much to make it feel like an RTS in my opinion. It's abstracted, the concept of economy expansion most of all with only one central area you can take over, don't seem to be able to increase production, etc., so you're just doing the same one thing per turn for a long time and hoping to have an advantage over your opponent in one of the key unit types

If there were more control over the strategy and the battles in the game, and more strategic options that you don't just fall into, then this would be an amazing game. But for that to work, the developers would have to do a lot of work on balancing -- it's much easier to just "randomize" the whole experience so you don't have to worry too mcuh about balancing or designing the game past the original idea -- just let the card draws, awkwardly selected strategies, and dice rolls (especially the dice rolls) decide what happens.

The mechanics for the diff races seem cool.

Overall this game seems like some sort of alpha-prototype concept, heavily in need of development and refinement

RATING: 5
This is an abstracted war game, or as a lot of people have taken to referring to it, an abstracted RTS game.  Each player chooses a faction and plays cards from that faction's deck in alternating turns until someone plays a battle card.  The cards played can either be buildings that produce units or resources that are spent to create units on these buildings by playing any card face down.

The battles in the game are pretty simple affairs.  Players take turns lining up units against each other then each unit acts in initiative order by rolling dice and adding adjustments for their capability against certain unit types, their distance to the unit, etc. to determine hits.  This is done in service to either conquering the central frontier area which provides points to the controlling player or to conquer the opponents base which results in an immediate win.

Each faction has different special powers and deck of cards with unique units.  This on its own was enough to attract me to the game but the rest of it was a little too bland for that to carry me through.  First of all, for how simple and straightforward this game actually is the rules convolute it to hell.  This provides a very steep learning curve and when what you end up with is essentially Risk it certainly isn't worth the effort.  Also, the artwork on the cards is drab and uninspired, in fact the whole game right down to the walls of text that make up the rulebook just put me in a funk.

-Does not feel like any of the numerous RTS games I ever played
-Ugly minimalistic artwork
-Important but very luck-driven combat can decide a game after the first engagement

Very interesting conflict game, cleverly designed and a lot of interesting ideas. However, combat uses too many little tokens, is too long and repetitive, and is just too complicated overall.

I find that If you can get over these flaws, Ares Project is a great game, it is certainly unique, but overall I have a dozen other card games I'd rather play.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65534/the-ares-project]The Ares Project[/url] is a game that I shouldn't comment, but I will. My friend and I played the begginers match, without the special powers of the factions - so the game was basically: use cards to build troops, attack, resolve battle with a lot of dice tossing and, after this, most of them reach and draw - I (or he) couldn't manage to continue with the attack, and neither side could cause damage anymore. The match wasn't long (around 1 hour), but it left a bitter taste, altough, reading the special use for the cards, the full game is sure a different beast.

But, for right now, I'm under impressed by it.

In The Ares Project, 2-4 players are competing to see which of their factions will lead mankind into the future. Each faction has its own deck of cards, buildings, upgrades, attacks, special powers, and a screen behind which a player will play cards. Your opponents do not know what you are building. When a player lays down an attack card, he chooses an opponent, the players drop their screens, and they battle for control of the Frontier, i.e. the center of the table. Whoever controls the Frontier scores points and also has the ability to attack player bases directly. Eliminate your opponent to win instantly, or have the most points when the game ends.

Great game!  It does have a bit of luck factor going with the dice, and it does have a guessing game aspect that can make or break you, but despite that, the game is very deep in both strategy and tactics.  Once the cards are learned, the gameplay speeds up greatly, and you can play a game in just over an hour, so if you get bitten by lady luck, you're not out an entire afternoon and can play again.

I love the asymmetrical play with the 4 different factions, and it is loaded with re-playability.

Sci-fi interactive card game to control the Frontier by incrementally dismantling and weakening your opponents in skirmishes. Player screens hide building upgrades which is a unique twist. Cards are multi-function and card rules with iconology. Each faction plays differently while still sharing the core mechanics. Fun game but fid-d-ly. Not sure that it plays well with more than 2.

I watch Starcraft e-sports in the way that many men watch football.  I was (and still am) a big fan of the Ludology podcast as this game was released.  I absolutely had to try it out.  My feelings are mostly positive though I find it difficult to get this game to the table (for that matter, I have trouble getting my friends to play Starcraft as well...).  I think it really captures some of the feel of the RTS genre and is a very good effort.  I’m not sure that the hidden information aspect feels quite the same as Starcraft.  A big part of Starcraft is bluffing/misrepresenting your strategy.  While that’s possible in this game, it doesn’t have the same impact.  Games of Starcraft are won and lost on the basis of the economy vs army resource allocation. While I think that’s also the case in the Ares Project, I’m not sure that scouting/information gathering has the same razor thin edge between winning and losing as in Starcraft.    

I really like the combat system in the Ares Project as it provides an exciting and dynamic experience.  I’ve had many “stand up dice rolls” in this game.   The theme is also really well done and maintains the basic form of Starcraft excepting that Colossus and Kahoum are both aspects of Protoss.  We find ourselves shouting “AWWWHHH SHUT-TLE!” whenever someone does a Raid or “All right! Overtime!” when someone takes the action of that name.  I’m forever making a wet “pluuuffck” sound when I move my Larvae.  Zar-zugg-zugg-guggug.

This didn't really strike me as something that would be my sort of game, and it really isn't, but it is much more fun than I would have guessed, given that.  Secret accumulation of resources to build your forces... until an attack occurs, at which point [-]units[/-] forces face off like a football line of scrimmage.  Combat is resolved through horrific die rolls, but the variety in the unit types and abilities makes it much more interesting than it could be.

[b]The rulebook should raise the bar for all multipage rulebooks:[/b]  There is a fusion of glossary, index, and rules-distilled-into-mini-encyclopedia near the back.  How the heck does a Raid ATTACK card work?  Look in the index for [i]Raid[/i].  Read the beautifully succinct explanation there.  Still unsure?  No problem:  The page number where you can find the answer is listed to the right, index-style.  Your first couple of plays, you will need to use the rulebook as a reference material, and once I noticed the index, every subsequent question that arose was answered in mere seconds.  That said, the rules aren't so cumbersome that you will stand, ankle-deep in the rulebook each time you play.  Most of it makes good sense, or at least is reasonable, and you will be able to recall easily enough if you play it with any frequency.

Finally, the variety of "factions" at your disposal is very nice.  It's not just "My Heavy Tank attacks your Heavy Tank."  Nope, it's more like "My Artillery attack the Boulders you are telekinetically flinging at my forces."  ...and one of the factions has no base to defend — well, sort of — because it is a gigantic mech, that pretty much acts as a mobile base.

This game is much harder to play than its simple, easy to understand mechanics and well written rules would have you believe. Each turn is one card played from a hand of 3 secretly ether face up for its effect, or face down as a resource. 
This sounds simple enough, but I found myself never sure if I was making the right play on any turn, there is so much information on each unit card to keep track of that it can be overwhelming. I found myself agonizing over every card on almost every turn, and all of my attacks felt like long shots when my opponent would reveal the exact counter to my plain every time.
I am not saying this is a bad game, its an excellent game that is so intensely deep that it it swallowed me up and spewed me out on to the hard desert surface of mars. 
I am looking forward to getting so much better at this game, but for now the surface scratching that I have done has come up gold.

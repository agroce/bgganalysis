Wow:DoW is a good package; scenarios, many planes and extra bits, that you don't get from WoW:FA or WYB only. Planes move very smoothly and there are really good maneuvers.

I haven't played this with more than the basic rules so far, but I don't think it's quite as playable as the WW1 version.  Having said that, I did enjoy it and would play it again, adding some other rules.  We did use our own clouds, cut out from white paper, which was fun.  Somewhat reminiscent of Ace of Aces.

RATING: 1
Completely ruined by Axis & Allies: Angels 20 -- that is everything this game wants to be.

I sooooo wanted to like this game!!  And it is interesting to play every now and then, but the gameplay really just doesn't work for me.  It could be so clever, and yet, it's not.  (It'd be interesting to re-design it -- keep the planes-on-cards format but revisit maneuvering and combat.)

It's been a long time since I played it.  Maybe I'll update it when I get it back to the table, but I don't have a great desire to do so.

Star Wars: X-Wing took the concept and made it better, but at least this game isn't a money pit like X-Wing is.

Played this once.  I like the cards and I like the attention to history and how the theme is incorporated into the game.  My first impression of play: at first, the large range of movement cards seemed cumbersome.  As the game progressed, we all figured out our favored cards and movement selection sped up.  As we sped up however, the cards became fiddly and started to get bumped around and mixed up - I believe we subconsciously rushed through card selection in hopes to capture the feel of aerial combat.  I was fascinated by the movement mechanic but the dogfight feel was lost when everyone's planes simultaneously stopped moving as we simultaneously focused on the cards (albeit, this game would be missing something if there wasn't simultaneous movement).  I had fun, I'd play it again, and I am open to suggestions on how to make this better.

Played again years later, this time with little models instead of cards for planes. The toy factor definately improved the game.

Very similar to the WWI version. I like the damage tokens; they're more convenient than the damage deck and they offer more variety in the weapons.

A good extension to WW2. The battle is fast and furious. Simple, multiplayer and the ownership of having a plane to fight the battle ... Equals to a great game that is very replayable.

Not nearly as fun as the WWI version of the game. The card play mechanic just doesn't seem to fit WWII dogfighting very well at all. If you are looking for a good WWII dogfighting game with pre-painted minis then I'd suggest Angles 20 as a better alternative.

RATING: 9
Rated after first two plays. Much more tense and fast than its older brother. Also the manoeuvres are much broader and flowing. Planning just one card ahead means that the game is more about outmanoeuvering your opponents rather than outguessing them.

RATING: 4
A fun little filler of planning and out-maneuvering. Plays best with loads of people, each controlling only a single fighter. To avoid the end game dragging out, always finish the game once both sides have only a single fighter left (victory goes to the less damaged plane).

RATING: 6.5
2nd impression. Still meh. I love air combat games but this seemed a little to simplistic. Maybe the advanced rules would help but I'm not sure I like the movement mechanic using the cards. It's way too easy to accidentally misalign or bump a card and there's no reference to help you line it up again. Maybe with miniatures or something heavier than cards?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I think is a very good game. It is not s simulation like whistling death is but as a game it can present an abstracted representation of aerial combat. as you fly an airplane you need not worry about banking, or the attitude of your nose when shooting but you do get representation of different speeds of airplanes, and how tight they would turn. in this way it can be a fun game, quick to learn and which can mimic aerial combat. the airplane cards are beatyfull, and a joy to play with. the use of cards to move the airplanes is brilliant as one does not have to be measuring like other miniature games. the card shows excatly where to put the airple to complete the maneuver. on the con side this is not a game to be played on a smooth, table as the cards move very easily, I am surprised no one has come up with a mat that keeps the cards in place (maybe somene has and I dnon`k know about it)in this game there is no representation of armour, at least so far, this becomes more important in the pacific. I hope more airplanes will be added.

Out of the box, it appears to be a more streamlined and advanced version of the WWI Wings of War set: cards for damage have been replaced with counters; alternate manuevers for High and Low speeds; special rules for pilot skills, etc. The component/play template otherwise has been ported over intact with only a few small changes--mostly for the better. IOW, everything you like about the original game is still there. Things you may not appear to have been addressed, if not improved. My sole knit concerns the uniformly excellent illustrations: several camoflauge patterns (Germans and Brits in particular) appear to have been repeated across aircraft from different squadrons which makes them difficult _at first glance_ to tell them apart. Update: our first fight was a couple Zeros vs. a couple Wildcats and a Spitfire which we let a fifth player fly. We may have gotten a couple things wrong, but our bare-bones rules game was faster than typical WoW game. One player seemed disappointed that the Zero wasn't as manuverable as he thought it ought to be...

Stunning graphics, nice scalability in complexity - and fast paced if you concentrate on just one plane per person! Oh, and yes some green poker felt underneath keeps all cards in place & gives you that real high altitude feel! :D

RATING: 7
Played a couple of times, enjoyable but not striking me as great. Only used the basic rules, no optionals yet. My try some of the scenarios, and see if that helps. The altitude seems to much work to bother with, and combining with the fuel option, I don't know how a game is ever finished with decisive kills. Will have to play it a bit more to see what happens.

RATING: 10
ADDENDA: I love WWII Wings of War, but as a product line it's been very oddly developed in my opinion. We now have a core set, a boxed expansion, four blisters, and two sets of minis, all focussed on the early war (pre-42), and we still don't have the core planes for the Battle of Britain - no Me-110s, and no level bombers. I'll be a happy camper when we can finally get those planes and some late-war fighters, plus a P-38. For some reason I really want a P-38 :)
---
Yeah, this is much more fun than the base (WWI) game. Play 4 players, 2:2, with a ground target - for easy play, just play that the attacker has to strafe (you don't need to get into all the bombing rules).
---
ADDENDA: WoW:tDoW really needs to be played with multiple planes per side, much more so than the WWI games. Unlike the WWI incarnations, the differences between planes are not as stark, so it's hard to get a maneuver edge in one-on-one dogfights. So 2:2 (or more) or fixed-objective games are really almost required, even if it means players handling 2 planes each. Fortunately, handling multiple planes is not as onerous as in the WWI version. Although one though I had is that 1:1 dogfights might be more interesting if both players had a few, different ace skills.

Somewhat odd that planes carrying bombs take no maneuver penalties. Is this really accurate? It seems like bombers should be limited to slow, non-steep manuevers. But that might just be me.
---
I really like what they've done with the WWII incarnation of this game. Instead of just a light reworking, the system has been revised and updated and plays somewhat differently. I think the "pipeline" format of playing one card in advance is a little cleaner and easier than the 3-at-a-time WWI version, and it's really cool that the altitude and bombing rules have been included in the basic set, so you can get some cool asymmetric scenarios going right out of the box. I really like the new skill rules for pilots, and the damage counters work a lot better than the cards from Famous Aces (and doubtless are a cheaper solution too, which allowed the inclusion of more maneuver decks). In fact, I think the entire product is a lot cleaner and more playable as both a game and a physical production, as well as providing a somewhat broader range of play options, and the box is a better bang for the buck than previous installments.

My only gripe - and it's admittedly not entirely trivial - is the non-inclusion of virtually all the war's most famous planes. It's an early-war set, so you get the Spitfires, Hurricanes, and Bf-109s, but what about the hard-hitting, leisurely-turning Me-110s? It's nice that we got a few Pacific War fighters as well, but it would have been nice to get all the major planes from the Battle of Britain. Also, the Zero included in the box seems to lack the historical plane's legendary maneuverability. It's an earlier model, but still. Perhaps you need to use the ace pilot abilities to represent Japan's early training edge.

But, there is of course endless possibility for expansion, and I look forward to the day I can fly some late-model Spitfires, P-51s, P-38s, and FW-190s. And of course it's intriguing to contemplate a big B-17 card or a Me-262. I certainly hope we don't have to wait as long as we did to get Watch Your Back! - hopefully the quick sell-out of the Wings of War minis and the rate of Dawn of War sales will convince FFG & Nexus to get us some more product in a timely manner. Wings of War isn't a game I play a ton, but I always get a kick out of it, and I'll be buying for the foreseeable future.

[u]January 10:[/u] Played twice. Nice little game that "simulates" air battle. It is fun to move those fighters on a table. Doesn't resemble any of my other games and this is nice. I've only played 2 players (using 2 planes each) and with the very simple rules. I think the game will be better with more and that adding more rules isn't necessary. The game is probably better kept simple. Maybe some rules would be nice like tailing but definitely not add oil or other unnecessary complicated details.

Fun WWII-themed card-based flight combat game.  I played only once so far, and a 3-player scenario, but it seemed like, for the most part, those of us playing were flying around in circles waiting for the opportunity to fire at the enemy.  The production quality is pretty good overall.

RATING: 6
Aircraft in general, and WWII fighters in specific are a longstanding interest of mine, so this should have been a slam dunk.  However, the flow of play was just too slow to get invested in the game, and I don't really have anyone else that would be interested in playing against me, so this sits on the shelf indefinitely.

Very fun game but I don't think it is for everyone. It plays very smoothly and is great for 4 to 6 players. Also many optional rules to provide more interesting and simulation style table aerial combat. I look forward to more additions to the WWII series.

I like the idea of this game more than I enjoy actually playing it. The nice thing is that the rules are straightforward and its easy to get into very quickly. But I find it to be a bit boring to actually play. 

I think there may be a place in my collection for a quick/light wargame with many players, or as a game to play with a young child. But there are probably better choices for the latter.

Played this twice at Origins 2007 and liked it.  I participated in two 4-player games (two teams).  I was shot down in my first game but shot down both opponents in the second.

It's just as quick and easy to play as the WWI version.  There are differences, most of which are additional features that could be back fitted to the WWI game but a few things are added to represent the differences in air war between the two wars.  If my son really takes more than his current occasional interest in playing Wings of War I may pick this up.

I was ambivalent about this game when I read that it was basically moving cards with no board.  I thought it would be really hard to visualize what was going on.  Turns out it's a relatively simple game to learn (I think my history with Robo Rally helped - this is much easier to get the hang of) and the theme appeals to both my husband and my 8 y.o. son.  First game took a little getting used to (I flew my Messerschmitt off the edge of the table) but once you have the movement of the planes down, the game can move along pretty quickly.  I can see how the addition of miniatures really add to the fun  of this one - the 2 dimensional cards in a dogfight just seems a little dry.  Have ordered a few minis and look forward to playing with them.  Have only played the basic game thus far - will have a look at the advanced rules.  Have only played 2p (2 planes each) so far - I think this would be a great time with 4-6 players.

EXPANSION:

This game is different then the WWI version. Most of the game change reflects in the technology change between the wars. Acceleration rules, less manuever since you are traveling at high speeds and no machine gun jams. Still very fun but plays different.
When I play Wings of Glory/War, I log my plays under the Wings of Glory Starter set.

A step up in the realism department from Blue Max.  However, when it gets to just 2 players w/ 1 plane each, it becomes an endless series of circling around each other. Very limited choice of maneuvers.  At least, with the Basic Game.  Start adding optional rules for altitude, and it changes everything, and really makes it better. So, more realistic, but for playability and the"fun factor", Blue Max wins hands down.

I would say that this is an even more playable version of WoW. Doing away with the three-at-one-time card planning makes the game move faster and reduces "static-ness". Otherwise, the lineage is still there and it still keeps what makes WoW great. One minor peeve is that once you buy the basic set, FFG pretty much has you hook, line and sinker to buy more stuff, as you can't even refight the Battle of Britain with the basic set. I mean, how can you not get the squadron packs, which are mandatory to creating the Battle of Britain? And of course, the expansions that are sure to come later like the Fw 190 and the Mustang etc.?

RATING: 8
This is an extraordinary amount of fun and well-suited for older children and upwards, and it is the kind of game that leaves you wanting to play again immediately.  Easy to learn, and instant appeal!  The WW2 game (Dawn of War) has a card mechanism that is an improvement on the original WW1 game (Famous Aces), and it also has the advantage of coming with six decks instead of four.  It might be worth considering getting some of the miniatures if it proves to have staying power.  "a fairly simple blind bidding auction game with a spatial element."  A brilliant concept! The only downside is that the game can be somewhat fiddly getting all the damage chits facedown (solution: put them in custom made bags as seen [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2163925#2163925]here[/url]), and there's also the issue of cards moving around when using a flat playing surface like a table (solution: play on felt).  Don't miss the errata [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/242142]here[/url]. To get a sense of game-play, try the flash game "Steam Birds", which was designed by someone who'd played Wings of War.

RATING: 4
Playing this game by the rules in the rule book (where you get a limited number of cards) is the funniest game I have ever had. I had tears in my eyes I was laughing so hard.

I played my first cards and the plane veered off to the left slightly. After that I didn’t draw any cards apart from straight on so my plane promptly flew off the end of the table and out of the game. The other players didn’t do much better. In fact I think we only shot at each other about 3 times in the whole half hour of silliness.

Its a nice game with indepth rules reflecting the reality of planes of the era its just not the game for me although I will always have fond memories of that first game.

Sold in 2012.

A lot of fun from small cards packaged in a little box. The miniatures are optional but for some they add a visual and tactile flair (the toy factor)
Player-generated sounds are mandatory!
The minus is due to me being peeved that the starter box doesn't come with at least two sets for all the deck types.

Yet to be seriously played (26/12/08) UPDATE: hmmm, three years later, and still haven't got round to playing it! I occasionally get keen, but when I start preparing for a practice game, before you know it, I have put it all back in the box.  But one day I hope to play, so a rating of 6 (4/12/11) UPDATE: With Star Wars X-Wing miniatures, its a good guess this might never get played! (rating down to 5, 3/11/12). UPDATE: True! Gone!

RATING: 7.5
I was a little leary on this game at first due to the faster planes and wasn't sure how that would be handled. You have speed markers for low and high speed that you play on the cards, and then each card has 2 arrows. One for high and one for low speed. Depending on which speed marker you played on the card at the beggining is which arrow you will follow. It actually works out great and these planes move fast and turn completely different than in Famous Aces. The game is a big improvement with the cards, beings that they have an outline as to where to place the next card on it and the graphics are better too. Also, the playing of one card as opposed to 3 at the start of a turn gives you much more flexability and control over your planes.

The only really bad thing that I did not like at all with the game is the damage counters. There are so many of them and they are very small and very hard to read the symbols on them. I wish they would have stuck to using cards for damage and had different decks for each.

786- Remember those old movies about the Battle of Britain? Just imagine yourself in the cockpit of Spitfire preparing to take on a Messerschmitt just above the white cliffs of Dover. As long as you have a good imagination, this well-designed, low complexity air war game will almost get you there. While you can play w/ 2 to 6 pilots, better interaction occurs w/ at least 4 planes in the air. (Ex. w/ 2 players, each person controls 2 planes. For new players, most people suggest this is the best Ed. to start with.

There at first seems to be less variety among the planes, because they all maneuver much the same, but they deal different levels of damage, which is the opposite of the WWI version where each plane does the same amount of damage but each maneuvers much differently. All in all an excellent game but I like the first one more because I prefer biplanes.

RATING: 7.5
My first Wings of War game.  I'm a bit anxious to see whether I'll like the original WWI games better or worse.  I could see where this could last longer than it should with the wrong people, but I found it very enjoyable when played quickly. 

EDIT: I like the basic system of 3 card planning a bit better in the original WWI games.  However, I like the variety that the switch from damage decks to damage chits allows.  This game is probably the best Wings of War value as it comes with SIX maneuver decks. (four unique, two duplicates)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is really clever.  It can be a chatoic, "gotcha" party game, enjoyed by 6 year olds, 16 year olds, and 36 year olds.  Or it can be a somewhat serious flight simulation game with a suprising amount of chrome.  Totally depends on the crowd, and what rules you play it with.  It's rare you get a party game and a chromey wargame in the same box . . .

Pleasantly surprised with how well it scales, both in terms of players and difficulty.

I'm not much of a wargamer, but I love airplanes and this game is just about perfect.  

The rules are simple and clear.  The movement system is beautifully done and it plays fast.  It's easy to teach people and even non-airplane gamers have fun with it.

I haven't played the original WWI version, but now I'll have to pick that up as well.

The closest thing to a complaint is that even with several expansions the game doesn't include many of the later, famous aircraft of WWII such as Mustangs, Corsairs and Lightnings.  Hopefully those are in the works.

This game features the move-programming of RoboRally, but without the board. Unfortunately, the game is mostly planes just trying to get in the general vicinity of each other and not so much about strategizing how to best defeat your opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The WWII theme just doesn't grab me, and if anything this version is fiddlier than the Great War version with the addition of two speeds, chits instead of damage cards, and a more complicated damage system. Like with "regular" WoW, this is best played in teams, with one plane to a person, and best played in mission format rather than dogfight. Perhaps I'm being a bit unfair; maybe we'll see if I play it some more. The biggest difference seems to be the greater control you have over your planes by planning only one move ahead--it could make for some very long fights if both players are cautious or careless.

Picked this up as a easy and light 'plane game' for playing with my kids. The rules look like they can expand out the complexity whenever we are ready for more challenge and such.

I might have to get some miniatures though because the cards slide around really easy.

Also, I think I'll always play with some form of altitude in a more serious game from now on to prevent people from just Immelmann'ing the whole game once we all get in a pile.

There's a whole lot packed into a high quality, well-engineered box.  The artwork is beautiful.  The cards are small, but nicely trimmed and coated.  However, their size is perfect for the function that they perform on a tabletop.  The top-down aircraft drawings on the cards are just about the same scale as my 1/285 and 1/300 GHQ, Heroics &Ros, and Airpower miniatures...sweet!  I purchased an additional copy for a friend.  We hope to play this week (Sept.23-28, 2007).

RATING: 6
The best thing of this game is how something as complicated as emulating the flight of a fighter can be done in such a simple and clever way. Having mentioned that, we have a whole game based on an initially complicated premise that is very intuitive and, most important, fun.

What I found a bit more disappointing was the damage mechanism, which can sometimes be way too random, but other than that is okay. The heights and so on can be a bit confusing until you get used to them, but isn't nothing that you can't deal with. The theme is extremely catchy and well implemented and, if not the ultimate air combat simulation, all seems quite realistic.

What more to say? Well, if you like WWII or are looking for a game about piloting a single fighter that really gives you the feeling of being inside the cabin, give this a try: it won't  let you down.

Optimal number of players:

RATING: 7
I'm a huge fan of WWII era aircraft, and this game is a fantastic blend of gameplay and WWII aircraft simulation. The maneuvers and aircraft stats seem to reflect a somewhat abstract, but not unrealistic representation of the various aircraft. Yet the game plays easily, with very little to bog it down. The basic game is easy to get into, and there are plenty of optional rules to make the game play a little more realistic and enjoyable for those that like more depth. Great potential for adding house rules as well. I love this game.

On the down side, the development & expansion of this game has been slow apparently, with long waits for new aircraft. Four year after release, there are still only a few well known aircraft like Spitfires & Bf-109s. The game is missing some key fighter aircraft and we're still waiting for level bombers. No P-51s. No Me-110s. No FW-190s. No P-38s. Now that the former game publisher is gone, and the game has been picked up by a new publisher under the game title "Wings of Glory", hopefully we'll see a new trend including quicker, more significant releases.

A unique little fun game with extra depth to be explored.

My group loved this game the first time we played it. There was laughing, taunting, and just all around smiles. It's good fun trying to tail each other and shoot them down. Using the cards for movement is a great little idea, and the chit draw for damage is fun and exciting.

We only played with the basic ruleset but there are more advanced rules just begging to be used. Also we seem to find that this really works great for 4...looking to try 6 though as it would probably be a hoot. (I have now tried 6 and it is a blast.)

I highly recommend having this game or it's WWI version in your collection.

This is a fantastic little game -- it's a wargame that isn't: plays in 20 minutes, no fuss, great components, fluid gameplay with just the right amount of quirkiness (in the form of prepping maneuvers), and none of the usual LOS/cover/etc. to worry about.

It's a lot cooler with miniatures than the cards it comes with, but the basic box is still a great value -- lots of planes, and enough decks for six players.

Unfortunately, it's not hitting the table as often as I'd like as my girlfriend doesn't share my interest in WWII and thinks this is the worst game she's ever played... and she has a copy of Game of Life.

Loads of optional rules, giving the game a modular, customisable feel.

An interesting idea and seems really cool at first, but there are too many bits to move around and the game play is really slow at two. Perhaps with four players each controlling only one plane it would be better. Not really my type of game though.

The WWII theme works better than WWI. Truly enjoyable when playing with all the optional rules. Also as well as in many other games, keep the planning phase quite short.

The rules don't work as well for WW2 as they do for the WW1 version.  Still I love WW2 planes, so it will have to do.  I really want to play with bombers, but I haven't figured out a good way of doing so yet.

RATING: 6
Quite a lot of fun. Works best with 4 or 6. 2 player is a little slow due to having to program 2 planes at the same time.

My favourite tactic in a 2 player game is the 'Thatch Weave'. Works every time. :-)

Some changes from WWI that keep the game fresh and interesting. Slightly more complex, mainly due to the rolling maneuver cards (two cards face down, reveal/resolve one, plot another, then reveal/resolve the one in the queue). All in all, prefer the WWI version, but this is also solid.

Two plays.  Need to get this to the table more to cement or modify its rating.  Team play was more fun than every man for himself.  On the basis of the first game, this would be a '9' or '10'. Lack of table time has seen me drop this to an '8' as I've gone a bit cold on it.

Traded, along with 'Fire from the Sky'.

Good idea and execution. Out of the box, it is a 6-player game. The game is fast and fun, but can drag on a little bit when only one pilot remains in each side. The first one (based on the First Great War aereal conflicts) appears to have better pacing.

More intense than its older sister.  I don't like this one as much, largely due to its implementation.  The chits for damage are harder to deal with and the damage indicators on the cards are virtually unreadable.  I had to make a cheat sheet.  Translation: Rookie mistakes make this game harder to play for no good reason.

RATING: 6
As a big fan of the original WOW I was looking forward to a WW2 update but after playing three times now I must say its been a real dissapointment. 

The new system of only planning one card ahead has slowed gameplay down and sucked the fun out of flying. Add in the fact that you have to choose speed counters now and you feel like your spending more time in the book keeping and planning than the action on the table. The different speeds would have been much better represented by having seperate cards instead of fiddly counters. I realise this would have added to the cost but if it makes gameplay better then I don't think anyone would complain. The other option would be to drop the variable speed altogether as it adds very little to gameplay.

Our group are thinking of tryng this out again using the old system of three cards blind.

I really expected to like this game a lot more than I did, particularly after enjoying the original so much.  However, I found it a less than engaging experience.  While I did enjoy the options for different speeds with your maneuvers, in the demo we played, it didn't matter whether you switched or how often or anything.  Maybe it matters and we just didn't play with those rules.  Still, it didn't feel right.  At any rate, the maneuvering was not interesting.  For the most part, we ended up just reversing back and forth over and over again.  Boooooring.  Perhaps the rules for altitude and fuel that were mentioned would make this game more interesting.  What really bothered me, though, were the damage tokens.  The variable damage in the first game was annoying, but on a level that was livable.  The variability in this one just made the game madly unpleasant.  So, I suppose I would play again, but I certainly don't have the urge to pick up a copy of my own like I did after playing the first Wings of War. [08/11/2007]

I had honestly thought I was done with Wings of War/Glory when X-Wing came out. 

However, much to my disappointment, X-Wing did not benefit from the "grab from the shelf, throw on the table, and enter into epic warfare" that the Wings of War/Glory system did. The customization of squads firmly took X-Wing out of the casual gaming arena, which is the only arena that I have time to play around in.

It was quite refreshing when Sag and I spotted the WWII Starter set on the Library shelf at Games and Stuff and decided to give it a go. It took a while to get back into the grove of things (we actually had to restart because I was cheating pretty hard (because I forgot a very important rule regarding Immelmann turns)) but we had a blast and in the end simultaneously blasted each other out of the sky.

It was a damn good time.

This is a fun little game! Requires only 3 minutes of explanation, and almost no setup time. Can be played anywhere on an even surface and is just raw fun. Way better as expected.

Also contains a ton of extra options for variability, but as we usually use this as our waiting pastime until the whole gaming group is complete don't expect to delve much into these.

Did hit the dogfighting itch enough to acquire its sequel, so that says something!

Played my first game of this via email.  It was a 5 vs. 5 dogfight.  Every move was very intense.  I can see this easily becoming a game where AP strikes it's players.  I found it was a little chaotic in that it required you to guess your opponents moves just to get a hit...which makes it feel less strategic and more luck based.  The idea is to maximize your potential and minimize your opponents.

quite good fun, the kids like this one too.  Not sure about the rules the basic set is actually quite simple and allows for a sort of stalemate situation as you all fly in circles. Using the fuel rules would help but as the further rules are all optional but its hard to pick which to use as well, I think using them all may make it cumbersome beyond what the kids feel comfortable with.

Fantastic game system and mechanism. Remind me of the good old child days when playing on the floor with my toy planes. It is possible to play all from very simple games to very complex war games and it works fine - at least for us - to play without the miniature planes and just use the plane cards. You can easily create your own scenarios and campaigns and add new home-made components if you like (I do!). Only downside is that you quickly want to have all the expansions but I will recommend you to spend your money on them before starting to collect the miniature planes - the game works very well without having them (the miniature planes)

RATING: 4
Too fiddly for the resolution of the simulation.  What I mean is, it's trying to get you to do a real-time simulation of dogfighting, with an admittedly clever mechanic, but at the same time the planes are just bits on the table.  Also, I would like to see chips rather than cards to program the planes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Neat idea, but in practice it's a little rough. Takes a long time for the degree of randomness in the damage (anywhere from miss to instant death in the same draw pile is quite a range). My play was on a smooth surface, which didn't work well at all, but even if you had a tablecloth or something, it'd be pretty easy to change the alignment of the planes as you're shuffling around, even inadvertently.

I also don't really like programmed actions as a mechanic, so I was a bit predisposed against this one.

RATING: 6.9
Same quality and game style with similar mechanics as wings of war but with WWII cards and maneuvers.  I'm not as big on this type of game being applied to WWII as it seemed better suited to the slower pace and maneuvers of WWII aircaft.  Still it works OK and is a logical extension of the game it grew out of.

I really like this game and really, [i]really[/i] want to try it out with the altitude rules one of these days, but it has proven extremely tough to get it to the table as anything but a solo game - and with the simultaneous play there's a bit too much to keep track of in a solo game if you go much beyond the basic rules.

Getting several of the minis would be awesome, but I doubt it would make this game any more likely to get onto the table so they're not really a consideration right now.

This is just a very cool game.  I was always a fan of the WW1 version - and it did look sharp with miniatures.  But...WOW.  This adds a LOT.  The constant dynamic of move-move-move-move-etc rather than the turn breaks of the previous game makes for more exciting play.  The damage mechanic (three different chit piles rather than card decks) is also superior.  Better (more interesting) 'ace' rules.  etc.  And the table talk is still as intense!  Most of our group seemed to treat the 3-card planning of the first game as one 'maneuver' anyway, so planning one maneuver at a time, here, just doesn't change the play time much.

Mike dropped this off in a pile of games that he no longer wanted / had space for, and I had low expectations for this it. I was pleasantly surprised when I read the rules, and was then not disappointed by playing it. There is no figuring and no down time. All phases are simultaneous. 

In the first scenario team evil was represented by Donnnnie and myself and team righteous was represented by Dan and Miner. Only ace pilot Donnnnie flew away.

Fun!  One of the few games that's better with the basic rules.  We throw a few of the advanced rules in (tailing & hit the plane itself) that seem logical, but that's it.  Simple to teach, easy for most anyone to enjoy, even a non-gamer.

You have to be one who takes the accidental bump/spin of the cards with a grain of salt in order to enjoy it.  The cards do move around... but just go with it.

Sometimes a player can be left out as the remaining planes battle for the win, but that's about the only complaint i'd say.

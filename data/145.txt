Sort of an early version of Chinatown / Big City. You collect lots of land, and then build on them. Building types influence how much other points are worth. Not a bad game, but has it's reputation based on being hard to acquire for several years. Owned and sold.

RATING: 7
It's likely that this game was ahead of it's time in 1984, but games like Big City and Chinatown have improved on this design, so this game feels a bit obsolete to me. It was still fun, but there seemed to be few building options half way through the game and not much player interaction. The negociating was never lively. Fast, and pretty fun, but a little dated.

I watched a group play this, but didn't participate myself. Nevertheless, it looked very interesting. The battles for control of neighborhoods and individual buildings were quite varied, and choosing your building resources for the next round seemed challenging.

Cute game, but the negotiation part of the game just kills it for me.  I like games to snap along, and I'm usually too impatient to sit around working out a deal with people.  Plus, I like Big City a lot better for this type of game.

I believe this is the only other Sackson game I know besides Acquire. While playing Metropolis, I wasn't aware that he was the author. I might as well have guessed as the build sites offering is quite acquiresque.

I found Metropolis to be quite fun. However, it's age - as IMO with Acquire - does show. It feels to me that Metropolis really needs that extra idea - that extra dimension. Auctions or whatever. 

It's quite nice, but I don't think it has a lot of repeat value given the many great quality games around these days. After all, the Golden Age of Gaming is NOW! Metropolis would have no chance in today's market crowded by far more interesting designs. No way this oldie should be rereleased. Not that it's bad. It isn't, but most of todays games happen to be better (at least those I get to play).

Still a valiant effort for its time. Certainly way better than say Auf Achse - a Spiel des Jahres winner of about the same time. Used to like it as a kid, but then I didn't really know really good games back then... (until I got Adel Verpflichtet as a gift).

RATING: 6
A fun tactile experience, laying out the plastic city. However, the game, for three players, doesn't create enough incentive to trade as most of the time you can go it alone. I suspect it is at it's best with five players as people would be forced to negotiate more often. In the end, with three players, there wasn't all that much game there. You were mostly just doing whatever you could to score points.

I don't like negotiation games so I was predisposed towards not liking this. Well, what can I say, I was right. Now, apart from my predisposition Metropolis is a nice enough game, especially considering its age. There are differences to the much younger Chinatown, for example, but they are far smaller than the much better rating for Chinatown would make you believe. The order in which the lots come up is a major factor in both games in any case.

For such a light game with moderate luck it dissapoints.  It's not really about negotiation but more about who can you screw more, because often times there is little or no negotiation involved.

Seminal city-building game of negotiation, planning and timing.  Metropolis is one of the few outstanding German games from the early 80s (along with Wildlife Adventure, Niki Lauda's Formel 1, and Kuhhandel), and is the obvious template for both Chinatown and Big City.  Big City stripped out the negotiation elements and focused on the property adjacencies, creating a lighter and more streamlined game.  Chinatown went the opposite direction, focusing solely on the negotiation but throwing out all the interesting and sophisticated parts of the game.  It's amazing to me that Metropolis remains relatively unknown while its shoddy knockoff Chinatown is viewed as some kind of Holy Grail.

Don't build too early!  It will hamper your ability to claim new property, which requires an undeveloped adjacent lot (unless the block has six or more unclaimed lots or no one owns an undeveloped adjacent lot).  On the other hand, if you wait too long, you may find the building supply exhausted.  Quite the quandary!  Also, the big projects almost always give the best returns if they're well located.  Figure out a way to build them, even if it means you have to share the profit with other players.

Trading victory points should not be allowed.  This is implied in the rules by the stated procedure for splitting joint profits - each player earns in proportion to the number of lots contributed.  The rules for claiming property are also a bit murky.  There are no restrictions for claiming property if there are six or more unclaimed (no markers or buildings) lots on the block.  Otherwise, you must own an undeveloped lot (not a building!) adjacent to the property you want to claim, with one exception . . . . If no one owns an adjacent undeveloped lot, anyone may claim the new property regardless of whether the block has crossed the 50%-claimed threshold.

Hmmm, I know Big City has problems, but the luck of the draw on Metropolis can be brutal. People say, "well you can trade your bad draws". Well this only really applies in the very beginning of the game. Once things are only slightly getting established, there is almost never any reason for someone to trade with you. And the restriction on drawing cards based on abutment rights also really hurts this for me. Unless you have it in your hand early on, you can get no bargaining power for other properties that might help you. In Big City at least you can draw cards in the new neighborhoods that are not established and pull yourself out of the mess you might be in where you are at at the time. The bits are nice, but it doesn't really help the game for me. Big City will always be the first choice for me. Oh well, at least I've finally played it.

I'm always up for trying a Sackson game, with some titles aging well and being loved games in my collection. Unfortunately, Metropolis will not be one of them. This is a city-building negotiation game. The board is divided into 80 lots. Players start with a few lots drawn at the beginning of the game and each turn a player takes a new lot from a face up display, builds a building if they want to and can, or negotiates/trades openly with other players in order to exchange lots or share the ownership of constructed buildings. Sounds pretty good, right?

There are two problems that haunt the game. From what I understand, those who play the game today have mitigated these concerns with house-rules. That's great, but I tend to ask "why bother?" One - and this is one I could live with - is that the random assignment of lots at the beginning of the game and what comes up on the draw each turn can have an outsized effect on a player's fortunes. The second is the rule that says when 5 lots are owned in a block, spaces can only be claimed by the players already neighboring them. If the four lots on display can each only be developed by one player and none of them are the active player - then that player is sapped of negotiating leverage and must simply take a card and hand it to the player who can build on it. This creates a situation anathema to a negotiation game! So, pretty disappointing, this one.

Sid Sackson's games were ahead of their time and most of them are still playable today. This is true for Metropolis as well. It's a city building game driven by negotiation. The rules are simple but provide enough framework for meaningful decisions and trades. Trades are not as varied as in Catan. Less numerous, a single trade will have a larger importance. The luck factor involved in the card draw of plots is acceptable and second to player decisions.

Metropolis seems to have inspired a few other games, most notably Big City and Chinatown. Big City could be seen as a more modern and accessible version due to the abandoment of negotiations and more elements to keep spoiled gamers engaged. I only read about Chinatown whose main improvement apparently are more sophisticated negotiations.

A few rules ambiguities have to be resolved. Specifically, the shared construction of buildings isn't explained well. We decided that we leave a number of chips on the buildings equivalent to the ratio of plots contributed by individual players. In the end, we distributed points with fractions. We also ruled that buildings are also considered to be 'neighbouring' which isn't 100% clear from the rules.

Another innovative design from Sackson.  It's impressive, considering it came out in 1984 and I'm not only talking about the colour palette.  Simply put players draft cards that provide them with ownership of lots and then can build on the lots (if they own all of the lots required for the building size).  Of course getting lots side by side is not too easy so players negotiate shares in a building, can swap lots, etc.  There are bonuses for location (factory by a river, apartment by the park, hospital downtown, etc.) and penalties (house by a factory, etc.).  Because of all the different building combos and that you're often receiving a fraction of the building's point value there is a lot of number crunching... this could make the game drag so try to keep your calculations to a minimum.

A watered-down child of Acquire and distant ancestor of Chinatown. Sid Sackson, this game is proof you can also put out mush. 

There's an asymmetrical city grid. On your turn, claim one of the 4 available lots on the grid (if legal, otherwise give one to a legal owner), then optionally place/claim one or more Tetris-ish buildings on your lots. Buildings score points based not just on size, but also on affinities (for example houses are more valuable near shops and less valuable near factories, something any SimCity player will instinctively understand.)

I dunno, I admire Sid Sackson's games, but this one seems a bit dated, especially the fixed, every time the same board. And its semi-cooperative aspect rarely worked for us.

Was excited to try this relatively hard-to-come-by Sid Sackson game. The components are nice and the rules are easy, but the scoring is remarkably complex (think: spreadsheet). We could tell it's supposed to be an active negotiation game, but people were spending as much time in thinky calculations as actually wheeling and dealing. The lot# cards create a lot of luck and chaos as well -- many times the lot I needed was handed to a competing player for free because it simply wasn't yet in the choices on my turn.

Mostly rehashing mechanics previously used by Sid Sackson in other games (filling the board by numbers, having cards exposed up for grabs, flexible scoring), Metropolis was nevertheless innovative in its own terms as it incorporated these mechanics in a negotiation game format about building a functional town - Big City and Chinatown, its most obvious offspring, were published more than a decade later.

While there aren't many choices for drawing each turn, and draws can as a result influence the play rather heavily (especially towards the endgame), good risk estimation and negotiation skills can help overcome strokes of bad luck - even for only two players the well-implemented dependencies among the buildings can enable some common ground to attempt deals (and also for some tactical backstabbing). The flow of the game is really smooth and the topic suits the main driving force of the game: cooperation is needed to boost each player's final score.

Has issues with limited choices available on your turn (only four, and usually two to four of those are useless to you) and the role of chance, but the negotiation possibilities improve it slightly and it has enough strategy and tactics to make it a game worth playing once, perhaps again. Still, not one I would pick out of a stack of good games.

This game is really not as much fun as I thought it would be.  The rules for taking available lots made it where there was really little choice in what you took.  Despite the availability of trading, it often did not have as much effect on our games as it could.  We end up doing a lot of shared buildings.  Also the changing points values make it difficult to keep up with who is winning, which hinders good decision-making regarding some deals.  Although I enjoy Manhattan and Big City more, this is one I still want to play every now and again.

RATING: 7
A light-weight area control game that carries itself as a mid-weight area control game due to the scoring chart. After 2-3 games you realize where it's best to place buildings and the learning curve drops significantly. At that point it's a light-weight but it offers small doses of negotiation and press your luck which deepens the standard area control experience. A bit dated, but it's still a solid area control game for today.

This is a light gateway game to the world of Euro negotiations.  This can be played either laid back and social or math heavy, the former is preferable otherwise this game would quickly devolve into Social A/P where no move is a good move.  I rather like it and think that it is so far ahead of its time that even if it came out today it would have a viable audience.  

This game certainly paved the way for Chinatown and Big City.  While I think that both of those games are individually better in focus, this encompasses a larger scale and is still quite enjoyable.  I'm glad to have all three.

RATING: 5
Solidly ok. Ideally you want to get in on the most buildings, whether that's building on your turn most often, and/or getting in on other players' building efforts most often. So much depends on how the lots randomly come up, it's sort of hard to take the game too seriously. On the other hand, there's perfect information and a lot of potential calculation at the margin, so you have to make a trade-off of how much math you are actually willing to do to calculate everyone's positions and potential payoffs from each action. It's good to know the ideas here have been stolen and possibly improved on by such games as Chinatown and Big City. I haven't played those, but I suspect I'll like them better.

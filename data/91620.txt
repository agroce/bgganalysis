Fairly thematic game about painting that uses set collection upon set collection, as well as trading and tile-laying mechanics, all put together in a nice, overproduced package.

I almost overlooked this game, but bought it thanks to Ender's review.  Glad I did, as the wife loves it, and I find it to be a decent game, and particularly impressive as a first design.  It's definitely a euro, with a whole mish-mash of tried and true mechanics, which by and large work on the whole.  I personally enjoy the theme, and it is implemented pretty clearly in this game.  I've never been a big fan of small cards, which this game has, and the "board" is totally superfluous, and while it would normally be a nice touch, the colour ordering doesn't even make sense, plus it takes up alot of space.  The painting tiles are very nice, as are the quality of the paint tiles.  The box is superb, not that that generally matters.  A big issue is that there really are too many things to hold/hide; apparently this will be addressed in future versions with art easels, which hopefully will be made available to early adopters.

The game seems to scale well from 2-4 players, and plays smoothly and easily IF people don't get bogged down with AP planning out the perfect tile-placement and colours.  That said, if you don't do some planning it's tough to play well so you need to somehow strike a balance here.  The hand limit, and colour requirements all work, although it is weird how it's so hard to get a primary colour (although necessary for the game mechanics I guess).  Overall a very solid design.

Own the expansion.

Awesome paint-mixing mechanic in the game. The game itself offers interesting decisions and was well received by new and experienced gamers alike. Played this 2-player with my wife and she enjoyed immensely and requested for a rematch after I'd won the first game. She really enjoyed the game's colour-mixing mechanic. So I reckon this game should go down well as one to keep!

Amazing game!! Has quickly become one of my favorites
- The theme is beautiful and really strong throughout the game
- The play style is fun and strategic, but not too difficult to enjoy with people less experienced at gaming
- The cardboard pieces, cards, box, and rule book are all of the HIGHEST quality. All are thicker and more durable than I have seen in almost any other game I have played. The box is the most sturdy I have every seen. This game is meant to last.

Cool game of resource management.  Beautiful production, but as Matt mentioned, it takes up so much space for the board/cards, and they aren't really where the game's at.  A little innovation here.

-1 for the colors not being the easiest things to tell apart, unfortunately.

RATING: 7
A rather interesting game.  Resource collection around mostly personal goals for conversion into victory points.  I love the resource collection element - placing hexes on the board to form desired colors.  LOVE that part.  Very lukewarm on painting selection, but there are enough in the common pool that you should be able to deal with it and work around things.  Love the 3 --> 1 exchanges and really just the exchange rate part in general.

So why only a 7?  Two things.  First, AVOID BISQUE.  For whatever reason, bisque (the color in the game) is a full point below its constituent parts.  Making anything with bisque is a loss of at least 1 point over its elements.  Which is silly.  Second, I wonder if the game isn't too evenly balanced.  I'd need a few more plays to tell, but it looks like it could be.  If so, the winner would be determined by arbitrary, tiny differences in the respective players' actions.  Not awful, but not quite desirable either.

In any case, this game has some really interesting elements.  I would gladly play it again.  Plays somewhat quickly (as long as players don't obsess too much over placement of the hexes) and even has some informational aspects.  This is unique enough that I might pick it up (International Edition only).

RATING: 7.5
One of the best family game that has a bit of everything. From education about colors and paintings, to competition for the right colors with hex tiles, to hand management, to optional needs to change commissions and still win the game with the right amount of useful color cards in hand....

The production is top notch and each painting on each holder is an excellent way to hide like Fog of War and yet beautifully displayed as if you are really painting that picture.

Excellent game that can be done in an hour and a half. Great for kids at early grades.

The solidity and beauty of Pastiche make it into a work of art itself. Abundant high-detail images of well-chosen artwork, super thick box, sturdy components, and beveled box edges = amazing "museum-quality" production throughout. It's also fun and challenging to play!

RATING: 8
Fun little tile laying game. It's not more difficult to learn than Carcassonne but the scoring is easier. However, there is a bit more thought to laying your tiles so it might be a notch more difficult that Carc. There can be a bit of AP trying to juggle all of your colors, what you can make and what you need to complete the paintings. It's not the greatest theme in the world from my point of view but at least it's not Ancient Egypt or Medieval building! I can certainly live with the painting theme, it's unique enough to at least make it interesting. Overall, a really good family game. Actually reminds me a bit of Bazaar.

Indeed, the components are of EXTREMELY high quality, and it is graphically a beautiful game. AND, this game about colours and art is actually playable by the colour blind!
However, it is darn annoying trying to keep track of your hidden hexes (small size), hidden palette cards (moderate size) and hidden commission cards (large size).
On to the theme: I've read that Mr. MacDonald originally intended Pastiche to be themed as a "paint by numbers" game, and I wish he had stuck with that. As it stands now, you don't really have the foggiest idea what you're doing thematically. Are you the Methuselah of the art world, painting different works over your 600 year career? Are you an art forger, trying to pass off accurate fakes to an unwitting public? Are you a Vincent van Gogh type of painter, deranged and not sure what your real style is, or what your real identity is? While Pastiche is elegantly draped with theme, the dress just doesn't fit very well at all.
Mechanically, everything works together well, nothing clunky about it; but it's just a very dry, puzzle solving exercise that long overstays its welcome. Pastiche is the old phrase of "watching the paint dry" put into a boardgame format. Mind you, if you like puzzle solving, and couldn't care less about theme, then Pastiche might be for you.

This is a gorgeous game that is just so pretty to look at. It is a perfect family game for the following reasons:
-no in-game text
-educational
-some decision making but not overwhelming
-simple rules that are easy to remember
-reasonable playing time. (under 1 hour)
-easy set up
-appealing and simple enough for a wide range of ages.
Although, this isn't a game that I would bring out on game night or to play with my husband, it is a great for family game night.

Truly a delightful and beautiful game.  After one play with my 9-year-old son, he said that he liked it better than all my "other games" (read: heavier or Euro games) and that he would go and rate it a 10 on BGG.  After three plays, I'm definitely in his camp.

The game is mechanically simple, yet brings a wonderful tactical element into play.  The set collection isn't too easy -- you'll never end a turn with more than 8 cards in hand -- but it isn't grindingly difficult, either.  In addition, this is one of the best-produced games I've ever seen; the heft of the components is startlingly good, as is the visual impact.

I would put this right next to Ticket to Ride as far as gateway games go.  Though at this point I haven't yet had the opportunity to introduce it to anyone outside my family, I expect that it would go over even better than TTR, due to the pretty.

Update (August 2011): After a few more games, I have to reduce my rating a touch.  It seems difficult to differentiate yourself; all games seem to end closely, due to the balance of the portraits.  This seems to remove some of the skill from the game.  Still quite good, though.

RATING: 4.3
Collect paint cards based off of laying tiles. Trade paint cards to get other paint cards. Convert paint cards into points by completing paintings. Very simple and dry. A minimal amount of hand management and tile placement strategy.

Overall feeling that optimal play requires exhaustive analysis of paint tile placement. Somewhat enjoyable as long as you don't spend too much time analyzing the board. It doesn't seem like this is too deep of a game, but I think it might appeal to the more casual gamer. It seems like this could easily be converted into a solo game or be extended to more players.

The components are overall quite attractive (though my easels are pretty shoddy in quality).

Based off of a few 2-player and 4-player games.

One of the most "thematic" abstract games out there. It is fun to combine the various colours to get new ones but unfortunately the all-changing set collection goal in each round makes it just another abstract game with vague purpose.

Initial Impression: Pastiche comes across as a light, serene tile laying and set collection game. However, as I played it I felt that there may have been something more. The trading aspect allows for player interaction and the mixing of colors reminds me of the resource exchange euros of Uwe Roesenberg style. The components are excellent, with heavy commission tiles and wooden easels to pimp the game. My daughter seems to enjoy this one so I expect to play it more often.

Others say: Too long and not good with AP prone persons, too light, few meaningful decisions, an accessible and pretty good casual/gateway game, repetitive gameplay, strategically shallow, artist bonus for 2 paintings breaks the game (winner usually got the bonus, others didn't), poor rules since they don't call for equal turns, limited player interaction, multiplayer solitaire, feels like Bazaar by Sid Sackson but Bazaar is better.

RATING: 6
Although harsh, I think my rating is reasonable for this game.  It just boils down to analyzing the hexes and trying to optimize your cards without giving your opponents an easy winfall.  I've always disliked player-trading games and this one is no exception.  The board is stupid large and even it is not organized very well... the colors should have been sorted to show what can be traded 3:1 for.  Shuffling the hexagons is a pain, and how in the heck are you supposed to shuffle the commission tiles?  They are HUGE and thick...  I don't typically nit-pick production values that much, but there are just too many issues with this one!

I can't imagine playing this with AP players... it would be murder to sit through.  I'm disappointed in this game.  Too big, too messy, too much AP, too little ooh and aaah... bleh.

Nothing wrong with this game, other than perhaps replayability? I know there are a LOT of paintings, but it could feel as though you are just doing the same thing over and over again. Having said that the quick gameplay, easy rules and great components make it a good edition to the game closet.

This is a game that's better in theory than in practice.

This game forces you to make a very poor choice:  either make a quick turn and do something almost randomly, or spend 10 minutes and bore yourself and everyone else to death.   Perhaps if you wanted to treat this game a little like chess where you spend ages thinking about a move then it would be okay, but I don't get the impression that it's supposed to be played like that.... nor would I or anyone I know want to play this game like that.

I award the game a 9/10 for presentation.  I thought it all looked very impressive.

However, the top point above is the important one.  This fails as a game, and as such gets an initial rating of 4.

Cute, light, color conversion game with a neat spatial mechanic that keeps the game play from getting boring. There is very little you can do to get much better at it, though, and since there is virtually no player interaction, it's more of a pleasant activity than a game. Whatever, it's mildly entertaining and looks great on the table.

Pretty cool game of placing tiles to get various colors, and trading them around to mix the various other colors you'll need.  If played with the wrong people, I could see this being an analysis-paralysis fest, but with people that can move things along, it was enjoyable.

I kind of get the feeling this is a small box game that was overproduced into a big box game.  Everything seems to be unnecessarily big, and the board is completely superfluous; a giant board just to hold some piles of cards.  I can see it helping if the board actually helped group the cards into primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, but it doesn't even do that.  In fact, next time I won't be using the board so that I can just arrange the piles of colors in a logical and easy-to-find fashion, while taking up way less table space.

Unnecessary and huge components aside, this is otherwise a fun little game that seems to hit a sweet spot for being playable with the family while also being interesting for gamers, which is a nice little niche.

"8) Both of the 14 card commission card sets will be available for purchase separately, so owners of the first edition can purchase the 14 new commission cards, and owners of the new international edition can purchase the 14 commission cards from the first edition."

"The 14 "old" commission cards are only "old" in the sense that they are the same works of art that were featured in the first edition. In Expansion Set 1, these "old" works have been re-formatted to be compatible with the new International (aka Second) edition printing and Bobby is correct in that the "second edition format" does take into account the new scoring values. This Expansion Set is intended for those who buy the new International Edition (IE) and want to have another 14 commission cards to choose from for play."

Why do some people say this is similar to Fresco?! It certainly is NOT! Sure, there are paints in both games... And that's it. I like both games very much; Fresco is sort of a worker placement game, and I love WP games, but Pastiche is something a bit different. Both are great eurogames though and I'm glad that I own both as they fill different gaming niches.

In Pastiche, t's exciting to try to fit your hexagon so it will give you the desired colors you need for your paintings, and the Settlers like trading aspect is neat too, though it hasn't been a big part in the games I've played. One thing to notice is that the scores are usually very tight and there is no way you will win or lose big time which some might see as a nice plus (I don't really like it, but it's okay). I recommend this game to most people; it's great as a gateway game but also good for experienced gamers.

Card collecting/set making game with an art theme which feels a bit tacked on.

I've played Pastiche three times now, and there's something about the theme of mixing paints that I just find very enjoyable. Regarding the game play, I've won once, I've lost once... but at first I wasn't quite sure what the strategy was in the game. It makes me wonder if there's a reason why (currently) there's not a single strategy article on the game page!

Ultimately, the game comes down to smart tile laying and efficiently managing the upgrading of the colors you need. Good play is not apparently obvious to new or casual players. It works, but this might be best as a two player, as each turn requires a bit of thinking and churning of cards and color mixtures.

Update: I ultimately traded this away. Don't get me wrong, the game is gorgeous, I love the artwork tiles, I love the idea of mixing paints... but in practice there's some things left to be desired. Turns take way long, and that's exacerbated by the tedious task of mixing paint cards, and more cards, and more cards. The heart of the game is in the efficient placement of tiles to generate more paint, but it's just not interesting enough. Great game to look at, but a bit ho-hum to play.

This is an abstract, tile laying game COMBINED with a resource collection\trading\converting game.  The art theme is very strong here.  Tiles played to the growing board give a single primary color or potentially several secondary & tertiary colors.  Converting 2 paints to one is just mixing colors, in card format.  Cool!  Having a hand limit of 8 color cards also adds to the strategy.  Of course it has wonderful artwork, as the paintings used are all famous masterpieces.
CON: The constant card manipulation is WAY too fiddly.  For trade.

Art theme. International edition to be released with easels. Mixing paint colours with tile laying mechanic, set collection of paint cards, with trading element. Somewhat abstract, MENSA Award winner 2011. Said to be a good gateway game, as well as educational. Really looking forward to adding this to the library, although lately my enthusiasm has decreased a little. Expansions of more paintings available too.

I liked the concept, the theme, and the components.  But there wasn't much strategy to it.  I think in order to win, you must match artists to get the bonus points.  And that is completely luck driven.  Really, I think everyone should finish at about the same amount of points...unless they get some horrible tile draws.  The bonus points then decide the game.  Assuming more than 1 player gets the bonus points, it will likely come down to matching colors on the remaining paintings.

I wouldn't mind owning this game to play with my kids, but I can't see playing it for my strategy fix.

My first thought about Pastiche was the complication of the title. I was under the impression that this game was a light family affair. I would argue this is one of the more complicated tile laying games I've played lately. 

What impressed me about Pastiche was how such a dry, abstract mechanic, laying tiles to collect colors, turns into a fairly thematic game. I don't know if I'm looking for a heavy tile-laying game, but I'd be happy to give this title another go in the future. Fantastic components.

The box itself is excellent.  Excluding the insert it is super sturdy;  wish all board game boxes were like this.
The game itself .... like the idea .... my group stopped playing this once Fresco came to the table, and playing Pastiche again reminded me of why.  The idea is good:  collect and mix colors to paint works of art for points.  

There's just not enough substance to it.  Place the tiles - maybe you will mix the color this time, or perhaps next time.  Then put all of the colors you needed down and your done.  You can trade with the bank or others, but there's just not that much to it.  I guess I'd rate it more highly for younger players or people who don't play much, or at all.
(Have not played any of the expansions; perhaps those add missing or enhancing dimensions to the game.....)
Love the publisher, and the quality of the game.

My goodness, these components are 100% top notch! Our first game took too long as AP was a huge factor. Every turn you can try to match your colors up with any of the 6 paintings available to you, and any tile can be placed any where, and you can trade colors. Our turns took forever! Not the game's fault, I'm sure we'll speed up as we go.

*Update: 4 player game went much faster with experienced players. This game has a solid design and great theme.

My first impression was very positive. I liked just about everything about this game, but I'm not yet sure how replayable it is. I want to play it some more.

Edit: I downgraded it from 8 to 7 after playing it again. My second game suffered from the same thing as my first game: You have to be very careful and not get any extraneous cards because it will be very hard to use them. It will also help to make the exact score needed to end the game. You also need to get the bonus points for having two paintings by the same artist; it's very hard to win without this. The color is pretty fiddly. It's very easy to set up someone for a good turn if you're not paying attention. It's still a good game and I'm willing to play, but perhaps not obtain.

I feel similar about this game as Mesopotamia and Jet Set. Any distractions will prevent a win.

Edit: I gave this another chance and I like it better now. I have introduced it to some others and they really like it too. This is simpler than and easier to learn than Fresco so I now play it more. I have the International edition which has superb components.

This game has been well received by my gaming friends, even the ones who didn't think they would like it and by those who are not all that interested in art.

It is a good family game with simple rules.  It is also an excellent educational game although we were not playing it for its educational value.  Nice components, although common card stock was used, and after a couple of plays I think the cards need sleeving--because this game is going to get some play.  The box is extremely sturdy--wish my boxes were all this way.

There is strategy in laying the tiles, trading, and filling commissions.  

I am very pleased with this game and looking forward to more plays soon.

My wife's new favorite game.  It's a solid game about laying tiles to allow you to pick up cards that you collect into sets that you turn in to collect points (finish "pastiches" of the master artists' work). I would heartily recommend this to any art lovers who are also gamers.  
Pros: 
- Well above-average production quality. Including 2 easels for each player is a very nice touch.
- The theme of mixing primary colors to create secondary, and tertiary colors (and white, black, grey and basque) is strong. The mechanism of putting a tile against another tile to generate colors is pretty cool.
- There is a strong, tense feeling of racing your opponents.
Cons:
- The decisions can seem fairly straightforward much of the time.
- This would be an absolute nightmare to play with someone suffering from AP.  There is always probably one optimal spot to place a tile each turn for each player, but finding it could take several minutes.

Any game that my wife asks to play with me "just because" will have a special place in my heart, and this is one of the very few.

Combine tiles to get colours. Use colours to create paintings. Score. Okay, so that's probably not a fair characterization (even though factually correct). It does, however, convey the excitement and suspense quite well.

Pastiche is an optimization puzzle. While is has trading in the rules there is little incentive to actually use it because the paints have fixed values, and some of the placement rules simply result in nobody ever placing tiles that way because it would be much too good for the next player. Oh, and there's a start player advantage that should typically amount to at least 4 VPs but that doesn't really matter all that much at this point.

If it's the theme you're after, the painting and colour-mixing stuff has a much better implementation in Fresco.

Seems Underrated. A lot like Splendor - mixing colors instead of buying gems; combinatorial. Was tired, but seemed heavier than others say - not in the sense that there are lots of paths to victory or intricate mechanics, gameplay. However, you do have to evaluate a number of things each turn: color limit, options for placement and orientation of hex tile to get desired paints, different possible ways of mixing to obtain needed colors to work towards... which painting? And how your decision will affect others. Not "heavy", per se, but requires calculation, rather than just intuition and heuristics.

Quite simple, yet clever and enjoyable game. I suspect this one would completely fall off the radar if it wasn't covered in such a luxurious package. Component quality is really off the scale (even the box surprised me with its thickness and finishing) and gameplay manages to combine elements from the most renowned gateway games, like Carcassonne (the tile laying), Catan (the trading) and ticket to ride (the objectives). A quintessential gateway then and for me it deserves a solid 8

My astute friends claimed this to be Settlers of Catan with painting! I agree, but I like this one. Mixing paint to complete famous paintings, or even failing to complete them, is much more enjoyable better than building roads to nowhere and combining bricks with wheat or whatever. Did I mention that Pastiche is educational and approved by Mensa nerds?

In terms of fit and finish this is the best game I have ever seen.  Very sturdy box, the insert has a place for all the components. All of the components are sturdy and high quality.  The components are all ready to use out of the box, no punching, no trimming, ready to use and each in its own place within the box.  The game is relatively easy to teach.  Any gamer will "get it" in a minute.  Non gamers should "get it" after one or two turns (excluding my Mom but that is another story).  As far as the game play it is also high on my list.  You need to have a plan A and a plan B so that when your turn comes again you can proceed without delay as other players may do what you had planned. The game is not complicated but challenging due to the interactions among the players.  Players choose places to lay tiles, trade cards with each other and the bank, trade objectives (paintings) from their own reserve with those available to all.  This is one of the very few games where the players will learn something practical besides out smarting someone else.  Some gamers in my group do their level best not to learn anything from a game other than how to out wit other players.  Well, after playing this game I'm quit sure even they will know that orange results from mixing red and yellow.  A very good game that is made to very high standards, it could only be better if it were made in the USA (that is also another story)

Good concept, joining tile placement and set collection in an interesting way. The general rules are fairly simple, but with 17 different colors and most being obtained by mixing others, the game can be a bit of a brain burner and lead to analysis paralysis if played too seriously. Luck of the draw is definitely important and there is the constant possibility of setting up a good move for the next player. There is also an unmitigated turn order advantage, and I really don't understand why the game ends abruptly when a player reaches a point threshold, instead of finishing the round so that everyone has the same number of turns. But at least you score cards in hand needed for your unfinished paintings, avoiding the problem of other games in which you score only a few completed items and the winner is always the player who ended the game. Anyway, it's an enjoyable game, despite some functionality problems, like the hard-to-read names of the painters and the lack of information on the corner of the cards - not to mention the unnecessarily large board that keeps the cards (un)organized in an almost completely random fashion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's an overall 'ok' game.  While it is fun to try and trade 'up' to better point colors, I'm not sure that a) there's enough trading (and incentive to trade) and b) that there's much 'new' to the game.

But, it's still worth a few plays here and there.

Wow, I am impressed. This is a very well-designed game with very appealing artwork (although the hex tiles are less attractive than the rest and seem to be a little out of place). It can turn into a brain burner, as planning the placement of your tile, trading cards and fulfilling a commission is quite a chain of actions. Which brings me to the reason I am not too eager to try this with more than 2 players: Downtime can be long if people aren't quick thinkers. 
Still, I really enjoyed my one play (so far) of this. Play it on a large table or get the smaller edition - but I like mine. :-)

I traded for this in order to have a game my 5-year-old son would enjoy. On that count, it's a great success. He understands the colors, and vaguely gets that he needs to try to complete paintings even if he's not great at finding the most efficient routes for doing so. It's also pretty decent when it's just me and the wife, though. Stupidly large board makes it tough to bring out, though that's solved by simply stacking the cards without the board.

Sold 1st Edition Set collection game based on acquiring matching 'colour pigment' cubes. A bit dry but a reasonably good strategy game. Confusing as to the best winning approach.

Pretty & different. The palette would be arranged by card value & smaller to be useful. The tile-laying part with the color combinations was visually jarring. Paintings with multiple high value colors are much more difficult to make. The decisions involved are not intuitive, but I liked playing anyway.

I'm not color blind but I had problems with the colors, some being too close to each other... and the printed name of the color (where it's printed, the mini-play aids don't include the names on the combos) on the commissions I needed to put my readers on for :(

As the game goes on the AP also increases as the number of places and hence combinations of where to place your hex color tile obviously keeps growing.  Also trying to do in your head all the trade paths you need to get the right colors along with a hand limit makes this a much more thinky game than it appeared on the surface.

Shocked at how much fun this is.  I bought to play with my mom and sisters, thinking girls-night-out, classy game with a glass of wine (trying to appeal to even my non-gamer sisters).  My husband ends up enjoying this game as much as I do.  He requests it. We altered wood domino racks for each player's cards, tiles, and hexes.  We also found little easels for the gallery.  This makes the game spectacular!

Own the new cards.

A very unique game...northing else quite like it!

* Kickstarted! *

Place the hexagonal pallet tiles to get paint colours dependent on the way the combinations link up. Then, you can trade your colours in certain combinations for others, keeping your hand limit to a controllable ten. Finally, use the colours to match the combinations on the famous artworks' cards to win their point value. It's simple... but requires some knowledge of the colour wheel, and some of the colour combinations require multiple trades to get to.

PLUS: theme, ease of play, works as an art lesson as well as a game
MINUS: many combinations to keep in your head, goals may be harder for younger children
BONUS: the components with expansions fit into the box very nicely

NOTE: this is the petite version with smaller cards and handy easels included in the box

RATING: 5
If you play this game while you have a slight headache, this will only make it worse.

Game play is VERY similar to Sid Sackson's Bazaar. It is a game of matching combos to create sets to complete contracts (or in this game, "commissions"). Rather than direct trading with a trading key that changes every game as in Bazaar, here the key doesn't change, but you collect sets by combining colors through playing tiles rather than directly trading - although limited trading is permissible as well. The result is a game of looking closely at your tiles, looking closely at the board, and looking closely at the key. Then you play a tile and collect cards, trading them in for commissions when you have the required combos.

Simply put, if you like Bazaar, you will like this. If you hate Bazaar, there is not enough new here to win you over. I find these games to be incredibly thinky in a puzzle-kind-of-way, but without the equivalent payoff in fun. But I know some people get more fun out of this kind of thing than I. And for those who dig it, this game will do a good job of scratching that itch. And another plus, the components are top-notch.

A definite brainburner! As more and more hexs are added, the decisions get more complicated. Mapping your hand colors to the commission cards is no picnic either.

I thought this was going to be lighter than Fresco. Turns out its heavier. Both metaphorically and literally. The box weighs a ton!

I think I will enjoy this more once I get my head around the mixing options.

Very nice set collection game that shares more in common with Ticket to Ride than a cursory glance would have you believe.  Can be very thinky at times, but can also be played simply tactically.

Absolutely top notch production values.  Great, heavy tiles and quite possibly the greatest box of ANY boardgame I have ever seen.  This thing is a marvel!  Thick cardboard, with beveled edges and a textured finish.

RATING: 7
Players have cards with famous paintings which require certain colors to complete for victory points. Players place tiles containing the primary colors red, yellow and blue in which the intersection with other cards gives cards with mixtures of colors. With the colors and paintings it is a very beautiful game. It can be quite challenging though to analyze the many possible tile laying possibilities trying to find the one that will generate the colors you need. I think with a couple more plays this will get easier.

What's wrong with Gryphon that they didn't care about the huge starting player advantage in the development? It's easily remedied by a house rule to continue the round until each player had the same number of moves but it leaves me wondering what else could have become of Pastiche with a competent publisher.
As it is, it's a slowly plodding AP-inducing experience that overstays its welcome and is best played with only two players to reduce waiting time to a bearable minimum. On your move you try to solve the puzzle how to get the most adequate output out of your available resources. Rinse and repeat until game end and hope that you get lucky to grab two paintings by the same artist. Cleverly, Gryphon used classic artworks to save on their own design. Recommended only if you like solving puzzles.

My wife just loves this game. I enjoy it as well. I love the way that it borrows elements from other games while making it all unique and educational. However, I was troubled by the first 4 player game we played. The winner ultimately was the person who happened to start with a painting on their easel that matched one from the gallery. The artist bonus needs a sort of adjustment, or it should be ignored.

I know that a lot of people really like the artwork.  I guess if you're going to have a game about artwork, then having well known masterpieces is a good thing.  The problem is that the illustration style is like something you would find in a craft store, I find it awful.  And the real game pieces that you are mainly interacting with are just hexes with dabs of paint on them.  I guess mixing paint is a somewhat novel concept in games (it's more in depth here than in Fresco), but I'm not big on abstract tile laying games, especially when they are as contradictory as this one.

It seems like if you want to play the game well or win, you would be best off studying your options and carefully choosing where you place your tiles.  But at the same time, if someone is taking over 10 seconds to place their tile, the game would be absolute tedium.  So what's to be done?

[b]Pastiche[/b]: very easy rules and a good gateway game, even if it is a little too long for what it does. Next time we play we will do it with reduced points to trigger  end game. What really attracts me is the outstanding components and that you get to complete beautiful paintings. This is such a non gamer perspective, but this is what I feel. The game is just very light game, but the components and the paintings... At least we can borrow it for now, and other times too in the future.

This game has fallen to the bottom of the stack.  More of a tile placement game and not much movement in what can be done with the paintings.

RATING: 5
Collect resources (paint), then cash them in for points from commissions (paintings).  Repeat.

The paint collection mechanism is interesting, but enforces a tight left-right binding.  Commission choice is fairly random, even with the gallery, but that doesn't really matter as every painting is worth the sum of its paint.  It does mean that the availability of the artist bonuses is somewhat arbitrary as not all artists have two paintings show up.  Further, as some colors are intrinsically undervalued (bisque), some paintings are slightly better than others.

Our game (4p) took considerably too long for what the game is, but I doubt it would ever take under an hour with 4.

I'd love to play it with fast players as well. It's a rather simple "collect colored bits and change them to mission cards giving you points" game (see e.g. Charon Inc. and Cargo Noir just from the recent releases) that doesn't really have a big 'arc' or too varied play but it's a fun tile laying/combination game. I guess it is, when played in 45 minutes and not 90.

This is a set collection game with artwork from real artists.  It is an excellent game to familiarize you or your kids with artists and art.  Collect sets by placing primary color hexes on a board of colors and transform them to get other colors which allow you to satisfy color requirements for paintings.  My family calls it Ticket to Ride with paintings.  I like it a lot but it can get a bit "samey" after 10 plays or so.  But I still like it.  

Very family friendly and it is an excellent game.

I know what they were trying to do with this game and I appreciate that... I really do.  Actually playing it though?  Ick.  Zero Strategy, all tactics. If you didn't know the people playing or the game  and watched this played, you would think all the players have the worst analysis paralysis in the world.  The game forces it. On top of that, here, keep these 8 small cards, these 2 hex cardboard tiles, and these 2 oversize cardboard cards.  Oh yeah, keep them hidden and be prepared to have to analyze them all every turn.  That won't be awkward at all.

There's more to chew on in this game than I initially thought. My wife beat me like I stole something during our first game. It was intense. I would say, above all else, this is a hand-management game. You can only keep 8 cards from round to round and some of your commissions (paintings you are trying to fulfill) require 7 of those 8 colors. Not to mention, you always have 2 paintings in front of you, meaning that if you are going for a intricate/complex painting, you can only focus on one at a time. Because this game is so simple in terms of rules and gameplay, I though it would be wide open. I WAS WRONG. In order to do well at this game against a skilled player, you have to be disciplined. Interestingly, that unexpected difficulty makes me like the game better. I was worried it might be too light, but my fears have been put to bed. 

Also, it should be mentioned that this game has a phenomenal production (second edition). I'm very happy overall and look forward to more plays.

It's rather a pleasant experience, than a good game. The quality is great, the game mechanics work well on paper. In practice it's cumbersome, fell flat for us. Other than the slight tension from working around the eight card hand limit, it's a quiet puzzle with long pauses, waiting for your turn while the active player finally decides what to do with the hex-field and the colors already in hand. It's not completely hopeless, most probably will see more table-time, but mainly because it's such a nice game.

Surprised by how much I didn't like the game play of this one. I enjoy Fresco and the idea of mixing paints to make paintings, but here it's an annoying mental exercise of referencing paint charts and scanning a bunch of multi-colored splotches. Will give it another chance, just in case something clicks and I 'get' it.

RATING: 6.5
I like the color mixing idea and trying to match up the tiles to get the colors you need.  I also enjoy the fact that it uses real paintings -- we thought this would be a neat semi-educational game with the kids.  Unfortunately, the actual play just feels very drab.  There's very little interaction and there are so many options of where and how to place your tile to get colors that it's very susceptible to analysis paralysis.  I want to like this game and the component quality is excellent, but for a painting theme I think I'd rather play Fresco.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
After 3 plays. Initial impressions were a bit blah, especially the hex tile part of the game. The easels and the real paintings and the realish color mixing were cute, however.

The game doesn't have any swinginess, which gives it a plodding feel. It's annoying to have to constantly reference the color mixing guide, although if I played it often I'd memorize them and I suppose that's the educational point. 

Biggest gripe: I've come to detest the whole hex placement part of the game, which, about which there is just nothing interesting. You can't set yourself for cool moves down the line, and can only execute the tiniest modicum of defense as far as I can see. And because this incredibly boring and unthematic feature is the engine that drives the whole game, I can't give it anything but a low rating.

Quite a clever and fun game. We played with four novices (at least the owner had read the rules) and there was a lot of downtime during other player's moves.

Without some rotation mechanism for the four paintings in the middle, it seemed to be just luck whether or not you could finish two by the same artist.

Also, the theme is a bit silly in that top art restorers don't have the right paint to work on multi squillion dollar pieces. To address this we decided that we were actually forgers and every time we went out to get some paint we were delving into a dodgy underworld of paint freaks.

I think this is becoming my wife's favorite game, even though I have beaten every time but once.  She's like that though.  Intriguing multi-part system of building colors from the palette pieces, and cashing those colors in for paintings.

Another luck of the draw type of game (a la Colosseum) but with some mechanisms to mitigate a bad draw. The engine for obtaining new resources (cards) is very innovative, using the conceit of mixing colors. It kind of took a long time for the amount of game, but maybe chalk that up to a first play. The rules read like a quick game.

Amazing, stunning production quality. Big, heavy, solid cardstock complemented by over-the-top production and (naturally) brilliant art. This is probably a contender for the all-time lavishness prize.

Is there a game in there to match? Well, kinda. It won't knock your socks off, but it is a pleasant enough waste of a few minutes. Exchanging and optimising stuff for other stuff isn't terribly mould-breaking, but it [i]is[/i] a class apart when it comes to making you feel that you are playing a really high-quality game. Respect to Gryphon, surely the most extravagant publisher out there.

Mix colors and paint masterpieces.  Nice components and interesting theme.  Has a somewhat education bent to it; you learn what colors mix with what to get certain other colors; teal for example (two blues and one yellow; who knew?).  A little too much to keep in mind during the game for my seven year old, but my eleven year old really likes the game.  
The box that the game comes in has the thickest cardboard of any game I own. The box is so sturdy you could use the box to chock a car on a hill.  Not sure why of the thick box but it does contribute to a higher quality feel to the game.  Alright, I'll keep it (maybe in my car next to the snow chains).

[b]Pastiche[/b] was traded away 12/8/14 (received Asara). 

[i]- Beautiful components (love the easels) with an awesome theme.
- Tile laying to mix colors [i](although it is more limited than I thought it would be)[/i].
- Easy to teach/learn and definitely a game you could break out with more casual gamers.

All of that said I was disappointed with this game.
There really aren't that many decisions to be made, basically you lay a tile, get paints, mix paints and fulfill commissions. For a game with so few decisions I felt like it really outstayed it's welcome, I played a 3p game and it went over an hour. This game held my interest for about half that time.

There is no tension in this game which may appeal to some if you are looking for a really casual experience where you can easily talk/chill and play a game with family and friends. However that niche is already filled by other games in my collection. In fact I would highly recommend [thing=147431][/thing] which has a great art theme, beautiful components, and some added depth but still offers a relaxing game experience.[/i]

A wonderful game of creating paintings. This game is almost two games in one that you play simultaneously. There is the mechanic of completing your paintings and the puzzle type mechanic of placing tiles in the best way to collect the best paints. The box, components, and cardboard bits are really top quality. The paint board is outstanding...it's nothing but a board to hold the cards but it looks perfect with the paint cards sitting on the paint palette. A great educational game that could be used to teach basic paint colors to art students.

The only thing this game really needs is card holder stands (similar in style to the stands in the 10 Days series of games). It really is a bit tedious to keep flipping your unfinished paintings over, just to remember what paints you need to complete them.

RATING: 6
Interestingly different theming, but a warning not to play with AP'ers as this one provides so many options to collect the cards you need, so many different ways, it'll do your head in. You get some paintings you need to paint (worth VPs), and they'll say what colours you need to collect to paint them. You collect the colours by placing a hex on the board to form colour patterns that (thematically when mixed) give you the colours you need. Placing a tile so that a blue splotch is next to a red splotch will give you a purple card. Some colours require you to trade in 3 identicals for 1, and you can also trade colours with other players. There's so many different ways to lay your hexes - two hexes, each can be laid in 6 different ways in up to 20 different spots by game end, and furthermore which of your painting sets will be easiest to acquire given your hexes and the board layout. It's nigh impossible to process all options within a reasonable timeframe and ensure the most productive play. I found it more enjoyable to deliberately limit myself ... focus on one painting, focus on getting the hardest to get colour and if there's multiple ways to get there (that's easy enough to do) then choose one which'll give you a side colour or two you'll also need. The gameplay is therefore completely abstract and ain't for everyone. Despite the lower rating induced by the prospect of undue downtime, I didn't mind it because it made me process game state in a different way to other games, plus I learnt a bit about colours, plus the components are great. It's a nice feeling painting a Monet after all.

Based on one play: In order to get the right colors to complete you paintings you simply lay down on hexagon piece each turn and the collect the paints matching the combinations you created or taking the primary color on the center of your piece. When you have all the colors simply play the painting down to get the points. You get a bonus if you complete two paintings of the same artist, but often you do not see the second one at all, so some frustration there. But the game is simple and can be easily taught.

RATING: 5.5
Perfectly serviceable game, perfect for gateway gamers. The component quality is second-to-none for what it offers, but the interaction between players is at a minimum. The shoehorned trading phase doesn't increase player interaction, and since all palette cards are gained by clever placement vice luck (like Catan), I propose that it is also unnecessary. Mixing a primary color on the board is also very unlikely.

There might be a bit of analysis paralysis when picking up a location for an hexagon tile, and on the bank trade phase, but nothing too crazy. My wife loves this game so I am sure it will see plenty of table time.

Good game; very reminiscent of Monad.  You build by collecting and trading cards (cycling through primaries much as you do with the Bis in Monad) until you finally score.  Then all hell breaks loose and you start scoring every other turn and WHAM it's over.

Rule book needs tweaking (when you go out, do you get to replenish your commission card) and the layout of the mostly unnecessary board is horrible--went for artistic but should have gone for functional (put the primaries, bisque, gray, black, and white together with notes as to the special trading functions, e.g.).

(comments after a single play)

Pros:
* Very pretty and thematic.
* Easy to explain to non-gamers what you're doing with the paints and why you're collecting them.

Cons:
* For such a light game, it's easy to get AP trying to figure out where to put a hex such that it gives you the most efficient collection of colors (including something you can trade with the bank so you don't go over your limit) and doesn't setup the next player for too strong of a turn.
* The overproduction has a somewhat negative impact on setup/cleanup time. The board serves almost no functional purpose and the easels are clumsy and tip over easily. On the topic of setup, there are a lot of different colors in this game, which means lots of small piles of cards. The cards kind of stick together.
* The cards are supposed to be hidden, but the game features trading between players. It's Catan's "anyone have any sheep?" all over again, but now with over a dozen different colors ("I'll trade a violet and two bisque for a grey and a magenta. Don't have magenta? Ok, how about a green, orange and brown for purple and teal? Don't have that either? Ok, how about ..."). Given that the cards are trackable, I'll probably just play with them face up from now on.

Fun game. Between Fresco (similar theme) and dozens of other non-engine-building "get X, Y and Z to buy J" style games in my collection (e.g. Finca), I'm not sure what niche it fills. Despite having easier decisions, Finca felt less random, less fiddly and more streamlined. Light games need to be quick to setup for them to get played in my home.

Fun little abstract game of mixing paint colors and completing "commissions" of great works of art. A little more AP inducing than I would like from a lighter game like this, but not bad either and the not-overused theme gives it place in my collection if nothing else.

Nice and enjoyable family game about mixing paint and putting together some of the most well-known paintings.

A nice casual game. Love the quality of the components and style of the board. 

Scoring bonus points for finishing multiple paintings by the same artist feels too important to endgame scoring since it's based too much on luck of the draw.

Still trying to develop a better strategy for finishing paintings faster.

RATING: 7
Super casual. This is basically a game of who has the better eye. No combination of paint is worth more than any other and finished paintings score exactly what you put into them. It seems the only extra reward you get is from collecting multiple paintings by the same artist, which feels heavily based on luck of the draw. Maybe this will change in future editions. I enjoy the game, but I usually crave something with more substance.

Some interesting mechanics, but they took what is essentially a lightweight game and made parts needlessly difficult to achieve. Not complex, not intricate, not more interesting, just simply time consuming and turn wasting.  Instead of creating a gamers' game or a midweight game by doing this, they created a light weight game that feels like work. "Feels like work" is the kiss of death to a light weight game for me. 

I'd love to see this republished with white/black/grey brought more into balance.

Making sure everyone plays an equal number of turns this always turns out to be a very close affair with only a couple of points spreading the players. With all the art more or less mathematically balanced it will come down to who has managed to make the most out their hex tile placements. More often than not that's decided by the player on your right, partly by seeing opportunities for what you need at the end of the game and partly by the tiles you draw.

As a light family game it keeps the kids engrossed. The art is a good topic for everyone. A perfectly respectable game, but not really engrossing. Just as a family game it probably deserves a better rating than I'm giving it, but for my taste it's just not a good enough game to keep me interested.

Pastiche (Multilingual second 2011 International edition) --

It took me about half of my first game to wrap my head around the conversions.  In my next game, I had just as much trouble.

Had the player's aid used clearer iconography, my confusion could have been prevented. The player's aid showed dabs of color equaling combinations of other dabs. If those dabs had been in hexes for certain conversions and in card-shapes for others, it all would have been clearer.

Once I grasped the way things worked, I liked it.  The art is beautiful, the production quality is top-notch, and the play itself is good but not great.  A bit too much "conversion soup" for my taste.

A tile-laying, set-collection game with an art theme. Interesting, kind of; but not really so much -- there's nothing new here, and the game seems to go on a bit too long. Paintings are worth exactly the sum of the paints, so it's not necessarily horrible not being able to finish; at least you'll still get the VP for the paints. But the artist bonus seems kind of random since your initial hand of paintings is random. Also, I don't know my colors and it was annoying to constantly have to consult the helper card to figure out what I needed to do to get the colors I needed, or what paint card I'd be collecting based on where I placed my hex. Also, the game is fiddly -- a lot to juggle (your paintings, hexes, and paint cards)! We ended up using racks from the 10 Days in ___ series, which worked reasonably well.

Neat idea, sounded better when I was listening to the rules then it turned out to be. Would play it again, but won't be seeking it out.

--- Summary ---
Players start with 2 paintings, each requiring a different combination of colors to finish (and worth different VP, depending on difficulty). Several paintings are also face up in a display. Players will be laying tiles (hexes with color swatches on the corners, and one in the center) to create color combinations -- take a card representing the color created. Alternatively, take only a single primary color (primaries are the most difficult to acquire) -- the color in the center of the hex just played. May trade freely with other players. Then turn in sets of color cards to complete a painting (one of yours in hand, or one of the ones on Display). If finishing a painting from your hand, take a replacement from the Display. On your turn, may also trade paintings from hand to Display. May only have 8 paints in hand at the end of your turn.

The game ends when anyone finishes paintings worth at least 35VP. Everyone may then play paints from hand that would work towards completing any of their remaining paintings. Finally, bonus VP are awarded to players with more than one painting from the same artist (bonus increases if more difficult paintings were completed). The player with the most VP wins.

There are so many color combinations to figure out and so many possibilities with the tiles that it's almost too much.  A neat idea and nice components, plus I enjoy learning the color combos and seeing the classic paintings.  Too complicated to be much of a family game.

RATING: 6
I loved the theme of collecting the correct paint colors via tile laying in order to paint these masterpieces. The player aid was very helpful for remembering how to make all the colors. Also, this game has great component quality between the the easels and really thick cardboard. 

Overall, the game fell flat. I didn't see much purpose in trading colors with the other player, though I played 2 player, so maybe this would be different in a 3+ player game. I prefer the game Lanterns, which has a similar tile laying mechanism, but it is much easier to remember, which colors you are collecting and you don't have to spend the entire game referencing the player aid.

Gorgeous. Excellent rule book, smacks of quality production through out. Fine first effort.

Apart from the tile laying part of the game this is just another convert stuff into other stuff which might convert into other stuff which gets you the VP prize. At least its not wood and clay.

The rating would be 4 but for the tile laying get Tertiary colour part, and the prod. values

Its uncomfortably aimed at the family market, there being too many paint shades for causal gamers but not enough interesting mechanics for gamers.

A very fun color based game that combines a lot of mechanics in a very fluid way. You choose paintings, draw tiles and lay them to create certain colors, and must manage your hand to paint the paintings you chose. A true brain bender the first time you play it, it starts to click and all the mechanics come together.

We are used to thinking of a game like this as a "contract fulfillment" game.  Another way of looking at it is a "recipe game."  You have a couple of contracts, or recipes, and you have to come up with the stuff -- gems, goods, whatever, in this case colors of paint -- in the right combination to complete the recipe.  There are always rules about how you collect the stuff.  In Pastiche there are rules about how you upgrade your stuff through prescribed exchanges, like black and white to make gray.  Nevertheless, this is an acutely streamlined version of this kind of game, half the time of Silberzwerg.

Heh I forgot I've played it once. Gorgeous components (dare to say: overproduced!) but aparently game left short-lasting impression… While the game is excellent from the artistic side and can teach you something about art, it has quite simple gameplay.

Fair gateway game, much lighter than Fresco. Great components (thick card) and artwork on commissions. 

Suffers from occassional AP because there are too many choices on placing hex tile and keeping the hand limit to 8. 

A little too abstract. Recommend making an announcement when a commission is about to be completed to add more theme to the game. 

Also recommend using completion bonus variant.

Looks & feels superb. Great production values. The owner of the copy I played had added gorgeous little wooden stands for the artworks.

Unfortunately, the gameplay didn’t live up to the visual & tactile first impressions: it just felt obvious how to play, and I won easily. So … either completely luck based or blindingly obvious. Either way, I'd play it again but probably wouldn't suggest it.

RATING: 7
Another game that my daughter favours and don't mind playing this as 2 player though will bog down with a bit of AP if more 3 or more due to the placement of the tile and subsequent trading of cards to get the colours you need for the paintings. It is very educational with full names and titles of the various paintings.

RATING: 6.5
Pastiche is unquestionably one of the nicest looking games I've ever played.  It's gorgeous to behold and is made of really nice materials.  

The game itself is a very simple puzzle game.  There's not a lot of interaction to be spoken for and in fact it's  basically non-existant.  That's okay because this game works perfectly.  We find that it presents a really tough challenge as you try to optimize every tile you place.  It can be a bit AP-prone sometimes, but you just need to encourage the other players to plan their moves on your turn.

Its a 6.5 after our first play and I think it will go up as the play length decreases.

A lot of this game seemed to happen on autopilot. The placing of tiles didn't require a lot of thought, the trading with the bank was automatic and the trading with other players was basically non existent.

As such it seemed like the only deciding factor was the luck of drawing the right commissions at the right time and perhaps the decision space as to abandon a commission and trade for a new one. Perhaps Pastiche just isn't for me.

I enjoy the theme and components. Very educational, especially for people interested in art. 

This one can be tough if someone has AP. There are just so many combinations. Also, a very competitive crowd can stifle any trading/interaction. When that happens its like sitting at a table doing your own puzzle but only when everyone else has finally taken their turn.

This game has charm. The box and the bits are extremely high quality, and looking at the art is fun.

But playing the game feels like running a minimax algorithm. Mostly you're just trying to waste the fewest cards by optimizing your tile placement so you can get a set of cards you can trade with the bank. Occasionally you'll trade with other players, but not often.

I wish it was more about player trading and transforming colors into other colors, but that's just not the kind of game it is. It's fun, but each game feels similar, which limits how often you can bring it out before it gets boring.

There's something about the concept of mixing paint that creates permutation vapor lock, and Pastiche is no exception.  Everything about the game works beautifully, except for the hex board. There are too many choices available, and brain burn feels silly for such a light theme.  The components are gorgeous, yet there's too much you're supposed to hide.  Wait for the 2nd Edition, which will come with easels.  Meanwhile, my search continues for the world-altering paint game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Beautiful to look at, sooo drab to play. This one is the embodiment of a multiplayer puzzle and the trading doesn't detract from this insight. It's very shallow and very random. You cannot possibly take into account everything your opponents would do and thus mess with their plans, because if you'd want to, each turn would last 15 minutes/player.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
My main problem here is that there is just a really slow build for several turns, you finally buy a painting, then you start over again for another really slow, multi-turn build to buy another painting. It's like Splendor but without the engine-building aspect, so it just feels too slow. The tile placement part, where you collect your paints, also seems out of place. It's like a tacked-on abstract game and it's too open-ended. I haven't yet played Scoville, but it seems like they improved on that part by letting you move around a field to collect your peppers.

This game isn't terrible, but if I want a painting-themed game I would rather play Fresco, and if I want a game with a similar feel I would much rather play Century.

A much less mechanic-heavy colour mixing game than Fresco. Basically an efficiency race to get the necessary colours (via a really cute tile-placement-mixing mechanic) to complete available paintings. The trick is deciding which of the widely-differnet-difficulty available paintings you should be heading for.

Can get bogged down in AP with more players if they are being too serious, but a great 2p game.

RATING: 7
Pastiche has players placing paint dabs in an ever growing central board the players create.  This nets them colors by the intersection of the paint dabs.  This creates an interesting balance between quantity and accuracy.  

4 plays with 2 players.  Its a nice solid games with some quirkiness.  I felt a nice sense of progression as I moved from three of a basic color to trade in for white, then later trade to gray.  The 8 card limit makes the game, as you need to manage the proper path to reach the colors you need.  

We played as the illustration in the rulebook shows the color cards and the palette tiles are open information, and the dealt face down.  It turns out, this was due to vagueness in the wording but I think we'll continue to play this way.  Keeping the two face down seems like it would be noticeably worse as juggling three hands seems awkward, and having a vision of what your opponent may do adds decision points and mild speculation. (i.e. if he/she has two tiles with mostly red, you can have some idea of which artwork to pursue based upon that knowledge).  Plus, we didn't see the possibility for cutthroat competition since it was impossible to know which painting the other was pursuing. 

It was interactive in the sense, we had to interact with each others tiles and we could leave easy spots for the other player to receive a big payday, but outside of that our style was what someone would incorrectly call "multiplayer solitaire".  If you read my game comments, you'll see I like games in which people incorrectly call "multiplayer solitaire" so ultimately the previous phrase means I like it.  

My girlfriend is waaaay better than this at me, so its one of those games I dont know how much strategy is there because I am not sure I see it.  Regardless, I'm glad I bought this game because it will make an outstanding gatewayish second gateway game, its a game of nice depth and length for a relaxing but serious two player game. The end game scoring makes the game less of a race towards X points, which is a plus. The artwork is gorgeous and truly adds to the enjoyment of playing.  

Its an efficiency game without an engine.  The game length is perfect, and thats always a plus.

The rulebook is quite slim (always a plus) and the theme tie-in to the rules is quite strong.  This is a game which should have no troubles regularly finding itself on the table.

I have only played with two players, but I think I like will like it the most at that number.  It essentially eliminates the trading (a plus by me, I really dislike negotiation in games) and it adds a touch of adding double primary spots as a weapon in your arsenal.  

This has quickly become my girlfriend's favorite.  She is thinking of buying her own copy because she likes it so much.

It's a family game I probably overrate due to the success I have had with non gamers and light gamers.

I like this game a lot more than my rating would suggest. However when I read the rules about game ending I was concerned about how it ends. Not sure what is best, to end the game or to collect as many cards as you can that match and let someone else end the game when you are close to the points needed to win. Perhaps that's part of the strategy too. Perhaps it needs more plays to figure that out. I'd also say that this is NOT a 40 min. game. 60 at the best but that's going to be after everyone involved is use to the game. 75 to 90 is probably a good setting point for the game length.

While I like this game, there are a lot of little things that bug me on this game.  First, being dealt matching paintings, or having an available match in the public pool is a big advantage.  It's not likely that everyone gets that bonus.  Second, I'm not sure that the higher valued paintings necessarily pay off.  Being able to finish a couple cheap paintings quicker seems like it might be an easier win.  Third the red/blue/yellow hex tiles are so monotonous.  It's such an ugly board.  If there were electronic tiles that would automatically change colors when placed, and that would allow you to quickly try several spots and see what colors you'd get, my rating would probably jump a point immediately and I'd be tempted to buy the game.

A World of Beautiful Colors comes alive as players choose commission cards picturing 34 of the finest European art works of the past six centuries. Players score their commissions by mixing primary colors through clever tile placement, and recreating the palette of colors used by the masters who created these works. Explore the paintings, palettes, and pasts of the artists in this unique and challenging game for the whole family.

While placing hexagonal pieces to gain palette (color) cards, players become familiar with the different color combinations that produce the many hues of an artist’s palette, all listed on the Player Reference Card. Players also learn to recognize many great artists and their works as they complete commissions.

A clever mix of ticket to ride and settlers of catan. The mixing paint mechanic is neat. I think the bonus points for completing two artists of the same name is somewhat random, but you could always play without it.

However, the game has too much downtime between player turns and goes on longer than it feels like it should. I player with four players, however. It would probably be better with two (although that also reduces the opportunities for trading).

As expected, my wife loves it. So that's a win.

I wish there was a bit more liveliness in the system (explicit luck, some means of generating "mega turns" from particular hex plays, etc.), as it feels a bit on rails, where it's hard to do anything too good or too bad. Our finishes so far have all been tie-breaks or 1-point differences.

Also, seating order matters. Careless moves can easily hand the game to the LHO. So in "mixed" groups (kids and adults, a market this is aimed at), you have to referee the kids, something truly good family games don't require.

A very good first impression for Pastiche thanks to its unique art game type and good sense in gameplay.

Great way to learn colors (and painters if you really want to).  Components are of fantastic quality.  The game presents some possibility for analysis paralysis as you consider tile placement to get the best color options, otherwise the game is very smooth, lightweight, and fast.  Player interaction is possible but seems to be useless most of the time.  Getting the right paint colors sometimes takes several turns, making the game feel more like work than fun.  I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't want to play it very often.

Simple mechanics easy to learn:
- place tile to mix primary colors
- collect paint based on the mix from the tile you placed
- trade/mix paint for more colors
- complete paintings

This is significantly more difficult that I would have guessed.  I definitely need to consider making player trays to hold 2 commissions, 2 hexagonal tiles, and 8+ little cards.  I like the game, though.  It is surprising at first to realize that secondary and tertiary colors are the easiest to get, while primaries are harder to acquire.  Fortunately, the cards have point values that suggest it's the case.

The manufacturing on this first edition is astounding.  The game weighed a ton, so I assumed there were a bunch of punchboards for the the hexes.  Wrong.  The hexes are already separate, and bagged nicely.  The commission cards are actually huge (3⅝"×4⅛"), thick (2mm) tiles.  The board and box are thick and sturdy, and the board lies perfectly, seamlessly flat on the first go.  There is even a box insert, perfectly designed to hold all the "decks", with finger holes on both sides of each deck.  You certainly get your money's worth in production value!

This edition even includes the [b]easels[/b] we all wanted, as well as new commissions!*  There is even a box insert, perfectly designed to hold all the "decks" and the easel tray, with finger holes on both sides of each deck.  You certainly get your money's worth in production value!

[size=8]* Don't worry.  [company=8405][/company] beautifully offers the unique first edition stuff for sale separately for owners of the second edition, and the unique second edition stuff for owners of the first.[/size]

Una agradable sorpresa, divertido, sobreproducido, con una tematica que gusta, quiza un poco subido de precio

After 1 Play: Decisions were boring - all gaining a slight edge and no creative play, and only minimal interaction between players.

Great game.  Some of the prettiest components ever in a game!

Super beautiful components. Real art on thick coaster tiles. Chaotic and lots of admin work

This was a given for my wife, who is a painter.  Turns out, it's a really great, quick game with a nice mix of hand management, set collection, and turn optimization.  And there's definitely something to the strategy of holding back completing a commission that would trigger the end game in order to score two commissions. Though, now that I type that, may not be legal.

Don't really get the hype on this one. Components are great of course, that box is just awesome! But the game feels very solitaire and samey to me.

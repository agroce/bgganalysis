I think that I might appreciate Bohnanza if I played with a bunch of cutthroat jerks, but it only seems to get played by nice people - resulting in a game that is not any fun.

Makes a neat game for *certain* situations and falls short the rest of the time; I want to negotiate, but I'm dealing with people who have difficulty lying or obfuscating their desires. Another is if I have sufficient players as I think this is best around 5 (enough to create an unpleasant situation, but not enough so you get stuck somewhere). If you can get players who are all aggressive in their negotiations or manipulative in terms of markets/incentives, then the game is a big 8. When you have a group who are more about manipulating each other to their benefit and less about just optimizing their own fields, the game *really* shines. The problem is that to make that happen is once in a blue moon or at least erratically infrequent. Some neat calculations in terms of card counting and the three reshuffles in that you'll see some information, but not all of what's come up and is being held. The "you can't rearrange your hand" is both the most infuriating aspect of the game, and the one that drives it (and in particular, the negotiation phase) forward; suddenly giving away cards or doing lopsided trades make sense if it moves cards out of your hand. Combining that with the initial planting allows you to manipulate and incentivize transactions. I rarely turn down a game if it looks like there are a bunch of folks, but I can't think of a time when I've ever suggested it. Under perfect conditions, an 8, more likely to be a strong 6.

RATING: 9
Another excellent game if people are prepared to get involoved and fight for the win. This is a game which doesn't do too much  in terms of making things happen but instead says to the players - the quality of your gaming experience depends on you - the more ruthless the players the better the game will be. Play nice and you might as well watch paint dry or play monopoly.

Ehhh.  this one did not really pique my interest.  The ability to "donate" cards from your hand makes the order restriction a lot less painful.  Buying the 3rd field seems absolutely critical.  There is a lot of card counting involved (how many cocoa beans have been cashed in..?).

Set collection and trading game with an odd but fun theme.

Gameplay is simple: plant, trade, and pick up, with the goal of getting the most money at the game's end.  Along the way, there are tons of opportunities for trading/negotiation.  Fixed order of cards in hand is what drives alot of the trading, and is something that new players have to be mindful of. 

This is a very light, but very good gateway game (filler material) that works very well with 3-5 players.  Everyone that I've introduced it to loves it, with many rushing out to get their own copies.  An excellent way to introduce one of the greatest concepts in Euro gaming: having something to to (i.e.: trade) when it's not your turn.

Most games end up being extremely close so even when you lose, you don't feel bad.  Definitely a wife-friendly game as well.

RATING: 6
While the trading can be fun, I feel a bit constrained by the fact that at any given time you're essentially going for 2 or three kinds of beans at most. I much prefer Zaubercocktail, which has much more furious trading, with each round followed by a bit of high stakes blind bidding based on how well you traded.

Verdict: Dad's Old Fashioned Root Beer

I just can't seem to get this to the table. It must be the hand-play mechanic (not being able to change the order of your cards). I don't know what it is about this... I hear all about how this is a fine game with wonderfully designed mechanics, but it loses me.

I'll keep trying though... I don't give up easily.

What fun to have perspective. I first played Bohnanza the first summer I reentered boardgaming full throttle. It was not for me, at first. Only two plays though and I was unaccustomed to various game mechanics beyond wargaming, Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne in 2007. Nearly five years later this game was great fun and is easy to appreciate. In 2007, I had rated the game a 6. What fun to upgrade a number significantly higher.

Fun little game that many people seem to really like.  Very light, pretty random.  Is a fun game, can get old quick though.  Really just a filler that leaves you wanting something meatier.

This game is small, simple but it is great fun. I've never seen a game like this one: it awakes the "carpet seller" who sleeps deep inside me. The game mechanic forces players to negociate and accept compromises. In 45mn, you have a really good time even if victory is difficult to predict. An excellent game which probably fitsto be in any game library.

Excellent quick and easy game with the right crowd.  A great concept where cards in hand are required to be "planted" in order, thus incentivizing trades to remove unwanted cards (or wanted cards in the wrong position) from one's hand--but suffers from the same problem as all trade-dependent games:  less fun with people who will only strike a deal that is heavily weighted in their favor or people who will give the farm away on charity.  This latter point particularly manifests itself in couples play.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I enjoyed Bohnanza far more that I though I would. The reason might be that this game never caught my eye because of it artwork... I simply HATE IT! I cannot stand how ugly this game looks. Yet, when I tried it, it was a very enjoyable experience.

While a couple of mechanisms are a bit counterintuitive at first, Bohnanza packs a decent amount of game-play for such a small product. I especially enjoy the fact that there's a healthy dose of interaction. You cannot attack the players at the table, but the possibility of trading cards with them keeps you engaged... even if it's not your turn and even if you're playing with a lot of people.

So... while it's not a game I would buy for myself, it's definitively one I would play again. It's simple, it's fast, it's fun and it plays a crowd. If only it wasn't so ugly...

Grow and harvest beans for gold in this card game. Very interactive, involving a lot of trading amongst players. Easy to learn and play.

Two-player rule variant is including in the instruction booklet.

RATING: 6
In this game, I realize I'm a loud-mouthed gamer. I constantly want to maximize my profits and will gain Analysis Paralysis with a "hmm haww" when the stars don't align. This delay is worse in a negotiation game like this or Catan; I spend an inordinate amount of time trying to convince people to trade with me. Luckily, it usually works out because people just want to have fun and may be less invested in the outcome of the game. Note that in social deduction games, I am usually very suspicious because people can not guess what I'm thinking, even when I try to be explicit.
 Con: I think Bohnanza lasts longer than it should

Finally logged a few plays of Bohnanza - it's simply ok. Very plain/ugly cards, very plain game play, nothing really interesting or exciting about it. I'd play it again as a filler... but I'll also enjoy researching and buying random filler games in a quest for another easy-to-play, easy-to-teach filler.

UPDATE 1: After catching myself wanting to play this over other similar games (such as Oltremare), this one is a keeper. Not particularly fond of the artwork, so if I can find something nicer, this gets the boot! UPDATE 2: The reason that this one is saved from the get-rid-of pile is because my husband likes it as a light-weight game.

Juego de cartas para mínimo 3 jugadores, de negociación. Divertido sobre todo para el que mira la partida y no sabe jugar, el juego consiste en negociar con judías con extraños nombres, para plantarlas y sacar puntos.

Here's the deal with this game, it's great. The mathematics of it are extremely interesting. It can handle bigger groups extremely well. This is the game that I pull out when my family wants to play something during the holidays. It's hard to find short and fun games that handle large groups of people, but everyone I've introduced this to has loved it.

The secret is that this game can be knocked out in an hour or so, but usually it lasts longer. Why? Well, the nature of this game is trading and negotiation. This is the game that you bring out when you want to get people talking face to face. It's especially good with some drinks too because people are able to lighten up and get into the wheeling and dealing of this game.

I like this game; it's fun. A good game, but not a great one. And, oooohhhhh, how it can drag on! Frankly, if I had my choice of card games, I'd choose Coloretto. Now that the negative is totally out of the way, a MAJOR positive: in terms of player interaction, Bohnanza can't be beat! Settlers of Catan I certainly prefer, but SOLELY in terms of interaction, Bohnanza is far, far, superior. And, if I was only rating Bohnanza on player interaction, I would have given it a 9.

RATING: 7
Very social game. Even though the game can be played in a cut-throat manner, at least my group usually forgets about this aspect. Works great as a family or gateway game as the rules are quite easy if explained. I played with some of the expansion rules, and it makes a decent game pretty good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Not only is this game 100% social interaction (the outcome really ONLY depends on well-disposed the others are towards you), but it also commits one of the biggest sins in game design in my opinion: having a hand of cards that you MAY NOT REORDER.  Waaaaah.

Very simple, but fun game.  Probably the most fun "simple" card game I have played.  You lay cards down into stacks of the same type, and pick them up for points.  One unique thing about the game is that you have to play the cards in your hand in the order they were handed to you.  The only way to get past this is by trading cards to other players.  It is pretty fun trying to get the cards in the right order, and trying to make beneficial trades with everyone else in order to accomplish a better bean field for yourself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Set collection game with a wonderful mechanic that forces trades.  It's a bit like trading resources in Catan except those shy players are forced to make deals at least a few times a turn.  I think 5-6 players might be the sweet spot, but there isn't all that much down time if you play with larger groups.  This has potential to be one of my all-time favorites.

2-7(5)

This is one that resonates with a lot of players, and it can play a big group. All good things. It's easy to miss or confuse some of the rules. First that you HAVE to plant any of the revealed cards that you don't ditch and second that you HAVE to harvest a multibean field before a single bean one. After that, who knows what else we'll get wrong? The rationale for the rules makes sense, but it reduces the simplicity a bit.

There's a good bit of interesting planning involved in that you need to settle your hand before your turn comes back around, and too often people are too hesitant to trade unless it's their turn. The point of the game is to trade goods! A lot! It's fun and light to match the theme.

Only issues are that hand sizes seem to generally go down and small hands stifle trading and going through the deck three times sometimes feels a bit long.

It contradicts with what I usually like in games. It has a lot of chaos, luck, and depends on the will of the other players, that is very subjective, and change from game to game. But still, I like it.

Most fun if players do not attempt to put precise values on trade offers; good mechanic for forcing players to engage in trading, but even so, some players are more active traders than others.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Plant bean cards onto the table in your fields, but do so in hand order (no shuffling or re-ordering!). Wheel and deal with your opponents so that you can trade their beans into your fields and sell them off to make big profits. Beans which are more plentiful are worth less while scare beans are worth more. You play through the draw deck a few times, with scored beans exiting the game permanently, then the game is over. Low rules complexity brings out a very powerful player meta which drives the game. 

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
I've never played a game that takes place so much more above the table than on it, in terms of interaction. This game brings out your inner snake oil salesman and really encourages sharp dealing with the other players. "Look, I know that trading you my two wax beans is not the same value as your single soy bean, but you're going to be forced to plant that soy bean against your wishes next turn, and that guy over there wants a one-for-one deal on wax to soy! That's nuts. He's taking you for a ride. If you want, I'll throw in a bean of my choosing next turn to sweeten the deal."

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
This game doesn't necessarily fall apart with purely analytical players, but if the game is played too coldly, the spirit (and interesting interactions) can dissipate quickly.

I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about with this game.  I find bean and fart joke humour, pointless and infantile, so none of that struck a chord with me.  Tried a two-player game, but it just didn't gel.  Being a card player, I found it very difficult to not reorder my hand.  Traded away

This is a fun, chaotic game depending on the personalities of the players. Your turn involves proposing card trades with other players until you decide you don't want to trade anymore (or until the other players get fed up and plead with you to stop trying to trade)... which can drive me nuts when playing with my good-natured, roudy family. But, in all honesty, it's a good time. Just don't play this if you have a headache already. I complain and whine every time someone in my family suggests playing it. But, in reality, it's a great memory-maker and can be a blast. The rules and game-play are much different for just 2-players and not as fun. I think it's best with at least 4 players.

An amusing card game themed on growing several varieties of beans and selling sets. Based on a single 2-player game, probably better with more as the trading element comes in. Edit - played with 5 today, the trading element adds a lot so rating upped a wee bit.

There must be some deep psychological reason why this works so well.  I think it's because you can make deals which feel so attractive to both players, which in turn is because the rules are designed to prevent anything close to an efficient market from emerging.

RATING: 5
This is a pretty decent card game for families. Certain people in my family don’t enjoy it and will never go near the game again but others do and love it. I wouldn’t play with less than five but then again some may enjoy it none the less. I would have to say it depends on the group your playing with whether this takes off and you’d need at least two ‘characters’ giving it the spiel to make the game work. Anyone who’s playing this and doesn’t like the game can seriously damage the atmosphere. For the right people though this is a good game.

An old favourite, Bohnanza is generally a hit every time it comes out.
I love the learning curve everyone experiences when they get into this game the first time, where you simply cannot understand the economics at play.  But then people gain their own valuations and the whole thing evolves beautifully.  It's sort of a bonus that this game is so easy to teach.

My first two plays were with 4-22 range of cards and my last play was with 4-20. Shorter is much better. The game is really unique and it achieves to take one cool mechanic and build a simple and entertaining game out of it. Looking forward for more plays.

As I begin to understand how to play Bohnanza, it gets more and more enjoyable. 6 and 7 players does not sound bad at all, I'd like to try it more at this player count.

I bought this game as a bit of a punt as I was looking for a game that was easily accessible for a variety of personalities and could handle a decent number of players.

I have introduced this to loads of my friends and everyone has loved it! Even though I have a number of other more expensive and more sophisticated games, this is the one my friends seem most keen on playing!

The game is simple to grasp (once you've read over the rules), and that makes it easy for people to engage with. At the same time, for people like myself that like a bit of strategy in a game rather than relying on luck, there is enough opportunity for that to keep me engaged whilst also engaging people that would run a mile from a heavy strategy game!

Bohnanza was an endlessly entertaining Sunday brunch staple for my group of friends, back when it first came out. It brought us many hours of delightful bean-planting-and-harvesting. Ah, nostalgia... 

I still enjoy the artwork and the puns (though admittedly, the game is "punnier" in German). However, now that I'm familiar with more complex games, I find Bohnanza a bit too simple for my taste. I'd consider it a great entry choice for people who like to think and plan ahead a little during a game. 

I probably would have given this an 8 or 9 a few years ago. But I'm giving it a 4.5, because I wouldn't want to play it again.

There doesn't seem to be any real skill in this game. You just play the cards as they come to you. My youngest daughter seems to like it though and even my wife says it is OK.

Not a bad game, just not really my thing.  It's got some interesting strategy- trading to not only get you further along, but also to make your next turns more effective.  Some of the expansions look interesting, so I'd probably give this game a few more gos.

PROS:
*) It's quite an easy game to get into for new players
*) Lots of player interactions - mostly in a quite friendly manner
*) Very popular with people who don't usually play games

CONS:
*) Nothing to do with the game, really - but I'm a little sick of it from too many plays.

this was one of my first gateway games, and i liked it a lot.  it seemed to get worse with every replay though.  i've seen it die when trying to introduce non-gamers because of the forced actions and ban on hand arrangement, prompting question after question each round.  tried it 6p with a gamer's group and it went over like a lead balloon.  i'd still replay it, but i sent my copy off to greener pastures.  i'm certainly thankful for the role it played in my introduction to this kind of gaming, though.

I'm really unsure what to make of this. I liked it just fine, but wasn't crazy about it... and then read you're supposed to go through the deck [i]three times[/i]. Honestly?

Much better with 6. A little irritating with 7, mostly because people were so pleased with their ability to make deals that there wasn't any forcing people to plant beans they didn't want, and that kind of hurt the discard pile. Still, an okay filler, but not world-shattering or a favorite by any means.

The best trading game ever. This one completely surpasses even other excellent trading games such as the Settlers of Catan family.

Plus, it's low price make it a must for everyone.

Хорошая лайтовая карточная игра, правила обьясняются на пальцах за 5 минут и можно играть. через партию новички способны вполне осмысленно играть. Еще одна хорошая игра для игры с неофитами. Или для разрядки после партиии в ту же ГП когда мозги кипят после просчета маршрутов.

To quote a fellow player: "it is amazing how much fun this game is, considering how obtuse the mechanics are."  Normally obtuse mechanics are just a pain, but they take this game from a silly novelty to a satisfying experience that is also a lot of fun.

RATING: 8
Fun filler and great introductory game for non-gamers. It can get a little nasty in the more cut-throat groups but that's probably an rarity. The game can also devolve in the later stages if people trade too much and are left with no cards. Still, a great introductory trading game.

Excellent resource planning and trading game that's a blast every time I've played it. You make trades with other players to try and plant as many of the same types of bean in your two fields as possible, before selling them off for gold. A lot more fun than it sounds, and the theme is actually quite engaging.

A bit of an acquired taste, but definitely worth a go.

UPDATE (10/24/06):
I find the game not exciting.  It feels like your choices are very limited.  You really just try to get rid of your cards because keeping them is very detrimental to you.  So you just give theem to whoever wants them.  No real decisions to make.  Just bland.

As a beer-and-pretzels game it's ok, otherwise (without beer) I wouldn't be very eager to play it. It's supposed to be a negotiation game but in reality there's not much negotiations here - you trade unwanted beans for whatever is given to you because otherwise you'll give them for free, just to get rid of them.

Thought this is still one of the best game where is a quite a bit of player interaction since you need to trade or plant beans that are revealed in the second step. Very neat game with very little down time since you need to see what others are planting and what is available for donation.

Been a while since we last played the game so need quick refreshers so going to add the quick rules,

1. 3rd field cost 3 gold.
2. 1st action is to plant 1st bean and 2nd bean (optional).
3. 2nd action is to draw TWO cards and trade/donate them, failure to do so requires the current player to plant them.
4. 3rd action is to draw 3 cards and add to the back of the deck.

Was a good game and have to remember that this caters to up to 7 players!

Initial Impression: I have mixed feelings about this game. It can be great but with the right people and situation.

A superior game that's lots of fun. We play it often.

We learned it as a 2-player and still play that version a lot. Some players don't like this "Bean Duel", but almost all of our games are close, with the winner having 1 or 2 coins more which makes for an interesting experience. If you like games like this, you'll like the 2-player version.

We also like it with more than 2. That version has lots of player interaction which is enjoyable. The bartering and trading can be very competitive.

Bohnanza is really two very different games in one, and both are fun! Highly recommended.

Add the Buildings variant from High Bohn Plus for a game with more decisions. 

NOTE: Check out my player aid "Two Player Turn Order" in the the Bohnanza FILES section.

I was undecided for a long time, but then I realized this was all about card counting (and trading).  Unless your group likes card counging, I would suggest removing the next biggest set of beans than the rules suggest...therefore both shortening the game and making it easier for people to count the beans that have been played.

One of the earliest game that lead me to this hobby after Acquire. Good gateway trading game. I liked it a lot and played it a lot but fun factor has been faded out since.

Decent family game for it can support up to 7 players.  However, I would never consider playing this with gamers, for it's nothing more than an entry-level game that features trading randomly distributed resources, which I normally hate to do.

I really like this game, but whenever I bring it up, I get looks of prune-faced disapproval in return.  I don't know why my particular group dislikes it so.  It's highly rated, and I can see why.  Choosing when to start new fields or hang on for the big score, the interaction of trading cards, and the great card art are all bonuses in my book.  I've owned this for nearly two years now, and only gotten to play 3-4 times total.  No sense picking up the expansions if no one will play the base game with me.  [Market price]

[i]Posted: 2/12/06, Rated: 7[/i]

[i]Bohnanza[/i] is a fun little game, that takes a different view on set-collection, and introduces a new mechanic to card games with which I have not yet played.

You can only collect two sets at a time (later in the game, you have the opportunity to expand this number to three).  At the beginning of your turn, you [i]must[/i] plant the first card in your hand, which means you may have to harvest a bean "field" in order to make room, often before you would have liked to do so.  This limiting mechanic is a fun addition that creates tough decisions: do I take the easy, one coin from a field now?  Or do I hold on to those beans, hoping they will earn more later, and instead harvest my second field which doesn't yet have enough beans to earn anything?

The "first card in your hand" is easy to determine because you must play your cards in the order in which you drew them.  You may not adjust the order of the cards in your hand.  This is a new idea, and I really like it.  This card order often influences your play in the current turn: you could plant two beans of the same type now, or you could hold on to that second one because you think you will be able to play it as the first card in your next turn.  Of course, you may end up trading for other beans before the start of your next turn, have to harvest that very bean field, and then that first card is an albatross around your neck.

Trading and haggling are also a vital part of [i]Bohnanza,[/i] and in my opinion that kind of interactivity always enhances a game.  [i]Bohnanza[/i] plays well from two to four players.  The box says it goes up to seven, but I haven't tried any more than four yet.  The two player variant is different enough to allow for longer-range planning, which I enjoy.  Lastly, the whimsical artwork on the cards has been well-received by my two sons, ages seven and five, who enjoy playing as well.  A solid, lightweight game for the family!

[i]Updated: 1/4/08, Rated: 7[/i]

Re-asserting my original rating of "7."  This game is still a lot of fun.  My sons are shrewder in their trades now, which makes the experience more interesting.  I'd bump it to an "8," but longevity alone is not enough to warrant the increase.

[i]Updated: 8/9/10, Rated: 8[/i]
{2P: 5, 3P: 7, 4P: 8, 5P: 9, 6P: ?, 7P: ?}

Have we really been playing this game for four years?  The answer is "yes."  Like a fine wine, [i]Bohnanza[/i] has gotten better with age.  Not my cards, unfortunately, and my wife tells me that she will refuse to play this game if I sleeve it!

I think we've finally reached a level of expertise where the game has fully opened up.  Ironically, it is still usually in your best interest to trade away beans your opponents need, if only to keep your own hand optimized.  

Now we realize the importance of being in markets where other players aren't competing.  We also track the number of each particular type of bean available after it has been harvested; no one wants a Garden Bean or a Red Bean if the others have already been sold.  Lastly, keeping track of [i]when[/i] cards are placed in the discard pile is an important consideration, especially before the last trip through the deck.  All of these considerations merge beautifully, and the 4P game is very enjoyable.

We had the chance to play the 5P game while my niece was staying with us.  It's even [i]better[/i].  Both of these realizations finally bump [i]Bohnanza[/i] up a point.

Great card game with nice mechanics. It feels like it is not important who's winning in the end, the gameplay is the fun part, the trading and the trashtalking. My GF really likes the game, and she is often winning even though she seems to do quite poor trades all the time... strange.

RATING: 4
I originally thought there was lattitude for strategy here, but after quite a few games I have developed a SoC indifference to this game. In my last game, one player could not put a foot wrong, every card drawn was plantable, and he seemed to always have options to trade with the rest of the table. Meanwhile my cards and sets were of little use to anyone especially me.

Fans say you can play around a bad hand, maybe you can, but for my 2d your options are at the mercy of the draw and best available plays seem obvious and mechanical.

Fun game, played a few times, but just thought it was ok...maybe I am not a big fan of trading games.

In an effort to accumulate more broad based games I can play with "non-gamers" I may have to pick this one up again as I traded off my copy months ago.

Great fun for all.  This game is a negiotation game.  Which means everyone at the table may be involved at every turn.  It's the interaction among players that make this a hoot and a half.  The types of different beans also add to it's hiliarity.

REALLY fun card-based trading game. You can be really crafty in how you wheel and deal, and the game has some interesting decisions (when to harvest your crops, what to replace, will you buy a third bean field??). The theme of bean farming is not exactly enticing, and the art is cartoony and silly, but you get your money's worth and then some.

In general I usually shy away from trading games but Bohnanza puts everyone in a very motivated position for negotiation every turn, making it easy and a blast to play.  Simple mechanics which are designed perfectly, this is what crappy games like Monopoly only wish they could have been.

Okay so I actually HAD to rate this game highly because my entire family absolutely LOVES it (they aren't hardcore board-gamers but do enjoy the occasional game of Catan or Dixit).  Anyway, it's by Uwe Rosenberg (the dude who made Agricola) and is a pretty lightweight card game.  The rules are easy to teach and there is constant player interaction with the ability to help/hurt other players.  I recommend this game because it is extremely versatile in that it works well with various player counts (it has specific changes based on number of characters that keep the game balanced) and it can be enjoyed by hardcore and casual gamers alike.

Great game when you've got a bunch of people together.  Not too hard to figure out, the one unique feature in the game is that you can't change the order of the cards in your hand except through trading out the cards you don't want. GO BOHNANZAs!

I was not at all interested in this game, but luckily my friends bought this and made me play it. It is a total negotiation game which works very well with 4-7 players. On the surface your could think it is based on luck, but actually you make your own luck in this game.

Owned by friends.

I've finally played this game after owning it for about a year.  However I have only played the 2-player Bean duel version of it with my 8 year old daughter a couple of times.  So far she has won both games.  She really enjoys it, and that makes it fun for me.  I really want to play the full version, however when my game group gets together this game just never hits the table.

My copy of the Spanish 2-deck box edition was stolen on September 2013. That edition was OOP, so I got the new edition, in a much bigger box including the Erweiterungs-Set. Taking the game with me easily was part of the appeal, so I gave the game to a friend that loves it.

For me, the more the merrier. Love this game. Great trading involved.

This game absolutely rocks with 5-7. There seems to be several people to trade with each round. You can even get people to give you beans for nothing. Seems pricey and unwise to dig 3rd bean field in 6-7 player game because there is always someone to trade with. To be good at this game you must try to deal with every person on every turn and corner a unique market. Be careful when trying to compete in bean market because there will be less to go around and more competition for trading.

The next time I play, I'm going to just repeatedly call out, like a stadium vendor or a carny, the kinds of beans I have to offer other players. If they need them they'll let me know. That should get me some deals.

A very entertaining card game.  The rule keeping you from sorting your hand is so contrary to the rules in any other card game that it can be a challenge to remember, but it really makes the game work.  We usually play this game as a kind game where there is a lot of donations and fair trades, but it can be ratcheted up so that you are a bit more cut-throat

This was one of our first games and it has had a place in our collection for years.  We always pull this game out when we want some comfort gaming with our family.  And really that's the perfect audience for this game, you want to play with families and non-gamers.  The strategy isn't high, but the fun is.

One of the first games I ever played, this bean planting card game is an evergreen that sees at least a play or two a year. Weelin' and dealin' is a must to get and plant the beans you need to and while sometimes someone lucks out and gets a lot of the rarer beans, being able to cash in on the common ones usually leads to success. 

This game is still one of my go-to's as a gateway game to people who come from card playing backgrounds.

I want to like this game more than I do.  Nothing wrong with it, except that it just isn't my cup of tea.  I've introduced it to people who have rushed online to buy a copy, but I've also introduced it to gamers who gag at the idea of being asked to play this again.  The "helpful 3-way trades" and such go against the grain of the more die-hard "screw-your-neighbour" style gamers.

There was a time when Bohnanza was a fun game: then better games were discovered, all of them more exciting than Bohnanza, which thence fell quickly into a well deserved oblivion.

Its major issue is, it’s a filler by theme, look and gameplay but it takes way too much time to be a real filler: add to this its main rule - the one preventing players from reorganize the cards they have in their hands - and you will have enough of Bohnanza soon. [i](February 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - The mere thought of playing Bohnanza again makes me sick, hence during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from 5 to 4.

Set collection game with restrictions on hand management and tableux that make the game what it is. A good set collection game, even if the garish theme and restrictive mechanics ultimately relegate it to the 'whatever' pile for me.

Surprisingly fun, lively and quick.  I found this to be a good trading/hand management game.  Stuff to think about, planning ahead, trading, whats not to like?  I played with five, very quick players.  I can't rate it higher as I think if this bogs down or if people aren't the trading type, it would become slow and painful.

Oddly fulfilling.

Update: Amazingly, my complaint with this game is its appeal to non-gamers.  This quality allows it to receive play far out of proportion to its quality.  Thus I have garnered a rather vociferous distaste for the game.  I have burned out.  Which may say something about the quality of the game or the quantity of my gaming library at the time.

When everyone I played with first saw the game box and the cards they were worried, but 10 games later (over 2 nights), everyone is convinced that this is a great game.  One of the few card games that I can get my gaming group to play and one of the few games I can get my family to play.

RATING: 8
This has become the most successful 'gateway' game in my collection.  Every time I've introduced it to 'non-gaming' family or friends, it's been a huge hit.  Easy to learn, a silly theme that really is just an amusing window dressing, and the player interactions and negotiations are what make it great.  It may not be a 'great' game, but it's a very fun game.

// This is a fun game for family night. It's light and

My only real complaint is that it can be difficult to 
audit and make sure people are managing their cards 
correctly--which I don't want to have to do, but cheating
in this game would be so easy and would absolutely break
the game.

A fun game to play with gamers who baulk at more challenging/time consuming games. Appeals to people who like to negotiate. I find that female players particularly enjoy this one. Guys look for more opportunities to do nasty things to other players...so maybe some special cards like 'frost' or 'blight' would help spice things up in this regard.

Overall, a simple card-collecting game ideal for a group of people.  It can be quite daunting when teaching the game to new players as the rules is truly unique.  But a few plays is usually all it takes for them to get the hang of the flow of the game.  After that, they are addicted! :)  This game is recommended for those people new to the tabletop gaming hobby.

This game will always be a classic in my mind.  If you approach it as an excercise in min/maxing your points, you'll probably be frustrated.  If you approach it as a negotiation game with some reasonable formatting to control the chaos of trading, it's a blast.  Distills the negotiation aspect of much longer complicated games into a simple core mechanic and plays fast.  Lots of little decisions to make, lots of moments of both relief and regret, and lots of room for creative solutions.  Fun, and that's what gaming is all about for me.

Bohnanza is a fun game. We (my wife and I) bought this game after we tried it first, not realizing that most of our gamingbuddies already own a copy of the game. We don't play it as much as we'd like, since most of our friends have played it so much, they don't find it much fun anymore :(

Flexible (2-7 players), easy to teach and learn. Another good "starter" game with considerable player interaction, thanks to trading.

A trading game with the fun theme of planting beans.  I like this one for large groups, as it keeps folks involved around the table.  I have had success with plenty of non-gamers, good gateway potential. Updages rating 4/2014 to a 7 from a 8, on more recent replays play time drags for what the game is.

Clever card game (of which I have not played too many) which is more of a full on game than the filler type (that is a label that a lot of card games get stuck with).

I do enjoy the game, but I dislike the set hand order rule.  I realize that this rule really makes this game, but it is awkward and difficult to teach new players.

This is definitely a game in which it is more fun with the _RIGHT_ group of people to play.

My initial rating has gone down a bit.  It's not so much a trading game as it is mutual dumping -- even if your opponent doesn't have anything to give you in return, it still usually seems to be best to dump the cards you don't want on him if he's willing to accept them.

The design (pictures on the cards) are a big plus; bright colors with with a fun look!
I originally gave it an 8.5 only because I prefer heavier games, but changed it to a 9 because of the unique concept and interaction involved.

Have now played this with the kids and solo.  It is an ok game that seems to be pretty light.  If I get the chance I'll try it on a party night (since it plays up to 7) but it's not high on my list.

Mar-2015: Taught this to the kids a year ago and they fell in love with it.  It's so neat to watch them "play nice" and help each other out with no thought about self-interest.  Hard to believe they're the same kids that play other games like Little Prince. 

I've probably still burned out on it with them but play it cause they love it.  Also, I'd like to give this a try with adults and see it at a more cutthroat level.

A great little card game witha twist. Never before had we found a car game in which you must play the cards in the order which you're dealt them. Only by trading away cards in your hand can you alter the sequence of cards you must play, and only by trading cards inot your firlds can you harvest rich rewards, so it's a strong trading game for sure!

Played a couple of times with a bunch of people.  I initially had a hard time with the "no rearranging your hand" aspect, as this is something I have learned to do when playing cardgames over many years.  I don't understand the game at this point, but I would be willing to try it again -- just with 5 or fewer people next time, so there's less downtime.

Having read the many glowing reviews, I tried to teach this to my wife and her sister and brother in law.  We faired... poorly.  The game was repetitive and rote, with few decisions, and none of the promised laughter over the stink bean.  In the forums, I was told that the game doesn't shine unless you play mean.  But with those I'm likely to play with, better to play a different (nicer) game and avoid sleeping on the couch.  

Update: Traded away.  My wife hated this with a passion, and I realized there was no way she would ever give it a second chance.

There was a stint when we played Bohnanza all the time. It's light enough for non-gamers to 'get', provided you can keep them from sorting their hand like they would for bridge or poker.

(11 plays) This is a great game! I love its interactive trading phase, it has just the right length for what it offers and it rewards clever trading, albeit being somewhat luck dependent. I have been playing several games now with my usual group and we all like it a lot.

I have been playing two six player games, too, using the 'Bohnanza Expansion Set' and found that the game drags on then, but it is still fun.

All that said, it's a game which should be played light heartedly. Players who are prone to make the one optimal trade may severely bog down the game and take a lot of fun out of it.

It could have something to do with the fact that we only had enough warm bodies to play this one two player, but it fell flat. I see the machinations at play, and it did make for a few interesting games, but in the end, it wasn't enough to justify the shelf space.

RATING: 6
One play. Has potential, but dragged a bit our first play. Felt as if I was missing something, as donating bad cards seemed to be the easy thing to do to line up cards in my hand, but I was giving opponents too much in return. We'll need to play again to see if we take the same approaches in  trading and giving away cards.

Bohnanza shines for a few reasons...

1) It is light enough that it doesn't feel like work.

2) It has interesting decisions and tension

3) The presence of trading and the tension of fixed hand order means that you are engaged in the game on everyone else's turn (which is something most light traditional card games lack)

In Bohnanza, you can chat with people around the table and just have an overall relaxing yet engaging experience with your friends and family. This absolutely kills games like Uno and Phase 10. Once someone knows the rules, it doesn't feel that much harder. Yet it provides decisions, engagement, and it's not just blind luck!

The one downside of Bohnanza is it can be a little difficult to teach with non-gamers (the audience that this game shines with). If people give it a chance, they'll get it after once or twice around the table, but it's been a tough sell to even get people to try it in my experience

RATING: 3
Decent card game.  Plays ok with 2 players.  The Bean theme didn't really appeal to to me or my wife. Will give it another play to see if our opinion improves. There's nothing wrong with this game, and we like many of this designer's games, but we'd rather play other games.

On Second play, opinion holds.  Artwork turns us off.  Rather play other card games.

RATING: 5
I played this ages ago and didn't like it very much at all.  I couldn't see the incentive to trade - and found the fixed hand mechanism more annoying and frustrating than refreshing and original. Played it again more recently and, by getting a rule *wrong*, actually ended up enjoying it a lot more than I had before...

2-7 | (5) | 45 min | 8+ | Uwe Rosenberg
One of the first games designed by U. Rosenberg, who would later go on to create such hits as Agricola and Le Havre. I played it once and found it wildly chaotic due to one house rule we used - each turn everybody could trade via the active player. I have no interest in playing it again since a) trading is one of my least favorite mechanics, and b) it felt like a light party game.

Removing bean cards per the number of players really helps keep the game from dragging, and makes for some more tension with the collection since others are more likely to be collecting the same type as you.  This has revised upward my opinion of the game.

RATING: 10
A wonderful filler for almost any number of players (with the expansion.)

This game always has a very relaxed feeling to it, since it is often helpful to help someone else by trading or even gifting beans. So even while playing to win, it feels less competitive than other games.

An especially interesting aspect of the trading in this game is that if you play too tight and only make deals that are only beneficial to you or at least mutually beneficial, people might stop trading with you altogether out of spite. I really enjoy this kind of group-think, because it encourages everyone to play (moderately) nicely in order to win. The same can happen in other games with trading (e.g. Settlers of Catan), but in Bonanza, where trading is the core pf the game, it plays a more significant role.

By far the best game about bean-trading that I have ever had the pleasure of playing.  Beans are pretty cool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game manages to be simultaneously fun and yet cleverly strategic in how you manage your beans. There's a good degree of social engineering in this game (in that, it reminds me of trading in Settlers or allying in Cosmic Encounter) in getting people to take beans from you when it may not be to their advantage. A certain sort of economics is involved, too: yes, a chili bean is worth more than a wax bean, but which means more to you and your bean fields? The most effective strategy I've found is to hold off buying a third field for as long as possible. Also, a Zen-like acceptance of your luck in drawing cards helps, too.

Still a good time, especially if you loosen up the trading rules.  Three-way trades?  Coo'.  Future promises?  Why not.  Three-way trades for other people's future promises?  You just blew my mind!  Update:  I've significantly upgraded this after many, many plays.  Not terribly deep, but it produces some of the best group interaction of any game, even with new players.  There's much to be said for that.

This game is a fun bartering game. It's easy to grasp and a good game for non-board game people. The game seems to go fairly quickly and keeps people interested. It's also usually a close finish which keeps everyone happy. The only downside is that it can get emo when people feel like they are getting taken advantage of or when a newbie is trading too freely to the best talker(and the best talker is not you ;) ) Overall a great game. The fan edition is especially enjoyable as you get to look at the funky art while you are waiting for your turn.

PS- I don't care what the game says, their called cowboys NOT blue beans.

Very light, very accessible card game. Far too long for what it is, but entertaining nonetheless. The strict hand-order mechanic is unusual and takes some getting used to, but is pretty fun once you embrace it. Because you can't change the order of cards in your hand, however, it's basically a pure negotiation game, which can be both random and frustrating, instead of a more traditional hand management game where you have more control. Not my favorite, but certainly different from other card games we own, and it's great for non-gamers, so that's a plus.

For me, Bohnanza is the ultimate pure negotiation/trading game.  It plays quickly and you spend the whole time bargaining and begging, yelling and pleading.  It's wonderful.

This would be no find played quietly, as a eurogame, so you need a group of people who are willing to be vocal.  And you certainly have to be in the mood for politics.  When those conditions are met, Bohnanza is never far from my mind.

Really needs at least 3 players to make trading work well, and is even better with more players. It's a riot for big family gatherings on the farm. I have not tried the 2 player variant, but suspect it wouldn't work as well. I'm a fairly generous trader, and I like playing with like-minded people. It's less fun when one person drags things down.

Great fun, and very different from any other card game I've played.  Even my 5 and 8 year old enjoy it (we made a card holder for my 5 year old by cutting a slot in a foot-long 2x2 board).  It takes a couple of plays to get the rules down, but it is quite intuitive after that.  Love the pics on the cards too!

UPDATE:  Still going strong with this game after two years of fairly frequent family play.  Along with Frank's Zoo, this is our most beloved family game. It's got real staying power!

RATING: 8
Played once with three players. I did not have high expectations for this game, but wow, what a blast. The free-form trading is the key. By the end of the game (we only exhausted the deck once, due to the late hour), we had each drawn elaborate "contracts" with the opposing players: "If I take your two coffee beans, you promise to give me three cards that I want, over a maximum of two turns." Surprisingly, honest promises were more fun than broken promises, which introduced considerable rancor when they occurred and so were banned (by consensus).

UPDATE: Downgrading from 9 to 8 because our second play took way too long (2.5 hours for 5 players) and got a little bit repetitive. Must figure out how to speed things up.

UPDATE: Played with 3 people who know the game well, the game just blazes along. We actually played it twice in about an hour and a half -- and with the proper ending conditions too (exhausting the deck thrice)! Wonderful game.

A pure trading/hand management game, made interesting in that you can never reorganize your hand.  So you'll need to do a lot of hardcore trading in order to get out of playing cards that you really don't want to play.  In fact, half the time you'll be willing to make some terrible trades just to get out of a card.

Great game to introduce people to the hobby!  All in all, I'd usually be willing to play this one.

RATING: 7
4/10/10: After one play, it's clear that Bohnanza is really not my sort of game.  The game is 90% negotiation and 10% hand-management.  While it is slightly less appalling than Killer Bunnies, it exists in roughly the same space.  

If all players were equally skilled in evaluating the relative value of the bean cards, the winner would be determined by a combination of luck-of-the-draw and kingmaking/bash-the-leader.  To make it resemble a strategy game, then, Bohnanza seems to require an exploitation of the new or weak players, often through cajoling or other meta-gaming.  This, I take no enjoyment from.  


2/6/11: With additional plays (largely because my game group loves it), I've actually come around a bit on Bohnanza.  It's not a game that I would recommend to others, and I'm not particularly eager to play it, but it's a more interesting game than most of the card-based filler that all-too-often hits the table with my group (Guillotine, for example).

Wow, this took a long time for us to buy, and about the same amount of time to get it to the table.  Now that the wifie has played it and loves it I know we will be playing it a lot more often.  Bought additional copies to give as gifts this Christmas.  People love the Bean laying game.  (12/14/08)

We get Heather's parents to play this game with us, and everyone in the family no has a copy of it.  Much requested and much loved.  (01/04/10)


Still much requested and 41 games into it I have to downgrade from 8.5 to 7 due to all the randomness and the weird trading that I always lose out on (sour grapes I admit).  until I find a better strategy that actually works.  (10/6/10)

Yeah, I am done with this game.  Downgraded to 5 from 7 after one too many games where it just wasn't any fun at all.  Too long for what it is.  Sour grapes again but boo hiss!  (6/2/11)

This one took me a while to warm up to but I now enjoy it quite a bit. It appears at first to be a rather bland, traditional playing card game but it is in fact an excellent negotiation game with a lot of depth and meaningful player interaction. However, even though it plays anywhere from 2-7 players, the more players you have the better and it really requires 3 at least to be worthwhile. It's also a great family game to play over the holidays.

My kids (pre-teens and young teens) value this game highly--but they play it slowly, which means it really bogs down in the trades. So I'm "Bohnanza'd out," though I'd like to play it with an experienced adult group some time that PLAYS IT FASTER! Some nifty trading rules make the trading and planting fun and tense--this is one of those games where, at least in the early phases, you can never quite do what you want to do. That's a good thing.

This is my go-to recommendation for a good trading and negotiation game.

The best part of the game is the market fluctuations - sometimes someone will want to get rid of beans more than anyone else will want to take them. It makes the trading an interesting dynamic.

A couple rules to keep in mind:

- You can't change the order of the cards in your hand.
- You can't dig up a one-bean field, if you have fields with more than one bean.

RATING: 10
There's a quantity versus quality tension here that I really appreciate. A player who focuses on getting the best deals will likely do worse than one who focuses on getting lots of deals, even if they come slightly behind on some of them. There is a point where this no longer holds, of course, but it is a fascinating point of tension.

The hand management of this game is one of the most brilliant mechanisms I've ever seen. It's what encourages people to not only want to get in deals, but also to give.

For best results, people should not be spending five minutes haggling over deals or trying to get people to make them. If you can't make a deal right away, just accept it and move on. If this game drags, it really drags.

RATING: 5
This becomes less fun with each game I play.  I might be playing wrong but half of the cards that get flipped nobody wants.  Maybe if you have 5 or 6 people it would be okay.  But with 3 or 4 there just isn't enough competition for the cards to encourage enough trading.  I'm still giving it a five in the hopes that the game will improve if we add more players.

A classic. Not being able to rearrange your hand really makes for some great tension. It's light enough that even nongamers can play and enjoy it, but it's even better when played with a really cutthroat group!

Update: This is one of the first games I bought when getting into the hobby, and honestly it's probably still my favorite trading game. Not being able to rearrange your hand makes for some real desperation, which leads to a level of ferocity with trades that isn't present in many other games in the genre. Like all negotiation games, it's really group-dependent but when it shines, it really shines bright.

Game is okay...the rules seemed to be a little complex for a game about bean farming.  For some reason it took us longer to grasp the concept than we would have thought.  After re-reading the rules, it seems we didn't even play it right.  My husband thought it was due to a bad translation of the rules to English...some sentences are a little unclear.  I'm willing to try this again.

Bohnanza was my gateway game that exposed me to other Euro and strategy boardgames.

What a funny little game this is! I never imagined it could actually be so much fun - I'm not sure WHY it is, but it is. I guess it's because of the elements of luck, tactics, good/funny artwork on the cards, auction and tough negotiation all combined in a good little card game which plays 2-7 players. I do prefer it with 4-5 - 3 and 6 are also okay, but 2 is not funny and 7 drags on and on. Actually, even with 4-5 players it might go on a little long depending on your game group, but that could basically be said about every game. I think it's a great and very unique game and many non-gamers seem to like it as they often request that we play it.

Additionally, there are multiple expansions for this game which can spice up the game if it turns out to be repetitive, but I like vanilla Bohnanza very much on its own!

My recommended number of players: 4, 5

When I first read the rules I thought "Dude, where's the game?" Really, it doesn't sound like much at all when you read the rules. But then you play! Trading, trading, trading---"I'll take your wax if you take my stink." Can't change the order of your hand = brilliant design. 

Update January 09: Just taught and witnessed one of the most amazingly active and wild games of Bohnanza I've ever seen---WHAT A JOY! Maybe it isn't the tightest strategic exercise but people can throw themselves into the trading. Raised score just because of watching a game be so fun for new players. My students were cracking up and yelling and totally immersed in bean farming. BEAUTIFUL THING TO WITNESS!

Beans. Frigg'n awesome beans!

I like it best with five players using the original deck, not the expansion.  The art really needs an update for the American market - the puns just don't work in English, and the Germans seem to call some things beans that we don't.  (Since when is a chili pepper a bean?)

Played this with 2 and 3 players and thought it was fine. I don't think this game should be played with 2 or 3. 2 players are boring, and with 3 the trading is minimal and can be unfair. I do think it would be better with 4-6 players because the trading among players will be better.  The game and theme are family friendly for game times, but I wouldn't want to play it otherwise.

My criterion for rating games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: Fun to see what order your beans are going to be in. You feel like you are stuck with what you have and this can make each game play out a bit differently.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. I feel like the decisions I make in this game don't really matter. Plant the beans with the most coins or beans? Not much of a choice most of the time

3) Player interaction:  A ton of interaction as you try to get people to trade you beans so you don't get stuck planting beans you don't want.

4) Components/artwork: The game looks awesome and I love how the beans are also the coins. The artwork and names of the beans are very amusing and fun.

5) Game length/complexity:  The game goes a bit too long for what it is. It is fun and not too hard, but can drag out a bit. Plus the sorting of cards at the beginning depending on the number of players is very tedious.

Ah Bohnanza, I am of two minds with thee. 

The amount of fun I have in this game is directly related to who I am playing with. For people that refuse to trade, or like to trade with someone else (for instance their wife ;)), this game can be a lesson in madness. 

As a light game, this is usually fairly fun, and kind of a nice appetizer to the main course (Agricola or Le Havre).

Entertaining and easy to pick up. Fun cards, the artwork on which (Rio Grande version) reminds me of Too Many Cooks. There are many agonizing moments when I have to harvest a field and don't want to. Seems a bit lengthy as a filler (going through the deck a full three times) and I think is too light to be the main entree of game night... but this would make a great family game.

We immediately started playing with replica dubloons instead of using the card backs as coin markers -- this added a lot to the feel of the game, although dried beans are probably more appropriate.

[i]Update November 2006[/i] - Have the German Amigo edition with Erweiterungs. Even though we don't know German, we love this far more than the English.. 1/2/07 - upped score to 9.

It's a game about beans!  Stink beans, chili beans, gree beans, and STINK BEANS!  Ahh.. the stink bean.  I love you stink bean.

Bohnanza is one of the better negotiation games I own, and a potential gateway game for non-gamers. Every negotiation game needs a mechanic that "drives" the negotiation. In Bohnanza, the mechanic is that a player draws cards on their turn, and they need to get "planted" somewhere. Every card that hits the table never goes back into a player's hand, so it is negotiation that determines where those "beans" end up.

For negotiation, I ultimately prefer Chinatown. The occasional turn in Bohnanza can sometimes be pretty flat if the wrong beans crop up or if a player's choices are no-brainers. But Bohnanza is valuable because it is flexible. It's portable, it can handle a wide range of player counts, and it's pretty easy to teach. About the only thing odd about Bohnanza for newbies is the rule that prevents ordering cards in your hand, and the oddness of drawing cards at the end of a turn. Ultimately, Bohnanza is one of those games that I never clamor for, but it always ends up getting played every once in a while.

Finally had a chance to play this classic card game and I enjoyed it but it just took too long to play. Three times through the deck was too much even with each round taking 5 cards off of it. The game also has a lot of negotiating between players since each turn 2 cards need to be traded between the players. The gimmick here is when you plant beans you can only play from the front of your hand, but when you trade you can trade from anywhere in your hand so it's advantageous to trade and negotiate as much as you can. I liked the idea of this, but it just started feeling repetitive towards the latter half and I was beginning to wish it was over a little faster.

Although this game comes out relatively often when we're looking for games that fit 5+ people, I've never played it with any expansions.  I like playing this game with people who'll take turns *relatively* quickly.  Five minutes of discussion to trade off two measly beans is a little too much for me.

We first played this with 2 players and didn't see what all the fuss was about.  (It was also annoying to read through the rules and then find that most of the rules were different for 2.)  However, we then played with 5 and everybody loved it!  Even the people who don't usually like games wanted to play again and again.  Keeping our cards in the order drawn was the biggest adjustment for everyone, but we quickly caught on.  Since then, we've played with 3 and 7, and it seems to help to be up on the higher end of the range.  The attitudes of the players makes a big difference too; the game is a blast if people are willing to give it a chance.

Uwe Rosenburg believe it or not.  We love Agricola, so this seemed like a good purchase.  It has been.  Nongamers seem to like this one.  I don't care for negotiation in game, so a game that revolves around that mechanic is not my cup of tea.

Trading, shouting, pleading. Getting forced into a corner by a bad card draw. It's perhaps a little long but it's a very good game.

RATING: 8
Interesting card game which heavily features trading.  Only game I know of in which you cannot shuffle the order of your hand of cards as the order dictates what beans you have to deal with.

Basic idea is that you plant beans in a field.  You only have two fields at a time and fields can only hold one type of bean.  The more beans you plant in the field, the more valuable the field becomes when you harvest.  However, you have to deal with some random beans on your turn.  If you are unable to plant them in a current field or pawn them off to an opponent, then you will be forced to harvest a field before you want to.

A lot of trades end up being something like:
Player 1: "You trade me your wax bean, and, in return, I'll take your wax bean off your hands for you"
Player 2: "Deal"

A great family game with enough fun for everyone.  Players are bean farmers and work to plant and reap fields for coins.  There is a good measure of negotiation and a tad bit of strategy.  Works with gamers and non-games alike.  I wish I had stock in the game, as I have had so many newcomers go right out and buy it.

This game can be SO much fun with 3 to 7 players. The trading part is where all the fun is, so I do not consider this to be a 2 player game at all. There is so much player interaction during the trading and so much laughter. My enjoyment of this game is a 9 or a 10 when I play with MOST people. 

This game's only real flaw is that it can become so popular you end up playing it too much, which makes you a bit tired of it for a while. But it is a great game.

Bohnanza is a friendly trading game. It is simple, social and fun. It has some silly artwork, and you should expect to laugh at least a little bit during this game. My gamer friends enjoy it, my non-gamer friends enjoy it, and my wife enjoys it. That's always a good sign for a game. It's also cheap and portable, so I recommend this for any gamer who is willing to play light card games.

RATING: 8
One of my gateways into the hobby.  Fast fun game with the right crowd, and a neat mechanic about card order.

This should be the introduction to negotiating games for most new players.  It's almost fun just to watch the consternation build as deals are made.  Like all games of this ilk, it can suffer from kingmaking with a crowd that is ready for it to end.  My family, however, all want to win too much to let this happen.

RATING: 4
A gateway, light trading game that features hand management and set collection as its primary mechanics.

I imagine the appeal of this is mainly that it can be played with non-gamers, and as that weight of game goes, this isn't something I dislike intensely. That said, there are also other games that do similar things that I like a lot more (i.e.: Siedler).

I think the best thing in this game is the card art, which is whimsical and cute. If you like the basic game mechanics, but want something depthier, Oltremare is highly suggested, particularly the first edition with the tiny board.

RATING: 5
OK game but a little light for my taste.

NB
I'm becomming aware that abstract games are not my taste and this refects in my opinion of many games).  The theme on many simple games are painted on to level I find difficult.

Games in this grouping:
Taluva
Lost Cities
Bohanza
Jet Set
Junta
Enemy in Sight
Naval War

Some more complex game have a level of abstration that does not meet my expectation for the theme/subject etc.  This makes the game a less compelling experience.

Games in this grouping:
Elder Signs
Reef Encounter
Modern Naval Battles
The Fury of Dracula

My enthusiasm for these games is limited by a level of abstraction that challenges my taste and my rating reflects this.

I can't say that I am a fan.

Enero 08. Generación X, pagado con su abono de 10% por compra (10,50)

Cada jugador planta judias en 2 o 3 campos para venderlas. Cuantas mas judias de una misma variedad se tengan plantadas, mas oro se ganara en la venta. El objetivo es ganar la mayor cantidad de oro plantando, cosechando y vendiendo judias.
Lo que hace diferente a este popular juego de cartas es que no puedes reordenar tu mano. Tienes que jugar tus cartas en el orden en que te llegan. Para poder deshacerte de cartas que no quieras plantar o conseguir judias que te interesen es fundamental la negociacion con los demas jugadores.

Initial play - very good game.  Expect it to maintain high level of interest.

This game is surprisingly fun on repeated plays.

Not bad - but I always get confused playing it for some reason - lack of brains probably! It can be ruined by players refusing to trade with others or offering silly deals to one player repeatedly (which happened in my last game where one bloke basically ruined the game). It's still a good family 'filler' for 4-5 players who trade evenly that I'm happy to play.

Great family game. The children love the trading and negotiating - they're firm but fair! Tough decisions to be made when planting and harvesting, owing to the mechanism of not re-arranging the bean cards in your hand. We've played with 4 players and 7 players, and it works with both. This was our go-to game when we went camping and it rained constantly...

My early opinion was that the game was merely a complicated way to sort the cards.  It's improved a little since then to where I can say I have had fun with it.  It largely depends on the players - if players slow it down it's almost unbearable.  Also, it's proven very popular with non-gamers, so I'll give it credit for that.  Interestingly, I find that the 2 player game has a different feel and actually enjoy that more.

RATING: 7
Very simple hand-rigging game with a cute theme. fairly straightforward to teach to new players. Each turn you need to plant the first bean card in your hand and may plant an additional one - you rig your hand by trading with other players before your turn rolls around. The player with the most coins (earned by harvesting sets of planted beans) after the deck has been cycled through 3 times is the winner.

Makes for a nice party game - because of the trading there is always something to do even if it isn't your turn. 

After playing this a fair few times I am starting to find the lack of mechanics uninteresting compared to other games.

This is the first ever "new" board game we played one night at UQ with some other students we met.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent game. Simple premise but meaningful decisions. 

It does have a few weaknesses:

1. It really isn't a short game although it feels like it should be. In a competitive game this isn't a problem but if things aren't cutthroat then the ending is a long time coming. 

2. Poor trades can really screw up the competitiveness. I often find myself intervening and pleading people to be more stingy. The trading can feel trivial to players but it is the most important part of the game. It's more an issue with players than the game, but is nearly always an issue.

Actually way more fun and interesting than I thought it might be (kinda bought it on a whim, cheap and recommended)

One of the only things I didn't like out of my first game was the length (or how long they wanted us to play) I may have shuffled too many cards in, and I'm sure the game will play different with more than three people, but two reshuffles was gonna make for like an hour and a half game it seemed, so we only did one.

Still, really cool game, unlike any other card game I've ever played.

Biggest waste of time I have ever played. You don't so much as play this game as watch this game go by. There is nothing to do in this game. You simply watch cards go by.

Total crapola.

I enjoyed it my few playings, but for whatever reason, I don't find it them gem that it is commonly regarded as. It is often lauded for its negotiation, but I find most of the negotiation forced (players are often desparate to get RID of a card, and usually someone wants it--if they can give something else useful in return, then that's a bonus). Perhaps if hands were played face-up then I would agree about the negotiation. I don't care for the machanic where everyone is required to add cards to one side of their hand, remove from the other, and never rearrange.

Not sure what to make of this after an initial go. Only when seeing it actually played did I begin to understand what was going on, but the ceaseless trading, cajoling and begging began to grate on my nerves sooner than I expected it would. If every trading round was forced to be concluded in 30 seconds or so it might be a somewhat fun game, but in its current inception it just failed interest me much. The idea of not being able to rearrange your hand is novel, I'll give the designer that, but at the same time I wonder how many people secretly cheat and move desirable cards to the front of their deck. Doing so will break the game quite easily.

We like this game very much, but we don't care for the two-player rules (the "bean duel") at all.  The fun does depend somewhat on who is playing (but what game is fun when one or more players complain throughout?).  We especially enjoy the player interaction required to negotiate trades.  Most of the people we have convinced to try the game loved it, but a few protested that they were confused the whole time.  The cards are clever and funny and listening to the game is a great enticement for other potential players nearby. Our rating is only 2 for the two-player version.

Lekka i przyjemna gra karciana z niewielką dozą planowania. Proste zasady - łatwo wprowadzić nową osobę w grę. Zabawne rysunki - świetna na różne towarzyskie i rodzinne spotkania w różnych grupach wiekowych. Mały format - można ją bez problemu zabrać wszędzie. Z pewnością przypadnie do gustu dzieciom ze względu na zabawne nazwy fasolek (co ciekawe każda z nich odpowiada innemu gatunkowi fasoli) i rysunki, ale niech nie zwiedzie to dorosłych, bo gra naprawdę jest ciekawa i odprężająca.

Kids had about two weeks of solid play and fun with this one.  It was all they asked for.  Now it sits and I cannot get the kids to play it again.  I could take it or leave it.

It may be fun with more people, but the rules are kind of clunky and doesn't work well with non-gamers.

9/07 - Was able to play this one again, and it was much better.  I think I need to let this one sit longer between playings to enjoy it more.  Teaches Win-Win.

June 2009 - Kids are getting a lot of use out of this one again.  Its grown on me a bit too.

Fantastic group game.  Works well to break the ice or open a gaming session with a slightly larger than normal group (assuming your usual group is 3-4 people).  Too bad there's no way to make a 2 player game work, but that aside, it's a fun game with a lot of tension towards the endgame. *edit* My mistake...the newer edition has good 2-player rules that are actualy very interesting in that they change the game's core by instituting a very clever "public" hand of cards that's effect by different factors.  It's almost a different game with two.

Great way to introduce people to trading with a simple goods collect and sell.

Can get a little off track by the end when you're usually looking to maximize your own score, not necessarily deny others. I'm certainly not trying to remember three other scores, but there is often a sense of who is in the lead.

Absolutely a first rate card game.  It's a lot of fun.  Even people who don't really like to play games enjoy this one.  The best thing about the game is that it is wonderfully social.  The trading/donating aspect of every turn produces a lot of interaction between the players.  Also, it's a game that pretty much anyone can win - regardless of level of experience with the game.  While it is far from my favourite game, it's a must-have for anyone's game collection and that is a big part of why I have rated it a 10.  What it does, it does very well.

RATING: 7
We've played this game many times now. This is a really great game. The game allows for many players (2-7). It’s a card game that can be set up quickly. This game could become  a family favorite. 

	• It has infinite replayability
	• Excellent player involvement - trading keeps players involved for every player turn. 
	• Multiple ways to win - start a 3rd bean field? 
	• Good game for non-gamers

There were a couple of parts to the game that at first seemed a little arbitrary - card order and donating. But once you get a few rounds into the game you realize that the constraint of card-order forces to you think and strategize. Donating cards to others it critical for building the right hand before its your turn. 

One downside: I don't like the art. The pictures are campy and ridiculous which doesn't match the classic nature of the game.

I was introduced to this game in the early 2000's.  It was in the early stages of my movement to more complex strategy games.  I was going from Parker Brothers games to Catan and then to this.

Components: Wonderful artwork on high-quality cards.

Fan edition: Wide variety of entertaining cards, but it makes it more confusing, less unified, and the cards lack the numbers indicating how many cards there are of each type. The fan edition is practically unplayable.

Experience: The mechanics are quite simple, but choosing how best to manage my hand of cards, and maximize trades, is a true delight. There isn't enough continuity from turn to turn; I'd enjoy it more if I had a long-term strategy, rather than just working with what I've got from round to round. This game has lost its shine over the years.

This is a fine card game with an original card playing mechanic i.e. cards must be played in the order they are received.  The cards also serve the purpose of scoring i.e. the reverse side of the cards show "gold coins" that are collected during the game.  I would have rated this one higher but this really isn't a 2 player game as advertised (2-7 players) and is merely average with 3 players.  I think the game only really begins to shine with 4 players.  There are many more opportunities for competitive negotiation and clever trading with more players (5+).

RATING: 5.5
There's trading in this game and having only minimal options when trading makes the strategy harder than a normal trading game. It's a good card game but plays too long for a simple card game. I would play this game again but due to the long player turns and length of the game, there's other games that fit this time range that are much better.

RATING: 4
Too random, especially the negotiation. Also, too much downtime. Useful primarily as a gateway and for large groups. This is more a party game than a gamer's game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this case there are plenty of better options around. Disclaimer: negotiation games never seem to work with me or my group... people are either way too generous or the game gets bogged down in tedious negotiations.

RATING: 3
Hmm, didn't really click with me, the ability to do well depends on how much others are willing to trade with you, descisions are mostly obvious, i don't like open negotiation without any kind of binding agreement. I.e. civilization trading is open but resolved immediately, transactions are binding and there are clear rules for trade offers, in bohnanza trades are often made for help you out later promises.

Simple rules. Elegant. Works well with 2p. 50-50 luck/skill. I'm interested to see how well it works with more.

A great trading game for multiplayer play. Can get slowed down as folk want something more equitable or favourable and can't get it (because generally-small hand sizes don't give a massive amount to trade with).

Deliberation can slow the game down but generally a fun, social event with a lot of luck. COMPLETELY different game between 2 and 5/4p.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I'm not the biggest fan of this game, but non-gamers and casual gamers seem to enjoy it, thus making it decent in my book.  

I find that the casual crowd is all friendly and helpful when trading, whereas I want to be cut-throat and take advantage of people.  I guess it's safe to say that I usually get boycotted early on, and that may play a part in my lack of enjoyment.

Hmmpf...

This is a great family game, although the last round always seems to drag on a bit. The game forces you to negotiate (otherwise you can never win), sometimes you get a good deal, sometimes not. I've yet to play a game where someone always got what he/she wanted in every trade. And the game is very portable (just cards)!

Nice game wich I enjoy playing. Nice as a filler too. I don't like the childish look of it though, and the look of it has also been a problem when introducing the game to others. When they finally try it though, they seem to like it.
Fast funny game with 3, but better with 4 or more players

RATING: 7.8
Dull, dull after you've played Oltre Mare. Too deterministic, too many regulations. More plays, and I will play it, have some fun, but I still don't really care for it. Depending on what you draw, you can have little action regarding trading, so ther can be large periods of downtime, or at least for me. 
EDIT: game with 4 that was much, much better. I'm finally learning this one, but it is brutal to learn it usually.  Still not highly rated but bareable and kind of fun once you get the swing of the turn planning.

Wow this is not a staple of my mostly female group. Still not excited to play it but it has been a huge hit.

Summer 2012: I only have ~20 plays behind me when writing this, but this game is amazing. Okay, strategically it's pretty basic and easy to figure out, but for me the most important thing is that everyone is having fun.

And that has happened every time. I've introduced it to people who've never played anything and I've played it with our regular group. I've played it with over 20 different people and every single one has enjoyed it. 

The game feels different with different people. It brings out the personalities of people in a new way and it's interesting to see how their haggling skills evolve.

It's an amazing game and I'm not completly sure how to rate it yet. I think when I get bored to it, I'll really get bored.

Edit July '13, 8 -> 7: It has gotten a bit dull. Maybe I've gotten an overdose, but it lasted surprisingly long as a game I was willing to play.

2p is a whole different beast from 3-7p: it's less about trading and more about trying to benefit more from the discard pile while trying to block your opponent from doing so, using some strategy and pushing your luck a little bit.

After playing this game with someone who likes the game, I did enjoy it more than back in 2005. I'm still not really sure about this one but I had the feeling, that my old rating of 4 wasn't appropriate anymore.

[2005]
Well, after buying and playing this game I realized that I don´t like pure trading games. Somehow I can´t see what I have to do in order to win.

Nevertheless I guess the game itself can be quite good if it is played with the right people, whereas I have to say that it is quite boring with just three players.

So if you really like trading games with simple rules you should give this a try. If you don´t like them, you should play a round before you decide if you want to spent the money and get a copy.

Since I could be talked into playing a round occasionally I´ll rate it 4.

A very fun game and one of the most popular games I've ever purchased. Embraced by everyone I've ever played with. Some complain the play is pretty mechanical, but that would imply that there would be more luck involved. That seems unlikely, considering how rarely I actually win this game.

Just re-rated it after starting to play again and bumped it back up to a 9. This is a true classic and probably has given me more hours of gaming fun per dollar than any other game ever. We actually have worn out one set and had to replace it with a new one.

Fun, simple and allows up to 7 players.

Very social, maybe sometimes too social (with 7 players, some player are likely to start off-topic discussions if they are waiting theuir next turn and are not equipped to trade-in).

In some gaming night occasions, this is most likely one of the best game for high number of players.

Does not really play well <4.

If haggling is something you enjoy then Bohnanza is for you! I really like the 'required planting' mechanic and the situations it creates. Games of this nature can only be played so often as they devolve into arguments and 'you scratch my back' agreements that tend to last beyond the game. This is a light, filler game that may seem better through my nostalgia goggles than it actually is.

Why this isn't a 10:
-> Game success depends on others' willingness to trade you for what you (and they) need
-> Longer playtime for what it is
-> Waxy for a Stinky? Anyone?

Just flat out fun. I love this game and can't give it high enough praise.

I like to think about it as the game that has the highest player interaction but at the same time forces people to be nice to each other. Brilliant!

Also, I find the much maligned 2 player variant to be a nifty way to spend a couple of minutes. Not nearly as good as the regular game but still fun.

Great as a party game, or a holiday game.    Even people new to gaming entirely can pick it up and enjoy shouting deperate trades at each other.  But at the end, it is hard to really say what you did right or wrong.  The game ends, and the scores are a surprise.  Good mechanics though.

Cute little trading game about growing beans. Players must plant beans from their hand of bean cards, and nuture them into large beanfields. These beans can be harvested for &quot;coins&quot;, and different beans can be worth more or less coins depending on their rarity. Also, on every player&#039;s turn, two beans are turned up for trading with the other players. Most coins wins after three times through the deck.

Bohnanza is ok. I find it a bit too long for what it is. The most fun I have with it is when I'm haggling over bean trades (or interfering with others :devil:), but this just lenthens the game. I won't refuse to play it, but I certainly won't suggest it.

This is a fun trading game that definitely speeds up as you go through it and everyone gets the hang of it.  Fans of Pit will like this one, though it isn't quite as frantic and there aren't any bears to pass off to anybody.  If you don't like trading games or you aren't interested in being vocal about making trades, you may not like this game.  A lot more fun than its theme (bean planting?) might suggest. Plus you can play with a lot of players!!

RATING: 5.5
This was another early Eurogame purchase for me, back when the cards were still in german.  Affectionately known as "the bean game" amongst my family and friends, this gets requested and played often, and some of my friends have gone on to buy their own copy.  Easy to teach to non-gamers, and very very portable!

Overall though, I feel this game hasn't aged well, I rarely want to play it in comparison to other card games.  I would rather play Citadels or No Thanks.

Update: gave it to my sister as a gift.

RATING: 7.5
Crowd pleaser. Who knew that bean farming was a universally loved theme? I think the gameplay is a little lacking*, but it's a nice background for a relaxing social gathering (if everyone is generally cooperative). The game itself would probably be more interesting if played aggressively, but this game would not be a top choice for me when looking for a challenge.

*I think the problem is that players have such a large incentive to dump cards they don't need that it's always a buyer's market. This makes it harder to negotiate on the relative value of each card (e.g. the cocoa bean is much more valuable than the coffee bean, but it's hard to get anything better than a 1:1 trade because each play risks really screwing up their hand if they don't get rid of the card they don't need, so any trade is "usually" better than no trade IMO).

I just bumped the rating up on this one because I think the variant that allows trading future cards will fix the problem I was having that the trades were hard to make equitable. Unfortunately, I'm not surprised that I didn't naturally think of this myself.

+ This is a great gateway game and I enjoy it very much for the trading aspect alone. The people I introduce it to enjoy it as well, especially when they get a good deal. Since the game is fairly compact, this is one of my go to games when leaving the house.

- In this game, there is one awkward card rule. You cannot rearrange or shuffle your cards that you have been dealt. You must leave the cards in that order. And that can be hard for some people to coupe with, because when you are dealt a hand cards you automatically want to set them in a certain order.
Another item would be at the higher player counts, at 7 players you start out with 3 cards if you are the first player. The next player has 4, the player after has 5, and the rest has 6 cards. And if you completed all your trading after the first 3 people, you end up waiting around before it is your turn again.

Re-playing this after years has upgraded my opinion of it. I'm still not exactly a fan, but there is definitely a game here. The restrictions are a useful way to encourage trading, but chance of the draw and others' ebbing of stubbornness will overpower strategy and persuasion.

Played this recently, but realized later that we'd forgotten the can't sell beans with 1 bean rule.  Liked the bartering and helping others to help yourself.

Can be frustrating to play too, especially when people think that you, as The Gamer, is more likely to win, and are more likely to be more stingy with you.

RATING: 7
Fun hand management card game that encourages banter between players. Tough and rewarding to figure out how to plant the beans you want and get the useless ones out of your hand, while at the same time trying not to give the opponents what they need to win. 

It has the potential to become one of those games where one player doesn't care - then that player gives all of his or her good cards to a friend, and that's always annoying. So play with the right people. :)

This game has probably had more table time than any other game I own, its a great go to game and like Dominion, never gets old.

I love this little bean trading game, sometimes it can get a little cutthroat - but that just makes it better!

Plays fantastically well with literally any number of allowed players, and its slightly different depending on how many you play with.

Still can't believe the designer of this great classic is also the father or Agricola!

Bohnanza seems to be rather friendly for a trading game, as trades feel more cooperative than competitive.  I think it is essential to keep the game moving quickly, or it starts to feel long.  I also don't see the need for the expansions, which would seem to bog things down, with the possible exception of the order cards from High Bohn Plus.  Overall, I think it is a good game, but the people I play with like the game more than I do.

Good bargaining skills tested. You play a bean farmer planting beans for which you get gold when you harvest. You only have 2 fields and can only plant a type of bean in it at any time. The more you have before you harvest, the more gold you get. You do this by trading and bargaining for the beans you want from the other players. Plays well with not less than 4, I find it best with 5.

Plant beans in your fields and cash them in at the right time. Most gold wins. At first, I thought this was a simple game but later playings have shown that negotiation can play just a big of a role as the luck of the draw. Even with limited ways to win, still fun and good for a large group.

A fun game, but one that I'm more likely to break out with family than the game-group. Very torn on the 'static hand order' rule - fascinating idea in theory, but difficult to execute. Some people have trouble remembering this rule, or may tend to drop cards, essentially breaking the game.

Family weight comes through in that the pathway forward is generally pretty clear - decisions aren't tough, and trades are pretty easy to pull off.

RATING: 5
To maintain endgame tension, it appears that everyone needs to deny leaders what they want. If one person doesn't do that, they may make it too easy for a leader to stay ahead.

The game seemed long with 5. Perhaps using the original card distribution would help?

The game only occasionally created opportunities for two players to fight over a trade. It didn't appear to allow players to choose high-risk, high-reward strategies. Instead, points accumulated somewhat linearly.

Wicked, almost party game of hectic haggling and banter. Silly bean vendors are trying their best to grow large and rare beanstalks in order to get the most money, but beans are only grow if they manage to persuade other players to give them their beans, if possible for free. It lasts tiny bit longer than it should for a light game, but it's OK, nothing more.

This is a decent low confrontation trading game. China Town, Intrigue and Pit are probably all more visceral intense experiences and might be better games.

Didn't particularly enjoy the mechanic of Bohnanza. Trading can be frustrating. It is rather repetitive and too long for what it is. I would of thought that this kind of card game would play faster. I don't is why Bohnanza is so popular.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. 

I might play it again with non-gamers. If I have just regular gamers, I would play something else.

It might not have the sex appeal of 7 Wonders (yes, I'm looking at you Altar), but it's a lot more fun.  It's a raucous wheelin' and dealin' trade fest, and if you don't like that than you're just an old smelly stink bean, or maybe just someone who doesn't like trading games.  If you do like trading games and are also looking for a game that scratches the seven player itch then this is the one I'd recommend.  Everyone I've played with has loved it.

So fun to yell at each other as though your life will end if someone does not take that bean from you and plant it.

Possibly my favourite group game, although hard to keep players reminded of not rearranging their hands. Disputes can break out when a bean is in demand, a real treat to watch everyone bidding over a single bean, even better to watch someone begging to give one away for free. A very far cry from Rosenberg's most popular games, but my personal favourite. Everyone likes this one, a must for any collection.

30-45m, best with 3-5 players. 10+ plays.

Rules are pretty easy to follow, but extensive and took some getting used to.  Interestingly, BGG says it is an 8 and up game while the Rio Grande box says 12.  Based on how my daughter played, I'd say it's an 8 or 10.  It has become one of my seven-year-old's favorite games.  She never turns it down.

2017-11-11 : First play. Somehow we managed to not ever play this game until last Saturday. The reason that we only got to play this game 15 year after it was first released was that I didn't think I'd like it very much. But I was wrong. This is a very clever game of negotiation, reading people and playing the odds.

A fun card game that can draw people into the world of board games. The negotiating aspect of the game is where it's at, and the beans look cool! The fact that it forces you to plant beans at specific times makes the strategy in this game more important than one might think at first glance. Always love to play Bohnanza.

Once you've got your head around the need not to rearrange your hand cards, this is an interesting and fun negotiation game, in which you make lots of small trades rather than a few large ones. Quite a bit of luck involved I would say, but this reflects theme and playing time well.

RATING: 6
An easy card game to learn and teach.  It often takes a lot of effort to not re-arrange the cards that are in my hand though.  If you want to play a Negotiation game that isn't overly long and can accommodate a large number of players this would probably be the one that I would recommend.

Lots of interaction through trading, but it seems to me a dated-design. Theme is sort of silly, but the small-sized box means the game is portable. The strict hand order (cards cannot be realigned in your hand - honour system) is neat in theory, but doesn't seem to work all that well in practice (with certain players).  Also, it's sort of a dumb rule and I think there are better trading games to play instead for ages 13+.

First time through with 2p - good game mechanics, fun artwork, and fast play.  The read through of the rules gave pause...how could this be any fun at all?  But, once on the table, the stilted, awkward seeming rules evolved into a smooth, fun, very engaging bean farming experience. While fun with 2, glimpses of the potential for fun multi-player interactions (memories of family games of Pit) make me eager to play with a larger group.

Much more fun with four, five and six players! Now I understand the affection for this game.

RATING: 7.5
There are many games that have a trading element. Bohnanza forces players to trade, a lot, it they want any chance at winning. 

Some complain that Bohnanza is mostly luck. While there is a lot of luck, a player's skill in trading is very important. This may not typically be considered a skill in most games. Victories may be attributed to luck, that in actuality should be attributed to trading skill.

This wasn't on my wishlist but I was at Games By James at Mall of America with some time to blow while my daughter waited for her American Girl doll to get her ear's pierced.  And, well, you know....selection wasn't great but I couldn't leave without getting something.  So it was between this and Felix the Cat in the Sack and the Axis and Allies Anniversary Edition.  Felix requires 3.  Axis costs too much.  Problem solved.  Bohnanza it is!

Looking forward to trading beans with my kids.  :-)

Pros
--Game engages every player every turn of the game (phone-during-game deterrent?)
--Creates a story/rivalries through deals that did or did not happen

Cons

--A little long for how simple the game is

Overall, this game isn't so bad.  I don't see all the "hilarity and fun" that people are talking about when playing, although the trading and coaxing can be a boon.

Bohnanza does a great job sucking out all the negative vibes from the negotiation genre. The idea that winning in Bohnanza (at least in my group) requires a level of niceness- but not too much or too little- is nothing short than a breakthrough. If this game was what American families played, I think America would be a lot more game friendly.

Very interactive and chaotic game with an unusual mechanic for the order of the cards in your hand, that I found rather hard to teach, it being often considered as a typical gateway game. The helpful play mats in the BGG file section help a lot to bring some order to the game. There are other card games that our gaming group likes a lot better.

RATING: 6
I like trading games, and this isn't a bad one, but it has one fatal flaw - it's too luck dependent to be a serious strategy game, but it's too long and complicated to be a light fun game to pull out with a group of non-gamers.

It's not the the rules are really super complicated, but they are very unintuitive, which makes it really hard for someone who isn't accustomed to wrapping their head around it.  Once you do, they work well, and create a good play experience.  But there is a learning curve.

For serious gamers, of course, the learning curve is no problem - it simpler than most serious strategy games. But with serious gamers, I would rather be playing a serious strategy game.  I got this to play with non-gaming friends and relatives, and for them it is really a bit too daunting.  

Still, if you can get past that, and find a group for which it works, it's reasonably fun.

[5 plays] A jolly card game.  Don't be put off by the strange bean farming theme; it's basically a trading game.  I like the unusual mechanism of not being able to rearrange your cards and having to plant them in the order drawn.  When you read the rules and it says to go through the deck three times, you may think the game will be long, but on the second and even more on the third time through, there will be so many fewer cards in the deck that it really zips along.  The game is well-produced, though I really don't care for some of the more crudely humorous art.  The only thing I really don't like about the gameplay is the way the bean cards double as gold.  This means that beans are subtracted from the deck whenever anyone earns some gold.  This either messes up the otherwise-clearly-known card distribution in random, unpredictable, and mostly unknown ways, or, if people are really attentive to this and manipulate it deliberately (though there's very limited scope to do so), it adds screwage and memory elements that don't seem to really belong to this game.

Great card game about trading and collecting sets of beans then "harvesting" them for various amounts of coins. The player with the most coins at the end of the game wins. The trading mechanics coupled with the player's set hand order makes this game shine. You see, the cards in your hand must stay in the order in which they were dealt. On your turn you must play the first card in your hand. So it is often to your advantage to trade cards in your hand to other players for nothing in return. That way the cards in your hand are useful and in a favorable order. 

At least in my group this was a very light game. Players were generous with their trading so everyone got the particular bean they were going for at the time. I don't think you can get too greedy with trading in this game because if you don't get rid of unmatched cards you will be forced to harvest often with minimal gain.

The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them. To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making. One of the most unique features of the game is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A set collection game with a twist. The restriction on reordering your hand of cards makes negotiation and trading extremely important. You [i]have[/i] to help other players if you are to have any chance of winning, but such help must be carefully regulated. This adds an interesting element of negotiation that makes it much more interactive than typical set collection games.

This is a great little social game. It's super easy to understand so I bring it out for groups of non-gamers. It's also a very friendly game, with everyone helping everyone else for the most part. It isn't really that competitive in that regard, as people are pretty unwilling to harvest fields early, so cards are gifted fairly often. This could be annoying for some competitive players who don't want to play that way, but I haven't had problems. I figure I may if I tried to play this game to win.

It can get frustrating but it's a fun frustration (especially with a good interactive crowd).

A quirky game that upends some established traditions.  You have a hand of cards, but you may not sort them.

Fun set collection and negotiation game.  Works well with more than four people.  Don't ever play this game with a newly dating couple--too many opportunities for couples to "cheat" by preferring trades with their date for emotional rather than game advantage reasons.  

Have noticed that groups of women in particular enjoy this game -- probably because there's a communal aspect of benefiting your neighbor through trades at the same time as you try to do well yourself.

Bean farming at it's best.  One of the earliest games I was introduced to in the board game hobby and a game I still get to the table at just about every board gaming event I hold.  Some would say Agricola or Caverna are Uwe's best games, but this game wins in my opinion.  Also, the edition I have handles a lot of people surprisingly well.  Be aware, this game can take a while if you have a larger group and the expansions all seem to make the game longer as well.

Good trading and good party game. Can be played very nicely to people, thus my daughters and son like it. However, this is a real adult game if you play it aggressively with winning in mind. 3/1/2008: Taught my wife to play. She played to finish with me and son. 5/3008: My daughters (9&7) are able to be nice to others with a self-serving agenda behind.

RATING: 8
Based on 24 plays.
+ Very good scalability. (With two players, the game is different, though) Even with 7 players, you have something to do (negotiating) most of the time.
+ Negotiation is not mandatory, but helps to play better. It's not necessary for all players to like negotiations.
> It has a silly theme. (I like, at least)
> Causes loud conversations.
- Illustrations are not of my liking (They are funny, though.)
- Includes some non-intuitive mechanics (for example, cards in hand may not be reordered).

I played this game wrong about 10 times, and I still enjoyed it.  But now that I know the 1 beanfield rule and I've realized that you don't have to accept donations, I like it even more.  I thought it would be less interesting in a less cutthroat form, but the lack of blackmail and the addition of strong negotiating positions really helps.

Personally I think this game is generally over-rated. It's good, but not that good. Has spawned numerous expansion and variants. *** Played again after some years, with better (much nicer) people, and I enjoyed it a lot more. Not as hard as I recall. *** Played again, won again, liking it more, but I'm now thinking that there's not much to it. It is feeling slightly thin to me. As long as people trade, it ticks along well. We made a mistake by trading cards we had just received in trades. Maybe I need to play this against more experienced players.

We play this one all the time.  It's a good interactive game and gets better with more people.  The interesting thing about this game, to me, is that you can't alter the order of your hand, forcing you to trade cards out of your hand in order to move needed cards to the front (and thereby allowing you to play them sooner).  One of the better $11 purchases I've ever made on anything.

Though longer than most card games, Bohnanza is the gold standard, best card game ever.[/b]

:star: bright, colourful, amusing visuals
:star: highly social trading game
:star: not a simple ruleset, but excellent payoff of ruleset vs interesting gameplay
:star: appeals to non-gamers and gamers who enjoy trading/negotiation
:star: plays up to 7 players

- a bit long for a card game of this type (but you probably won't notice)
- teach this to non-gamers is tough because of two rules: the no-rearranging rule, and the four-steps-sequence
- the 2p variant in the rules is quite terrible

GREAT NON-GAMER GAME! This is a classic, and the great intro-to-'German' card game. 2-player version lacks something, but the multiplayer game is good enough that I still enjoy playing. After playing this game with more than 30 people on different occasions, I actually played this with a gamer who didn't like it -- the first one. ((Bought from F.))

There isn't much to dislike here.  The goofy artwork charms everyone and the free wheeling and dealing makes for chaotic play.  Rousing fun in trying to get the right combinations of beans planted.  Oh the agony of deciding if that 3rd field is worth it!  My only concern is the sometimes difficult rule to implement in who initiates trades (supposedly the current player but sometimes from table talk it gets murky).  But besides that, there is so much fun to be had.  Bean there and will go again.

RATING: 9
Great starter game, though I'd happily play it multiple times in the one sitting. Can get a game started after only 5 mins explanation, if that. It's probably easier just to do a practice round before starting a proper game. Most times people end up laughing and having a lot of fun with this, particularly during trading. The one trouble with trading is that sometimes it can take a long time for people to make decisions.

I hate Coffee beans.

[15+ plays] There are certainly things to think about, but what gets traded is usually a matter of luck depending on what you've got to trade, and what situation the other person is in - kind of a glorified Go Fish.

[Trading, Set Collection, Hand Management] [6P:3: 5P:3, 4P:3] Decent set collection and trading game, but really works best with six players who know how it goes and aren't shy about trading. As exciting as watching paint dry if no one wants to trade. *** UPDATE: Replays aren't kind to Bohnanza. It suffers from the "this again?" syndrome, where turns and games blur into one big mess and there isn't a decent gaming memory to be had from the whole morass. Yes, it's ok to pull it out when the clueless nongaming newbies come to visit, but every game is beginning to feel like Chinese Water Torture. "No, please, no more beans!! AAAAAAAHHHHH!" If it wasn't a gift I wouldn't own it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Must-have gateway game.  

People seem to really enjoy this, but only once they get past the unintuitive rules+mechanics, and each phase order on their turn and get their head around the fact that this is not exactly a party game. Pretty simple to teach and learn, and highly interactive because negotiations are absolutely necessary in this game. THE trading game to have. 
 
Not ingenious, not terribly deep, but still different, refreshing and fun. 

Tried the 2-player variant suggested in the Rio Grande edition. It works. Feels like a different game altogether, though. It took the negotiation aspect out, of course, but it turned into something that felt like Lost Cities with a twist: set collection + trying to not help the other player in your discards.

A great filler that takes a little too long and dries out. The first handful of games were crazy wheel-and-deal affairs with salesmanship of all kinds, but after the honeymoon period (probably 10 very fun plays) we all settled into a dull "audit every trade to stop anyone from getting a leg up" strategy. Also, the late game can really drag: everyone sits around with a hand full of cards they don't want to/can't efficiently move, and fields they're happy to leave stagnant if they can just wait out the end without giving anyone else an opening. Still recommended, especially with non-gamers. One of the chief remaining thrills is finding insidious ways to fleece friends who've never played before.

One of the toughest games to rate in my collection. I look at games I've rated above it and can't say I've gotten nearly as much fun out of many of them as out of Bohnanza. The flaws do nag though.

A medium weight card game with a twist that you can't rearrange your hand, you have to play cards in the order you draw them.  I enjoy this game more with fewer people.

The best negotiation game I own. It's so fun to set up a complex multi-people trade and see that one player was lying and breaks the whole thing. Machiavellic.   Note: can be really dull when played with a group of "nice" players that don't assess the value of accepting a card.

It's all about trading skills. Family kind of game with simple mechanics(easy to teach and to grasp).

A funny negotiation card game. Nevertheless, it can become very boring during negotiation phase due to the large amount of time that people use trying to negotiate beans (cards). In fact, I won't play this without using a timer anymore.

In my experience, this works really great with children between 8 to 13 years.

Bohnanza is all about trading, plus a bit of hand management. As such, it is also probably one of the most sociable games around. You won't get a lot more interaction without resorting to an all-out brawl. Collector types will even like to play this when they are losing, and it's pretty great to introduce new people to the hobby as well. Best with 4+ players, and a lot of its flair depends on having the right group. If people don't like to barter it will be getting stale pretty quickly.

Incredible card game from Uwe Rosenberg.
The art is an acquired taste, but the hand management forcing you to not re order the cards in your hands mixed with the trading aspect and the set collection aspect (plating beans) makes this card game an instant classic to my family.
Always ready to play it.

When playing it with the orders addition from high bohn and the extra beans and mafia cards and 2-player rules from Al Cabohne makes it the perfect light game (not a filler since it often takes more than an hour) for me and my girlfriend. The only game she never says no when proposed for a play.

This game is a blast, a great trading game involving anthropomorphic beans. Quick set-up, intense negotiations, and stink beans.

I like the part when people start arguing.

One of my favorite games when played with at least 4 people, because I love the interaction that comes with trading. Trying to negotiate a good deal is something I love in games, and since hand management is an integral part to the game, another aspect I like, being able to get or get rid of cards you need through talking someone into a deal is really, really enjoyable.

This has all the elements of a great game: simple rules and forced interaction with other players. Make the most money growing your bean fields before the game ends is the theme. The key issue is that you have to work with each other to be able to optimize your fields. 

It's been a while since I have played, and my enthusthiasm for the game has cooled with that time away from it.

A classic Uwe Rosenberg card game.  There is one weird twist, you cannot rearrange the order of your hand.

Plus, this game is fast and simple and fun for 6 players.

The use of hand order is a clever, albeit unintuitive, way to introduce variable card value to the game which is very condusive to its trading. Unfortunately, trading and bartering gets kind of long winded when that's basically all that happens in the game.

I had a really hard time rating this game.  On one hand, it is pretty simple.  Yet, my group has played and continues to request this game more than any other in our collection.  The player interaction is fantastic.  This is the only game we've played so much that I may actually need to buy a new deck of cards!

Update: We haven't played this one in a while, ready to bring it out again.  

Update 2: Played 7 player game with 4 new people/nongamers.  Dragged a bit, but it worked and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  This game has serious legs.

Uwe Rosenberg hits it early out of the park with this one! Bohnanza meshes together everything I like about card games: auctioning, trading, risk, set collection.  Just puts it all together in one brilliantly satisfying game. Yeah, at its core it is still a push-your-luck game, and your card draws can either seriously hinder you or benefit you without any personal influence; but the way the cards are played out is just so brilliant that I can't imagine giving this anything other than an '8'.

I rate Bohnanza in two distinct ways, as a negotiation game, and as a gateway game.  In the latter I think Bohnanza offers a wonderful introduction to games beyond Monopoly, as it presents players with new mechanics and strong interaction. However, I sometimes find the game feels long and repetative, almost dragging at points; as this game, like most negotiation games, needs all players to be cunning and a bit cut throat.  With that said Bohnanza can be a blast, even with seasoned players but it lacks that certain something that Traders offers me. Could it be the feel of progression, and the varying options? Maybe.  Bohnanza over all is a fun time and a game I am not often going to turn away. I find the expansions pointless, and only detract from this unique original game.

RATING: 8
This was one of the first (possibly the very first) "Euro" game I ever had the pleasure of playing, and my wife and our friends became obsessed with it for quite a while. It's definitely the most fun I've ever had with a pure trading game, but like other trading-heavy game experiences (Settlers) play can lead to some... ah... tensions... when folks feel slighted in trades, and of course the strongest personality tends to win in these sorts of games, but you get what you get with trading games.

Bohnanza's most ballyhooed feature is its hand constraint - cards must be kept in the order in which they were drawn, and they come out in order, first-in-first-out. This is cool and different and all, but it's also essential to the game, don't let any rebellious players bully you into changing it!

Overall, "Beans" is really a blast to play, and is a rare great game that can be played with 6 or 7 after very little "teaching", making it a great "party game alternative" if you want to introduce non-gamers to more substantial fare.

This game would be too simple, except for one neat twist:  The cards that you're trying to create sets from must be played in the order you pick them up.  Another great introductory game; the extra bit of thought that's required of players shouldn't stump anyone.  A great game with 4 or 5, it comes with rules for as few as 2.  Because of the degree of player interaction required (you will not win this game if you try to rely solely on your own hand), expect a fairly long game if you play a 6- or 7-player game--at that point, it loses its "intro" appeal.

Would you believe that planting beans could be so addictive. Trading or giving away cards in your hand that interfere with plantings is the key to success. Giving cards away for free is so contrary to normal trading games that it is hard to do when you first learn how to play the game. After considerable time and numerous plays I am less enamored with this game. Its good but i dont think that it is 10 good so my rating decreases to 9. Sometimes games sort of run their course. I think that this one has. Its rating decreases again. Maybe we have played this too often. Played this many many times before I started to keep track of plays here on the Geek

Another game that I really wanted to like but just didn't.  Of the ~15 people I have played this game with, 1 really liked it, 2-3 enjoyed it, and the rest ranged from "meh" to dislike.  The people I play with range from hardcore gamers to casual couple gamers.  I gave this game to a friend who plays with another gaming group.  They have the same opinion.

For me, the game takes WAY too long to go through the deck 3 times.  Twice seems to be about the right length.  Even then though... most people want the game to be over once through the deck.  That is a sign that people are not into the game.

This game came highly recommended online and it was cheap... so it seemed like a no brainer.  Oh well...

This is a perfect social game. I've played it with 5 or less people many times. ALWAYS fun. The game is brilliant. It's so satisfying to come up with new trades and bribes and bargaining approaches. It honestly never gets old. Everyone who has played this game loves it. The pattern seems to be: I take it over to a friends to play a round, they end up buying a copy.

There is A LOT of constant player to player interaction, and no down time between turns because you're usually trying to make deals with the active player. No hard feelings in the end, it's always within a few gold of each other, no one feels like a loser. Best with 3 or more. Easy to teach, quick to pick up and learn.

Amazing game, but my gaming groups really don't get the competition aspect. Everyone's more interested in working together to get undesired beans out of their hands to keep their fields under control, rather than trying to maximize and make a profit in trade in the hopes of actually winning (or at least doing well). Yikes.

We love this silly game.  My kids love the fan edition & all the silly comments.  My husband & I love all the negations.  We are softer on deals with the kids so they usually end up winning!  My Mom, a non-game player, doesn't get it at all & thinks it's a waste of time.

We first played the fan edition at a friends house.  Earlier versions of the fan edition had some alarming cards (a dominatrix, topless bikini etc.) my kids were too young for those.  We got the fan edition for Christmas 2010 from friends & thankfully there have been changes to some of the cards.  There not any in our set we felt we needed to substitute.  However they did not put the names or counts of the beans on the cards either.  Fine for our family but when someone new plays with us they get confused.

We are having fun with this game.  It takes patience to teach the game but after watching a few rounds they "got it" and loved it.  I think we will ask for this game next time.  There are moment where the trading takes to long, otherwise it is an engaging interactive game. 

8 years olds understand this game and can play it well(and have fun!) 6-7 players seems to go by much too fast.

After a couple of plays I'm leaning toward eventual ownership of this unique set collection card game of which you can never have too many.

A very cool family/party game, where players are trying to collect different sets of beans, by means of hand management, trading and donating cards to each other.

The game is pretty easy to teach/learn, in just a few minutes. Good interaction amongst players and a few laughs as well.

[Original comment] A fun family game. We recently added the High Bohn cards, which adds more depth to the game. Great game for 5 to 7 players.

(December 2007) We play this now with 8 players and find it to be excellent for our family group. Only a couple of us enjoy the High Bohn expansion, so it doesn't get played these days.

May 2009 -- This is still one of our family favorites, and is played more often than any other game we own.

October 2011 -- We have enjoyed this game for many years and have had to replace several decks of cards. It is still one of the most popular of our games for our family group.

2013-November: This continues to be one of the most-played games in our collection.

Hugely enjoyable negotiating and trading game with a fun theme.

Great fun.

Very casual fun experience. Very easy to get non-gamers into with high interactions.

Edit 2015: games run just a little bit too long to be casual play, and mechanics are a bit too abstract for non-gamers to fully have fun with (no hand movement, trading can be finicky, rule about 1-bean fields not being harvestable). Very little highs and lows, but casual enough to play with anyone.

Bought in February 2014.

OK, there's kind of a weird reason this has gone unplayed for a couple of years. I feel BETRAYED by this game.

I've had some great times with it - but then I discovered I was playing a rule wrong (for years!). And I like the game less with the rule fixed.

We missed that you can only harvest two or more beans - single bean fields can't be harvested unless you have no other option.

I suspect it might better played wrongly. Much easier to teach, gives you more options, makes the 3rd bean field a more balanced decision, encourages more generosity with trades (because you can accept a single card intending to immediately overplant it). For me, playing it wrongly helps reinforce what makes it fun; whereas playing correctly takes away from that.

Namely, the genius of this game is that it encourages you to be generous with trades - even to the point where you'll willingly donate cards to help other players. Which means you never get stuck in a [thing=13]Settlers of Catan[/thing]-like situation where someone insists on unreasonable trades and slows the game down.

One day I'll forgive it and play it again. But play it right or keep playing it wrong? I don't know!

The main downside is that it can run a little long. I'm not sure how much the effect on gameplay would be of only going through the deck once (rather than three times), but that might make it the perfect length.

Very fun card game with nice and simple trading mechanic.

Pros:
+ Quite simple gameplay and good mechanics,
+ Nice and fun artwork, quality components (cards),
+ Theme is fun and great (farming themes are great, because they are realistic and educational in this urbanized world),
+ Trading phase makes this game fun and interactive,
+ Although game has some random chance, the order in which the cards must be kept, fixed hand management and trading chance makes this game much more strategic than random,
+ Small box which makes this game suitable for traveling around.

Cons:
- Rules are different for player variations - of course, that was made for balance, however the two player game is significantly different and does not include any trading,
- The card order keeping and some rules at the beginning is hard to get and corectly implement which makes it not very easy to explain to beginners and there are some confusing rules,
- Players should be perfectly honest in this game, otherwise the game isn't fair. Trading phase could be improved with more strict rules to avoid dishonest trading deals.

Terrific trading game with broad appeal, although it sometimes seems to last a bit too long. One of my top choices for introducing non-gamers to this hobby of ours (if I can get them to look past the game's oh-so-thrilling theme of bean farming).  If you have the German edition, be sure to get the Erweiterungs Set, which tweaks the card mix according to the number of players, greatly improving the game balance.  Plays well with any number of players from three to seven, although I like it best with four or five.  With lots of players, you have to fight hard to acquire the beans you want.  With fewer players, the struggle is often just to get rid of the beans you *don't* want.

The kids love this one...well, for now anyway! And now so does my wife, more than any of us. The wheeling and dealing of the cards can be fun and painful depending on which end of the deal you're on; especially not taking cards off others which they want to give you and will not effect you in any adverse way, but if they keep the card/s they will have to plant them and wreck their other plantings. Sometimes like most card based games you may feel you're getting bad cards. However so many cards are drawn that it seems to even out well if you keep to your strategy. We play 3 player in about 45 minutes but 5 is more fun.

Edit:  I originally gave the game an 8 after playing the 2-player version.  The game really gets going with 4 players.  One of the best games ever.

RATING: 6
A decent game for 4 or 5 players. With 6 or 7 it overstays its welcome, because the negotiations take too long to reach an end. With 3 players there is the opposite problem: not enough people to negotiate with. Forget about it with 2 players: it is boring as hell.

People seem to really get into it from the first play, but since the mechanism is always the same, it wore out after a dozen plays. Not enough meat here to become a keeper.

People always ask me what could be fun in a game about farming beans, but after they play no one ever seems to dislike it.

RATING: 8
In our group this is called “the bean game” for obvious reasons. If you look past the silly theme for the game (which however is well integrated) there are quite some interesting decisions. What makes the game is that you can’t reorganize your hand, since that will make you trade away beans that will be away in your hand. If you do it properly and other players are willing you don’t need the third bean field.

I like the free wheeling and dealing in this game as it is to the point and players usually know what other players will want to have. In other games these kinds of decisions can drag the game out, but it seems to be more concentrated here. This isn’t a heavy game by any stretch and there is a lot of luck involved, but at the same time it is a player driven game.

I found it to play best with four or five players. With more players there are too much beans in play making the decisions more trivial and with less there seems to be too little chaos.

I've played with the maximum and the minimum and enjoy them both. I've played the "official" 2-player rules included with the game and our own same-rules-as-for-more-players variant and enjoy them both. I've played with family and youth group kids and have enjoyed them both. So basically, I've thoroughly enjoyed this game! I like the interaction, the silly artwork and the entire premise of farming beans. It's always a hoot to introduce it to people who ask what the game is about: "Bean farming!" I always say with a smile.

Lots and lots of plays (like, maybe 30 or 40?); this was one of the first "German" games I bought, and we played the heck out of it. Every non-gamer I've introduced it to has loved it. One thing, though: I've come to realize that I MUCH prefer the original Amigo version with the smaller deck. The game outstays its welcome with all the extra cards in the American version. Also,  I feel like six players is too many, though three works quite well, believe it or not. I would rate the Rio Grande version a 5.

Played 2+ Generally the pushiest player will get the deals necessary to win. It is all harmless fun and would be an ok game if it didn't take an hour or so to play with 5 players. I am noticing a trend; I don't like card games that take as long to play as the quicker strategy board games. Bohnanza, Citadels and Sherlock Holmes are all ok but in each case I would rather spend the same period of time playing; Web of Power, Ra, Carcassonne etc. Guillotine on the other hand I like to play as the other choice is we all go home early.

Often lost on players of this game is that it is not a game about planting beans. It is a game about negotiating with competitors to get what you want and to get rid of what will hurt you.

It’s a good game but more simple. It is a very social game. You sit and communicate with everyone. You know what I mean? You ask all the different players for a card that you need… Trying to intercept some cards… That’s what interesting!

I'm just not a fan of this game.  I don't like the trading and everyone keeping track of "favors" for getting cards.  The trading aspect slows the game down a lot with certain people and the game drags.  My group likes it so I reluctantly play it when I have to.

This game is a ten for me! I never get tired of playing this,the artwork if fantastic,its thematic and you can get it to a very crazy level with the negotiation aspect!As long as you dont do anything against the rules all deals can utake place.It is surely a slight random based game,some times more than others, but the negotiations can make you a winner.I win like 80% of the games or more.Maybe for some is a 7-8 but i just like it so much and the mechanics are pretty interesting and drive you to desperate decisions to make up the right plan for you.If you like economy negotiation games its surely for you, alot of talk and interaction through decisions.

Very fun game, especially with a lot of people!

Perhaps my favourite game of all-time.

That it's a trading game makes it very easy for newcomers to grasp (and is thus an excellent introduction to "these games of ours") as well as keeping all players involved throughout.

I *strongly* recommend playing with no more than five players and removing the 4s, 22s, and 24s from the English-language version (they make the game outstay its welcome).

An interesting little trading card game with the added twist of not being able to rearrange your hand once dealt. Quite enjoyable and pretty quick once everyone knows what they are doing. Probably best suited to around 4 or 5 players though.

Edit: Just found out that we've been playing this game wrong for over a year. That's what happens when I don't read the rules for myself and just take someone else's word for it! Not the first time this has happened either so I should have learned my lesson. In any case I actually don't like the game as much with the correct rules and have dropped it's rating down accordingly.

Edit: Still a great game now I've had time to get used to the proper rules, but can be slightly long for what should be a filler game.

Rating for 3+ players (found 2-player a bit 'meh').

A game that keeps you constantly engaged, throws frequent 'should-I, shouldn't I?' decisions at you, and keeps the whole table talking. Just great fun. Worked magnificently with my non-gaming parents, and is jostling with Ticket to Ride as the default game to introduce people to the hobby with (only the game length prevents it being automatic winner).

Shy of being a nine mainly because with such narrow scoring margins, a few lucky draws can skew the game in a player's favour (the other players' trading power should be able to rebalance it, but it's hard to tell the difference between piles of 'coin' cards with only a few cards between them).

I have had some really fun sessions playing this game.  This has some wonderful player interactivity.  This will be one of my go-to games for a non-gaming, but lively, crowd.

Has type of luck as any other card game.  The interesting constraint is that of playing your hand like a queue (cards must be played from the front of your hand and drawn cards must be added at the back of your hand).  You may however, trade away cards that you don't want in your hand.  These two things together create a situation that really compels you trade pretty agressively at times.  So things can get pretty animated!

Great fun with the right crowd.  People who complain about its lack of depth are missing the point.  People who complain about the game dragging on to long should just end the game the first or second time the draw deck is depleted.  People who complain about not liking trading games shouldn't play trading games.  If you ever play games with a group of non-gamers, Bohnanza is a no-brainer, especially with its $15 (or less) price tag.

When I bring it over to my friends' place, it is commonly referred to as "The Bean Game" but in this slightly silly game is a very good negotiation and collection game.  I absolutely love going trying to out-negotiate another player trying to get the same type of bean from a player.  It's pretty light, has lots of player interaction, and plays in about an hour, so definitely a thumbs up here.

I have certainly cooled to this game over time because it sometimes takes too darn long....

This is a pretty fun one.  Its great with a group of friends, very fast paced and involved.  My friends like it more than I do.  I don't know what it is, but there's just something I don't enjoy about this seemingly great game.

I increased my rating from 7 to 8 because the more I play this game, the more I like the level of its player interaction and the fact that you&#039;re always in the game whether it&#039;s your turn or not. In fact, you do most of the useful things when it&#039;s not your turn! Easy to teach and great social game.

A masterclass in design. Including the part in which you shouldn't make your game last 30 minutes longer than it should. It is amazing, it uses compulsions to create superb incentives to trade, but also good reasons not to. A triumph of minimalism, which just needs to end about 30 minutes sooner.

Played the two player version.  Not terribly interesting, but lets you see just how good the game might be with 3 or more (which allows trading.  The two player game I would probably rate a 5 or 6, but I'll wait and play the full game before actually awarding a score.  I imagine it will be more like a 7 for the full game, the trading just seems like it will add a lot of hand management strategy on top of the interesting trading ability

We bought this game based on comments here and on other sites and we are very happy with our copy, it was definitely worth it. 
Pretty much player interaction but due to this fact it requires the right people as well (our second session wasn't nearly as enjoyable as the first because some people just weren't the right ones for this game).
We love the theme (yes, we love it :)), the graphics, the basic idea, everything. Hope to play much more :)

Good entry-level game as a few rules can be explained and the rest can be filled in once everyone starts playing.  It can be customized to fit tighter schedules by reducing the cards in the deck, but adds a bit more luck into the game, as there is less time for strategy to pay off.

A tough one to rate. Gets its rating from the fact that almost everyone I play with loves it, and it has some highly innovative mechanics. Can't help feeling like the luck is very overriding though. More experienced players do not necessarily, or even more often, win. I guess the bartering is what this game is really all about, but most people i play with are so laid back that diplomacy isn't really an issue. Still, worth a play and even worth owning.

A Rosenberg classic that doesn't play much like the games he's famous for now, this simple game still provides a huge amount of entertainment. The way it incentivizes trading is just brilliant. The expansions for it have largely panned out as unneeded but I'd like to give them another try eventually.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Simple to teach and quick to play.  There is little down time because each player has to pay attention to possible trades at all times.  Bohnanza is still one of the best trading games ever designed.  The unique rule of not being able to re-order cards is off-putting to new players, but after a couple of rounds, they quickly get the hang of it.  Knowing when to cash out of a bean type is key to winning.  Nearly every game has come down to only a few points separating first and second (one reason that I never buy the third bean field).

I've played with player counts from 3 to 7.  While 3 is ok, it is not optimum.  4 is better, but the game plays best at 5 or 6

The scores are often very low (15-20 points) and close in this game, often ending in a tie.  It sometimes seems like lots of work (making offers for trades) for little reward.

This is an unusual game in that each player's hand of cards is a FIFO queue. There are times that it's meaningful to donate a card to another player for free, just to get rid of the card that must be played next and to free up the subsequent cards.  Similarly, trading a card for the identical card is also useful at times, because traded cards can come from anywhere in one's hand.

Very enjoyable trading game. Although simple the rules can seem confusing due to the interaction of steps. Players are so used to moving cards around in there hands that when you present them with a game that stops you playing or changing the position of cards they get a little flustered. Good Game, plenty of options for trading.

Bean planting game. 

Best recommended with 4+ players.

Players MUST play cards in order from their hand and MUST plant at least one bean(card) from their hand and may plant a second bean if they want. 

Draw and display two bean cards and discuss with other players if they want the bean. Otherwise you will be forced to plant those beans. Players may coordinate to trade cards from their hand from any order to help them time their bean planting.

This is a game with lots of trading and interaction for micro managing your fields. I have not played 7 players before and would definately find it amusing if I say myself. 

Like the idea, but the time displayed on the box varies depending on the players and how long each player takes to trade their beans hahaha!

Fun party game but remember trading is crucial in this game!

After playing the game with a variety of players and player numbers, I still really like this game.  Light hearted, easy to learn fun for all.  The games feel like they go on a little longer than they should for what they are but because you're conversing, wheeling and dealing, it's not as bad as I once thought.

That'd be the only downside - it's a lot of luck and trading that takes a bit too long for the simplicity.  Very fun game though, great for gamers and non-gamers alike.

RATING: 9
This excellent little game packs a lot of decision and play into a pack of cards!  I have the Bohnapart and HighBohn expansions, and have not played them yet.  

The game itself is simple, but the enjoyment comes from player interraction.  This is the closest to a cooperative game as any competition can get, and it really works on your trading skills.  I have found very few people (gamers and non-gamers) who do not enjoy the game. 

As you harvest, the deck gets smaller, which drastically changes end-game tactics as well as accelerates the game end.  I have to constantly tell new players that the rules of "Shuffle and play through the deck 2 more times" will go much faster than they would expect.  (In most cases, the last 2 shuffles take significanly less time than the first one alone!)

Downside:  It is so difficult to keep people from rea-aranging their hands.  I bought 8 "kiddy" card hand holders (the circular type) and enforce thier use to help prevent hand arrangements.  Also, some people want a tactical game with little player involvement and this is definitely not their game.  Finally, the Bohnapart expansion turns this into a board game, and I frankly don't see the point to that and will probably never play it for that reason.

Too agressive, chaotic and random. You try to build something with your cards, but you don't have much influence on your destiny. Additionally, if you manage to achieve anything over the average, others may easily got you out of the game.

Works something better (rather, sucks little less) without the "must destroy developed field" rule.

Fun & funny, though the game itself is just a coupling device for amusing minds.  It would be hideous with the humorless.  It's all in the metagame, arguing why a given trade should or shouldn't happen, and attempting to craft the sweetest deal.

I expect the rating to rise with further play.

Great artwork and a requirement to negotiate are the strong points of Bohnanza.  The theme is questionable at best, but then there is only so much you can do with a card game about set collection!  I have only played once so far, and this may well improve with age.

Egyszerű de szórakoztató kártyajáték. Két babfölden kell különféle fajtájú babokat termelni, de mindig új babok jönnek és akkor a régit le kell aratni még akkor is, ha nem hoz megfelelő terményt. Ezt úgy tudjuk csak megakadályozni, hogy azokat a babokat amikre nincs szükségünk elcseréljük. Általában ez a szabadon megválasztott csere-bere eléggé be tudja lassítani a játékokat, de nem itt. A Bohnanzában ez pörgősen, jól működik.

RATING: 1
Disgraceful. Another example of somebody who clearly knows that Bonanza is the name of my show and used--"stole" the name to generate clicks for people hoping that they made another game about our family. The cute thing is they changed the spelling so people wouldn't complain. Well they still complain. If you make a game about the Ponderosa then you can use "Bonanza" or whatever bogus spelling you care for.

For me this is THE trading game par excellence, one that has never quite made my purchase list, even though it probably deserves to. The humourous art work is perfect for keeping things light and overall this has just the right playing time. Really needs to be played with at least 5, otherwise some beans are simply not in demand and then luck of the draw becomes a bigger factor. Pleasant, light fun with a little frustration when you need to trade, but don't have the right card to secure a deal.

Who knew that planting beans can be so much fun ?!? :) Awesome card game with a couple of clever tricks (playing cards in receiving order + negotiation/trading phase) that make it head and shoulders above the rest. Gameplay is very fun and relaxing, and in spite of being advertised as a 3-5P game, works like a charm as a 2P game as well. It takes just 1 game to get you seriously hooked on it!

Good card game to play with non-gamers (just keep an eye on them to make sure they aren't automatically rearranging the cards in their hand without thinking). I invariably try to be too cut-throat, which means no-one will trade with me and I come last.
With more experienced gamers, I doubt I'd ever suggest it: but there's fun to be had there and it's easy to teach.

For me Boonanza is all about frustration, I'm not the best deal-maker and most of the time I am not capable of getting good trades with fellow players. But that is what makes it a good game for me, it's exciting to see what cards you'll get and how it will all play out. You can get Lucky with your cards and won't need to trade at all on your way to victory but most of the time that's not the case. This game is more about playing your opponents and tricking them for your advantage than it is a game about playing cards. This game sat unplayed on my shelves for a little under a year, but it definetly deserves more attention. It's quick and fun.

I can never get into the win at all costs mode with this game.  For me, there is just too much generosity when it comes to trading/donating.  It's an enjoyable game now and then but not something I would want to play if I am in my competitive mode.

Todo un clásico, me encanta sus ilustraciones y se tiende a memorizar todos los nombres. Es un juego que se necesita de plantar y cosechar frijoles, requiere de negociar y comerciar con el resto de los jugadores, en ocasiones se necesita de hacer crecer los cultivos de los oponentes para no perder los de uno.

Un juego divertido, pero se necesita de poner tiempo límite a las negociaciones, en especial con bastantes jugadores. Le he agregado un par de expansiones que le dan diversidad y ofrecen otros modos de juego.

First played Oct 23rd, 2007. This is a quick learn 5min to learn 45min to play for 5-6 players. This is a negotiation game. Everyone is given a number of cards to start the game with (3-6). On your turn you must play/plant your top card and may play the second top card. Next you turn over the top two cards from the deck and use them or auction/trade them off. Sometimes you may want to simply give them away because you will have to plant them if you can't give them away, potentially forcing an early sell of an existing bean, possibly for zero. For the 3rd phase of your turn you draw 4 cards to refill your hand. If you know someone who has it, give it a try, otherwise I wouldn't bother.

Plays extremely well. The good thing is that the mechanics are so straightforward that the heart of the game, where most time is spent is in free form trading. This one is always fun, but given that it's not very competitive, it is too long for its own sake.

The reasons I am not rating this higher are:
1. After not that many sessions, I don't find myself eager to come for more.
2. Players can shut a player out and then the game just gets nasty - no fun at all. This is nastier than your typical leader bashing.

RATING: 5.5
Ideal Players: 4-6

Description: Plant your beans, and harvest them to get gold. Be careful, because you can only plant two types.

Pro: Light and easy. Fun bean art. Neat choices about whether to give away good beans or throw away beans already planted.

Con: Not much depth. Cards re-use the same art.

Nice negotiation game, suitable for all ages.  Simple trading mechanics hide rather complex strategies and potential bluffs as you try to collect sets of beans, the more of each type you collect the more money you get for that set.  Very simple but has good replayability and gets everyone involved on every turn, very little downtime.

bean trading, v. good sociable game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A pure trading game, with some of the most arbitrary mechanics I have seen. Why do I receive two free beans that I have to trade or plant? Why do I have to go through my hand in order? Why can't I just toss a bean instead of planting it? The answer to all of these questions is "So that the game will work." 

I like games with trading in them, but I also need something else to be working toward. Also, some correlation with the real world would be nice.

A fun card game that focuses on set collection and trading with your opponents.  It's quick and there's usually something to do even when it's not your turn.  The two-player game isn't very fun since there's no trading.  Great with four or more players.

This game requires specific group to be fun.  Otherwise it's quite schematic and lifeless.
To gather such a group is a challenge, so I do not desire to own this game.

Quite a light but good trading game with set collection that would be great as a gateway game and filler although it almost ran too long (easily fixable). This game doesn't forget to be fun and the silly theme  with funny looking pictures on the cards certainly contribute to that. I think it is important to engage in theme by say calling the cards that look like 'dickheads', dickheads making it a little more fun. Keeping your hand in the order you pick it up is tricky at first but essential to the game play. One of the better fillers I have played.

A little bit of analysis (figuring out how likely it is you'll get the bean you need), and a lot of negotiation (getting the beans you need from your opponents).  A simple, lively card game.  Because it's a trading game, it's subject to the moods and personalities of the players.

It took us far too long to get this to the table... The theme is what kept it away (bean farming? really?) but once we started playing the first time, Kel commented that she wished she wouldn't have turned down the game so many times in the past.  

I think this one is destined to be [b]the[/b] game we play when we have a bunch of people over.  There is soooo much interaction between all the players.  

The rules were a bit confusing at first, but after about two times around the table in our first game we were set and the game really flew...

The above may be a bit of a mistatement though as sometimes a player's turn can drag for a long time while particularly big deals are being made.  This doesn't strictly equate to downtime though, as you usually have to pay close attention to what people are trading in order to possibly try to wrangle yourself into a deal. For example, in most games I feel fairly comfortable getting up from the table to get a snack, check on the kids, or use the bathroom...  not so here as you never know what trade you might be missing out on (wait, did you say you were looking for red beans? well...).

I really enjoy this game. It works well with three players but better with four or more. Luck? Some, but it's balanced by skillful card play and good trading. Avoid all of the expansions, it doesn't get much better than this. It also makes a good and relatively cheap gift. This was in my lunchtime card group's rotation but they didn't care for it much so we haven't played it in years now. Still, it's sometimes hard to get people to play due to the theme.

Sometime after a heated game of Bohnanza I just HATE the people I played with and there are about 5 minutes where we all look like we're about to punch each other in the face.  Yet, unlike with most activities that inspire this sort of emotion, it never takes long for us to move on to something else and remember the game fondly.  My friends and I still recall the implications of the Garden Bean Debacle of '09 even though I no longer have any idea of how it started.  It takes a good game to leave such a lasting impression on its players.

Bohnanza is a solid choice for players getting into modern games. The interactive nature of the game - the wheeling and dealing for the best trade - provides the main appeal.

Good game, but one I'm rarely in the mood for.  My opinion has widely varied, and seems to depend on the number of players.

Jan '10 Time and again I come back to this simple card game. Teach it to friends, family, and strangers, and they all want to know where they can get it.

Dec '11 - well, I'm about two years further into gaming, and while I still love Bohnanza, it's not getting played, and that's mostly because I want to play other things. Better for a family style game than for game groups. Rating down from a nine to an eight.

I play the 2-player variant with my wife quite a lot, and I don't really enjoy it.  The most important aspect of the game - the card trading - is lost, meaning that your fate is highly dependent on what cards you draw.  The "flip three cards and pull matches out of the trash" rule can also be ridiculous at times.  If I cash out 12 Coffee Beans, then flip over a coffee bean (which is very likely), I end up getting eight of them back (four turned into gold).  This rule can make or break your game, and it's difficult to use tactically/strategically.  I'm really disappointed with games that throw in a 2-player variant that doesn't play at all like the core game.

As many have said, it's the most fun you'll ever have growing beans. It started off a little slow our first game, but after we figured things out everyone had a great time.

This one tops my list of, "games I played incorrectly that completely changed the feel of the game." We played several times before realizing you can't uproot a bean field with only one bean in it. (I didn't figure this out until I was reading an interview with the designer where he casually mentioned that rule.) Makes maintaining your fields much more difficult... but that's not a bad thing.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (August 2010)

Bohnanza is a brilliant negotiation game, however I almost never want to play it even though I love negotiating games. Weird uh? I have bought 3 copies of it and I have sold them all, in fact I still have an expansion but not the base game.  

Still I recognize and respect Bohnanza, it is a great game, easy to play and teach, it can accommodate a large number of players and it is perfect to introduce new gamers to our beloved hobby. It is very group dependent, if you like negotiation this is a must buy. (I will buy my fourth copy soon.)

As I almost never want to play it, I’m downgrading its rating so it matches the BGG rating system.

RATING: 8.5
I like this game. It's simple to explain and has a comfortable learning curve for most players. Basic strategy is made apparent early on in most games with new players. More complicated strategies exist but require some guesswork and risk-assessment. 

The theme is goofy but fun and accessible for the average person. It works from two to seven players but I feel most comfortable with 4-5 players. 

I'd suggest this game pretty quickly for non-gamers or new gamers. It's relatively quick with experienced players and still involved enough to include some strategic complications.

Edit:
I've moved it up a little because I find that it is increasingly requested and, yet, still very enjoyable for me.

Highly enjoyable. My wife and I have as much fun playing 2 player as we do multiplayer. 

A very easy game but a very difficult game to teach. The mechanics aren't difficult but for some reason it is hard to teach to people. It's also a little difficult to show them how fun it will be when they learn...a little hard sometimes convincing your beer swilling pals that this little "bean game" is going to be worth their while to learn.

If you can overcome the cutesy theme and the "not hard but tricky" mechanics/strategies of the game it's a real blast to play. It has become a family favorite and it's one of the few that my mother will actually request.

RATING: 6
This is a game that lives on the silliness that can ensue.  I haven't been able to play it with adults, since most of them scoff at the theme and dismiss it out of hand.  When I play with (middle school) kids, I find the game diverting, but not incredibly more so than gin or rummy.  It does work well with the kids, however.

Update:  I finally got to play this with adults.  After 5 plays in two weeks, I think the 6 rating is accurate.  It is too chaotic for my tastes, and even with adults, the trading tends to make the game too easy.  I think the latter complaint is the result of group-think (we could all choose to be more cut-throat in our trading), but everyone at the table must play that way for it to be viable.  Overall, it's so-so.

RATING: 8.5
Very tight design, with more layers than meets the eye. Play is a unique experience due to the frustration of needing to donate away cards you don't want to plant, and strategically not accepting donations. You're always feeling you're losing, and scores tend to be very close decided in the end-game. The negotiation is very controlled (only with dealer), which I like.  Going through the discards three times adds a deck-building aspect which often decides the game ("if I cash in x, it will come up again for others y time away").  A "brainy" family game that almost has a whiff of Knizia to it. And you use the back of cards to score, doesn't get more elegant.

Ever imagined you were a bean farmer? Sure, who hasn't. You got your red beans, your green beans, your black-eyed beans, your coffee beans. But where to plant them. In this card game, smart sowing lets you reap big rewards. Plant the beans you do want, and trade the beans you don't want to the other players. Adding to the realism of the game, the one who ends up with the most money wins.

Played heavily, but then we discovered Res Publica which now receives far heavier play.  Bohnanza is about trade in the face of oversupply.  Res Publica is trade in a situation of undersupply, both of desired commodities and information.  I tend to prefer games in which there are insufficient resources.

A favourite amongst one of my play groups. Plant bean cards in two fields - no mixing mind! Cards must be planted in the order they are added to your hand so trade (or give!) away the ones you don't want to maximise your profits.

Oh, and the artwork is fabulous!

Bohnanza is really awesome.  There's something so great about a card game where players are able to chat and make trades (or donations if you're me) and just allow time to pass in a really enjoyable card game.  I love the idea of forced planting and allowing for a second planting if wanted.  Add to that that really amazing way the cards push toward the front of your hand for planting, whether you want them to or not.  I really love this one.

Bean farming? For real? Well, it turns out this game is a hell of a lot of fun. The rules take mere seconds to explain and it consists of a deck of cards, so you could take it anywhere. It only takes a few turns to get a feel for how to get clunkers out of your hand to keep them from fouling up your queue. As such, you can demand things for free or even give them away for free as circumstances allow. 

The box suggestion of ages 12 and up seems overly cautious--I'm sure you could have a blast with younger kids.

Played this with 5 and it was a blast. Highly social with enough decision-making to keep it interesting. It's ostensibly a trading game, but with the ability to give cards away, the trading is very easy and does not bog down play with difficult negotiations. Usually the card you want is available from someone or it isn't.

The expansions look weird and unappealing to me.

Nice game, most of the fun comes from the trading part. At first I did not like the third field card, because I thought it is necessary to win. I found out several times that you can win without it as well. Many of the choices you have to make are obvious, but otherwise a good game. I played once with the expansion with 7 players. That went too slow and too chaotic. (27 nov 06 after 11 plays)

It's funny how you can be not very keen on a game mechanic and yet when it's done well in a game it really fits it can still be very good. I'm not a great fan of negotiation games, but I really like Bohnanza.

Clever, fun, strategic.  What more could you want?  This is simply a superbly designed game - no extraneous rubbish added - its a trading game with a fun and engaging theme.  I would baulk at playing with 5 or more, if you want a good game workout.  With this many, the decisions seem too obvious - its actually TOO easy to manage your hand.  With less people there are less types of beans being farmed and more decisions to make in managing your hand of cards.  That said, playing with 6 or 7 people is still fun and there are not many turn-based games which have effectively zero downtime with 6 people!  Bohnanza also has a problem it shares with Carcassonne - you can actually play this in a 'nasty' way, but its a family gateway game so nastiness is not really the thing to do, even though if its best for your chances.

Not so fun with two players.  I can only stand to go through the deck once.  I enjoy the set collection and negotiation.  The forced order of the hand adds complexity, but almost makes it too difficult to predict future needs.  But without this the game would be boring.

RATING: 8
Winning this game is largely random, but that's just fine - I've had a lot of fun playing it, as has everybody I've introduced to it. The theme is a stroke of genius, for how it lends itself to humorous commentary and for how it makes people skeptical at first only to quickly be converted.

Don't take it too seriously.
Don't play with fewer than 5 players.
Don't buy the Fan Edition, which appears to have been produced by people who want new players to hate Bohnanza.

11-Mar-08: I've now tried out the 2-player Bean duel a handful of times. As expected it's a whole different animal. What I didn't expect is that it is a decent game in its own right, something I'd rate on a par with the likes of Lost Cities.

This trading game has a lot of fun interaction to offer, especially about the beans! We didn't realize that orchestrating trades with more than one player was outlawed in the rulebook, but the game is so much better with it. When you play Bohnanza, play with the rule that you can trade stuff you get more than once. It has a cute and fun theme and interesting mechanics. If it got over about fifteen minutes quicker it would improve my opinion of the game.

Very fun card-based game that is great for groups of 4 or more.  The game incorporates strategy and deal-making between players.  The interactions are the most fun and engaging.  People wheel-and-deal, trying to plant the best and most profitable bean crops.  There are only a limited number of each type of bean and rarity is reflected in the value of a crop.  This is a game that everyone should have in their collection.  Playing time varies, but usually takes about 40 minutes (varies based on how long people debate and argue over deals!).  I love this game.

Good trading game with some interesting mechanics.  Feels a little long for a filler, but still nice for a change of pace.  I feel like luck probably plays a part and shuffling can be hard.  (Which is problematic, because groups of beans are created and it can lead to statistically unlikely clumps in a bad shuffle).

Can drag due to trading/counter-trading in a 7 player game

Based on 20+ plays.  While fun, Bohnanza just isn't all that exciting to play.  However, to its credit, the game can accomodate a wide range of players and the rules are relatively simple.  While it's not my favorite game by any stretch, it is the first choice of a lot of my (non-gamer) friends.

I also own High Bohn Plus.

The game was fun but sometimes when 2 people go for the same beans it gets a bit frustrating. Also 3rd beanfield seems a bit expensive but more plays can prove me wrong. I liked the game. This has a good concept that is built upon a fun mechanic without any distractions.

RATING: 2
Played once in a three-player game and it was agony. The rule that says you cannot rearrange your own cards really bugged me. Made me feel like my hands were tied the whole game. The rule that forces you to play the first card in your hand made gameplay seem too mechanical. My turn: I'm forced to play this card that happens to be at the front of my hand. Does anyone want to pay me for this random card I did not work to create, but just drew off the top of the deck? No? Okay, I'm uprooting my field with it, then. Your turn. And repeat. Where are the choices? There is NO sense of self-determination in Bohnanza. And three times through the giant deck seems like twice too many. It lengthens the game for no reason.

If you disliked Bohnanza, you might like [thing=54043][/thing]. Now there's a trading game that's [i]actually fun[/i].

My daughter thinks Red Bean's picture looks like he has to pee.  Oh and she declared a house rule that you lose if you ever play a Stink Bean.

Bohnanza is an interesting game, although the games I've played so far haven't been too challenging.  Perhaps it was the groups I played with, but I generally was able to keep a steady flow of cards to my fields, so each turn felt more or less like taking care of some housecleaning and letting the system play itself.  I'd like to try it with some more advanced players and trade options, like futures.

Good mechanics, and a good deal on non-gamer appeal.  Hate playing with people who play too nice -- accepting trades that are advantageous to their opponent but don't do them any good. Some say it's a karma thing, and what goes around comes around. But thems that say that don't win, so I don't buy into the argument. Otherwise, fun cards, fun game, good length, nice mechanics. There's a reason there have been so many subsequent bean games.

I feel a bit cheeky to rate it after only one play but really, it is a fantastic game mechanic, very easy to pick up and highly involving to play, with lots of interaction between players in the trading phase. Strategy is deeper than you might think, given it is a card game with a lot of luck depending on the draw order.

I imagine people who are good at counting cards can nail this one.

Good, light card game. Both the static card order and the trade mechanisms are pretty unique and creative. Much better with more rather than less people, because the trading is what makes the game!  I've played the two-player variant several times as well, which is still fun but tends to be a lot more random since the trading element of the game is essentially removed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a winner in many ways. Unique mechanics that force you to trade to win - big plus. Most euros that involve trading either don't encourage trading, or do only to a point beyond which trading becomes a liability. Here, you need to trade often and throughout the game in order to win.

Best with 5 players. Decent with four players, but a fifth added in makes it shine. Six players is still fun but tends to be a little bit chaotic, and the sixth player may get shafted on number of turns. Seven is too many - the sixth and seventh players will almost certainly have fewer turns than the other players, and will struggle to keep up. Three is a marginal playing experience. Don't bother with two.

My favorite trading game! Bohnanza is a gateway card game, with a "forced planting" mechanic that adds a sense of urgency to harvesting your fields. Unlike a lot of gateway games, this one is built around player interaction. It's light-hearted and friendly enough to play with non-gamers, and easy enough for kids to enjoy. This one kicked Chinatown right off my shelf. I have the expansion for this, but have never played it because, for me, Bohnanza is perfect just as it is.

A game with many interesting situations and enough strategy to be worthwhile to play multiple times. The trading part of the game is well done, in some case, you even want to give away some of the cards you got!

So pleasant to play, when everyone is moving quickly enough, warning don't play with more than the recommended amount of players. This is a gem, does work better with more players, but maybe it just makes it more fun, idk.
I didn't like how every time we played this we had too many players and people were slow. This is very cutthroat though and leads up to a great end scoring. I wish others were as cutthroat as I am when I play. I like to add the third bean fields to the deck to make them trade fodder.

Bohnanza (and most of the variants for it) rank among my favorite games.  It can be played in a chatty social environment or in one of hard negotiation so it is good for any crowd including non-gamers.  I have never left a game feeling like I wanted my time back or that the game mechanics have disappointed me which says a lot.

an okay game the value of a been can get over exaggerated even when none of those beans are in play.   I did find the hand mechanic to be interesting but in some instances it could be limiting to point of being detrimental to a player.

A very intuitive set collection game predicated on trading beans of all things! Easy to teach and plays quick. Uwe is one of my favorite board game designers, and while the theme of this game is something that is similar to other games of his, agriculture being a main sub-theme always, I think there is enough substance to this game without having to make it overly complex like some other people might find Agricola, OeL, or Le Havre. One I plan to pick up and play again. Solid 7. Nothing more.

Very fun card game that plays well with both smaller and  larger groups. The inability to change card order is the big unique element that takes constant reminders for newer players but is also the basis for trades during the course of the game. Keeping track of sales throughout the game could help with late game plant decisions, but is not necessary to still be competitive. Have a few of the many expansions, but have not played them much.

Card game with a few twists. Set collection with a diminishing available set when beans are converted to cash. Some "forced" trading due to an unusual hand management: fixed order of the cards as you draw them. **** Not my kind of game: I suck at the trading and manipulation of (negotiation with) the other players.

[size=12][b]Why I like Bohnanza:[/b][/size]

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Bohnanza:[/b][/size]
/ I am neutral to the theme. I nonetheless hate the art for the game, which is fixable via a P&P version of the game. 

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Bohnanza:[/b][/size]
- I was not a fan of having to maintain card order as this limits the depth of the game. 
- The game is best at an odd player count - 5 players
- The game drags on for what feels like a filler game
- There are too little decisions to make. The best choice is often obvious.

Bohnanza is a very good game. The one thing that makes it less than the perfect game is actually the artwork, which, while I think is perfect, unfortunately does turn some people off. The trading mechanism is offset by two small rules that make the game tricky (the inability to re-order one's hand and the minor restrictions on harvesting). But this is sufficient to make this game awesome!

Finally managed to play Bohnanza.
It is a strange game and the trading might lead to kingmaking.
I also had one turn more than the other players. Not sure I had any benefit since I didn't manage to trade in the first round. But the person who lost the tiebreaker against me thinks otherwise.
Anyway I am not a fan of tiebreakers.
I do however like how certain bohns become more rare, since they are money.
The draw deck is thinner and the game picks up space.
I rate it a six since there are quicker card games that offer more or the same amount of fun in that timeframe.
And i prefer boardgames

Cool, light game, all about negotiation and full of interaction. It's easy to play, easy to teach and learn. There's no downtime since the main part of every player's turn is trading, which involves everyone. 
With proper people the game can be very entertaining and its depth grows with smarter opponents. 
It plays smoothly and there's no set-up so it's easy to bring out and play even if you only have an hour.
The theme is just funny and easy for anyone to understand.
It's a lot of nice features for a super cheap game that is small enough to fit in a pocket.

Bohnanza is kind of the "warm up" game at our house so it hits the table a lot more often than likely necessary.  It's a fun little game and a good one to get the juices flowing before the first cup of coffee takes hold but doesn't exactly require superior intellect to enjoy.  I'd call it a six for me as I'll play it when I'm in the right mood but it's definitely not a "must hit the table" game.

Always light. Always fun. It scales from 3-6 brilliantly. Almost everyone I've introduced to the game wants to play again.

How could you ever known, that the bean farming is so great! Bohnanza is a fantastic game with a lot of noise: everyone wants the make deal with the player whos turn it is. Interesting game-mechanic offers quite a lot tactical maneuvers. Two player game is just a shadow compared to the 3 to 7 players game. The bean cards layout is beautiful. Only bad thing is that I've played this game too much (~50 games).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.

As card games go, this one is quite revolutionary. Perhaps its oddest feature is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them. The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them. To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making.

RATING: 8
I like this game a lot! The bean theme is very funny. This is partly due to comical drawings of different kinds of beans. 

The cards must be kept in order you draw them and the card you draw first must be played first. Because of that you'll often need the card you don't have (or want to get rid of one), and one way to get it is negotiating with other players. That causes a lot of laughter around the table. The more people play, more negotiation possibilities arise and that leads to more funny situations and more laughter.
 
But what ruins this game for sure are AP-prone players.

Cute trading game with an interesting fixed hand order arrangement that makes it sometimes necessary to offer trades just to clear one's own hand of useless cards.  The theme is a little bizarre and I think the game would be easier to introduce to nongamers if the "humorous" artwork were abandoned but it still works very well for what it is. Runs a bit long for what it is if people keeping insisting on hyper-optimizing their trades every turn.

2-7 players.  Finally played for the first time after ringing in 2008.  7-player game, which made buying a third field pretty useless.  Jay:15, Gerry:13, Craig:12, me:11.  Don't remember anybody else's score.  Good times, but I think the sweet spot for this one is probably less players than the max.

The theme and art are goofy, but that sets up some really good jokes throughout.  Who can pass up the charm of saying "I'll give you wax for stink?"

What I don't like about the game is that you need at least 6 players for it to really shine.  With less there are just too many beans in the deck for trading to be necessary -- you get a lot of people doing their own thing and just trying to give beans away.  Maybe it'd work better if you pulled even more beans out of the deck.  I'll have to try that.

The two-player version is an admirable attempt at creating something playable, but it's not fun for me.

When you don't have anything to sell, you just wait for the other players to finish haggling about peanuts (well, beans): this is boring.  When you don't have anything to exchange, it is hard to think about any possible strategy: that's why waiting for other players can be boring.

However, I only played twice: maybe I would enjoy the game better if I understood its dynamics and possible strategies better.

Fun trading game. This is usually a hit with people who like more traditional card games (poker, euchre, etc.). One problem I have with this game is players can gang up on one player and not trade with them at all, which usually makes that player very unhappy. Games are usually quite close at the end and a couple rounds can be played in one evening.

After seeing this game hyped up for so long It took surprisingly long to figure it out.  The rules are weirdly convoluted, and I feel the rulebook could be better structured.  It didn't help that it was new to all of us, but even after the first shaky play I liked it.  And now after one where everyone gets it, I really like it.  Its the nice-persons trading game.  You're encouraged to make trades and not hold back or try to goad people into giving away more than they should.  Real fun.

I tried it 2-player, won't do that again.

I still can't find a fitting comment for Bohnanza. It's so dependent on the right group that it dazzles me sometimes. The game itself it's great but the interaction of the players its so closely attached that the 8 is because of the game mechanics. I keep in the level of Cosmic Encounter when it comes to player interaction, but the negotiations become so fierce that sometimes it becomes overwhelming or somewhat chaotic. The chaos is not limited in the game (like in Cosmic Encounter where the balance lies within the interaction of players) so the game goes sometimes unbalanced if the last negotiation becomes beneficial to one player (for example if someone is trying to get an specific card in their last turn and then he/she just trades most of his/her hand to another player). I dunno if we're playing something wrong, but the game seems somewhat "forgiving" if that's the right term...

Edit: We WERE playing the game wrong. We skipped this rule: you can't get rid of a plantation of only 1 card. Also we planted the cards whenever we wanted so it became a lot more forgiving (it WAS the appropriate term). We played it a few times with the correct rules and it became cutthroat and amazing. The rating doesn't go up because I'm still not sure why I don't like some aspects of the game... maybe it's too "balanced" for me. Even when the interaction of players is the most important game, the game always is tightly balanced by numbers and "hidden statistics". Also I've been playing so much that it may affect the rating...

I didn't like the 2-player variant very much. With more than 2, the game is good but can drag if you have players that try excessively to maximize their trades by attempting multi-level trades (3-way trades, etc.).

Opps. It looks like 3-way trades were illegal. Good show designers!

[GAMEID=11] was a game that we were itching for since it looked like a lot of fun with a large group of people (and it certainly looked better than most of the typical party games).  And it worked---we've had a blast bringing this out at several dinner parties.  There's nothing like trying to wheel and deal and get your beans into play.  Since the negotiation aspect is forced onto you since you can't rearrange your cards, everybody gets into it and no one feels left out.  It also appeals to the card counters, since by watching the deck you can get a better grasp on the real values of the beans being dealt.  We've had lots of fun with this game with many different groups of people.

So it was with a little apprehension that we tried the two player game.  How could this even work?  Turns out, the two player rules included in the Rio Grande version work surprisingly well and really keep the flavor of the multiplayer game.  You draw and plant cards like normal.  There's really not much direct trading, but you do have to leave cards for the other player at the end of your turn.  Your opponent can pick up the cards that you've turned in, so it the tension comes from the risk of hurting yourself by keeping cards or helping out your opponent by giving them away.  

In practice, it has that [GAMEID=50] feel---a lightly strategic card game that's easy to play, but still has a decent amount of meat to it.  There's a similar feeling of [i]what cards can I risk leaving for my opponent?[/i]  Since it's ultra-portable, we usually take it with us on trips home to play with friends and family, but it's also a good game to break out while you're stressed out in the airport.  If you have the game, it's worth trying out the two player game at least once.

A must in every collection.  Wonderful interaction for a hugely social game which is accessible for every level of gamer.  The do-not-shuffle rule is inspired and this little touch plus a few other clever ideas pushes the game into classic status.  It is maybe tiresome to stress the details, when it is the big gestures that often grab peoples attention, but the designer could of made obvious simpler choices and had an average workable set collection game.  However, the extra detail in the right places at the right times make it essential and sets it apart.

A nice lighter strategic game. The forced planting/trading and fixed hand elements are cool, and it earns bonus points because it's so accessible. The theming and art are a big help in preventing what could otherwise be a simplistic and bone dry Euro card game from becoming very stale very quickly.

The major flaw is that the gameplay doesn't really develop as a game progresses. Plant, trade, sell is pretty much it, but it's a fun trip.

I would love to rate this higher. I think this is a great party game with straightforward mechanics. What makes it different is that players are forced to plant the beans drawn. This in turn causes everyone to furiously trade, beg or even give away their beans for free to anyone who wants it. Of course, you need the right crowd in the mood for such a party game. AP doesn't work here, leave your thinking at the door or you will drag this game down. I would love to one day play this with many more players!

One of my first games, and will probably always be a favorite. A breeze to learn and teach, and it fosters interaction among players nicely. I love it when a valuable card turns up and inspires a heatedly vocal auction, and I love the subtle alliances and creative favors that tend to be exchanged (sometimes we bend the rules to allow trading for "favors" and other abstracts that make the game pretty funny). We played with a couple of 12-ish-year-old kids recently and it went over very well.

Bohnanza is a classic trading and hand management game from the golden age of German game design. As you would expect from that description, the systems are clean and elegant, player interaction – in the form of the aforementioned trading – is ample, and there is more fun to be had than you would expect from the rules and the quirky bean farming theme.

The ingenious bit is that Bohnanza is a hand management game in which you must play cards in the order you drew them. This simple rule, which has almost never been reused, drives negotiations because trading away cards you can't use will almost always benefit you more than keeping cards away from other players who need them. The cards you flip up randomly each turn (which you must plant if you cannot trade them away) may be the primary spur to action when you are taking your turn, but getting problematic cards out of the way gets the other players to meet you halfway. Without that incentive they would always choose to let you twist in the wind.

Parenthetically, I am grateful to Joe Gola (gola on BGG) for blogging his preference for playing with the German deck instead of the Rio Grande deck, which incorporates the first German expansion. The German deck is smaller, which keeps the game from overstaying it welcome and makes it more likely two or more players will be trying for the same type of bean at the same time. The only downside is that the smaller range of beans makes buying a third field a rather weak play, and false choices are never a good thing. The original Amigo Spiele version is widely available online, although it comes with German rules, of course. If you buy the Rio Grande box, you can revert to the German setup by stripping out the Cocoa, Wax and Coffee Beans. Bohnanza wants to be a 30-45 minute game, not an hour.

Substantially better with 6 people than 3. Feels like the trading component of Catan, without any of the nonsense dice rolling that drags the game out. Everyone seemed to enjoy this, though it maybe outstays its welcome very slightly. 

After the first deck through, it can feel like the game will never end, but the third deck-through tends to go quite fast given people have been removing cards as coins throughout.

I was skeptical because I haven't played a trading game I've liked yet, but something about Bohnanza makes it work. I think unlike Catan and Compounded that you almost always have something someone wants, and in cases are willing to give away things for free in order to not have to uproot other beans might be a factor. Some nice hand management too in that where your cards come  up in your queue matters. It's also nice that it is a strategic rather than party game that plays up to 6 well. The downside to this game is it runs a little long for a filler, especially if people get into heated haggling. I'm also personally not a fan of the art, though the style kind of fits the theme.

Bohnanza is a common classic card game for the average table gamer. Riddled with social and competitive strategy this game seems to satisfy the needs of most personality types and age groups.

Fills the space of an opener, but usually ends up stealing the night with people wanting to play it again.

No.  No, I will not help you.  And yes, while you are taking ten minutes on your turn, I will be chatting about non game-related topics.  Finally, when things don't go your way, no pouting, boys.  

I'm pretty much always up for Bohnanza with the ladies. The artwork is fun.  The game play is very simple.  Yet, it requires forethought, some concentration, and to a certain degree, calculation.

Bohnanza is a simple concept and can be a lot of fun. Due to the timing mechanism games are of a similar length regardless of # players. Sometimes it can outstay its welcome where the hidden scores somehow remove the tension for the win.

I love this game, though my wife recently refuses to play with me, as I am too much of an a** when it comes to trading. Love the mechanics and the interaction of the game.  The not rearranging your hand mechanic took awhile to get used to but now I think it is great.

I never expected to like a game about growing beans so much, but it is really a trading and negotiating game, a genre I love.  Cutting deals makes your bean growing run more smoothly and smoothly means more beans and more profit.  The fixed order of your cards in hand is a brilliant mechanic, if difficult to keep straight for new players, and the dangers of having to plant the wrong kind of bean (throwing off your tempo and thus your earning) should keep the table lively with chatter.  There is some luck of course, as the turn of the beans to trade has a large effect, but a good wheeler-dealer will usually find himself with a nice pile of gold at the end.

RATING: 7.5
Maybe I just haven't played with the right people, but in my experience, this game is almost too friendly.  I find myself constantly making good trades, giving cards away, getting cards I need.  Rarely is there a situation where I'm really competing for a card I want.  And even when there is, and I lose the negotiation, it's often likely that another one of those cards will be coming around soon.  It's okay.  The artwork is cute.  It's not un-fun... just a little slack.

Update 9/1/14 -- Have played a good deal more since last comment; a better game than I first thought.  Play is still pretty leisurely, but there's a pleasantly mercenary quality to it at its best.  And it's a slightly mercenary game that everyone will agree to play.  Nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Games that consist entirely of cards with cute illustrations and numbers on them usually send me running in the opposite direction. Add all the theme you like, & a War or Rummy variation will always still be instantly identifiable as such. But this game is genuinely different - the card order and trading mechanic give it an utterly unique feel and allow for lots of tight, tricky tactical decision-making. This is truly ingenious use of absolutely minimal resources.

An early Uwe Rosenberg design where you are planting and harvesting beans.  The interesting mechanic is that you cannot change the order of your cards and you must plant at least your first card every turn.  This often results in trying to get rid of cards that would force you to harvest.  There is a lot of player interaction and trading.  An excellent family game and a lot of fun.

Good rahter light and quick card game that works well as a filler. It also partly scratches the trading mechanism-itch that I miss since i no longer find the time to play Civ. 
That it also plays well for 5-7 players without lagging make it hit the table ofthen in my gaming group. 
Thera are aslo a good bit of strategy and tactics as well as it demands negotiation skills. Only drawback i find is that it tends to become a bit loud wich favours dominant players by default, but that will be overcome as soon as one gets aware of it.

Flimsy cardstock, but a good light game with plenty of interaction. Works well with a bigger (5-6) group, which is rare.

This is one of my favourite games. So much of the game depends on negotiation, and I love that good play often demands making lopsided trades in order to ensure long-term profitability (something that's much less common in games such as Catan). People who don't like negotiation will hate this, but I love it.

Bohnanza is a fine card game that will force all players to trade, sometimes take bad trades to keep their bean fields a little longer. The game is fun but probably a bit too long for what it is.

Solid card game with fast play and great conversations to take out of context. Play lightheartedly and don't try to haggle trades too much and this will play fast and friendly. If you try to play too competitively this slows down the game and makes this a non-interesting game.  Do your best to leave behind a single Cocoa Bean in the first round, it's always fun to be passing around a useless bean later in the game.

Played two player... first game went down to the "who had the most cards in hand" tiebreaker.  Fun!  However, I suspect my rating would change if I ever get to play it with more than two, as the negotiation aspect would come alive.

UPDATE:  Played with five, and it is a very different game.  It moved quickly, and the trading/negotiation aspect was a hoot.  Increased rating - call it a 7 for 2 players, and a 9 for more.

UPDATE:  Played with seven.  It felt like there was no downtime, as the wheeling and dealing was constant.  Some "tricks" became apparent - trading for future donations, trading same card for same card to get an out of turn plant, etc.  I ran Green and Chili to 4GP's each right out of the gate, and went on to win with 11GP.

First I thought it was just for kids, how wrong was I! The best part of this is doing selling/buying beans with the other players, and it really works well. Eg. in monopoly a player may ask for "100000€" just because he doesn't want to sell something, but here you actually want to get rid of beans sometimes... Not too difficult to learn, but exciting to play. The twoplayer mode is not as good.

I used to like this a lot, but found out one day that I'd always played it wrong: I thought that only the player whose turn it was could make gifts to the other players, not vice versa, and I also thought that he could only add cards from his hands to a deal, not make deals with cards from the hand alone. For me, the open-ended trading in the actual rules (which were eventually noted to me) turned an enjoyable quick trading game into a very long borefest that was more arbitrary to boot. With my house rules, I'd still rate it as a solid 7, without them, it's currently my least favorite game in our collection.
Played 20+ times with the wrong rules and 3 times with the correct ones.

I find Bohnanza to be a good fit with the non-gamer group. The gameplay encourages trade and socialization amongst the players. But for me, I end up sitting in the game often feeling helpless with the options I have available or at the mercy of the luck of the draw.

I enjoy negotiation games as a concept, but they often tend towards chaos.  This one really walks that knife-edge.  It doesn't fall completely into a nasty mess as "I'm the Boss" does, but with so many people there's so much information flying around to really make a decision.  I too often find myself picking whatever option happens to be convenient judge to make the incoherent information stop.  I think Santiago and Bootleggers have more interesting negotiation schemes and a much more controlled setting.

This is my favourite game with new gamers and bigger groups.

Charisma, bargaining and popularity test. Who trades most and best - wins. Know of more exiting card games. Not addictive theme, come one - plants, who cares about plants and seeds? Is it a game for housewives or high school girls last century ? Major loss. Exception: I like to look how the player's personality affect their playstyle, interesting. Exception: friendly play, where nobody cares too much about winning is quite relaxing.

A very clever trading game.  You are by default forced into horrible situations which you must get out of, often by trades that help other players.  Many layers of analysis are possible, but in the end it is just a fun game.  A fantastic game to close the evening -- after a serious brainburner like 1825, el grande, etc., the comparatively gentle Bohnanza is a relief.

Don't mess with bean farmers. Its a cutthroat world in bean farming, but a lucrative one. Be patient enough in cultivating your beans and you will reap the gold; be too greedy and you may be go through your crops faster than locusts, and all at a loss! Bohnanza is a trading game with a hint of strategizing in planning ahead. So dont be fooled by how simple and impersonal bean planting may sound. Players are always on the lookout for a quick buck and a good deal whenever trades hit the table.

Three/Four plays .. could move still. Had fun from the first play though.

Second playing - even better. I think we screwed up a rule the first time .. of course it was a while back. I feel like we didn't force the playing of the next card in your hand each turn.

Anyway.. played with 6 and had a good time. I would say it hangs on a bit too long .. but not 'toooo long'.

If you have Rio Grande Version, take out the Cocoa, Wax, and Coffee Beans unless you want to use the included expansion. I didn't know this was an expansion until just recently.   Taking them out reduces the game length and makes the game way more fun for fewer players; especially for those new to the game. If you have more than 5, use the expansion. Very fun game once you understand the counter-intuitive mechanics.

RATING: 7
I find that the two player variant rules for this game make the game even more enjoyable than playing with 3-4. Rather than the game rely on a lot cross table interaction between players, in the two player variant, players choose from a communal selection of beans, which don't have to be planted if you don't want to, but they become more valuable as they stack up. Turns this game more euro due to the indirect player interaction, but it makes gameplay more enjoyable as far as i'm concerned, and less stressful.

Bohnanza is a set collection game.  In it you are trying to plant various types of beans in your gardens.  By "plant" I mean place cards with different bean drawings out on the table in front of you.

The game was mildly amusing.  The cards were of average quality.  Overall it was pretty forgetful though.  Hence, I have nothing else to say about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is pretty much a pure trading game. If you like a game where your success hinges on how well you can convince other players to make trades, you'll love it.

If you're like me, and you dislike most trading games, you won't. My issue with trading games, be it this or Catan, isn't just the arbitrariness of some of the trades and the impact that can have on the game, but it's the length. All the haggling can cause games like this to drag interminably. This is an extremely light game, and it takes a full hour to play, which to me is too long. Particularly when most of the game is people saying 'a green bean for a chili bean', 'a stink bean for a red bean', 'a wax bean for a soy bean', over and over and over again until you want to scream.

Have played once in a 5 player game, and three times in a two-player game. It is quite a different game in the 2-player version. But the beans are still funny and the play is still interesting. Can't wait to play again in a multiplayer setting.
  Oh, what a disaster! played with 4 people, and it turned out to be pretty confrontational. Not at all as I remember it. I'm guessing some people in the game didn't like being 'forced' to plant when their turn came around. I'll give it a try again though, I still have faith!
Tried it again in a 3-plyr game. Was fun again (although I still lost). Still one of my favs, luv the funny beans!

This is a game that non gamers can get into.  With a little help children younger than the suggested 12 years old can play this game and do well.  My two neices, 9 and 10, and nephew, 11, picked up the game and had a blast playing with three adults.

Finally got to play this with more than two people (3, to be exact.)  It was better than with 2, since trading made sense, but it didn't seem all that much fun.  Maybe we were missing something, but trades didn't seem to have much urgency -- it seemed like making trades should have been more exciting.  Maybe it's better with more than 3.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My friends seem to like this game a lot.  I thought the first couple play-throughs were fun but I don't really like this game mechanically.  While the idea of having your hand work as a queue adds an interesting element to the game, it also goes against every other card game where people naturally sort their hand without thinking about it.  

I also feel that the 3rd bean field is too cheap.  I think it would be better if it started costing 6 and then each field after that would cost one less.  As it stands, the 3rd bean field actually reduces the amount of player interaction as reduces the chance that you will be forced to plant over something you want.

The game is far from bad I guess I just wish there was more to it then just the bean trading.  I would play it again but I doubt it will ever grow on me enough to make it into my collection.

Everybody we have shared this game with has gone out and bought their own copy! Highly interactive, light-hearted, trading/speculating game. Very attractive artwork, and easy to follow rules. My wife and I got my father- and mother-in-law to play this game one night while on vacation. Our folks demanded we play again... and again... and again. We were there for a week and concluded each evening with a game of Bohnanza. It was a LOT of fun for all, and some pretty interesting propositions came up. For instance, my father-in-law offered to babysit our  children for a year in exchange for a cocoa bean! Too bad we didn't have any kids at the time :)

RATING: 8
A great trading game that excels by forcing players to profit through trade as much as possible during their opponents' turns. A good bargainer who can recognize the mutual benefit from a trade usually wins. Getting rid of cards that will hurt you is important, and knowing when and who to donate or trade them to is the name of the game. People who sit back and try to make things happen only during their own turn tend to lose. This is a fun game, and a loud one.

My initial comment was "I've only played this once, and it didn't click with the folks I was playing with.  It needs another play or two before I decide if I like it or not."

Initial rating after 1 play.
Cardgame, fairly simple rules. 
Finally played it. With 3. Was fun enough, but is probably a lot more fun with more. If you're into a lot of dealmaking (like in Santiago) combined with a casual fun attitude (will probably be fun in a pub as well) you'll enjoy this one. Social game.

NL: Kaartspel waarbij je probeert zoveel mogelijk dezelfde bonen te verbouwen, want je hebt maar 2 veldjes. Je bent dus continu aan het ruilen en handelen met je tegenstanders om de juiste bonen te krijgen, anders levert je magere oogst je nooit geld op. Leuk voor een potje in kroegsfeer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun filler game for larger groups of casual gamers.  I don't like playing with just 2 or 3 people as there isn't enough player interaction, and it becomes quite boring.  It also frequently devolves into chaos when played with 6 or 7 people, which just makes it a tedious experience, rather than an entertaining game.  But in general, the gameplay is simple, but solid, and the card trading amongst players makes it a well-rounded game that nearly everyone enjoys.

I have preferred my plays using only the original German edition (garden beans -> blue beans only).  With that number of cards, and 3 or 4 players, it usually lasts a little over half-an-hour.

I think it also works best if trading is kept relaxed and not too competitive, as otherwise the game can drag.

Most of the non-gamers with whom I have played Bohnanza have enjoyed it, and I'm glad to have it in my collection.

Definitely a family favorite.  We get an odd response whenever we bring out "the bean farmer" game, but everyone we've ever played it with has enjoyed it.  Play can go a bit long with 6-7 players, but I love the interaction and humor.  Takes a few rounds to really understand, but still very teachable and friendly to new players, as early decisions don't ruin you for the rest of the game.

This game is great fun for what it is.  It's best when played quickly, in a light-hearted "everybody-is-making-deals-left-and right" format.  It's fun convincing people that you're doing them a favor and that they owe you, when really it's helping you even more.  

I wouldn't want to play too often, or more than once in a row.  But it works great when playing with non-gamers.

This game looks like filler on the first impression, and it can certainly be treated that way, but it has some depth to it, and can be a lot of fun. It's the German board game of the pure card games.

RATING: 7
UPDATE: Acquired the Sissi!-version that I have high hopes for. I'll keep it as a separate entry (under its own name).

A game I've played too much. It holds little interest as the same pattern unfolds each time I play. Probably because of playing in the same group, also, the valuations that players have to make are too similar and if not obvious not that challenging either.

I've purchased the Ladybohn expansion to help offset this, and I intend to play it with that in the future to see if it helps.

However, it is a very enjoyable game, bartering with (or just badgering) your fellow players so you end up the richest bean farmer of all. The moment of insight when people realize you can win without getting your "value" on each and every trade - as long as you manage to make so many more trades than your opponents. The metagame aspect (I trade my partner, friend, wife etc) I guess I could do without, but bah, it's minor at worst. Also, it sometimes goes a bit long, especially with 5 or more but bah.

It has a very nice charm to it, and works with mixed groups of children and adults rather well, the whole haggle and barter bit is something most people can get into - and I play for those devious moments where you can stoneface someone into accepting a poor trade, lest they lose that stack they have the perfect hand for. Also, the game doesn't let anyone fall too far behind, as the leading players will be quick to cut their prices in order to keep their closest opposition from getting a favourable deal.

A good game! Hoping to blow some life into it with the Ladybohn expansion. Haven't come across other player driven / negotiation games at this level of complexity and length (though I know about Chinatown which kinda fits)

Game in a Nutshell: Trade your beans for others beans to plant in your fields. Harvest the fields to get points, the more beans when harvested, the more points.

Played as: 4,6,7,8 player

Pros: Excellent player interaction and themed in a way that some non-gamer could look at it and think 'That looks simple enough, I'll play.' My favorite part is how it's been designed to force trading, and stinginess rarely gets you anywhere. Can work just as well with regular gamers, especially with bigger numbers (5+).

Cons: Typical of trading games, it can drag on and sometimes even turn into bitter feelings. Oh, and that's all this is-- trading / negotiation. Even when the game doesn't drag on un-necessarily, it still feels a little like it over stays its welcome for being such a simple fun game.

Other: People have said this game can vary depending on the group it's being played with and now after playing with a few different groups, I can firmly back that statement. I prefer the game with 6-7 players as cards get dealt out faster and there always seems to be a market for something somewhere.  That creates a faster play since people don't need to constantly try to find something that's just not there for them.

Best Use: A light way to maximize player interaction. More people is better.

Okay game, which forces continuous trading. The trick is to make your opponent think you're willing to help him for something in return, and then screwing him over on a key moment by not allowing him a certain card or forcing him keep a certain card for himself. Much less fun if players do not intend to screw each other.
I do feel I've burnt out on this game a little too quickly though.

This game was an 8.5 for me and honestly maybe it still should be.  I love the game.  The only problem is that it has a little too much kingmaker abilities in it.  I've had several games go down the tubes because people will make deals that are obviously bad for themselves to help out someone who they feel bad for or who is a significant other.  That kind of tanks the enjoyment of the game and has lowered my desire to play it again.  I realize that just means its a group dependent game and that means I shouold play it with other groups but just hacing those experiences made me less likely to try it with people I haven't played with before.  So I guess for me that lowers the rating.,

This is a fun game but its hard to motivate people to play a game about bean farming... (Statement made early on.  Now people love it)

I have to say that I have started playing this more and it is a fun game.  The trading can be a little ruthless at times but overall it is very entertaining.

I had to bump my rating of this one due to the heavy play its seen recently.  The trading is pretty ruthless  and slightly vindictive when played by my group.  (update: the group is starting to dig bean farming :-) )

Pretty interesting card game of hand management, set collection and trading. You are planting beans in your crops, trying to grow them so you can sell them for money, the trick is that the cards in your hand cannot be moved around, so you need to find ways to get rid of bean types you aren't collecting, hopefully by trading with another player who has the types you have. The crux is to know when to sow some goodwill with another player and when to push to get a better deal. Works well with different number of players, but I prefer it with three.

This is the only trading game I've played that I felt has worked well with non-gamers. To do this, a game has to get non-gamers involved AND it has to keep the non-gamers from blowing the game up with bad trades. Non-gamers seem to get valuation in Bohnanza fairly well. It's a fun game even if you don't win. And the theme is quite humorous. The game also earns an extra ratings point from me because I enjoy the 2P variant quite nicely. It's almost like 2 games in one box.

We play it often because it's quick to teach and even new players will often get the hang of it half way through their first game.  The fact that it can be played well with 3-7 players means we'll often suggest it, although we've found 4-5 works best.  There's definitely skill in the game, but it's quite possible for someone to win the first time they play.  A light game that's great value for money.

This is a great beer-and-pretzels game.  If you like games that encourage player interaction, then I'd move this up on your list.  The most fun aspect is the trading phase as people try to help or screw each other into eeking out those few extra coins.  Great for larger groups (5-7).  I recommend buying Yu-Gi-Oh sleeves for the bean cards to protect them from wear and tear especially since you take out certain beans depending on the amount of players.

Ok trading game... mechanics make it so that you are often forced to trade a good bean away for a song, because keeping it would make your position worst. Most of the trades felt "forced", not a lot of strategy or deal-making here.

This is one of my better half and my favorite games to pla with each other. You can play it with 2-7 players, but the 2 player game is very different than the 3+ player game. The main game (3+ player) is based off of trading, planting, and harvesting beans to acquire gold. It's a great social game (as you need to trade with other players to get the beans that you want). The rules aren't too complicated, so it's not hard to teach others.

After app. 50 plays I've changed my mind completely. The game rely a lot on the relations of the gamers. I.e. if you play with for example a couple in love you are almost doomed to lose the game, or at least to get less favourable trades.

It's still a great game though... and great to bring to parties with non-gamers/unexperienced gamers, but I change my rating to 6.8

Különböző fajta babokat ültetünk el a földjeinken, majd pedig ezeket próbáljuk gyarapítani annyira, hogy szüreteléskor a lehető legtöbb babtallért kapjuk az eladásukért cserébe. Nagyon interaktív, a játék szerves része a játékosok közötti folyamatos kereskedés, cserebere.
Az egyik nagy kedvenc. Bárhol, bármikor, bármennyit.

Great game for round the dinner table, after a good meal.
Not too keen on the two player variant, which is a completely different game, but we love this game with any number from 4 to 7. Interesting to find out who your friends are, and who can lie better than you!

* Unconventional, yet addictive card trading game
* Mechanics are deceptively simple, yet planning, strategy and cunning are required
* Can be played very politely or very cutthroat, but both are enjoyable
* Good for the medium filler library, negotiation fans and bean lovers

A decent card game, my enjoyment of it has dropped over the years as I've found new options.  The wrong mix of players risks unbalancing the table due to trades/donations in an unfun way.

RATING: 7
Played once with a group of six.  The game focuses on collecting cards (beans) of the same type by either trading cards in your hand with other players or drawing cards.  The more cards of the same type you collect, the more points you get.  Cards in your hand are in a fixed order, and you are forced to play cards from your hand each turn; thus, strategizing which cards to take, hold, and trade can be complex.  This is also not a trick-taking game, which is nice.

Bohnanza is great. You cannot change the order of cards in your hand and must play the first card. This makes trading essential in this game which is a lot of fun.

A fun game with some interesting and unique gameplay elements. Slightly more complicated for a casual gammer but nothing that can't be cured after a couple of rounds of play. Some player interaction in the form of trading and some strategy as well. People do get turnned off by the fact that you can't organize your hand, which is a little bit of a hurdle for some to grasp but it's a solid and good light-medium weight card game.

RATING: 7.5
Highly social elegant tactical game. You have to be involved in almost every single trading phase. Not for everyone, because of the need to be involved. When people dont try to trade all he time, the game can loose its energy. With the right people: awesomeness in a little box!

RATING: 8
This is an excellent trading game.  I enjoy that the trading is so open.  I have made several trades to get a great card that I and at least one other person wanted by offering to also take the second card which nobody wanted.  I will try to play with the futures house rules the next time I play.

Good card game for a larger group, focusing on barter. The rules for this one are relatively simple, but are somehow always difficult for me to teach. Nevertheless, once you get rolling the serious trading begins. It’s always fun making promises to get what you want… Keeping promises, on the other hand… Well, let’s just say I like having new players who don’t yet know not to trust me.

   This has to be the best proprietary card game I've played.  Most card games, I end up thinking I'd rather play a variant of it with a standard 52 card deck, but this is unique and a lot of fun.
   I do like the Settlers of Catan card game a lot, but it is only two-player and more of an in-depth game.

RATING: 6
Planting and harvesting fields of beans--a very amusing way to pass some time! One of the few games we play where little attention is paid to who might be winning at any given moment. It works better that way I think.

One of the beauties of this design is that, unlike some trading games, it's immediately very clear why trading is essential (to improve the order of the cards in your hand if nothing else), compelling you to actually [i]want[/i] to make trades on a regular basis. The dual function of the cards as both beans and money, which results in a gradually shrinking deck, is ingenious.

We mostly play with three players, which works just fine. Whether to start a 3rd field is always a tough decision. Nicknames for the beans (hippy, smelly, puky, etc.) are a must. Have the Erweiterungs-Set expansion but rarely use it. [41 plays]

RATING: 6
Received in mathtrade 1/12/09.

A fantastic first play - tons of ineraction, and even a little tension!

Edit 4/6/09: What can I say - this game holds up. It's always entertaining, it is easy enough to teach to non-gamers (who universally note they enjoy it and would play it again), it has enough strategy and negotiation that it can be played by serious gamers (in which case it's massively cut-throat), and it finishes quickly. Plus it's portable in a way Dominion or RFTG is not. I would call this the ultimate toolbox game - fit for all types of players and gaming occasions, easily inserted into a space of time after a family dinner, or between heavier gaming with the guys.

Plus, the beans make me laugh.

----------------------

This game almost always gets played in a family or light-gamer enviroment, NOT in a cut-throat environment, and I find it less and less tolerable an experience in that context. I think the magic spot in this game is if you are all playing like mean bastards fighting over every bean and coin. If not, it is just another stupid card game.

I can see why this game is popular, but can't say I'm all that interested. The game plays you 90% of the way, and "skilled" play netted victories of no more than a single point. I can see this being better with more players (We played with three.) and do think there might be a little skill we were mostly ignoring last night, so I'm willing to explore some more. But I won't be the one suggesting it.

Bohnanza should be nowhere near as fun as it is.  It's about beans!  Growing and harvesting beans!  And yes, I know that the beans are just an amusing way of dressing up a set collecting game, but still - beans!

But the mechanics are free-flowing enough that the game is a breeze to play, and it offers surprisingly robust gameplay.  And yes, the literal bean counting is amusing enough to work well with the well-designed mechanics.

Since I read Gola's comments we have only played this 3-5 players with beans up to blue (20) and no cocoa. 

In other words the game as it was first released.
I think this is how it should be marketed and ruled with a 'free' expansion included in the box (coffee, wax and cocoa) which players can add only if they want something different.

A lot of the fun I've had playing this one is the creative deal making that you can create to get the beans you want.

Negotiation games such as this one are not so much fun for people like me who aren't quick, persuasive talkers. For everyone else, it's (apparently) a hoot. 

Everybody's talking at the same time, trying to convince the active player that the deal they're offering is the sweetest. I'm not a fast talker, and I don't like talking over people, so my voice just gets lost in the noise, and my score goes right along with it. This is also why I will never play Chinatown again.

I had a copy of Bohnanza years ago, but I soon realized that I was terrible at it and had never really enjoyed my plays of it. So I gave it away. 

Then I realized that, in our group, Bohnanza is a game that tends to be suggested when we've got like 7 people and we're waiting for an 8th person to arrive before breaking into smaller groups, and we've got 15 minutes to kill. Many of the other games that generally fill that role in our group are games that I absolutely despise, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf. For as bad as I am at negotiation, I'm an order of magnitude worse at social deduction and lying, and so naturally I enjoy those types of games correspondingly less. So much so that games like ONUW make playing Bohnanza feel like heaven. So I reacquired a copy of Bohnanza and now I just keep it around as a less painful alternative for when we've got 15 minutes to kill.

Here is a trading-based family card game that you want to play when you have 5 players.  The "do not reorder the cards in your hand" & "forced plant" mechanisms work surprisingly well to incentivize generous trading. The rules do not feel awkward or uncomfortable. They make players desperate to get crap out of their hands while eagerly hunting the cards needed to complete sets. This game feels simple, deep, silly and elegant; it gets the table laughing, haggling and having fun.

Negotiation games are great and that's what Bohnanza is.  Unlike other negotiations, though, sometimes you are negotiating to get more, whereas other times you are negotiating to get rid of things.  And other players can stick you with a bad draw.

Egyáltalán nem, semmit, akkor sem ha 4 babot adtam volna egyért. Ez bejött nekik, ellehetetlenítették a játékom, utolsó lettem. Ez egy fekete pont, ha akarjuk, valakit kizárhatunk teljesen..

A really innovative card game that is approaching 20 years old and still going strong.

The players are Bean Farmers and need to plant, harvest and trade their way to a gold haul bigger than anyone elses. 

The catch here is that the players must hold their cards in a set order that cannot be altered and beans must be planted in a set order too. But fields are limited and a single field can only hold 1 type of bean at a time. 

So the players must negotiate and trade away unwanted beans to try and develop well established fields in order to earn a good gold total at harvest time. 

This is a great card game and a good social experience in its own right. It was one of the earliest designer games to accommodate up to 7 players but I prefer 3-5 players. 

It also plays with 2 but the rules are modified somewhat to offer a slightly different experience.

This is our preferred party game, gets pulled out a lot with large groups and new friends. Great to take travelling (small and easy to get players). Good duration and often gets a played a couple of times in a row.

Always good for a laugh or two. Very funny watching couples trading in Bohnanza......

Plays well with 2.

Для казуалов — одна из лучших игр Она совершенно не напрягает мозги: здесь нужно только меняться, выпрашивать и раздаривать карты. Ожидания своего хода нет, т.к. выклянчивать и сбывать карты нужно постоянно не только в свой но и во все чужие ходы (к сожалению, не до всех это сразу доходит). Правда, сильно напрягает правило неперемещения карт в руке: трудно следить за игроками постоянно вынимающими карты из середины руки при предложении об обмене (особенно это касается новичков, а ведь как раз для них предназначена эта игра).

I love how this game gets everybody involved. When you are not thinking about what to do you are either negotiating or looking at the other player's tableaus. Zero downtime.

If you get past the fiddly hand managment and the painful planting restriction you will find that this game truly is great.

I can see why this game is considered a classic for some people, but I think the length of the game holds it back considerably. For a game that is just a Rummy variant with some trading and negotiation, this should be a 30-minute game, tops. The 45-minute time on the side of the box is pretty accurate, unfortunately, and I think Bohnanza suffers because of it. If I could get this game played in 20-30 minutes, this would probably stay in my collection, as I haven't played too many games that involve trading that I actually enjoy. There are just too many other better games out there at this point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The best game I have played for 'forcing' player interaction. The need to trade and donate in this game is very well implemented. The cartoon like cards make the whole thing fun, but whilst there is a smidge of luck, there is enough in the negotiation and tactical play to make this a good all round game for casual and hardcore gamers alike. we use this as an introducer a lot.

RATING: 8.5
Bohnanza is a great little trading game. It strikes me as comparable to settlers yet it's even more basic in that it's pretty much pure trading and negotiating to get the best deals possible to score the most points you can. In Settlers there is probably a bit more options and arguably a bit more luck as well as your fate due to the dice is also a factor.

Whether this game will hold up to many many repeat plays is yet to be seen but after limited play I can certainly say this is a game I will like to see on the table more often. I can't say I'm all that excited to try the 2 player variant as I don't really anticipate much excitement with just 2 players but I'll of course reserve my judgment and rating with 2 until we get to try it.

As far as multiplayer though... the game has a nice flow without too much downtime. It's always interesting to see what your opponents get with their 2 upcards and how quickly you can bid to get the card you want while serving the active player up a deal they can't resist. :) 

As they say... you scratch my back... I'll scratch yours. This is never more true than here where it's always beneficial to be in the thick of the trading action as often as you can to try and build up as many good runs of cards as you can even if it means helping others. A bit of social networking is at work here as well. If you appear helpful and generous fairly often by donating reasonably frequently... you will often receive reciprocal help from those you've helped. If you are too stingy and shrewd with your dealings... you will sometimes get screwed over when you can least afford it. That's the rub of a trading/negotiating game such as this.      

This one has room to grow with me yet on the upside and I'd especially like to play this with the full complement of 7 players as I suspect it would be a really fun social event with the right players. As many have said, this type of game is either a big hit or a flop depending on how energetic and vocal your group is. I can see this game being pretty close to dead boring and vice versa this can be almost a riot of fun just depending on which types of personalities dominate your gaming circle.

8.5 rating for now with potential to climb slightly and I'd say Bohnanza has a fairly low chance of dropping under an 8 for me as this type of high interaction, low downtime game is one that's pretty easy to get to the table and is popular with those I play with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Bohnanza is one of my favorite trading games right now and can be played with groups of variable sizes with multiple different strategies.

The great thing about this trading game is that most of the trades that are proposed are mutually beneficial and rarely does one party leave feeling like they got the short end of the stick.  However, that doesn't mean that you can't screw over your opponents if your heart is really set on it.

I would highly recommend adding this game to your collection.

I first tried playing this at the Gaymers meet-up in Burbank, taught by Terry, but he was spread thin, trying to start our group and leaving to help another.  Several of the players got frustrated, not fully understanding the game rules and the rest of us were not confident with what we knew.  So the game disbanded.  Later, Robert was willing to teach it and remain. It was a well received game and we played to the maximum players of 7 I think.  There was a 4 way tie that I was a part of.

Played it tonight with my non gamer extended family. It has been tough to excite them about many games, but Bohnanza went down SO WELL. They were laughing, cutting up, making deals. It seems like it should be a hard game to learn but they picked it up SO easily and were having a great time. I highly highly highly recommend this game. Going to rate it higher now, and look forward to playing it again.

Bohnanza is all about player interaction, and as such you are engaged in every player's turn.  This makes an otherwise fairly simple game much more enjoyable than it might otherwise be.  The prohibition against reordering your hand is a clever and unique mechanic, and the distribution of beans creates good balance and strategy.

It is Bohnanza's greatest strength that is also its weakness.  A group of aggressive, loud players can drown out a quieter, more timid player, and that player will not do as well and probably won't enjoy themselves as much.  Similarly, a stubborn player who refuses to make otherwise good trades can unfairly hurt a few players, depending on how the cards come up.  All in all, Bohnanza is a fun, engaging game that makes a good warm up or cool down game.

RATING: 8
It took me ages to get over the goofiness of the illustrations, but I'm glad I took the plunge. Bohnanza is now one of my all-time favourite card games – mechanically simple, but in a non-constricting way. Variety can be added with a number of expansions that build on the base "economy engine" gameplay in surprising ways.

I'd rate it a nine if Al Cabohne weren't even better.

One of the best party games/ filler/ gateway game available. Lots of fun, great social time too. Card game based on trading different types of beans to earn a payoff. Sure there is luck involved but his highly mitigated by the trading aspect once players know what's going on ;)

Thought it was cool initially, then got a little tired of it and thought it was basic and bland, then liked it a bit more playing some more. Very meh ish game overall, not great at any one thing and not overly bad either.

Negotiation is okay and fun for families I suppose. I like more control and options personally. I traded away after a few months since I just didn't care too much for the game and wasn't clamoring to play it. Maybe this would be better after a lot of time passed but I think there are probably better ways to do a trading/negotiation game (I prefer Catan to this).

[Amigo edition] Small box Amigo edition is much better than huge Rio Grande edition. In Rio Grande edition, they not only add expansion cards (4s, 22s and 24s) but also changed the rules according to the number of players. 

For me, Bohnanza is much much better with just using 6-20 (104 cards) and played by 3-5 players. Then it is a very nice friendly trading game that last about 20-30 minutes. 

I played Bohnanza too many times before BGG, but it is still nice to play it once in a while. Truely, Rosenberg's masterpiece.

RATING: 3
I got tired of begging for beans about halfway through the game. Another game that is a mystery to me regarding its great popularity (also see Trans America). A second playing has confirmed my dislike of this game. I've also come to the realization that a game that relies heavily on negotiation will almost always be one I don't care for. I've avoided sales my entire professional life and I have no desire for it to infiltrate my game playing. I hate trying to convince people to do things and so I'm at a huge disadvantage in these types of games - I prefer to let my brain, not my mouth, do the gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game goes on a bit too long for me.  Also not really big on the lack of decisions to be made.  Mostly a game of remembering what cards people pickup and negotiating to get what you want.

RATING: 5
Far more superior than other card games in the same genre (eg. No Thanks, Fairy Tale, Escalation!, etc.) due to the increased amount of player interaction.

There is a very important rule missing from the English edition:

The active player can offer to trade only 1 card from their hand.

This rule improves gameplay considerably and I would only ever be willing to play the game with it. My rating is also based on playing the game with this rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I can see why they call this a classic game.  It's fun, and there are a surprising amount of decisions to make considering you can't rearrange your hand.  I've played 2 player and with 4, and think both were fun in different ways (the game plays a bit differently with 2 than with more).

A fun game to play with non-gamers. The wrong type of personality - the kind that gets offended if you don't take them up on trades (even shitty trades) - can ruin the experience.

Dropped this from a 7 to a 6. I think that I am slowly learning to hate trading games. Why? Because people trade like crap and that just means that I've wasted a chunk of time where I could have been playing another game. Crappy trading is part (a small part) of what drove me away from Settlers.
I used to love this game, but now I dread playing it in any crowd.  Sad.

Bohnanza is a classic trading game that can be taught easily, accommodates a wide range of players, and keeps everyone involved during the game. We have owned three or four copies, between wearing out decks and giving them away to friends.

The Bohnaparte expansion is an interesting idea, turning the base game into an economic engine that drives your conquest over different types of territory. Not something I recommend for most people as it's more complex, slower to play, more aggressive, and has a relatively high amount of luck in battle resolution.

What a strange game! Bohnanza forces players to fight the habit of sorting the cards in your hand as part of the game's main mechanic.

An excellent trading game, but may be hard for introverts to succeed as trades are self-motivated and not pre-structured for the player.

Although Bohnanza appears to be a just a filler, this "bean game" can take over an hour to play.

Bohnanza is a trading game where you try and plant bean fields of the same type so that you can harvest them for 1-4 coins.  The more rare the bean is in the deck, the less of them you need before they can be harvested for the maximum 4 coins.  I consider Bohnanza a party game because it seems to be good for non-gamers, and the trading aspect of the game really promotes everyone talking.

The game tends to run a bit long and it gets boring for someone that has played it a ton (me), but it still is a go-to game for me when we have non-gamers over that want to sit, drink, and talk around a table.

A great game, I suggest always playing with the per player variants in the back of the rule book, or strip out the expansion cards included in the US version and play that way to keep the game length down a bit.  Bohnanza is basically a framework for forced negotiation.  Love it.

Un gioco comunque godibile.

RATING: 3.5
Lacked the crucial mechanic to get it back on our gaming table time after time. Is it just me, or is the whole point of having a 'hand of cards' in any game the advantage to play them at will, not keep them strictly ordered and close to your chest? It's difficult to see the point in trading when there is no personal benefit.

Best with as many as possible - not great for two, three or even four. Easily ruined by the wrong sort of people, and by 'the wrong sort of people' I probably mean 'me'. Not unhappy to see the back of it.

I have never not had a good time playing "the bean game". It always manages to be fun and memorable. It plays fairly quickly, has light strategy elements and heavy player interaction. It gets everyone involved. Even people who 'hate board games' ask me to play this one often.

It can be difficult to get people interested at first though. "How about we play a game about bean farming!" does not go over all that well. But it teaches quickly and is fun from turn #1, so the naysayers are silenced early on.

Not a filler, not a full game. Theme is unexciting and doesn't fit together with the mechanisms. Still, it's humorous and talkative, which gives it a good amount of credit in my book. With a more fortunate theme-mechanism-implementation, I'd like it much better, though. Gallerists collecting paintings of picture series would suit the mechanisms, for example. Bocklins Isle of the Dead --> rare. Monet's Cathedral of Rouen --> dozens of pictures, not so valuabel?

Finally got to play it. Not that bad after all. Trading  with the kids is sometimes difficult, because they take it somehow personal if you don't want to trade with them. Will be played more.

This game is a gem! At first I thought what's all the fuss; now I understand the simple, clever mechanic and well designed game play! As a 2-player game it is wonderful, but with more players it is amazingly fun! With more players the selling and trading of beans is outstanding! The trading is not cut throat...instead it is wild and unpredictable at times, to every ones benefit it seems! This may become one of my favorite party games! Buy a bean farm, plant more beans in your field, build a 3rd farm to plant even more beans, then sell, sell, sell! So good!

Have played this as both a 2-player and 4-player game and like both.  This is another one that I'd like to add expansions to, if that means anything.  (To me, it means I like it enough to spend more money on it, so there's that.)

Played it first time with seven--it dragged and turned off the non-gaming family members I had been hoping to interest in the game.  Much better with four or five players.  Even six drags some.  We have been playing with going through the deck only two times though.

The two player bean duel is OK too.  It isn't as fun minus the trading, but it's quick and a decent quick filler with my wife.

Overall, the decisions are limited and get old quickly.  Plus it just drags with high numbers.

My wife and I just learned this game in August 2008, when my mom was visiting.  Wife loved it immediately; Mom had trouble catching on.  I was turned off by the stupid bean theme, but I liked the self-scoring aspect (nice change of pace from Lost Cities).

The idea of having not only a hand of cards, but a hand-in-order works brilliantly here. It introduces moments not always present in trading games, where you actively DO NOT WANT specific cards and will really work to get rid of them, but not because they are inherently bad cards. Clever.

RATING: 6.5
A "humour" (or at least silly) themed card game where the designer actually bothered to design a good game to go with it. 

Bohnanza is a clever trading game, I think the rule about not re-arranging your hand is fantastic. 

Better with more players (4 is the minimum I'd want to play it with). I like the theme (farming) but some people may be turned off by the artwork/concept of counting beans.

Bought Spring 2005, Sold Feb 2011 after I got bored with it.

I couldn't believe the same guy who did those miserable farming games also did this fun party game of negotiation. Bohnanza requires constant engagement with your fellow bean-planters and a few stabs at strategy while Agricola/Caverna makes you put the blinders on and worry about developing your own farm, regardless of what anyone else is doing. Any game where everyone is engaged throughout the entire game, I think is a winner. It's what separates just plain good games to fantastic, classic games. Love the game.

I've only played it with the two player variant, but my wife and I loved it.  The mixture of luck, planning, and playing the odds was really engaging.  You really felt like a genius when you held onto your cards for that extra round when it worked out, and crushed when you sold just one round to early.  I'm interested to see what I think of the multiplayer version.

Update - played a multiplayer game, and it was just as fun.  The trading aspect was a nice change from the 2 player game.

RATING: 8
As card games go, this is fairly special. The trades, counter-trades and general whining about not trading with the winner brings the table to life. The key rule is not allowing people to shift cards in their hand, creating a need to trade so you're not forced to harvest your melds before they're big enough to score well.

Surprisingly fun game! Became instantly one of our favourite openers by now, but we can't play it too late in the evening since it is accompanied by a lot of screaming and shouting due to desperate attempts to cut the best deal with the active player! :D

Just bumped this up! Never laughed as much with any other game. Hilarious.

- The rules are somewhat clumsy, but the game is really easy to play, quickly explained and everybody can play this! It's really great fun!

RATING: 7
Good game with a different take for card games (at least, it was for me).  Adds nice variety to a day/night of gaming without too much complexity, but still has interesting choices to make.  A bit of a "card counter" game since tracking what's been played will definitely improve the decisions you make as the game progresses, but with a friendly group that's not a huge issue.

The trading aspects are really where this one lives and breathes, so if that's not a mechanic you like, there's little point in playing.  Smart trading or donations (which are allowed) will make and break your game, and victory is going to go the person that does well here.  A bit of luck with the distribution of the cards, but not so much that you'll be cursing the game regularly.  Plus, the trading helps you offset random bad stuff while taking advantage of random good stuff.

Fun, fast, and with sufficient depth to be interesting without causing headaches.

12/11/10 - After sitting on my shelf for a month, I finally got my friends to play this game. The four of us enjoyed the game but later I discovered we played it wrong. I thought when you donated a card the player had to keep it.

1/15/11 - This game is a blast. I played a six player game with couples. When a significant other wouldn't trade with their spouse.....Woo boy! Look out! I never laughed so hard and I came in dead last. I managed to help another player win on the last play by donating him a card to complete a set. He won by one gold coin. I rated this an 8. Who knew a game about bean farming could be so much fun.

Simply the best light negotiation game out there.  There's really never a dull moment in this game, though the flow of the game can be somewhat group-dependent.  Works very well even with non-gamers, and scales very well up to 7 players.  There are a few niggling rules that are difficult for new players to remember (not reordering your hand, not digging up 1-fields), but as long as you make a note of it during teaching you should be fine.

Not being able to adjust your hand and being forced to plant beans makes this game stand out from all the other negotiation games. You start to make shitty deals because you HAVE to get rid of the beans unless you're going to plant them yourself. I like how you run through the deck 3 times and the deck gets smaller and smaller each time. What looks like a game that would take hours to get through a 3rd time, the deck is a fraction of what it was before. What a great game.

If you hate negotiation, you may still like this game.

Got a 5-player group and looking for a medium-length card game? Bohnanza is a classic, as it can offer a game experience varying from light family-friendly discussions ("[i]Sure, I'll give you a red bean for a soy bean[/i]) to cutthroat negotiations ("[i][b]That's[/b] what you offer for my Garden bean? There are just 6 in the whole game![/i]"). Either way, it's a game that each group should play at least once. Works pretty well to break the ice, too!

One of my oldest favourites. Wonderful negotiation game, in which it is sometimes preferable to give things away for free, or to trade at an unfavourable exchange rate. When played this way, it almost seems like a cooperative game, even though only one person can be the winner -- often the player who was nicest to the others.

Finally convinced the wife to try it, we enjoyed the two-player bean duel.

Played a great 5-player game last night, it was a lot of fun.  This is a great game with a fun/social group

Not so bad as a trade game, although I cannot have fun with it. One of the most overrated games here in my opinion. It's a stupid game, and it is even difficult to explain it to non gamers due to some strange mechanics, it ends that people play without understanding what they're doing.

Can't imagine a better bean-farmer game.
Needs a certain kind of group to have fun with the negotiations.

Otherwise, a bit disappointed to the fact that without negotiations, this is just a simple happyhappyjoyjoy game without true content but with them, the playing time can increase quite a bit. 

3-4 players is the sweet spot, definitely.

We got this game in hopes of our 5-year old being able to play, even though the box says 12+.  Well, with a little coaching and guidance, he got it down pretty well even after the first game.  We played a 3-player game, but I think the more players, the more fun this game would be.  The max is 7 and I can't wait to try it with that many.  You must be nice in this game in order to succeed :)

Fun card game, trying to get melds of different types of beans (11 varieties, different # of cards for each), and clever that you can only plant the bean(s) that are the first card(s) in your hand - there's no rearranging your cards.  This game should appeal to those who love cards.  The rules aren't as complicated as they seem -- just start playing and the rules should be understand pretty well after one game.

Fun yes. Does it really matter how you play? Not much. Somehow all the games I've played (with lots of different people as this is touted as The Portal Game for Non-Gamers) ends with all players being just one or two gold behing the winner. The rule regarding not being allowed to discard single beans from the field is easy for beginners to forget.

Unique and interesting set collection game... with the neat twist that you can't rearrange the cards in your hand.

We have mostly played this game two-player (with the bean duel and the Al Cabohne rules) and found it to be just okay.

I finally had a chance to play it with four, and it's a far superior game with the extra players it was designed to handle. I think this will be a really good game for our non-gaming family.... I'm waiting to test it out on them next.

I really want to get more plays of this.  It's silly and fun, but I think it wouldn't get old easily.

Update:  "the bean game" has finally made the dime list, and I have to say it's a great light game!  The trading is still lots of fun, and the new buildings expansion that we got adds a lot of depth to the choices without increasing the complexity much.  I'm so glad we have been able to play this more lately!

Absolutely love this one! We had lots of 2 players games for a while (I would rate it a 7 or 8 with 2 players), but recently found more people willing to play and had a few games with 5 or more players.

This is a fun filler game.  Firstly, the beans are cute, well drawn, and humorous.  The game play is quick & easy to learn.  Great afternoon filler game and a great game to introduce non-gamers to new card games.  I have played with both with my little niece and my 75yr. old Aunt.  Both liked it a great deal.

It sees the most table time when Jaap's family comes to visit and they are not really gamers.  They do like card games though and were willing to try it.  Luckily, they liked it and it gives us a break from UNO.

I got to play this classic card game finally at my local meetup today.

I was in a 7-player game and the game doesn't play as flexible and strategic as fewer players because the game seemed scripted and almost auto-pilot. It might be worse that the game plays the players but I won't accuse it for that.

I am pretty saturated with card fillers now and this game might score higher if I played it in the beginning of my hobby but now it sits at a solid 6/10.

This game is great on its own and I wouldn't bother with any of the expansions.

Couple of plays: Simple rules but somewhat hard to for people to grasp for some reason.  Planting the beans in the order they are put into your hand is what makes this game interesting.  It forces player to trade and look for trades all the time, which means no down time.  It can drag on a little long for what it is.

Update: Played with a larger crowd and it was much more enjoyable.  I recommend it for 5+.  After you get through the deck once, the next two times through are very quick.

Uwe Rosenberg's famous game of bean-farming.  This is basically a matching-collecting game, where you want to "sow" bean cards in your "fields", matching as many of a kind as possible to score coins.  But the game rules force you to regularly plant new beans, so you can wind up being forced to harvest before you're ready if you're not careful.  Suitable for families with kids, the art of the different kinds of beans is colorful and often quite funny, although some of the jokes require the understanding of a German pun.

Easy to learn and play, but hard to keep friends throughout the whole game.  As a game it is a strong 8 (good for a card game), but as practice for running for office, it would be a 10.  Bean trading where you can't change cards around in your hand... makes for some interesting trades where players have to decide if losing a lot of cards someone else might need is worth keeping themselves from having to play them.  The element of having cards that are good for one person but bad for someone else is quite intriguing.

This game has seen some of the most play time of all my games, which is why I give it such a high rating.  This is because everyone we try it on loves it, and demands more of it.  It's something anyone can understand, and doesn't take a long time.  The comic artwork is fun, and the mechanics are great. The strategy lies not only in what you're dealt, but in how you deal with others. You have to barter and make allies and enemies in order to further your own beany bidding.

I've played this a few times and I'm left wondering why it is highly regarded. I think I can put it down to the fact the game is attitude dependant to make it enjoyable. I found it a little mechanically repetitive, and the trading can be a little long winded. It may benefit from once around trading like Res Publica. But Bohnanza has a bitter pill to swallow: if no one wants to trade for the two middle cards that you don't want to plant, you're forced to reap at a low rate. I guess that is where part of the fun lies for some. I like the frustrating "fixed hand,play from front" rule and the conversion of beans to money mechanic (utilised better in Klunker).

An over-rated card game involving planting bean fields, bean trading, and negotiation. I didn't have a good impression of it after the first play, and repeated play confirmed my initial impression. This is primarily because I don't particularly care for trading/negotiation games. The game, like Settlers of Catan, is very susceptible to meta gaming during card trading. Another negative is the "must keep your cards in the same order" which is somewhat counter intuitive and is far from an elegant core mechanics, but that's what makes this game possible. If you like trading and negotiations, you will probably like this game.

The game is played in two phases. The first phase players roll to accumulate as many brains as possible. In the second phase, players attempt to roll the colors of their opponents in order to deprive them of brains.  It is a game of player elimination that is based solely on die rolls. There are virtually no decisions to make - just roll and roll and roll again. 

Knizia tends to run hot and cold...this game is well below freezing.

Rating has fallen a bit after appx. 20 plays of this. It is a good card game with a very unique mechanic and quite a bit of negotiation/bartering. I will always want to play this with casual gamers and will even use this as a gateway game for brand new gamers. The hand mechanic (not changing the order of the cards and having them cycle through your hand) is unique enough to offer something different to newbies and the bartering keeps everyone involved. Almost everyone I have introduced it to wants to play again right away. Positives: Very unique mechanic for a card game, good gateway game, very social game. Negatives: Not enough meat for my gaming group, falls flat as a filler for heavier gamers (also too long for filler status).

[floatleft][ImageID=41716][/floatleft]Bohnanza is a  great package in a small game. It is pure trading at its finest. Not being able to shuffle cards in your hand is a brilliant idea. 

Don't play this game with M:TG players because they subconsciously shuffle their cards constantly.

This is an amazingly fun little game, where 80% of the game is about your capacity to influence others, and to find creative ways out of a seemingly deadlocks.  It's a game about talking, providing perspective and building trading relationships... at high speed.

However, because it relies so heavily on social interaction around the table, beware of picking the right people to play it with: there's nothing more depressing than a round of bohnanza with players that are not engaging in negotiations.

A very simple game, a deck of cards, a few rules. But it is surprisingly fun to play. There is a lot of negotiation involved.

Primarily a trading game. The restrictive hand management mechanic generates an incentive for trading. Keeping the "active" player involved in the trade keeps the game from being too chaotic. Downtime in minimized since you need to be aware of what is being traded when it not your turn.

The central mechanism or limiting factor for this game is that the players can only play cards from their hands in the order they are dealt, making trades necessary.

If you are a bit more skilled and know what crops are approaching you can do pretty well, however like I eluded to earlier, it's probably best if you play with casual gamers so that you can screw each other over and trade to your hearts content over all the yelling.

The art is sorta cute. As a game, however, it has no redeeming elements.

I would rather eat live scorpions than play this. But the art is sorta cute.

Uwe continues to be my favorite designer. This is a fantastic game that works well with gamers and family. The friendly atmosphere is wonderful. The mechanics work excellently to force players into trades and negotiations that are mutually beneficial. The player who trades the most probably is winning which is just how a negotiation and trading game should be--ie whomever is the best trader/negotiator should win. Overall this is just a fun game that I suspect will get tons of plays with us in 2017.

Negotiation games are tricky when people try to push the envelope of what's allowed... "I'll give you this coffee bean if you agree that some time in the future, you'll do me a favor..."  I appreciate that it can be played as a family group hug game where everyone gets everything they want, or as a cut-throat bean-hoarding experience where you have to pry beans out of everyone's hands.  A good game for 6.

A cute little game with some neat mechanics.

This is one of those games where I cannot understand its appeal.  The core mechanisms are cool and the game seems to work.  It just isn't any fun.

And if you have a lot of players and a few hard core hagglers you're lucky if this game only lasts 45 minutes.

I was wrong.  This is a decent game.  However, I must say, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH PEOPLE YOU THINK MIGHT CHEAT!


Played at a Diplomacy tournament in June of 07.  What a seemingly awful game.  I had much more fun drinking than playing.

REVISED AGAIN: June 2011: [5.5] I think this game is too random.  Is there really that much strategy in this game?  Or is it a fun activity and the winner is just not that meaningful?

Increasing my rating from 6.5 to 8. I rated the game as a 2 player game and that's completely unfair. The game never should have claimed to work for 2. That said, if you DO want to play 2 player Bohnanza, Bohnanza: the Duel is out now and it works wonderfully. Highly recommended.

I've played Bohnanza a few more times with mixed groups of gamer/non-gamer friends and it's always a blast. This and Codenames are the two games I find myself pulling out more often than anything else when friends are over and we want to still socialize while playing.

= 2012-10-07 - R:6.5

We're going to give the 2p version a shot and hope it can compete with Battle Line for time at our table.

UPDATE: The Bean Duel is boring. Fortunately, we have tons of excellent two player card games now so we probably won't try to force this one to work any more. Still not giving this one a rating until we've played it 3+ player at least one more time.

RATING: 6
UPDATE: I dropped this down from an 8. This game is really tedious and repetitive. Too long for what it is. It might be because the goals are quite restrictive (you can only work on collecting 2-3 different sets of cards), which makes the trading not so dynamic. Perhaps that lack of sense of accomplisment is a valid criticism (read on).

High marks because my sister's fiance fell in love with this game despite my sister's intentions. Good strategic depth for such a light and codial trading game. Do you wait for more cards, or try to harvest as often as you can? This tension is Carcasonne-like, but it's also my only criticism I have with this game: There is no grand sense of accomplishment; after you've harvested your beans, you then start your next field; repeat until the cards run out. However, this game has trading while Carcassone has all that wasted time spent on tile-matching!

UPDATE: This is a game that I'm very close to despising because [a] everyone loves this game, which means that I play it too often!

My ideal "party game".  Bought solely because of BGG. I can pull it out to play with guests of most types, its easy to teach/learn, accomodates many players, and it has a ton of player interaction.   That said, it's not what I'd call a traditional party game...one that is mass-produced and merchandised and often not all that fun.  But if I need a game I think will appeal to most "normal" people, this would be it for me (as opposed to say, "Riddle of the Ring"...anyone up for a game of Riddle of the Ring?

RATING: 5.5
Interesting mechanics, with hand-order and overwhelming trading element, but in general, it seems a bit chaotic and unsatisfying both strategically and entertainment-wise. The theme (cute beans) shocks me that otherwise-hardcore gamers will play this game so frequently. The theme seems to force it into a family game, in which case it is way too complicated in turn-order and bean field management for kids to play the proper game.  Now, if those limitations were eased up, I'd think it would be good for kids. Of course, then it shouldn't be as well regarded as it is, since it would strictly be a kid's game, and those notoriously do not get good rankings on BGG.  This game is kind of an anomaly when compared to other kids-themed games on the 'Geek - makes me wonder what clique of people raised this up as something more and then had everyone follow that lead.
---------
According to a few posts here, removing both the Coffee beans (24), Wax beans (22)Cocoa beans (4), and brings the deck back down to the original German version's 104 cards, and makes for a significantly shorter (20-30 minute) and arguably more appropriate, satisfying filler-like game as intended by the designer.

Perhaps it was because the game was played rather loosely with the rules, but this didn't seem like a game of competition to me, more like everyone trying to help everyone else get the best score. Now, I don't mind cooperative games, like Shadows Over Camelot, or whatever, but not when it's an accidental result of a design flaw. I'd like to try this again with people who actually try to win, sometime, and see whether there's a game here or not. SECOND PLAY: with six people all trying to WIN the game, this is a MUCH better game, so I raised the rating from 5 to 7. (It's still not particularly exciting, but it's decent.)

Never thought I could have more fun with beans than when I ate three cans of them on a bet.  Well I was wrong, eating that many beans was not fun, nor did I actually "win" in the end, and this abstract trading game was WAY more fun than any of that nonsense.  It felt a little bit like overcomplicated Go Fish when the rules were being read, but once you get in the game, it really takes off.

Bohnanza is a pretty enjoyable trading game that turns the unexciting premise of bean trading into quite a frenetic affair. From experience, this game needs more players to be fun, or it loses a bit of its sparkle (4 and above at least).

This was pleasant chaotic fun. It seemed a bit long with the going through the deck 3 times. It also seems like it could benefit from some form of scaling mechanism during the games set up. 

The trading and push your luck of the game was really fun. It had a feel to the resistance in one aspect regarding the importance of the gift of gab to get what you want and convince people to go your way. 

It was also a bit more luck based than I would have liked. You can easily do poorly or well based purely on luck. 
~9/13/12 (1 play)

This is a very decent classic. It can go long but that is because any trading game can stall a bit.

My gateway game.

A fun game for 5 or 6 players with little downtime. Initially I rated the game as high as '9' but that has evidently slipped...mainly due to the game's length. Our last game took about two hours which was way too long. Still, its been popular with non-gamers that we have introduced it to and its easy enough to reduce the length of the game.

Very interesting little card game. This was made in 1995? Must be one of Uwe's first games. From the man who is famous for Agricola, Le Havre and At the Gates of Loyang I am totally unsurprised by the quality of this game. Look forward to more plays.

This has really held up to repeated plays. It isn't a terribly complex game, but it is fun and the two player game is actually really engaging, even if it removes the trading elements which makes the 3+ games so interesting.

I ordered this game because I've been enjoying interesting card games a lot lately and this one is quite highly rated.  It seems like quick, light filler, and I tend to enjoy lighter games more than heavier games. 

***Update***

I've owned this for six months and I still haven't played it.  We pulled it out one time for a bean duel, but didn't get any further than sorting out the cards.  I don't really  think I've got much need for a four plus player negotiation card game.  It was cheap though, so I don't feel too bad about picking it up.

RATING: 5.75
Beans, beans, the magical fruit, the more you plant, the more take root.  Until you have to dig up perfectly good green beans to plant an unwanted cocoa bean.  I think I prefer the cutthroat approach where players are constantly at risk of being forced to plant beans they don't want, even if someone else wants the bean.  Only when multiple players want the same beans should true trading take place.  Otherwise, the game is mostly just about randomly drawing cards and distributing them as needed until people end up with similar scores.  I've now played with 5 and 6 players; I think this would be more enjoyable with 3 or 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7

A well-implemented trading game.  There is asymmetrical valuation of goods, combined with some hidden information so deal-making requires shrewdness as well as a bit of calculation.  The pressure of forced planting from your hand drives you to make deals.  Everyone stays involved the whole game, and there is a pleasant rhythm of trading, planting, harvesting. Kids absolutely love this game - rate it a 9 if you are playing with 8 - 12 year olds.

A classic hand-management card game with trading being the major mechanism how to manage your hand. Of course there is  a quite a lot of luck, which cards you draw, but there is also some strategy which beans to grow depending on the beans of the other players and which kind of beans have already been harvested (i.e. lesser bean cards in the deck).

Love it!  Everybody in the family calls it the "Bean Game", but its appeal to non-gamers is precisely why it's a valuable addition to any collection.

A fun card negotiation card game.  Plays much easier than the directions read.  Can go much longer than 45 minutes if you have stubborn or intense traders.

People who don't "get" Bohnanza aren't my people. That is, people who go out of their way, step on each others' toes and, abruptly and without warning, say anything and everything and beg. These *are* my people.

People who are relatively quiet and polite and enjoy themselves. These are my people too. Yep, it always works well. I never have to shun someone from my life after a game, despite harsh words and feral grudgesmirks.

There's nothing to it players, just come to the table and talk. It's easy to set expectations for any group, to establish incentives, and no one shies away from a simple deck of cards.

What a great little card game. This has been increasingly one of our favorite card games to play on game night. The game has just the right amount of strategic play, interaction, and slight screwage factor to keep you interested on each card turned over. All players are involved on each turn so it's a big plus. You hand management, trading, and donating cards all makes this one fine game when all players are involved. 

I had this for years before playing, after my 1st rating of an 8, I have bumped this up to a 9 for me.

This is a very nice trading game. The game is easy to understand. In the game you try to grow and sell the best boons. You start with a number of cards where you can not change the order. That makes the game a fun challenge. You try to get the best boons. In the beginning you play cautiously but later you become a driven trader. It is a very fun game to play and definitely recommended

rating after 1-5 plays = 8

Quite fun and appeals to NGs but seems to be mostly a hand optimisation game rather than the mean and nasty trade game i had hoped for

rating after 10ish plays - 7

it plays well enuff but most trades are mutually optimal and obvious and the luck of the draw is normally decisive

update - rating gone back up to 8 - above reasons arent maybe so true as i thought and also it is good fun

(Roy owns this now too)

Everyone complains about this game as they learn it, then everyone (but one person we've played with) LOVES it. I'm not usually a fan of trading games, but this one is fun. We learned after we'd played it for 2 years that we had one of the rules slightly wrong. So far we haven't changed to play with the correct rules because our way was a bit harder and made folks plan ahead more.

RATING: 6
The game that takes hand management to a new (and different) dimension.  Card order fixed, so one must wheel and deal to optimize the flow of cards.  Works best if people are willing to trade at least some of the time...otherwise can drag on.

Fan Edition - Custom art is clever and cute, but adds another (unnecessary) layer to the game as the icons/photos no longer are as groupable due to the widely diverse styles used on the cards.

Making cheating easy (the "don't re-arrange the cards" rule) is a defect in any game. I inadvertently do this (it's difficult not to if you're used to playing Bridge a lot) every time I play Bohnanza and no one has ever noticed.

I'm not sure what to say about this one.  The cards look great, very high quality (English edition), the game concept seems pretty cool.  I really want to like this one, and I did the first couple times I played it.  But on my third or fourth play, I found myself wondering whether the game was 100% luck or just 90% luck.  I'm not really sure that good gameplay makes a difference.

This game is a fun little card game of collecting sets of different types of beans and harvesting for points. This is different from Uwe Rosenberg's  normal games.  The concept revolves around trading efficiently with other players but if you do not trade you will not win.

Pros: fast, can accommodate up to 7 players, fairly easy to teach and a lot of player interaction.

Cons: not really thematic

I have played this 3 times and been bored or annoyed every single time.  I just can't bring my self to look deep enough into such a abstract mechanic to optimize what I'm 'planting' against what everyone else is planting.  I also do not see this as a good gateway game.  Either people are way to willing to trade or they are so miserly that it screws not only their opponent, but also their own shot at winning.  I'd rate this a 2 but I have a hard time telling my buddies I WONT play something unless it's just broken. Bleh.

Abszolút értem a játék sikerét :) Mindennek az alapja, hogy rengeteg interakció van benne. Tényleg, kb., mintha a piacon lenne az ember, úgy licitálunk néha egymásra a jobbnál jobb babok beszerzéséért, vagy pont azért, hogy az ember túladjon némelyiken.
Nyilván nem szabad véresen komolyan venni. Veszélyes lehet olyan társaságokban, ahol túl erős egyes emberek kapcsolata (pl. csak egymással üzletelnek), vagy éppen ellenkezőleg (nem hajlandóak egymással koketálni).
Csak ajánlani tudom, ha a könnyed szórakozás a cél. A grafika, a babok, az elnevezések mind teli találat!
A játék zsenije persze a kezünkbe kerülő lapok fix sorrendjében rejlik.

A clever trading game with a unique twist: cards must be played from your hand in the order they were drawn. The key is to trade away cards that you don't want to play. It's more fun the more players you have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In most trading games, "hoarding cards" can be reasonable strategy. Not so in Bohnanza! Bohnanza's unique "must plant" mechanic makes planning and trading essential, yet encourages players to help others. If you can get past the non-intuitive yet simple rules, you will enjoy a thoroughly social game!

*****

[q="jkrozel"]Yes, this one works well, once you get past the looks on their faces when you tell them it's a game about bean farming...[/q]

I think I used the following to describe the theme of the game...

"You're a small-time farmer who's big WalMart supplier could care less about your needs and gives you whatever beans they have in stock at the time. You, however, love beans and can't bear to just throw them away. But these beans are sprouting so you, or at least someone, must plant them in the order they came to you. Of course, once you've planted the beans, you're free to rip them out whenever you want."

An OKish negotiation game. The light theme means that people can sometimes get a little shirty if you negotiate as hard as you can - but surely that's the whole point? Fairly feel-badish as you have to repeatedly discard lots of beans for no value. Kind of slow because of the everyone-negotiating-with-current-player phases over and over.

Very simple trading that belies a lot of complexity, particularly as beans' values shift as they are sold and become unavailable. Players must constantly reassess the value of their plots, as the unchangeable order of their hand can force plans to change quickly - this also requires savvy trading in order to clear out unwanted beans.

Plus, beans!

I am terrible at this game, but I love seeing other people negotiate for some reason, so I thoroughly enjoy it. It's difficult to get in the habit of NOT arranging the cards in your hand, but once you get past that, I kind of love having the order of cards in your hand actually matter.

Uwe Rosenberg első igazán sikeres tervezése, még mielőtt sérvet okozó nehézségű dobozokat állított elő agrokultúra és barlangberendezés témákban!

Az egyszerű kártyapakliban kb. féltucat különböző babfajta található, eltérő számban. Ezeket gyűjtik szettekbe a játékosok úgy, hogy a kezükből lejátszák, vagy egymás között cserélgetik. Mindenki csak két féle babot termeszthet egy időben, ráadásul minden körben ki kell játszani valamit a kezünkből, így gondosan kell előre tervezni. Ha ez még nem lenne elég, a kézben tartott és felhúzott lapok sorrendje kötött, nem lehet rakosgatni őket - így egy-egy gyengébb, a portfólióba nem illő lapot addig kell "eladni" amíg a kezünkön előre nem ér!

Kiváló dizájn, amit az is jelez, hogy közepes odafigyeléssel igen szoros játékokat lehet kihozni, annak ellenére, hogy a szerencse elég komoly faktor. Mivel "csak" egy pakli kártya, igen olcsó, bármilyen táskában elfér, plusz könnyen tanulható... igazi családi és utazós telitalálat!

This game is amazing. I love the trading in this game. The trading in this game really brings out the personality of everyone playing the game. For example some players are tight and refuse to make trades unless it really benefits them. Other players help other players out on condition that they recieve help back in future turns. For me this game is the best card game ever made. The art on the cards is also really funny.

There's different beans, which come in different numbers in the deck and score along different progressions. The trick is you can only have two types going at a time, so you have to wheel and deal to get the beans you don't want out of the way. Very clever, simple design. It's fun but not incredibly deep.

My favourite gateway game, and chock full of juicy game theory. Still not sick of it even after 30-ish plays. I'm tinkering with the expansions in High Bohn Plus at the moment, and they look promising.

The core of this game is churning through n[E(x)-1] > E(x) for n players while hoping everyone else slept through high school algebra.

RATING: 6
This is simple game is all about trading with other players to optimise the kinds of beans you can plant for the greater return. Negotiation is the key part of this game. Winning will be dependent on whether other people want to negotiate with you, but in the end, it's everyone's loss. This is a good gateway game for young kids, but otherwise offers no further flavour for seasoned players.

Mehhhh! If you're going to spend this much time playing a card game you might as well play a better one than this. It's an interesting system, but after a few plays the shine has worn off.

-----------------

Update 2014: For me this is very dependant upon the group. I'm enjoying this one better with a group that plays more for fun than taking the winning seriously. Previous plays have always been a more processional and dull affair. Now I discover that more open and fun trading with plenty of talking it up makes for a significantly better game. Surprise, surprise.

People use to talk very good about this game.  Anyhow, it didn't grab my attention from reading the rules, the reviews and the different comments here on BGG.  Nevertheless, I tried a friend's copy and, against my negative expectations, it turned out to be a nice little negotiation game full of interaction.  Players are farmers that grow beans in two or three different fields.  They have to play cards in order of appearance.  The only way to modify this is to exchange cards with the other players.  The one to do the best transactions will be the winner.

I completely get why people fawn over this game.  There are some very interesting ideas here with how the negotiating is handled.

I've only played this two player, and my girlfriend hated it (which made it hard for me to like it). I didn't really like the 3rd bean field mechanic, as it seemed an imperative for every game. Without it, the game is a series of "lesser evil" choices. I enjoyed the variation of bean types. I have a feeling playing this game with more players (particularly players who like the game) might lead my to change my rating upwards.

A full on trading game where trade offers are made constantly. Shrewd trading with some luck from the draw is required for victory. The luck factor is not as large as some may estimate as trading is always possible as one man's poison is another man's meat. Gets better as it gets faster with repeated plays as the non-sorting of your hand is a weird mechanism that is foreign to everyone even though it is uncomplicated.

Game seemed too long for its weight until we realized our four-player group was using the seven-player expansion included in the Rio Grande year 2000 edition.  

Tying hand management to trading is a brilliant way to ensure an interactive game.  Yes, you can manage your hand by harvesting fields early to make room for more lucrative crops (or for crops in which you are long-suited, as well), but trading not only accelerates hand management and enables more profitable fields, it makes for a more interactive, fun game.

I really enjoyed this game.  The math  (or more properly the probability) involved in the game was very interesting - and gives a huge advantage to those that (ab)use it.  I played this game with my wife, brother-in-law, and wife's aunt, all of whom have radically different gaming styles.  Everyone enjoyed it, so much so that we decided to play it again.  In my book that deserves a high grade.

RATING: 8
It is what I thought it would be: an hour of constant dealing and wheeling. The nice thing about it is that at least for now the competitive side is not so obvious. Need to get a grasp on some strategies. 

Finally played again: oh this is fun. Punish people for their stupid offers, ignore them, sow your field just to take something someone else wanted. 

Need to play more with the "right group".

Though I still believe that luck plays a large role, the game's lively social nature (everyone is always involved) makes it a happy time no matter how random the winner might seem to be. The Germans have all the good ideas (options for each player, participation even when it is not your turn, and plenty of table talk. Bravo!

A mi mujer hacia tiempo que no la entusiasmaba tanto un juego.

Edito: A mi ya me canso. El juego esta muy influenciado por el amiguismo... No le bajo la nota, por que con la gente con la que juego, disfruta mucho con el.

Played once with 4P and once with 5P. Despite possessing all the persuasion skills of a mute hamster, Bohnanza is a negotiation game I can actually get behind. At the heart of this set collection game is a brutal rule barring the rearrangement of one's hand of cards, which necessitates the trading out of unwanted cards in exchange for favourable cards. 

Like any negotiation game, Bohnanza is dependent on the group you play with – you ideally need a small group who is open to trades, but won't drag the game through endless bargaining. Interestingly, it is harder to freeze out a leader under these conditions as it tends to collectively hurt the rest of the group. The unavoidable drawback is that it runs a little too long for its own good, even when trades are kept short. While this is a rather severe negative for me, I'd still go for this if I had to choose a negotiation game to play.

RATING: 7
2009: 8. One of the best card games ever!  Lots of fantastic player interaction make this one a real winner across generations, genders and gaming experience. A real hit with everyone I've shared it with, a real gateway game to other stuff.  Highly recommended, although lately I've grown a little bored of it, but playing with more competitive, experienced players usually ups the ante. Deserves a spot in your collection.

Update 2014: 7. Despite my enthusiasm for the game waning a little, this is still an excellent game. I love seeing how people's personalities manifest themselves in the kinds of trades that they make; the free form trading can bring out a lot of creativity. Continues to be a great gateway game.

Growing beans shouldn't be as much fun as this game is.  At its core, Bohnanza is a trading/negotiation game and the rules really promote this aspect well by deterring the active player from being too greedy.  As with most trading games, company matters and I'm lucky to have great company.

This is a great social game because of all of the negotiation required.  I've never had a problem with a new player getting confused about only playing the cards from their hand in order, but I could see that being difficult for some.

While more players is often better, it gets a bit crazy with seven.

When I first discovered this website I was looking for more gateway games to help me get into the hobby. Bohnanza seemed to keep coming up in various threads and geeklists. Now 5 years later I've finally had the chance to play it. It is indeed a simple and interactive game. You can negotiate your way to place of strength, though the luck of the draw will still play a large part in your success.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[1 play]  Not a full game, but plenty for me to get the feel for this.

This is a clever card game. The negotiation element should be considered with regards to who is playing. If they lock up and slow down Settlers, the same thing could happen here.

I like it and will happily play it for some lighter card play.

Most recent play 8-10-08 with Michael, Lyssa, and Meredith at Net Lake.

Kept at Net Lake.

Moderated and played with younger kids (ages 7-13) - it was a hit!

I gave you 4 Coffee Beans last turn - gimme Stink Beans please!'

Clever set-collection and trading game where the twist is that you can never rearrange the cards in your hand. Thus the only way to manipulate cards is through trading with other players. Can you do so to your own advantage without helping your opponents too much? That's the crux of the game.

I like this game a lot. Have only played it a few times, but I like how quickly it gets people wheeling and dealing. The hand management is unique and cool. My biggest qualm is that there are no intuitive rules in this game. The only way to teach it is by playing a practice round, since otherwise it's just memorizing nonsensical steps.

A bit overdone in my circles - ok it's quite overdone and old in my circles, but I can't think of a better introductory game (other than maybe Settlers) that has captured my friends into the world of board/card games.

Really fun to play even if it is a bit of raucous nonsense. I tend to do well at this game which possibly suggest that I simply raise my voice louder, or am somehow more manipulative. The games difficulty is a smidgen above the non-gamers I associate with so it doesn't fit that niche as well as something like Bucket King does, however when the right group and right time slot is found it is a blast.

In the course of five years I've tried to play this game numerous times but for the life of me I cannot make it work. Even though I love trading, negotiation and bidding games, I am unable to muster any enthusiasm for the theme of planting beans. The art is supposed to be cartoonish and fun, but for me it looks like dumb toilet humour. I've played the game with friends, random people and geeks at boardgame camps, yet every time the game is finished my only emotion is "meh...". I've tried enough and I'm done. Even though this is a top 250 game, my copy is going up for sale (I'll be lucky to get a few bucks for it).

Irritating trading game with some nice ideas.  The hand forcing you into a position where you must trade with other players is a wonderful idea, but it all feels strangely chaotic and systematic at the same time.  I've yet to play a game of this where I was with folks that enjoyed this.  For a social game, it is important for at least the majority of players to like what's going on.

Bohnanza still sees some play, though it gets passed over for some lighter fare for newer players, and then doesn't come out much at all with more experienced players.  I like it well enough, but the trading/negotiation aspect of it removes it as a possibility to play with in-laws, and I've played enough of it that I don't bring it out often with new or novice players.

My 8 rating is because it fills an important niche of "medium length, easy to teach, portable, good for large groups, my gamer friends will play it".  I do enjoy playing this game, but put off buying it for a long time because I never considered it essential.

RATING: 6.8
Talk fast, negotiate convincingly and be willing to quickly judge and react for if you do not, deals with be made without you and that will only serve to hinder you in this fun sort-of set collecting negotiation game. Given this, I think this game can actually fall flat with people who aren't willing to talk or negotiate at all, or people who want to take it too structurally/methodically in their negotiation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't like negotiation games, but I do have to make an exception for this one. This is a brilliantly frustrating card game. You're dealt a hand full of different bean cards and you're trying to collect sets of them. You only start out with two fields, meaning you can only start selecting sets of two kinds of beans. The game revolves around that players are not allowed to arrange their hand, the cards have to be played the order they're dealt. This makes it really hard to harvest a large set of the same kind of beans, since your hand is clogged with all kinds of beans. Players have to make deals to get rid of cards not in their favour. Somehow, the way you're basically forced to negotiate works for me. Another great mechanic is that when harvesting beans, cards are turned over and become money. This way the amount of beans gets lower as well, making it harder to get large sets in the future.

A great light-weight trading game. Hard for people to learn at first -- rearranging cards in your hand has become second nature for most of us -- but it's generally fun for everyone. As long as you can get past the odd theming!

RATING: 7
A really unique card game. The fact you can't change the order of the cards in your hand make you strategise and trade what blocks your way to better gameplay and a lot is dependent on how you can best utilize trading vs managing your hand. You don't want to give other players a huge boost, but on the other hand you don't really want to spoil your way to a great bean field. It's a game of balancing all that stuff. For me the relying on trading isn't something I would go for. I am not good at negotiating and I don't really like to play games that depend on it. But still this game is a pearl in its genre. Just not for me.

One of my first Euro purchases ever, from Funagain, of course!  My first couple games fell very flat and I shelved it.  Then my buddy DaveO suggested we play and I had a much better time.  Trading games aren't usually my favorites, but I wouldn't describe Bohnanza as a heavy trading game anyway.  Love the art work!

RATING: 5
This is a well-designed game.  There's a lot of nuance in giving away cards that may help your opponent but also help you while trying to find those deals that help you just enough more that you come ahead in the end.  The art on the cards is goofy and fun and beautiful at that.

It's just not for me.  I like games with a little more meat.

Interesting hand management and set collecting card game. In this game, you cannot reorder the cards in your hand and you have to play them in that order. While it was difficult to not accidentally rearrange my hand, it created a rather unique challenge that I had not seen in another game. I also thought this was game was engaging as it really encouraged you to trade, including giving away cards. My one complaint was it did run a bit long.

This is an incredibly fun social card game with a surprising amount of depth.  Do you help your opponents with the hopes that what you're receiving will also help you at least equally?  Are you going to buy that 3rd field?  What 2 cards will come up on your trade?

Very simple and fairly fast game.

Bohnanza is a fun game, one I never mind playing but usually don't seek out myself. The time this was really popular with my friends I preferred Wizard and Dalmuti a lot.
I like the collecting part, the design of the cards is cute, the mechanism where you cannot change the order of your hand is quite unique; I dislike the hectic part where everyone makes you an offer for your cards. Oh, and it goes on a bit too long. But it is not without appeal, and as most card games it is easy to bring along.

Enjoyable game. Played/playing a few variants of this as well - Al Cabohne, in particular. Play 2 player with trading too, rather than the Bean Dual rules.

An extreme exercise in boredom.  The main problem I have with this game is just how terrible it is with a large group of players.  I got two turns the one and only time I played this with 7 people while everyone else got three.  It's very difficult to do anything worthwhile when you barely have any ability to affect the game.

Suffers from the same problem as Settlers where you can just have a miserable time if the randomness sticks you with resources nobody else wants so they never deign to trade with you.  This isn't always an issue, but it can rear its head in some games.

Perhaps the biggest issue is that it's just so boring.  Draw cards.  If they match, keep and plant them.  If they don't, hope to God someone else wants them.  Rinse and repeat.  Sure, many games can be successful being this simple, but this game is just too dry to be of much fun.

A fun little filler.  I'm generally not big into trading/negotiation games, but this game plays quickly enough that it doesn't turn into too painful a process.  The cartoon artwork on the cards is fun, and the necessity of getting "runs' that was pointed out to me during the rules explanation just added to the atmosphere (particularly in context of the "beans" theme).  It's probably a good thing that the theme is light-hearted because these trading/negotiation games always have the potential to leave a bad taste in some people's mouths!

Very good negotiation/trader filler. It's a set-collection game, but each player can only keep two in-development sets going at once with large sets worth significantly more points. The trick is that you're forced to place several cards on your turn, which very likely means you will have to prematurely score a good set in order to start another one -- unless the unwanted cards can be traded, or even donated, first.

There is effectively no downtime as all players are involved in the negotiations, but it can drag on a bit. I admire the design but can't imagine wanting to play it often -- the luck of the card draws is forgivable in a filler, but the negotiations are so one-dimensional that they rapidly become tiresome.

I can understand why people like this game as much as they do, but it just doesn't do much for me personally.  If you are really into games that involve a lot of negotiation, trading and a bit of strategic hand management, then you will really enjoy this game.  On the other hand, if you are like me, then you apparently won't enjoy it as much.  :)

[3 plays] Initial reaction.  I had a good time playing this game.  I played it 3 player and 4 player.  It was pretty easy to learn and catch onto.  IMO this type of game is better than "party games" for just playing a light game and socializing.  There is some thought and planning you need to do to play it, but really the winner is probably who could negotiate the best trades.  It is a very social game because you have to wheel and deal and make trades.  Playing 4 players was better than playing 3 player.

[RGG 2000 Edition] {Farming; trading, set collection: optimal 6-7p} Bohnanza is a nice family card game. It's involves many player interactions in the trading and donation. It's quite chaotic and the most efficient way to get scores to trade more frequently; players can't win if they refuse to trade due to the special hand management requirement. It seems that Bohnanza has low replayability. The fun washes away quickly after consecutive plays because every game seems to be the same. I will occasionally choose this game for new players, though.

The illustration of the cards is hilarious. The information on the cards is effective. It's an interesting idea to use the card back as a gold token. 

[expansions] The basic set is enough for casual plays. I will not buy its many expansions because I think they only make the game more chaotic without enhancing player interaction nicely. Nonetheless, Rabohnzel (not an expansion) seems to be a funny game.

[player mat] Simon Hunt's player mats are really good.  It helps players to understand the rules easily.  One should print it out and play.

Piantare semi e fare il fattore non è mai stato così divertente! In Semenza, sarete tutti dei coltivatori che piantando semi e raccogliendone i frutti dovrete cercare di ottenere il maggior profitto possibile. Quando venderete, avrete maggior guadagno se riuscirete a vendere un maggior numero di carte dello stesso tipo, ma dovrete piantare solo i semi che avrete in mano, e se non li vorrete, potrete scambiarli o donarli agli altri giocatori. Se agirete con furbizia potrete ottenere i semi che vi serviranno per avere raccolti numerosi, ma dovrete stare attenti a non aiutare troppo i vostri avversari. Al termine del gioco chi avrà ottenuto più denaro, sarà il vincitore. Semenza è un piccolo e semplice gioco di carte, divertente e veloce; adatto a tutta la famiglia, da 2 a 7 giocatori: una vera “semenza di gioco”.

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it. When playing with the kids it's interesting to see them start to make the connection that giving away something that isn't as valuable to them to someone else in exchange for something they want should translate well to further socialization.

It does sometimes seem to take a little longer than I would really like, but overall this has been a great game.

Great game, for some reason crowds of people demand to play this game long after it moves to your "second choice" pile.  Pay close attention to the instructions telling you which cards to get rid of depending on the number of players - and remember to draw 4 at the end of your turns in a 6+ player game - this will make it take 45 minutes rather than an hour or longer.

Fun, end of night filler for a large group. Usually willing to play. 2 player is pretty poor so need a decent sized group to enjoy this one. Worth a punt with a group of non-gamers, but the game doesn't "flow" so well with the different stages of the turn, and some of the rules are clunky and difficult to remember for new players. (how many do I draw? When can I use cards irrespective of order? Do I trade or put these in my hand? etc)

Trading properties was always my favorite part of playing Monopoly as a kid.  This game condenses that trading mechanic down to it's essence.  Trading games only work if all players are willing to trade, and this game forces you to do it.  Sometimes the trades are more beneficial to one player than another, but it's so light and quick it doesn't really matter.  I don't think I've ever won a game but I don't care, I still enjoy myself.
My spouse generally hates trading in games but she will play and enjoys Bohnanza.

RATING: 7
Engaging set-collection/trading card game. The idea is to collect enough cards in a set to be able to sell them for money (victory points). The difficulty lies in that you cannot alter the order of your hand and cards have to be played in the sequence that they were drawn. In order to manoeuvre around this obstacle players have to trade cards with one another in an attempt to add to their sets. The theme of planting beans in fields isn't the most inspiring I've ever encountered but as a trading game 'Bohnanza' works better than most as players have to trade in order to progress and this aspect of the game is controlled more by the cards rather than the personalities/relationships of the players, which is often a failing of this type of game.

Played 5+ times. Bohnanza is a good trading game and a hoot to play.  I enjoy the fast and furious trading and 'donating' of beans.  There's definitely a political element to it as you can give points to people and beneficial (lopsided) trades are often made and you want to convince people that you're not winning so that you can benefit.  The length is good without the expansion.  7 players is probably too much. 2006/09/21

another one of those games they say, "you GOTTA get". so i got it. haven't played it yet though. beans?

Played it, like it, got-a-nice-beat-you-can-dance-to-it. I'm not big on card games but I like Bohnanza. Since there's a lot of trading going on, everyone is involved. You can try to cooperate with others or fight them or both. Not sure which is the best strategy. The artwork is cool and you farm beans. What else can be said? Except that most people I've gotten to play did so against their wishes (the first time). After one game you're hooked.

Fun game! Even the two player variant is interesting. It will take 2 or 3 turns for beginners to understand how it works. Not being permitted to change the order of the cards in your hand is non-intuitive so you have to keep an eye out for that.

Scores are always close. You will think you are doing well and are going to win, only to find that you are the poorest of the group. 

The groups needs to be aggressive in the trade phase or the game will fail. It's the heart of the game. If everybody just try to help everybody else, it loses all of it's luster. It's a game where you have to be selfish and nasty.

On the downside, the game can be a bit long for what it is. And the game is higly dependant on the group.

I have to admit this is one of those games that I was a bit snobby about: "bean farming? Western theme? Really?" With about an hour or so left in the meet up, my interest in learning a new game took over my general reluctance. This is the part where I should probably mention I am an extremely aggressive trick-taking game player. Naturally, I tied for 1st with another very experienced player. Having said that, I can see this game falling flat with the wrong group. There is a LOT of negotiation and dealing going on and with the wrong crowd, it can cause issues.

I finally managed to play this - it takes a little too long for what it is and I'd be interested to see just how luck dependent the card draws make the game, but the basic idea of the game is decent. In summary, not one I'd rush to play again and again, but I certainly didn't hate it.

Edited from an 8 to a 6, with a group that has played the game a good amount, the fun is lost as people in our group have played a lot tighter, and it just plain isn't as fun as it once was.  Still a fun game, but by no means an 8.

An interesting little card game. Very different game play from 3-4 players to 2 player duel. Jury's still out on the fun level of the duel. Not really much strategy to it, and is really more of just a luck of the draw type game at that point.

Short and funny game. It isn't the most strategic game in the world, but it combines some basic strategy, negotiation and luck. I prefer the german setup, which makes the game shorter (except with 6 or more players, that the expansion cards are needed).

Probably my favorite filler with 4-7 people.

És csak akkor élvezetes ha minden játkos hasonló felfogásban játszik.Ketten is élvezhetô!

A game where you must trading. Only for active players. When you only wating for your turn, you won` win and won`t have fun.

The problem with the game is, that it needs a metagame. When everyone only sit and gently propose a trade, than the game is only correct, but without any emotions. Yoy must come in party feeling and propose in a crazy and loud way.

RATING: 8.2
This is one of my games I initially didn't like but now it is one of my favorite game. The first two times I've played it, my opponents were also disappointed, they didn't like the game. But after a while I tried it again and since than  all groups I tried this game with have been fascinated.

This game is a little bit different to the other games I like, but I find it simply amazing. It's a fantastic negotiation game, which is simple and gripping enough to be able to play it with non-gamers or even with tired opponents.

It definitely proved to be worth buying.

Silly old game!  I like it very much, good mix of screwage and social interaction.  Another good gateway game; would be a _great_ gateway game if the rules were more immediately digestible to new gamers (don't rearrange hand, must plant 1, may plant 2, reveal 2, draw 3, &c.).  I'm almost always available for the bean.

I love this game. It is the best negotiation game I've ever played (granted I haven't played too many). But the group of friends I always play this with love it. They want to play it every time we gather to play games. The game is probably getting close to being worn out in my group. But we've probably played it about 20 times and just need a break. But I think this will always be one of my go to social games.

I am baffled about this game, having heard so much praise for it: the mechanics are novel, but I was not engaged. The game seems a little too long and the decisions seem marginal. Each player basically cuts a sliver of bread for themselves and a friend each turn; then at the end, you weigh all the bread to see who got slightly more bread. 

I'm left wondering if I botched a rule, but there are only like five rules.

Also the theme and art are bad.

I liked Bohnanza the one time I played it, but it wasn't interesting enough that I really want to pursue it further. It's somehow simultaneously too light for how long it is, and yet too long for how heavy it is? I'm not quite sure how to say it. The core mechanic is trading, and it does it well, but it suffers from that core weakness of competitive trading games: No one will ever offer you a trade unless it also benefits them, and either you have to gamble on who it will benefit more, or someone involved is an idiot. And I hesitate to call a game strategic when the driving strategy is to trick people into helping you -- that's a bluffing game. And yet Bohnanza tries to be strategic? I don't know. There's also the third option, where you stonewall because you know that the trade can't possibly be as beneficial for you as the other guy; but then the game seems stuck? At least in Bohnanza it is enough to stonewall once; you don't have to keep up the embargo for the rest of the game, just long enough to ruin the other guy's timing.

Great social game. My group tends to play this too nice. Often they'll give beans away without even considering planting it themselves or keeping it for later negotiations. But that's what's fun for them, so that's ok. It's just frustrating when I have a bean someone else wants, but they're out of cards because they've given all their beans away already.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like Bohnanza - it's easy to get people to play because of the cute illustrations, and depending on the group you're playing it with you can play in a light manner (trading cards sometimes for "favors" to be redeemed later in the game - one group of mine even created levels from "small favor" to "favor" to "big favor" and beyond, and used them almost like commodities) to a cutthroat game where sometimes the active player has to [i]pay[/i] people to take beans he does not want, in order to avoid digging up a field.  Fun.

Updated January 2010 - Reduced from an 8 to a 7.  Not a big change, but the ratings are to an extent based on how much one wants to play a given game, and while I do still play Bohnanza, when I see it on the shelf it does not call to me like it once did.

This one didn't do it for me at first.  

It was neglected on my shelf for the longest time.  Rediscovering Bohnanza was a great treat, because I liked it a lot better the second time around.  

I think the difference was in who I was playing with.  My first Bohnanza experiences were with my inlaws, who play games very kindly and with a certain amount of co-operation.  They try to ensure that everyone is enjoying themselves.  
The rediscovery happened with a much more cut-throat group, which makes the game infinitely more fun!

4/27/14 - Got to play this one on the Girlfriend's birthday with her daughter and father (who I feel we're slowly bringing to the gaming side) He said he really liked this one with all the trading.  I can tell he gets the whole concept of wheeling and dealing so he can get certain cards to get the right amount to get the coins he wants.  I lost this game, and while I blame everyone for instantly just drawing and than blurting out "Hey I got one for you and these other two you would like" - Her Father quickly pointed out in a witty manner, that for the same reasons, is the reason I lost.  I couldn't apply burn medication fast enough for that one.

Still lots of fun.

A classic game that we've owned for years, and used to play extensively many years back, but which now only sees the table occasionally. Bizarrely we've only just discovered that we've been playing it wrong all these years. Our "house rules" meant that all the power was with the seller, as he was not forced to plant the two face-up cards he draws. Now we've started playing it according to the real rules that gives the game a whole new dynamic. I think I prefer the proper version better, though our version made for a pretty enjoyable variant, especially considering that we "invented" it entirely by accident.

A worthwhile game to buy, because it creates lots of interaction at the table, which imho cannot be easily replaced by online play. Enjoyed the grudges and time-limited offers that bring laughs to the table. This is a game where it is more fun to mess with the others and gang up against the leader than it is to win. It is however a little difficult to teach to the impatient, as there are lots of rules, especially the one where you cannot rearrange your cards. A 4-5 player game could take hours if the players are first-timers.

One of the best games ever. You can play it til you're sick of it, then come back in a month or so and it's great fun again. If you can get over the (little bit) tricky rules, it's also one of the best to "hook" new players into gaming. A very social game.

This game is popular the first few times played, but can really drag with more than 5 players as some people just have to try to push their unwanted cards on other people. If played quickly, the game is more than tolerable. Most people love the names of the different beans (of course, the stink bean is the most popular), so the trading can be pretty amusing to those listening in.

I have played this three times. The first time the negotiations involved were so wide open and free that it paradoxically felt like a solitaire game. The subsequent times had enough edge to the dealmaking that made a successful swap feel more of a triumph. Still, while I recognize the cleverness of the game mechanic, the lightness of the game just doesn't add enough weight to negotiations to give me the "kick" I am looking for in a game of haggling. In short, it's hard to haggle over something you don't care that much about.

One of my oldest favorites.

The strict rule of not reordering the cards in your hand adds spice. This produces a wonderful negotiation game, as it is sometimes preferable to give things away for free, or to trade at an unfavorable exchange rate. This makes it seem cooperative, but only one person can be the winner.

This is the best game about bean farming ever made. Feels slightly longer than it needs to be, and "don't rearrange your hand" always throws people for a loop, but it's a much better "gateway game" than Ticket to Ride in my opinion.

RATING: 4
This game just doesn't do it for me. I've only played with 2 or 3 players so perhaps it's much better suited to larger numbers. The 2 player bean duel rules seem broken with the "resurrection" of previously discarded sets possible due to the luck of the draw. The game also takes too long to play for what should be a "filler".

I love this game, it is fast and fairly simple, yet entertaining and highly replayable. 
In Bohnanza you start with two spots (fields) and a hand of cards that you have to play in order. You can plant a type of bean (suit) in each field, but once you plant it you are stuck with that kind, and if you want to change crops you need to score the ones you have (the more you have the more points you score), so you stop the progression and restart. It encourages interaction (trade) with other players, to get the cards you are investing in while they get theirs, etc. Also some cards are rarer than others (the rarer give a lot more points). I absolutely recommend it, but it needs at least 3 players to make it good, I would say.

This is an awesome game.  Simple, yet confusing for new people (weirdest turn order actions I've ever seen) but most of my friends really enjoy it.  A must have for any collection, as it plays 2-7 people and kids can easily pick it up!  Plays in about 30-45 mins.

Yes it's silly. Very silly. But if you can't master many of the demands of Bohnanza, you're dead meat as a gamer. 

Can't bid? Can't negotiate? Can't suck people in? Can't Co-operate? Whoa, you're in trouble. 

The Bean Game is an excellent place to learn these skills and a lovely kind place to learn them, if you're new. Until some fucker comes along and decides to score the game. Bastard. 

But it's still a massive bundle of German fun, and I love it.

Most of my plays have been friendly affairs with new players.  I am looking forward to playing this with a group of cutthroat traders - but will that come down to the luck of the draw?  This can be a fun lightweight game with newbies, but can it cross over to something better?

My daughter especially likes playing Bohnanza with the fan edition.  Quite a lot of clever artwork from professionals and fans alike.

I never would have bought this game based on the description. Bean farming? Really? We played at a friend's house. This game was chosen because we had a time constraint and I wanted something I hadn't already played. We loved it. I bought a copy for the family and the 3 of us play regularly (we show cards when our daughter plays and sometimes argue over which of us is taking advantage of her in trades but it's otherwise fun). I've since played this with some non-gamer friends who also loved it. Simple, elegant, accessible and yet there is strategy in watching card counts and lining up your hand to play into available farms. It's not high strategy, but there is enough to make it engaging for me.

I just really love this game. I spend the whole game repeating, "It's all about the beanconomy". If you get excited about trading and coercing your friends then this is the game for you. The main goal is to trade favors, I give you a bean you give me a bean.
The art is not that great, but it grows on you so now I adore it.

Letter Grade: B+.  Accessible, teachable, fun, and great throughout its player range.  Delightful mix of simply-deployed mechanics.  Just ever-so-slightly long, and theme tends to turn off adults if you give them a chance to think about it. 

Always goes over well, once people realize the theme isn't childish, though I find it oddly difficult to teach.  I really love the flow of this game.  It scales extremely well, all the way down to 2.  This has been my go-to gateway cardgame, and as I end up introducing lots of people to games Bohnanza hits the table a lot.  

[05-08-09]: Old rating: 8.5.  New rating: 7.5.  I love Bohnanza but am just now coming out on the other side of a burnout with it.

RATING: 8.5
This is a fun relatively quick trading game.  Figuring out how to get beneficial trades, while not being so tight-fisted as to lose the trades you need to get rid of beans you don't want is an interesting line to try to walk.  If you trade too freely, you lose out on the cards you need to the other people that inevitably also need them.  If you are too stingy, you end up getting flooded with cards you don't want and can't ever build up a decent field.

Decent unique card game that plays differently as number of players change.

The game plays fast, flows well and is quite interactive. The artwork is also nice and the game doesn't outstay its welcome.

The rules are a bit difficult to get to, but after a few plays and a few mistakes they connect. The game plays poorly with more than two players imo, as it becomes an uneasy combination of luck of the draw and kingmaking.

Overall I found this game enjoyable with 2p, but I cannot reccomend it with 3p+.

RATING: 5.5
The family liked this. But I have come to feel that
1. the lack of long-term strategy makes the game a little uninteresting
2. it doesn't seem like you have that much choice in your trades. Usually you can or can't accept a given deal and there's not much room for haggling.

...Maybe what I mean by the latter is that the range of possible transactions is too coarse. When two players have a discussion, they usually just discover whether or not there's one deal they can both take. Not much haggling.

...I need to revisit this game and these comments as I actually dislike a lot of haggling. Rating might improve.

...Well no. Played it again. If you play nice it feels more like an activity than a game, just moving all the cards around to the people that want them. If you play for real it means trying to deviate from the "best" outcome by trying to get something more. But usually others can't accept any other deals, as I wrote originally. So my issue with the game is that it's a game of haggling which doesn't have much room to haggle.

Also, the 3p game seems incredibly loose, with players frequently attaining the maximum payout for a card type.

German edition makes the game more fun, the pictures actually has something to do with the text! (How about that?) It's a classic by now, and it packs light, with simple rules, makes it a good game to bring on holiday. You will always be able to introduce non-gamers to it, and they will enjoy the experience.

If played with the right group, i.e. one that trash talks and is open to lots of negotiations, this is a great game. If not it gets a bit stale. Some of my most fun gaming experiences have been playing this. An hour or more full of laughing.

[Rated 2005/05/06, based on 1 play]

The artworks keeps this light-hearted, even if the negotiation should be cut-throat.  Being forced to play cards in order makes this quite focussed on making the most of what you've got on the turn you get it, rather than strategising too far ahead.

We played this wrong in missing the rule that you can't harvest a field with a single bean in unless that's the *only* thing you can do - I'm interested to see how much difference getting this right makes.  I know I made a couple of 'plant and harvest' sacrifice moves just to get a difficult bean out of the way.

A classic to me. Playable by lots of different types of people (I've played with my younger sister and grandma, as well as my more intense playgroups) and fun in all cases. The atmosphere definitely changes with different sizes and people, and almost always it's a good time to be had by all. The expansions are great for adding more life into the game when you play every day.

A very unique game by Uwe Rosenberg. I have played nothing quite like this game (until Oltre Mare, which has a similar mechanic involved). It has a very light-hearted vibe, and yet great decision making. The best aspect of Bohnanza is the negotiation and trading. It accomplishes this mechanic so well. Everyone ends up having fun through interaction. You find yourself helping other players to help yourself. Better with more players. Completely worth the price.

RATING: 7
This is a weirdly charming card game with some interesting and unique mechanics.  Trade negotiations are the meat of the game, and it is impressive that such a small game is able to implement this mechanic so well.  By far the most unique card game in my collection, and I'd recommend it.  The two-player variant is rubbish though, not worth the time.

The beauty of Bohnanza is just how simple a game it is, but so wildly entertaining, thematic, and strategic as well. There is no person who we have taught it to who has not gone on to sing its praises to their friends, and then their friends... Perfect for groups because it scales well and has an off-the-board trading dynamic, bean farming has never been so fun. From the maker of Agricola comes a less intense, charmer of a game. Another excellent introductory game for newbies.

This is an incredibly clever game that has stood the test of time. It distills trading to its essence - and in this game you must trade to survive! I just love all the backstabbing and armtwisting that goes on.

The only downsides are that the game sometimes feels slightly too long, and that it rewards people who can cardcount. But just go with it and you will have a great time.

RATING: 7
I really like this game, especially for occassions when there are a fair number (5+) of people around who want to play something but are not gamers. There is usually some confusion at first but they end up enjoying themselves. The rule that you cannot change the order of cards in your hand, while important in making this game what it is, is unfortunately a bit tricky for some. Once they get it though, it goes well.

This game is another one that is very dependent on the crowd. With some friends, it is a wheeling-and-dealing game with people trading for futures (e.g., I'll give you this trade now, but I expect you to give be a black-eyed or better when I ask.) 

With another group, most people are trading to help each other out.

In the first instance, the game gets up to a 7 - in the latter instance, it gets down to a 4. So I'll average it at 5.5..

I am really late to the party on this one but I'm so glad I finally picked it up.  I played it once a couple of years ago and didn't really get it.  I find I don't enjoy games as much when they're taught to me by someone else, as was the case with this.  But once I read the rules myself it made a lot more sense to me.  After playing it a couple more times since I love this game.  It's just a joy to play.  The trading and trying to find a way to keep your fields going without having to cash in sooner than you would like is such a blast.

Meh.  Shoot the shit card game.  It's too long for what it is.  The mechanic of "you must play your cards in the order you got them" is pretty smart and seems like it would lead to a solid game, but doesn't lead to much interesting to think about.  Straightforward.  I may trade this one.

Used to have this rated at a '1', but played without any house rules and it's actually got a competitive element.

I'd play again as long as there are no house rules. It helped that we used the German version. It's pretty cool.

Still a little too random for my tastes.

Edit: Up from a 4 to a 6, played again by the rules and it's only getting better.

RATING: 7
An excellent trading and negotiation game with such a silly theme and excellent art that it's even more fun than the mechanics imply. Like many lightweight negotiation games, it's probably best not to take it [i]too[/i] seriously, but there's still enough meat to it to make a gamer happy. While it includes rules from 2-7p, I wouldn't play it with less than 4, as there's just not enough competition for the trades. More is better and rowdier. The game moves quickly and keeps everyone involved all the time, which is a real plus for a game that plays up to 7.

What unfortunately kills this as a real intro game is the sequence of play. Even though the game is very simple at heart, something about the sequencing is very unintuitive for non-gamers. I've taught it to about 10 non-gamers (adults and teenagers) so far - all of them had a very hard time getting comfortable with the flow of the game. Those that stuck with it eventually had a great time, but several gave up after feeling confused and frustrated for 10-15 minutes. Use this one as a fast, light game for semi-gamers, not for a quick after-dinner game to play with non-gaming acquaintances.

Don't let the suggested age range on this game fool you.  My 8 year-old son absolutely LOVES this game and is always asking to play it.  It's a great deal of fun.

You plant bean fields (make melds out of matching cards for you card players out there).  The twist is that you HAVE to play the first card in your hand at the beginning of your turn.  During your turn you get a couple more cards that you have to PLAY unless you can donate them to other players.  Additionally, the order of your hand is very important so you might want to donate cards to other players to get to the cards that will help you.

It's fun and has just enough depth to keep you interested.

RATING: 9
This a popular game with my regular gaming group. It plays up to seven people, and can be played in about an hour so it often gets pulled out at the end of the evening.  I've been playing this game for years, and despite the fact that I don't win consistently, I always have a good time.  Any game that provides this many years of gaming fun is O.K. in my book.

One caveat: Spite can be a non-trivial factor in this game.  If that's a problem for you, then maybe Bohnanza isn't going to be your cup of tea.

Negotiate, trade and plant beans, harvest your fields, and make money. Sounds mundane but far from it: the "bean game" is a high interactive and really fun card game. Has a unique mechanic in which players are not allowed to rearrange the cards in their hands, which forces intelligent hand management and promotes trading or other tactical choices. "Gateway" in terms of difficulty level.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love the theme, and at first found it great - very light-hearted, lots of joking and plenty of scope for Blackadder quotes ("Some beans and some beans is four").  But it gets old very quickly, the lack of strategy begins to grate, and very quickly it plays itself as it becomes automatic to trade the drawn beans and then give away any at the front of your hand that you don't want.  These days it generates more yawns than laughs and hardly ever gets a whirl.

RATING: 6
I loved my first try at bean trading, and thought the game (played with 3) was an easy 8. But we didn't have time to finish. 2nd try was a fun and full game with 5, and my rating struggled to hold a 7.5. After a 3rd play, with 6 this drops to 6. And I can see it dropping more with a few more plays. Some complaints: the more people you add, the more downtime and chaos. With three rounds at 6 (even 5) it really drags. There is also a monotony to the trade rhythm as well and sadly I think this is a criticism that will hold true at the more reasonable 3 or 4 player size games. "Build, trade, rip up feilds, build." Lather, rinse, repeat. The tension and excitement I felt in the first play I think was greatly heightened by the puzle of trying to get into the headspace of not rearranging cards. Once the novelty of that genuinely novel concept grows old, the game starts to feel a little stale. I'd still play this again with the right (3 or 4 person) crowd. The theme can make for some boisterous times. But in the end, it lasts a little too long and gives a little too little.

One of my favourite games which I can play with family or gamers.  It's a little fiddly in operation - somehow the sequence of the turn is unintuitive, and it's all too easy to haul cards out of the back of your hand at the wrong moment - and I'm surprised I haven't seen a computer implementation of the game as those things would be non-issues.

A must have. It plays with lots of people and is popular with most non-gamers. The trading is fun and people tend to be more generous than in other games. People new to the game are usually quite surprised by how fun it is. The art is very fun. Not the same game with 2 players, however.

Unfortunately, I've played it a couple times now with people who are more wheeling and dealing and it's a lot more frustrating and less fun. It's definitely more fun when people are more easy going and carefree.

I love the idea of a heavy-strategy card game, but possibly more than I love the actual game.  These beans are always fun once you get them out and get people acquainted with the rules, but in the end, it always seems like a little too much effort for a little too little pay-off.  Also, luck of the draw plays a pretty heavy hand in this game, which is never my idea of a good match.  If I wanted a luck-based game, I'd play Cootie.

A great trading game but you have to be playing with the right group of people or this game can get torturous.

This game initially rubbed me the wrong way, but the more I've played the more I've grown to like it. I enjoy the trading, negotiation and planning my hand for my turn so I can play at least two cards that I need.

RATING: 9
Several members of my game group believe that this game descended in a pillar of light from on high.  I don't hold that level of regard for it, but it is excellent.  One of my most successful games for nongamers.  The game is just a little too subject to the whims of fate for my tastes, and there's a significant first-player bias, and I definitely prefer other trading games, but when it comes down to it, it's still fresh after 40+ plays.  That is an incredibly high threshold.

Don't bother with the two-player rules, and stay far, far away from the fan edition.  Not only is much of the art extremely amateurish, but some of the illustrations are decidedly racist.  As long as you stick with the standard set, though, this game is a great choice.

Have played two 6 player games of this, and it's just been brutal. What should be a short filler turns into a 90 minute-two hour bore. And that's with calling the game off early, we've yet to get through the deck 3 times as the rules state. It just takes way too long to cumulatively offer up and evaluate a couple dozen offers each turn.

The only thing saving this game from the trade pile is that we can play the 2 player Al Cabohne rules with this deck. My wife and I really like the way the cards can come out of the discard pile in Al Cabohne, and it's a fast hand management game, as opposed to the insufferable negotiating game the "normal" game is. 

Ended up just buying a real Al Cabohne deck, and trading this dog off.

Uwe Rosenberg első igazán sikeres tervezése, még mielőtt sérvet okozó nehézségű dobozokat állított elő agrokultúra és barlangberendezés témákban!

Az egyszerű kártyapakliban kb. féltucat különböző babfajta található, eltérő számban. Ezeket gyűjtik szettekbe a játékosok úgy, hogy a kezükből lejátszák, vagy egymás között cserélgetik. Mindenki csak két féle babot termeszthet egy időben, ráadásul minden körben ki kell játszani valamit a kezünkből, így gondosan kell előre tervezni. Ha ez még nem lenne elég, a kézben tartott és felhúzott lapok sorrendje kötött, nem lehet rakosgatni őket - így egy-egy gyengébb, a portfólióba nem illő lapot addig kell "eladni" amíg a kezünkön előre nem ér!

Kiváló dizájn, amit az is jelez, hogy közepes odafigyeléssel igen szoros játékokat lehet kihozni, annak ellenére, hogy a szerencse elég komoly faktor. Mivel "csak" egy pakli kártya, igen olcsó, bármilyen táskában elfér, plusz könnyen tanulható... igazi családi és utazós telitalálat!

I like the negotiation aspect of the game, and how it ties in with the way that you may never reorder your hand.  There's a certain tactical strategy in knowing when to trade to reorder the cards in your hand, and when to hang on to what you have, but it's a unique mechanism that draws in a lot of non-gamers.  It's certainly a revolutionary design.

I really like this one, but it is definitely one that requires the right crowd. Also, I have apparently ruined this one for a couple of groups of friends who were already familiar with the game.  For some reason, everyone seems to forget that a bean field with two or fewer beans can't be harvested if your second field has more than two beans.

The art is great, and the game is decent. An issue I have with it is that the best way you can get an edge in this game is to memorize the cards that have already come out. I hate memorization as a general rule, so this is a definite strike against it. I also find the bargaining ("ok, but you owe me!") kind of lame, since it makes me feel sort of slimy to truly play to win. Still, there is something enjoyable about harvesting a massive stack of beans.

Bohnanza reminds me of Carcassonne. On the surface it seems simple and non-confrontational, but a few plays reveal that the game contains quite a bit of meaness. It takes a little while to get accustomed to your hand of cards having a fixed order before they enter play, but this clever mechanic really drives the negotiation aspect of the game. I also like how the scored cards become the game's currency and are effectively taken out of circulation. It really mucks with the set collecting aspect of the game, which in turn keeps everyone on their toes...In short, There is a heck of lot more game here than I ever would have expected!

Negotiation.
Light-medium weight (2, fixed hand/card-order, negotiation).
Medium level player interaction.
Low theme application.

One of the few games that pushes past 6 players, it's good for large groups. The trading and bidding readily generates humour with the right people as they'll escalate the process and inflate value, while others will throw in commentary and try to manipulate the determination of trades. I've found that some introverts can be overwhelmed when extroverts go hard at it (we can be a loud bunch!) so it's probably worth guiding rowdy folks a bit to allow everyone a bit of time to breathe early on.

Easy to learn with a realization of different strategies every time you play. I have only played in smaller groups so the game play for 7 players may be different.  It takes the first few rounds to develop what bean fields are going to be the most productive.  The first rounds consist mainly of you trying to get in hand in order for the rest of the game.

RATING: 6.3
A trading/negotiation game that I'd like to try again with ~5 people and correct rules :)

Players must plant a bean on their turn and then deal with two random beans that come up. With seven people, the deals are quick and chaotic, and trades are almost always 1 for 1. In reality, deals should be more complex, taking into account the frequency of certain cards.

The game seems to depend on the group you play it with. I wouldn't mind trying it again.

My wife's absolute favorite game, so we play this every time she's at the table—and she easily wins more than half the time because she gives away cards left and right, then receives donations in kind later that rack up her score. (I think my record is 3-37.)

A great game for those new to Eurogaming—if someone can lead them through the first round, after which everything becomes much clearer. Don't be too hard-nosed with your deals, or else you'll be cut off and wither on the vine.

I've come back around on this. I really like the constraint of the order of your hand and the urgency to trade that it inspires.  I still think there's a good deal more luck than is immediately apparent. Since points are usually so tightly grouped at the end, all it takes is one little extra run of luck to skew the game. But undeniably original and approachable for just about anyone.

Update (8-11-08):

My last two games of this have really demonstrated the experience disparity that this game can produce.  In the first, everyone was wheeling, dealing, whining, and pontificating.  People were generally accommodating, but also weren't afraid to screw each other over.  The game was an absolute blast.  I would give this game an 8 or 9.

In the second, the game devolved into simply "who needs this? here you go." Cards were frequently given and accepted, with only promises of "future considerations" given in return.  Not one time was somebody forced to plant a bean they didn't want to.  Creative trades were eschewed in favor of you-scratch-my-back-I'll-scratch-yours play.  The game was random and very dull.  I would give this game a 2 or 3 (though others still seemed to like it more).

Which game will show up next game night?

The game is pretty much nothing but a way to make you trade with other people. And it works. A rare example of a game full of positive interaction where trading is good for both of us, and in fact just giving presents to people works well too, even if they don't reciprocate it later.

It's considered a classic and it deserves to be.  Really hard to get going with, especially just using the directions.  Much easier to taught verbally.  Once you get going, it plays quickly and easily.  Lots of good decisions, simple mechanics (a deck of cards!), portable.  And the bean them is just great.  Really adds to the enjoyment.  Hilarious to play around non-gamers; they hear complex arguments/discussion about taking stinky beans and wax beans, and they really don't know what to think.

This is a fantastic game! The rules seem a little complicated until you do a test run. We play this with family (non-gamers) and everyone has a great time. There's quite a bit of strategy for a non-gamer game. It makes a good family game because it encourages helping other players to create a win-win situation. This is definitely one of my favorite games. It'd make a great Christmas present for non-gaming families.

The trading aspect is more, as my BF pointed out, telling people what you want or want to get rid of and then hoping they have a similar situation. It's not true trading in the sense of determining values and making a deal so much as just a simple exchange of cards. That being said, I am okay with that mechanic. I think this game plays well with five or more players, for some reason. I really like the theme, it's cute, and I like the collection aspect of the game (I usually like collecting games, it's the OCD in me). It is very hard to collect enough to make it worth your while so this is a challenging game, despite its simplicity. The fact that you only play from one part of your hand is really cool and that's what makes the game so hard/fun. I like that mechanic. I generally had a lot of fun with this game and would definitely play it again. I wish I had more to say about the game but I can't think of what.

Bohnanza doesn't seem to have anything special from a design standpoint -- simple rules, no elegantly crafted miniatures, no deep strategic or tactical elements.

I know this is popular, and I know that I'm scoring it low, but my rating is highly subjective.  I really don't like trading games, and clearly trading is at the heart of this game.  I don't care for the unstructured bidding, with everyone talking at once.

I can recognize that this is a fun game for people who like trading, and the twist that you can't rearrange the order of cards in your hand is an interesting one.  But it's not for me.

It it obvious this is a late 90s game. The game mechanic is easy with a lot of interactivity between the players. However, I think it was a bit lenghty for the game play (it should have been a filler more then a 60 min game), and I think it was a bit too random. 
If played with the right group of people (people who like to trade), it could be a bit of fun. Needs 4+ players, and its good it can be played with 7 players.

It just doesn't click with me. At times I can't resist the urge to shuffle the cards in my hand which you can't do. The game mechanics are really restrictive and other players can really decide on who will win or lose so a lot of "kingmaking" in this I feel. 

Also a bit too long for it's own good too. Could be just the gaming groups fault, dunno. For some odd reason I do keep winning each game that we play Bohnanza even though I don't like the game.

This is a bean-trading game, and is a lot more fun than it sounds!  This is a light game, great for families, where players try to plant the right type of beans and then collect enough cards of that type to harvest them and get gold.  To get the right beans, a player has to trade whenever they can.

Fun little trading game.  Often feels like you have very little control over what is happening, but not being able to re-arrange cards means advance planning is needed.  I often find myself making trades that seem to be balanced in favour of my opponents just to keep from having to blow up my own fields.

Een spel dat vooral een handelsspel is, met lekker veel interactie.

Spelers gaan bonen verbouwen op hun velden. Verschillende bonen hebben allemaal verschillende waarden. Echter, iedereen heeft maar beperkte ruimte om bonen te planten en dus kan een speler niet al zijn bonen planten. Hij doet er goed aan om mensen te vinden die deze bonen wel graag willen hebben en misschien ook nog wel bonen heeft die jij graag wil hebben.

Deze urgentie wordt vooral verhoogt door het feit dat je verplicht bent altijd je voorste boon te planten, ook al heb je deze boon helemaal niet op je velden liggen.

Mij krijg je eigenlijk altijd wel warm voor dit spel.

This is a great game!  This game introduced me to fun, albeit, expensive hobby of board/card games.  The thing that makes this game work is that it forces you to interact with other players if you have a chance of winning.  Being a game of trades and negotiations, each game is different since group dynamics affect how the game is played out.  But generally, the better under cutter wins.

For me, any game that relies on a significant amount of trading automatically loses its "game" categorization and gets shifted into an "activity" category.  Invariably, someone either likes someone else more than you, isn't hip to how best to negotiate equal value trades, or doesn't pay attention to what others are collecting and ends up handing another player a win.

Yes, I am overly focused on competition and winning.  I know.

Played a few times face-to-face and once on BSW. A classic trading game, which is a genre I am not too fond of. Although it is an interesting mechanism, the way cards are ordered in my hand irritates me. I can understand that some people like this game overall, but I just think it is not for me. And as I expected, playing it on BSW does not help.

A light card game.  At least it's supposed to be.  But if you play to win, you have to count cards and play nastily.  So there is this conflict in feel between the light fluffy appearance and the possibly cut throat behavior necessary to do well.  It's a little jarring.

This doesn't catch on as repeated plays with different people involved a lot of 'stop shuffling your hand' to players which was annoying.  Mechanically it was fine, I just wasn't chuffed to play it after that.

I find this to be a pretty great gateway game.  It is very simple to learn & to teach.  The hardest part is remembering to not sort your cards.  It's got a very lighthearted theme.  It is light, but with lots of player interaction, making it very social.  The best part is that it sounds a little weird and complex.  So when you say "Trust me it's easier than it sounds"  And it turns out to be true, people are more willing to trust you with the next game.

"Light diffraction is making my coin stack look larger than it really is. It's okay to trade with me!"

"Should I buy a third bean field? I dunno, CAN I buy a third bean field?"

"You gifted me a Coffee Bean because it ruins your setup, and I just drew Stink Bean and Wax Bean, both of which I need. PRO SKILL."

"What is that? A Garden Bean? That thing looks crazy! If I take this bean he will murder me while I sleep!"

This got brought out as a "filler" 3-player recently. A lot of fun and light enough to be good when it's late in teh evening and you need a mental rest after things heavy. Only dumping one card suit for 3 players seems to make the game a little long though (3 times through the deck). Would happily play this one any time, and I always like card games for their portability. Update: have played with 4 and 5 now, both of which are more fun than with 3.

It's an addictive, fun, and quite strategic game with 4-5 players. First-timers will need a few rounds to get used to a few singular game mechanics, but a nice introductory trading/negotiation game with limited "screw your neighbor" moments. [UPDATE 2/28/06] Rating dropped from 8 to 6.5. Drags on a bit with more people, and the illusion that mutually beneficial trades are equal is hard to overcome. Also, once you find yourself behind, it can be incredibly difficult to get back into the game as you have to constantly add value to other players to earn points yourself, effectively making null moves or marginal increments on most turns.

I really like trading games and this was no exception.  While I find it kind of hard to explain to new players it gets rolling very quickly once you start playing.  Trying to properly arrange your hand and keep track of the amount of beans left to plant is pleasantly, lightly thinky and the trading tends to be friendlier than in other trading games I've tried. Good fun!

I've even found I enjoy the poorly regarded 2 player version.  Its not like playing regular Bohnanza but its still an enjoyable little filler for me and my wife.

This is a great party game or game if you have 45 minutes or an hour to kill. Kids as young as 6 or 7 catch onto this game. This game really plays well in groups of 4-7 people. You can even stretch it out to play 8.

I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Average card game, with clunky mechanics. Moreover, I'm not a huge fan of games with trading.

RATING: 9
Always love to play Bohnanza (the original set), three or four players, always a great pleasure. Can be played nicely, giving cards to other players and being gentle, or even in a more aggressive mode, blocking the others and negociating harder.
Always want to play.

RATING: 6
Not as fun as I thought it would be.  2-player variant was ok, I liked it enough to give it another shot, but the 3-player experience felt even worse, you can't really screw with your opponent, there was very little risk involved.  Maybe this will change in the 4-7 player game, but I would definitely not want to play this again with less than 4.

At first, I wasn't going to give this as high of a rating as I actually did.  Then I realized the impact this game had upon my parents and how it opened the door for me to introduce other "more meaty" games like Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence, so I give credit where credit is due.

Slightly sub-standard party/family game. Reasonably clever rules and design, but simply not that much fun to me. Between this and the somewhat similar Bang! I would almost always pick the latter.

My family's favorite game.  It is strange, but often the best strategy is to donate cards to other players in order to avoid having to harvest other fields prematurely.

Once upon a time when I took Bohnanza everywhere...those times I didn't have any other game. One of the first games I bought, played and loved. I played in the beach, at the restaurant, christmas, the train or while camping. It is an accesible game, I love the negotiation discussions and jokes around the game. It is easy to teach and fast to finish. Wonderful with 4 players. I don't give it a 10 because there is not really a deep strategy so it becomes a little repetitive when played too much in a row. I mean, there is little variability in each play. What makes it variable are the conversations and the group. It is really boring with mid-hard eurogamers brain-burners.

I'm not one for leaving my gaming success to the generosity of others. Especially when I normally play with relatively new players who don't "know what a good deal is" and get immediately suspect folk who try to influence them. Don't worry, I've learned from my mistakes and keep my cool, but it's still not my sort of game. :)

Very fun.  Making the order of cards in hand matter is a very clever mechanic.

All the trading makes this susceptible to "couples team-up".  Which can suck.

Trading beans...what else is there to say?

It is nice for the fact that there is a "I'll help you by helping me" aspect.

I always feel like I am comfortably in the lead until we count up points, which is when I discover that I have come in dead last...

May be missing pieces

My low rating is probably just from the many errors (in rules and strategy) from the teacher.  The game she taught I'd actually give a 1 or 2, but I can see it's probably a much better game than that if played correctly.  I definitely want to give this another play with a better group.

This games takes the idea of trading and makes it insanely fun with a few interesting and unique mechanics. I is very easy to teach and perfect for groups, as it requires player interaction on every single person's turn.

A game you must play at least once. And don't muck with the rules; they're the rules for a reason.

This is a facinating game that in my family is won by social dynamics more so than strategy. As soon as someone is perceived to be acting in a nasty manner, everyone else isolates them and then they will lose.

Great as a two player game, add the extra .25, Multiplayer (for me) suffers from a lack of cutthroat players.  Perhaps I will find some and  this game's rating will be the 8 I think it deserves.  For now, no...

Got it when Battleline came out with the game(before Avalon Hill bought the rights).  I really liked the fact that ALL the planes in the Western Front were represented with their own performance cards and counters.  Eventually expansion kits like &#039;Dauntless&#039; put planes from the Pacific Theater and the Russian Front on the game board as well.  Just a real collectible because I honestly think EVERY type of aircraft that fought in WW-II is represented when you count all the expansions.

Detailed game of WWII Air-to-Air combat.  The rules were dense and the fast-paced, decision making of Air-to-Air combat was lost in translation; as multiple charts had to be consulted to manuever your plane(s).

I'm not sure if this really captures the feel of dogfighting, but it is a good game.  Sometimes, the aircraft seemed too difficult to control, and I always wanted more variant aircraft to choose from.

A game which gives an interesting insight into the logistics and tactical demands of WWII 'big-wing' raids. But this game fails  to create the apprehension and uncertainty that would also have been an ever-present burden.

I still like this game a lot.  S. Craig Taylor doesn't get the credit he deserves as a designer.  Needs a single rule change to allow planes passing head on to shoot at each other.  Playable and detailed.  See also Wings for a WWI enhanced version of this system.

Battleline (not AH)

Planes in a left bank CAN NOT slip to the right. They go left, period. Change that (and at least get rid of that second free turn) & it's a decent game. Late '70s/early '80s I'd say it was the best WWII air game available. Easy enough I can still get people to play it.

Comments also apply to Dauntless and Wings (Yaquinto - in Wings the offending maneuver is called a "skid,").

Used to play this quite a bit, and own the Dauntless expansion as well.  This was great as a multiplayer game, and good to learn strengths and weaknesses of various planes.  Simultaneous movement was a weakness, and we tried impulse movements but felt it slowed the game down quite a bit.  

Unlike others, I enjoyed the AH edition airplane charts.

Solo ground attack games were fun, and attacking a ship with a lot of A/A was a scary eye-opener.

Though compared to the family of games such as "Over the Reich", "Achtung Spitfire"; "AirSuperiority", "AirStrike" and "The Speed of Heat" have better thought and  well balanced, coherent sets of rules; the AirForce/Dauntless game system is robust and fun to play. It was also the first of this kind of games that I bought and considering the number of hours played with my brother in the eighties, listening to DepecheMode Violator, before the invasion of video games, I think that it is one of my favorite wargame.

Sure there are easier and better looking games today with the same theme but back in '80 this game offered a pure joy of WW2 aerial combat.
It's not fair to compare AF with games that came after +10 years. 
It's a hard simulation of a 3D environment on a 2D map, the counters are the most simple colored counters ever produced and the tables need time to be mastered.
If the first impression isn't a positive click in your mind then just try something else.

I loved this game in the the 80's (or was it 90's?) and we had some great multiplayer dogfights!  I also like the Dauntless Japanese expansion.  The aircraft charts were really nice and it was entertaining just studying the strengths of various aircraft at certain altitudes ect....  Eventually we morphed this game into 1/72 plastic models and fought sprawling battles across the basement floor.  I still have over 70 aircraft models we painted up to play this!  Lots of good memories here.

Used to play Airforce, together with Dauntless, in my late-teens.  Overall reasonably enjoyable but numerous turns of manouvering using written SiMov eventually becomes tedious. More the four fighters per side makes for a long game.

This one will probably never again be played in my home, if only because it is difficult to convince my boys to play Air Force when they could actually feel like they are flying on the computer.

RATING: 4.5
Pretty good in its day.  But the limfac of trying to represent 3-dimensional combat in a 2-dimensional environment, eventually left me thinking-eehh.  The vertical is absolutely critical to air combat-and not giving one an instant assessment of relative positioning-is frankly not a representation of air combat.  I thought that at 17 having just started flying.  Now 30 years later after flying F4s for a lot of years-I know.  Personally I abhor pre-plotted movement, or just about anything that makes me feel like an accountant rather than a player.  Haven't seen JD Webster's offering, but given his background I would assume that would be a good game and sim of WW2 aerial combat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I am not a huge tactical air war fan...but this game had detail and was fun and quite simply is the best of its type I have ever seen.  The type of plane, the mission, your speed, arms, etc...they all make an impact.  One of the VERY few systems that incorporates (naturally) the bank and roll-rate of the aircraft (critical in dogfights unless you want a generic "turn rating").  Great realism for a *playable* WARgame.  BUT, this is a real *wargame* and as such the plotted movement, and details may not be for the "modern anti-record keeping crowd".  Oh well.  I'll like it!  :-)

Un buen juego de aviones, antiguo, pero bueno, lo mas dificil es empollarse las reglas para jugar a un juego demasiado antiguo y complejo cuando existen alternativas que en mi grupo de juego resultan mas atractivas y divertidas.

I played the Battleline version first, then the Avalon Hill edition.  I preferred the Battleline aircraft performance cards as they were easier to read.  Of course, this game has been superceded by J.D. Webster's Fighting Wings series of games.  But for its time, during the seventies and early eighties, Airforce w/Dauntless was the game for WWII air combat.  Especially when a large aerial engagement with twenty or more aircraft to a side were involved.  The rules were simple enough for a player to handle a whole squadron of bombers or even a staffel of Messerscmitts at a time.  I would recommend this series of games for a newbie, but someone with experience with air combat games should consider Whistling Death by J.D. Webster, since his model of aerodynamic performance is more accurate.

The version linked here is from Avalon Hill, but I owned the Battle-line version of this game and of the Dauntless game.  These were fascinating games with their stat cards and plotted movement sheets.  I had lots of fun playing against several opponents.

RATING: N/A
The Avalon Hill version performance charts are very cool!

For a novice at this game coming up with the plotted moves can be headache inducing. I'll stick to the chits of Mustangs, or simple move plots of Check your Six.

I own the Chinese version.  Glad that I did.  I was hooked by wargames unlimited imagination ever since.  Piloting a Me202 or a Spitfire in a duel of death?  That is just a fantastic idea to me as a kid.   Air Force is my all time favourite, if not one in the top 10 'cos I really had a good time when I was young and had a lot of free time to spend on reading the planes' charts, differentiating their capabilities. Guess what, I could really tell what's a Me or Stukas thing different from a Spitfire. And I found it exciting...wow, cool, there is something so wonderful in the world that I can travel with a fighting plane on my command to duel others. The log sheet system actually deal with a 3-D spatial problem with a 2-D surface map, with height recording on the log sheet of all planes. A big plus is the game is EASY to play!

I gor this to supplement my Dauntless game. It was a $15 purchase as part of a set on th Consimworld forums. I've never even opened it. I have no plans to do so in the near future. It makes me wonder why it's still around.

RATING: 6.5
My, weren't we satisfied with weak graphics back in the day?  The utterly uninspired and unispiring graphics get a half point knocked off.

That out of the way, the game sure looks complicated enough to be an air combat simulator.  Each plan has a trippy color "dash board" card that tells you what your airplance can do at any given speed and altitude.  Although it looks indimidating (or hypnotic in the right lighting conditions, , it is not hard to use and game play is relatively quick and easy.  Those cards are the mechanism, by the way, by which the Zero's better turning against the Wildcat will be demonstrated on the map.  Each plane has its movment plotted for simultaneous movement.  In the last game I played my son's Zero peppered my Wildcat once using his superior maneuverability, but once I slowed down to just above stall speed I could turn a bit myself.  For some reason the Zero forgot to use its amazing turning ability and allowed me to line up for a couple of close range shots that just shredded it.

A lot of detail and physics (including some fantasy physics, apparently) are packed into a quick, fun and not-to-hard-to-play game of WWII air combat.  I got the package that included Dauntless, wich was otherwise available  in an expansion pack.  Aside from the graphics, this is a game that has stood the test of time.

Tactical simulation of World War II aerial combat. The amount of data and calculations that need to be juggled each turn sharpens the mind, but requires stamina, especially when you try to simulate large engagements.

Another game I wanted to like for its subject matter, but which turned out to be a disappointment.  The mechanics of movement were poor.  The inability to move effectively in the vertical made it a 2-D game.  Finally, the si-move mechanics of plotted movement made it a game of guesswork rather than tactics.  A poor simulation of dogfighting.

Fantastic in its day, but that was many years ago. Now I think computers handle single-unit tactical combat games much better than boardgames. The AH Smithsonian game Mustangs isn&#039;t as detailed, but is a more realistic option for gamers who value their time these days.

I guess I bought this one around 1983 or 1984 (TAHGC ed.). At that time I already owned a 48K Sinclair ZX Spectrum microcomputer with a "last generation" flight simulator... so I suppose I was lured by the colorful data cards! Anyway, when I tried to demonstrate the loop and roll maneuvers to my younger brother, he got sick! Really! And another cult game fell into oblivion...

Played this a lot back in the day, and the designer is one of the greats, but this game series didn't crack the code of a tactical air war boardgame that's exciting and works. (I actually think it's almost an impossible task -- best attempts have either been absurd or incredibly tedious. This one falls on the tedious end of the scale) The aircraft data cards were cool, but the rest of the game didn't match the cards.

A little dated, but still very playable.  Can take a long time to play if players not kept to task.  A well-run game takes 3 hours.  Good with 4-6 players.  More players than that requires excellent discipline, else the game drags badly.  Consider a house rule for determining who moves first - last.  I have a slight preference for the battline version over the Avalon Hill version, both are fine.

An oldie that has been surpassed by other WWII aviation games.  But we played the snot out of this game in high school (longer ago than I care to remember).  Funny story... my best friend's dad (who was a Buff (B52) pilot at the time) announced one day that he wanted to play but it'd be unfair to us (because he was pilot).  Needless to say, he was shot down in no time flat.  We still laugh about that whenever we get together.  Ah, memories...  :-)

Yes I bet there are better aerial combat games available these days, the plotting of the movements on a log sheet feels a bit dated though personally I like it a lot, and with all the flight sim pc games it shows its age but this game has always been an all time favourite of mine.

The plane cards that look like the instruments of a cockpit are a stroke of genius. The only problem is the damage model, it is a bit anti climatic.

I used to own both the original Battleline version of Air Force and Dauntless, and they were probably my favorite games when I was younger.  I've recently tried to get into some of the more modern (and more complex) tactical air warfare games (like the Flying Wings series) but some of these more modern games just seem a bit too complex and hard for me to fully get into.

For me, both Air Force and Dauntless just seemed to hit the right spot for complexity and ease of play.

Lots and lots of great games in the 80's but like Air Sup it was just a bit too faffy and complicated. My experience was marred when a player I had just defeated (by shooting out his engine block) insisted he could continue to fight and just glide around. Of course the rules assume you have a working engine so doesn't bother with 'routine' power inputs. However, he was adamant about the gliding and somehow managed to shoot me down (think I was pretty badly damaged). Never played again after that one.

I am really a big fan of this ASL in the sky. I have played numerous games, with sometimes eight players around the table, and the feeling of real dogfights have always been there. Even if you see all the planes on the map, I have seen some players so focused on their target,meanwhile they have lost the fact that an enemy plane was on them.
For me Air Force is less realistic than Fighting Wings but easier to play. It has a good balance between realism and play.
And if you own all the extensions, you can create all the scenarios you wish to.

Scores of playings in the good old times. Traded away when the Fighting Wings system appeared. As a simulation, the FW system is much better (except for the non-simultaneous movement). But as a game, AF is better. So I rate both games a 7. It really depends on what you want.

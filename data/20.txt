WOW!  Rating based on one 4-player game (all newbies with wargame experience).  Game plays very quickly -- partly because turns are timed, partly because you can't take back actions, and partly because the rules are streamlined and don't require much consultation (with the player aid downloads from the Geek).  To be honest, we pretty much forgot about mining all that pesky ore since it was so much more fun to smack each other around -- way, WAY more fun.  Piece of advice: guard your speedboats!

Vous représentez une compagnie miniere dans un futur lointain. Le plateau de jeu représente la planete que chaque compagnie veut exploiter. 
L'objectif est donc avant tout de ramasser du minerai. Mais ces ressources sont rares et il peut etre intéressant de se débarrasser de son voisin. Au tour 21 et au tour 25, chaque joueur peut décider ou non de décoller et compte alors ses points.

Lots to like here - great theme, well carried through into the game rules and of course there's lots of lovely wee metal minis to play with too!  The very abstract combat system feels a little out of place with the more random elements but works well and the limited game turns are a good concept (though the random ending can be a bit too chaotic).

Real time strategy in a board game. Combat is a horrible game of attrition and a waste of precious action points so a very unattractive option. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
When this game was new, it was probably the bee's knees. Now it just feels like old hat.

The idea of this game is simple: you have a force of fellows with tanks, crab like things, barges, boat bearing guns, and so forth. They land on a planet covered with valuable ore. You want to collect that ore, which is worth VPs. Said ore can also be turned into additional units, which you will need as there are other folks here with the same goal as you.

The combat system is very simple, if 2 units have another unit in range, they can fire and take it out. There are certainly some timing nuances present, but the idea is easy enough to grok. On the board itself, the terrain can change a bit due to the tides, stranding vehicles at inopportune times. So you get 15 action points and you move around collecting ore and blowing stuff up. 

What this reminds me of is Command & Conquer. The basic premise is very similar, but because this is a table top game, it feels clunky and slow. Sure, you can't erect buildings with your ore, but you can get extra units, and the combat feels strikingly similar to the real-time strategy genre.

I know what you're thinking...slow? But there's a timer! Sure there's a timer, but until you get into some real close competition with the opposition, most of the points are easily burned collecting ore in the back 40 and turns can whisk by in a minute. And while one can feel the time constraints a bit when there are a few timing heavy combat plays to resolve, the timer, for the most part, wasn't getting as much of a workout as I might have hoped.

Overall, I can see why this game is popular with a certain segment of the Geek, but it's just nothing that speaks to me. I wouldn't object strenuously to playing it again, but I wouldn't recommend it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The geek way points me in its direction. This well made minitures wargame has a distinctive and original theme that the game mechanics help demonstrate, but one must be heady with it to see it that way. I've played the PC version only.
One may be forced to "remake" this one, but definately worth it. The scale I'm thinking of reminds me of a short story in the "The Golden Man" (PKD). 
And, unfortunately its not usually a non-BGGs cup of tea.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really, really cool game...the mining/resource gathering theme is great and the action point management is as tense and frustrating as it gets.  It seems like the rules are little quirky for what they are trying to accomplish but by and large they are successful and still innovative nearly 20 years later.  I'm really surprised this system hasn't been nicked for another theme.  Side note- the Mac version of the game is very cool (even if it's OS9) and has a an awesome song in the startup screen where a vocoded voice says "Full Metal Planet!".  Yeah!

Fast. Mean. Brutal. Good. 4 players seem to be much better than 3 or 2! The time pressure and the rule "you can not take back a movement" makes people go crazy. I witnessed how a co-player jumped up and angrily threw over his chair when he realized that he made a mistake and can not fix it.

I like the ever changing terrain, timed turns and action point system.  The battles are just a bit too fluid for my tastes because players have so many APs available.

RATING: 7
Has aged pretty well for an 1988 game. Was innovative at the time no luck combat, action points allowance, changing terrain and a mix of combat and resources management.

Today problems are, 3 hours duration , possible player elimination, eventually king making (not always). Very unforgiving, mistakes are costly and hard to overcome as there are no balancing mechanisms, you have to rely on negotiations if you are in a bad situation however, it is often beneficial to gang up on a weakened player.

Nevertheless this definitely suits the theme of a cutthroat race for mining by any means as much as you can at the expense of your rivals. Immersive but kinda of hardcore gameplay despite simple rules. Worth playing but not necessarily paying 150$ for a second hand copy.

Beautiful and rare game.  Rules are very intriguing, but I still don't feel like I've ever played the game truly correctly (on a limited timer with no take-backs on moves).  I've always meant to scan my board so that I could cut it up to make the 'expansion.'

RATING: 5
Players mine a planet for ore.  The game features heaps of metal miniatures, rather difficult to penetrate rules, timed turns.  It's struck me as rather bloated, and very French (i.e. different).  Of course, it's now hugely collectable and rarer than hen's teeth!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Oh, I love this game.  Slurping up resources, buying some new equipment to help slurp up some more.  You can zap people and even capture them if you want.  

Because of the timer, the allowcation points, and  it keeps the game from falling into zero-sum banality.  Further, the diceless combat system further tightens up the game so that everything is based off of hard decisions, but the timer voids what would otherwise be nightmarish analysis paralysis.

This comes close to the most interesting elements of RTS computer games, but confined into a boardgame format.  Zipping around harvest oar from the planet and then trying to take off in time keeps the tension going till the end of the game.

The drawbacks that you have to see past though are that the rules aren't well written and so you may need to work with them to some degree before playing since the timer is going to get the game rolling and make it awkward to pause everything for clarification.

The timer can also be tough for a lot of people.  You have to have real discipline, much less so with the G8 Timer, to make sure that the game keeps flowing constantly and not stopping for whatever reason.  Because of this you need the right group of people ready to play and ready to concentrate for the games strengths to come out.

The game doesn't look like much up close and there isn't anything special about what's going on, but the whole concept of timed action-point-based turns really gives it that edge.  But apart from the metal, the components are awful so only a 6 for me (and I don't think it is worth the price tag that goes with its rarity - it might be about time it was redesigned slightly and/or republished so that everybody can see the real game under the hype).

A wargame without dice. A tense boardgame. This game is fantastic, and it's not only because I've played it when I was a teen (though it may help).
It should be a 10, because:
- There's not much luck,
- Turns are timed and moves can't be undone, so I don't have to wait forever for slooow thinker, or analysis paralized people.
But in the end I don't give it a 10, just because sadly not many people like it, so I can't play it as much as I'd like. Also, if a player gets behind, there's not much that can be done to come back in the pack...

RATING: 6
Normaly I rate recent games but now I have to rate a game that has already more of 20 years of age. How to be fair?
The gameplay reminded me of "Command & Conquer" the computer game as you gather ore and produce tanks for defensive or attacking reasons. As you usually have 15 actionpoints per turn for movement and actions, how the game develops is depending on the players: For half of the game they could collecting ore without fighting if they want so. On the other hand you can attack right away. The experience therefore may be anything between harmless to cutthroat. As I didn't enjoy the endgame (turn 21 to 25 with restrictions to the liftoff)it prevents me to rate it higher. The bits to color code your miniatures are the tiniest I've ever seen, they should have added a pair of tweezers to the game. However no luck involved, all information is open.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting game of resource harvesting on another planet.

Movement points work very well as does the ending your turn quickly. If you pass it five moves to soon you get a red cube. If you pass it 10 or more to soon you get two cubes (max is two allowed in your stack)
You can use them in one of your other turns for additional moeent points (so a total of 25)

Weather ( high tide or low tide) is an influence as this can leave you stranded and vulnerable for attack.
the turn is kept in the box. verey nicely done indeed. You can take off the planet in turn 21. there are no penalty points for what you leave behind from stuff which is kind of surprising. But it makes sense to as everything you take with you is scored. the rare minerales (just small stones guess they ran out of budget)score two everything else scores one 'even the turrets score one)
 
Loved it.

FMP is a game that has not much similar ones out today. It creates a very tense atmosphere of players calculating and thinking of their next move. There is no dice luck involved. Yet it somehow doesn't really feel like you have too much options on what you are going to do next. Its either move units, shoot or capture enemies or collect ore. But as ore wins you the game, mainly you will go for the latter.

I wavered over rating this one.  Not because I had any doubts about it being good -it just happens to be one of the most stressful games going.  The time limit on each move (without which the game would probably bog down) leaves you feeling totally drained, but completely sated at the end of a session. Your NEED four players though - one to play, one to timekeep, one to check and one to rest/get the drinks!

Best sci-fi action-point system game EVER. No luck (well, maybe a very little bit), no dice... just what your mind can come up with. The units are so unique in their function and very different that you have to learn how to use them optimally and combine their use. Difficult like chess, but just as complicated and rewarding. It has a million times the flavor of Chess, but there are downsides... rules can be hard to remember for newcomers and its very expensive to get a hold of.

Played the video game only. Good strategy game. Some luck is involved when it comes to the tides. Has a good head to head battle system, using tanks and boats.

Second copy... This one never hits the table anymore since I becomes very hard to get more than 4 players willing to play/learn FMP. (Sold in 2016).

A nice game of pure strategy with great pieces. The Player markers are a little small though. And the combat takes a bit of getting used to. I've only played it once face to face 2 player without a timer. I now look forward to playing a proper game with 4.

Excellent game, where tactical skills are much more important than any random aspects ( no dices here ).

Not a bad little war/resource/manoueouvring game. FMP is quite elegant and ahead of it's time. Players have an average of 15 action points to use over three minutes. All actions usually cost 1AP and you can move, attack, conquer opponents' pieces, harvest ore, convert ore into units etc. There are ships, barges, tanks. It all comes together with a little diplomacy as people try to jostle for position and sneak attacks when they're least expected. The timer keeps things ticking along nicely BUT this game seriously rewards experience as they rules for combat require careful positioning. This one needs a modern makeover!

Well, it is like a Real Time Strategy Computer game before they were widely available, so it has that going for it.  But unlike a RTS game your units never bother to defend themselves.  You can save action points from turn to turn and make power moves which can wipe out the most strategically defended position.  Through much of the game it feels like your units just sit there smoking cigarettes while their buddies get wiped out. 

I strongly recommend playing this with four over three as when two players team up on another they will leave their backs open, with three there isn't much stopping a gang up problem.

The game runs a bit long and mostly is just about the logistics of moving ore back and forth until some player whomps another player.  All fine and good, but not all that exciting, especially when the one unit that can produce other units gets blown up.  Then there is nothing worthwhile to do for the rest of the game, except hold out until you can take off.  Not my idea of an exciting or compelling situation. Perhaps if you could take off at any time the game would be a little less tedious.

There are some nice ideas, but there are just better ways to spend your time.

One of my all-time favourites.  Real depth of strategy, it combines wargame and resource utilisation in a way that was years ahead of its time (and a forerunner to all the Command & Conquer-type computer games).  And yet the rules are simple and elegant.  Varied terrain, and even that changes with the tides!  Nice metal miniatures (but they're better when painted IMHO - see picture).  Way OOP, and totally stupid prices to buy one - but probably still worth it.

Way ahead its time. Pretty neat mechanics (especially the Tide) that fit perfectly with the theme. Some balance issues and kingmaking is possible, but who cares if the game is so fun as it is?
Oh, and the metal bits are amazing and add a lot to its whole flavour.
All in all, it's great, too bad it's OOP and can only be found at some ridiculous prices...

The components are amazing. Really amazing. However, the game is not very interesting or well developed. It's basically a Real Time Strategy computer game in board game form, only instead of Real Time you have 15 action points and 3 minute turns. But the same ideas are there: You harvest resources and use them to build more troops, so you can attack your enemies to get more resources, etc... Having so many action points available on a turn, plus the ability to stock up to 10 for later turns, sort of makes it impossible to defend yourself very well. It also makes it ridiculously hard to plan your move, hence the timer to deal with AP issues.  On the whole it's very unsatisfying for the greatness of the metal minis. Not worth the price it currently goes for.

Exchanged Bluenose, Sprint and Sovereign of the Seas for it...It's a game deserving of about a 9, but I find the style of play unnerving. Not my cup of tea.

Great game, very little luck, a lot of strategy, many different aspects(changing weather, resource collection, unit management, warfare)great miniatures. But i don&#039;t understand: beautiful miniatures but cheap rocks for minerals, and terribly small plastic bits to mark the player color of each unit. And when it&#039;s not your turn you&#039;re a sitting duck, at the mercy of your opponents. But it is still a great wargame.

played with not much of an idea how to play.  we probably had some of the rules wrong, but it was fun, and not too much of a blowout.  way way too many things to do, but not enough action points.  the little bits to signify control are too small.

Too bad that this gem has never been reprinted, when tons of new gaming crap are printed each year. Apparently, because one of the 3 authors doesn't agree. There's a petition running, trying to convince him that there's a major interest in the gamers' community: http://www.skrol29.com/petitionfmp.php?lang=2

04/20/06:  Rating:  7 (after 1 play):  I haven't played any other board game that's like FMP.  The point of the game is to optimize your action point allowance to maximize both your ore intake and possible combat with your enemies.  This game has a lot of strategic options, ie:  to collect near or far ore first, how much of your ore to convert into combat units, when to save up actions, when to attack your opponents, etc.  It is a very intersting game, but in order to justify its current price you would have to play it almost exclusively at the expense of other games, and I just don't believe it's worth it.  On the other hand, this type of game will most certainly appeal to certain people much more than it does to me, and I can't think of a suitable substitute for it.  As an aside, the combat in Massive Assault 2 (video game) is quite reminiscent of FMP

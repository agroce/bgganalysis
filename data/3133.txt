RATING: 6
Seems like an okay pick-up-and-deliver game.  Captain Park moves like Dr. Lucky, but there is more meat to this game than Kill Dr. Lucky (KDL).  I'm not a fan of "story-telling games", but this one works out okay since there's enough of a euro/abstract/economy game in here... plus, unlike KDL, you don't have to deal with the constant "not dead yet" cards.  I've played twice with 4p, but now I want to try a 7p game because there are so few of them (and good ones are even scarcer).

The other great success from my first big games order. You try and copy the eponimous Captain and fake your own epic adventures while he as a rather clever game mechanic tries to stop you. Lots of fun, especially if people have to weave the adventure cards they play into a story when they come to claim their points. A Cheapass classic.

Great theme and some interesting decisions as well. Gameplay can be a bit random, but the humour makes up for it. The first time I played it, we acted like Victorian gentlemen when the active player described his imaginary expedition, with many a "bravo" and "stunning" and "huzzah".

I am giving it a seven because 1)it's funnier than heck, and 2) it was OK with 2 players, but I think it would really shine with 3 or more.

RATING: 6
Cheap Ass games will always fair pretty well in my ranking since they usually are a fun/funny game with simple mechanics and a low price tag. Add to this that they make great filler games to break up the day long events when back to back hour+ long games can get overwhelming even to seasoned platyers.

Captain Parks is a good example of such a game the mixes humor and clever back stabbing play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
UPDATE: Like most Cheapass games, there isn't much here once you get past the premise (which I have to admit is kind of funny).

Funny text on cards, I think it gets tedious fast, but my wife liked it a little more than I did. Sold it.

Probably the most amusing James Ernest game of CheapAss games fame. Game play really a 5 but +1 amusement factor as I can't stop laughing at the idea that everyone at the explorer's club never went on any real adventures and just bought stuff around town pretending to have gone on them. Really needs a remake from a real game designer like the guy who did Prodigals Club

Sounds like fun until you play it. Too much luck and not enough control; too slow and clunky; too complex for what it is. Americans like it because of the supposedly humorous Olde English comments on the cards, but they were written by Americans so are crap. It is cheap, but there are much better free games.

RATING: 6.5
Feels pretty balanced.  It does require somehow keeping track of some numbers that add up a lot, which I'm never good.  (And also how when I needed 200 points to win on my first game, I ended up with 197).   I probably wouldn't refuse to play it again but it probably wouldn't be on the top of any my lists.

Some practical notes.  You probably could have all players use the same month counters.  I'd estimate you need about 12 month counters per person playing to be safe.  You only probably need about five or six nickel sized counters per person that could also probably be generic for "novelty" factor.  You do need colored pieces to represent players and Captain Park.

Nice light filler game if you're in the mood for sillyness. I'm not entirely sure what the strategy is. I theorise that it is due to the cards you get that will drive your strategy to either stay out a long time or do a quick expedition.

Possible house rule for 3 players would be to double Captain Park's speed. He never had a chance of catching any of us in the 3 player game.

I think this is better then Dr. Lucky, with which it shares some basic motifs.  I admit, the text on the cards is a big part of the appeal, but it plays quite well, too.  Maybe a bit heavy on the math.

In my opinion, probably the best Cheapass game.  Love the concept and the flavour of the game - wandering around London collecting dodgy props and concocting an improbable story of one's supposed excursions.  Always a great laugh - however we take care not to play it often since the joke would wear thin with over-exposure.

Like the idea, like the cards, dislike the board of 'London' and the fact that in a turn, equivalent to a month's time in-game, your movement is unrealistically restricted. But then, it is a cheap ass game, and what you get for your money is good.

RATING: 4
A somewhat boring clone of the Kill Doctor Lucky mechanic.  The biggest disadvantage is that the mechanic, which relies on avoiding the Captain (the opposite of Kill Doctor Lucky), has no real downside.  The win can still be obtained depsite this, if played correctly.  Would only call this fun in a light-hearted sense.

GAME: Battles of the Bulge: Celles
RANK: 3453
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Solid operational game.
Chit pull with random activations for the german and Allied units. In some way the mechanics are similar to Across 5 Aprils but adapted to the mechanized warfare in WW2.
Low counter density.
Some units can activate more than once and because that are particular deadly. Lots of opportunities for both sides.  Great fluidity in the movement of the units.
Gorgeous winter map full of roads and intersections. 
A game can be played 01:30-02:30.
Hope to see scenarios with the same scale on the Estern Front 1941-45.

Battle of the Bulge games are a dime a dozen, but this is worth taking a look at. It has a fresh feel to it with innovative chit pull ideas that do a solid job of capturing command & control as well as air power and fuel logistics. This only covers a small portion of the campaign and that is fine because there are plenty of big games that cover the whole enchilada, and I don't think this game would work as a 14 hour monster game, but for a relatively quick (2 hour) folio game, it is jam-packed full of game.

Celles models an interesting situation.  The German starts with the initiative, but most of his units are off the map.  He needs to stretch even thinner American forces to prevent the powerful American armor from concentrating its firepower.  The roads are properly critical, with cross-country movement costs prohibitive.  

Changing momentum is simply but effectively handled through variations in the numbers of activations for each side.  Just as the German reaches full strength, he sees his ability to mount a coordinated attack ebb away. As ever, the chit pull system brings tension and variability, though I do agree with Iain K's comment that the luck of the draw can be strong in Celles. I like the tactical chits, reminiscent of FAB Bulge's assets, though, again, I agree that the Allied Air seems over-powered.  I think next time I'll house rule that it only attacks a unit or takes away a German action, not both.

If it wasn't already clear, Celles presents a very fluid and uncertain situation.  It gives both sides plenty to think about and fret over.  I like it quite a lot.

The rules are nicely readable.  However, the crucial rules on when a unit is spent are inadequately explained - and only in an example of play, a pet bane of mine.  The map artwork is pleasing and the counters are functional.  A box would have been nice, but it's not like I paid for one.

The first few plays were just a quick tests to get familiar with the rules. Even so I enjoyed the game a lot. After that I played -solo- the first full game: thrilling and full of exciting decisions.

The chit-pull system, with the addition of the tactical options, gives several alternatives in each turn, which opens different roads to try to get the final goals.

RATING: 8.5
Very enjoyable game -- I can see it becoming one of my favorites.  The 'wave attacks' mechanic gives it a unique flavor.  

The game seems unbalanced in favor of the Allies, but then, as I read the about the battle, it _was_ unbalanced.  The Germans had just about reached the end of their tether by the time they neared the Meuse -- the fierce resistance in the early part of the battle had taken its toll, and the fact that the Americans still held the road junction of Bastogne further restricted the size of the spearhead and the flow of its supplies.   

One of the commenters has criticized the chit-pull mechanism in this game.  I'm not a fan of that mechanism myself; it does randomize a game, but it also eliminates a significant element of careful planning.  In my second play I modified the chit-pull:  upon drawing a formation chit the player can play any formation which has not been activated that turn.  

The game was an Allied blow-out:  this change seems to work to the advantage of the Allies overall.  In my next game I plan to give the Germans free activation for five moves -- the four night moves and the first day move -- and the Allies free activation for the last three day moves.  This should help balance the game and has an element of realism.

A very fun first game in a (hopefully) series of games by Revolution covering the Bulge. The combined use of Activation Chits and Tactical Chits results in a great deal of variability, considering how small the game's footprint is. The map is gorgeous, and the counters, while initially appearing somewhat bland, actually allow the map to shine through by not detracting from it. The rules could use better formatting, but they are short enough to decipher when any issues arise.

I'd certainly recommend the game, especially for its look and its overall playability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
On the plus side, this game succeeds at capturing many elements that we love about The Bulge: tense races for crossroads, isolated defenders that hold out despite the odds, the Germans pushing their luck ... all in a short play time and without too many rules or chrome.

However, after five plays (2 solo) I doubt I'll play again.

I have yet to see a German win and only had two games that weren't an Allied VP blowout (with 2-3 turns remaining).  I suspect that this is due to play style and a steeper learning curve for the German player.  But still, tactical chits like Air Power can *really* open a can of hurt on the German defensive perimeter late game allowing a massive 2nd Armored exploitation.

And let's face it: recent scholarship, personal accounts, and declassified Air Force documentation have all tempered the inflated potency of tactical air power in WWII ... but not here. The model here is one that would make a title produced in the 80's blush.  A chit that eliminates an entire "battalion equivalent" from the map *and* magically reduces German supply (ie activations).  Was Allied air power used in such a focused way?  Was it so successful in the mountainous and woody Ardennes?

The game also has subtle interactions that can have profound implications.  For example, attackers only advance one hex but defenders retreat two.  Thus if an attacker makes a prepared attack costing all their MPs, they can not maintain contact with the retreating defenders.  This can make a retreat very beneficial to a defender as it saves them the cost (2MPs) of leaving an enemy ZOC and does not make them Spent (or "Used").  Sometimes the best thing that can happen to a defender that wishes to reposition themselves is to be attacked and forced to retreat.

As one would hope, roads are critical in the Ardennes ... but they play absolutely no role in tracing supply.  So we're left with a chit pull system that describes itself as modeling the vagaries of fuel supply and yet one can activate units that have no discernible way to be receiving fuel supplies, while other units ... within the "German Rear Area mind you, are unable to activate.

I also don't care for the fact that one doesn't choose which chits to put in the cup, not even from among a limited pool.  This takes players out of the driver's seat and accentuates the worst in chit pullers.  Leading to sessions when critical divisions *never* move.  We had a session were the German 116th did not activate during the entire game which really limited the German likelihood of victory (they lost in a landslide).

So the game isn't a simulation.  It's fun, it brings the flavor of The Bulge to the table in a short playing time, but its blend of mechanics and design assumptions might not be for everyone.

On an ergonomic note, while attractively produced, the game has a few foibles.  The setup and reinforcement tables is on the back of the rules and utilizes low res gray-scale images of the counters.  This would be OK except that units only enter when activated. i.e. they do not necessary enter on the turn indicated.  So players need to devise their own holder area for reinforcements and cross reference them to the turn of entry.

Counter colors could have been better chosen as well.  One German formation is dark blue on grey while another is black on grey.  The British formation is black on dark brown.  A single American unit is blue on olive green and worst of all the 84th US infantry is dark olive green on olive green ... it of course sets up next to the solo member of the 3rd Armored which is black on olive green. Unit strengths are pretty standardized, but the color issue make formation ID and learning the game more difficult then it needs to be.


update upon sale of the game ----------------------

This just wasn't going to get back on the table.  The All In-Select Out command chit approach wasn't to our tastes and I remained unconvinced that it applies to the situation being modeled.  The argument that it models fuel supply problems rings a bit false when formations within the "secure German Zone" go unactivated and other formations far from German lines and with no discernible supply line by road are activated.  Are these forward formations finding enough time to siphon fuel from abandoned Allied equipment?

We found this an issue that, once seen, can not be unseen.  Adding in the odd supply tracing, along with the crazy air power and resurrection chits; we simply couldn't enjoy Celles as either a game or as a consim.  Others might like this sort of approach to chaos management, but it just isn't for us.

Amazing. Small footprint for manageability yet so much opportunity for maneuvering. Chit pull mechanic throws yet another piece of uncertainty into the mix. Fun and tense every game...and its small size means it comes to the table more often. 

With many games I can get frustrated with consistently no wins. Here it is very much about the fun of the journey (and the drive for one more game to try and eke out a win for the other side). Easily an excellent game for beginners with more than enough meat to it to satisfy the more experienced.

Four games in now, and I have to say that this is a really smart design. There are a number of things to like in the design ... the chit-pull mechanic nicely models the vagaries of WW2 supply and lack of perfect command-and-control. The tactical chits add a nice element of support to your units. The rules are well written and small in footprint. The map design is beautiful. The alternating night-day strategic movement rules and motorized road crowding works really well. The whole game is nice, tense little battle that can go to either side depending on planning, player decisions, and the results of battle. The low density of counters and simple stacking rules also work well. Counters clipped.

Great for solo play and plays through in about two or two-and-a-half hours. Really nice smaller wargame. Recommended.

Ordered via Revolution during November 2017 sale. $20 is simply a steal for this game!

I had my first play two weeks ago, and find the movement allowance system very interest.  For example, 3 allowance point is required for a minor attack, 6 for a medium attack etc.  This demands planning ahead otherwise the heavy attack DRM would not be applicable.  A very nice small game.

RATING: 8
This is really a quite remarkably well-designed game.  Lots of replayability, lots of uncertainty (good for solo play!), and a very well-balanced set of victory conditions that makes the game competitive for both sides (the Germans will almost certainly lose the battle but can win the game).  More of the decision making rests with Germans, but they have a variety of quite different and interesting choices to make.  My score is a bit low for the praise above because something just didn't quite grab me about the game though.  Perhaps I was expecting more because of all of the glowing reviews from folks whose opinions I respect?  I suspect that part of the problem is that I'm getting a bit tired of hex-and-counter games and favoring area-impulse types of thing; I feel like too much time is spent counting hexes to maximize movement and that sort of thing which is brain power I'd rather put more into strategy.  At any rate, I do like all the sorts of things that Revolution Games are doing with chit pulls to add randomization to the games.

I played this today for the first time. I really like the system. You have both sides surging and counterattacking against a clock that may or may not be your friend. The chit pull system mixed with assets which might become available makes for a struggle where no one can depend on much. Unfortunaly we had to call the game after seven turns due to time constraints but I think we will be playing again very soon.

The rules are quite easy to absorb.  Operational level game at 1 mile to the hex.  Great scale that I always preferred.  The action and tactical chits drawing, coupled with fluid enemies ZOCs (no stopping on entering ZOC!), infantry infiltration movement from eZOC to eZOC, it looks like there is really a game of imminent final German breakthrough finally. Combat is a function of movement whereby movement points are spent to conduct light, medium and heavy attacks.  Units become spent and the counters are flipped to denote the status.  The other friendly units, though participated in a combat, would not be spent the same.  So they can make another attack right after the first one which was initiated by a moving unit.  This is called "wave attacks" by the designer and I believe, it is really a very nice way to depict the actual combat tactics at the time! 

We played the game of Battles of the Bulge: Celles yesterday for commemorating the beginning of the final push to the Meuse river by the Germans back in 1944! Combat is a function of movement as movement points are spent to conduct light, medium and heavy attacks. If the unit just arrive to attack, most of the time it is only a light attack with -2 modifier. 

The game ended in Allied win with 3VPs margin (well, strictly speaking 5VPs margin as Andrzej's Germans failed to control the town Rochefort with a unit). We both love the game as it projects many possibilities with the chits-drawing system. The action chits of the formations and the tactical chits coming up at different time would definitely have effects on the strategy you are going to adopt. Andrzej complained about he couldn't pull the tactical chits before the formation ones while I complained about the poor dice-rollings of the day! After the game, it is a definite next-to-buy for me! (Done it in Sep 2014 two years after the first play and $3 increase more than the preorder price.  Still a great buy at this price point.)

Love this game! Playable in one sitting. The game I played came down to the last roll- a one point differential in VPs. Chit draw mechanism ensures replayability. Hoping for more games in this system.Components are nice, but the color scheme used on the American infantry needs improvement-hard to see the combat and movement factors.

RATING: 6.5
Celles takes you to the forefront of the Bulge in the Battle of the Bulge - the final gasp of the drive on the Meuse.  Units range from battalions to kampfgruppe to combat command halves (i.e. task forces).  While it seems a bit ad hoc, it's the way units actually fought, something rarely seen in the wargaming world.  The system uses an IGO-UGO sequence of formation (mostly divisions) chit draw, but with the twist that supplies are limited and erratic, so not all formations get activated in a turn.  Again, this is closer to how things really went in WW II than to a well-organized wargame world.

The CRT-based combat system yields a reasonable mix of step losses, retreats, and disruptions, but unless you're lucky or clever you can't take advantage of a disrupted enemy unit (Napoleon always preferred lucky in his marshals, I begin to see why).  The slick use of unit flipping to track the negative impact of movement on combat capability is nice, as is movement point cost of prepared attacks, with their positive DRM.  What chrome there is captures some of the differences between the two armies, primarily in air support and doctrine.

The rules are terse and clear, and the 1/2-map game is unit sparse, so you you can get up and playing in 90 minutes.  Game play doesn't take much more than that.  It's a good thing too, as the tactics take some learning.  I only played one game, late in a gaming day, and would probably have rated Celles a bit higher if I'd played it several times back-to-back to test various approaches.  It's HARD to break through as the Germans, even with good chit draws.  In contrast, a fairly passive defense early on can hold on for the Allies if they're smart in the few units they do move.  The victory conditions are well designed, giving the Germans alternative paths to success if they fail to break through.  None of this is a surprise if you read the player notes, but reading them is one thing and playing well quite another.  In short, Celles' rules are beer-and-pretzels easy, but the game itself is a real brain teaser.

The materials were nice: a robust winter-themed map, largish pieces with unit insignia on the chits, and a player aid on solid, glossy card stock.

Attractively produced, fast-playing game covering a critical sector of the Bulge. The chit pull-based system hums along smoothly enough once a couple of clarifications from the designer are in hand.

How much it really models operational warfare in the Ardennes I wouldn't venture to say: there's no command and control beyond individual formation activation. Much hinges on the luck of the draw, specifically the tactics chits which have the ability to resuscitate units from the dead pile (key not just for their fighting potential but because they're no longer worth VP to the other side), and the Allied airpower, which seems crazy powerful.

Enjoyable small footprint game. Clever activation systems brings randomness and nuances to play, so that there feels like there is a lot of action going on in a small space (half mapper), like every hex matters and so the game stays fresh. 

I have played plenty of Bulge games and never got to Celles (the furthest point of the German advance), so this game gives me a chance to play of that area and certainly be within striking distance of the Meuse.

It takes around two and a half hours for decisive players to play, but play can be quite considered, so if you or your opponent are more 'cerebal' players, then add an hour onto that time.

This is a very innovative game design. Kudos to the designer for his imagination and rules writing. I don't customarily like chit pull games, but this one is an exception. For me, it fell short of a 10 due to play balance. An aggressive "Lightning Joe" Allied Player is more than likely to hand the German Player his own head on a platter. That aside, excitement level is high, and the game is not difficult to learn and play. So far, I played it twice. The German Player must quickly get two or three units next to the Meuse to start accumulating VPs, likely done with Panzer Lehr. A battle for Marche can turn into a quagmire, but it is needed to draw off some of the Yank's powerful 2nd Armor units. As the German Player, suck up your losses and try to maintain those units next to the Meuse in supply.

RATING: 7
A nice combination of chit-pull and scale.  Each player has their own pool of chits into which are also included tactical enhancements.  As not all chits will be pulled each turn, this adds to a nice variability and tension each turn (also replayability).  By having two chit pools (one per player), the game nicely combines chit-pull with IGO-UGO avoiding a common complaint where one player does nothing while the opponent gets several chits in a row.

The game starts with the German momentum, but by Christmas this swings to the American so the German player must push hard to start then hang on while the Americans do just the opposite.

Small map area, low counter density, and short (couple of hours) playing time make this a nice game to have in a convention bag or just to break up other games.

This game packs so much into just a few counters and a relatively small map. The rules are quite streamlined so that all of the important stuff (supply, ZOCs, etc.) is covered without making the game too complicated or cluttered. The game uses a chit-pull system, which makes it well-suited to solo play and keeps the suspense going. The activation chits are mixed with special chits that also add a bit more tactical flavour.

The map artwork is really nice!

In my first play the Allies won by a narrow margin (19VPs to 17VPs) thanks to their capturing the key objective of Marche in the last action of the game. Things going right down to the wire like this suggests that the game is also very well balanced.

In many ways, this game reminds me of the excellent Grand Tactical Series, condensed down into a smaller, simpler, and more portable package.

I have played both Celles and Gazala, which share the same system.  I have mixed feelings on the system.  I find the movement/combat to be very gamey, but it does add several tactical decisions.  I found it hard to accomplish much in this game.  Battles were rarely decisive.  If you left the roads,  you barely moved, but otherwise you just bogged down in battles.  This game seemed more of a grind than a fast playing and fast moving one.

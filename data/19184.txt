climbing game but two major problems.  The payoff is a pain in the ass and the fact the high tiles go 15-1-2 is a freaking mess.  

I appreciate that they kept the 2 high, and the idea of adding an 14's and 15's to make the game work with 3P and 5P was a good idea, but it doesn't overcome the other two issues.

Simply loving looking game with the mahjong style tiles but gameplay is weak as there are no wild cards so it all depends on drawing the best combinations, not going to win me over from Haggis or Tichu.

I used to play a lot of ladder card games in college (usually with cheap beer), but I forgot how fun they could be.  I was also surprised how quick each round is.  I've tried it with a couple two-player variants as well, and enjoyed exploring the differences in gameplay.

I looked and looked for the black tiles- then gave up.  Then I had to look and look for the white tiles, which had disappeared in the meanwhile...  Finally got one from Toll and Troll.

This game filled exactly the niche I hoped it would fill: simple to teach, moisture resistant, plays in under an hour, hard to loose pieces, and visually/tactilely appealing.

RATING: 6
the 5 round limit makes this a lot harder for me to turn down than tichu, although it's considerably simpler without any special card wrinkles.  if the rules i heard were correct, you can simply ignore the bit about 2 being higher than 15 and treat it like a normal trick-taker with 1 through 15 as values.  decisions are actually there to be made in terms of breaking up hands, but it's not gut-wrenching.  nice easy breezy play, and the click-clack feel does have an appeal to it.  i don't see myself buying a copy.  i'm curious about how it would play with cards, since the scoring system is somewhat interesting and the round limit encourages playing into it.

I thought this would be a "real" game but after a hand or two I felt very much at the whim of what tiles I recieved.  Maybe this has more strategy when played overy many many hands but I didn't see it in the few hands I played.

I got the black set as it seemed to be the "in" thing to do.  Unfortunately the colors are deep and rich and hard for my color blind eyes to see against the black.  I really wish I had gone white now.  

Moreover, I don't know if I really needed this game except to play five players.  This game is essentially the same game as High Two, but with some of the rules removed (which frankly makes high two the better of the two games).  Removed are 4 card sets, card attrition (or passing unwanted cards to opponents) and a couple of other things.

I've only played it online.  Perfectly decent climbing game.  Probably the only game I'd play for monetary stakes (I don't play poker).  Solid, elegantly simple, and fast, with an interesting scoring system.  Better than 'Gang Of Four' or 'The Great Dalmuti'.  Serious but not too serious.  You can play the 3 and 4 player versions with a regular set of Rummikub tiles--where it basically becomes 'Big Two' with more noise, less tolerance for house rules, and a better scoring system.  Casual gamers will like it fine once you get them past the concept of the ones and twos beating threes.

I have played online numerous times now and discovered I really enjoy this game.  I'm looking forward to playing it live with tiles and real people (and at that time, I'll rate the game). 

Update:  Played with three in person.  Good game.  Fun, some thought on how to play your hand (like any card game, climbing or trick taking).  Tiles are very nice to play with.  It's also very quick to play 5 hands.  Looking forward to playing this for money...nickel/dime a point. 

2nd update:  Played a couple more times with the same people.  It's a nice card game without cards.  You play, you can chat and if you limit the rounds to 3 - 5, it's very quick.  Great filler, end of the night game.  Bumped it up to an 8.  

Update:  It's at a 9 for me.  It's quick and fun, nothing has changed there. What has changed is the more I play it and the more othere play it, the more understanding everyone has.  Game is wow.  I can see playing this with six like you would Sheepshead.  One person sits each round and play six rounds. 

Update:  It's a 10.  I could sit and play this all night for cash.

Goes down very well with audiences that feel at least comfortable with typical card games (i.e. non-game-enthusiasts.)  The black edition is as gorgeous as people made it out to be, which helps Lexio win over new players!  It hits a real sweet spot for me: trick-taking/ladder-climbing with enough twists to be interesting, yet accessible.  With just the right blend of unique elements and rule complexity, Lexio confronts the players with nerve-wracking choices.

RATING: 5
The reason to play this game is to use the cool bits. The mah-johng style tiles are hefty and have a good feel, and are visually attractive (although I certainly wouldn't say "beautiful").

The game is just OK, though, and it's hampered by completely opaque wrap-around ranking. 2 is high, 3 is low, 2 beats a 13 but 4 beats a 3. I'm still not sure I understand straights, which can "wrap around" the high value of 2 but not around 15 (so 1-5 is valid and, I think, beats 3-8, while 12 through 1 is not valid). All this confusion adds nothing to the game except confusion.

The game is ultimately very similar to Tichu, but I like Lexio a little better just because it's short. Tichu is a cool game but the playing time of sometimes well over an hour really kills it for me, given how repetitive it is. With Lexio, you can play a hand in a few minutes and a satisfying game in half an hour or so. Not a game with much of a "wow" factor, I felt, but it's short enough to be a nice change of pace occasionally.

As an aside, it seems like Lexio really is meant to be played for money. But, if you get a lousy hand, you can't fold or whatever - you can just do the best with what you've got. This seems to me that it would make it uninteresting as a gambling game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely a case of the cool bits influencing my enjoyment of the game.  In fact, this is probably the perennial example of this phenomenon.  It's basically just a ladder game, and a pretty typical one at that.  However, play it with mah-jong-like tiles instead of a deck of cards, and it's suddenly pretty awesome!  The scoring is neat in that after each hand players pay each other according to the difference in their remaining tiles, meaning whoever goes "out" receives payments from everyone, while the rest of the players will be paying each other as well.  Whatever merits the game has on its own, you're still playing this because of the sweet tiles, though.

RATING: 6.5
Lexio is very similar to the card game ”President” or ”asshole” as it’s called in Denmark (not that we think the US President is an asshole, mind you!). Mix it with some poker hands and add that some colors trumph others, and you’ve basically have Lexio. It was actually pretty enjoyable, and it’s a game I would play again as it’s very quick. However, the decisions are pretty basic so the strategic aspects lack a little. 

I liked that the colors aren’t equally strong and the fact that you get minus points if you’re sitting with a 2 when the game ends (which actually happened in our last round). You play 3 quick rounds and every loser pays the difference in the tiles they have left compared to the other players; so, the winner get points from every other players’ stacks, while the runner-up player gets points from number three and four etc. This is a good mechanic as you’re all trying to finish as fast as possible, and even if you don’t win the round you’ll likely still get a few points from the biggest loser of the round. 

There is still the luck of the draw when you’re grabbing your starting tiles, so you need to understand that it’s not a super heavy game and that you can get screwed if you get some poor tiles. In my game there was actually a player who had a really strong series of tiles while I had a maximum of two similar tiles, but as they didn’t want to break their nice straight etc., they passed which actually meant that I won the round with a very bad hand consisting of no 2’s, no suit/flush and only singles and pairs… So the moral of the story is that you shouldn’t be too gready if you’re sitting with a strong hand! I do think the game is good, but it’s just not something I would like to play all the time, hence my rating of just 5.5 (which almost might as well have been a 6).

It's just OK.  It tries to be Tichu with it's trick building aspect and a goal of wanted to lose all your cards.. I mean tiles - but it doesn't have all the fun bits like passing cards and bombs that add layers.  The production on the tiles is fantastic except for the fact that shuffling them is a nightmare.  Actually, I might like it a bit better if you could actually shuffle the tiles more efficiently without having them turn over every wash.

24+ plays (3p, 4p, 5p). Clearly a stand-out game - I have a lot to learn to play it well, but that's a good kind of pain. Ladder games are a new mechanic for me, getting rid of your tiles/cards by escalating ~poker values. I like the relative scoring method that involves everyone. I'm not a poker fan but I really like Lexio's use of poker formations. It's also helping me understand the Ladder game concept. Beautiful, too. The tiles are fabulous and add to the fun. So I'd say it has potential for me. Update: I bought a copy (Francesca version). Lexio was an enthusiastic hit with my non-gamer friends who had no problem understanding the special roles of the 2s and 1s. The changcheng variants posted here look fun to try. Hertzog's "pass tiles L,R,C" (a la Hearts) look even more promising, could reduce the luck factor (?) (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/210268) at the cost of adding more time to the short game. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Manila_jeu.jpg/220px-Manila_jeu.jpg Update: Friends are requesting this one come back to the table. Update: Now a few years later, friends still requesting this.

Tichu Junior. Take Tichu:
Remove:
a) partnerships
b) the special cards
c) the bombs
d) ability to play runs of pairs
e) ability to play straits longer than 5
f) Points for anything other than going out

Add: a nice scoring system where everyone has to pay everyone else a number of chips equal to the difference of their hands at the end of the hand (e.g. player who goes out receives chips from all other players).

It's hard to really recommend the game other than for the nice bits, and as an introduction to Tichu. But even then, you could just play Tichu without the special cards and use Lexio scoring.

I tend to use this only as an introductory game, mainly to those who I think won't ever play Tichu.

Excellent filler game with some thought and strategy but if you draw dross tiles all night you will still lose.

Not having a really bad round is probably more important than taking a chance to have a really good one.

I guess it doesn't do much that Tichu doesn't but it does do it with a quite wonderful set of bakelite tiles which earn it a full extra point from me.

Quite a bit lighter than Tichu (not partners, simpler scoring, no unique cards) and therefore more luck based. However, the tiles have a terrific "clack factor" and the lighter rules make it more accessible to nongamers. Poker chips improve the experience.

Apparently these mechanisms are used with more strategy in other games, but they don't have the fancy tiles, do they?

This is a nice trick taking game.  Frankly, I don;t really understand why 1 & 2 are the high cards when the game would be virtually the same if they were the low and 14 & 15 were the high.  I guess that's how they worked in the "wrap around" for the one but it seems silly IMO. Still, it's simple enough and it's a fun game. I've only played this online so my rating is uneffected by the quality of the actual game pieces, so take that for what it's worth.

First impressions:  Meh.  Didn't play well with 3 players, but would like to play again with 4.  Initially, I wanted this as a 3-player alternative to Tichu, but it fails in that respect.  Even if it's good with 4, would I ever want to play this instead of Tichu?  Not likely.

RATING: 5
I probably should give this game another chance, but since I played it at Origins and don't have access to it otherwise, there's a good chance I won't.  Trick taking ladder game with tiles instead of cards.  Well, you can't play ladder pairs like you can in Tichu, but you can play pairs, sets, and 5-card combos.  Scoring is based on the number of tiles people have left when someone goes out.  The people with more tiles give money to the people with fewer tiles, with one tile counting as a doubler.

Very addictive, nice climbing game, in the same family as Gang of Four and Tichu. The bakelite tiles make for a great aesthetic touch, even in the white version.

The fascination of Lectio comes from playing with the big blocks. Cards could be used as well but the experience would suffer. The game itself is solid but not outstanding. A basic ladder game of getting rid of cards first with the common decision point: holding out for the big combos or playing a single tile now to get rid of it. The most interesting element is the scoring. Players have to pay a point per additional tile to each other player that has less tiles left than they do. The result is a pleasant session closer.

It is a fun little game.  It explains quickly. The mechanics are easy to grasp. Yet, there is some thinking involved.  And the components are neat. The only downside is that once the winner goes out of tiles, the round ends.  I like the idea of playing for second and third, although unnecessary.

Fun, nicely produced "ladder" game using tiles instead of cards. Everyone starts with the same amount of chips and then tries to get rid of their tiles asap. Uses a clever scoring method of paying each other the difference of tiles remaining (with any “2s” doubling the payment).  Good filler.

Played once, 4p.  I enjoyed the game, well enough.  The strategy did not become apparent in the first game.  However, it may not be worth owning this and Tichu if you usually play with 4 only.  This game has the advantage over Tichu for 3 or 5 players.  This game has a very similar feel to Tichu, but plays quicker.

Beautiful tiles to this game but this is a card game decked out as tiles.  Everyone plays for themselves in this climbing game as you seek to be the first to play out of tiles.  I'd recommend just playing Tichu.  Probably, this would play best with 3, maybe 4 players.  I'm glad I played as I've been curious, but my itch has been scratched...:-)

But I'm happy to report that I have finally got my hands on a real set, courtesy of Land of Games, and the tiles are fantastic. I can see that this will get much play with friends who don't game much beyond studying a poker hand. And you don't have to worry about spills! Quick, lively game, easier than Tichu and with a nice scoring mechanism to keep the game balanced. A pity it is so hard to obtain outside South Korea.

I own the Black version and it is simply the most gorgeous looking game I can imagine.  Very classy.  The plastic chips are extremely lame compared to the high production quality of the tiles. I suggest substituting some clay poker chips.

Have played numerous times with my extended family and they love it!  It's not a gamers game but it is a fun poker/tichu/euchre romp that can get aunt Matilda swearing and your cousin Phil ready to punch you in the mouth.  Good stuff!

Liked it so much I implemented on online version where you can play against computer opponents. Try before you buy!

Climbing game, plays like a cardgame of the Tichu family, but with tiles instead of cards. Very much Tichu light though, not much control. Strategically passing in order to not break up your combinations is not so smart here. The point scoring favours that you just put down as many tiles as you can, when you get the chance.

Good game. It's a bit like poker without the bluffing (No, that's not necessarily a bad thing), played in rounds to get rid of your playing pieces.

The nice clacky stones do add to the gameplay, I'm enjoying playing this way more than I would with ordinary cards. Besides the fysical experience and looks: It's a lot easier to rearrange blocks than to rearrange cards for example.

For a long time I thought that the pleasant tactile experience of slapping down the thick, chunky tiles in Lexio appealed to my shallow sensibilities, causing me to rate the game more highly than it actually deserved.  Now I'm convinced that it's just a really fantastic game.  I  can't think of many other games about which I can honestly say that I would always be willing to play.  It's a tight hand management, climbing game with a bit of bluffing.  Skillful play is usually rewarded.  But there can be some wild swings.  If you get the timing just right, you can go from a precarious situation to winning the hand.  But it's also easy to be a little too cute, and get hammered.  And as an added bonus, you get to slap down thick, chunky tiles!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lexio is a climbing game of the lighter kind (players throw single cards or melds that have to trump the previous ones, i.e. include cards with higher suit or value). Even though there are some decisions that are not trivial and can spice the game up quite a bit, it's easy to feel at the mercy of the tiles you've been dealt. This applies particularly when some player starts with a flush or a straight - that player will be able to rest for a couple of turns and still win.

Played online against AI. Nice climbing game with exceptional components, although my 2014 Essen Limited Edition came with only Korean rules and player aids (and no chips, therefore I suppose scoring has changed from previous versions). Still, my favor among climbing games goes to Tichu because of the partnership element.

A tile- card game. It is climbing so runs like Tichu and got compared. It is no where near like Tichu. I LOVE Tichu. This has weird rules like the 1 is higher than the 12 and the 2 is higher than the 1. The red suit is better then the rest and you can't have steps  . It was weird. I would try it again but I am in no hurry to. I would just rather play Tichu!

The tile version of Big Two.  I love Big Two, so I love this game.  The tiles are really cool, but harder to manage.  The worst part of this game is that it's hard-to-find and expensive while Big Two is basically free since it can be played with any regular deck of cards.  Though, 5 player support with the extra tiles was cool (you'd need a Sticheln, Rage, or Die Sieben Siegel deck for that.).

Beautiful game.  Love the look and the feel.

Skillful play will rarely....RARELY.. overcome poor hands.  This is a game where a newbie could easily beat a veteran player.  Plus, the game plays on autopilot 95% of the time.  Could be decent for a gateway filler, but don't be fooled.  This poker/tichu ripoff is more about luck than anything else.  Like the old Chinese proverb says, "He who gets best hand, gets to win."  (okay, I just made that up, but it sounded authentic).

I love playing anything thats similar to 'Bones' 
This is a great ladder game...  mostly due to the tiles.  They are fun to play with and admittedly subject to variation between the white and black sets.
My group started closing our nights with this one, and the novelty of the tiles grew into a deeper enjoyment of the game.

RATING: 8
This is the tile version of the Big 2, one of my favorite games of all time.  The tiles give it a neat experience, but it limits the portability of the game.  So it is a trade-off.  The scoring mechanism helps improve the game by forcing players to use their 2's much earlier than they would like.  The only quibble that I have is that the standard game limits hand size to 12 or 13 - (more tiles increase the possibilities of getting straight flushes and four of a kinds).  I want to try out four player games with all the tiles and three player games with the red 13 omitted.

RATING: 6
Playable with Sticheln deck.

A pretty ordinary climbing game made much more interesting because of the awesome tiles. Actually, there is one other cool feature: the scoring. Players start with a pool of money (149 in poker chips). At the end of each hand (when a player manages to discard all their tiles), the losers pay everyone else 1 per tile they have in excess of the other player (pay x 2 for each tile you have of highest value).

Along with that good rule, though, is one kind of annoying rule: the 2 is highest, then the 1. Also, the 1 may be played as high card OR low card (so both 1-2-3-4-5 and 12-13-14-15-1 are legal). 

Not a bad game, but I miss the bombs and the partnerships of Tichu.

Ranking Hands:
- must play same number of tiles as what you're going over
- legal plays: single, pair, trip, five-card combo
... 5-card combos, low to high: straight, flush, full house, four-of-a-kind plus a 5th card, straight flush
... for same type of play, first compare _numbers_, then color (if numbers are the same)
... 2 highest, then 1, then numerically
... Sun (Red) > Moon(Green) > Star(Orange/Yellow) > Cloud(Black/Blue)

Beautiful Game! The tiles are fantastic, but a bit difficult to shuffle and sort. This is like Big 2, so you have to remember the 2 is max idea. Hard to adjust from Tichu, which I think I prefer. Note to self: I had black set, Red, Green, Yellow and Blue. Apparently black is the desireable one. Yeah, the white does not look as good. At the moment, I only own the print and play version.

Excellent trick taking game with bakelite tiles instead of cards.  It belongs to the same climbing games that the Great Dalmuti and Tichu are based off of.  Lexio goes fast and has the "clack factor" for those who like games with great components.  It scales well from 3 to 5, but the optimum number of players seems to be 4.  One downside is the "powerful leader" problem--once a person has a lead, a decent selection of tiles, and a good knowledge of how to play, catching them can be difficult.  Many thanks to Mr. Vasel for writing about this one.

The tiles are very nice, but I found the game itself mediocre. It could probably be improved somewhat by changing the rule that allows any higher 5-tile group to be played on a lower one (regardless of type), and by ditching the payment system in favor of written scores (which would be a lot faster), but I'm sure I'd still rather play Tichu.

The classical game of Big2 or Chor Tai Di for the Chinese folk. This game with tiles is nothing different. These set collection games really don't intrigue me as much. The tiles are extremely well-built and will stand repeated plays. However, owing to the fact that this game can be played with just cards and a heck lot more portable, I am willing to go with the card version.

This is a rather addicting game, and I haven't even played with the Bakelite tiles (just the computer version, against the bots).  It's a pale imitation of Tichu, with less tactics and strategy involved, though it has a couple of quirks that make the game different.  It seems like it's too possible to get a "bad hand," and the scoring mechanism seems like you can't really compensate for such a thing.  It's addicting and frustrating, at the same time.

Light, fun, engaging "card" game with wonderful bakelite tiles - the use of tiles instead of cards adds a wonderful tactile sensation to the game, and somehow makes it a different experience than playing with just cards. I like the payment dynamic of paying out points to players who have fewer tiles left in their hand at the end of a round. I also like the very specific 5 turn limit - it can change your decision making based on your position. The sequence and rating of suits and eligible hands takes a bit of time to get used to...

Great looking cards. My best friend and I used to be into Star Fleet Battles back in high school and we really enjoyed the artwork on the cards. Unfortunately, the game is nothing more than "Naval War in space". I think I could think of a better ruleset given some playtesting. Who has the time to twink crummy rules though when there are so many games out there that have wonderful rules.

Only played it once, using a lot of basic rules.  Seems like it would be pretty fun, although not all that deep.  Will find out after more plays, especially using the advanced rules.

MagBlast's cousin in the "Star Fleet" universe. I can't even recommend this to Trek fans, since it's just a thematic past-over of the MagBlast/Modern Naval Battles game engine. Interminable, too.

RATING: 5
Good idea, but it just doesn't seem to be implemented well. Why are all these random ships in my fleet again? Why are my Romulans shooting at his Romulans, instead of his Feds? Why does the logistics chain keep sending me R Plasma Torpedoes when they know I don't have any launchers for those? I could probably whip up some house rules that I would like better, but there are plenty of other fish in the sea.

This is probably as close to playing Star Fleet Battles with cards as you are going to get. Gameplay is good and the cards have great artwork on them. Plus you can start out with very basic rules and add as the advanced ones as you get more familiar with the game. Now we just need some expansions for it!!

A bit complicated at first, but makes sense once you get into it.  You are a fleet commander set upon destroying all other enemy ships!

I'm going to rate this high despite the fact I've never played it.  The artwork for the cards is exceptional, and I can't wait to actually sit down and play this one.  Then I may or may not change my rating.

RATING: 7
Looks awesome in terms of artwork. Appears to play in a similar fashion to Naval Battles, which is exactly what I was looking for. Only downside - would have liked more ships - may have to buy a second copy (or wait for an expansion deck). 

Update (10/7/2007): Finally played our first two games today (both 4-player). Great fun, and very easy to get into (moreso than with Naval Battles, a similar game - I appreciate cards with words on them, not just "language-independent" symbols).

Excellent Star Fleet Battles-themed successor to the old Modern Naval Battles games.  Snazzy components (love those plastic photon torpedoes!) and a lot of fun packed into a little box.

RATING: 5
Ripoff of Starship Command, but without the better SC rules.
Needs a rule modification--all players draw back to strength after each turn.
Also, annoying you end up with a mixed fleet--okay in SC, but not in the Trek universe!

RATING: 1
Poorly written rules and boring gameplay - either you have the right cards at the right time or you don&#039;t.  But the worst transgression is that a player&#039;s fleet can contain ships from multiple races, completely diluting one of the more interesting aspects of the Star Trek universe (special race abilities), and eliminating strategic possibilities.  Very disappointing.

Ok, it's a random, blow-stuff-up, MagBlast-type of game. And it still has the "whack the guy with no defence cards" problem. 

But ... got to give credit to the designer for at least recognising the pitfalls to this type of game and minimising the pitfalls that come with this type of game. So having rules like team play, time limit, reserve cards all help to keep it enjoyable. You don't want to play it too often but you don't mind breaking it out occasionally for a filler.

SFBF is a portable, easy to learn game that offers additional complexity.  Based off of Modern Navel Warfare, the Star Fleet Battles theme takes it far beyond.

Very good starship combat game. I found it to be much more accessible than some other reviewers and for the price, you can't go wrong. I play with my boys - 11 and 8 years old and we have fun. I'm glad I own it.

Played the original Star Fleet Missions, and thought I would give this a go.  It is an enjoyable game.  Once players are familiar with the game I find they go last closer to 30-60 minutes.  The rules make the game seem more complex than it really is.  Rulebooklet could do with a bit of a rewrite.

I bought SFBF at the same time as Car Wars The Card Game.  As mentioned by others, both are different takes on the old Avalon Hills 'Naval War' card game.  Although Car Wars is a much simpler game, in some ways I think it can be more strategic.  With CW, each of the four sides of the enemy car has 12 hit points, and once one side takes significant damage, it makes sense for people to try to target that side rather than the other three.
With SFBF, the victim of the attack gets to decide where to place damage markers, which seems rather artificial to me.  
I have been a Star Trek fan since the mid-70s, so I love the theme of SFBF.  The artwork and cards are terrific.  Some parts of this game work really well.
However, one aspect really kills it for me; the fact that unless you have fleets of mixed races, you may randomly pull weapon fire cards that are completely useless for several turns.  For example, if you have Klingon ships, but keep pulling cards for plasma or photon torpedoes, you can't fire your heavy weapons.  Maybe I am too much of a Trek geek, but I just don't see mixed groups of Klingon, Fed, Orion, etc ships getting along well with each other.  It might have been better to just have two races (say Klingon and Fed) and have the cards set up with the heavy weapons for those two races.
Overall, I can only rate it an 'OK' 6.5 out of 10.

Fast and easy card game with nice artwork.  I like the fact that the box it comes in is very durable plastic, so that after owning it for several years, I've yet to lose a piece.

Great game!

Changed my rating from a 7 to a 5 after my first play.

This game is over complicated for a card game. They are trying to squeeze 500+ pages of Star Fleet Battles into 30 pages of rules. When you hit step 41 on a card game it is time to rethink the rules. There is some very huge holes in the rules that break the game. Plus, don't play this game with allergies. The damage markers are just small star shaped stars that go bye-bye with one small sneeze. At least they found a use of a VHS box. 

Get someone to trim the rule down to 5 pages this would be great.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating. Based on a quick play each player had one ship four player game.  I have not played a full fleet battle where everyone has multiple ships.  To judge this game properly I would need to play a full version game.  However, I did see how the mechanics work and get a feel for the gameplay.  It was okay.  I think there is just a lot of minatures, wargames and stuff I would pick ahead of this one.  I could see where having a full fleet battle would be interesting.  I can also see where it would take a long time and be decided by random card draws.  I guess I am just more in euro-games then this type of game.

Not bad, but some mechanics are too complicated, and the scoring system is poor with more than 2 players.

RATING: 3
This is a card game where you each control a fleet of ships from the Star Trek universe and you fight it out.  You have to play appropriate cards to fire your weapons.  You also have the appropriate ships that have those weapons in order to fire them.

This is a card game version of Star Fleet Battles.  It is simpler than SFB, but there is still quite a bit of complexity in the rules.  It plays like a complex version of Mag Blast with more balance.

Star Fleet!  Loved the idea of this self contained Star Trek card game, however I really had no one to play with. Single opponent I'd consider playing against is one I'd play a number of other games with first.

I love SFB, and I like AH's Naval War game.  This combines the theme of the former with the basic mechanisms of the latter (only greatly improved), with a couple minor tweaks to better represent the source material.

The full-color artwork on both the action cards and the ships is gorgeous.  This is a high quality game at a reasonable price.  I can't understand why it's not rated higher.

Rating substantially revised up after group play in pubs.  This game REQUIRES a group.  It does, technically, play with as few as '2', but that really does feel...it's just not the same, really.

'4' is a good number, and the resulting match is light, can play very, very fast, but still has tactical depth.  Knowing when to play cards offensively, or hold them for defense...what ships to target, which to spend the most defending (or which to let be destroyed), etc.  A lot of decisions, even in the 'basic' game.

The 'advanced' game adds formations (fleets broken into three elements - 'screen', 'main body', and 'reserve', with limitations on what attacks can be made by and on ships in various positions) and some more card management...haven't played that one, but so far we've seen from the basic game, it's solid!

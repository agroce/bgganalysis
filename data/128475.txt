RATING: 7
A very simple but compelling game.  It can be picked up easily by non-gamers, but there is more than enough meat to satisfy.  It plays quickly once everyone knows what they're doing (usually by the end of the first game), and all subsequent games become very cutthroat!

RATING: 5
Simple, gothic-themed card game where the object is to spell MURDER with your cards. Beautifully illustrated, and you get a cute story out of your card arrangement when you finish, but the game's just basic "take that" card play until somebody sneaks in with the win. Why play this when there are so many great small card games out there?

Impulse register buy from a FLGS (I'm not sure which one... there are 4 or 5 I visit regularly).

Cute game, quick playing.  Not at all deep or strategic.

RATING: 7
This is a quite simple game, but with rather unusual gameplay and a charming, gothic topic; if you like gothics, you should consider this game. The game has grown on me after having played it with only two players and a house rule: a starting hand of only three cards.

Very simple game with very little strategy, but the design conceit behind it is clever, and quite charming: spell out the word MURDER (using your crows to block attacks against you) and then read aloud the details of the murder once you have all the required evidence. As a game, this is hardly worth any notice, but as a fun, light filler with a cool, moody theme, it's neat. Reminds me a lot of Gloom (but fortunately takes less than half the time to play).

RATING: 7
I love this game. The rules are easy, I teach it by explaining the basic rules and playing a quick hand.

The game takes 15 minutes a hand to play, and you get a neat murder story out of it.

Only complaints are that the box it comes it sucks, and the printing on the cards chipped a little. No worries, I sleeved them and replaced the box with an Ultrapro deck box. Much easier to deal with.

굉장히 짧은 타임을 가진 카드 게임. 테마가 살인이라서 뭘까나 하는 맘에 구입했다. 문제는 룰북이 없다. 굉장히 짧은데, 뚜쟁이님한테 부탁해 볼까!

Very simple to teach and pick up.  I was able to hand this game off to a group who had never played it before and with minimal instruction had them playing the game.  I played two player which ran very fast because every action could be countered by the opposing player almost all the time.

Murder of Crows is a quirky card game that plays quickly. It has a little strategy, but is fairly light for those nights when you don't want to think too hard. We enjoyed playing it as a fun little filler.

RATING: 6
This is pretty much Gloom but without the see-through cards, and it has a twist on how cards are played.  Players are trying to spell out the word "MURDER" in front of them, and each card played has a different ability depending on the letter - R, for example, means "Reap" so you get to draw an extra card.

The main focus on the game is protecting your line while attacking others, so stacking up cards in piles is a good defense mechanism.  There are also wild crow cards that can be used for a variety of actions and as defense.  You need a certain number to block a card - my suggestion for a faster game is to just let one crow card block any action.

Super portable, fast, and slick art here.  But it also lacks substance, and it's unfortunate there are so few cards in the deck - it makes frequent shuffling necessary.  It's a fine diversion, but won't excite hard-core gamers.

I reckon there are approximately 230 thousand possible hilarious stories the six cards of the winner will spell out at the end of each game, such as: "A rotting stench filled the air on forgotten gravestones when Samuel Scratchpad over a bad real estate deal used nail clippers to hack Joe Gooseberry." So, chances are you are never going to read the same murder mystery twice. That plus the Adams Family style artwork is worth the price of entry for me. The game itself is too chaotic for my tastes, but it has proven to be a successful end-of-the-evening filler in my small group.

5-player is too much "Take that!" screw-you-over from the other players, leading to a game that goes on for longer than it should. 3-player is just about right for the kind of game it is.

RATING: 6
This is a simple and quick playing card game that is light fun and thematically entertaining when limited to two or three games during a session.  The artwork is darkly thematic but in a whimsical way that keeps the game light and fun.  Upon first reading the rules and teaching the game, it seems like it will be a viscous game that will never end due to the take-that nature of most of the card powers.  However, actual game play shows that deflecting these attacks is rather easy and this saves the game from being a miserable, endless take-that fest.  The game would benefit from having more cards in the deck as cards that appear in one game can quite possibly appear in the next game.

This is a decent game that would fit well in a Halloween themed game session when limited to two or three rounds during the session.

This is a simple card game you to add to your collection.  Your goal is to be the first person to play cards in front of you spelling out MURDER before the other players.  It is of course not that simple.  Each card has abilities that steal cards, remove cards, grant you extra cards etc.  The thing I think that makes this really creative is that once you are over you can read your cards and it will tell you a short story.

Just spell out MURDER and read out the story that it randomly generates at the bottom of the cards that you played. Sounds simple, but as with most every game the complication comes in when your opponents are trying to do the same thing as you and they can interact with your hand and board to hinder you. I was actually given this game but it has since gone into my game bag (you know those little games that you always take to game night). 7/10 Try it out! Put it into your game bag!

A great theme, but the game is clearly an abstract and could be about anything. I quite like it as a thinking exercise (I like Chess too) but it lacks spark. We traded it.

An excellent quick card game. The goal is to be the first to spell out the word Murder.
When playing a letter out in front of you, you will be granted a one time option to claim a card in some manner.
But the best part of the game is once someone has won, each of the murder cards that you have played will connect to tell the story of the crime.

06-09-2014. Rated after 1 play. Junky game in which you try to spell murder with cards, while playing the various letters has special effects and you can protect your letters from being stolen to play multiple ones of the same type down. 

In my mind, it's too random and because people can 'steal' letters, draws it out. In my mind, it felt not much more complex or more interesting than Fluxx.

Card game where the object is to be the first to spell the word 'murder' in tableau before you. Cards only have one of the letters M U R D E on them. Cards also enable you to manipulate and affect cards in hand or on the table. When someone spells 'murder' then their cards will tell a story of that murder. Good fun, but a very limited card set harms replayability.

A unique card game with 5 types of cards, M, U, R, D, E, that each have an effect on either you or your opponents. Great art and story text, but a little chaotic towards the larger end of the player count.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Average card game with a lot of interaction between players. The cards depict the letters that spell the word 'murder' and when played each letter allows a certain action to be performed, which generally messes with one of your opponents e.g. they have to remove a card from in front of them, you take a card from their hand, they discard their hand etc. The first player to spell the word 'murder' in front of them is the winner. There's possibly too much emphasis on 'take that' in this game and I'd have preferred to have seen more actions that benefit yourself without affecting your opponents, which due to the amount of luck based on the cards you draw wouldn't have been a bad thing. On the plus side I really like the Gothic artwork and humour featured on the cards, and the way that 'MoC' doesn't take itself too seriously.

I like how every single card both adds to your MURDER goal and also plays an ability on other players, and how easily those abilities can be blocked. With enough players, it tends to devolve into everyone screwing the lead player, so it can start to drag on, but I've had some good fun with it.

Interesting set collecting game except you are just collecting one set that spells MURDER. Each card has a power so for example when you play a R you draw another card, the D makes everyone discard. These actions can be stopped by crows (on each card and wild cards). It works well and we played through the deck 2+ times. It is quick.

Excellent warm up card game. Managed to stretch to 6 players with it, but did extend the time play by about 10 minutes because of this.

It uses the ability to stack letters and to wipe columns but in matches with more than 3 people the opportunity to use this effectively is low.

Personally best played with 3-4 people at most. 2 Player is viable but quite boring.

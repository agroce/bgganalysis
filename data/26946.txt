Outstanding variant. The ladies and babies offer a tremendous "screw you" opportunity --  nothing quite like passing a baby to an opponent who must then burn a loooong field. (Secrecy rules must be strictly enforced.) The most interesting dynamic is that information then becomes as valuable as cards; it is better to take one of the two face-up cards for trade than to take an unknown card from another player. UPDATE: Still fun! I don't know why this gets such harsh reviews here.

This is NOT an expansion for Bohnanza, but a standalone game. It uses all the beans from the original Bohnanza (from Garden to Blue), but what is so great about this game is that some of the cards are women and babies. What's great about that, you might ask? Well, they have different bean-o-meters than the ordinary male beans; the women have much better bean-o-meters, and the babies give you 0 money for harvesting them - but they let a woman lying underneath your field advance two spaces forwards! Also, it's not allowed to say what type of bean (man, woman, baby) you want to trade in your hand, so nobody can ever be certain if they are going to receive a baby or not, and that adds an interesting and intense layer to the game. 
It's not better than Bohnanza, but it certainly isn't worse either - it's just different, and it's absolutely a lot of fun.

Más mint az eredeti játék, de annyival nem, hogy mind a kettőt beszerezzétek. Ez viccesebb és agyalósabb, de valamiért az eredetit mi jobban szeretjük.

Great variation of the classic Bohnanza. I like it but not than much the original.

I have the Rio Grande Games edition that contains this and Al Cabohne.

This is the first variation of Bohnanza that I think is better than the original game, and only the second one that I think I'll come back and play once in a while. (Al Cabohne being the other one)

Really really loved the new strategies introduced in this version!  Much deeper with still the same level of fun as the original.  With the right crowd I may pick this over the original although the original will still rate higher for me as it's more likely to get played.

This game adds a nice twist to Bohnanza.  I would not say I enjoy it more than the base game, but it does provide an interesting and fun variation.

The Queen of crappy deal making. even better because this one includes a "screw you" factor. I can assure you no one will trade you a blue bean if you have a stack of 9 blue beans with a baby on top, making your whole field worthless until you get another blue bean!

Something for Bohnanza fans to try. One of the better Bohnanza versions, but not quite as good as the original.

Indifferent.

Bohnanza with a twist – and a neat, tactical twist to boot. What's not to like?

The bohnladies and bohnbabies look darn endearing, too (lots of "oohs" and "awws" from my daughter). They even add some unobtrusive narrative depth to the illustrations, turning the bohndudes from cheeky caricatures into real characters!

22-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Typical Bohnanza is a fun bean trading game. In it, you basically grow bean fields, that can only have the same beans. The more you have, the more money you get :). Some beans are worth 0 if you have less than a certain number.

The constraints are, you can never change the order of the cards in your hand. Each turn you have to plant the first bean from your hand (but may play up to two) and if you already have it on the field, that's great. If you don't have it on your field, you have to sell an existing 2+ card field, unless you have two fields with just one bean (you can then choose). Then, you flip two cards from the deck which you can plant, or trade.  

Ladybohn basically is bohnanza but adds an interesting twist to vanilla Bohnanza. You can get 'screwed' by baby-beans that reduce the value of your field to 0, or ladybeans, that are worth more than their male couterparts, but also may be moved upwards in case a babybean is added to the field. 

Actually, this expansion was not at all displeasing.. but like regular Bohnanza it should have rules for negotiations in order to trim the time down and people get suspicious for the baby-beans.

Played ones. When playing Bohnanza, we usually stick with the basic game. Somtime we include High bone. We never get to play Ladybohn, sadly.

The ladies and babies add an interesting twist to the game, but I'm not sure if this is really that good/necessary, considering the simple enjoyability of the basegame. It's definitely worth a try however, especially if you're a Bohnanza fan.

Yes, it truly is an infusion of [thing=4377]Ladybohn[/thing] into [thing=11]Bohnanza[/thing], with babies thrown into the mix.  The babies are brutal, however, if they get on top of your field when they can't pull a lady to the top.

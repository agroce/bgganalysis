Ah, the memories!  My foe's last ship was on fire and set to explode at the end of the round.  I was already warming up for the victory lap.  He had one shot left to resolve...and he hit my powder magazine on my last ship!  He experienced the joy of watching my ship blow to smithereens just before his burned to the waterline!  HE GOT TO DO THE VICTORY LAP, THE BASTARD!!!

The game that feels most similar to Ironclads is Tobruk, strangely enough. Fire combat is a three step process in both games: Did the shot hit its target? What part of the target was hit? What damage was done to the target? Ironclads is very evocative of the subject and can be exciting to play, but I have a problem with simultaneous pre-plotted movement. I just don't believe that the resultant "guessing contest" is the right approach to use in this type of game.

This is a great game of civil war Naval combat that screams for miniatures rules.  The map included with my edition of the game is really really bad.  I always have to draw up contour blockers for the scenario to make the playing area obvious.  Other than this really good game

RATING: 7
Even though I have minimal interest in the US Civil War I nonetheless enjoyed my first play of this tactical naval combat simulation. It was fun recreating river engagements between Union and Rebel ships, utilizing speed, manuever, river terrain, and different caliber guns to inflict various types of damage on my enemy!

Many have tried, but no one has matched Ironclads for Civil War naval combat. 

To whoever came up with the idea of "area movement" for the latest "Ironclads" pretender, I'd like to point out that that type of tactical combat was unsatisfying in Bismark '62. 51 years later, it isn't any better.

In roughly 1982, I bought this game at my local retailer, it was the last copy they had.  About six months later, I returned and bought the expansion too :-)
Having all combat done at the end of movement GREATLY simplifies the game compared to something like Star Fleet Battles, it's actually possible to FINISH an Ironclads game.

Good game.  Like WS&IM there is bookkeeping. Not totally sold on some of the firing mechanisms. This and Iron and Oak are about your only good choices for Civil War ship to ship combat.  Ironclads is more detailed and less abstract than Iron and Oak, but overall, I think I&O is a better gaming experience, especially with the C3i overlays. To each their own as both a worthy.

simple to play and great storytelling.  the less-than-perfectly designed ships and constrained terrain of a river battle spices up naval combat.

can be very slow to play due to the detailed shot resolution system.

includes expansion kit.

rating based mostly on the Yaquinto version.  I actually own the Excaliber version, and it is a pretty sad edition; no improvements from original, and still alot of errata with the ships.

miniatures:
1:1200 Confederate cottonclad
1:1200 USS Indianola
1:1200 USS Essex
1:1200 CSS Albermarle
1:1200 Union sidewheel steamers (2)

I own the Excalibre version.  I actually would have rated it higher, but the sideway views on the revised counters are a huge negative in my book.

Blast  to play, but can drag on if you have too many ships and guns. The Civil war scenarios are the best from a playability view. By tracking each hit you get a role playing aspect as cool narrative is created. Note that the guns are made over accurate to keep the games fun I believe (who wants to roll miss after miss after all) However if you pretend that each time a gun fires, it actually represents about 2-3 salvos the hit rate feels more accurate

I love this game, It's an older one to be sure.  Lot's of record keeping, secret movement and multiple dice rolls for a single shot. But it is worth it.  Even three on three you see the tension build and you engage.  I single luck shot can turn the game, or a good strategy can cut them off.  It isn't for everyone, but the feel, theme and variety of ships makes this an older and great classic.

A simply unique game covering an interesting and, at least for wargames, a much overlooked period in naval warfare.  Mini rules using cardboard, the results of a battle can be a lot of fun.  One battle resulted in a Union monitor with it's turret jammed one direction, a gun portal stuck shut, and it had run aground.  Great detail, great game!

This game is a great simulation, and a lot of fun as you get into piloting your ships around for the best firing position while dodging shoals and protecting the weak-points in your armor.  For the amount of detail (tons of charts and book-keeping of armor) it never seems to get bogged down in numerical details and keeping track of armor points is rather easy.

The problem I have with this game is the production quality.  The maps can be confusing with so many overlapping shores.   The rules have tons of typos.  And while there are lots of good solo or two-player scenarios, I wished there were more balanced 3 or 4 player scenarios (say having multiple players cooperate on one side), but its hard to find one where that 3rd or 4th player wouldn't be bored with a lesser boat.

The best Ironclads game out there... very unique. Great for the gamer who has an interest in this area.  Plays well with a good excitement level. Game is kinda like baseball, nothing much happening, some armor getting hammered, then Whammo, a nasty critical.  The expansion was great... adding many new ships, and the HAF class... very susceptible to the critical hit!  Yaquinto all the way.. had the Excalibre version.. sold it.

Managed to find a very cheap copy of the 2nd edition and the expansion on Amazon so had to snap them up.  Since then, I have read that the 2nd edition has a few issues; mostly that they made numerous mistakes in the rules.  Also, 2nd edition makes the design choice to show pictures of the ships from the side, rather than top down.  Most strange (IMHO anyway) is that they went from two hex long unit pieces, to one hex pieces. So, I will give it a good play through someday and see how it goes.

I own the Excalibre version. Like other gamers said, the counters could have been better, compared to the older (Yakinto) version.

It’s the definitive game on naval combat during the American Civil War. It might not be everyone’s taste, because of the book keeping and the high number of die rolls required! Personally, I love rolling for location, penetration and damage... When the number of guns firing is limited! 

The scenarios are not balanced, but it’s about history! Players can always configure their own scenarios if they want something more balanced.

A fine ultra-tactical wargame on naval actions of the period. Plays just like a miniatures game (could easily be played as a miniatures game, if one were so inclined). Detailed enough to engage the imagination, and there are lots of ships and scenarios.

Only problem (aside from some rules errata) is that there's a LOT of dice rolling and chart checking involved. Also plotted simultaneous movement and manual record keeping. You have to be willing to work at this game. But if you enjoy the work, it's fun!

I really like detailed tactical games where EVERY shot counts (or at least is rolled for).  Tremendous mystique that fills the historic gap between Wooden Ships & Iron Men and all the more modern 'radar-directed, shooting to the horizon' and 'targets-for-airplanes' naval games.

Played the Introductory Scenario (Victory Conditions are not clearly specified). Good Union shooting sunk the CSS Virgina II. Ships speeds seem a bit high for a pre-plotted simultaneous movement system. Armor/Hull/Crew losses are not likely to be critical, it is the (lucky) Floatation hits that probably decide most games. Still a great game.

2 more playing of the Intro Scenario both ended with crew depletion of the CSS Fredericksburg and the gun emplacement destroyed (for draws). After 4 playings we settled on the following VC: Rebel win - destroy the gun emplacement and get both ships off the map or sink the USS Onondaga, Union win - sink both Rebel ships without losing USS Onondaga, otherwise a draw. (Also 20 turn limit to assure the Confederates do something or lose.)

After playing the 1st scenario my opponent wanted to move on. The mismatch of pre-plotted movement and ship speeds paled next to the ease of Special Hits (a 6) at even very bad attack differentials. The USS Minnesota could expect 1-3 Special Hits each turn on the Virginia. Overall, he felt that damage accrued too fast, especially for wooden ships against ironclads.

Ironclads easily transforms to a miniatures game and works well at conventions in that format.  The rules generally assume that one player will command multiple ships, but we've found that one player per ship works best in terms of generating accidental collisions and general foul-ups (which WERE quite common during the period).

Ironclads and Command at Sea only are rated differently than all other 200+ other games*.  For the 200+ plus the rating comes from playing the game with and against a fellow gamer.  For Ironclads and Command at Sea, on whose subject matter I own any and every book I am aware of ever published and within my meager means to get, I get. 

*If I own a complete or most near complete collection of a series, I list only one game, hence the number owned of this list is less than actual.

This was probably the definitive simulation of naval combat during the American Civil War. Extremely detailed but it is very slow to play 'as a game'. Mainly the combat system, which has you looking up individual guns of different calibers, and then going to a series of tables to get a final result. 

The new 'Iron and Oak' game by GMT synthesized a lot of this information into a very playable combat system but then blew the whole tactical movement process.

Combining the movement of this game with the beautiful cards from 'Iron and Oak' maybe the game that I am looking forward to.

Had a lot of fun with this in my youth, playing with several friends. Now the record-keeping, and lack of players, make this game less attractive to me. I sold my Yaquinto copy years ago, and later picked up the execrable Excalibre reprint.

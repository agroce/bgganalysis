This is a lovely looking game with a truly marvelous theme. But that cover belies the thinky depth underneath. For me it's too much of a computational nightmare juxtaposed with cute graphics and design. So it's just this side of a miss for me.

Played it once so far. It was fairly good although the rules don't always make thematic sense. Mostly based on logic so if you like chess you'll probably appreciate it. On the other hand, why not just play chess?

RATING: 7.5
Help the 3 adventure to get back home, crossing the sea - by hopping from ice flow to ice flow. Pick up and use ropes and fishes to guide the adventure back home. Move, rotate or create an ice flow. Go fishing to get fishes. And beware of polar bears as you can only tempt them with fishes. Fail to do so, the adventurer gets airlifted back to square one.

It's all about trying to be quick and at the same time trying to screw pther players up. Play with a bunch of nice people, it shall be fine. With a bunch of serious gamers - prepare for lots of &%*#&*X&%

Ice Flow is a very very good game.  A transitional-type family game that will be played by both gamers as a light trek-across-the-ice and by families as a regular exploration.  Shades of Yspahan in target perhaps, though very different concept and mechanics. Hopefully at least as successful as Yspahan. Very attractive pieces especially the floes themselves.

Probably the most attractive game for release in 2008 - and it's got polar bears!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun puzzle-esque game of ice flow-hopping and polar bear meeples (also called "peeples").  There is a strong puzzle aspect.  Pretty reminiscent of an abstract, though the theme is well-connected with the game (sort of).  Gameplay is actually pretty fast, even with 4 players.  The time on the box is right.  Not too much screwage, though there is some (inevitably).

The big selling point is the pieces.  The wooden peeples, meeples and feeples (fish meeples) are exquisite.  The wooden rope bits are uninspiring.  The translucent hexes are simply awesome.

I'm glad I got this one.  I could use a puzzle game in my library and this one will work nicely.  Not too much of a brain burner, but still has a medium length.  The bits rock.

I recommend giving this one a shot.  No guarantees, and probably not incredibly amazing, but it's a solid game with sweet bits.

Gift (twice).
I do not think this is a good game for children. Pieces are cute but gameplay is quite complicated and the game is fiddly and can get quite long.  
For adult may be challenging but there are much better games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Is it an abstract?  Is it a cute abstract?  Sort of, though the rules are inelegant for an abstract, and the resource management/flow cards make it not feel quite like an abstract.  In general, it's too rules-heavy (with special cases etc.) for an abstract, but too abstract to be that fun.  Meh.

Another gripe:  thematically, polar bears should be BAD.  You should HATE them.  But they're more useful or harmless or "oops, I'd help them if I sent them the bear" than they are an attack method.  It doesn't need to be nasty, but come on -- you shouldn't be hoping to hit yourself with bears.

Race games get a bad rep.  For some reason, they are seen as not strategic or thought provoking.  This game is proof that race games can be quite cool (no pun intended).  Players have to work their racers across the ice while keeping supplies in mind.  The ice flows can help get you where you need to be or force you down a much longer path.  To win, you'll need to plan your actions and think several turns out.  Without care, you can find yourself stranded without much hope of success.  Worthy a serious look.  And the components are nice done too.

RATING: 6.5
Preliminary rating based upon one play.  Actually a fairly analytical game.  I can see using this to teach kids logical thinking/problem solving.  May be too dry or too random for some people, especially with 4 players.  Because of the problem solving/optimizing nature, you aren't going to get the raucous laughter that you get with other games.

Also may be to tactical for some as with more players the board can change quite a bit in between plays.

Rating may go up with more plays.

RATING: 4
The bits are lovely - especially the ice floes & polar bears.  And the first half of the game is really good.  But then the resources start to disappear,  and progress slows to a crawl.  And by the end I don't care who wins,  just anyone to finish the tedium.  I was actually going backwards,  trying to get the occasional resource near the start,  prior to making another foray forward.  I'm sure there's a decent game in here somewhere,  but not as the rules currently stand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Some tactical decisions to be made in jumping accross the Bering Strait ice floes from from Alaska to Siberia.  Don't forget your rope can bechanged into fish.  Can lead to some AP, but is not a long game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It starts out to look like an excelent game, but it's an ok game.
Has a very puzzle aspect to it, of managing your resources (fish and rope) whilst trying to stay ahead of other players. You really have to think very well how to use the available resources the best way possible while not letting your opponents benefit much from your actions.
Great components though and adds to the score given. Needs more plays.

Well, the pieces are quite beautiful, and thematically this is quite nice.  Unfortunately, the game itself isn't really all that compelling; it lacks a certain "wow" factor for me.  Swimming is a bit overpowered, and really helps trivialize a lot of the decisions in this game I find.

Very cool components here, optical a hit.
This game is really nice interactive, but this is also the problem of this game. Every move has to be planned carefully, especially because you can help other players or mess with them. This drags the game down to analysis/paralysis. This is a quite game, where everybody is focused on the game. Also you can`t much pre-plan, as a lot depends on the move of the other players.
I have the feeling this game is a better 2 player game. But it`s not a familiy game! Is a deep eurogame.
This game should have 2 kind of rule set, as in Agricola. One with a lighter, not so brain-burning gamefolw, one as it is, as the strategic variant.
But in the end it is a solid game.

Puzzly racing game where you're trying to get your dudes across an ocean via drifting and spinning chunks of ice, all while avoiding polar bears and managing an inventory of fish and rope to speed your way across.  The game can be a little nasty as you try to make things easy for your dudes, while shafting other players' dudes.  Overall, a solid game that was alright but didn't get me all that excited either.

Great international race title based on actual events (which are increasingly impossible to recreate due to lack of ice - polar bears are even hungrier now though and I suppose it would be possible to make robo-seals "fish" to lure them away or drones to harass them away.) Amazing adventure meeples.

Customization ideas: paint "rope" with bright dots to suggest actual synthetic climbing rope. Repaint fish to northern Pacific fish color (grey-silver from brown.)

It's a very puzzley game.  You have to work out how to get from A to B by moving your pieces, moving the board (ice floes themselves), avoiding obstacles (polar bears) and managing resources necessary to overcome the hindrances in the way.

[April 2015 - 6.5]
Fun little game that doesn't take long, and it works the brain some. As many have noted, it's kind of a puzzle game trying to figure out the right combinations to get your explorers across the board. There's the possibility for interaction in moving other player's ice flows (against their favor) and sending polar bears after them, but both aren't necessary if you're playing a friendly match. Love the components and its great to look at. Is it better than some other quick and easy games of this type and level? "Survive: Escape from Atlantis" is better, although a little longer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A very clever racing game across the Bering strait.  It looks pretty but it definitely isn't as light as either its appearance or the box (branding it as a family game) suggests.  This can be brainburner, however, due to its theme, it seems to be very accessible even to people new to boardgaming.

Players race to be the first to get their team of three explorers across the Bering Strait, from Alaska to Siberia.  Fun, and very interesting game, where players take turns manipulating the ice floes and trying to move their explorers across them.  The floes are constantly on the move, so the board is very dynamic.  Players require both rope (to catch fish, or climb ice walls) and fish (to gain energy for swimming, or distracting polar bears) to increase their movement options.  Quick turns, but deep game play.  Wonderful pieces too - the ice floes are remarkable.  Top effort.

This is the kind of game that is Spiele des Jahres material: wonderful components, strong theme, easy to learn and play, suitable for families, and yet satisfying also as a lighter game for gamers.  It has a puzzle like quality, but it is a good family game as players try to be the first to cross the Bering strait on ice floes from Alaska to Siberia, using rope and fish, and dodging polar bears.  Theme is based on an endurance feat by a real explorer.  

Note change in revised rules: ice floes are setup before placing explorers.  Also for a quicker game (especially with 4 players), use 2 explorers each instead of 3.

Nice quick little game that is deadly if your explorers run out of resources.

Careful placing of ice floes can result in your explorer being able to run across the ice... if someone else doesn't spot it and stop you.

Polar bears lack a little something as you aren't really afraid of them.

I was really excited about this one. The components looked excellent & the game play seemed like it may be similar to an older game we have called Survive!. But, they are actually very different games. Ice Flow is kind of heavy on the strategy, and will take a few rounds to truly get the hang of. I do enjoy this game quite a bit, but it is a bit heavier than I expected.

RATING: 5.5
played with 4.  The game dragged.  Some suggested it might be better with only 2 players.  I think when players like to be able to carry out plans and strategies, then they are unhappy when everyone can change the board dramatically, so that when the player's turn comes again, the board is so different, all of their strategy and planning is for naught.  I am not sure I agree--I think it is probably more interesting with more players. It would simply be a different game, played differently, with different numbers of players.

Players control teams of adventurers racing across the Bearing Strait by manipulating the flow of the ice (hence the name), gathering resources (fish/rope), and effectively navigating across the body of water.  Decisions are meaningful, and one must be aware of both present and future turn possibilities as leaving a solo adventurer without resources can really slow your momentum.  The addition of the possibility that bear pong can occur make this a fun game.  The time/weight ratio is very balanced on this one, as Ice Flow will end long before it out stays it's welcome.  AP is possible, but not exhaustingly so.  Ice Flow also does an incredible job of adhering it's theme to it's mechanics.

UPDATE:  My second playing of this has convinced me this is a great game. Possibly better with three than four.  The second outing had multiple polar bears compared to the first game, and in turn made the experience much more thought provoking and interactive.  This led to some hysterical and clever play.  A great game.

My head hurts - how do I cross the ice? What goods do I need? Where will the polar bear bounce to - oh no! It's back with me - I'm being airlifted back to base!

This game is great with great components (I love the plastic ice flows and the wooden polar bears!) But it always takes us ages and we get stuck with strategy quite a lot!

A great looking game with fantastic bits that's an absolute blast to play. A very fun and well done game that I will play anytime. It has just a touch of the screw your neighbor element which adds to the game, so long as everyone doesn't group up on you. Unless you are the leader of course then it's to be expected.

Reminds me a bit of Niagara (floating meeples) and a bit of Hey, that's my fish (jumping on ice). Not that good as these two but fun nonetheless. A bit too complicated for what it offers and can drag when played with nasty opponents.

I like it and won't refuse to play it but that's all.

A light-hearted abstract vaguely reminiscent of the old classic Escape from Atlantis.

Would be good for families with older children, but there's a high chaos factor at work, so some kingmaking may creep in with more play.

I love the components on this one--specifically, the little plastic ice hexes with the cracks.  They are nifty and unique and also interesting in terms of the game play.

The game itself is mostly a puzzle game, maybe with a little bit of screw-your-opponents.  It's a decent filler if you like that sort of thing.

I was bothered by how the name looked like a misspelling, but the designer was very nice and sent me a new cover :)  Thanks, Dean Conrad! (1 play)

I enjoyed this game.  Each turn is solving a puzzle about how to best advance your explorers.  The game plays tactically because, while some advanced planning is possible, very often intervening players will make moves either intentionally or inadvertently that cause you to have to re-think everything.  Thus, the game can be prone to some Analysis Paralysis.   The components are nice, and the ice flow pieces are unique ... although, the price seems high for so few components.  The box is pretty empty.  The game could easily fit in a box 1/2 the size if the board folded further.

This is almost broken.  With veteran players it takes foreeeeeever to finish..  When a player is close to winning all others gang up on him and ruin his plans.  Then the next player is close to winning and the same story goes again...  And so on and on and on...  Extremely boring.  If nobody makes a mistake it can happen you can play even a few hours...  At the end you just beg: 'Anybody, please finish...this...torture...'.

Besides all of that I don't like the design at all (randomness and other issues).  Forced game for me - just if someone thought 'I want to make a game about travelling through Bering Strait on ice' and he made it.  No matter what.

Looks extremely good, but it's long, random, last player is in significantly worse position with no balancing mechanizm, the way the theme is pasted on it is plain stupid (eat a fish and you can swim in arctic sea like a superman, whenever you use a rope you have to leave it behind, but you can go fishing with the same rope and loose it too).

RATING: 9.5
My University gaming group played a late prototype of this game and, to a person, was very impressed. Most notable was the simplicity and ease of play coupled with the depth of play. Whilst this can lead to over-analysis by 'gamers', it also offers potential for a quick, fun end-of-the-session game.

I have now seen the published version, which does not disappoint. The components are very classy; especial mention should go to the plastic ice floe tiles. If I were to offer a whinge, it would be the size of the board and bits. I like big, chunky pieces, but I have big, chunky fingers, so this is a minor, subjective criticism!

Game play has tightened since the prototype. Balance in a 4 player game is excellent and it now scales very well for 2 to 4 players. The result is an impressive family / gamer's game. I can't give it 10 (because it is not Chess or Go), but I have no hestitation in lifting my initial grade by 0.5

---------
Previous comments:
I took the opportunity to play the prototype version at Spiel 2007 in Essen with the designer, Dean Conrad. I am very glad that I did.

This is not fully a traditional 'Euro-style' game; nor does it necessarily aim to be, but do not dismiss this merely as a family game either. With a board comprising a hexagon field of 70 or so spaces covered by 30 moving ice floe pieces of varying designs (in a very nice translucent ice-blue plastic), the Ice Flow board offers millions of configurations, creating the choices and dilemmas which make Euro-games so compelling. Added to this is a pleasingly logical rule set, objects with multiple uses, a good deal of player interaction, and a simple move-explorer / move-ice dynamic that keeps the game driving forwards.

I played 2, 3, and 4 player games. Whilst the game scales well, it has to be said that the 3-player played marginally better than the other two. However, I am conscious of the fact that testing a prototype at Essen cannot compare with a rigorous home-group 'thrashing'. Moreover, I know that Dean is adding internal modifications to the game to bring both the two-player and the four-player in line with the three-player, that is: the right degree of race and chaos.

My rating here (9) reflects both the game's clear potential and my eagerness to own and to play the published version.

It's an interesting race/logistical game.  I am trying to decide whether the "parasitical" strategies that seem to emerge in the game bother me or not.  Seems like it is often optimal to follow/use the path another player has spent actions setting up for themselves and then burst ahead.

RATING: 7
I'll play this definitely only when in the right mood. It seems, on first glance, to be a very simple race game. Get your team to the finish before everyone else? Yes, but how you do it can lead to a lot of working out and looking ahead. Our first ever five or six turns took about 20 minutes for each turn (in a three-player game). It quickened up a bit towards the middle, and I think is not just because we became more familiar with what to do but also because as more ice is on the board and starts to back-up there's a different feel between start-game and mid-game, and the wide-open plans at the start become more focused as some paths become more favourable and others less so.

This is a beautiful and solid racing game in which you seek to get your three explorers to Russia before everyone else.  Polar bears, fish, ropes, ice floes, water all get in the way or can be used to devise a speedy path across the strait.  It is very simple and straightforward to play as you move an ice floe (mandatory) and have an option to move one of your explorers. Sounds simple but ice floes, water currents, and polar bears as well as your less than helpful opponents can wreak havoc on your best laid plans.

3 things to remember in this game 1) leave that rope behind (my nomination for easiest rule of the year to forget and most often heard phrase around the games table), 2) if you consume fish you are able to swim and 3) ice flows rarely ever flow.

Would like to play again as I am confident rating would go up but, ignore the weak pun, its cold reception by others mean this is probably unlikely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
UPDATE: After reading the rules, the game is based on a real life trek of a person who is (don't think it happened yet) planning on crossing the Bering Sea ice flow to ice flow...

OK - the premise is dumb - sort of a reverse migration to Asia absent a land bridge. (And it gets worse).

The board and bits are very nice except the stick for a rope (needed to cross rough sided Ice Floes). Ludorum's site showed other ideas including a coil of what actually looked like rope.

Game play is straightforward - and even younger ones could play - but there is a lot of strategy involved.

Rating based on one play and might move either way. 

EDIT: revised rating after a few more plays...

This IS a cool looking game! Love those blue-see-thru ice hexes. The bears (beaples?) are great too. In fact: the whole game looks very good. It's a very clear design that might make you think it's a simple kids game.

Don't be fooled: this is a good strategical game that might be the right "next step up" after lighter fare as Ticket to ride for newbies.

Very enjoyable, both for family as for gamers.

Great looking game where players are trying to get across the Bering Straight by traveling over ice floes and gathering fish and rope to help them on their journey.  It's quite abstract-feeling in that it has point to point movement, you move tiles, turn tiles and try to give your opponents a bad lead, when you can.  The game plays much slower than I expected.

Enjoyable but I could see if the other players teamed up against you to send the polar bear at you it could be frustrating.  Nice thing is I think you could strategically place yourself in positions where this would be difficult, although I'm sure that would slow your journey.

Attractive production, especially the charming board and beautiful ice pieces. But the game, hmm, a bit dull. Maybe if the polar bears were more of a factor. Or if the ice flowed more readily or with more variety. Theme-wise, what's up with your explorers in three different locations playing out of the same knapsack? And taking frigid dips without repercussions? [2 plays]

Clever little game, great bits (polar bear Meeples!) and lots of chances to screw your neighbor.  Good times all around.  Evokes Survive! for me, but different enough to be its own game.

After having this game sit for quite some time I finally played it two player with my wife and we enjoyed it.  Object of the game is to get your playing pieces across the Bering Strait that is infested with Ice packs, Polar bears, fish, and rope.

A brain-busting puzzle game, essentially.  Being able to envision what something will look like after several possible turns in your head is a skill that will serve you well here.  If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then at least play once so you can have fun with the Meeple Polar Bear (Molar Bear? Bearple?  I don't know what the correct term is exactly).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Lovely bits, but a somehow sterile gameplay that doesn't really work until you get really geared up into screw-the-leader mentality. Even then, the game tends to fizzle towards the end just when you are expecting it to build to a climax.

RATING: 7
This is deeper and more interesting than it looks - feels like a mashup of RoboRally (moving elements) and Lost Valley (variable actions). I am very impressed with the plastic "ice flow" components from Litko.
The rules are relatively simple, almost intuitive. They are certainly easy to teach and simple to learn. The game has a lot to think about, however, and some turns took quite a while. This was due to players making genuinely complex decisions. It isn't Chess or Go, but Ice Flow needs time for thought. It isn't the right game for casual play, despite appearances.
The game looks inviting and attractive. Ice Flow seems to be a very good game for attracting players to more complex fare; not a gateway game, but a stepping stone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A clever game that's great to play on Snow days. It is a good medium weight game that is the right length for a week night. The components are really nice, plastic cracked ice flows, game bag, meeples, polar bears and fish. The artwork is unusual but I really like it. 

On a players turn they try to maneuver across the ice flows that move across the ocean (crossing from Alaska to Siberia). To move you need rope and fish. Fish to eat and to ward off polar bears. Rope to climb across ice flows. An easy game to learn, relearn and teach to others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent race game, but even though the theme is nice, the moves are too abstract in nature to really draw you in. The winner is the first to race three guys over the Bering Strait, jumping from ice flow to ice flow. Each turn you can both manipulate the ice flows and then move a dude, in either order. The manipulation can be moving them along the current (and generally jumping on or off them Frogger style to get you along) or rotating them (in order to move over clean edges, as you require rope to move over jagged edges). Sometimes the easiest way to move is just to discard a fish and swim over a vacant hex to the next ice flow, but the fish tend to disappear pretty quickly (until people bring on new ice flows instead of moving or rotating them). So you have a game of trying to set up clean moves that travel a fair distance without too much cost ... but without setting up your opponents to take a similar advantage. You can do some clever things - you have a fair number of options to work through, taking into account what other people are likely to do on their turn as well, and you need to be alert for the opportunity to do pus moves. Moves are thinky but without being overly long ... it has an abstract feel. There's not a lot of tension or story. Your reward is to see and then pull off good moves and hope people are too busy doing their own things so as not to interfere. The components and artwork are nice and will help get the game back to the table, but probably only for the occasional play.

Ice flow does not play well with two players, there is not a lot going on and an abundance of resources everywhere for. Also, while I think you can play this game with a lot of planning ahead and cunning moves you do not have to and while this makes it a nice family game, it is the more underwhelming as a game for eurogamers. I like the bits and bobs and when reading the instructions, the game sounds somewhat exciting but it does not really come together well, at least not in a 2 player game.

The upside:
- Those plastic floes
- Humurous approach with all that fish throwing and no dying from bear attacks.
- The levels and means of interaction between the "racers".

The downside:
- You need to find the right players for this game.
- AP prone.

It feels like the classics I enjoyed as a child while rewarding good tactical decisions. You might expect a fairly random game with this kind of setup, but I surprised by the amount of control players had over the flow of ice and movement of the polar bears.
I should also note that the box really doesn't do this game justice. The components are just great. A blast to fool around with.
Overall: It feels like a classic but also so unique. There's nothing amazing about the game, but it's definitely humorous and extremely entertaining. Great for the young and the young at heart.

Like Hey That's My Fish and Shear Panic, this is another abstract with funky components, dressed up as a Euro. It's decent, but I think the random event cards detract a little from the abstract core of the game. The ice floe movement / rotation is really clever, and the initial floe setup should lead to a lot of different openings to try out. It's not much fun to actually play, though, which is a shame.

Another terrific family game with cute pieces and lovely production values (the ice floes are a work of art.)  I would worry that the lightness of feel will be lost as gamers do tend towards AP when there is the chance to do so, making downtime a bigger issue.  That's a terribly minor complaint though; this is the sort of game that should be an SdJ contender.

Yes, it has very nice components, but I couldn't help feeling that it went on for too long.
I would suggest that another 2/3 games will give a better indication.

Anticipated this greatly, but it fell flat. A lot of unsatisfying, almost routine monotonous decisions instead of long-term strategy. The game lasts way, way, way too long (especially 4-player). It's fun for the first 30 minutes, but the game lasts 60-90 minutes, and past the first 40, the excitement of the theme wears off, and you're left with an inelegant spatial abstract. This would have been a great game if the game board were smaller, making the game shorter and tighter. Great idea, flawed execution. Absolutely terrible with 4, (polar-)bearable with 3, and I'll have to try it with 2, which I am optimistic about.

I didn't like the "community wormhole backpack," but the rest of the game was pretty good. We played in with a new gamer and worked well as a gateway game. Kids would probably like this one too. I suppose you could attempt to play the game backwards from Russia to the United States and with three seperate backpacks, but the second change might really alter the game as you won't be able to "teleport" equipment forward to token markers near poplar bears, etc. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Innovative ideas and beautiful components, but game play is dull. During play we had many questions which weren't addressed by the rulebook, so it seems like many things were dropped to create a short manual. Players have to work together to not let the starting player win. Winning may be arbitrary (at the whim of the other players), as is sadly evident with many other eurogames, too. The polar bears are nice, but they should be nastier.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love the concept of families of Communist loyalist spies running back to Russia.  The first family to get back lives the rest executed.

Fine little racing game with some nice ideas.  It is quite a bit slower and longer than I expected.  It is solid, but it fails to wow.  There is little danger in the game, and the board tends to get caught up in a quagmire, with too few resources.  It would be nice if ice would push other ice.

One of the least exciting things is waiting for the winner to finally win, either because it is a forgone conclusion or because everyone is ganging up on him.  It is also entirely possible to be caught flat footed with no resources and no way to get them.  This can lead to a long protracted last place finish. 

While all the bits are lovely, I find the iceflows a little difficult to read.  The cracked sides are tough to sort out against the board design especially from across a table especially when the ice is loaded with goods.
 
Still, the design is nice.  It is the kind of game that you appreciate someone else buying in your group.

Ultimately, despite the worthwhile design, it doesn't have a whole lot of fun in it.  Certainly, nothing compared to the wonky, but highly entertaining, Polar Dare.

My initial reaction is that it is reasonably fun, but nothing too special overall.  I enjoyed it, and I'd play a quick game of it again sometime, but I'm not itching to do so anytime soon.  Has somewhat interesting choices, great bits, and a very clean, easy to use game system.  No stupid exceptions and rules that don't make sense screwing up the joint.  Just a solid, simple game that is maybe missing something to push it over the top into being exceptionally good.

RATING: 6.5
[Heidelberger Spieleverlag 08 edition] {Adventure; Unit-movement, card; optimal 4p} Ice flow is a well produced family game.  It is thematic and interactive. The rule is a little bit fiddly and it takes a while to explain all rules; luckily the game provides useful player aids.  A minor problem is that it can run long in 4p game, esp. with slow players.  It can be brutal because players can intentionally move away ice floes someone needs, or use the Polar Bear to bash another player.  But, the Polar Bear is fun!  It is a little pricey, when compared to other family games.  It is more like a step-up family game, because players have to make good planning in order to win, and that's quite unforgiving.

Ice Flow has very nice components.  The Ice flow tiles are special and nicely crafted.  The wooden pawns are cute.  The board is well illustrated.  I can't complain on the components.  The box is horribly large.

I'd overlooked this at the UK Games Expo. It seemed something of a family game, but I was mistaken. A good race game where you aim to be the first to get your three explorers across the shifting ice floes. The combination of explorer movement (possibly requiring fish/rope to swim or navigate crevices) and ice floe rotation & drift make for some interesting decisions.

This one didn't really grab me right away.  I see the point, and why it has some appeal from some players, but it's blah.  I'm not actively seeking out ever playing this again, though I could probably be talked into it if someone else really wanted to play.

Reminded me of Chinese Checkers actually. I liked the little backpacks with item limits; a lot like Lost Valley. Fish seemed overly impt - you need them to Swim, Deal with Polar Bears, etc.

Probably because it was my first play, I was struggling to try to screw someone over with the Polar Bears. It seemed to be a "take the opportunity when it rises" sort of screwage. Nothing that you can really plan for unless you try very hard. 

Anyway, it's an okay game. Didn't really spark a "must own" for me, but I wouldn't mind playing again.

Oh how I want to like this, but it has not gone over well whenever I have brought it out.  I think I am trying it on the wrong crowds.  It looks like a game for younger and/or non-gamer crowds, but it is really too thinky.

I just hesitate to reach for it now.  I think I'm just gun-shy and have to try it again.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1.25

Ice Flow has nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing particularly compelling about it. It involves a hexagonal board where players are attempting to be the first to move their explorers to the other side (from Alaska to Russia, although I’m not quite sure why they're fleeing Alaska). To cross the Bering Strait, you’ve got to hop your explorers along the titular ice flows, which are liable to move along the flowing currents and some of which come bearing polar bears. Thankfully the polar bears have short attention spans and are easily distracted by spending one fish token, which are gathered on other ice flows. The last resource to collect and spend in the game is rope, which is needed to cross between ice flows which have broken edges, like in this picture: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/337980. The game works, but doesn’t really bring anything new to the table and consequently isn’t really engaging. It feels like a whole host of other spatial positioning games on hexagonal grids (e.g., Hey That’s My Fish, Through the Desert) without really being very much like any of those games, but also without having the same elegant simplicity of those games, given the frills that have been included to make the game more family friendly. I’d willingly play it again, but am not dying to by any means.

Got to play a couple of times at Origins 2008 and am glad my gaming buddy picked it up for more plays to come.  Game is easy to learn with only 2 action steps and only 2 or 3 options on each step, but has lots of strategy and is just plain fun!  Can't wait to get more plays!

Ice Flow is a strategic family game, interesting enough for gamers, as there are many tactical decisions to make.

Players race their explorers across the Bering Strait from Alaska to Siberia - riding ice floes, dodging polar bears, and collecting useful items on the way. The winner is the first player to arrive in Siberia with his three explorers intact.

Another bargain pick up at The Works (£7.99!) and what a little hidden gem of a game. Pretty light, but some interesting and very thematic rules (though why throwing a fish in the sea helps you swim across it is a little beyond me). The components are just awesome - the Litko acrylic ice floe markers alone are just beautiful. The game is pretty simple to pick up and plays in about an hour. Though it can suffer a little from AP, it is also a good game for getting screwed over after careful planning so that's a good way to warn new players at the start i.e. "Don't think too far ahead because by the time you get back to your turn, that ice floe might not be there" Nice mix of stupid fun (hurling polar bears at each other and tempting others away with a fish is joyous) and it features one of the best selections of first player I've seen in a long time. PLease please pardon the pun, but this game is a great icebreaker entry/medium strategy game.

Our first game we clearly focused too much on existing ice floes, and not enough on introducing new ones.  A pretty clever little game, and one which may bridge the generation gap quite well.  But not my style.

Got the game explained to me at Essen by one of the (very sympathetic) designers of the game, John Streets (who was also kind enough to sign my copy). The comic style artwork and beautiful components belie the amount of rules involved, but during my first two player game everything fell into place quite quickly. The game plays pretty fast even though there are quite a lot of options during an average turn. It might, however, work best with only two players: With more it can become quite chaotic, and can easily end in a kingmaker situation. Slowing down other explorers is as important to victory as moving your own.
UPDATE: After a couple more plays, I am still not sure how to win this game. It requires a way of thinking not often seen in boardgames. But that might actually be a good thing.

Great game and totally different from anything I've played before. The first time I opened it we played 3 2-player games back to back and I was up for another go!

Simple rules and short playing time. Somehow manoeuvring your pieces around the board and getting them 'home safe' is so satisfying. You need to think about it, but it's not a real brain burner - or maybe the fact that the components are so cute stops you from taking it all too seriously?! Whatever, it works!

(11/07 After 1 2p game)  Got a chance to try the nearly completed prototype at the 2007 ChiTAG.  I enjoyed the iceflow and iceflow piece rotation mechanic, felt unique to me.  Would make a good family or gateway game.  Will check it out again once it's pulished.

A 45-60 minute game of trying to race your little dudes across the Bering Straight before the other players. The few mechanics here fit together well to create a fun game of spatial planning in the face of copious but generally mild screwage. Recommended.

This is one sweet game! I rarely enjoy a game as quickly as I did this one- it struck me as fun the moment I read about it months ago, and when I got it and played a game I could not help but think of it as one of my new all-time favorites.  It has just enough going on for the game to be interesting, but not too much to make it crazy. Fantastic pieces - even a plastic lover like me likes the wooden bits in this one, especially since I also get those great blue plastic tiles!

Played it at Great Hall Games (Cisco's game). The theme is fun and the mechanics are interesting. I haven't played racing games such as this one much. The game seems simple, but it can involve a good amount of abstract thought.

Others thought this would be a nice game for non-gamers.

Very different and cool theme, and some great little meeples. Gameplay was good and it worked, but didn't feel as exciting as I expected, but that was during a 2 player game. I imagine a 4 player game would be a lot more exciting and strategic as the board will have changed much more before it gets back to your turn. 

Note that the game is very cut-throat and probably shouldn't be played with sore losers as you can really screw each other over!

I like James Marriot's comments enough to just repeat them here.  They hit the mark.

"This is not fully a traditional 'Euro-style' game; nor does it necessarily aim to be, but do not dismiss this merely as a family game either. With a board comprising a hexagon field of 70 or so spaces covered by 30 moving ice floe pieces of varying designs (in a very nice translucent ice-blue plastic), the Ice Flow board offers millions of configurations, creating the choices and dilemmas which make Euro-games so compelling. Added to this is a pleasingly logical rule set, objects with multiple uses, a good deal of player interaction, and a simple move-explorer / move-ice dynamic that keeps the game driving forwards."

This is a nice boardgame. Well, actually, it's not nice when it comes to bouncing off polar bears to your opponents and, especially, driving off your opponent's ice floes. Otherwise, it's a very playable game. And the contents are really great.

This racing game feels as if it is an odd abstract game. That feel may puzzle players at first due to how it doesn't feel like a fit for a race game. However, after only a few turns, players will begin to see how to chain moves, and quickly move across the Bering Strait.

The set-up is a bit too long, and fiddly for the quick and simple gameplay. It's a decent game, but nothing special apart from the great components.

It is true that there is more than what meets the eyes in terms of the gameplay, but with 2-player the experience was just not that exciting.  The passive polar bear pieces felt superfluous and doesn't seem to have much impact.  I don't consider Ice Flow a brain burner at all, more like a dull exercise in tile manipulation.  One strategy tip, never leave your explorers stranded with no resources what so ever, or else you'll be at the mercy of others.

After watching Scott Nicholson's video review of this game, I decided to give it a whirl.

I really like the light strategy involved with trying to get your whole team across the board before your opponent(s).  It is definitely a game not to take too seriously and it would make a great family/beer 'n pretzels choice.

The components are extremely well done and top quality.  I really feel like I got my money's worth with this one.  The clear blue ice floes and wooden tokens are durable for even younger players which is always a plus.

Surprisingly quick, light-medium weight, puzzley, strategic, race game. With experience you could get a meeple to the other side in 2 turns or maybe 1.

Low luck factor and plenty of screw your neighbour style gameplay tactics make for a clever race game.

I've played with groups who concentrate on getting the explorers across, and groups who move the ice floes off the board so fast the effect is like global warming. in both cases the game is still loads of fun!

This is a classic blind building game mixed with a bit of area control.  It would be all area-control except that the only way to place pieces in an area is to win the blind bid, hence the description.  There are multiple victory conditions and players are free to select which to pursue.  This option makes planning for others actions more challenging.  I suspect that one method is the predominant approach and the second method is seldom used effectively.  The components on the game are nice.  The game has a definite abstract feel to it in a very Colovini style.  The bidding can be brutal, so do not think the game has no direct confrontation or player action - both are quite high.  The constantly rotating next election site (as one is finished, another is revealed) mechanic is quite good.

Area control/blind bidding game. Good game. The board gets a little congested, but the play is fun and interesting. A real thinker.

RATING: 6.5
Area control games tend to attract mechanisms that are, well, predictable and plottable. That resolve through skilful manipulation of limited resources. Players tend to be naturally suspicious of mechanisms that seem to ride roughshod over the visible control part of "area control", and the simple mention of "blind bidding" will have many cube worshipping players running towards the exits.

A great designer, however, will come up with a subtlety, or two, that keeps blind bidding far removed from blind guessing. Doge surprised me. More than once. In a pleasant way. Except or the legally prescribed euro-game setting: Venice. At least Colovini has got a decent excuse to add yet another title to a shelf full of city of water and bridges, being born there and all.

From a design point of view, I kinda admire the technical flair. The addition of targetable top-up votes to a simple blind bidding mechanism is seamless, and since in Doge blind bidding produces only a small range of low values in a handful of places, gaining additional and decisive votes is crucial.

The game is split up in turns, and each turn has two phases, first vote allocation to the seven districts, and then, district by district, vote resolution.

If you win individual districts you will getting more houses to the board, and move them to the places where they are needed most, or before upgrading to palaces becomes costly. And since early districts create (potentially) top up votes for the person who takes the district, skilful allocation of these votes to districts that are still to be scored will creates a level of control that is surprising in a game where blind bidding is so central.

The drip-drip seeding of the board with (blind) votes means that people can make important strategy adjustments in this phase. Since it is important in which order districts are resolved, knowing the exact (random) sequence for each turn is crucial for planning purposes. But Colvini has gone one better: not only is this turn's sequence revealed by the start, but interestingly, after a district is scored in this turn, the next hidden district card in the sequence for the following turn is also revealed, giving players a lot of information about the game's progression, and making targeted and though-through use of the adviser's abilities even more decisive. And increasing replayability without lifting a finger. Add to that that as the game progresses, players actions can be anticipated reasonably well, and what you end up with is far more plottable strategy than you would have guessed from a quick skimming of the rules.

When I had read the rules, I also feared that placing 7 vote tiles each turn, in up to 7 fragmented steps, would become very repetitive, very quickly. However, what I hadn't quite anticipated, but became apparent pretty quickly, is how few turns this game is likely to have. And how much there is too consider at each point in the game, using very few ingredients. Maybe the rules are written a bit too woolly to highlight how the few, simple rules manage to weave a pretty thickly layered filler with oodles of tactical and strategic decisions. Which is a shame, as from a design point of view, it is a technical, tightly knit marvel, and one of Colovini's better designs for sure. Winners will have to outwit their opponents, blind guessing won't get you far.

I have long resigned myself to accepting that a Colovini game will probably appeal to me more as a delicate design, but less as an experience. This is no exception. I will happily play it again, and think hard about the game's curiosities can be used to outwit my fellow players. It is intriguing, and rewarding. Yet, it doesn't quite manage to shake off its rather abstract technical coat, impressive as it is. As a game it fails to grab me, and get my passion juices flowing. It deserves better.

My short intelligence made me be unable to plan nothing cunning the first time I played Doge, but I saw a good game that needs to be played more to squeeze all the juice it has.

I love early 2000's Colovini games. I'm so sad he doesn't have made a very good game in the last years.

*update*

Traded away after two plays, I really like this game but nowadays it feels a little old and there are tons of games in the same level that I prefer to play in my (each day less) gaming time so before make Doge stand unplayed a decade in my shelves I decided to trade it to another geek, maybe he gives Doge the love it deserves.

We liked it quite a bit.  There's a fair amount going on, with a nice 'rolling' revelation of the districts to be challenged and other aspects of the game which make it much more subtle than the blind bidding it may appear to be on first blush.  Not perfect but surprisingly good for an Adamspilet bargain buy.

Another one-idea game that desperately needed another idea. The one idea is not too bad, but there is really just not enough in the game (just allocate your influence each turn to a region, high influence gets points in a roundabout way) to justify its heft, cost, or time investment.

Another game about influence and power in Renaissance Italy. Players use a blind bidding mechanic to exert influence in selected provinces in Venice. If you win the bidding, you get to position houses, and enough houses earns you a big house. Get a big house in every province first, and you win! The crux of the game is using the advisors your win in influence bidding to influence further elections. A clever game, but it doesn't do anything for me. Not one I'd suggest.

Dry, derivative and repetative. For awhile it feels like there's more than blind bidding, but after the first half-hour you can't help but wish this game would be over. Instead you just keep placing blind bids over and over and over and over and over...

Surpisingly quick and with some nice ideas, Doge is a bit over-produced for what it is. The designs chosen for the regions could have been easier to read, and the whole set-up could have been tighter. But it is a curious game, part blind bidding, part control, part progessive building. What I liked best was that when multiple players build in a region, they do so at the same low price. This makes the price jump suddenly and encourages players to move houses elsewhere. The game did end faster than expected, but the choices are fairly simple and it plays quickly.

Doge combines area control and blind bidding into a game that resembles El Grande on the outside but plays rather differently. Like most Colovini titles it's a pretty dry affair (but no more so than the aforementioned El Grande, for example; and the theme does fit quite well) but it can get very tense especially towards the end. The outcome is almost completely determined by players actions, the only tiny element of randomness being the order in which the quarters are scored. The rest is up to your bidding and bluffing skills (or the lack thereof...). One of Colovini's best.

A clever area-majorities game that revolves around a stong blind bid and bluff mechanic.

Although this does involve blind-bidding, Doge plays and feels quite differently than Ys or Aladdin's Dragons.  There are fewer rounds of placing, and you are limited to where you can place for each election year.

This game can be brutal, which in itself isn't enough to make me dislike it.  But since there's a large guessing aspect, and you grow on the whim of others (if you go to an area that you don't think anyone else cares about, but they do, you can get a bit screwed.  Or maybe they just don't like you, or think you're winning.)  It doesn't hit the table with our group often, and that's ok with me.

RATING: 8
I have played a lot of Colovini games and this is probably the best one. Colovini tends to have a bit of abstract randomness in his games but this one is straight up strategy.

There are 7 regions and each year there is an election in each region. At the start of the year the players place their influence (round tokens valued 0,1,1,2,2,3,3) in at most 4 different regions. Each player chooses one regoin (via their set of region cards) and 1-4 token to place into the region, the cards are then revealed simultaneously and the tokens go into the region face down. This is done 4 times. Then the elections happen and the person who placed the most in a given region puts 2 houses there, second place puts 1 house. 

You can convert houses to palaces, the first palace to be built in a given region costs 3 houses, the next one 4 and so on. To win the game you need to have one palace in each of the 6 regions that allow palaces to be built, or 7 palaces in 5 regions, or 8 palaces in 4 regions. 

There's a bit more to the game, but I won't go into it here. I liked the game after one play, but now after 3 plays I really appreciate it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Doge manages to marry two of the most maligned mechanisms, area control and blind bidding, and form a decent game out of them. Seen from today, Colovini's design is from another era of gaming.

The functionality of the design is owed to a similar amount of bidding chips available to each player each round and consecutively revealed limited information allowing players to gauge what others are up to. What sounds arbitrary first, turns out to be a clever system when players repeatedly choose the same areas simultaneously. No random crapshoot.

While Doge can't avoid the usual problem of multiplayer games of hosing a player badly when a high invest is in vain, it features enough bids for odds to even out. The problem is that Doge is highly tactical and after one play no new discoveries will be made. Given its maligned mechanisms, it's unlikely that it will see enough further plays to make a judgment on the role luck plays in winning. 

Probably best played with three as players have more control. Good production value, specifically the consultants.

Good bluffing game, with lots of guessing and also some luck. Keeping the leader from winning at the endgame is not always an easy task. It allows a little planning and plays well in around 1 hour. Maybe it would be even better if it allowed 5 (maybe even 6) players.

only played once, so my impressions are incomplete ...
Mixed feelings.  Part of me wants to dismiss this as an utterly chaotic blind bidding/bluffing game marred by runaway leader syndrom.  But another part of me appreciates the elegantly simple "scoring" "track" and the partial information that mitigates the bluffing so it isn't totally blind.
Fun to use the "advisor hats" to inflate the apparent size of your bid.

To win a province (and place tokens to build for VPs), one places bid markers face down (value numbered from 0 to 3), up to 4 markers in one area. I&#039;m not fond of blind bidding games, like this one, Aladdin&#039;s Dragons or Die Weiss Lotus, since they are diffcult to play strategically (but of course some people love these games, but that&#039;s why they have menus in restaurants, so you can have a choice). There are some neat concepts, with cards turned up to see which province gets resolved first, so people can plan their advisor moves. The game as a whole is okay, but not something I want to play regularly.

Played this at Essen 2001, the day after playing San Marco.  Both games are about getting control of Venice, and we preferred San Marco.  The bidding mechanism is interesting, but it's possible to get completely screwed after the first couple of turns through no fault of your own.  Would have to play it again to confirm my initial thoughts

I tend to favor area control, but the bid mechanic offers an interesting twist.  The set is nice, and I just wish we'd play it more often.

RATING: 5
Unfortunately Doge left me a little cold. I liked the simultaneous reveal of tile placement, and the look-ahead on region scoring which allowed for some interesting placement strategy to get double use of the advisors. The blind placement of tiles wasn't as much a problem for me as I expected as the point spread is low (0 to 3), and there's the odd bluff of 3 tiles in for 1 point and 1 tile in for 3 points as you'd expect. But the smart play seemed to be not to worry too much about the bluffing - after all once your tiles were on, you can't add to them - so it seemed more appropriate just to shove your big guns into two regions you wanted to win, and maybe 1 tile in a third region to sneak a second place. Which made the game a bit clinical and one-dimensional for me. I can see there's scope for messing with people's minds, but you'll just as likely d'oh yourself.

I have more fun with Aladdin's Dragons as a blind bidding game, probably because you could get into bidding pissing contests which seemed more fun, as well as play with magic and stuff which seems more appropriately matched with a blind bidding mechanic in terms of luck. Plus there's more opportunity to get back into the game which seemed to be a problem in Doge - the game rewards the early winners with cheap palaces, so if you lose out on a few key bids early in the game, you'll be forced to buy more expensive palaces just to catch up whilst the early winners go on to target their next buildings which will be the same price as the ones you need to catch up.

RATING: 6
On rules reading.  This strikes me as better than the average Colovini game, but the repetitive nature of the blind bidding does not strike me as something that I would enjoy.  The map is lovely, though, to my view, despite its blandness.  But I like San Marco and Canal Grande, so I think that I have enough with this theme.  Traded.

At first the game appears to be something in the EL Grande family. However, the continous blind bidding just does not belong in this type of game.  It is not a matter of choices; it is a matter of guessing and that ruins the game.

I've never minded blind bidding, and with this one you have at least some idea of what's there--or not there. Doesn't really feel like a Colovini--whatever that means--but I like it. Hard to come from behind, though, as the price for things keeps ramping up.

Well, the box is pretty.  Ok, this is by no means terrible, rather just random and and not very engaging.  This game relies on timing from randomly drawn cards and blind bidding for control of "elections".  You can't fault this game for being well balanced, but you can fault it as it forgot to infuse any exitement into the package.

A neat little game of influence placement.  It has wooden versions of the houses and hotels from Monopoly, though of course they're called something else; exactly what I can't quite recall off the top of my head, which is indicative of the strength of theme here.  Nothing groundbreaking, but I enjoyed it, and could well play it again (as part of Venice night, with Venezia, San Marco, and maybe Serenissima?)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A so-so area-control game that is fun as a change of pace.  I prefer China/Web of Power for this style of game, and San Marco is far superior.  The blind bidding is interesting, but I wouldn't say that this is an amazing game, although for area control fans, this is good to get on the table once in a while.

UPDATE: Moving this down to a 5, since this really is a mediocre game for me.

Too long for such a dry game where you're performing the same actions repeatedly.  There is some strategy, mostly in a "I know what you're thinking so I'll react accordingly" type of way.  It seems almost by its nature that every game will end up being close.  Takes too long for what it is.

Hasn't gotten great reviews, but I kinda like this one ... but then I often enjoy blind bidding games when done right, while many folks just hate blind bidding, period. Update: As I try to pare down my collection in 2011, Doge is going on my trade pile. The decision wasn't easy, though, as Doge hasn't aged badly. I love how quickly it plays, and the bits are quite nice. But it does feel like Doge needs an extra step, mechanic or player option. While the blind bidding keeps the game simple and moving quickly, that's pretty much all players do, making Doge a game that has too little - but just barely - replay value to stay in my collection.

I like this game. It's blind bidding and area control. I used to think that I didn't like either of these two mechanisms but they are growing on me. It is also a neat turn order mechanism like Wallenstein/Shogun and there is a bit of tension with either making use of the advisor or moving a house.

I think the gameplay is fun but Colovini's style shows through. Nice chunky pieces and I enjoy that very much. I am thinking that this is very similar to Ys but Ys is partial blind-bidding which makes that game more prone to careful analysis. This is quicker than that game though. I will play again.

This game surprised me.  At first, I was annoyed with the initial placement to the board being completely random, with the potential for a lot of chaos, but once the game began developing, I saw a fast game of bluffing and area control.  One player ran away with the game by playing into all 7 regions within about 30 minutes, but the length of the game, paired with its challenge, impresses me.  I definitely want to play this again.

Before I played this, I was concerned that the blind auctions might be too... well, blind.  Having played, I can say that as in Vino, you quickly start to get a feel for where you should play and where you shouldn't - with some margin of error, of course.  This is a rather interesting game, and obviously Goldsieber's production of it is gorgeous.

I want the version with the large round edge pre cut cards - like the expansion kit.  Prefer European source due to astronomical US postage charges.  But anywhere really.

It's nice to have a solo game and this one is quite good.  I have laminated the cards and clip the counters.  Put the map under plexiglass the game game rocks.  Nice job VPG!

RATING: 6.5
The system works, no doubt of that, but the longevity of the game worries me. I have played about 20 games or so and the actual 'events' on the cards no longer have any meaning for me. It needs to have something where the events themselves matter, not just their effect on the various front lines.

RATING: 5
Hard and luck dependent which means I quickly get frustrated and in a bad mood. Otherwise the game is actually quite nice. So less moody players might enjoy it a lot more. :)

I've a few games from VPG (including 3 States of Siege games) and my comments could apply to most of them. Gameplay is very good. This is an extremly enjoyable solitaire experience. Have bought the expansion (12 extra cards with some optional rules) that dont really add much. 

Problem for me is the price point for what in my view are components that are not up to scratch is too high.The map in particular has suffered badly from a dozen odd plays and the cards need to be sleeved straight away or they get very ragged.

RATING: 8.5
Extremely solid solitaire game. Very interesting period in history and the game does a good job of demonstrating how that developed.

The rules are simple and the play is quick. Sometimes the randomness will hurt you but it evens out over the end.

My only main criticism is that the political victory seems like it is the slightly easy way to win - pushing all of your non-essential ops into politics results in a fairly quick victory. However this may be intentional in a thematic sense.

RATING: 8
Simple and ingenious system to be played solitaire.

Many difficult and hard decisions spoiled by roll of the dice.

Very addictive!

Hope to see in future a upgrade of components and gameplay.

RATING: 7
Of the five historical [family=3245]State of Siege[/family] games that I own, this has a unique feature that stands out: your side historically WON the struggle.  The political track makes for icing on the cake with this, by making you risk all to win.  The political declarations and reserve strategies are a great idea.  The army reorganization is also a superb idea: especially the Czar's Gold concept.  This is far more than just pushing back tracks and for that, the designer should be commended.  The historical notes on the cards provide a great narrative.  Finally, the player has the option to accept the Brest-Litovsk and face relief on the Baltic front or fight on and hope for German Capitulation before your own government falls.

Pleasant abstraction. Very difficult to win, which keeps it interesting. The cards have good flavor and the game plays fast, and different every time. Not a brain burner; decisions are limited and everything boils down to rolling. Fun.

"Soviet Dashi". Not played yet. All I can say for now is that I was a bit underwhelmed with the components.

Update: played twice, to use the BGG terminology: "swingy" and almost "fiddly" (for a game as small as this). Having to shuffle in the 2nd and 3rd decks  when the trigger card turns up (in my first game that was the 3rd card in play) is a bit annoying and makes the game more ahistoric than Levee en Masse. It also kept me from restarting the game after the play-through (Ach - sorting the cards again...)
I think I rather play Levee - that's more streamlined.

After thoroughly enjoying Israeli Independence, I invested in the rest of the VPG States of Siege line.  Soviet Dawn did not disappoint.   The simplicity, historical detail, and fast pace create a highly satisfying solo game play experience.   I suspect I will order the expansion.  I look forward to playing the other States of Siege games.

I would give this a slightly higher ratings is the components were better.  For $20 I should get more than this.  I will say that the counter appear to be _slightly_ better than most VP games i have played.  This is a cool game if you don;t know much about the RCW it gives you a good chance to grok it a little better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
At first I thought the game was as good as its sister games Hapsburg Eclipse or Ottoman Sunset, but after a decent number of plays, it really isn't. 

The dice can't be sufficiently migitated, certainly not early on and you don't feel expertise gives you better control of the game.

I know it is a thin line between perfectly playable and/or challenge, but this tips the balance in a too negative way.

So if you want this typical defense kind of game it is quite under the above 2 or Zulus on the ramparts.

A pity, it is my first VP game that didn't make the grade (8/10). I give it a 6 as the theme is not really exciting either compared to other VP games.

Game is much better than I initially thought. It uses the Gamesystem from Levée en masse. I only played the iOS Port of Levée and didn't liked it very much (the reason for that could also be that I don't like to play on the iPhone).
So I was astonished about that one.

During setup I thought "Yeah, only another push your luck thing. AND it looks like Levée... Meeeh."
But as It turns out It has a good flavour is very exciting and sucks you right into the game.

So from me this one gets a big thumbs up! Playtime is about one hour.

At least it's short (15-20min, a couple of my games were even less - my first game was a walk-off 38 point win in about 8 minutes). I picked this up at a con after a number of friends had good things to say about the States of Siege series, but the first couple times I played the game floored me with just how bad it was. You really make almost no decisions; if the events are friendly and you get a good Red Army Reforms result early, you win in a complete walk. These rolls are low-odds, but some of the stuff is crazy powerful, so you should always roll a few times early. Comintern for example is basically an auto-win if you get it; the Train and Tanks are also big and can turn the game into a gimme. Some of the other stuff, not so much. Needless to say, if you get one of the events that gives you a +1 to reforms, spend every action you've got on it. Anyway, if you get one of the good ones, basically you win, if you don't, it's just a dice game. Which is silly; the Red Army Reforms could have been done in a number of ways to make them actually interesting (maybe like the research system in Hitler's War, perhaps) instead of being the game-breaker.

Like too many VPG games, it relies too much on coarse-grained luck. Everything is a 1:6 or 1:3, and really swingy. Also, the card provide almost no narrative feel, and with no nuance to the tracks or resource management, it leaves you feeling empty.

I like VPG, their heart is in the right place, but every game I've played other than No Retreat! has been pretty bad. But really, I think the cardinal sin is just that their stuff is just too expensive. This is a whopping $27 list. That's almost the same as what you're going to pay for FFG's new edition of Lord of the Rings. Soviet Dawn is a fluffy, light, vacuous game that doesn't really work that if I had paid $10 or $15 for, I wouldn't feel too bad about - it killed some time and at least pointed the way to how a good game along these lines might be done. But at $23 (with convention discount), it feels very overpriced.

RATING: 9
Very neat and efficient solitaire design and that packs a helluva lot of history into a 30 minute game. You sit in a central position with various threats advancing inexorably towards you, firing out offensives to keep the enemy at bay, while an array of historical events drive the narrative and the action. Manages to create a genuine sense of tension and risk taking, as the margins for error are small, but playing cautiously won't deliver victory and simply delays the end. Great stuff

Update: bumped up a point. Maddening and addictive. Pound-for-pound one of the best games I have bought. Lincoln's Red Victory will put you in the right frame of mind

01-21-2014: Took this game for a test drive today.  Three games in about 60 minutes.  The game is not very interesting, IMO.  There's not much in the way in tough decisions - and the decisions you do make are heavily dependent on rolling dice.  2 or 3 dice failures in a row will generally have to you reaching into your "freebies" (free additional actions) by the fourth or fifth card draw.

I'm not seeing how this game is won by skill.  It truly is just luck.  Evaluating the threats is easy (whoever is closer to Moscow has to be attacked), deciding to attack is easy.  I don't see the point of *anyone* going for Enhancements to the Soviet military . . . I'm not even sure why it's in the game.  It would have been better if these enhancements had been sprinkled through the deck of cards so that you get them at some point.  The cost-benefit analysis generally makes the decision to try and reorganize the military a bit silly.  With a one-in-six chance, I'm not doing it unless it's to get to Box 9/10 on the Political track or I literally have *nothing* else to do (which is never the case).

Anyway - a fun little game, I guess.

If you want to make the difficulty a little easier, then ignore the Battle Value of the fronts and roll against the box number the enemy army is in.  It makes for a more engaging game, makes decisions a little bit tougher and removes the necessity of changing out Fronts.  As the armies near Moscow, it becomes easier to defeat them, but a string of bad rolls will still lose you the game.  You should be able to win a Political victory pretty easy - so victory should be based on Political Victory in Box 9 *and* a military victory.

Wow. Quickly dealt a crushing defeat in each of my first two games of SD. Not tied in with that, I was not impressed with the game. Look and play of it all did nothing for me yet. 

Edit Sept 2015: pulled out SD again after a few years. Played seven games so far today. Liking it more. Very simple compared to Malta and Zeds. At least as difficult to "win" though. Still not a fan of the look.

My #1 in VPG's States of Siege series. A game I can't win, and I can't stop playing. It (only just) edges out Ottoman Sunset by a nose for my favorite in the series, but it's at the top of my charts for all the same reasons: colorful components, endless replayability, and a brilliant design marriage of fast gameplay, meaningful decisions, historical accuracy and flat out fun. The more I play it, the more subtleties I discover in it. It's that kind of game.

Funny, I expected to enjoy this a lot more. I love the history, but perhaps unlike the other two 'by the numbers' SOS games - Ottoman Sunset & Levee en Masse - I know the story much better so the unfolding tale wasn't as compelling. Nothing wrong with the game, just doesn't compare as well with Zulus, Empires in America or Malta Besieged.

RATING: 7
I like the system, but you can get completely screwed very quickly, even with the Reserve markers. Too much depends on when the Finns come in, and more on when they upgrade, same with the Czar. Historically the Bolsheviks barely survived early on, but were in a better and better position as the war went on. Unfortunately, the historical deck order is almost guaranteed to kill you because the Finns come in early and upgrade within a couple of cards. Stick with the non-expansion and play with the standard rules and hope for the best. I think this is one of the weaker games in the system as a result, but it was an important evolution of the system from Israeli Independence (which has even more wackiness).

Very nice little solitaire game. Your goal is to prvent the opposing armies to reach Moscow following predetermined tracks.


The armies movement is driven by event cards and you can actions to try to push them back (or alternatively increase your political leven or try to improve the quality of your army to have better chances in future combats).

It's heavvily based on luck (dice and cards) but the player's strategy is important (do your best to increase your chances and try to prioritie focus on priorities).

In general, I think it recreates well (in a simple way) the feeling of state of siege that the Soviets hat during the civil war, with lots of things going around and being at the verg of collapse most of the time.

RATING: 6
Solo game where players are trying to establish communist Russia between 1917 and 1922.  Based on the same game system as Israeli Independence, you spend turns flipping up event cards, then working through the sequence of instructions on the cards.  Six enemy "fronts" slowly advance on Moscow, and you lose the game if Moscow falls.  You can spend actions on offensives, to force the enemy fronts back, while praying they'll go inactive, or stay that way for a while yet.  Additional actions are spent on improving your status on the "Political" track, which provides another way to win (9) or lose (0).  Finally, spare actions (hah!) can be used to improve the Red Army, fitting it out with trains, tanks, etc, which provide help in other areas of the game.  A fast moving, fluid and importantly fun solitaire game.  If you take your time and read the cards, you get a good history lesson about this strange and complex period of Russian history.  I enjoyed this one much more than Israeli Independence, which I found fun but very vanilla.  This has a few more switches to flick, a decision or two (accept the Treaty with Germany or fight on?), at the cost of increased playing time (around 30 minutes).  Great little game.

Triumph of Chaos-lite?  Just kidding.  I am so interested in the Russian Revolution and its Civil War arising as a result.  This little game can teach me more about that largely unknown war.  I hope more can be done on this war.  

Setting up the game is a blast to play.  After you put a few counters of 5 "Front" units on the map in the beginning of their relevant track and to set aside the cards in 3 decks - Twilight (at start), Darkness and Dawn, then off you go!  For those of you who are familiar with the State of Siege system, it is much more so.  Anyway, it is the no. 1 in the SoS series and I guess many play this game as their first entry into the series.  Since I played no. 10 Keep up the Fire first and then this game, I can say Soviet Dawn is a much simpler, straight-forward.  For example, in Keep up The Fire, you can maneuver your own International Forces inside the defense "compound".  In Soviet Dawn, you just keep fighting the enemies off the track coming into the heart of Russia - Moscow.  

Losing Moscow means you lost the game with a military defeat.  You can prevent that happen until you win the game by political means.  You can also win militarily by holding on Moscow until the end of the game, presumably having cycled the deck once (although it is not clearly defined as such in the rules....). By then, a measure of the military victory with the number of victory points with reference to the distance of the enemies to Moscow, no. of Front units being removed, no. of resources you use in emergency to save your Soviet regime, and the level of political support you gained on the political level track.  

You can win the game politically by moving your political marker to the 9th place on the track.  Basically you spend your "action points" to "roll" through the track (like the game Roll Through the Ages"), with decreasing chance on higher number on the dice you roll.  For example, you can move one space forward if you roll more than 3 in the first three spaces and then 4 in the next three, and 5 in the last two.  You can modify the dieroll with any card effects. Or you can issue Political Decree (a resorce marker) using no DRM.  There are only two of them in the game so it is best to use them wisely in the more critical moment, like you are just one space short on the track to the political victory!

You can also "reorganize" the Red Army by spending an action to roll, one in six chance, to get the more powerful advantages.  It is random to determine which advantage you get by rolling another dice.  In view of the limited number of actions dictated by the cards and the luck-dependent advantage you can get, I can hardly spend the precious action on this chance.  Perhaps I have yet to see why I should try that course in some point in time of the game.  But this is definitely a scratching point in the game.  For example, if you get Cheka, you reshuffle a just-revealed card into the deck and take 2 free actions.  You can assign Red Army Tank Corps to a particular front and +1 DRM to every offensive on that front.  If you set up Comintern International, +1 DRM on the roll of political level track.  The best advantage in the shelve is Communist Subversion, in which you reverse the phases by conducting Soviet actions before the enemy movement.  This maybe saving your Soviet regime just in time......

I have yet to find a way to win in this game after playing 6 games in a row!  Yes, it is a difficult game but so far I think a lot of the difficulties are luck-dependent on how best your dierolls are.  Certainly the text-rich cards give you a lot of flavor about the history as they tie the enemy movements closely on the track.  However, the areas you can exercise your influence with are quite limited.  I call this kind of game an Action-Reaction system, in which the designer see little things, or strategies, that men can make in an attempt to change the course.  As pessimistic as it seem, putting out the fire next door as it comes imminent is still something akin to human nature.  You have a choice between going right after a political win and fight the enemies only when their troops are next door; or protract the Civil War in fighting them off in the first place long before they enter Petrograd or crossing the Curzon Line.  A protracted war, of course, cost you more resources and time.  It is fun to play the game.  It can be over in 30 minutes.  But it is an exciting experience in 30 minutes, more so if you read the card text. There are 12 additional cards in an expansion that can enrich experience of the gameplay, even after you think you conquer the game.  Next time I fly, I would make sure I will bring this game and the expansion!
------------------------------------------------------------------

I lost 6 games in a row; one time to Southern Front as I was too occupied to advance 1 in 6 chance into political victory on the track. Another one lost to Baltic Germany as an oversight...Once when Finland entered Petrograd and reduced political level to 0, ooops, that little Finnish! When Dunsterforce Lands to Protect Oil Region after Russia Quits! I couldn't help save the game even after two political decrees were issued to rescue the game. The fifth game saw German Baltic Division Lands in Finland, pushing the Finnish into Moscow! Finally, when coup captures Admiral Kolchak, Finland Front enters Moscow! It's been two times in a row losing Moscow to Mannerheim! Instead of the addictive just-one-more-turn to go, it has that begging for one-more-GAME for me to figure out how to win! I should have been executed instead of the Tsar by Lenin's order already for long before I would be given another chance to take command of defending Moscow!

I really want to like this game, but if I'm going to play a solo game I am just much more interested in something like LOTR the card game.

A good improvement on [thing=36241][/thing], is still random but has more options and this improves the game greatly. Yet after multiple plays this game falls short of the mark in that even with all the added chrome and upped complexity its still you reacting to the cards for the entire game.

Big plus point is short playing time. So, don't feel that you've wasted a lot of time if a run of poor dice results blow out your position. On the other hand, the game does feel like the only viable strategy is to try and optimize the probabilities in favour of the player and hope for decent luck! Or, gamble outrageously! Not enough in game to hold my attention for long.

While I laud  the effort to create a fast solitaire game on a grand strategic topic, I found the execution poor, boring, misinformed, and flat. I did not learn anything new on the topic, did not understand any of the why, I realized that my action were more or less random and there was no strategy, only chaos. While the basic idea of the whole serie is indeed sound the fact that there is no real detail means that decisions are few and far between, in the end it is just rolling dice (and in my case hoping the game system will quickly stomp out the virus!). I have never played snakes and ladder when I was a child... I have seen today why I have  no regrets.

The c3i issue looked interesting anyway. This was the clincher.  I need a good game on the Soviet Civil War.

The game itself is an incredibly simple solitaire game of the Civil War, played at a very high level of abstraction.

It sets up and plays very quickly, and seems to hold some challenges.  So for a snappy and well produced solo game on the Soviet Civil War, you could do worse.

(The only problem is that it left me wanting more - just at the time when Triumph of Chaos second edition is in the works at Clash of Arms).

Best completely stand alone game (not a scenario game) that I have played out of C3I.   Easy to learn, don't recall any rules glitches,  fun, replay able.   Very educational concerning a very little know subject in America.    Usually I am correcting a game to make it play more historical,  this one taught me history.   Only complaints I can think of is that you definitely need to use the 10 political point rule (designer already foresaw the problem) and it was a bit odd when I had the active fronts reduced to 2 total and still had Moscow captured

RATING: 9.7
 received this as part of my wargames Secret Santa Ipackage last year (along with wmtte and their respective expansions) and it has taken me this long to get it onto the table. Much of this hiatus is due to having to wait until my wife and children are away visiting her family. Anyway, for the last month or so I have had SD pretty much permanently set up on my dining table and have played a lot of games of Soviet Dawn.

Soviet Dawn is one of the ‘States of Siege’ series from Victory Point Games and the mechanics are quite easy to grasp and play is smooth, though at time frustration can ride pretty high in the saddle. The player represents the leadership of Bolshevik faction in the newly emerging Soviet Union and has to contend with a number of different domestic and foreign enemies all of who want to crush the revolution it its infancy. In game terms this happens when Moscow is lost. It’s also possible to lose when the Communist political situation becomes untenable and the new regime collapses. To stave off disaster (i.e. to play) the player will turn over a card, deal with the event and then allocate resources (in the form of actions) towards a number of differing activities. These can include offensives to push back encroaching enemy ‘fronts’, improving political capital or gain new tools to further the revolutionary agenda. The game is won when the deck is exhausted (military victory) or the political capital chart reaches its maximum level (political victory).

When an action is allocated a die is rolled and if the roll is successful and play advances from there. Very simple to play and dependent on luck to a certain degree (but there is so much dice rolling it should even out) but it does have a fair bit of strategic depth - including deciding the optimal point to play political decrees or reserve offensives. That said, bad luck will scupper you as the Enemies of the People are relentless. I (mis)played one game where I lost on the first card:

Firstly, I like it. I really do. I hadn’t done much solo gaming beforehand, but I found Soviet Dawn to be a thoroughly engaging experience. I like the easy-to-learn system and enjoy the cards can generate a different narrative with each game. Each game plays differently and offers a host of challenging decisions. Very much worth buying if you’re looking for a solo game with an interesting theme and great replayability. I see myself getting a lot of use out of this one in years to come - a winner!

Pretty bad both as a game and a simulation.  Lots of history on the cards, but whatever choice you make is still dependent for its effect on a narrow-probability die-roll, resulting in a need to luck out both on the card-draw and on the die roll for every. single. thing. you try to do.  
Not broken, but a very painful experience.  I'd rather stick a pencil in my eye than play this again.

The "State of Siege" system never quite appealed to me as it seemed too random sounding, but I got the C3i magazine with this game (nice production quality, by the way) and darned if the game isn't addictive "just one more" fun! It can be over quite quickly if luck goes against you (e.g. in just a few minutes), but it's so easy to set up and just play "one more". 

I'm interested in the Russian Revolution, so this was the State of Siege game that sounded most appealing to me. The game has lots of historical flavor on the cards, and a good accompanying historical article if you have the C3i issue edition. Pretty clear well-written short rules. (I created [[Soviet Dawn FAQ]] to cover a few common questions.)

Incredibly tense to play, though VERY luck-dependent (losing the Finns on the first turn, then the Allies on turn 5 and not having Poland enter till very late in the last game I played definitely helped -- losing my one political point and thus losing the game on the first turn of the game I played before that definitely hurt!). So it's more fun if you can roll high numbers all the time. Captures the grand sweep of the Russian Civil War with more actual historical info than games a hundred times its size, but playable in 10-15 minutes. An exciting sequel to Israeli Independence.

I got it as another state of siege games because it is one of the earlier ones and plays faster. And the theme interests me. And well, it was cheaper in the C3I magazine than buying the polybag edition. After playing a few times (even won one, but that was lucky draw) shows lots of promise, this game easily is done in 30 minutes and setup is super fast. Play - as in all SoS games - is mostly risk management with some press-your-luck moments. But the cards and available power-up choices give a nice flavor over all those dice rolls. No idea if it ever will get to a higher level for me, because after all it is a ton of randomness, but at least it's quick and fun randomness.

Plays like all of the other State of Siege games - but does feel more "winnable" in senses that Victory conditions are based on how well you have done on certain tracks instead of simply staving off doom for 40 cards.

Again, choices are generally limited to what front/track you want to focus on - and then subjected to the whims of fate based off of fate and dice rolls.

All that being said, learned quite a bit about the revolution - so in that sense, very successful.

I don't know what it is about some of these VPG titles, but they have some "challenging" rules sets. Usually not very long, but it seems like every word of every sentence has to be pondered. So many little details and exceptions. I like this company, and this game fulfills my needs on this topic, but they could shoot for a little more elegance in design.

(C3i version)

My first read on this one was that it was overly simplistic and far too random. Almost every action is resolved by rolling a single D6 and usually, needing a 5 or a 6 to complete the action. As you might suspect, it's fairly difficult to do anything at all.

I stuck with it though and once I finally managed to get out of the first deck of events and into the second, the game felt like it was finally giving me some decisions to make. The opposing forces began to wax and wane, sometimes even retreating, as opposed to the all out assault of the first stages of the game.

Like most CDG's there is a definite learning curve to the strategy. Your first few games will end very quickly, as unexpected events will sabotage your efforts and often undo a few turns of work. With experience, you can start to anticipate these and adjust your decision making accordingly.

I think I'd have a hard time buying a full production model of this game, as I just don't know that there is 30 bucks worth of fun here. It is sort of addictive though and you can't beat a satisfying 20 minute war game, so maybe there is.

Ottimo gioco in solitario che ripercorre la rivoluzione di Ottobre sia a livello militare che a livello politico, il gioco e fatto in maniera molto accurata anche se la meccanica non è molto sviluppata. Ma è interessante anche per le nozioni che si imparano dalla lettura delle carte.

It's a fine game, but I don't like it as much as others in the State of Siege series.
There's something repetitive and swingy about Soviet Dawn that keeps me (relatively) at bay.

I can see playing this game a lot!  It's simple, but difficult.  Quick to play, and really evocative of the subject.

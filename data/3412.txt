Another fine offering in GMT's [family=54][/family] series.  As good as Saratoga is, this game is even better.  The combat system and game mechanics, that transfer through to the entire series, are excellent.  This is better than Saratoga because the battle is so much more open with varying strategies, whereas Saratoga has fewer options.  It has lots of replayablity.

RATING: 8.5
I really like the series and this battle is the best of it this far IMHO.

I play it with higher start Morale levels (+4 for BR and US) to lengthen gameplay because the battle has (in my previous plays) tended to end soon after Howe's flank attack started and before it has fully unfolded. So the main part of the battle did not happen.

Perhaps the feint attack at Chad's fort has always had too many casualties.

I like the battle this way. Favors the Brits because of their numbers and quality but the patriots are hard to beat because of position advantage.1

I love the games in this system and have really enjoyed studying about the American Revolution.  Brandywine seems like an obvious choice as a game I'd like.

The best thing about this one is the presence of George Washington. Any game where you're either controlling him running around the battlefield or (of you're the British) trying to capture him...its a great start.

The issue of crossing the Brandywine is an interesting dilemma for the British. The bivouac constraints on the Americans feel a bit artificial, similar to Saratoga...except there it made a bit more sense historically with Gates and Arnold. Here, the timed release feels a bit overly restrictive (although there is probably a game-breaking strategy without that constraint.)

I like this game among the games in the system a lot. However, the system itself does have a bit of a problem with the rich getting richer. If you get the first couple lucky breaks in battle, morale will favor you and it will tend to snowball into a win. I suppose that may be a good historical simulation of these types of battles, but it can be a bit frustrating if you're on the other side of it. The upside is that these games play quite quickly and there tends to be a lot of replayability due to the chaos of the close combat outcomes.

The biggest complaint I see, about the fiddliness of the tactics chits.....I don't mind that at all. Sure, its mostly a rock-paper-scissors mechanism (although there is a bit more to it than that when you consider strategic withdrawals and the need to prevent them), but it also provides a rich narrative adding enough flavor to the game to warrant its inclusion. You get a picture of how each little battle unfolded as you see a flank attack repulsed by other tactics, etc. 

I own all the games in this system and I'd play them any time.

I wish there was a VASSAL module for this game.

Very fun game which departs from the normal war game through the clever mechanic of tactics chits which are chosen in secret and then revealed simultaneously, thereby leading to some interesting conclusions of battles.  Great components and relatively simple rules which are only marred by annoying errata (who is editing for GMT?).  The American Revolution doesn&#039;t get much better than this.

Part of system that I just don't get. Aside from some pretty graphics, it does not at all evoke 18th Century combat or the American Revolution. This system is so bland and simple that you could port to almost any era--to the same sterile effect. Though it may be meant as an easy, introductory game, it is still too dull to be worth even minimal effort. I'd have a rosier view of it had it been published--and I had played it--in 1975, like SPI's old B&G Quad.

Good system and very educational. The full length game looks intimidating at first, but it is playable in about 4-6 hours once you are familiar with the rules. Lots of options for maneuvering and strategy, more so than other games in this series. My only gripe is that the game is almost over by the time the majority of the British reinfocements enter at hex D and steamroll their way up Forks Road. Many of those British units will never even be used in a combat. If the game was a few turns longer, I think it would be better. This would allow some real combats to develop from the flank attack. As it stands, my games always end feeling totally unfinished, simply because the alloted number of game turns has expired.

This is my favorite game in the series. I've played the full length scenario three or four times now. I disagree with comments asserting that the Brits are too powerful. The impetus of attack lies on them, and they'll get pounded by the deadly U.S. artillery as their morale advantages is whittled away. The U.S. has won as many campaign games as the British at my table. I think the game is roughly balanced.

If you are a fan of the Miklos Great Battles of the American Revolutionary War system by GMT, this is a "7."  If you are not, then it won't matter what this game is rated because while it contains all of the best elements it also showcases what some perceive as the worst parts of the system (chasing purely after local tactical advantage to drum down enemy army morale, regardless of the overall situation or geographic objectives).  Against a competent Brit, it's a hard road for Washington and LaFayette.  Von Knyphausen's Prussians can do more than just a feint with some luck and just as the Amis are trying to deal with that, the Brit flanking attack comes in.  The excitement level is quite high is this game.

A fine game, with several interesting scenarios, though it is hard for the Americans to win the campaign game due to their poor morale differentials in most combats The Brits will win enough battles to cause a morale collapse by the end of the game. Needs some kind of bidding mechanism to balance (i.e the British player gives up X points of morale)

For all the comments about how it's simple and easy to teach, I ultimately found it an exercise in chrome with a combat system that fussed around with a great many modifiers to reach a fairly indecisive result most of the time.  The situation itself is further marred by a great many special rules aimed at kludging the battle into coming out in a historical manner.  Would much rather play Worthington's Clash for a Continent.

Very interesting simulation of a fairly large scale American Revolutionary War battle.  The conventional wisdom suggests that this game offers more scope for creative manuevering than the other titles in the series.  Having only played Guilford and Eutaw Springs before this, I cannot really confirm or deny this but I would tend to believe that it's true as my first play saw fronts opening and closing all over the large map.  In enjoy this series although I do find that the tactics chits can slow down the gameplay somewhat.

Thought the higher unit density means the combat modifiers and tactic chits could possibly put a dent into my enjoyment of it - but enjoyed Kny. Feint scenario. Will rate after playing the Tournament Scenario.

What I like most about this title, after reading the rules, is having several scenarios. Kny. Feint is very quick, for example, meaning you don't need to spend hours on the full campaign.

Following Saratoga in GMT's American Revolution battle series, this gives a little more involved battle. Interestingly the quote from George Washington on the cover has a date by it of September 11, (1777) and I think this game came out in 2000 - they never knew how infamous that date would become in just a year...

Despite really liking the series, I was hesitant to try this one as I thought it would be too big for its britches. I was wrong - this is a terrifc title, full of flavor and strategy for both sides. Bigger and better, it's a real slugfest. Richly rewarding to prevail, especially as the Americans. 

My favorite in the AmRev series so far...

The system makes back to back initiative very powerful. Once you're losing morale, it's very difficult not to spiral down & get your army back on his feet. The game is fast playing and not especially difficult to learn. I like the tactics chit resolution system, they add an element of bluffing to the combat ; even if it makes the game a little slower with PBEM.

Elegant system captures the essentials.
Rules would really benefit from being rewritten more clearly.

I like this game! WWII can be played easily in a weekend, and the game can replicate very well history. Or players can change strategies and see what happens. Some mechanics are really clever. One point less for the map not suited to the game (it really deserved 2 maps), and for the price (some publishers seem to profit too much on players in the last years, with prices too high if compared to the quality of the products).

Just finished our first game. Played over a couple of days - full campaign; 3-player. 

Very clever game which appears to play historically without feeling scripted. At one level the game is fairly simple - but it is nuanced.

One thing it isn't is WiF - that's a good thing from a rules clarity POV. From a game complexity POV it may be a good or a bad thing based on your perspective.

Just got the game and am working through the introductory scenarios.  Seems like it's going to be fun.

One critique:  the map spaces for Europe are just too small. I'm gonna scan that section of the map and print it out on an 8.5 x 11 sheet.  I can't imagine playing the full game on those teenie areas.

RATING: 7.5
Takes a while to grok the rules but once you do it flows pretty smoothly. Victory conditions are a bit of a fiddle faddle but make sense once you get going. I have to say this game is very addictive and a lot of fun.

RATING: 7.5
My rating might improve slightly with more play.  This is a strategic level take on WWII with a lot of design choices made to ensure a quick playing game that still includes all those parts that make WWII what it is.  A game I definitely need to go out and purchase.

RATING: 7.8
Played a few starting scenarios. What I like:

- Smart intro scenarios that are quite good to get you started for such a "big" strategic WW2 game.

- Certainly good to play the first scenarios without much studying.

I could play within an hour after opening the box and my second try was flawless (or so I guess).

I would have liked a detailed index.

I will evaluate the system more over the coming weeks.

As an old 3R fan, I am nog against the WiF look and feel of this game. I guess when everything is playing with the FULL Campaign rules, it would be good to compare it with the old 3Reich game play.

After one game with all rules and five players there are some things to work on. Not all rules were clear (Sea Battle resolution with some Air battle in the first place, some unbalanced victory points like Germany and England/France, which forces are allowed to attack a harbor,...) but the most important fact is: It is fun!!!

RATING: 7
This game has been described as a game for A&A players looking for something a little more complex with more historical flavor without being overly burdening. This game fits that bill. The gameplay is thoroughly engaging and the way units are researched and built adds a unique layer of strategy to the game from the very beginning as far as how you decide to build up your nation's forces. Do you want to try and make Germany a naval power in this game and contest the Allies in the Atlantic and the Med? You can do that in this game! The game will still play long, likely anywhere between 8-12 hrs for a playthrough. The game has an excellent historical flavor from the use of real army command-level units (i.e. German Panzer Army Afrika, US 18th Airborne Corps, etc). The only reason I'm giving it a 7 is because the component quality is questionable and there's not a lot here despite its hefty price tag. The map is cheaply made and incredibly too small for all the counters that come with the game, especially the larger counters. The rulebook is disorganized and very wordy, which significantly contributes to its 40+ pages. Country setup sheets are included but there are no player aid sheets specifically just for commonly used rules. Instead the designer has added common rules to the map itself in the form of tables and text boxes, but in a very unorganized and seemingly random manner that overly clutters the map. If a 2nd edition was released that fixed these issues, I would easily rate this game a 9.

Rules can be a bit confusing to get your head around (and remember), but once you work it out it is quite the good game. 
Just don't Over Think it and you'll be fine.

Components are top notch, as you expect from a Compass game.
Lots of fun, I find myself thought out the day at work thinking about it and wanting to get home to play it.

A great game to have in your collection for a 'faster' wargame.

Playtested the last versions of the game before publishing. The game does some things extremely well (the battle of the Atlantic is very well done and integrated into the game system, for instance). My only quibbles are some historicity ones (amphibious assaults over long distances are too easy; the Chinese forces, as well as some of the minor American allies like Mexico and Brazil, are too flexible). The game can replicate the historical war, but should be sandboxy enough for those that want to try different strategies.

I think this game has the potential to be great, but we are not there yet. 

-No index to the rules. 
-The combat system deserves to be simplified. 
-The map is "special" but functional. In Europe though, there is hardly enough space in some areas for the counters.

RATING: 9
World War II on the quick and dirty, a kind of advanced Axis and Allies. The heart of the war is simulated with little fuss and it allows changes in history but especially strategy, as provided by variable victory conditions.

The rules are a bit all over the place, but the inherent mechanics are simple and effective. Some common sense approaches to rules questions is recommended. 

It has its weird elements. Italy is active and fighting on turn 1 but it is easy enough to fix.

Only big gripe is the components are pretty subpar. + and - signs are hard to read. Map would be cool back in 1999.

UPDATE: A flop with gaming group. Sold it off. :(

Uh-uh. Was hoping for well developed WiF Lite. Some innovative concepts, but just wasn't for us; struck us as an A&A in need of more development. Also, price is steep regarding the bits you get.

I helped with some of the development and playtesting.  Blitz! does a great job of recreating WWII strategic decisions in a compact design.  The victory point mechanism is well integrated into gameplay which keep the game tight into late turns.

Game has a bit of a learning curve, but the rules provide excellent programmed scenarios to sequentially guide instruction. The learning curve involves much "pealing back layers" in understanding how different parts of the rules work together (for example, the US Pearl Harbor fleet is locked in place because Pearl Harbor is not US "home territory" (not named with the special "home area font") & neutral nations may only move ships between home ports). The rules have seemed utterly complete, the game quite historical at the abstract level it shoots for, and the design allows much "what if" gaming,

this game is little bland. There is too little detail and too little subtlety. Moves are pretty obvious and decisions are not very interesting.

Tech mechanic is interesting but too abstract.

Whole game is still too long to be easily playable and small scenarios are unappealing.

I will probably play this if asked to play campaign, but I would probably not suggest that.

RATING: 6
First, other than some of the graphics, this is NOT WORLD IN FLAMES. This is super-advanced Axis and Allies (or whatever). It is a somewhat fun, somewhat playable global wargame.

PRO:
- a pre-war start option is nice - to change the set up, however it heavily favors the allies. (i.e., if you do all that happened, the Axis would come out BEHIND what historically happened)

- Nice addition of force pool units allow for the expansion of units and types as the war progresses.

- the idea of making each turn shorter, so that later in the war as the belligerents geared up more is quite clever.


CONS:

- Price. Wow, it is expensive for how little you get (small unmounted map, too few players aid cards, and a couple of counter sheets.). Should be about $50, not $84!!!!!

- Map small, hard to read, and not attractive. (advertised as 'large'? when did a 22x34 inch map become large? MOST games this is standard!!!! and for a GLOBAL game, this is tiny!). Another truly unfortunate decision was the division of the map. For whatever reason the map is divided not in the middle of the US, but the pacific. Thus tha Pacific war is carried out on both ends of the map, rather than one side. Makes it hard to follow tha game.

- Play aids are incomplete and not helpful.

- Rules are missing in areas - and need better indexing and a proper index in the back. (for example, land area combat rule 5.3 goes on for three pages without one sub paragraph identifier).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable game but rules could be tighter, a lot of clarifications are needed. Scale is very high both spatially and temporally, requiring players to view each turn in very broad terms. Be warned however that combat is very luck depended and a bad roll will often undermine even a high-odds attack (the dreaded "s" result).

Very interesting. It really keeps World in Flames spirit and you can complete it in less time. We played the 3 starting scenarios in just an evening.

I do agree taht the rules are not wonderful writen and that I wish the small map would be made from cardboard. But We really enjoyed it.

A hidden jewel. One of the best modern wargames in the strategic level. It has some flaws (rulebook, map erratas), but its virtues redeem any problems it may have.

The full WW2 in a few sessions, solo friendly and with lots of strategies to try: different units to build, well thought combat system...

A must have for anyone who wants an strategic ww2 game and does not have the time, money or space to invest into a monster wargame.

Fantastic game, very playable, with clear rules well writen. I really appreciate the different scenarios to learn the game and some of them are really interesting with a great replay value.
With this game you can play the WWII all over the world  with all the great strategic décisions in a few hours!
Thank you Dave and congratulation for this great job!

This style game is not my normal game, but I'm really enjoying this! At first I found a few of the mechanics to be odd (the triangles in particular), but now I find them quite easy and they add a nice flavor to the game play!  Still working my way up to the full game with the gaming group I'm playing with, enjoying the ride and looking forward to a full on game soon!

Does the whole war in ~10 hours.
Simple mechanics with clever design, lots of stuff to like.
Couple of minor rules quibbles: amphib assaults over range are too easy ; some historical options aren't available (US subs cannot reach Japanese convoys from Pearl for example) but on the whole it's a big scale game and you have to zoom out a bit..

Rating down a point for the original map which was too small for the high price tag.

A grand strategic application of the WiF system (really a far derivative at best) or better yet, Axis & Allies on steroids. I like the simplification of the units distilled down to counters representing the major army, fleet, or air corps involved. Gaming the entire war in 10 hours is an even faster accomplishment than playing Axis & Allies Anniversary Edition in one sitting.

RATING: N/A
UPDATE:  Out now.  There are WIF elements in Blitz!, but it is quite a different game.  But a very interesting GLOBAL treatment of WW2 at a lower level of detail than WIF, so a game can be played in maybe 10-12 hours - much quicker!

(OBE comment:  This game, not yet out, is World in Flames greatly reduced.  Still a long game, but with only a couple of hundred instead of thousands of counters, the global campaign should be playable in a weekend (short for WIF!), and scenarios in a long evening.)

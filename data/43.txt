Moon's original network and stock portfolio building game.  In some ways reminiscent of Acquire in that the value of an airline's shares depends on the size of its network.  While Acquire gives some companies an intrinsically higher value, Airlines gives some of its companies greater scope to grow than others.  I think this was the first game I came across to have scoring at randomly determined points in the game, which produces a nice tension between developing networks and slapping down shares.  Airlines does this very randomly and on the whole I prefer Union Pacific's approach of seeding scoring cards fairly evenly throughout the deck.  

Production values are pretty good.  Artwork is fairly uninspired and some of the colours are hard to differentiate in less than perfect light.  The rules are clear.

Nice game, but shows its age and needs a few fixes.  House rules used:
1.  All players must be able to start a company on their first turn.
2.  Can discard stock cards 2 for 1.  Discarded cards become available subsequently.
3.  When the card deck runs out, all players can discard unwanted route cards and exchange.
4.  Shuffle Wurtungs into a draw pile which only the last player draws from.  In this way the later players are not disadvantaged by the player order.
5.  Drawing a route card then playing one of four slows the game down.  Better to replenish to four cards at the end of your turn so that you can prepare for your move before your turn.

(Abacus/Alan R Moon) Not a bad game, but really there is no reason to be playing this instead of Union Pacific in my opinion. The key issue is the aesthetics, which are a real show-stopper, but UP is also better-balanced and the UP itself adds an important extra level of strategy and tactics. Airlines is the original, but UP is better.

The game is similar to the Sid Sackson classic, Acquire, in that players are competing to become majority stockholders in several highly-abstracted companies' with the player owning the most valuable portfolio at the end being the winner.

The game that Union Pacific became.  Clever game about building chains of airline routes around the USA, and investing in via shares.  The board is a bit more restricted than Union Pacific, and sneaky rules like sabotage make this game a bit meatier, and more sinister.

RATING: 7
With a few house rules, I prefer this to Union Pacific, because the board play actually matters.

1. Not a house rule per se, but it's very important for ease of play that the stock cards be marked to show which type of routes that airline can claim.

2. Use four Wertung cards.  After going around the table two or more times (use chart from optional rules), shuffle one into each quarter of the remaining deck.  The fourth Wertung card ends the game.

3. Start with four flight cards instead of three, and always draw a new flight card at the END of your turn if "founding an airline" or "expanding the flight network."  (This isn't much of a change, since the standard rules allow you to draw a flight card before expanding the flight network.)

4. When "expanding the flight network," if you don't play a flight card, you may draw two and then discard one from your hand (hand of flight cards increases by one, just as in the standard rules).  You still get your stock card as usual.

5. Use the "bonus points" optional rule.

RATING: 5
Rating based on 1 play. Found the graphic design difficult to deal with, and the game play quite slow for the number of decisions you have to make (though, in all fairness, that's probably the fault of my group. Sigh).

Perhaps better familiarity with the map would make it flow better.

Thought the stock vs route extension balancing mechanism was really neat, but not exciting.

RATING: 5
It's hard going back to earlier incarnations of games you already like.  I tried to give Airlines the benefit of the doubt, but Union Pacific really is better in almost every way.  Airlines definitely is inferior component wise - the colors are very close together and it is annoying having to handle all of the small little discs - the plastic trains are so much more convenient.  The random shuffling of the scoring cards into the share deck doesn't seem right, as scoring cards can pop up too frequently.  You also know when the game is going to end, which I find less enjoyable than the relative surprise of UP/Get the Goods.  The underlying game is still enjoyable, and this plays pretty quickly, but the train theme and improved components just makes a lot more sense.

Traded away.

RATING: 7
In the same vein as Union Pacific, but without the UP stock, and with slightly more interesting board play (with sabotage!).  I'd rank this slightly above Union Pacific, but I generally prefer stock collection games where lines merge and pay out (Acquire, Stephenson's Rocket, etc.).

I am not a big fan of Alan's games, though he did have a couple of excellent hits from his early era which I do enjoy and airlines is one of them. The game is all about expanding air routes and trying to retain control of the shares in them. Some excellent choice making mechanisms and midgame scorings make this a challenging but fun game. I still remember a quick game of this at the last knockings of a Ramsdencon with Steve Jones, Wendy and three others, we had an hour left and we sat down and played this in the alloted time - and with new players too. It were great.

I like parts of this game more than Union Pacific while disliking other parts.  Parts I like are the tighter requirements for "track" laying.  However, I dislike that the track cards do not show what airlines they can be laid down for as "track".  I like the part about laying down one stock only and being able to commit sabotage against an opponent, both denying them potential income and blocking a route option.  I dislike that one plays through the whole stock deck before the game ends as the endgame dwindles into a collect all the stock you can and then lay them down as you win majorities - very little angst or fear about the game ending prematurely with a fourth scoring card that denotes the end of the game and final scoring for Union Pacific.  Also interesting is the part where early in the game you can found an airline by laying down initial stock and track and then still picking another stock from the display!

A stock and connection game where the big decision is a) do I pick up more stock into my hand hoping a new scoring round doesn't come up before my next turn OR b) do I lay down track now, increasing my stock value.  There's also an ability to sabotage but it's pretty weak and isn't used very often.  I remember liking the updated Union Pacific more but I need to play that again to remember why.

Horribly written rules make this simple little game tougher to learn than need be. Like any game that depends on the luck of the draw, you could have games where nothing goes your way, but there's enough control so that you can earn the satisfaction of a game well played, even if, by no fault of your own, you have no chance of winning.

This predecessor to Union Pacific plays better (due to not having a Union Pacific-like company) and is less frustrating.  But the sabotage element prevents me from liking it even more.  I think I'd rather play this than Union Pacific.

This is Alan Moon's predecessor to Union Pacific. I have not yet played Union Pacific, so I can not compare the two. Airlines is a clever stock investment game about establishing airline companies and expanding the routes, thereby receiving and accumulating stock shares. The top two stock holders in each airline score points towards victory.

An interesting feature of the game is that the scoring rounds are randomly determined via the dreaded "Wertung" (scoring) cards. Some players dislike this mechanism because it introduces some randomness, but I think this doesn't detract from the game and more than justify itself due to the level of anxiety it adds to each and every turn. If the randomness really bothers you, there is always the commonly used randomness mitigating method of spliting the stocks deck into 3 roughly equal parts and shuffling in one Wertung card in each and then stacking  the 3 parts into one draw pile. Alhambra uses a similar method to kick off scoring rounds.  You can even go further and set aside about 10 cards before splitting the deck into 3 parts and shuffling in the Wertung cards. Then stack the 3 parts and put the 10 cards on top. This prevents a premature scoring round.

I think that this is the best in the Get The Goods/Union Pacific family.  The cards are easier to process and I really like the ticket value added to the routes.  The sabotage is a great option, and the lack of UP stocks arguably shake that game up in strange ways make Airline in my mind superior.

The colors are a little close, so I Sharpied them. I'd like the numbers on the board to be bigger, I may paste the board up.

Much like UP there is EXTREME luck in the card draws and scoring.  I do the UP split and shuffle with the score cards.  I like the rule where you can't score until each player has taken two turns (this solves a big problem in UP). I think it should be implemented throughout the game to prevent double scoring.

Makes me appreciate UP that much more.  Airlines is a god game in its own right, but UP makes significant improvements with rule changes, especially with the way the scoring cards are shuffled into the deck and doing away with the numbers on the track cards.  The design and components are upgraded in UP, particularly with the colored trains and overall appearance of the board and cards.  In fact, the colors in Airlines are far too similar and I kept confusing the pink and red trains throughout the game.

This rating is in all likelihood undeserved.  However, I played a game where I got hosed at every turn by the card draws, and it really soured me on it. Any game with a significant chance component has the ability to produce freak results for one or more players. In this case though, there was nothing else in the game to make me interested in trying it again. The theme and mechanics have been repeated scores of times by now.

The precursor to Union Pacific.

Airlines is simultaneously better and worse than UP, in that there's gratuitous blocking (the good) and increased randomness in the scoring and card draws (the bad).

Regardless, given that both Airlines and UP have their own distinct game-ruining problems, I don't particularly care for either.

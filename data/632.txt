Played this a while ago, and picked it up for lunch time gaming.  I've so far only played it with 2, each of us drawing two cards when the balloon crashes to make it more interesting.  Since the box says 3-6, I'm waiting to give it a rating until I've played it with that many, but even with 2, it was definitely fun!

An enjoyable exercise in pushing your luck. I think it needs a good group of people to really shine... I had the pleasure of playing this with Greg Schloesser, Gee and a bunch of other awesome people at the Oasis of Fun. Those 20 minutes were one of the highlights of the convention for me!

Hey...nice game for a pizza and wine night.

It's easy to play and learn, fun and quick.  Ok, so it's not a game you'd play for a serious night of gaming, but if you've got a few friends around for the night and someone says "hey, let's play a game," this one is a perfect one to pull out.  Nobody will be bored whilst you explain the rules and then they'll have a blast playing it.  

She may not be the woman of your dreams, but she is a dizzy floosy who knows how to entertain you in the wee small hours.  Nice bits too (oo'er, missus).

It can be quite the hilarious game. Very simple mechanic. It's really the dialogue as you play as people discuss whether they think a person has the cards needed that makes it fun. When everyone bails or when everyone crashes are the funniest moments. There's too much luck though, so you just may not win even if you picked the best choice (jump or not jump) every time, especially with more people.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent push your luck game with some scope for bluffing and a fair chunk of luck.  It anticipates Diamant/Incan Gold by making the players a party (of balloonists in this case) and every turn giving each one the option to bail out before the journey continues.  The odds are less calculable than in Diamant because each turn you are chancing the roll of several dice and that the active player has the necessary cards in hand to deal with them.  That probably makes Cloud 9 the slightly better gateway game because calculating hardcore types will win less often.  

The components in the Out of the Box edition are pretty good.  The balloon basket that "floats" above the board is nicely done.  The artwork is simple, jolly and functional.

after hearing about the superiority of the fx schmid version i didn't have very high hopes for this one.  after 1 play i found it more entertaining than diamant, but i think i'll still end up playing diamant more often.  i love the element of reading people to try to figure out if they have the cards or not.  50 points seems like far too long for a game though, i'd like to play to 30.  i also would treat a wild as one wild, not filling the entire order, and the fx schmid pass the dice cards do sound good.

A nice little push your luck game.  The components (cards & board) feel and look a little on the low quality side, on the other hand you can buy this game for $10 at online stores.

The one thing that you need to remember is that if you're going to be pilot, you need to decide whether or not to bail out on the previous turn in order to get any points.

RATING: 7
Push your luck + Bluffing = A great family game.  The lower levels can get a bit tedious (like the first 5 questions on Who Wants to Be a Millionnaire), but when the balloon gets up higher the excitement is greatly increased.  It's the perfect game for me to break out with new gamers because the rules are so simple, but the gameplay is still fun and intense.  More bluffing strategies than you expect at first blush.

This game works great for all ages and challenges the players to read their opponents as well as remember what their opponents are missing.  Perhaps the one flaw of the game is the fact that one good run can cause a real runaway leader situation.  But with a little luck any player can go on a good run and catch-up.  It seems like this game always comes down to the last turn and several people have a strong chance of winning.

Fun, press your luck game.  I, apparently, stink at it but will definately play.  It's tense and you have to pay attention to what people are playing. You gotta jump out to keep moving on the track...but there is nothing better when you say "screw it", go to the top and succeed.

December 2013 - A recent revival of the game, for me.  Still holds up as a fun, tense, push your luck game.  

Feb 2014 - revival going strong.  Up to a 9.  

Jan 2017 -  A Classic.  Solid 10.

Snrg.  Might like this better if the wild card were not so overpowered (i.e. could only substitute for one card rather than all cards).  I normally like push-your-luck games, but this one doesn't do much for me at all.  The only reason I'm even neutral towards it is that it's mercifully quick.  (Rating goes up to 7 with house rule that wild cards can only sub for one card.)

Excellent game - good, light family style game of pushing your luck.  Turns move quickly, the draw of the cards and/or roll of the dice is sometimes a killer, but it's a short and fun filler game - so this is acceptable!  I suspect the more players play, the better the game is... more plays will tell.

Play with a couple of rules from the FX Schmid version. This is just as good a push-your-luck game as Diamant, and a step behind Can't Stop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The first game didn't go very well; we spent the first 7/8 turns in the first cloud because for many trips the very first pilot didn't have the right cards. And I was expecting something more exciting (or at least at the same level) than Diamant. So the enthusiasm went down more and more. May be it was just an accident, so the 6.5 rating states my optimism; I'll give the game another chance and the rating may increase (or lower down)
-----------------------
UPDATE: we made two other games and understood that the game is more subtle than you may think at a first glance. Even when all dice show a blank face the choice of what to do is not obvious. It's definitely a 7.5 now

Fun little filler.  Push your luck is great to bring out from time to time.. but playing to 50 feels too long... maybe it'll feel right after a few more plays, I think I got spoiled with the game length of Diamant.  I like the Out of the Box ruleset.

RATING: 7
On the surface, it's a fairly simple press-your-luck game that even young children can enjoy. With a group of teens or adults, it has some bluffing (and with 5 or 6 players memory) elements that raise its interest level. It's the sort of game that would appeal to the mass market, if only OTB sold through those channels. I was a bit disappointed to hear that there is a sort of pass-the-buck on the piloting job card in the German edition that didn't make it into the US version. I'm not sure how much that would add to the play, but dumbing things down for the only reason of dumbing things down seems self-defeating.

Entertaining little game that accomplishes exactly what Incan Gold does.  Simple streamlined push your luck mechanic.

One thing which I found slightly annoying was that the balloon starts on a score of 1 every round (the longer you hang there and push your luck the higher the score).  There's no reason not to stay in the balloon at 1 and the board should really start at 2 to cut down on time.

This is a very fun, good-natured game.  We have tried both the FX Schmid and Out of the Box versions.  The Out of the Box one is alot of fun with a bunch of people, but doesn't work for 2.  The FX Schmid version's Pass the Barn cards and additional rules make the game richer and add more decision making.  We like the balloon piece from Out of the Box, but it would work better if the board didn't have so many folds in it.  The artwork from the FX Schmid version is much nicer, and is what attracted me to the game in the first place.  Each card color corresponds to a different symbol in the FX Schmid version, but the colors on the dice are easier to tell apart in the Out of the Box version.

A good "press your luck" game. I prefer Diamant or Can't Stop, but this one can serve as a nice change of pace. The components also give a nice visual feel and helps it appeal to younger and non-gamers. I wish that the current edition had preserved the card mix of the original. 

Update: 18 May 2008 - Finally had the opportunity to play the original F.X. Schmidt edition. I like the "Pass the Barn" cards, but I really like the components of the newer edition.

I LOVE THIS GAME. Probably needs 4+ players to be at its best and has just the right amount of minimal thought for a quick 30 minute filler. Had it for a couple years before I even played it and now regret all those missed opportunities. Have also played Celestia and feel this version is fine without the extra "gamer" cards.

Man, my first game I had 15 of the same colored card. I had no idea how it was happening, every time I picked up, it was a green. I was visibly frustrated and everyone knew I had a crap hand as I kept crashing the balloon. Then I got a wild, and two other colored cards in my hand. I pretended all I had was still crap, everyone bailed and I wound up coming within 2 spots of the leader and 10 spots of winning! It turned my opinion of the game around real quick. I'd love to give it another play or 3 to really get a feel for it. I think it might be my kind of game.

[$5] Good filler game. It has a push your luck element. Everything depends on whether or not the balloon pilot (which rotates each turn) has the cards with the required combination of colors. Only decision a player makes is when to bail out and claim the points earned thus far, foregoing the risk of earning more points or losing it all.

Fun and breezy game of rolling dice and trying to play cards from your hand to match them. The stakes get higher as more dice are rolled and your hands drain away. Do you jump from the balloon now and take some points, or hang in there and risk everything for a larger gain? Worth a look if you can find it now.

Push-your-luck games are not as common as I would have thought.  Given the success of Incan Gold as a brilliant family game I am always on the lookout for new variations.  Cloud 9 works well: you simply decide whether to remain in the balloon of jump out.  Push your luck too far and you'll come down with a bang and score zero.  Play it safe and you'll miss out.  You are gambling on players having, or not, certain card combinations which match the dice.  Very simple and good family entertainment.  No where nearly as strong as Incan Gold, or Can't Stop for that matter, but good nonetheless especially for a quick filler with appeal probably as young as six.

Tried the game for the first time on July 1st 2005 at a huge gamer meeting at a local school.

A game with a lot chance. I don't like that. Kind be very frustrating if you push your luck too much. 

It's very doubt full that I would replay this game any time soon to see if my opinion changes. 

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

Nice push-your-luck game with a bluffing element. But subject to luck-of-the-draw issues and card hoarding. The push-your-luck element can also be broken if no one jumps out of the balloon, giving the starting player more incentive to crash it.

Although I think I prefer Diamant (both games are push your luck/ risk management), Cloud 9 offers a fun twist in the genre.  The ability to bluff in this game, interestingly, can hinder or help the experience depending on the players involved.

(November 2011) We had a copy of the original game, in the larger box, and played it a couple of times. It did not go over particularly well with the family. A couple of years ago, I won a copy of the 2004 edition in a random drawing. Once we tried it again, it became a popular game for our game days. It is a simple game to learn, plays quickly, and is excellent for family gaming. I think it will come out every now and then for our game days.

2013-November:  This gets selected for game days now and then. It's a very good push your luck game.

A fun little filler game with great bits. Similar in a push-your-luck way to Diamant, but in my opinion has more tactical possibilities.

In Cloud 9 one of the players will be the pilot. The crucial question is whether this player has the cards to take the balloon to the next level. He may be bluffing you that he has the cards, to take you down with him and deny you the points (the pilot cannot jump out this turn), or he may be bluffing you that he doesn't have the cards, to make you jump out and take fewer points than if you stayed in the balloon. 

The second consideration in Cloud 9 is the way the pilot succession changes. If the player who was going to be the next pilot jumps out then a different player becomes the next pilot. If *that* player doesn't have the cards to pilot the balloon during his turn he will have to jump out too. By watching the other players you begin to get a feel (or not!) for the current balloon trip and the next one. 

If the player who is to be the next pilot chooses to stay in the balloon when he could have jumped out you may take this as an indication that he must have the cards for his turn...but he may be planning to deliberately crash the balloon, especially if he is in the lead, just to deny points to other players. 

A great value little game, provided you want a fun filler with layer interaction.

Not a deep game by any stretch, but the kids got into it. Out of the Box version has nifty balloon basket, and board and cards are plastic coated, so it should be nearly indestructable. A big plus with kids playing it.

Sat on the shelf for a long time un-opened. I'm not sure what kind of plastic the bits are made of, but they'd produced a hellish odor. Not too bad after it aired out a while, but not a pleasant surprise.

Cloud 9 is short and lighthearted with not much skill involved.  It is similar to Pass the Pigs in its strategy - if you're behind you need to take more chances to catch up and if you're in front you need to just defend to solidify your lead.  A fun game to lighten up between more serious games.  Perhaps it would be good for children as well as intellectually overtaxed adults.  A great way to end an evening on a positive, light note.

A very light push-yer luck gambling game, in which players take it in turns to pilot a hot-air balloon, gambling that they can match symbols on the dice with cards from their hand... players can opt to jump out and score lower points, or stick with the pilot and hope to score big.. but your turn at piloting will soon come round, and you can't jump out if you're the pilot.

Cloud 9 is a light push-your-luck filler with the theme of riding in a hot air balloon. Players will decide when to bail out of the balloon basket as it climbs higher and higher, scoring more points when the leave the higher the basket is. If they wait too long, they will find the balloon plummeting to the earth and score no points. Then everyone gets back in and starts again. Thematically, this is fairly nonsensical, yet as a mnemonic it works very well. Players immediately recognize their goal and see how they can achieve it.

The components are bright and cheery and the balloon basket looks great, though some have commented that the lack of an actual balloon makes it look a little silly. I especially like the "invisible" plastic stand that gives the basket the appearance of floating above the table.

Unfortunately, the gameplay leaves something to be desired, especially in a field crowded with contenders such as Diamant, No Thanks!, Duck Duck Bruce, and most of the "roll-three-times" dice games. Rather than analyzing the odds on the dice or reacting to the cards in your hand, most of the risk you take is in the hands of the other players. Most of the time, you take your best guess as to what cards they have. The rest of the time, your skills in memorization are all that will set you apart from the competition. 

It's easy to be drawn in by the look and feel of this game. It's thrilling to watch the basket rise and fall. But it just doesn't have legs. There is never anything new to figure out and each game feels very much the same. This sameness combined with the strong luck element generally makes me wish I was playing a similar but better game. And many of those exist.

Probably the most fun press your luck dice game I've ever played. Unlike Pass the Pigs and Pickomino, it's always engaging and it pays to pay attention to what's going on, even if you've already jumped out of the balloon.

This is a good, solid, light filler for up to six players. Plays quickly, with very little downtime and interesting "push your luck" mechanism, with a similar feel to Incan Gold. It may make for an excellent party gateway for non-gamers, while still keeping it interesting for veteran gamers.

After seeing that the designer is Aaron Weissblum, the other half of the notable Alan R. Moon and Aaron Weissblum partnership (San Marco, Oasis, 10 Days in series), it is easy to discern Weissblum's trademark knack for presenting players with playfully intense, psychological dilemmas in most of his games. This is a solid "7". I believe this game will/does have a wider audience, far beyond the Geek.

In short, it's a great game for small groups. Very light game play. A lot of chance, a bit of gambling, with a dash of card counting. Every player gets involved. Great if your group is having a couple drinks. HIGHLY recommend this. Takes anywhere between 10-25 minutes depending on how many players you have. 

The game rotates with each player taking a turn piloting a hot air balloon with the other players as passengers. Each player has six cards to start; ranging in any of 4 colours or a rare wildcard. Each "turn" as pilot starts with all players in the balloon on cloud one, where the pilot rolls 2 dice. The passengers gamble as to whether the pilot has the combination of cards that were rolled (I.e. 2 red cards if 2 reds come up on the dice). If you think the pilot has the cards you stay in; if not, you jump out and collect points based on how high off the ground you are. IF the pilot doesn't have the cards, the balloon crashes with everyone who was still in, and collects no points. Everyone draws a card, gets back in the balloon, and the next player becomes pilot. Repeat until one(or more) players get 50 points.

TLDR: one of the best light'ish-weight games we've ever picked up. BEST with 6, good with 4.

A classic Press Your Luck game. Cloud 9 provides tight tension between the host and the guests. The more you trust the host, the more your get. It can be described high risk and high reture in economics. Because of the card system, the host has more advantages than the guests. Card luck is very important part. It is a nice party game anyway.

After the first few plays, we realized we were playing it slightly wrong (we tried what I'll call a variant, where a single player piloted the balloon for an entire round) but still fun. A good light (depth) game.

RATING: 8
This is a great game that has an interesting concept different from almost all others.  Everybody is involved in every turn, and decisions are made BEFORE cards are revealed.  
My kids were 6 and 8 when we got the game and they both picked it up immediately and really enjoyed it.  We've played it about 15 times.  It's a game we'll play about once every six months or so.

Some notes:
~The artwork is kinda cheesy, but whatever
~The "rush" you get when you make it to Cloud9 is pretty cool...it doesn't happen very often
~Although the novelty has worn off, it's still a game we play from time to time and, once we bring it out, it's hard to only play once; usually we play 2 or 3 games.

Very easy to learn the mechanics and fairly quick, so perhaps might be good for people that don't play games much. A little too much reliance on reading the other players, rather than the game itself, (for my taste) from memory fairly entertaining though.

Less irritating to me than most fillers, and there's actually a little skill in knowing when to stay in the balloon and when to bail.  If I really cared enough to make a serious game out of this I'd take out the wild cards, which hand a large advantage to the player who draws them.

Very accessible to non-gamers.  Uprating to 6 for that reason.  I don't think I'd want to waste time playing this with gamers though.  Maybe before RFTG and Dominion came out, but not anymore.

This game is simple and fun.  Roll the dice, press your luck and hope you can make it to the next level.  If you don't believe the pilot can get you more points, jump out.  I like that the pilot is stuck flying if at least one other person sticks with them.  I think that's really the hook to this for me.  Plus, it's super quick.  Everyone in the gaming group loved this one.

RATING: 6
A push-your-luck game where you guess whether or not a player can play cards from their hand to match the dice that the player has rolled. Everyone travels together but makes decisions individually whether or not the player can play the cards. You either take the points for the distance you've traveled or bet that the player can play the cards and push it further for more points. If you are wrong, you get no points. If you successfully push it a long way, you can get halfway to winning on a single play.

There is a bit of subtlety here in when you jump vs. when it is your turn to "pilot" (ie. roll the dice). The airship is cool and the game has a unique look. It is fine. Something I would play, but nothing I need to own. Very hard to catch up if you fall behind.

This game was reprinted last year as Celestia, adding special action "power cards". I can't for the life of me imagine how that would improve the game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7

Quick-playing filler type game with quite a bit of player interaction as everyone needs to decide whether or not the pilot can keep the balloon aloft, all while worrying about having the necessary cards during their next turn as pilot.  Along with Can't Stop and Cheeky Monkey (the 3 C's in my book), best of the quick filler, push-your-luck type games.

An interesting contrast to Incan Gold where being the pilot affects your decision to stay or jump. This is one of the few games that I play with a house rule because I believe making a Wild Card optional is extremely broken and gives too much power to the person who is lucky enough to draw one. I teach it that the wild must also move up the boat under any circumstance

Everyone places their passenger token into the balloon's basket to start the trip, and receives a hand of six balloon cards. Then, each turn, a different "pilot" rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud. Everyone hops aboard and draws one new card, and the next trip begins. When a player earns 50 points the game is over.

The game is based around 1 mechanic. I can be fun, but it purely a guess.

Sometimes you can have some piece of information if last time that played failed to respond to a color else it's pure guess.

There is too much blankc on the dices. Which makes some rolls pretty easy and obvious.

I would have placed more wild cards or additional special cards so that there could be a decision to be done by the driver when he does not have the appropriate colors. Else, being a driver is a huge disadvantage.

A push your luck type game where you attempt to decipher if the balloon pilot has and will play the necessary cards as mandated by 2, 3, or 4 dice rolled.  Jump from the balloon and gain the points underneath or push your luck and see if you can continue to gain more points by seeing the balloon go higher.  One play and the ending was very anticlimatic as I was out of yellow cards, the leader only needed two points to win so he jumped off the balloon before I crashed the balloon...and poof, the game was done and no one else was even able to contend.  Seems like you can play with 7 players with no issues if you use coins or something...

Takes 2 mins to explain to even children.  Nicely produced and is likely one of the best bargains in gaming considering the quality of the bits.  The board is exemplary.  My main nit is the length of play.  It's longer than advertised in our household.

I've only played Cloud 9 twice but it was a disappointment especially with the new rules where they kept the brain intact but cut out the heart. The original FX Schmid rules contained bluffing, catch-up mechanisms, card combos and the Pass The Barn card (pass the pilot duties to the next player). Out of the Box should have kept these rules as an advanced variant. Either way I thought there was just too much guessing unless you're a card-counter thus making it a memory game. It just seemed like a game of statistics with imperfect information. I think I had a tough time because you're betting on what other players can do but have no influence over their play.

Great light game of pushing a bid to the limits.  Balloon goes up, and you either trust the captain to go higher or jump out and cut your losses.  It's light, it's colorful, it's quick, and it's fun -- a very good quasi-filler.

Players see how high they can go in a hot air balloon in this game of chicken. It's a "push-your-luck" type game similar to "Diamant." It's easy to explain, fun and quick to play. 

The only real downside is that people seem to rather play "Diamant" more than this game because it's more exciting. I'm sure the shiny gems in "Diamant" also help sway people as well.

Got this game to play with my entering third-grade daughter, and it worked out well.  Honestly, I think the plastic balloon basket turns a 4 rating into a 5.  Game companies take note!  Without that little piece of production, I don't think this game would have gotten nearly the play that it has.  I've played this with lots of third graders, boys and girls, and it has never failed to produce a good time.  I've had older kids join in, too, but from my experience the sweet spot for this game is second to fourth graders.  Set up to play is about 1 minute.  Explaining the rules takes 5 minutes.  A game takes 15 - 20 minutes.  As an adult you can't help but wonder "Why do you get points for jumping out of a balloon," but hey, enough questions, just roll the dice already!

First impression: Out of the Box -version is a overproduced but I have to say I like that little rubbery balloon basket. The theme is fun as well as playing especially when people have to make painful decisions whether to bail out now or not. Needs 5-6 players to make game exciting.

I use rules from 1. edition when playing. That is catchup mechanic and I've marked four balloon cards to be able to play with rule that you can give control of balloon to another player. Those rules add fun of the game and doesn't hurt gameplay too much as there is quite a bit of luck involved anyway. I also play such that once you need to show your cards you draw as many new ones and dicard your previous hand.

I don't know why this game doesn't ever seem to go over as well as Dimante. It's pretty, has a fun theme, and doesn't try to be anything more than a simple, light-hearted, push-your-luck game. Nevertheless, I've consistently gotten better results/reactions with other PYL games.

Got this for the kids. It's not very much fun, since it's actually difficult to keep the ballon aloft with a small number of players (we usually play with 3). I may have to add some new rules to spice this one up for us.

Definitely more fun with more players.  A colourful, visually appealing game with nice wooden playing pieces and an ultra-cool basket for them to jump out of.

Each turn you get a binary choice whether to jump (and bank some points), or hold out for more points, but you score 0 if the current player doesn't have the right colour cards in hand (dealt randomly). The only element of skill is remembering who didn't have the right cards on previous rounds, but new cards get dealt each round so all you're doing is guesstimating the odds. Nothing interesting here.

Another rainy experience, but at least it has a theme, be it so light, airy and fluffily pasted on as to not be there. Roll some dice. If you don't think the roller can match the dice with their cards, bale out of the hot air balloon and score points. Otherwise, hang on for the ride and hopefully get more points after the next roll. Yay, he matches. Next player rolls. Don't think he can match it? Bale out, score points. If you think he can, but he can't, uh oh (in your best Teletubbies voice), no points. Up and up. Down. Up and up. Down.

The decision making is mindless guesswork because you're given no indication on what players have in their cards except for what they could or couldn't play last time. And even then, they may have picked up several cards since then.

There are funner dice games. I really should submit funner to Websters, Oxford and Macquarie.

You'd actually have a big advantage in this game if you could remember what your opponents said they didn't have, but I'm not sure anyone puts that much thought into it.  In any case, this one is inoffensive, but there are definitely push-your-luck games that I find more engaging.

Fine light filler, better with more people. A very modest amount of tactical play and "reading" people that rests almost wholly on who possesses a wild card.  I prefer to play without wild cards for that reason.  Random card draw can lead to some obnoxious rolling moments (like when you never draw a red balloon and roll a red balloon four straight times and can't raise the balloon despite having 18 cards in your hand not like this has happened to me or anything).

RATING: 8
Simple filler that involves basic bluffing & risk-taking.

In a similar way to For Sale, this is easily explained, plays very quickly and always goes down well with groups of up to 6 new gamers.

NOTE: Newest edition has different (slightly simpler) rules, and some components are different - meaning it can't be played with all the old rules. e.g. some cards absent, board is missing certain special spaces on scoring track.

WARNING: Sometimes there don't appear to be enough cards when playing with the full complement of 6 players, leading to constant reshuffling of the discards.

WARNING: Very bad experience with both quality of game components & customer service. The cards in this game are all stuck together when new. First copy of game had a damaged/torn card - rather than simply send out a replacement card, the publisher insisted on returning the entire game via retailer/importer/distributor for a replacement (which had to be specially ordered in). The replacement game had another damaged card (luckily not visible on the back). The board in both cases had lumps on the back, and awful wrinkles in the protective coating layer.

RATING: 6
As with the Ra re-issue (Razzia), the Cloud 9 re-release has had some elements removed from the original to allow more certain probability assessment with no undermining and so a more palatable experience. No more pilot switch cards which could be used to leapfrog or target the leader but added too much subtlety and nastiness. The 'honest play' rule can force the powerful wild cards out prematurely due to a bad die roll; no more subtle lying confusing the experience, it's now all about probability and some risk of paying for the dice rolled. There is scope for some simple bluffing, though I feel the gameplay verbally and mentally repetitive, and I find that having an unbalanced spread of a few colours can unfairly make being a pilot too risky an option: maybe there should be a house rule that 3 of a kind can be used as a wild (which I'm sure was a rule in the original release). I thinking of introducing a draft of cards to overcome bad card drawa as well as adding some much needed information. More socially interactive than Montgolfiere, but the jumping out and sitting out of rounds and the scoring resolution makes Cloud 9 hover below Monty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6

This is a fairly entertaining party game and not a brain intensive one, so don't take the scores seriously. A combination of card tracking and counting, simple odds calculations, a press-your-luck element, and a good dose of luck are needed to do well at this simple and quick game. Decisions are often pretty simple (none or only one card is needed to move up the balloon) or at best are driven by educated guess, since the available information is very sparse and rarely sufficient to make decisions with high odds of accuracy.
Overall a decent party game.

Great little push your luck game.  I was skeptical after not enjoying Diamant (which is a game in the same genre) but really had fun.  You can track what cards other players have and get an idea of how far you should push your luck.  But the more people on a balloon the more less likely you are to ascend so you don't want to let others run away with it.  Alas the game gets old pretty quick.

Cloud 9 has been a lot of fun to play, but we have only played the game with variants. Without them, I don't think the game would be as exciting or fair.

This is a great light-hearted little game.  It's one of our favorite fillers.  There's a hint of strategy and a gut-check / press your luck component.  Best with 5 or 6 players.  And even better when you yell "BOOM!" when to balloon crashes.

RATING: 5
Silly push your luck game where players decide if the pilot can match cards to symbols rolled on the dice. Has typical runaway leader effects if one player manages to get high up on the scoring. 

Great components but rules has some holes.

A few plays in and it's a very light press-your-luck game, and the theme works well with parties. You can explain the rules in 1 minute, so switching players in and out makes it a breeze. Rating based on these attributes and the simple gaming "experience" for players, than the actual game play. Nice components help "sell" the game for non-gamers.

A very basic but very fun Push your luck style game where one player rolls some dice and hopes he has the cards shown but everyone can bail if they don't believe he does before he reveals. One of my goto games for something lite and handles up to 6 players.

RATING: 8
This game reminds me of what it would feel like to know someone that won gold in the special Olympics.  That strange mixed emotion of joy in sharing the accomplishment, amazement at its kookiness and wondering if you could have done it yourself.  

The FX Schmidt version is just out of control.  Passing the Barn?  
What?  
Jumping out of the balloon to catch crystals with your umbrella?  
What?  
Drugs and Alcohol were not ruled out.  

Regardless, it is a wonderful light fun filler and with more plays (which I expect) the rating may even go up.  I picked up the Out of the Box version (used, of course, as I don't support them) and while it doesn't look as goofy and fun graphically, the components look incredible. 
 
I'm not sure why they took the Barn Cards out, along with the rule for melds. The game drastically suffers without this element.  FYI -- 3 of a kind are a wild for one card, 4 you can jump the barn, 5 is umbrella and push someone out.  

UPDATE: Yes, this is quite fun, the more I play this the more I find it rewards with fun.  The rating keeps going up.  One of the best fillers. Really, please use the old rules!!

RATING: 7.5
A bit of a press-your-luck game, as the longer the flight goes, the harder it is to keep it going.  There's a significant memory element in remembering what others have in order to jump out at strategic points.  A quality short game, although nothing phenomenal - seems like it's a good value as it's not too expensive.

UPDATE: Played again for the first time in a long while, and while not amazing, I have to say that I really enjoyed it and think this is a quality title.

Was enjoying this very much (the original edition) for a number of games until rules problems overwhelmed the fun.  Wish I could remember the "wrong" rules we enjoyed so much.

RATING: 6
[Out of the box 2004 edition] {Balloon, filler; luck-pressing, bluffing, roll-and-move; optimal 5-6p} A 'press your luck' game with little bluffing (even in English rules). It'd be even more enjoyable if bluffing is officially allowed (like in German rules). Cloud 9 is a hilarious party game. The balloon basket and the pawns are attractive and of good quality. This game is a bargain, less than USD10. Out of the box is really good at producing inexpensive party game. 

Cloud 9 has run-away leader problem. Leader with 35 points or more can easily win the game because he can choose to stay in the basket as long as possible. The other problem is the 'Wild' card is very powerful. If one player has a few of 'Wild' cards, he can easily win the game. It may be good to substitute 'Wild' card for only one color but the whole hand.

[House rule] bluffing is allowed. Player can lie and refuse to play cards. Players may challenge if they suspect a player is lying: if they are correct, the pilot drops off the balloon without points and the trip continues; if they are wrong, the pilot gets 5 points and the challenger loses 5 points (lowest 0).

Nice, light push-your-luck game. This does have a memory component (it's pretty essential to rememember which color cards your opponents are running short on), but it's a fairly small element of the game and doesn't put me off the way many memory-driven games do. An engaging, light-weight game that's definitely worth a try.

Among press-your-luck fillers, Cloud 9 is less famous than Incan Gold but it is the more interesting title.  Thanks to the player's ability to withhold cloud support via a wild card, there is more control here and the whole affair feels more strategic than Incan Gold's dramatic cave card flip.

RATING: 8
Beautiful and Fun.  

Plays well with a wide range of ages.
 
I prefer it to Incan Gold because of the components and because it is more fun to roll dice (Cloud 9 has beautiful specialty dice) than lay cards.

The more people the better.

Because the game costs around $10 there is no reason not to have this one in your collection.

Update: Rating went down from 9 to 8. I think this has more to do with an overly enthusiastic original rating than any flaws in the game or lack of interest on my part.  It may also be that Can't Stop has also come into my collection.

I still can't believe how inexpensive this game is.  The components really are top-notch.

Update: Still an 8 as this is the best pure press-your-luck game I've played. Can't Stop certainly gives it a run and it is actually more raucous and fun when it gets going, but I have experienced too many times when it just never got going. Plus Cloud 9 plays up to 6 which is a far better number for this type of game.

Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4

Players earn points by daring to stay in the basket of a hot air balloon as it rises. Points increase as the balloon climbs from cloud to cloud, but so does the risk of the balloon falling. Should you jump out to save your points or trust that the pilot will take you safely higher?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great light game.  Lots of ups and downs (pun intended).  ;)  It's basically a gambling game.  On each turn you decide if you want to stay in the balloon for more points or jump out to keep the current point level.  The higher you go, the more it's worth, but the higher the risk.  If the balloon fails, you get nothing.  It's very simple and fast.

I also recently played Can't Stop for the first time.  I can't help but comment on the similarity.  Can't stop is more strategic, but Cloud 9 has a subtle social aspect to it that appeals to me.  If the person to your left is the pilot, then you get to decide last if you are jumping out.  If everyone else is staying, then I am more inclined to stay as well because if we all fall, then no-one benefits.  If the pilot is on your right, then you need to decide what everyone else is going to do and also decide if you can pull of the piloting yourself on the next turn.  I enjoy this additional aspect more than the pure numbers game of Can't Stop.

While the theme of Cloud 9 is paper thin, I still think it adds a touch to the game.  Perhaps it should have been a shipwreck theme because one person deciding to jump can trigger the rest of the players to lose their nerve too.  It is sometimes like rats leaving a sinking ship with the poor pilot left behind.  For some reason it amuses me when that happens, especially when I'm the poor "fool" left behind, and I have a wildcard to guarantee my next roll.  :)

Push your luck game that is very simple and very light.  With the rules as written, it has some serious issues.  There's too much incentive to just crash the balloon when it's your turn and let some other sucker start the climb to the top.  And you can't jump out when somebody else starts it, as that will mean they definitely play it, and then you'll be left in the cold with only 1 point.  Now, if there was some kind of compulsory play on the first couple clouds, or if there was a more interesting choice to jump out on the first round, then it might help.  But gamers will break this game.  And what the hell is up with the theme?  You try to wait until the balloon is as high as it can get and then jump?  What are we, lemmings looking to suicide?

Like many other press your luck games, this suffers from the fact that all players are pressing their luck together on the same voyage, which makes it very difficult to catch up once you are behind and basically reduces your decision space to "always risk".

Mechanics are pure "push your luck" with one twist -- when you're in control, you cannot take the decision to profit: based solely on the game, I'd rate this game higher. What drags this down is the very poorly conceived components. Why spend all that money on a silly plastic balloon basket that serves no real game purpose and give us thinly laminated cards and cheaply made wooden dice? After a single play, the paint on my dice is flaking off in a severe way. Feh. Publishers: please make sure your essential components are good quality before you start spending more money on chrome!

Out of the Box version.  Not too bad as a light filler.  Good bang:buck ratio.  Cards seem rather flimsy.

One of those games that, left to my own devices, I would never play. But my kids love it, and I can see that it has a fun little spark. Still searching for my ideal "push your luck" game, though (or perhaps I should just realize it's not a genre that appeals).

I like this game, it's fast, it's fun, and  fills time. Playable with non gamers.

Nice party filler game.  A press your luck game along the lines of Can't Stop.

A good filler game, but not much more.  It is basically a guessing game, with a little bit of odds based upon what cards you have in your hands and what the pilot has done before.

A simple press-your-luck game that has dice-chucking and some light card-counting. Cute enough for what it is.

Another fun, light family and friends game.  Kids like this one too, but my 7 yo gets a bit antsy - she doesn't like to press her luck.

Update: Rating goes up because my then 7 yo is now 9 and likes it a lot.  Her rating.

One of the best gateway games that I know.  Many gamers will shy away, but that's just because they're scared of heights and hot air ninjas.

A good bluffing, push your luck filler game. Nothing great but solid enough.

Played a few times (with 5-6 players). An interesting push-your-luck game which lead to animated and noisy sessions. The joker cards might be too powerful, I would consider having them replace any one (but only one) balloon next time I play.

Played OotB edition, 2006.  I'd have given this a 1, but you do in some sense make things resembling decisions, even if they are basically just guesses and you have no real control of being in the game.  If the old version was better, it's a shame they changed it.  Probably fun for kids (young ones), but if they can play this, then I'd guess they can play something better.

I should learn from my past mistakes in 'press your luck' games, but I don't, and I fail.  Very entertaining game.

Terrific "push your luck" game that has a feel of Can't Stop would a good deal of groupthink. Even young kids can make meaningful decisions and have fun. This is my kind of game. Thanks, Aaron!

RATING: 6.5
Harmless, light and fluffy filler fun. A bit of card counting and risk management is all the decision making there is to find in this breezy push your luck game. Quick pace, ultra-easy rules and a light theme work well. [UPDATE] This is a poor man's version of Diamant. Both games offer similar experiences, but far more lies out of your control in Cloud 9 by virtue of the dice.

Nice, sturdy cards, but the long game board is one of the most horribly warped monstrosities I've ever seen -- with so many pronounced folds and backfolds, it never lays flat, so the scoring markers slide all over the place.

Found it a little dull.  Maybe with more than 3...

Edit: Much better with more players, but still not really my cup of tea...

Fun concept but awfully repetitive, especially having to ask people if they want to stay or bail for the 100th time.  One play is enough for me.

This is a pretty decent press-your-luck kind of game.  Nothing too fancy, nothing too engrossing.  As light as the air the balloon travels through.

Just played it with two players to test it out - and it was a barrel of laughs rolled up in a blanket of good times. Can't wait to play with more. Update: played another 9 times since then with more players. Awesome fun.

I prefer this over [thing=37759][/thing] in the sheer push-your-luck category, because you're all in it together, and working from a hand of cards.

Good game that we play a lot, alternates in our sessions with diamant , same type of game , just slightly different aspect to the prediction of whether to stay or jump..

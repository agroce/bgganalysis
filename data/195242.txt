Very simple game mechanics that allow quick, fun and surprisingly tense gaming. Initially feels like X Wing but once playing opens up to be more. Looking forward to seeing this develop.

Got this to play with my 8yr old. Pretty simplistic but quick playing and some fun in putting the kits together. Base game is pretty good value compared to buying vehicles on their own. Easily adaptable to use larger scale models though.

Initial Impression: The components in this game are wonderfully produced. In particular, I love the tank models. This game is similar in nature to X-Wing with a point system that allows for army customization. Unfortunately, that's where my love for the game ends. Similar to XWing, initiative levels force the highest levels to move last and fire first. But herein lies what I perceive to be the fatal flaw with this game. Without plotted movement, units that are consistently faster can react flexibly to their opponents. This means that the slower tanks will almost never outmaneuver their faster opponents and might as well abandon that tactic. In the end the game will devolve into a dice chuck as units will become static and simply trade shots. Not my idea of a fun time.

Jeu très simple même simpliste.
Il ne recrée absolument pas l'ambiance de la seconde guerre mondiale.
A éviter!

It does a lot of things right and scratches a lot of itches at the same time. Great value for money. Might need a couple of house rules to add some extras.

Skirmishing miniature combat game. Very light and rather random. More random and light than X-Wing. It has to be compared with X-Wing, since it took a lot of inspiration from this game. I prefer the movement mechanic of X-Wing. If I play a skirmisher with basically free and alternating movement I would prefer other games (e.g. Warmachine).

Great miniature skirmish game for tanks in WWII.  The models are well made and the rules are well written.  Game play is quick and the action is furious.

Miniatures are nicely done. It's meant to be a game first. Probably has a better chance at getting played at a games meet than 'serious' hex and counter.

RATING: 7
Very light, X-Wing inspired game.  Fun, fast, and furious. I may buy into it more as it's a pretty good time.

Downsides are that you have to assemble minis (not too much of a hassle if you've ever assembled plastic model kits), and that it may not have the longevity of X-Wing due to a lack of depth.

Fun little game.
Not very detailed, not very deep, but solid enough for a quick game or two. Though I recommend keeping it to 50 or maybe 60 points max - we tried a 3-player free-for-all with 100 points each and it took quite a long time to finish the game.

Always liked tanks, this game hits the spot for me. Looks like X-Wing but to me is better for quick games. The mechanics are designed for easy and fast play, definitely not as a tank battle simulation.

It is a very fun light war game (especially fun if you love WW2 and TANKS). I consider it to be a lighter version of Flames of War (also an excellent game - just a tougher learning curve).

RATING: 6.5
A very good and fast tank skirmish game.  While not everything is entirely realistic, the game is fairly light and easy to learn.  The selection of tanks is pretty good and grows more as time goes on.

The movement rules are a bit wonky to get the hang of, but keep the game from being overly complicated.  I wish there was a bit more variety in the weaponry to make things feel more realistic at times, but again it is the way it is to keep the flow of games fast and balanced.

The game is fun and fast. It is okay at low tank counts but I can see this game scaling up really well to large amounts of tanks. Yes, it is very much X-Wing and World of Tanks rolled into a tabletop game but the removal of the planning phase and actions boils the game right down to move/shoot and little in the way. The dice are the major deciding difference but for the speed of play you can have a couple of games while waiting for everyone to arrive and then afterwards as a wrap up. It's great to have a filler game in miniature form.

Yes this game is light and can even be a bit random but it's fast and fun and scratches the miniature itch without breaking the bank or requiring deep study of complex rules. 

I prefer this to Xwing and would consider it on par with wings of war. I hope they don't focus too much on tournament play but bring out new rules and scenarios to improve the storytelling.

Meh, similar to X-Wing (But more streamlined rules), Wings of War/Glory and Sails of Glory EXCEPT this series has no pre-painted, assembled miniatures - a FATAL FLAW! 

Just play the World of Tanks online game on the PC - virtually similar and no need to paint the tanks (This board game, you need to assemble & paint - gloss coat/primer, airbrush, decal/ink wash, etc. Arrgh, too much work for each tank model!).

Fun game.  Fast play.....X-Wing mechanics come to the WW2 battlefield.  Our gaming group has been playing a lot of this lately and we are enjoying it.  This is not a game for the rivet counters or lovers of the complex.  This game should take about an hour to play with 100 pts per side.  I find scenarios with 2 objectives in the middle third of the table....one placed by each side....to be ideal to make this game play well.

Not a bad little tank version of X-Wing. Plays fast and the miniatures are decent quality. My only qualm was that movement seemed much too simplified. I think that one would need to add lots of expansions to keep this from getting repetitive and boring. But for only $20 MSRP how can you go wrong.

Another great entry level miniatures game that focuses solely on tank combat.  You'll build your crew out and then maneuver to take shots at each other.  The card results throw some nice variety into what would otherwise be nothing more than a move-and-shoot game.  It has sandbox elements to it where you can play on any terrain mat you like, and if you have any of the AA:Miniatures (later models) they're the same size and can be proxied for those in the game so you don't need to assemble them.  I'd put this release in the same category as this year's Airfix Battles.  This one plans to have a lot of future expansions with more tanks, battlemat's, and more cards.

A tank game for X wing players. Gradually batter down hit points damage model and free form sideways movement seems possible. Great for space combat fans, but avoid if you've ever read any history.

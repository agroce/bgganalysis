You want space combat in a boardgame, you must have this.  

The mechanics are very good but if there's a weakness it's that the time-scale seems too large;  ships can move quite far on the map so it really comes down to initiative...fortunately, that's driven by pilot skill so at least its handled thematically.

The damage model is simple but interesting and effective given the spirit of the game.  Wonder if it'd be even better if it borrowed the damage model from Full Thrust?

Another good space battle game that, despite having decent rules and mechanics, does not get played anymore.

One of my favorite games due to the Damage Track mechanism, ease and speed of play, and inexpensive costs to get into it. So fun when you're in a sci-fi mood.

Fast and furious space combat, which can be slightly marred by the odd lucky player constantly winning the initiative. Still, a refreshing blast compared with the ponderous book-keeping of Star Fleet Battles.

I only played this a couple of times, and don't remember all that much about it except for the kind of cute mechanic of saying "your ship is better at whatever, so it gets a d10 instead of a d6," etc.  Maybe I'll check it out again someday...

I miss games like this. Silent Death had a wonderfully simple and intuitive mechanism for determining the effects of ships' fire, and hit a great sweet-spot between being lightweight enough to just pick up and play and yet crunchy enough to provide a lot of tactical options. The models were really great as well, though much less so in this edition. Unfortunately ship balance was a bit hit or miss, similar to with Battletech, so we ended up using a drafting approach when choosing ships for games.

One of the best space fighter games ever done. "The Starfleet Battles of fighters"

I have several copies of this title, it is by far the best Sci-Fi starfighter combat game ever printed. Iron Crown was a great game publisher and it showed in their product. I created a Star Wars cover of almost all the ships from the films and novels. The system is unique and very much fun. The ship design system is also very easy to use.

This is probably one of the best space games I have ever played.  Granted large battles can take awhile but for a fast fun evening of gaming a fly to you die is great fun.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite space dogfighting games. The damage track is what attracted me to this game. The sensation of trying to hold my battered starfighter together while trying to maneuver into a good firing position puts me right into the middle of the action like any good sci-fi space movie would. Playing time depends on number of ships involved. Rules range from simple to more time-consuming if the optional advanced rules and gear are used.

Can't believe this game gets a 5.9 rating. My favorite space game. A nice blend of mechanics, miniatures, and cool ship designs. I do play with many of the alternate rules made for the game for more complexity; however, I haven't played with realistic vectored movement for a vacume yet.

The copies that I.C.E. are now (2009) sending out no longer seem complete. For instance mine did not have a full complement of ships or any markers for torpedoes/asteroids etc. Did have lots o' dice and all the rules and charts though.

Old skool space combat. Can be slow to grasp and requires multiple players for big battles. Very rewarding for those who like flight sim style space combat.

I keep reading good things about this game and it's the only space combat game that any geek has ever claimed to be his "desert island" game.  There has to be at least one good rule in there!

Looking forward to the Deluxe Box Set being back in-stock at ICE.

Recently found pair of Silent Death prize minis from late 1990s or early 2000's.
At that time I was healthy enough and good enough to decide which place I wanted to win at the Skirmishes con which was in Kansas City, Missouri, in that era. These dolphin or porpoise styled ships were the second place prize and I like them better than the 1st and 3rd prizes. 
Painted them in a substantially more saturated version of a couple breeds that I would now have to go look in book what they are.
tried painting bases to look like ocean from high altitude but I have always sucked at painting water, on minis, on canvas, and with watercolor, and Dad was in the Navy and we canoed a lot, so you'd think I could paint water!

RATING: 6
Unbalanced, clunky, very very ameritrash, very 1990 battletech esque, but still a very cool car wars in space game with an extensive rpg level world building behind it. Looking back at it now, I can tell why Iron Crown Enterprises went out of business with the games they where publishing.


6 is too high of a rating for this one, but it was one of my first hobby games when I was in High School so nostalgia takes it from a 4 or 5 to 6.

Great space minis game. I had the box set back in 1995 when it came out. Sold it. Now I have the PDFs from Metal Express.

RATING: 10
Easy to learn rules but with some nice depth.  In particular, some really clever thinking went into the streamlining of the combat rules, giving some impressively detailed combat results with a minimum of dice rolls.  Plays fast, but you can add on as many of their offered optional rules as you wish to complicate things up nicely.  

Probably one of the BEST starfighter combat games out there.  For me, it's always felt very "Star Warsy" in its 2-D presentation of starfighters streaking around at full throttle with weapons blazing and with pilots desperately wrenching at their controls in a vain attempt to twist out of the way of that incoming flight of torpedoes.  

And where it differs from Star Wars in its importance placed on torpedoes and missiles, it makes up for it in sheer variety of ships from which to pick.  There are so many sourcebooks available for this game full of more and more fighters and even some smaller not-quite-capital sized ships, that it can be hard to keep track of them all.

Great game.

THE space fighter game. The re-imputation was as good as the original. I used to run this at conventions. Novices had no problem with picking it up even if they had no gaming experience.

Relatively simple game, but plays fast and plenty of room for maneuvering around.  I like how taking damage affects your ship, but does this in a manner that is very easy to use.

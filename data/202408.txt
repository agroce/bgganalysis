Managed to get this played the day I bought it and everyone had a blast. Hope it's not just a case of being dazzled by all the fun options the first time round. 

It's just fun in a box, you'll be hard pressed to find another game that's Euro at the core yet presents itself this well and gives you such excitement playing it. The theme makes this game sing. I could see AP dragging it down; it's supposed to be 60 mins, so choose the group wisely!

update: 10 plays in, excitement has cooled but still lots of fun. Could use more weapon variety in the (upcoming!) expansion.

Apesar do que muitos dizem desse jogo, não acho possível considerá-lo um euro. Ele é um take that com pontos de ação e cubinhos para representar as armas. As mecânicas para evitar que um jogador seja perseguido são ótimas. Muito divertido.

RATING: 7
Quite fun implementation of a first-person shooter - a style of game I played during the days of the original Doom, but do not generally enjoy. I like the frantic nature of blasting, but honestly this is a very strategic game of tactical shooting, resource management and (yes) area control - where you and your opponents are the area. So very fun!

RATING: 4
Adrenaline has good promise of action it fails to deliver. The game is so slow and full of bad iconography. For instance, a change I would make is that everyone gets their selection of weapons right at the beginning without having to spend turns picking them up. Especially the time players spend pondering which tool of damage to choose is loooong. Many of the weapons are also quite unbalanced as there are some that you can only use in a handful of spaces on the board while opponents are on certain spaces as well. Why introduce such thing into the game?

Those rare seconds of action are fun for sure but there are just too few of them.

It works. It captures the feel of an FPS however I don't see why this is a particularly interesting theme or a particularly entertaining experience for that matter. There are hundreds of games I would rather play instead of this. The big plus is that it doesn't use dice for combat. For the rest it's a rather okish experience with a few sporadic moments of excitement.

RATING: 7
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Adrenaline was a very enjoyable experience. So much so that I've even considered purchasing the game for a while, even just for the idea beneath it. I've always wanted a board game that could give me the feel of a first person shooter like Halo (my favorite video game of all time) and this is the game that came the closest to that.

As far as the components are concerned, Adrenaline has some good production values. The miniatures are nice, I always liked clear cubes and even the plastic blood tokens are very high quality. However, and this is true for many CGE games, I'm really not a fan of the artwork. I find it bland and somehow able to spoil the overall look of the game in spite of its good components.

Talking about game-play instead, I enjoyed most of what this game does. I really liked going around, picking up weapons (which are all very cool and different by the way), chasing and shooting other people. I like that the designer didn't sacrifice good mechanisms for the sake of the theme. I especially enjoyed the way scoring has been handled, being almost an area majority system. It's very clever! I was less of a fan of the resource management element behind the ammos instead... I think it slowed the game down a little too much. Another minor problem I had with the game is its iconography, that forces you to look up the weapons every time. I would have much rather had a simple written description on the card of what each particular weapon does.

Generally speaking though, Adrenaline is a pretty good game. It's not really a deep one, so be careful if that's what you're looking for, but it's a great way to have some silly fun. I don't want to buy it anymore, since I'm not sure it's a game I want to play all the time, but I would definitively enjoy it from time to time.

RATING: 5
1st play: A fun, rompy area control game with shooting each other and lots of death and respawning.  Pretty cool idea and it plays really fast.  I like the variety of weapons and abilities, and trying to combo cool moves is great.  Doesn't overstay it's welcome and plays well with a variety of player counts.  The adrenaline actions are awesome but it's pretty easy to die once you get them so you don't get tired of them.

2nd play: Meh - fell pretty flat.  There isn't any penalty for dying so people just run headlong into danger.  It's a novel idea and a good attempt, just pretty boring with the actual execution.

RATING: 8
I was totally surprised by that one. An ego shooter as a boardgame?! No thanks.... But this one is actually executed really well. You can either play it highly strategic (not sure how much fun that is) or, what I prefer fro this one, just jump into combat and try to snatch kill after kill. If I remember right, dying has close to no consequences, so it really is just that. Go with the flow and bash everyone that comes close. That makes it a great game to play inbetween really heavy games or after a downer game.

RATING: 6
Adrenaline earns an extra point from me for trying to be different.  It applies euro area control mechanics to a first person shooter.  "Area control" is achieved by dealing out wound points and is assessed whenever a character is killed.  There is also some very light touch  resource management in the form of ammo that is picked up from the various locations.  My disappointment with Adrenaline is with its first person shooter element; the playing area is small and it's too easy to deal hits to pretty much whoever you want.  Death is a very temporary state, with the character immediately re-spawning.  The net result is an exercise in efficient point grabbing with none of the tension of a good shooter.  It doesn't get my adrenaline pumping.

Production quality is good.  In particular, the player character miniatures are quite nicely done.  The iconography takes a little wrapping your head around,  The artwork is forgettable, though functional.

Tried a second and third time, theme is good, components are cool, the fact you don't use dices gives you the power to win the game if you are more efficient but at the end is quite boring. After you grab two or three weapons you will perform the same actions over and over.

A really creative approach to the area majority genre. I love what they did with the theme. Don't blow this one off because its themed as a FPS arena style game.

I love area majority games. My favorite game of all time is El Grande, after all. I also love resource management, which this game introduces (granted, at a small scale, but still) via the ammo crates and their limited availability.

Plus, the game has a theme like no other, and one that brings me back to my teenage and early 20s years, fragging all my friends to oblivion.

First play: Rules are quite straight forward but everyone needs to have access to the weapons glossary so either 5 copies are required or a set of cards made up with a description per weapon. 

Nice balancing mechanisms and cool to discover that dying doesn't actually mark you down on points. Played longer than expected but that was mainly down to having to cross reference the weapon details.

As flawless a board game translation of Unreal Tournament can be. There is time to think tactically, carry out area control, and maximize points. At the same time, however, the game maintains an exciting pace as you run room to room, gathering ammo, loading up, and emptying clip after clip of ammo into your friends. Straddles the line between Euro and Amerithrash in a very fun way.

A highly tactical, very euro game of area control where the areas you are trying to control are the bullets in other players' bodies.  You pick up big weapons and run around and shoot each other, getting points for the first shot, the kill shot and the most shots when someone dies.  If you die, you respawn.  The mechanics are clever with players getting better abilities as they are shot and their adrenaline rushes. It's fun to play with eurogamers who aren't up for a game of planning.

Interesting area control game where you fight to control your opponent's HP bar. Provides compelling reasons for spreading your attention across many "areas" and for putting in more than 50% effort in some areas as well. The theme placed over the top of the game is fun too, and the ammo mechanics force you to make decisions about the "how" you use to take up space on health bars.

Adrenaline is a first person shooter euro game. That sounds weird right? Well it works fantastically. The goal is to get the most points by having the most blood tokens on an enemy when they die, with bonuses to first blood and kill shots. Every weapon is unique, and the game play is fast and simple. 

Better with higher player counts. Try this one out.

An easy hit for most gamers. It's hard to envision anyone straight up disliking Adrenaline, but it's never going to be anyone's favourite game of all time either. The lack of strategic depth JUST holds it back from it's full potential. It'll always get played and it'll always be great fun. Just make sure to play Adrenaline in short bursts ;]

I was skeptical coming into this game. I looked at the lovely models and the tokens, the game board with the cool and dark setting on it, and I thought it was going to let me down. I've been let down in the past by many games promising to hold up to their themes.

I have to take a second and say that I played a lot of shooters in my day. Unreal tournament and HALO were my go-tos as a young teen. So my hopes for this game to be good and true was high.

But in that same vein, if you didn't play any of these types of games, I think the game still stands up. But, maybe not as much as if you had. Though I wouldn't be the one to ask, I guess.

But if you have... If you have... Just give them your money and let that be the beginning of it. Believe me.

Fun game. Simple mechanics. Deceivingly enough, it's not so much an FPS but more an area control. That is fun in itself. Player elimination is not bad at all which is good too. I can see it getting a bit samey after a while. Maybe more board and more weapons would help so the game could totally have an expansion.

A nice little surprise! I'm usually not a fan of Ameritrash games but I actually enjoyed this game. Players take turns moving around the man, picking up weapons and ammunition, and trying to kill each other. There are a couple of really interesting mechanisms: as you take more damage, your abilities get better and each time you die the amount of points awarded drops so it doesn't benefit to gang up on someone. Not my favorite genre so I wouldn't play the game very often but I'm definitely willing to play every now and then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid game that yields its fun when you build devastating combos. It's quick and straight to the point which helps as well.

What keeps this game from being amazing is that it lacks substantive drama. It's about maximizing weapon/hit efficiency on your turn (which is fun) but it's not wild or crazy and individual plays aren't exceptionally memorable.

This is such a weird game - it's a "hack'n'slash" game where you're running around with your miniature in a crowded area and shooting the other characters, so it ought to elicit a lot of laughs, but the reality is that it is really a eurogame with a lot of things to consider, which can actually bog the game down when playersr try to figure out the best way to damage/kill the other players! 

This meant that my first play of this game was actually somewhat silent (broken by the occasional curses!), and the mechanics and theme didn't mesh well at all! 

Also, every player needs to be careful about which person to shoot due to the scoring system, so it's very bad to e.g. do a lot of damage but not kill the person off, and that did happen a couple of times in our play, which was a shame. There are lots of different weapons, so the first couple of times you will always have to ask "what does this weapon do", which again causes some downtime and detracts from the overall gaming experience.

Probably the best board game version of a first person shooter I've played, and that's not saying too much.

Definitely something worth trying, but may not have much staying power.

Love the card art for the weaponry. The gameplay mechanics... I'm not quite sold on. A Euro resource management/area control essentially, with a very fancy theme - I fear that will seem more tacked on than usual for games of this ilk. Not a fan of the way in which weapon cards have been purposefully held back to peddle later as 'promos'...

Definitely too heavy for gaming neophytes, but a little too light for serious gamers. An odd blend of difficulty-scales, which... doesn't work at all well.

IT works as a game but I feel the FPS genre is best served by a game that is less euro, less tactical and frankly needs dice for some added chaos.   Love all the guns.  Love how it does not matter if you die, just the damage you do.  Wanted something faster than FRAG, but FRAG is more satisfying that this.  Euro mechanics are not the solution for all modern games.

Why I got rid of it : I think I want my gun games to not play like a euro also thematic gun games deserve dice.  I don't like deterministic combat.

Does an excellent job of capturing old-school Quake Arena/Unreal Tournament games in a boardgame format. The ammo system is well thought out and there is enough movement and chaos to give every player a tough choice on their turn.

Nice little area control game with a twist...the areas are moving! Fun game in the vein of fps's of the 90's carrying multiple ridiculous weapons and running round the map for ammo. With bonus points for first bloods, kill shots and double kills there are plenty of opportunities to score, and as a players deaths increase, his worth decreases so it's advantageous to seek out new victims. Great game.

First person shooter. Score points by applying wounds to other players. There is an extra point for being the first to wound someone, and there is a separate track on which you score points according to the number of times you whack another player (give him/her the final blow). Each player can hold three weapons and three special cards of which there are only four types. Buying and reloading a weapon is done by means of cubes which can be gathered on the battle field.

1 Spiel 5 Spieler: Tolle Spielidee, einfaches Design, Chaos pur.
Ballerspiel im offensiven Unreal tournament Modus; das heißt es zählen nur die Treffer, eigener Schaden spielt kaum eine Rolle. Man rüstet sich mit tollen Waffen aus, die eine Menge Spaß versprechen. 
Dieser Ansatz klang toll und ich hatte die Erwartung, dass mir das Spiel sehr gefallen würde. Leider entsteht keine Schadenfreude, da der Schaden zu unwichtig ist. 
Es gibt einen kleinen Resourcenmanagementteil zum Nachladen der Waffen, wodurch die Komplexität leicht über die Stufe banal gehoben wird, was angenehm ist.
Dadurch dass man die Gegner durch Effekte der Waffen gelegentlich bewegen kann, verändern sich die Möglichkeiten ständig. Ich bin schnell dazu übergegangen, meine Spielzüge nicht mehr zu planen, lohnte sich einfach nicht, dadurch ging weitere Spannung verloren. Dieses Gefühl, dass man aufgeregt ist, weil man einen Plan hat und hofft, dass er umsetzbar bleibt, ging verloren. Das Spiel tendierte Richtung belanglos. 

Das titelgebende Adrenaline kam nicht auf. Schade.

Set up the game as shown on pages 2 and 3.
SPAWNING ON YOUR FIRST TURN
1. Draw 2 powerup cards.
2. Choose 1 to keep.
3. Start your first turn by discarding the other
powerup. Its color determines your spawnpoint.

I. Make 1, 2, or 3 moves.
b. Grab Stuff
I. Make 1 move if you want (up to 2 moves if you
you have at least 3 damage).
II. Grab the thing in your square.
– To grab ammo, pick up the ammo tile.
Move those cubes onto your board.
Discard the tile.
» If the tile gives you a powerup, draw
the card unless you already have 3.
– To grab a weapon, pick up the card. Pay
the reload cost, except the top cube is
free. Keep the card in your hand. The
weapon is loaded.
» If you now have 4 weapons, you
must discard 1 to the space your new
weapon came from. You can discard
a loaded or unloaded weapon.
c. Shoot People
I. Play a weapon card from your hand. (If you
have at least 6 damage, you may make 1 move
first.)
II. Explain how you are using the card's effects.
III. Perform the effects, paying for optional
effects or alternate fire modes, if you use
them.
IV. The weapon is now unloaded. It remains face
up in front of you.
2. Reload
a. You can reload as many of your unloaded
weapons as you want.
b. To reload, pay the reload cost and pick up the
card. It is now loaded.
3. Score each board that received a killshot.

damage.
b. Points are distributed to every player who dealt
damage:
I. The players who dealt the most get the most
points. Second most gets second most, etc.

the killed board's highest remaining point value.
f. Killed player respawns:
I. Draw a powerup card.
II. Discard one of your powerup cards.
III. Respawn in that location.
FINAL FRENZY
1. Final frenzy is triggered when the last skull is taken
from the killshot track.
2. All players with no damage flip over their boards.
They will be worth only a minimal amount.
3. Each player, including the one who triggered final
frenzy, gets one more turn. They flip their action
tiles to the final frenzy side.
a. Those who play before the starting player
choose twice from this set of actions:
I. Move up to 4 squares.

It's propably the best implementation of a shooter in a Boardgame, and that comes from an oldschool Doom-BG-Fan. It's a fun, fast paced area control euro game (allthough the areas are constantly running arround and trying to shoot you ;) . The basic concept is easy enough for casual players to pick up, with enough strategy, variance and depth to interest more experienced players. The game is my personal highlight of the new Essen releases. The only thing I didn't like was the quality of the board, from the way it looks and feels I'm pretty sure it will show first signs of weardown after a few games, but the rest of the components are rof a really great quality

Repetitive, slow, and definitely not a 1 hour game.

A 4 player game took 2 hours to learn and play. Play got bogged down by min/maxing points during each and every turn...When it should be a "I run over here and bash you then run over there" quick game.

During my one and only play, the ammo I needed never seemed to come up within reach. I spent my final few turns not able to do anything but be shot.

If the game were half as long, it would be ok, but its way too repetitive to last as long as it does. 

I was disappointed, and will not be asking to play this again.

As far as thematic Euros go, this one is near perfect. It is actually disguised area majority game where player boards are areas and the game is Unreal Tournament on cardboard. They implemented the feel of massive FPS game quite successfully. It's a fun game when you don't have to wait for your turn very long.
[b]Update:[/b] Not that fun with too many players, so the fun rating dropped from 9 to 8.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Take the rating with a grain of salt as I categorize it as better than 'okay', but it's still a game you need to be in the mood for.

Adrenaline attempts to capture the manic chaos of an arena shooter in the vein of Quake 3 Arena, for example, and translate it to the table.  If you ask me, this is simply an impossible task - twitchy video game genres and tabletop gaming just don't mesh (in contrast, this is why a game like Civ works on the table).  However, the game that results of this attempt is actually quite fun and engaging provided you have the right people at the table.

At its core, Adrenaline is meant to be played fast and furious.  Players attempt to roam around a given map of rooms and shoot each other to bits by picking up weapons and ammo and getting into the right positions.  It's a kill-or-be-killed tactical game, but like the shooters that inspire it, Adrenaline allows players to respawn and keep going, so death isn't the end of the game.  It features a neat-if-fiddly way of rewarding players who do the most damage to someone who has just been killed and also contains a sort of 'revenge' system whereby people who have targeted and killed you get some extra damage from you should you go after them.  While I like the little blood-drop pieces that track damage, in practice they are actually kind of a pain to pick up and manipulate and I don't have big giant gorilla hands, either.

The highlight of the game is taking the idea of an arena shooter and turning it into a tactical experience, and it does this well.  The weapons are typical Quake-inspired arms ranging from simple machine guns and chainsaws to chain-lighting guns, flamethrowers and rocket launchers.  They all require ammo to be spent, which is littered across the map, and expending extra ammo while firing allows you an alt-fire shot that tends to be more powerful or versatile than the normal shot.  All good stuff.  Power-ups are also here in the form of cards and they offer teleportation, gravity pulls, force pushes, etc.  Everything that should be here is here, but anyone thinking of a modern shooter might be disappointed - this is totally based on the late-90s/early-00s style of arena shooter.

The only thing that can really ruin this game is playing it with an AP-prone person.  This game is not meant to be analyzed and meta'd to death like your typical Euro.  It can be done, as evidenced by one of our players, but it is the wrong approach.  Adrenaline is supposed to be fast, chaotic, and ridiculous.  If you play it that way, it's a hell of a lot of fun.  Invite the AP-prone to the table and it robs the game of all of its flavor.  I can't even begin to describe how just one player was able to ruin the experience.  Arguably, AP always ruins the experience, but in heavier, thinkier games, it's tolerated.  It's not welcomed here and anyone who is that intent on winning a game of Adrenaline should look elsewhere.  It's competitive, but please, don't bring your win-at-all-costs attitude to this one.

At its heart, this is a pretty innovative area-control game where the players are the areas. The players move around, picking up weapons and ammo. You place influence by damaging them, and you score an area (player) when the player dies (don't worry, you can respawn, and you don't lose any items).

The mechanics of it are clever, if a bit dull, but it is utterly saved by a fun theme. At one point I had a railgun and was shooting through walls, marvellous. The iconography wasn't the clearest but fortunately it was often possible to intuit the meaning from having a rough idea of the weapon in question so the theme helped at times.

Two things stood out as potentially being problematic. One, once a player has some damage, it tends to attract more damage. Two, it's nearly impossible to plan to get a killshot, a points earner, because so much happens between one of your turns and the next. Both of which are a bit unsatisfying to me.

RATING: 5
Adrenaline is a majority game, where you try and have the majority of your damage tokens on your opponents. Though, there is also majority for kill shots. You get points for first blood on a target. Once a person has been killed, they are scored and then respawn. One of the excellent parts of the game is that taking damage only helps you. When you die, you're worth less points to other players; therefore, making your death to be not that big of a deal, unless you have positioned yourself for a good attack. The variety of weapons in this game is good, but the iconography will cause your first few games and games with new players to really drag. There are a few alternative modes and an expansion has been announced. These should make the game even better and have more variety. While this is alright, I felt it was a little repetitive and there are other games with this player count that I would prefer to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Awesome idea for a game. Love the fact that there are so many guns, and the way you handle ammunition works really well. Iconography gripes seem overblown. Even so it is a somewhat pedestrian for an area-majority game . The incredibly narrow margins make the entire game feel like small ball. Really not very good for 3, either. The theme and feel still keep its rating higher than 6.

What a surprise!  The description of this representing a first-person shooter caused me to actively overlook it.  I don't care for video games, least of all the FPS genre.  However, it really is an area majority game with moving "areas".  It seems better-suited for the higher player counts.  It was introduced to me in a 5p context and there was never a shortage of things to do on your turn.  Indeed, there was tension in choosing between several good options.  With 3p, there was often "lost turns", although this balanced itself both in the scoring and the seeming inevitability that it would happen to everyone occasionally.  

Trying to supply yourself with the right tools and constantly re-supplying was wonderfully frustrating.  I like the scoring, I like the way incentives are reduced the more a character is knocked out, I like the adrenaline mechanism.  It just really makes sense, it looks good (I'm quite happy with the color choices, though note I've heard complaints about it from others) and its simplicity belies an interesting challenge that is different every game since it is so player-dependent.  

I am rating this a "9", but it could definitely go up with more play.

I am a bit disappointed in this one actually. 
I was expecting a fast flowing non stop action, shoot'em'up style game, however there is actually quite a lot of downtime between turns and gameplay is a bit fiddly which slows everything down, which is a real shame as they have tried something very different with this one and I feel they didn't quite pull it off, that immersion in the theme is not quite there.

RATING: 5
2017-01-09: Good idea and quite thematic, but the penalty for getting killed is to low (ie nothing) so defensive play gives almost no meaning. Just stand in the line of fire, it doesn't really matter.
This makes for a more chaotic experience than I like where it is more random than I'd like who gets the big points. To mitigate others getting points you have to check each players weapons and try to adjust your placement according to that but who the heck finds that fun every round?

So I am a bit disappointed in the game, I was hoping for something better from the hype (which I was fully eating up).
Initial rating: 5(might go up to 6 if I play again and see there is more to the game than I thought)

Rettegtem tőle, mert a ezek a namostveledkibaszok játékok nagyon nem nekem valók.
Ehhez képest kellemesen csalódtam. Egyértelműen szempont volt a tervezésnél, hogy ne legyen kifejezetten hátrányos az, hogy ha téged lőnek, illetve ne érje meg folyamatosan ugyanazt lőni. És az erre kitalált mechanikák nagyszerűen működnek is. Így viszont nagyon jó önfeledt lövöldözést sikerült összerakni, aminek a savát-borsát a fegyverek adják. Itt van az egyetlen hiba is, sajnos az ikonográfia elég rettenetes lett. Szerintem jobb lett volna nyelvfüggővé tenni a játékot, de ha az ikonok mellett is döntenek, akkor meg jó lett volna valaki hozzáértőt szerződtetni erre a feladatra. Így rengeteget kellett bújni elsőre a szabályt. Szerencsére nincs annyira sok, szóval, megtanulhatóak idővel.

Great concept and theme but the downtime really kills it. Also the extra icons on the weapons are confusing (some don't mean anything). It's conflicting because you can play with less people to have less downtime but the game is better when there are more people..

If this game actually played in ~45 min, had less down time between player turns, and didn't need to explain so many of the weapons/icons to new players, it'd be a fun light game

The games theme tries to encapsulate what I considered to be like an unreal tournament style FPS (first person shooter, for those who aren't savvy) but in a board game. And it nailed it. I got absolutely stomped when we played this and I still had a blast. The only thing I wish it had was unique character abilities. This game is all positioning and strategy. Absolutely love it.

Internalizing all the card effects is... let's be honest, not even a little bit fun. Also, the physical process of ammo management is :(

Once you've gotten beyond those, turn-by-turn puzzles about how to take the lead on a given damage track are totally fun. And it's fine with me that it's not "really" a first-person shooter; it's really an area control game where the areas are running away from you on the board, which...

Huh, that gives me an idea for a game.

Anyway, this is the best non-Vlaada CGE game I've played, and if you like good-natured complaining during certain games, this will probably be a hit because you feel sort of put-upon, getting shot all the time, but actually everybody gets shot and being shot isn't bad for you. It's pretty clever.

RATING: 8
SO many weapons, love the replayability: Everyone has had totally different weapon setups each game. With 4 the game is hectic and chaotic, while still managing to be fast and tactical. The way scoring works feels very well tuned and as long as you're in the mix (not running and hiding) it's hard to fall too far behind. So the game ends up being about small optimisations but avoids the feeling of irrelevant choices but an appropriate margin. This game does an excellent job of disguising how euro-ish it really is and makes it easy to get to the table. 

Pace pace pace. Pace is so essential to this game, in order to hit the feel of a fast-paced shooter people have to be trying to play faster I've found. If you're moving too slow it loses a bit of the theme and the benefit of it's *potentially* fast playtime. AP prone players beware.

Haven't played with final frenzy yet, really want to. Chance for this game to move up in rating.

Tu aimes les FPS, genre Quake et Unreal Tournament ? Ben c'est exactement ça. Tu vas d'une salle à l'autre, tu ramasse des armes, tu lattes tes adversaires, tu meurs, tu ramasse des armes. Repeat.

Il ne faut PAS jouer avec des mecs affectés par la paralysie analytique, car sinon c'est infernal (de toutes façons, c'est systématiquement casse-couille, ça, non ?).

Ray. Regalo de la cuchipandi 2017

Es un combate todos contra todos, que representa (y consigue representar bastante) un "Arena FPS" estilo Quake III, Unreal Tournament y similares. Es decir: correr por un escenario pequeño, coger armas y pegar tiros a los demas. 

Mecanicas bastante logradas que consiguen en pocos turnos que te centres en machacar enemigos y no en "y esto como decias que se hacia??". 

El juego esta en ingles pero la dependencia del idioma es escasa. un manual sencillito en el que la mayor parte del espacio consiste en describir qué hacen las armas. y en las cartas de las armas no hay texto porque esta todo presentado con esquemas. Con los esquemas al principio te haces un poco la picha un lio, pero en realidad son bastante claros. 

Partidas rapidas (rondando la hora y media, con preparacion) y muy intensas. Materiales razonablemente buenos. Bastante bien ilustrado aunque tal vez le falte un poco de porte a algunos personajes. por el precio esta muy bien. 

Se lleva un 8 muy largo, y merecido.

A somewhat pedestrian area-majority game with some fluidity and an admittedly novel theme. Kind of cute, but the incredibly narrow margins make the entire game feel like small ball. Really not very good for 3, either.
And dear lord, the iconography on the weapons is quite bad. Seems like it could lead to a preference towards the simpler ones.

Excellent - very much enjoy playing.

Brilliant! Fast paced and extremely thematic with the most amazing components. It won't appeal much to those who love heavy euro games as its light without so much strategy as other heavier euro games but it's excellent for those who love theme, European style games and fast paced action. Easy to teach, fast to set up, unbelievably fun to play. The fact that it includes 3 game modes with 4 different maps adds tremendously to an already great value. Will never turn a game down and will always like to go at least a couple rounds every time I play.

RATING: 6.5
Simple, direct and too the point. A fun romp that simulates a Third-person shooter into a board game. I think my favorite aspect of the game is it's simplicity and diceless-combat mechanics which is always a breath of fresh air. 

However the game feels a bit lacking in certain areas. They game could've used a bit more weapons and items and maybe a better map configuration for 3 players. 3 Players uses a "bot" character that switches ownership amongst players every round. I got rid of it, hoping more comes out for it, cause as is feels stripped.

If an expansion does release the only thing I ask from it is:

-More weapons(obvious)
-6th player
-Better 3 player rules/scenarios or maps
-unique player powers

RATING: 8
As many have said before, it is quite intriguing how tactical and close to a "pure" euro this game is for being under the guise of a FPS. Little randomness to speak of, just a zillion constantly changing variables to consider. Provides a visceral rush once combatants learn to go with their guts and play quickly.

Be wary it will drag if people cannot roll with the pace, and while I understand *why* it is the way it is from a mechanical standpoint, it is a bit annoying that there is not a more substantial penalty for dying. Especially when you really want to hand it to that someone that walked into an obvious combo and all but gifted someone else a ton of points.

It's a very tactical game with a little diplomacy and minimal randomness, but no strategy. It's a good beer and pretzels game with a little bit of take-that, and plenty of opportunities to trash talk. An amusing hybrid euro/trash game.

Adrenaline is a great idea for a game, looks like a clever design on paper, and has solid components, but it ends up being a slog to play through a full game. For all the interesting potential it provides, so much of the game comes down to being in the right place at the right time as opposed to responding tactically to game's state. With so little control, it becomes uninteresting to plan or execute actions. Hopefully another design will come along to tackle this same theme with less chaotic gameplay.

First Person Shooter in a box. 
Not a huge fan of the art and minis I would of preferred a WW2 type setting or even a sci-fi setting so that is why I was hesitant to play but did want to try it eventually, tried it and game play is great, lots of fun, fast and thematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Run around, pick stuff up (ammo and power-ups), shoot people. The actions in this arena battle game are very basic. What generates interest is the way shooting is scored. Every point of damage dealt is tracked by who dealt it. At the end of a turn when players are killed, they are immediately scored in an area majority competition, with the player applying the most hits getting the most points. The killed players then respawn immediately and start firing again on their next turn. After 8 kills there is one more round of super-powered actions and the game ends. Partial wounds are scored and kill shots are compared in a final majority competition.

This is not really in my personal-wheelhouse of preferred game play, but it is so simple compared to other dicey combat games with tons of modifiers I might just hold onto it. While the game is entirely tactical, I would venture to say the tactics here are very shallow. There really are no defensive moves to make and all of your decisions revolve around picking the right targets to get kill shots and majorities and maintaining your ammo and gun supply. However, even those decisions are driven by what's available and what you can reach, which can change greatly between your turns. This is not a game-night main event game, but a game for teenagers, casual gamers, or a bit of fluff between heavier games on a game day. If I do drop this game, it is likely to be because of the box size, which is substantial.

RATING: 5
This just isn't my type of game. Mostly because it is high on tactical decisions and very short on strategic ones. There is a board and minis, but it lacks the fun puzzly nature you find in good tactical mini games. 

I do love the variety of weapons available and finding interesting combos between them. That was enough to sustain my interest for a couple of plays.

I can see why people would enjoy this game it does an admirable job of addressing potential pitfalls in this style of game. However, the titular experience of gaining adrenaline is not something that the player can control. It happens randomly as people attack you, and you may or may not even get a turn where you are able to benefit from adrenaline.

On the face of it adrenaline seems to be compensation for having been shot so much, but the game already address this problem. So instead some players randomly gain an advantage by having adrenaline turns, while others do not. I wish this was handled a different way. For example by handing out adrenaline tokens that can be spent for better actions, this way it's more homogeneous.

RATING: 5
Adrenaline is an unusual area majority game with areas being moving targets. The shooter theme works but unluckily, the game beneath the original theme is average.

Gameplay is exclusively tactical which isn't bad in itself. The problem is a lack of distinction. The common turn has a player grabbing some ammo, shoot and reload. Sometimes, grabbing and reloading is replaced by getting a new weapon. Pulling off a clever move doesn't help much. In the end, the scores will be close. Getting a fitting power-up card or matching ammo cube replacements in front of you can be as decisive as own decisions.

Worth a play for curiosity but no hidden depths to discover. Thematic gamers will be put off by the abstract scoring.

2017-05-06 - 5 - I played only with three players and I know it's probably better with more. The game didn't impress me, although didn't disappoint because I already knew that it doesn't keep a promise of FPS excitement as it is a dressed up euro game. I had so much more fun during skirmish Imperial Assault and I doubt that more players will make Adrenaline better for me. The scoring system of "who did more wounds" is VERY mechanical and dry, but if only frags would get you points, the game probably wouldn't work at all.
AND if you will play with some "I count every little point in every little move" dude, this game becomes totally opposite of what it tries to be.

+ I like the mechanics of the game
+ There is high player involvement
+ The game seems to have decent replayability because of the variable weapon set-up
+ The game is easy to teach

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Adrenaline:[/b][/size]
/ The game lacks a co-operative mode. An upcoming expansion might address this issue and cause the game to be rated higher.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Adrenaline:[/b][/size]
- The game seemed to lack meaningful decisions. 
- The game was missing variable board set-ups.
- The scoring system was a bit odd in terms of how you had to spread the damage across multiple players. I found this somewhat non-thematic.

This game is fantastic in its ability to provide a cinematic experience. The weapon combos make this game a blast and managing your resources to be at hand at the right time is essential to good play. We've only played the introductory game so far, but it felt a beit slow moving and yet ended too early for my tastes. Granted, it was a shorter version of the game and it's obvious from the time spent passing around the rule book that this game rewards familiarity that comes from repeat plays. Overall, I'm very pleased with Adrenaline and I'm excited to get it back to the table.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a quick playing and interesting take on FPS as a boardgame. This is largely an area majority game with moving targets and each person being that area. I do wish there was a bit more in the way of defense so you could have a bit more control over who possibly damages you if you perceive an opponent that is closer to you in score. There's no turtling here as the game practically forces you to fight. The various types of weapons all have very different and interesting affects. Looking forward to exploring this one more. Tempted to put in a timer to keep this game moving even faster.

Adrenaline is a well designed and produced tactical combat game that’s easy to learn and fun to play. It puts you in the thick of the action and keeps you there the entire game. The large variety of weapons in the game provide unique ways to set up attacks against opponents, promoting repeated plays to discover all the different strategies available with the weapons. The confined play space does not allow for many areas to run and hide, so players who prefer more defensive options may not enjoy this in-your-face nature of combat.

Adrenaline really captures the feel of playing first person shooter video games I’ve enjoyed like Unreal Tournament where the sole focus is to quickly hunt down your opponents while avoiding them doing the same to you, respawning when you’re eventually slain and jumping right back into the action again. There is a Euro game aspect to managing your resources well and planning your attacks efficiently with the weapons available that accompanies this quick action game of attacks and evasions. Still, the beating heart of this game and the reason it’s called Adrenaline can be seen in the frenetic pace of players moving around the board and chasing their opponents with guns reminiscent of the BFGs of yesteryear’s video games.

All the parts of this sleek sci-fi combat game work like a well oiled machine to get the blood pumping in this figurative exercise of attacks and survival.

Is this game fun? Yes.
Is it fast? No. 

That's essentially the issue. It's a wild and wooly game that doesn't play as fast as it should in order to be something I'd ask for on a regular basis. It also commits the cardinal sin of having only one player handout when you really need to have one per player because you're forever trying to look up what a specific weapon does.

Interesting ideas abound however.

Feels like a shooter with the killing of opponents and running around a map.  However, it's all wrapped up as a low luck euro.  Very tactical since you have to manage your ammo and try to stay ahead on the damage tracks of your opponents.

A really fun shooting game with small learning curve. Once you get past understanding the symbols on cards it's all about hammering each other and deciding who's death is more useful to you. Often it means that one of the players is picked out and everybody's after his death strike. But what I really like about the game is that once somebody's dead, others get less points when killing him afterwards (yes, you are like a cat with several lives). This really keeps the game balanced.

With this game everyone at the table really is in the same vision the creator wanted! It feels like an old game of James bond Golden eye or halo (original xbox version). One of my top 3 games.

FUN: this really feels like a first-person shooter as a boardgame, but without the luck of predecessors that ttried the same.

UNIQUE: this is basically an area-control and resource management game in disguise, but the theming creates an unique FPS experience without rolling any dice.

NEGATIVES: no asymetrical player powers.

Good game - fun and quick.  A reasonable amount of rules overhead to being with, but once learned the game moves along at a reasonable pace, with the exception of needing to look up the details about what each gun does - it isn't easily identifiable from the iconography, which acts more as an aide once the effects are already known.  Would happily play it with my buddies, but don't want to own it.

I get the "fps" branding but it a) doesn't fly for me in practice (feels more like a stripped-down Front Mission than Unreal Tournament) and b) the whole thing just seems pretty pointless.  If I want to play an fps I'll just do that rather than play Adrenaline.

The reloading mechanic keeps you moving around the arena, but the map is so small it seems like you can get to anyone at any time pretty much.  After getting a decent weapon or two the game stagnates until someone wins.  We didn't drop weapons when someone dies, which seems athematic if the goal is to reproduce an arena shooter.

Really good decision to make the game end after a total number of kills rather than go until someone gets x points.

Great action game with non-stop combat. Different weapons fun to envision and nice they made a nifty modular board to keep it fresh. However, the game is marred by one of the worst scoring systems I have seen in a long time. To score the remaining hits at end game at the same level as kills in the regular match is ludicrous, and ends up screwing the scores entirely. This has deducted at least a point off my score. Really terrible rules decision.

I feel like Adrenaline could be a better game, but I'm not sure how. THe game play is cool and the theme is awesome, but when it comes down to it, it's just an are control game; which isn't to say it's bad. Maybe what I was missing was the mobility that a "FPS" allows. It is also very tight (in terms of size) so things like taking cover and short range are essentailly lost. Sure there are walls and yes there are hand guns but it could be more...I think. That being said, I really enjoyed the game and would totally play again.

191116: Two plays in, I like Adrenaline a LOT. The mechanics are pretty fluid, there's little upkeep and the game is easy to teach to new people. However, the target audience for the game is people who have played Unreal Tournament or Quake or somesuch and can get into the mood. If not, the joy of overkilling people and blasting with railsguns is lessened. I've played the game with 3 and 4 people, both work wonderfully. 

The best thing about this game for me thus far are: it's wonderfully thematic, colourful, and it discourages ganging up on people with it's mechanics.

RATING: 8
I'm conflicted on this one. I love the euro style (almost zero luck except deck draw) play combined with the run-and-gun theme. It's really an area control base-popper (like Smash-Up) disguised as a shooting game (where the enemy is the area you're trying to control by wounding them most). It's great fun to pull off a vicious combo. However, the problem comes from other players. This game should be fast paced and take about an hour, maybe 90 minutes to play. Yet both my plays, thus far, have taken far too long. Players easily get bogged down making decisions and even when encouraged to think ahead of their turn can either get distracted and forget of become unstuck by a previous move. I am probably a little biased as I can do these calculations quickly, but it's hard to encourage others to play this with the pace it really requires to be most fun.

I love this game and don't want rid of it at all. But worry without the right player mind-set this may end up like Arcadia Quest, a game I love that I don't ever get the right opportunity to play.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly fun & nice table presence. The whole point are the weapons, which are basically a card drafting system, while the damage/point system makes it bit of an area control game. So you just try to squeeze damage here and there and everywhere. Chaotic to the max, there is very little to do, basically you just get the best weapon/and or stuff you can and/or shoot someone, rinse and repeat. But oddly fun!

-Downtime
-The need to explain individual cards (weapons) in addition to the rules

Long downtimes (due to way too many choices) and almost every weapon needs an explanation. However, this was one of the most satisfying games to pull off combos. Ever shotgunned someone in range of your vortex gun which then proceeds to suck 3 players in it? I thought not...

Also, for some reason it feels so satisfying to immediately be able to reload a weapon after you used it.

RATING: 6
Such a cool idea for a game. This really does feel like someone took Halo or Unreal Tournament, and made it into a board game. The way you run around, shoot people, and balance your ammo all feels very thematic. Unfortunately, it also takes awhile to get off the ground. The first couple turns feel very slow before things start to ramp up. As the game goes along, it also starts to feel really repetitive. Move here, shoot this person, be opportunistic. It's all...fine...but it doesn't really replace the feel of sitting down with some buddies to play Call of Duty. Some ideas just don't implement well into board games, and this is one such idea. Love the overall presentation though. If they could make the game go by just a little faster, this could easily be an 8 or 9 for me.

Reminds me of those gun games on Nintendo 64.  Something that I like (and somewhat dislike) is that each character available to play as is not unique (except in their appearance) each character has the SAME exact "stats."  However, EVERY gun (literally EVERY gun) is unique to itself (you won't find the same two guns...ever).  Very easy to grasp and blast!  Tons of fun and CAN play with only 2 players (better with more like every other game out there lol).  The first couple of games take about 90 minutes (each gun has it's own rules and they aren't listed on the weapon cards clearly)  but after that an hour sounds about right per game.  Oh and no dice rolls just basic "this-gun-can-hit-you-and-I-have-the-ammo-to-do-it...eat "x" damage."  Lots of fun!

RATING: 7
Fun game where you run around and shoot your friends (don't worry they come back).  The way you power up as you take damage and lose value for being killed helps force players to spread out their attacks and get away from picking on the weakest player.  This would score higher if I had a regular group to play this, but playing normally only with two keeps this a respectable 7 for now.

I really like this game, it is fast (after 2nd play), very interactive with the "take that" mechanic, also you can create combos with weapons and power up cards.

Players can develop strategies to take one enemy down, and rounds later they will come after you. 

It shines by its simplicity.

Adrenaline might not rank as the best action game with miniatures, but it is fun and different enough to stand on its own. At the beginning figuring out the iconography takes time but once it clicks the game runs smoothly. The theme comes very abstract. Essentially you are just trying to get the more hits sooner than everyone else. When a figure is knocked out, everyone who shot them scores. Whoever hit them more times gets the most points and viceversa. It is fun to pretend we are frantically shooting each other out while we really just push plastic cubes around. Overall, a great combo of area control and card play. An expansion that will add team play is supposed to come out this year. Can’t wait!

A reasonable Player vs Player game. There's some fun in there and the randomness is limited to the resource generation and the occasional power up cards.

Seep. Mecánicamente funciona, pero hubo un par de cosas que no me terminaron de cerrar.

En principio el paso del juego. Me pareció lento, demasiado pausado para un juego que se llama "Adrenalina". La tensión simplemente no está ahí, hay demasiado cálculo de por medio, porque toda la información es abierta y no tiene azar, así que el cálculo realmente paga.

Por otro lado, tiene un nivel de caos que te hace difícil de planificar. Los jugadores pueden hacer cualquier cosa. Tienen pilas de armas a su disposición y como el mapa es tan chico, cualquiera alcanza a cualquiera en cualquier lado, en infinidad de formas posibles.

Ok, tal vez no "infinidad", pero si suficientes para cada turno de cada jugador que llega un momento que no te vas a quedar "recalculando" como un GPS en un juego de autitos chocadores. Simplemente esperás que te llegue el turno con cierta vana esperanza de hacer lo que querés y ves qué hacer cuando tu esperanza se esfuma.

Respecto de la mecánica, ser sencilla no hace automáticamente un juego interesante, y creo que tener muchas opciones a este diseño le resta. Le resta importancia a la decisión, porque las consecuencias son demasiado inmediatas y demasiado impredecibles más allá.

Respecto a la dinámica, "recalculando" no es adrenalina. Las armas son lo único que tiene flavor. Los personajes son cosméticos, el mapa es cosmético, al punto que se podría eliminar el tablero y las minis sobreproducidas convertirlo en un simple juego de take-that.

Meh, paso.

Played a demo at a convention, it is really good. Captures the feel and tension of a FPS arena game but is a resource management game!

After a couple more plays, it is an OK game and I would happily play it again. It isn't something I'd want to own and I find lacks something I cannot quite put my finger on. Maybe slightly too long, and can induce AP in players. Where I see that the game should play quickly.

I've always liked those online flash games where you run around the board grabbing weapons to shoot at everybody else. If you get hit, bummer, but no big deal; you'll just spawn back in somewhere else. But you want to at least make the other guys die, too, so you have the biggest score in the end.  Adrenaline captures that same feeling but in board game form. It uses euro mechanisms to deliver an Amerithrash feeling. As an added bonus, the game doesn't take itself too seriously as is most easily demonstrated in the light-hearted and comical rule book in the style that CGE is known for. Adrenaline is super fun.

(01/18) An absolute blast of a game, it is quite interactive, turns can go fast and it brings up zany joy to people playing it. I didn't think a board game would feel like a FPS, but this one does. 

It is basically an euro resource management game hidden in a bullet ridden and agressive package. The guns are really fun to use and finding out combos is great.

The first play might be difficult for newcomers to get a grasp on the many guns and their effects, but as soon as it gets going the iconography on them becomes really easy to understand.

My only complaint is that I feel the board could be bit bigger. The board is little so it is crowded and incentivize conflict, but I feel there could be at least three more spaces to have more of a choice sometimes and motivate chases.

Designer has done well to port an FPS feeling to board games. Not as fast as I expected but good fun. This is no luck fest but a game of optimization as everyone is rewarded for damage dealt to opponents. An area control game whereby your areas are moving around and shooting back at you. A very Euro feeling to what I thought was only possible in Ameritrash fashion.

In this game, players move around a board shooting each other. When you damage another player, you mark this with tokens of your color, and when the player dies, you do a little scoring based on how often that player has died, who made the kill shot, and who had the most damage. While conceptually I like the idea of these walking majority areas, the game feels like it's missing something. Players move so much during a turn that where you position yourself doesn't appear to matter very much. The weapons have somewhat difficult iconography for a quick(?) game like this, and are perhaps too varied? Overall it just felt too chaotic for my taste.

RATING: 7
An interesting game with an odd disconnect between its gameplay and theme. The core gameplay is interesting and pretty light, with some meaningful decisions to make. Other players can and will mess with your plans and the board state between your turns, so playing well comes down more to tactics and luck than strategy. This would all work fairly well (though not great), but the gameplay encourages thoughtful pauses to figure out your optimum move, but the theme is all about fast-paced shooting. It seems very out of place to carefully consider whether to charge in a room and smack someone with a glowing hammer or run past and grab some ammo and then shoot someone else with a rocket launcher. The theme and gameplay actually detract from each other, and neither is compelling enough on its own to make this game stand out.

RATING: 7
Quite decent SciFi/Space Game. It is essentially a resource management  'take that' game that probably requires much less thought to play than most gamers will attempt to put into it. The bits are very nice although the weapon iconography isn't instantly clear and there may be more diversity in the weapons than is really necessary.

First person shooter concept made in to a board game. Works well as you try and use different weapons to wound and kill your opponents.

I did not think this game would appeal to me at all, despite being told that it isn't as confrontational or chaotic as it looks. The player interaction is constant without being obnoxious. Really, this is more of an area majority game where the areas you want to control (your opponent's life meter) keep hopping around the board. It's especially satisfying when you've picked the perfect weapon for the job.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this game.  It felt like a classic FPS game and played very smoothly.  It plays better at a higher player count.  We have played 2 players with a bot, which is the [i]worst[/i] "player count" and I still love it.

The entire time I am playing this I am reminded of my years at university playing Quake III Arena, CS and Unreal Tournament.  Maybe there is a huge nostalgia component here for me, but I really enjoy playing this game because of all these great memories - and creating new ones.

Somehow this game caused AP in me and this totally wrecks this game. It should be played more quickly to stay true to its theme. It has very Euro mechanisms (which lead to the AP), but a fun theme (which did not emerge for me due to the AP).

It is a good game, but not for me.

Played a 5 player game and there is so much going on in this game that you are always looking at the rule book to see what every card does. Over time you will learn all of the icons and this will get better but by then you will just know every card in the game and there is not that many. Did not really like the game and really do not want to play again.

In the one play that I've done so far, it ended up getting to thinky for some. Not sure why. The board is small enough that there's really nowhere to "hide". With all 5 players on the board, someone is always going to be able to shoot you, and there's not really a need for positioning for the next turn since pretty much everything will change by then. Only pre-planning is weapon choice and ammo. I think the game play is great and would be a lot of fun. Needs to be taken less seriously and not for the AP prone. Keep the game play fast and its probably best with 4. Really annoying that the game only comes with 21 weapon cards. A 5 player game can have them holding 15 weapons cards, so only 6 cards are left for the remaining 9 weapon holds (a location could be left empty). Seems like the minimum should have been 24.

Adrenaline is a rich, satisfying experience that you can crank up or down to the complexity level of your choice.

Based on the theme, I was expecting this to be a nonstop slaughterfest (like Kemet). Instead, I got a eurogame that involves a lot of shuffling cubes around. As a eurogame, it's still pretty good, though. There's virtually no downside to being shot; in fact, it's often an advantage.

Played a three player game. The scoring is boring in three player since majority scoring just doesn't work with three, but the gameplay itself is fun. You've always got options and every weapon does what it feels like it should. Also the iconography is some of the best I've ever seen. I was able to figure out every weapon without looking them up (though we looked them up just to be sure).

RATING: 6
Cute majority game with a first-person-shooter theme. Each player can take a certain amount of damage before they die; points are awarded for getting in first, doing the most and taking the final killshot, at which point they respawn, now worth slightly fewer VP to make others into more tempting targets.

Shooting itself is accomplished by picking up various unique weapons and the ammo to power them, then spending precious actions moving into line of sight. Ammo is scarce so deciding when to shoot is as large an element of the puzzle as working out who to fire at. Different weapons have different synergies (e.g., use the vortex gun to pull enemies into the same space and then an explosive weapon to hit all of them at once) so it does allow for entertaining combo-building.

It's a solid tactical puzzle that feels remarkably fresh given how little of it is genuinely original. Downsides are the randomness, the potential for analysis paralysis, and the slow first game(s) until all players fully understand the good but diverse gun iconography.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game works as a FPS-themed Euro, and that is surprising and cool.  I also think it is very cool that getting shot is not a big deal, so targeting a player isn't an exercise in politics or sadism.  I like the different guns, and the rules work pretty well.  The iconography mostly worked for me.  

But overall I can't really recommend the game.  It just felt like it was missing something to make the game actually special and worth playing more than once.  Part of the fun of something like Quake or Unreal is the surprise and excitement of finding someone and engaging them in a gunfight.  None of that tension makes it into the game.  It's a mostly straightforward exercise in area control, and while it is clever in theme, it is not so much clever in gameplay.  I rarely felt like i had any truly interesting decisions to make.

Creatively fun shooter game, which is largely about creating good combos and managing limited ammo. Scoring system is excellent and a big part of the game; trying to get majorities on various players. Constantly blasting each other, but getting hurt doesn't really hurt you; you won't want revenge on someone for shooting you, you'll want revenge on someone for shooting someone ELSE and stealing your majority.

Great variety of weapons, but the icon system is terrible. A good reference sheet is an absolute must.

OK, now games with killing and stuff are not my thing. [thing=15363]Except when they are[/thing]. And this one works for me. Pick up some weapons or power. Shoot some opponents. Reload your weapon. Simple and fast. This is what the death match mode in the [thing=10640][/thing] expansion should have been.
So while this is not really my genre, I had a good time playing this and would happily play again. Good design.

Adrenaline does a great job of recreating the feeling of a first person shooter.  You run around and pick up weapons like grenade launchers, chainsaws, and sniper rifles and shoot as many people as you can.  Meanwhile, it uses a very smooth and interesting ammunition system that gives the game some mechanical weight.  Perhaps my favorite part of Adrenaline when compared to other FPS attempts (like [thing=2025][/thing], for example), is that you don't have to roll any dice to attack.  It all comes together in a very nice package.

Another aspect I like is that there isn't really any downside to getting shot.  You actually get stronger as you take damage, simulating your adrenaline flowing.  So, you don't get rewarded for camping/turtle-ing like is so often common in FPSs.

However, the fact that you don't get penalized for getting shot means that spacial positioning is less important and there is pretty much always someone to shoot.  And it doesn't matter a whole lot who you shoot, so the decisions felt somewhat shallow.  You mostly just shoot whoever you can whenever you can, then use your other actions to pick up more ammo.  So, while I was immersed in the game and had a good time, I wonder if there is enough strategic depth for repeated plays.

I would never imagine that you can combine FPS videogame feel with the boardgame that sets itself in "euro" category with basically no luck, dice rolls or card play. And yet it's one of the best "videogame genre" games I ever played.

While Doom is a pure fun where luck and fun plays it's big part, Adrenaline represents the classical multipalyer shooters based on skills and knowledge of weapons, map layout and everything. I highly enjoyed the game and so do my co-workers (videogame developers). ;-)

Super fun game. Love the run and gun aspect, minus the penalty for dying. The mechanics are great, but I would say it drags a little with 5 players. Idk if it was just alot of talking in between, but after the first round of deaths, the game lagged hard. The problem might have been that there was too much though in between turns, when it needs to just be about shooting, and grabbing the ammo needed to reload. Love it regardless, can't wait to try the other game modes.

A boardgame trying to mimic a first person shooter sounds awful gimmicky. I shouldn't have bet against the minds at CGE, as they've actually pulled it off.

The game looks great and captures the feel of a frantic fragfest. There's enough game here as well, with resource management and spacial planning required to succeed.

Adrenaline plays like no other boardgame I've encountered and I think it'll go over well with my gaming friends who haven't yet made the plunge into cardboard.

First Impression:

An adaptation of the shoot-em-up style of pc games to a boardgame. Ah, WHY>?

Let's say that you love action packed shoot-em-up pc games (I personally do not). Chances are you like the non-stop action, skill based gameplay (aiming etc) and community aspect of it (dozens of players). Why on earth would you want to play a boardgame that pretty much kills all these aspects almost completely? Run around, grab a gun, grab some ammo, shoot, repeat. Again and again and again until either your mind dies or the game ends.

Does this game try hard to solve the incredible amount of issues that are created when you try to adapt something that wasn't designed to be a boardgame? Yes to its credit. It solves the player ganging and king making (mostly) that boardgamers have learned to hate. It solves the weapon imbalance by resource management. It solves player elimination by instant respawning. It solves kill assists by giving score to all that caused some damage. I could go on but the thing is that all these problems are created by the CONCEPT of the game.

And of course in the end the gameplay is boring, repetitive and scripted. Where is the skill of pc games? Where are the decisions of boardgames? Worst of both worlds.

So once again, WHY does this game exist? Couldn't all this beautiful creativity be turned into something meaningful?

Described to me as a video-game-like 'shooter', it's a fairly accurate description of the game.

I thought it was acceptable for what it was, but I doubt I'd play it again.

RATING: 7
This game is good and I would play it more.  The game does a great job capturing first person shooter death matches. However, the game feels unfinished.  They could fix this with an expansion easily.  As I understand the first expansion is to be announced at Essen 2017 so maybe they will address the issues I have, but I'm not excited about having to get an expansion to complete the base set.  

The card sizes are weird,  You need Fantasy Flight Red (Mini Euro) for power ups and Mayday Yellow (Space Alert) to sleeve the game.  One pack of each will do.

Below is how I would tackle the issues I have and a few suggestions for future cards. 

I believe the game should have more modes of play.  Such as capture the flag and an oddball/juggernaut variant.  Capture the flag is suppose to be addressed in the expansion along with team play with up to 6 players.  I hope they make the game playable for 2 as well.  Getting 3+ is not always the easiest.  A smaller game board would work to make the game 2 player.

For a oddball/juggernaut variant I would like to see something like:

Skullcrusher Mode (7 rounds, since you need a skull token)
The first player to deliver a killshot to another player gains a skull token to their ammo box. The player with the skull deals 1 extra damage each time they deal damage from a weapon (power ups wouldn't count). At the end of a player's turn the player with the skull token heals 1 damage (furthest right on their player board). The skull token passes to the other player who deals a kill shot against the player holding the skull. When a player with the skull delivers a killshot they get +2VP.

Having the ammo tiles spawn face down could be another interesting mode of play.  If the the tile was face down there would be more design space.  The creators could include proximity mines.  A staple of older fps games.  Playing out something like this when a player moved into a space with a face down tile the ammo tile would be revealed until grabbed.  If the player reveals a proximity mine then each player in the space would take 2 damage immediately and the mine would be discarded.  There would be very few mines to make them not appear often.

For some odd reason med packs were not included in the game.  These could be another ammo tile. When grabbed they would heal the player 1 damage or allow the player to add 1 ammo of any color to their ammo box.

Depending on the number of players you will not see all the weapons the game has to offer.  Sometimes you don't like the available weapons either.  Players should be able to spend a grab stuff action on the spawning point to place a current weapon that can be grabbed on the bottom of the weapon deck and draw a new weapon in its place. 

Grenades were also excluded from the base game.  They could be represented as power up cards.  Grenades could play out like this:

Concussion Grenade
Spend a red ammo cube.
Deal 1 damage to target player in your line of sight. On that player's next turn they can only use 1 action.

Sticky Grenade
Spend 2 red ammo cubes.
Place 3 marks on target player in your line of sight. At the beginning of that player’s turn all marks on that player become damage. 

Additional Power Up cards could be:

Tactical Knife
Spend a yellow ammo cube.
Deal 2 damage to a player on the same space as you. 

Thrusters
You may move one additional space. 

Of course players want to see more weapons in future expansions.  A couple neat abilities I thought about are:

Portal Blaster
Use: Move up to 1 space through walls or you may shoot through walls this turn.
Additional ability: Pay the full ammo cost of a loaded gun you have and use it.

Impact Crossbow
Bolt of Lightning: Deal 1 damage to target enemy you can see. 
Critical Shot: At the end of your turn if Impact Crossbow is in your reload area and you do not reload it deal 1 damage to a target already damaged by Impact Crossbow.

I don't have the exact wording and cost figured out.

I tested this game out for rhe first time with a mix of experienced and non-gamers. Some with memories of FPS video games. Theme was excellent for me who loves old FPS classics with laughs and puns. We had 5 players and it was full of action. Icons shows the rules in simple ways that made me understand them when playing (ie learn as youbolay works great). Game was just long enough to create a good game. Recommended for theme and good game play as well. No one seemed to get behind too much.

Roligt spel som inte har så mycket taktik som vissa tror. Undvik att spela med folk som tenderar till att sjunka in i AP. En favorit hos min lillebror. Unikt tema till ett eurogsme.

Does what it wants to do pretty well, but I'm just not that interested in what it does. It's also a pain to read all the weapon cards across the board, and the iconography on them isn't always clear.

Initial thoughts prior to release: "I used to love first-person shooter games, so if they can capture that style of game in a boardgame, I can imagine that being a big hit."

After a couple plays in 2017: It's not a first-person shooter in a boardgame. It's an area control, resource management game, where every so often you pick up a cool weapon and get to do some damage that garners some laughs. 

Dare I say it that I wish there was some dice chucking to add some risk/reward. It's boring knowing what's about to happen when someone activates their weapon. More unknowns would be great.

Was not sad to see my friend sell this one off.

The game wants to make you feel like you were in some kinda cyber shooting game but you just don't.
At the beginning you choose a weapon and load it and then you start shooting other players. There is absolutely no need to plan your turn ahead cause you are likely to be moved around the board on the opponents turns. When you hit someone you give him your "drops", that feels like you buy some "shares" from this guy and if he dies you get points according to how many of them you had.
The downtime is too long for such kinda game. Overall I was very disappointed of this, was expecting much more. I think I won't play this again, didn't enjoy it at all.
Despite all the above, you gotta give credit to the designers because IF you like the gameplay, you will have a huge game here since there is a lot of variety and replayability thanks to the very very many different weapons.

I'd like to see more depth in the game, but from one playthrough, I can see that it's a game welcome in my collection. At 3 players, the action was fast. There were a few rules that we goofed a couple of rules up to mid-game, but I can see how the game runs smoothly with minimal randomness. Good intuitive layout for the components too.

It was just a little too hard to pull off big turns where you could combo your weapons together.  Especially with the chaotic movement of people on the board.  If this was easier to achieve I would have rated it higher and it might still be in my collection.

Provisional rating, one play. I thought the game was well done, but I found myself not as caught up in it as I expected to be. I think a large part of this was disappointment over the very basic arena (yes, there are some options).  In my long-ago FPS days I especially liked custom map servers, enjoying designers' clever tricks and jokes, while having to learn unfamiliar terrain. I would also have liked to see a teamplay option.

RATING: 6.5
I was super hyped for this game.  I love area control games, and I love a lot of confrontations.  I think this game brilliantly distilled the two into a fast-paced and thematic game with some clever combo's and scoring... however... it's just not exciting.  Like, it's fun to play while you're playing it, but it never felt particularly satisfying when finished, nor did I feel excited to play again.  It's kind of a thinky, beer and pretzels game that's fun for an hour, but not something I can't wait to play again.

RATING: 7
Liked this game quite a bit despite the theme not appealing to me.

Gameplay SHOULD be fast, but you have to play with people who aren't prone to AP or this game takes closer to 1.5hrs than the 30-60 shown on BGG. If your game group takes a while to make decisions, this is not the game for you.

When gameplay is snappy though – the game is an excellent rollercoaster of fun and frags.

A first person shooter board game that works pretty well.   Plays pretty fast as it should based on the theme.  Pick up a weapon, move, fire, injure others - repeat.   Not a lot of min/maxing going on here.  Fun for what it is.

" I’m sure almost everyone has played an area control game before, but when was the last time you had to chase that area down a corridor with a flamethrower?"
http://www.creakingshelves.com/first-impressions-of-adrenaline/

A perfect game with no tension.
Perfectly balanced, rules are fine and there's no PDP at all but it's a plate experience.
Hope this is not the new direction from CGE games, understand the need to be open to a wider market like the American one but this game is neither fish nor flesh.
I don't know why, probably my taste, but there's no tension to play this game.
1. Why a so large map? A small one give a better view of the whole situation.
I try to print in on a A4
2. Icon on weapons cards not really clarify what that card do.
3. Manual could be written better, also don't suggest some strategy.

I reserve to change my idea with more play.
________________________________

Il gioco ha il suo fascino come per tutti quei giochi dove ci si muove su una mappa e ci si mazzùla, ma rimane il dubbio legato alle carte. le armi sono tante e troppo diverse per essere ricordate tutte e si gioca l'intera partita con le stesse armi più per la pigrizia di impararne delle nuove che altro. anche se il gioco suggerirebbe di equipaggiarsi di armi nuove ogni volta per risparmiare sulle munizioni e per adattarsi alla situazione di gioco.
ma ripeto le armi sono troppe e diversificate ed è difficile tenerle tutte sotto controllo tra quelle disponibili e quelle in mano per compiere la scelta migliore.
allora succede che il gioco lo si gioca senza troppo impegno, non ha convinto a pieno purtroppo le aspettative erano alte. il manuale è scritto in stile americano e anche questo confonde.
voto da pensarci su, per il momento un 7.5

Played this at a convention and immediately fell in love with the game. I like how much this game recreates the excitement I had when I used to play those tactical first-person shooters on the PC. Having a doublesided board gives this game a decent replayability, along with many different weapons. Highly recommended if you're a fan of first-person shooters.

Played this on 4/22/2017 and loved it.  Played a 4 player game and it was fairly straight forward and easy to understand/teach.  Felt very much like a shooter and I liked that you can't just hide in a room somewhere and camp, just not an option in this game and I really liked that there was no point in gaining up on one single person the whole game because they are worth less and less points the more they are killed.  The weapons were very cool, the ones we played with I didn't really feel any of them were "OP (overpowered)" and it felt great when you could pay for the secondary abilities and make some cool combos work.  Was able to get some triple strikes with the T.H.O.R and it felt great.  Very enjoyable game and even though you die it doesn't really matter, respawn and get back to it !

RATING: 6
On one hand, I don't think you could do a better job of bringing a Halo-styled video game shooter to the tabletop. Adrenaline has it all. Dozens of weapons with unique effects, resource management in the form of crate drops and ammo reloads, overkills and spawn camping. Well, that last one isn't so much a perk as the rest, but it makes it feel like a very apt translation. This is all connected with a bit of Euro VP scoring, which seems strange, but actually works quite well. The game is a whole lot of fun.

On the other hand, it is also sort of repetitive and pointless, again, as shooters often are. Kills are the only objective, so really there is no reason to do anything but try and overkill easy targets that are already half dead. The map is also incredibly small. You are never more than a space or two from having line of site to everyone on the map, so tactical positioning really doesn't exist.

So I'm pretty much 50/50 on this one. I won't buy it, because I'm just not that big of a shooter fan. I'll absolutely play it though, if anyone offers up their copy for some table time.

FPS goes to the table top. Men on map skirmish with humorous over the top weapons and card driven action and combat--no dice. Skill game. Manage resources, load weapons, no stock piling.  The cool thing for me is your hits are scored as blood tokens on opponent player health tracks. Bonus points for first damage, most damage, kill shot. And bonus points for the overkill. A decent job at capturing the rush and feel of FPS.

RATING: 8
A fairly enjoyable shooter, with some Euro elements thrown in. Pick up weapons, ammo and power-ups so that you can blast your friends, but you also need to maximize your turns to hit the most players. A bit fiddly with some of the scoring, but a fun game.

It felt a little like the game was playing itself in a 2 player game as there was often only 1 person to go for at any given time. That being said, with experience, maybe that would clear up as you would have a better idea of what weapons worked best in various circumstances. Non the less I did enjoy it and would like to play again with more people (or even with 2) to get a better feel for strategies.
Despite it's euro flavour, I found the game very thematic and this makes up for some of the apparent lack of strategy somewhat.

Really like this one, I do think it is a tad too expensive for the components.
I had reservations about the map size but it is fine.
There is possibility for AP though.
Other than that it was fun to figure out every round how to whip out the most pain to your foes. A cd soundtrack of the likes of Unreal Tournament would be a great addition, as would a 3 minute turn timer :P.
Very clean rule set, I just wished an extra reference sheet was included.
Looking up the weapons can stop the flow of the game.

A fun, not-too-hard Euro in a thematic disguise. The theme makes it accessible for many people that would normally not play this kind of game, while there is definitely enough in there to keep it interesting. Playing it 'in the spirit of the game' makes it especially fun. If people want to know exactly what every weapon does beforehand, rules explanations can take a while.

I was totally surprised by this one. Gameplay is fun and turns are relatively quick once everyone understands the game. I do wish the game included multiple booklets or small player aids that explain each weapon. Since it does not, I'd advise using one from the BGG files section as it will make gameplay go much quicker since you're not passing the one included book back and forth.

I would really love to have a first person eurogame but this attempt is just very boring and shallow. Not only is playing this with 5 very AP prone, it's one of those games I wished would end when I played it. I tried hard to find any strategy, it all comes down to being lucky enough so you can kill someone who has been damaged enough by the other players or taking part in a very boring game of point grab by spreading dmg. 

The map is too small you always can shoot anyone. There are no tactical elements on the map, ammo spawns in each room and is always available. Each character is the same, no variable powers. They nailed the weapons though, they are the only positive thing in this game.  

This is too shallow for a eurogame, too boring for its theme and too long for what it offers.

A smart collection of small game designs tied to a set of pyramid pieces (a piece set with multiple games available). Icetowers and Gnostica are my favorites, with a soft spot for Zendo as a design more than a game.

How do you rate a set of pieces? By the average quality of all the games you can typically play with them? 

I suppose. 

I like the pieces, but my experience with Icehouse games is largely meh.

I want to spend more time with the cool bits, but no one I know will play.  Ice house sucks, but some of the other games (Ice Traders/Homeworld) are very cool...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Each game has a different rating.  I have only found one that I really like.  The rules are too obscure for the rest of the games (actually I get bored reading all of the rules and realizing that I cannot play the game by myself).

RATING: 9
Almost full set of pyramids:
Transparent Red, Pink, Orange, Yellow, Green, Light Blue, Dark Blue, Purple, Clear (but not Chartreuse or Magenta)
Opaque Black, White, Grey

RATING: 6
In my one play, I really did not get it until the final scoring.  By then, I had been Icehoused.  I think I need to try it again now that I know what's going on.  Rating could change.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not yet played.  Not sure what I would do with the pieces away way.  It seems to have too many variations with too many rules for so few pieces that I worry that the games are just thrown together as after thoughts to a set of game pieces that were made.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
More of a mythology than a game, but enjoyable a few times. Owning a set does provide a large # of options, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating is for the IceHouse pieces and is an amalgam of the games I have played/do play with them. Terrific abstract gaming system.

I'm confused as to whether to rate all the different Icehouse games I've ever played, or just Icehouse, which I've never played... I guess I'll rate the sum total.

I'm confused as to whether to rate Icehouse the game (which I haven't played) or the many good games that use Icehouse pieces (some of which I have played), including Zendo which I love.  So I'll leave this at an 8 for Zendo.

Actually, now that I think about it, I really love Gnostica.  I'll leave this at a 9 for Gnostica, plus one extra point since there are several other good  Icehouse games that I rate as 7s or better.
  
I have all 10 regular stashes, and also cyan (from the boxed IceTowers).  I might start getting the rest of the sets, for the extras in them and so I can have multiple pyramid sets around.  I'm really getting hooked on these things... 
  
I keep this game around, because it's not so much a game as a game system, with plenty of great games to play---even if you never played anything outside of Playing with Pyramids.  The plastic pieces are extremely durable (I tumbled one set in a  dryer practically alone once on no-heat, and none of the pieces had broken or even scratched.  And they stack well and look very, very nice.

RATING: 9
Icehouse pyramid games tend to have some things in common:
1. They break common conventions like taking turns or playing on a board.
2. At first glance, they look like nonsensical novelties.
3. The more you play the more you realize they are deep, skill-driven games.
Some people may hate those things, but I love them.

As for the specific game called Icehouse, the last play made it very apparent that in a group where people realize the benefit of waiting for others to move first, there need to be some measures to force you to play. Next time I'll have to see if I can get a timer of unknown duration as the rules suggest.

RATING: 4
Four different sleeves plus the book

Maybe this gets better with abstractions but played 2-player with my wife, I couldn't get into it.  While part of the reason is that she hates abstract games, the game turned me off too, to the point that I won't pull this out to try with other gamers.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Rating for the game itself:  6.5, based on one 2-player game.  Both players were new to the game.  I suspect it's more interesting with 4 experienced players and hope to find out some day.  I have six (non-stackable) paper stashes assembled; I have also used them to play Gnostica and Homeworlds.

I've only played Icehouse once and to be honest it reminds me of that game my family used to play in a restaurant when the food took too long and we stacked our hands on top of one anothers then the person on the bottom would pull theirs out and put it on top until we got going faster and faster and then it all fell apart in a mess of giggles.  Now that was fun!  Icehouse really isn't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Ice towers is a great 1 minute filler game, Ice House an excellent abstract game, and the Zen-Eleusis variation is a kick. Most of the games playable with this piece-set have been fun to play, and the variations are as limitless as for a deck of cards.

Incredibly useful, and just begging for more designs.  I can play two games I really enjoy with them, and playtest my own when I need pieces.

RATING: 6
Icehouse proper is an odd game -- cerebral, but not always engaging to me (rating 6). But as a gaming system, the pyramids give supreme bang-for-buck (rating 10). Lots of games can be played with these pyramids, but as people have been adding them to the database, I'll just rate Icehouse here.

Played 1 game of Powerhouse and 2 of Ice Dice with Andy Looney at Dragonmeet 2009.

Hence recording the plays under the generic Icehouse entry for the time being.

Not just a game, a game system.  Literally hundreds of games can be played with these aesthetically pleasing little pyramids.

Played once.  Icehouse is an odd bird of a game, that is difficult to learn by reading the rules; you really need to have someone teach you this game.  The pieces are cool, and can be used for all sorts of other games, and IN other games as well.

RATING: 7
This is perhaps the mother of all real-time games.  It is an interesting challenge and uses the wonderful pyramids by Andrew Looney.  That being said, I have to admit that I am not very good at IceHouse.

The downside is, abstracts do not appeal to all players.  Also, realtime games definitely favor the experienced.  This game gives little chance of inexperienced players winning.  

The pieces are great, and the advantage to it is as a "game system", with Zendo being on the top of my list.  These pyramids are just fun to play with, and can be used to implement other games (such as Quarto, Gobblet, Chess, etc.)

A very good idea. This system can handle lots of abstract games. 

Despite having teorically hundreds of games, the initial rage of Icehouse game development has ended, and many of the developed games are bad. So, for the price of 5 Rainbow and 5 Xeno Treehouses, you get (imho) about 50 okay abstract games, and 10 of them are truly good.

There's a steep learning curve for this game.  Two learning curves, actually: one to learn how to play and another to learn how to play well.  It's nothing at all like Chess, but it reminds me of Chess in that it seems to be more work than it's worth.

I've only played this twie so far, so my rating and weight may change. It's a game I'd like to try more, but the first times (playing with other first-timers) it felt like we never got to any deeper strategies and couldn't quite figure out how to get to the defensive measures.

Martian Chess Set edition '99.  This is a very unique 'gaming system' including 4 seperate game rules (IceTowers, IceTraders, MartianChess, & Zarcana).  The rules for the actual 'Icehouse' game can be found on-line.  Given the flexibility this entire set of colored pyramids offers with the variety in additional game rules on-line, I give it a collective rating of 9 as a game-system!  (Mega-Volcano, Gnostica and now Homeworlds being current household favorites).  This is a great initial and cost-effective investment as more colored sets of pyramids may be added to facilitate the growing collection of 100+ games made available on-line through the Looney Labs website.  The book "Playing with Pyramids" is a must-have publication.

RATING: N/A
I [i]want[/i] to like this game, but I think it probably helps to play it with someone good.  My friends weren't as into it as I was, I think, and a couple players don't like real-time games.

Update: you want to know how cool this game can be?  From the great but deleted GeekList "Balthus Dire's great gaming stories:"

[q="Balthus_Dire"]In the midst of a particularly difficult time personally (soon after I turned 30), I decided to simplify my life somewhat and move into a Buddhist meditation centre in northern Vermont, to live and work. In addition to playing a lot of Go during my free time, I also discovered the wonderful game of Icehouse.

I had bought the Icehouse set years before, but hadn't tried it--I got it after seeing the amazing spectacle of a human-sized set being played at a con in southern California. It's a real-time game played to a hidden, previously decided upon time limit. I had a (self made) large bright red five by four foot table with rounded corners in my room that was very low, around which I used to sit with others on meditation cushions to play--the perfect set up.

We took the game very seriously, like a meditation. The game was played mostly in silence (except for calls of 'overiced', etc.), and it usually began with an extended period of electric alertness, no one moving at all, as we tried to gauge the last possible moment that we could reasonably play while still having enough time to get our pieces out. Playing before another is a disadvantage, as they can play to attack your pieces as you put them out--the trick is that to attack you must have vulnerable pieces out as well. At some unspoken point one of us would go off like a rocket, and we would all be engaged in a tremendous flurry of activity by the end of the game, moving in and around each other's arms and bodies as we strove to make strong placements at lightning speed without losing our focus. Yet even this frenzy somehow felt graceful, as if we were working against each other, but somehow together as well.

I've never played game sessions that were as absorbing since, and I still think about those games of Icehouse. There was some combination of the place, the players and the game that was really powerful. It makes me feel like immersion is the real key ingredient for me, the reason I play games--but not just immersion in the game, immersion also in the players and situation, in the entire experience. I like the mutual creation of and investment in another world--the deeper the better. A world that one can and does long for after it's gone.[/q]

RATING: 10
(I'm rating the Icehouse game system, not the actual game itself) The Icehouse game system is a great idea. With just 60 little pyramids, you can play all kinds of fun games, ranging from Zendo, a wonderfully original logic game, to Gnostica, a fascinating strategy game with just enough randomness, to Volcano, an abstract strategy/puzzle game, to RAMbots, a programming game, to Ice Towers, a real time, turnless game, and on and on, with hundreds of games available online, and more games being created all the time in Icehouse game design contest.

If you enjoy pattern recognition you should enjoy this lightweight game. I don't enjoy pattern recognition, so this was was kind of so-so. The whole Icehouse family games is definitely an interesting concept, but the basic game is just kind of meh.

I absolutely love my Icehouse set.  If you toy around with game design, take note, this is one of the best tools you can have to design with.  I have all ten colors of pyramids, they are aestetically pleasing, and here's the best part:  you can use them to play a hundreds of games.  You go to the "s.l.i.c.k." list at looney labs website, and you can download a ton of rules, from simple variants of classic games, to real time strategy games.  They aremore like a deck of cards, in this respect than a game: they are "Game System".  By the way, if you are interested enough to try buying some of these off the looney labs website, do me a favor and list my name (Scott Josephus) as the person you heard about this game from.  I love my Icehouse set.  

One word of caution though: Looney Labs has recently changed the way they've been selling the pieces, so now it comes one of two mixed color sets called Treehouse.  To Play most of the games, you'll want to get about five of the same colored sets at about $8 each (so about $40), but there are many games you can play with just two or three sets, or even one!  The more sets you have, the more variety in the number of games you can play.

Judging from the comments, most ratings are for the system, not the game. My rating is for the game.

[gameid=5534], apparently inspired by this game, is an improvement. Some of Icehouse's rules seem out-of-place in a frantic realtime game, like distance limitations (for attacks) and pieces counts (for calling "Icehouse").

This rating is for the Game System. I recently got 5 sets of Threehouse stashes to build a complete set of 5 colors. I've been trying the games in the book Playing with Pyramids and am quite amazed. I didn't expect such a simple looking system to have so much variety and depth. Combine the pyramids with all sorts of boards and stuff (like a piecepack set which I also rate a 10) and the possibilities are almost endless.

I especially liked the games Volcano, Ram-bots and Zendo.

My score reflects the fact that I know and play not only a lot of pyramid games but a lot of pyramid games that combine with other types of components. If you put effort into getting the most out of the pyramids, they'll reward you heavily. I think they're best for serious gamers.

Many of the games have interesting twists, and in particular, the &quot;turnless&quot; versions are intriguing. But most of the games are badly broken, and those that aren&#039;t onlt get a couple of games worth of play.

RATING: 8
This is my entry for Icehouse pieces and the overall Icehouse "system," not the game Icehouse. Like Hoyle games, I prefer not to inflate my games owned list with multiple games that use the same (or nearly the same) set of components -- a deck of cards for card games, Icehouse pyramids for icehouse games.

For Icehouse games I get a bit more granular because some require additional stuff. So I list Volcano as owned because I have a Volcano board, but not (say) Homeworlds because that one just uses pyramids, which I've already listed once. Does it really matter? Probably not!

---

As much as I enjoy some Icehouse games (especially Volcano), having to track down my Plano box, play mat, and printed rules, rather than just grabbing a complete game in a box, means that my pieces tend to stay on the shelf.

Still an 8, but now in storage and not a go-to core game/set of games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A really enjoyable game, complete with total insanity. Not necessarily for everyone, but I like it. One thing I have issue with is the ability to have "icehouse" called upon you when you already placed all of your pieces on the board. This does not encourage the faced paced play that I utilize.

Brilliant game design system from the loons at Looney Labs: pyramid-shaped pieces in three sizes and many different colors that stack on top of each other AND nest inside each other: elegant, ingenious stuff.

Of the dozens and dozens of games designed to utilize these pieces, several are very good indeed, including [i]Zendo[/i] and [i]Volcano[/i]. Both of these games use the special features of the pieces to very good effect. [i]Alien City[/i] is another good game, but merely uses the pieces as markers. I have one of my tarot decks all prepared for [i]Gnostica[/i], but have yet to play. I would also love to try the original [i]Icehouse[/i] game; finding the players among my friends is the problem. The book [i]Playing With Pyramids[/i] is very well done, a must read.

Finally got to play the Granddaddy of pyramid games at NonCon 2008 (Thanks Marc, Keira and Iain!).  Played multiple games, one after another, and wasn't as terrible as I thought I might be!  Even got a share of a win in one game, and scored competitivly in every game.

This really is almost more sport than boardgame, and needs a certain mindset from its players.  That said, I can't imagine I would ever turn down a game if there were Icehouse fans available.

Looking forward to playing much more, and practicing all of the complex strategies I have read about, but only just begun to really grasp now that I have my first games under my belt.

My Icehouse set is the star of my gaming kit.  There is such a variety of good games that can be played with these little pyramids that I'm almost always up for one of them.  I use them more often than my Poker deck.  When I first came to BGG back in 2003, few of these games had their own entries, so I rated Icehouse a 10 to reflect the fact that I was always up for a game using the Icehouse pyramids (even though Icehouse itself wasn't usually that game).  It's the only 10 rating I've ever given.

Since then, most Icehouse games have gotten their own entries, allowing me to rate them individually.  I'm therefore reducing my rating of Icehouse to a 6, to reflect the fact that I don't actually care to play the original game itself very often.  Instead, I'm giving my 10 rating to the book "Playing with Pyramids," which contains the rules for a dozen good games (including Icehouse itself), which can be played using a set of Icehouse pyramids.

Key to the game seems to be getting prisoners which allow you to more actively counter attacks.  Suspect diplomacy with other players is the key to this as it opens to the door to prisoners.  As well as strictly enforcing the crash rule to similarly force prisoners to other players.  Otherwise, seems a bit like a stand-off, stare-down where no one wants to move.

I've heard it was an inspiration for Lightspeed. It seems more strategic than Lightspeed (that's good) but when we played it the first couple of times, it was confusing real-time chaos, with players confused about strategy.

Based on what I've read, it's just a matter of getting used to it, and it seems worth pursuing, since the game clearly has a dedicated following, annual tournament, many articles published, etc. It seems to be part of the Icehouse pyramid culture, for obvious reasons. :)

Meanwhile, for easier to learn real-time pyramid action, I have found [gameid=9386] to be quite fun, fast, and popular! I think I'd recommend starting with it instead of Icehouse.

Yeah yeah, you can play a million games with the bits. Whatever. I only have time for the sublime game of Icehouse, the game that birthed the pieces, the real time placement game that I would only misrepresent if I tried to describe the rules. An emotional description instead: Playing in the past has allowed entrance into a sort of a fugue state, a state of calm hyper-awareness, where everything is felt but nothing is known...the hidden time limit, too much information and lack of turns means you have to feel the energies of the pieces as they move, feel the intentions of others as they move, engaging in a kind of a dance as you move in and around each other, sweat falling from your brow in concentration and exertion. Play with 3 only, on a not too small round table. serious gamers, but sensitive. YOu will not regret it.

How do I rate something like this?  This doesn't just represent this game, but all the games you can play with Icehouse pieves.  Unfortunately, they don't come out as often as I would like.  They don't compete with the other games for shelf space, so they don't stand out when its time to pick a game.  Even then, when I do remember them, I would have to actually pick a game after picking the game pieces.  Still, none of that is a knock on the game system, and I am very gladd that I have them.  I need to resolve to get them on the table.

RATING: 10
On about late 1992 I was a junior in high school and prone to sneak out of my parents' home to attend local Washington DC area punk shows.  While waiting outside of these shows people would walk around handing out flyers of various sizes, shapes, and colors. From flyers for other shows, flyers for other clubs, political flyers, and zines I'd collect them all and paste them on my bedroom wall. One humid summer night while standing outside of the Peace Center in DC (waiting for a Nation of Ulysses show -- one of their last) I was handed a flyer that was unlike any that I had ever received; a little purple flyer for a game called Icehouse. The game was shrouded in mysterious trappings but it was as a Chess player the idea of a new strategic game that grabbed my imagination.  However, there was only an address to "learn more" and so I didn't take the effort to follow through on it and instead just pasted it to my wall. However, a friend of mine got the same flyer at the same show and did follow through by writing in for more information and eventually ordering a set.

Now at the time my friends and I would spend weekend nights skating at Glen Burnie High School and then eventually wind up at Denny's to drink coffee and play card games (mostly to drink coffee).  One night my friend pulled out a lovely little felt bag containing a whole mess of poorly stained wooden Icehouse pyramids.  We noodled our way through the rules and started playing. Of course we had no idea what we were doing, but the game "felt" fun. After a few more nights of this we were hooked and played for many months after that until Hearts eventually loosened Icehouse's grip on our hearts.  From what I remember, we didn't really understand all of the rules so we just adjusted a few of the gnarly parts to suit our needs.  For example, I'm pretty sure we didn't play with "walls" and we also played partnerships almost always.  I remember that as the temperature got colder the wooden pieces were harder to hold with dry hands and so there were frequent "crashes" making the game somewhat frustrating.  Those were good times regardless, and I remember having an utter blast talking trash with friends late into the night while drunks and the lonely at other tables looked at us in wonder (and would occasionally come over to see what was what) as we giggled our nights away.

An interesting, quick, real-time game that offers strategic possibilities not evident at first.

Can't rate this - I have icehouse-the-material, but don't play icehouse-the-game. See Gnostica, Zendo. Note to self: (Get a chessboard and) play Rambots.

There are a lot of fun games you can play with Icehouse pieces, and I've enjoyed owning a set. However, it can be hard to get other players interested since most Icehouse games have a very abstract look.

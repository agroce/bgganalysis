Nertz = Multiplayer Solitaire.

Not only have I never won this game, I have gotten last place every single time I have played.  I hate this game.

RATING: 5.5
This is multi-player solitaire defined. It's frantic and easy. My family is very willing to play at this point, so I find myself at the table as well - not all together unwillingly. It's fine for what it delivers.

great speed game... especially for 2 players.  I've always used regular decks of cards.  It usually takes me a few rounds to get my brained "warmed-up" to Nertz speed.  Related games include Dutch Blitz & Ligretto.

Can last a really long time with a large group. Might be more fun with 3-4 (we played with like 6), but it's interesting and I'll play it every once in a while. Good family game for non-gamers. I find the more I play it, the less I like it

Generic version of Dutch Blitz.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Step aside Dutch Blitz and Ligretto - Nerts has far more to offer!

I had been thinking about getting a copy of Dutch Blitz for a long time. A friend from college had one, and I really enjoyed the game. Then I learned about Ligretto, it's more colorful, less provincial cousin from Europe... All of Ligretto's splash and style came at a cost - a literal cost - usually 150% ~ 200% the cost of Dutch Blitz...

But before I pulled the trigger on the one-trick pony of the farmland game, I discovered Nerts.... Nerts, which is played with *normal playing cards*! Nerts, which doesn't limit itself to one game - but actually can play *all the games*! Every playing card game you can think of - from Poker to Rummy, from Old Maid to Crazy 8s, from Solitaire to 52-card pick up... it's all here! AND you can play Nerts, the open-source, public domain, free-to-all, ethnic-neutral version of Dutch Blitz / Ligretto.

Not only that - but having these matched decks of playing cards, that only differ on the color of their cardbacks, mean you can, if you are so inclined, use them to play games like Scan or Indiscretion, where the backs of the cards tell you want suit the card is. Just pick 4 of the 6 supplied colors and get one suit from each color and play the game.

There are so many possibilities here, it was a no-brainer. The cards are nice, not quite Bicycle-brand quality, you won't use these for any special magic tricks - but they are decent enough. I'm very happy with my purchase, and I think you will be too.

This seems to be the game I know as "double solitaire."  This was THE game my sister-in-law grew up playing, and consequently, she is a lightning-fast, unstoppable juggernaut of victory.  I'm getting better, though!  Our tradition now is to play one game every year; whenever we meet throughout the year, we play some hands and keep a running score.  The game ends on New Year's Eve, and we play until the ball drops in Times Square.  This can also be played with more people; the 4-player game seems to be more forgiving and have higher scores.

Would consider an official new deck of Nertz or Dutch Blitz as a gift for a friend of mine who loves the game.

Reminds me a lot of Dutch Blitz, also Double Solitaire but with up to 4 players.  Really don't care for speed games, although used to play them by hours as a kid.  It is one of those games my non-gaming family will play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast-paced game like speed that uses a standard deck of playing cards per player. (Each deck should have a different colored back for ease of scoring though.) Four players seems great for teaching newbies. The game works well with 4-6 players. Any more than that, and the cards fly faster than most people would like. With 3, you are more likely to run into times where you cannot play anything and are stuck waiting on everyone else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At least a solid 7. A great excuse to buy several standard card decks with different backs.

This is great fun and easy to learn, especially since almost everyone has been addicted to computer solitaire at one point. I would strongly recommend this one for gaming with the extended family.

So I don't have this game, but I have played Nertz with several decks of Bicycles cards.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this  game.  The first time I played, a group of my friends and I took over the back of a restaurent near our college and played from 8pm until 1:45am.  The only reason we stopped was to get back to school in time for out 2am curfew.  The most fun I had in college.

Almost the same game as dutch blitz but better since you can play with as many players as you have decks of cards but with different backs.Must be quick with the hands in this one.Only down side is some players are very fast and can be tough to beat which could be discouraging for slower players.Game can be played with 2 players but can get bogged down.Try to play at least 3 or more.

With the right group, this game is a blast.  Your eyes almost hurt from frantically scanning the different piles.

I'm listing this as "owned" even though we play with a bunch of different casino card decks, mainly to ease in entering games played.

Update 6/10: Since I first rated this game, it has become a staple in our gaming group, the game that we play the most often, just about every time we meet.  My wife went into labor with our 4th child playing this game.  It seems destined to be a family and group favorite for years to come.  Up to a 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Everyone has a different deck and essentially plays a speed solitaire - competing for card positions in the center piles.

The Good: Can be fast and furious action. Manually racing other people through cards. Takes a lot of energy and constant attention to what other people are doing around you. 

The Bad: It is just speed solitaire. Luck of the draw is huge. Very stressful environment as everyone has to be ultra alert in order to play their cards in the center before the others. 

The Ugly: Playing solitaire should not be a stressful and frustrating experience. It's just wrong !!

When I was in the 6th grade, I used to play this regularly with a friend of mine.  We played that the first person to exhaust his or her draw pile was the winner.

God help me!!!  My wife's family loves this.  It's not terrible, but it reminds me of PIT in that I get really tired of it after a little while and would like something a little slower and more low-key.  Add this to the fact that I don't like it as much as PIT and that's why it get's the 6...

RATING: 4
Game in a Nutshell: The original multiplayer-solitaire, literally. Only in this game there's no taking turns, just an all out race to go out first.

Played as: 4-12 players, solo and teams.

Pros: A good game any moderately active person would play at a larger gathering. Can be played in teams of two incorporating a large group. Better then most commercial 'party games' and can be played with any cheapy decks of cards.

Cons: Not a relaxing game-- one that I think raises my blood pressure. Can be effected by luck. Sometimes a problem scrapping together the numbers of decks needed to play. Also expect cards to be sacrificed to destruction in the heat of play.

Best Use: At parties... seems like (fun) chicks especially love it too.

Maybe it's nostalgia talking, but this is my favorite speed game. I grew up playing this for hours on summer days with half the neighborhood on my living room floor. My sister and I packed decks of cards for every vacation so we could play it at motels and relatives' houses. It's delightfully frantic. With the uninitiated I will pull out Ligretto or Dutch Blitz, but the original (to me) version played with a standard 52-card deck is still the best.

Played with normal decks of cards, not any published game. 

This is a game my wife's family plays a lot. As it's basically just a game of reflexes, it's clearly not for everyone. If you're similarly matched in terms of speed with an opponent (e.g., my wife and myself, or several other family members), it can be a lot of fun.

Played as "Multiple Handed Solitaire" growing up, however "Solitaire Frenzy" would be the closest name.

Improves the boring monotony of Solitaire with the speed and competition vs other players.  Always a blast blocking people.  Fixes the Solitaire issue of going through the deck multiple times.

Cards can be easily damaged when two players are going for the same spot.  Slower players will not like this version.

RATING: 8
The game of Nertz I learned only allowed your 13 draw pile cards to be played to empty slots in your four card tableau as they remained upside down until played.  I never enjoyed this much.  I learned a similar game, called Squeak, prior to this which allowed the draw pile cards (which were face up) to be played anywhere legal.  I found this to be much more frantic, exciting, and fun.  We played many, many games of this back in my high school days.  I would happily play now, but I believe I am much too slow :)  The rating I have is for this latter game.

The official Nertz cards are horrible.  The artwork is terrible.  They're uncoated and flimsy.The game itself is a public domain children's game that is mildly entertaining for a brief amount of time.  There's essentially no strategy. It's basically a competitive solitaire variant that's mostly about speed and which cards you're lucky enough to have turn up in the deck.I'm sure a lot of people have fond memories of playing this as a kid but really, there are far, far better games out there.

Sigh.  My wife and her family love this ridiculous game.  It's multiplayer solitaire, but not in the traditional meaning on BGG.  You play this as fast as possible.

It's not a terrible game, but I lose interest after about 4 hands.

Okay game. Too similar to Dutch Blitz though, which is a fantastic game. I'm not in favor of the partner factor. I like how in Dutch Blitz, you are in control of everything, and don't have to worry about a slow partner or something of that nature. You only have yourself to blame.

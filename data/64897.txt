Man, I love this game from when I was a teenager. I played hundreds of times and almost knew the best trajectories of the tracks I owned without even looking at them. It probably has mechanisms that aged now, considered its age and I do not play it much nowadays, but... this still has me dreaming.

Together with Speed Circuit, the King of F1 games. Ideally played on a full season with 2 cars per player and 5 to 8 players. Less strategic than Speed Circuit but as much fun. Very nice circuits. One of the best racing games ever !

I love this game!
Spend all my hard earn money acquiring the tracks back in France in the 90's - even made a swoop for the missing ones in my collection, when I learned about the bankruptcy of the game editor - drove 3 hours up to a small shop who had them all - geeky, but devoted!
Even joined the Formule Dé Club and got the coveted Mexico track (A big piece of white, folded paper with a black, printed track, no additional graphics or colours!). 
A truly proud moment in my meaningless life..

Un très sympathique jeu de course et de gestion, aux règles et variations multiples. Un peu trop technique pour moi, tout de même.

Brilliant Motor racing game. Although seems under rated by many people - yet has a wide variety of tracks and options.

Very entertaining game. As announced in the title, don't play Formule Dé if dice aren't your friends !

Discovered this game with a French friend - I imagine with the name, that it's a French-origin game. Great to have the possibility of multiple tracks.

Pretty long laps tend to make this game long&repetitive. 'Thinkers' make it worse. My advice is to force people to move as soon as they are up: in real racing you also have to make split-second decisions

The best offering in GMT's [family=54][/family]  series.  I was worried that it would be bland and generic, but no way.  The C&C breakdown, rules on heat, Washington relieving Lee of Command provide a lot of unique features to this game, and the variation insures that nearly every game will be unique -- something that Brandywine, Guilford, and Saratoga cannot promise.  The map is a beauty and provides a lot of possibilities in mastering the terrain benefits.

This is a fairly good system which is easy to grasp and enjoyable. The Campaign is the best part. Scenarios play well only as introduction to the game. It is relatively solitaire friendly. Components and rule book are as usual with GMT excellent.

RATING: 4
It seems to me that for the Americans in Monmouth, the first seven turns (i.e. half the game) are only about minimising their morale losses. What this means is staying away from the British.  Thanks to the command and control rules, your chances of mounting a coordinated attack on them are remote anyway.  Happily, the British are hamstrung by a rearguard manouevre zone, so staying away from them is not at all difficult.  You should also get your units off the roads to prevent them from double countermarching off the map due to the aforementioned command and control.  Does this sound tedious and gamey?  Yes it is.

When the tedium is over, this system does seem to simulate the linear warfare of the period quite well.  The close combat rules emphasise the importance of protecting your flanks. Taking two player turns in a row, based on initiative rolls, can be very powerful indeed.  It was critical to the British victory in my first game.

Another reservation I have is with the overall level of fiddliness.  The prime offender is the drawing and comparison of tactics chits before every combat.  It really slows the game down, while often making little difference. Added to that are a fair number of special rules and exceptions.

Artwork and production quality are to the standard you would expect from GMT.

Monmouth is a good addition to it.
I really enjoyed it.

C&C rules are great but can be heavy frustrating for the American player. Hard to win for the rebels either.

The British army is very capable and tends to win most times.

RATING: 8
Another great game in a very good game series.  This one might even topple Brandywine as my favorite game in the series. The larger size of Monmouth comes with pros and cons.  It means that a handful of lucky or unlucky CRT rolls is less likely to dictate the course of the game, as it did in smaller games like Saratoga and Guilford. This is a good thing. The trade off is that the larger number of combat units bogs down the game.  

The game specific C&C rules for the Americans are a nice touch, and they are seamlessly integrated. Using them was second nature, even during our first play of the game.  However, they do introduce a rather heavy degree of random chaos- perhaps too much chaos for a game with so much strategy involved otherwise. For example, in our first game I rolled "no movement" for Scott's units three turns in a row. This resulted in an inability to move units of other formations up the road (since stacking is enforced at all times during the game turn).  Thus my forces could not make it to the front in a timely fashion, and the Brits lined up much farther forward than historically, making a U.S. win a dismal dream... and before the combat had even started.

Overall, a very nice effort that will require more plays to form a solid opinion.

I enjoyed this game, but there are a few points that can be a little off-putting.  First, they really need to rethink the Tactics Chits.  The battles have enough randomness due to the morale and skill-based modified die rolls without the chits.  At the very least, I would only bother using them when there is a leader present, as they are too time consuming for what they offer.  Second, protect your high-ranking generals.  A lucky shot from American artillery killed Clinton turning a slugfest of a draw into an American VP victory.  I thought it was a historically conceivable turn of events....The British player wasn't as amused. :)

Monmouth offers another good game in an excellent series, and by far one of the most balanced scenarios a wargamer could ask for. I'd like to see the system used to cover other small battles from the 1740-1815 period. 

UPDATE: Lee rules for command and control should be thrown out. The man was not "crazy." He reacted rationally to the situation and was a victim of Washington's bad planning. He was then scapegoated.

I liked Saratoga, but this one seems rather poor.  There's a lot of fiddly moving back and forth for no real effect, the rules have some significant holes, and neither player has much of an incentive to do anything.  And while I noticed that the movement rates were far too slow in Saratoga, here the problem is nothing short of ridiculous.  If you look through the different scenarios (which start at different times during the daylong battle), you'll find units that moved farther in two turns than they could have legally moved in five turns.  Clearly not storyboarded.

Played now.  Woot.  I thought I'd like it, but it was much better than expected even.  Great mechanics, though the tactics chits are a bit tedious, and the game flows and 'feels' great!  Gorgeous, high quality components!

Much more balanced (for us) than Saratoga, but surprisingly not quite as fun. It is a longer game, and has a very enjoyable flow as the balance swings back and forth. That aspect is very historical from what little I have read.

Still, a very enjoyable game. I think in the long run there is more here and it will swap with Saratoga on my ratings.

A "3" is a harsh number, but then I wouldn't want to have to play this game again (or any other in the series, most likely).

I can see what the designer is trying to do here, and it might have worked well if I enjoyed playing wargames solitaire, but my opponent was crushed by unlucky dierolls in every instance, and the tactical chits were a unnecessary distraction that failed to add tension, bluff, and not much risk.

Many loyal fans for these games, so I would recommend anyone looking for a low complexity wargame to give something in the series a shot.

I have enjoyed the system so far. Simple turn steps with some wrinkles thrown in to make things a bit more thought-provoking. I like the defensive cannon fire step mixed into the phasing players turn.

Overall has a nice feel for this type of warfare...thought I would say that there are hardly any rifle units in this particular game, so most of the battles are fought "face-to-face"...but it works.

Plenty of chart referencing...maybe a little too much compared to some of the other games I have played. But I will be back to this one at some point to play a big scenario...

Fun, easy introductory wargame, quite stripped down to the core of what a wargame should be. Just this rock-paper-scissors mechanism chit play mechanism for resolving combat... I am just not convinced it adds much to the game beyond game time. In any case, strongly recommended for those who want to fight the American Revolution without bludgeoning themselves to death with the rulebook of Battles of the Age of Reason.

This is a preliminary rating based on solitaire plays of historical scenarios 1 & 2. The system is nice, components are good and the game seems balanced. However, I need to play more (against a live opponent that is) to give a proper rating. So far I haven't used the tactical chits. Without them it is hard to win battles. I really need the official solitaire rules from C3i magazine. However, Monmouth is a good game you can play on your own.

Another in a decent, simple series of wargames, but the lack of period feel, in the end, leaves me thinking this could be better or I need to find better.

The components are the standard fare for GMT - functional & nice looking.  The rules obviously follow the series pattern, but this one seems to have a bit more in the way of exclusive rules (I've played Saratoga, Guilford, & this one) mainly centered on American Command and Control.  In regard to this - these seem to be the one thing I recall 'most'.  The C&C rules seem to have a good part of the American army advancing, only to retreat back the way they came, then advancing, then, well you get it...  There are ways to minimize the risk, but to me it seemed gamey & overbearing.

Monmouth is an interesting battle, with varied terrain, several scenarios and a long, bloody bodycount. But the chit pulling and the wristage (I never want to roll for morale again) can become repetative in the full game. 

UPDATE: Played the shorter scenarios, and they both make for tense battles. Really enjoyed them, even if one bad turn can spell doom. The shorter scenarios, which are relatively balanced, make Monmouth a pretty good intro to the series - while still satisfying the groganrds who like the big battle.

Grabbed this game from GMT's Warehouse Sale.  What a STEAL!

Monmouth is a great intro to the BAR series.  The map and counters are great.  The play is simple but nuanced enough to be deep.  It's at a nice level of depth.

Seems historically accurate in my view.  Cannot wait to get more series titles.

Monmouth was a large (by Revolutionary War standards) and complex battle so the game grafts some command and control rules onto the basic ruleset to capture the confusion of the battlefield. My initial reaction to these rules was negative but after playing through them I thought they worked out OK. I am starting to dislike the tactical chit draw portion of the combat system. I just don't think it adds much to the game and slows play. It wasn't really noticable in Guilford Courthouse, but it makes a difference in this larger battle. Balance also seems an issue. I don't know how the Americans can win this unless they get no effect command rolls and can get into the rear of the British Army. Once British reinforcements arrive the US has a steep challenge on its hands.

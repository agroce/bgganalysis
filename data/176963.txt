轉珠概念，真的會有種連鎖快感，不過有個問題就是，其實各種建築的效能並不大，特別是鴉片館。

Gather resources by making 3 and 4 in-a-rows. Not for the AP prone!

RATING: 7
Much lighter than I expected.
Sort of like a ConnectFour with 4 colors
where players flip and switch the pieces for form 3 or 4 in a row,
and more importantly a more 3 or 4 in a row after the 1st row is flipped.
Cubes are rewarded for each orthogonal line.
After that it's a Splendor-like use of cubes to buy buildings and ships.

What makes this fun to me is to force myself to move within 30 to 60 seconds.
AP can really slow it down - looking for that optimal move.
Thing is, if you are playing against someone who is just much better at spotting the patterns - then you just get less cubes and hence less points.  It's all about the pattern.  I enjoy seeking out the opportunities so I like this game, but some who miss or don't like the abstract element at the heart of the game may not like it as much.

第一次參與國產桌遊募資就是這款了，具文化色彩的主題及富有特色的復古美術，相當有趣的轉珠機制，配上資源轉換，實際玩起來真的不錯，但是以家庭遊戲來說，遊戲時間太長了。平衡度似乎也做得不好，鴉片流比較強，有些可惜呀!

This looks like a simple game and you will assume that you understand collecting resources and buying cards, but you don't. :-) Getting high on opium seems like a good idea, but it really is only if you can get everyone else to do it as well. This game has intriguing decisions at each turn. Turns can require thought and it's hard to plan ahead, so after your learning game, have an incredibly simple side game going for the downtime between turns. This will get better with more plays -- less downtime -- and the rewards of the game are worth that slight annoyance.

It has a light family game vibe to it, but turns out to be a gamer's game. Family games don't have opium, you know. Can also get very heavy on AP. Overall you have a pretty simple and beautiful mechanism for getting resources, but you can't plan your turn ahead before the player on your right gets his resources and optimizing this system can take a while. Points for properly done playtesting as there is a rule included for stopping infinite resource gathering loops.

Short description 
Dadaocheng is a family game with a focus on manipulating resource discs in a central area. Players take on roles of foreign traders in late-nineteenth-century to early-twentieth-century Dadaocheng, Taiwan. Through swapping and/or flipping resource discs in the central area, players obtain resources and either trade these resources to the rest of the world, or spend these resources to buy different buildings within the city of Dadaocheng. The objective of each player is to become the most prestigious trader of Dadaocheng.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Interesting mechanic using the 4 x 4 grid to put together sets of resources that grant you immediate gratification and will grant you and/or opponents potential future gratification. This can be quite the mindbender trying to optimize and see the bigger picture as you continue to gain resources for each set of 3 or 4 of a kind even after flipping tiles so there can be quite a chain developed depending on the tile set up. Seems like two main paths to victory between building mansions and building ships. Not certain a combo pack works well or not. 

AP was an issue in my first game.

全体の得点バランスがイマイチかな？ゲームはパズルチックでプレイヤー間の駆け引きはほとんど無いもののおもしろい。

RATING: 7.75
Original way to get your cubes/resource: turning over or swapping round tiles, that are located in a 4x4 grid. When you score 3 or 4 in a row, you get cubes. After resolving the row, it is flipped over, possibly starting a chain reaction of 3 and 4 in a rows. Cubes can be invested in points cards or in technologies. Smart game that needs a larger exposure to the European and Northamercian markets.

Gioco molto interessante, semplice nelle regole ma che richiede molta attenzione, strategicamente mi piace molto ma trovo che il gioco possa soffrire di troppe paralisi d'analisi per le infinite possibilità da valutare nel fare la propria scelta, proporrei di giocarlo con una clessidra per giocatore. Graficamente il gioco risulta altrettanto interessante. Ottima scoperta.

Perhaps unlucky in that the central 'disk-flip' mechanic came along at the same time as Clacks, which uses it in a much more mechanically natural way. But Dadaocheng isn't without its other flaws: mostly the wobbly 'season' cards and the way in which they manage to be implemented thematically and completely unthematically at the same time. What's the point in putting the years on them if you're then going to shuffle the deck?

[i]This is just not my kind of game. It is basically a spacial puzzle in which you are moving and or flipping discs to get goods. That is the most interesting part although I really didn't enjoy it, way too AP inducing. After there there are about 5 buildings you can buy and some ships. Think Machi Koro with only a handful of buildings. There is absolutely no progression in this game, nothing changes as future rounds are played. It was supposed to be 8 or 9 rounds, we played 4 and it took almost 90 agonizing minutes. Not a game I would ever want to play again.[/i]

I had pretty high hopes for this one and I still do. It is a pretty simple abstract game. We played incorrectly so I can't really say more than I want to play again. After my second play it went better and I enjoy it. Far too long for what it is. Do not play with 4p just takes forever.

Very nice components with super thick cardboard discs. I really like the chip flipping mechanism. Not sure about the replayability of this game as there are really only two paths to victory and one is slightly stronger than the others.

Really happy to finally own this game! Its central puzzle mechanic is a breath of fresh air in the crowded resource gathering genre, and its looks are just as unique (the artwork is really nice). Due to its randomness (the gambling aspect) and the very light purchasing options it is more of a family game than it is a gamers' game, but that only rounds off a game that my girlfriend enjoys too.

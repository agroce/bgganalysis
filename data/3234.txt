Probably the most meh'iest game for a long time. Mechanically works like a German boardgame but lacks that something. It just boils down to setting up your position for the next rounds or capitalising it now. A game of timing your actions, I would say.

The biggest problem is that the actions available always come in the same predetermined order. For some reason it felt dull to know what will happen in the upcoming rounds. Of course it is hard to anticipate every single move other players will take, but there are not too many surprises.

Good aspects of the game are its relatively short playing time, and the blind bidding phase which offers some (and the only) agonizing decisions once a round.

Pretty straight-forward Euro.  Nice, short timeline.  Some real turn angst, as you only get 10 actions in the game.  Not my favorite bidding game, but some neat ideas.

A nicely thematic game of Chinese traders wandering from boat to boat, picking up goods, loading crates and rewarding a hold full of your cargo.  There is the appearance of different paths to victory, but you quickly learn that crates on boats and the special cards that grant you extra supplies are the way to go. The various bonus cards for crates on boats offer decent points, but are quite difficult to bring off, particularly with three opponents stealing the actions you need.  The blind bidding with four types of goods works quite well, though the loss of cards even when you lose a bid is cruel.  Dschunke plays at a brisk pace and keeps its players engaged.

Except for some flimsy currency, the production of Dschunke is up to Queen's best standards.  I find the artwork, in bold poster paint colours, quite pleasing.

A clean and quick playing game that is heavy on blind bidding.  This mechanic may not appeal to all, but the game play is solid and strategic enough that a single round of bad blind bids will not determine who losses (or wins).  Additionally, the bids are only 1 of 2 primary scoring methods.  The heart of the game is really managing the crates on the ships.  These determine the payout or resources gained and thus drive the game more than the bids.  [GTI Code: TGSL]

I've only played this once as a 3-player but this strikes me as a tightly designed game with beautiful board and bits. Something about it reminds me of Taj Mahal. I think it's the fact that there's so much going on at the same time (money, commodities in boats, commodity cards for bidding, special card piles, scores, role selection). But it seems a little more cohesive in Dschunke. This game will definitely reward effective long-term planners and card counters.

Nem értem, hogy miért van ez a játék ennyire elfeledve, szerintem nagyon szórakoztató! Egy könnyed pörgős játékról van szó, melynek csúcspontjai a vaklicitek. Hatalmas pofára esések nélkül nehéz megúszni, de ami ebben a műfajban szokatlan kicsit, hogy akár tutira is lehet menni, mivel korlátozott számú licitlap tartozik minden áruhoz.
Még egyszer mondom, nekem szuper élményt nyújtott a játék, pedig még csak nem is hallottam róla korábban. Mindenkinek ajánlom, aki szereti a könnyed, jól megkomponált és ötletes darabokat...

My gaming group didn't like Dschunke so its future is not clear. I liked it but less than I expected. Why? I found this game impossible to plan ahead, I take one special card in the early turns that would give me 8 yuan at the end of the game, and I was unable to get it although I was all the rest of the game trying to achieve that goal.

The game was fun but maybe too chaotic. Some turns, specially when you play in last position, you didn't have absolutely nothing to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not great, but not bad.  Lots of blind bidding/guessing.  I usually don't mind that, but most Dshunke auctions are for automatic VPs... which means that you cannot try to analyze which auction lot will be best for other players (so you guess).  Much of the game involves mental book-keeping of which kinds of bidding cards opponents have taken (ex. orange vs. purple money).   Fortunately this mechanic is combined with other elements to make the game a bit more strategic.

Juego de mayorías que incluye fase de subastas. Cada jugador es un comerciante en un mercado de oriente. Hay cinco barcos que dan acceso a cuatro tipos de mercancías. En cada turno, los tokens de acción se van desplazando, con lo que van cambiando las opciones disponibles. LAs subastas se hacen con mercancías y el que más tenga de cada tipo de mercancía se lleva lo que marque el mercado en ese momento (cambia cada turno). Como novedad, TODOS los jugadores pierden las mercancías apostadas. 
Tiene bastante puteo y puede parecer algo caótico al principio (dificil de planera), pero poco a poco se pueden ir haciendo cosas. Me he quedado con ganas de volverlo a jugar. Está muy entretenido. Alto nivel de puteo.

One play. I like this game o.k. Getting money is too easy, and seems to result in a potential run away leader if he picks the actions before others can. Also, certain cards drawn early seem to give too much of an advantage. Will try again some time to see if play is different.

For a Michael Schacht game, this is not too terrible.

Played once as a 3 player game which seemed unbalanced. Will replay as a 4 player game.

Lots of luck. The scoring card draw is HUGE. It can totally throw a game.

The players who get "draw extra resource" cards early in the game, have a very unbalanced advantage.

Updated Jan 1, 2017 after 9 years:
Played a second time after one play nearly a decade earlier. It's "ok" for a medium level game. It is very much a mancala game. A bit shorter would be nice. And equal rounds scaled for the number of players is essential. Instead of 10 rounds, play 9 rounds for 3 player games; and play 8 rounds for 4 player games.

RATING: 7
Wouldn't play it all that often, but a fairly solid game nonetheless.  We played with 3 players, where the rock-paper-scissors factor was much greater than you'd get with 4.   Seems to me that the special cards would gain power significantly (too much?) in a 4 player game. Not a pile of dschunke.

A nice, light little game in a huge box. I normally hate blind bidding but it works pretty well here. Unfortunately, we can never seem to get to the table, primarily because of the player restriction. With that said, I'm sad to see this leave our collection, as I like the bluffing aspect, the theme is neat, and the components and art all look great. Why does Queen Games need to use such stupidly big boxes!?!

Fun little game that isn't too taxing on the brain.  In the auction phase, this game has crazy blind bidding.  Not only do you have to guess how much your opponents will bid, but you also have to guess what they're going to bid on!  It's kind of like rock, paper, scissors meets blind bidding.  I'm usually not fond of games where you have to outguess your opponents, but this one has enough other stuff going on to make it doable for me.

This one is good.  I like the fact that I can plan 3 turns ahead, and predict what is going to happen.  Planning games are my thing.  Blind bidding doesn't bother me either.  The card aspect is a little distressing, but it is close to Princes of Florence in being able to downplay the random factor.  It can get a bit repetitive. I will have to see what a 4 player game offers, but chances are my liking of this game will increase.

RATING: 4
For me, fell flat when I played it numerous times with 3 and 4 players. First the problem was about figuring out what good special cards were: that was soon solved. Multiple '1 beliebige Warenkarte'-n early in the game are devastating: you have a noticable edge over the rest which is hard to counter. You simply have more cards to 'poker' with, and that increases your chances of winning points. Then we saw a run on decks you knew contained many of these cards, and after that the game lost its appeal, because winning was essentially striking it lucky with these cards. Then we tried a variant which had the special cards lying open. That certainly improved the game to the point runaway leaders became shuffleaway leaders. We also implemented the variant where bidding is done consecutively instead of simultaneously. That also helped in making the game more interesting. I recommened you implement these changes even if you have no problems with the rules as written. 

Unfortunately, it simply didn't do much to improve my [i]liking[/i] of it all. Dschunke is a weird hodgepodge of all sorts of elements which cooperate well from a technical point of view, but not from a player's point of view: limited action choice, bluffing and special cards...? It is tricky to explain this game, there is little sense of achievement or direction... No. Definitely a try before you buy.

The best option for a given player is fairly obvious each turn.  This minimizes analysis paralysis, but makes the decision-making aspect of the game limited.  The skill of play in this game comes in the bidding.  Misbid and you will lose this game handily.  I like the production quality of the game except for two things.  First off, Queen game boxes are way too big--I probably won't purchase any of their games because of this.  Second, the money notes in the game are cheap paper quality compared to the nice components that make up the rest of the game.

Préparation
Le plateau de jeu représente cinq jonques, quatre d’entre elles transportent une marchandise spécifique (sel, poisson…) repérable à la couleur, la cinquième les transportent toutes.
En haut du tableau se trouve deux pistes qui concernent les aides.
Chaque joueur reçoit :
- 20 palettes à sa couleur
- 2 cartes réapprovisionnement à sa couleur, placées face visible devant soi
- Après avoir sélectionné et mélangé 8 cartes (6 à 3 joueurs) de chaque marchandise, on en distribue 8 face cachées à chaque joueur.
Les 10 tuiles marché sont mélangées et placées en pile sur l’emplacement du marché en haut à gauche.
Les cartes spéciales sont mélangées et divisée en 4 tas à peu prés équivalents et posés faces cachées sur les quatre emplacements à droite. Elles sont de deux types, celles qui donnent un avantage au cours de la partie de manière permanente ou pas et celles qui donnent un bonus en fin de partie si le joueur arrive à remplir la condition imposée.
A trois joueurs, la piste supérieure n’est pas utilisée.
Pour la configuration de départ des marchands et des palettes sont placés sur les jonques :
- marchand vert sur la jonque légume, violette
- marchand violet sur la jonque poisson, marron
- marchand jaune sur la jonque tout type de marchandise, grise
Palettes (à 3 joueurs) :
- jonque épice, orange : une rouge et une verte
- jonque légume, violette : une bleue et une verte
- jonque poisson, marron : une rouge, une bleue et une verte
- jonque sel, blanche : une rouge et une bleue
- jonque tout type de marchandise, grise : une rouge, une bleue et une verte
Palettes (à 4 joueurs) :
- jonque épice, orange : une rouge et une jaune
- jonque légume, violette : une bleue et une verte
- jonque poisson, marron : une rouge, une jaune et une verte
- jonque sel, blanche : une jaune et une bleue
- jonque tout type de marchandise, grise : une rouge, une bleue et une verte

Le jeu
Il se déroule sur 10 tours (les 10 tuiles du marché) à l’issue desquels il y a un décompte.
Un tour se décompose en 6 phases :
1- Marché et événement
La première tuile marché est retournée, elle indique le cours des marchandises valable pour le tour.
Si un aide se trouve sur une case S : Chaque joueur en commençant par le premier prend un des tas de cartes spéciales. Puis chacun sélectionne une des cartes et repose son tas sur son emplacement.
Si un aide se trouve sur une case Y : chaque joueur annonce publiquement sa fortune.
2- Action
Chaque joueur doit effectuer une action. Une action est toujours liée à un personnage et à un lieu, c’est à dire une jonque. Il y a 5 jetons personnages : 3 marchands sur les jonques et 2 aides sur le quai ( 1 seul aide à 3 joueurs). Si un marchand est sélectionné l’action est effectuée sur la jonque où il se trouve. Si c’est un aide qui est sélectionné le joueur choisit d’effectuer son action dans un des deux bateaux où il n’y a pas de marchand et où aucune action n'a déjà été faite. Une fois qu’un personnage est utilisé il n’est plus disponible pour le reste du tour. Il y a trois types d’action possibles:
A) Charger des palettes : Charger 2 palettes sur la jonque, celles ci sont rangées par étages successifs de 3 palettes. A chaque nouvel étage les palettes sont posées selon la perpendiculaire et recouvrent l’étage précédent ( un peu comme à Jenga).
B) Recevoir des revenus : gagner 1 yuan pour chacune de ses caisses visibles sur la jonque avec un minimum de 3 yuans si le joueur à moins de 4 caisses visibles.
C) Prendre des cartes marchandises : le joueur prend autant de cartes marchandise sur la jonque pour chacune de ses caisses visibles. Si c’est sur la jonque grise, il a le choix de choisir son type de carte marchandise.
Note : s’il n’y a plus de cartes marchandise sur la jonque où il doit les piocher, le joueur peut en prendre sur une autre jonque.
3- Réapprovisionnement
Chaque joueur en respectant le sens horaire peut prendre autant de cartes marchandises sur une ou plusieurs jonques qu’il a de cartes approvisionnement.
4- Marchandage
Chaque joueur choisit secrètement une série de 0 à N cartes d’une même marchandise, puis tout le monde révèle en même temps ses cartes. Pour chaque marchandise celui qui a présenté la plus longue série gagne une somme fixe en fonction des cours de la tuile marché où gagne la possibilité de choisir une carte spéciale dans un des quatre tas au choix.
Si une ou plusieurs marchandises n’ont pas été choisies par les joueurs, il y a une nouvelle enchère jusqu’à ce que tous les types de marchandises aient été vendu où que tous les joueurs mise 0 carte.
Toutes les cartes marchandises jouées rejoignent leur jonque respective.
5- Déplacement
Les trois marchands passent sur le prochain bateau en sens horaire, les aides passent sur la prochaine case. Le nouveau premier joueur est déterminé par le sens horaire.

Fin de la partie
A la fin du dixième tour le score des joueurs est obtenu en additionnant :
- leur richesse
- les bonus éventuels liés aux cartes spéciales
- le bonus final : un joueur reçoit 4 yuans pour chaque jonque où une de ses caisses est visible. S’il a au moins une caisse visible sur les 5 jonques le bonus est de 25 yuans.

Mon opinion
Michael Schacht a réussi avec Dschunke ce qu’il avait loupé avec Kardinal & König : faire un jeu de plateau pour le grand public. Autant son aîné m’a paru austère autant celui ci se caractérise par sa convivialité. Il y a plusieurs stratégies et tout le monde à quelque chose à faire si bien que l’ennui ne guette personne. C’est le haut du pavé du jeu malin ouvert à un public non spécialiste: il y a des billets de banque, des coups fourrés avec l’agencement des palettes, des enchères à poing fermé au moment du marchandage. Tout pour réussir une soirée amicale et décontractée. Dschunke n'est pas réellement compliqué, mais le public familial (enfants, non- joueurs) peut etre déconcerté devant les multiples tactiques envisageables.Il y a peu d'informations cachées et beaucoup de choses peuvent être déduites en observant les choix de ses adversaires.
Le jeu est réussi sur le plan de l’interactivité, il faut le jouer avec un bon public et sans se prendre la tête. Il a tout de meme quelques menus défauts:
- Le jeu se joue en 10 tours, donc chaque joueur ne va pas commencer le même nombre de fois et cela peut compter car le choix des actions à la phase 2 se fait joueur après joueur et que les égalités favorisent les premiers dans l'ordre du tour.
- Je suis toujours réticent devant les cartes spéciales : la bonne capacité qui vous arrive au bon moment et c’est le désastre pour vos adversaires. Il y a par exemple une carte spéciale unique qui permet de remporter la phase de marchandage en cas d’égalité. Elle est très intéressante mais il est possible de l’avoir que si l’on pioche le bon tas de cartes spéciales en début de partie, soit une chance sur quatre.
- Si vous avez le malheur de jouer avec quelqu’un à la mémoire d’éléphant qui retient les cartes marchandises que les joueurs ont en main vous connaissez déjà le vainqueur.
Dschunke n’est donc pas un jeu hautement stratégique mais c’est un excellent produit d’initiation qui aurait mérité le Spiel des Jahres 2002.

One of the more underrated game (here on the BGG) I've played.  You are loading crates onto junks, then selecting actions that reward you based on how many crates you have on that junk. Similar to Puerto Rico (selecting roles), but with some cool twists...like blind bidding.  In fact, I'd say if you like blind-bidding/bluffing this game is for you.   This one *really* needs to be reprinted in English.  Downgrading from a 9 to an 8 because I've just found so many better games such that I now will "probably suggest it and would never turn it down"....instead of "always wanting to play".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Interesting game where players take actions available on junks floating in a harbour.  The actions are load goods, which affect the other two actions, draw cards and draw income.  Cards are used in bidding for further income.  Pleasant game where you must plan ahead.  Nice, quick playing time too.

RATING: 4
[Schacht] Probably one of the greatest games with blind-bidding ever made, but that's like saying Missing you Now is probably Michael Bolton's greatest song. 
 
There is an early version of the role-selection thing from Verater going on here, and a cool majorities-thing with stacking goods on the boats. All of this would create a clever little manipulation game. But the whole thing become a trainwreck with an insane blind-bidding, pay-whether-you-win-or-lose and try-to-guess what-suit-the-other-guys-are-bidding going on. This wild crap-shoot mechanism dashes your hopes at creating any form of strategy at all... 
 
Had some great potential though, but thrusting the inane bidding system wrecked this promising design.

Akciósan jutottam hozzá vagy 5 éve. Sokáig állt a polcon, míg lefordítottuk. De aztán gyorsan kedvenc lett. Nem hosszú játék, jól tervezhető, előre akár több lépést, a kártyahúzás ugyan ad szerencsét hozzá: de mivel nem 1 lapot húzunk, hanem egy pakliból választunk ez egész minimálisra szorítható. Az első Michael Schacht játékom volt, egyből kedvencemmé is avanzsált a szerző.
Update: a beszerzése és az első játék óta sok év telt el. Még mindig kedvenc és klasszikus. Elég jól tervezhető, mégsem durva gémerjáték, ugyanakkor kellő konfrontáció is, és jól kitalált szerepek.  Lassan 3 éve /2010 óta/ lebegtetik az újra kiadását, de aztán sose semmi. Idén már úgy hallottam, h áttematizálják London market néven. 
AZ a játék,a minek egyszerűek a szabályai, jól érthető, világos, a család is könnyen  imádja, és gémereknek is nagyon jó.

2016-02-08 : One of the better Michael Schacht games - the chaos is kept well under control and you can actually form a long-term plan and execute it. Only negative is that even for the short game that it is, it felt just a couple of turns too long. I'm pretty sure that if I had played this one 10 years ago I'd have rated it an 8, but compared to more modern games it doesn't hold up that well.

The game works as a whole but there's no engaging theme, or mechanics that draws your attention. Typical Michael Schacht game, you could say. It's one of those process-driven, "Do A, then B, then C" kind of games. Passable but not top-notch. If I had known it was a Schacht game, I wouldn't have played.

Lots of interesting ideas here, but I just didn't enjoy it much. I think Dschunke is an original game, I liked the apprentice track along the top. But I just couldn't get a virtuous sequence going, and felt constantly thwarted by actions outside my control. It wasn't the game or experience I was expecting, having played Rat Hot already. I may give it another go sometime, but not soon. Being able to change the order of the action discs might have made it better for me.

Not really my cup of tea.  Some fun & challenge, but the more I examine it the more I feel it's lacking just enough control to feel unfair.  It's also annoying that in the 4 player game (my only 2 plays and what appears most recommended) the first 2 players get to go 1st an extra time.

Very good game with original yet simple mechanics that makes it possible to think ahead a couple of moves without frying your brain. Some action cards are unbalanced (what is the point of &quot;moving a set of boxes&quot; when you can &quot;place a new set of boxes&quot;?) Fortunately, the card drawing mechanism makes up for this.

Dschunke is a blind bidding game. That in itself is bad enough but it is also a blind bidding game where even the losers of an auction lose their bids. Most surprisingly, however, that is not so much of a problem here primarily because the auctions aren't actually all that important since you can actually score better by playing the board instead.

What instead does turn out to be a problem is the fixed turn order and, coupled with that, the availability or non-availability of certain actions depending on your place in said turn order. It is bloody annoying if you can see the trouble heading your way three turns ahead but there is simply nothing at all you can do about it.

It's dry, it's by Michael Schacht and it has a strange artwork. Three reasons why I shouldn't have played it. Luckily I didn't know all that and played Dschunke. A surprisingly good game.

The blind bidding for the points is my favorite part of this game. Plays OK with 3, but best with 4. Suggest using chips instead of the horrible money that is supplied in the game. Contrary to popular belief, card counters won't always win this game. The blind bidding portion is also about bluffing. Just because you know how many cards I have, doesn't mean that you will get any given commodity for the best price. It's always great to see someone bid 9 sugar for an item when I only bid 1. You will quickly run out of cards if you constantly pay highest prices for items. This game is about bluffing and getting the best price...I really like this game!

There's definitely some interesting stuff happening, but the question is whether one really has much room to maneuver within the game's structure.  I think the players are too hampered by the tidal patterns of the game's turn progression.

Pleasantly surprised with this, as it didn't seem very exciting from the rules.  There's some nice planning involved as you can see what actions will be available to you in each round, there's also some gentle neighbour-beating in the taking of actions that you know they would want on their turns, thereby blocking them.

Very interesting and fun game. Card counters do have a slight advantage but bluffing is a key aspect of this game. My only questions about this game is that since it's a 3-4 player game, why not make it 12 rounds instead of ten? This way, things would even out.

RATING: 6
There's a big problem here.  While you are doing blind auctions, you are using resource cards of which there are only 4 types.  The cards are selected openly which favors those players who are able to track and remember those kinds of things.  I can't, but my very good friend can.  Kind of ruins it for me.

These comments are from doing a solo three player walk through of half the game. The game is a resource collecting game in which the four different resources are used to bid blindly. If you have a great memory of the resources other players have collected this would seem to offer some advantage. Also after the start player the number of good options left for other players seems somewhat limited. There are some special cards obtained through bidding or at two points in the game. Early on it would seem important to select cards that give end game bonuses, but then selecting other cards later in the game won't have much impact. I imagine when this game came out it was somewhat more interesting than many that were available, but I don't think it is competitive with more recent designs.

Based on my one playing, it seems as though the choices presented to the players are unbalanced in value.  Taking money, I think, is almost always better than cards - and it seems as though cards are intended to be central to the game.

Additionally, playing cards involves blind bidding (with all bids lost, as I recall) making for an often frustrating degree of luck.

I'll consider the first game a learning game.  I now realize how important it is to look ahead and watch what will happen in subsequent rounds and make plans accordingly.  There's a good mixture of mechanisms at play, and is surprisingly thematic for a Michael Schacht game, not as dry as one would expect.  The German is not a problem at all.  Gameplay is fairly straightforward, but I did horribly.  I was consistently outbid and lost quite a few cards in the bartering phase.  I can't wait to try this again - the rating could potentially go up.

Its a game similar to For Sale. Players use their actions to get Goods cards, and these cards are then used to bid for points. A fairly simple system and quick to play. Unfortunately, there's not too much replayability in this one. Its just a bit bland for my tastes.

While there are pieces of this game that I like, there is something about the game that also rubs me the wrong way.  Not really sure if I can put my finger on it though!  It may well be that that it was just the way that order of the masters ended up being in the one game I've played - I don't believe I would ever want to see the order of the loading master immediately followed by the selling master as this makes it practically impossible to counter a potentially powerful scoring play over two turns.  I do want to give this one another try - there's enough there to make it interesting and it is one of those games where you can see your doom approaching if you don't look ahead and plan accordingly.

I struggle with this one. I so want to like it more. A bidding and auction game that in some cases makes them seem not as important, as entertaining as they might be. Something with the turns taken also seems imbalanced with three and four.

For 10%u20AC it was a good investment!

Wow, what a terrible "something" wrapped inside what looks like a game. The blind bidding is almost all luck, it would make much sense and would be a lot less irritating if you didn't loose your cards if you didn't win the auction. The action selection mechanism is neat, but it feels like an unfinished idea and didn't grab me very much (but at the same time it really felt like it was just one twist away from being awesomely great). As it is, this game is only about drawing cards, and then playing them and hope to get some points by having played more cards than your opponent. None of my decisions felt especially significant or fun.

A good blind-bidding game with some interesting tactics & cool system.  I especially like the plank laying mechanic used to control boats.  The bidding can be frustrating since you lose all of your money whether you win or not.  Players have a pretty good idea of what their opponents have to bid with but that almost makes it trickier since you're trying to win without spending too much & your opponenets can be difficult to read.  Just have fun & don't take this game too seriously.

After 1 game, you've pretty much learnt everything you need to know to play this game well. It doesn't say much for replayability. But it's a decent tactical romp, with a bit of forward planning where you can assess the likelihood of your preferred actions being available by the time your turn comes around. However, avoid like the plague if you dislike games where you lose all your cards in the important blind bluff section regardless of win or loss. That can kill ya.

Quite a lot of information is closed in this game. In two rounds, players have to recite their current amount of gold. Very efficient in a game with hidden points.

One particular thing worth mentioning: this game took one hour to play, but the gameplay was fast and rich, so it really felt as if the game was shorter! An admirable quality in a game.

A good game with the feel of Taj Mahal. A variety of strategies can be used while players compete for the most money (points). There are two drawbacks (and they can be significant).  First, the 'spacial cards' can completely alter the game; the right card at the right time can move a player from the back of the pack to winning. Second, all parts of the game are 'serious' until you reach the blind bidding.  It is difficult to acept blind bidding in a serious strategy game; it is simply too much guessing/bluffing.  Blind bidding belongs in games like Fist of Dragonstones, not Taj Mahal.  That said, there is a lot more depth to this game than Industria and more interaction.  This is the better of the two games.

Unlike current worker placement games, this one is particularly nasty. It's frequently disastrous when an opponent takes the action you want.

A nice, quick game by a solid designer. I've never had a problem with blind bidding, so that's a fine aspect for me. The game looks good too.

Too early to rate this really but I just thought this is a solid Euro with nice bits. This may deserve a 7 but as i can't remember any specifics, and don't feel any burning desire to play again, a 6 seems right. One of the guys I game with really liked it though so YMMV.

Shame this Schacht middle weight was picked up by an english publisher. It offers several unique twists on area control and blind bidding, tightly woven into a tense affair.

Players are trying to activate merchants or trainees to either collect goods, money or lay down crate strips (area control). The blind bidding auction allows players to trade money for goods or special cards (values determined by a San Juan style market). After 10 rounds, the person with the most money wins.

Lots of tough decisions (even with only ONE player action). Watch out for those special cards and try to pick up the 25 point bonus at the end of the game.

I don't like blind bidding, and if you don't win the bid, you still lose your money.

A game with many different scoring mechanisms and as such, allows myriad means of achieving victory. The cards add an element of uncertainly while the crates ensure that concentrating on one aspect can be fatal to chances of victory.

Pffffffffttttttttthhhhhhhh!!!!!

This game suffers from the same problem that rots Kramer's Maharaja.  Create a deep fun game, that requires intesive planning and calculation and throw it all in a chaotic meat grinder.

See what happens.

Most of the time you are going to get what you want, but if you don't the penalty is too steep for the reward.  Blind bidding where you lose your goods generally is annoying, but here it is the least of the offenses.

The offense is that the auctions just aren't all that important compared to how much you can score by taking the scoring action. 

If you were somehow to win all of the points from the auctions, you make 7 yuan, if you invest your energy on building up the boats, then you just score it without wasting time on the auctions (and perhaps winning auctions by default).  Outside of winning the special cards the auctions just felt as though they were the least important part of the game. 

Also, the fact that the card draw piles turn the end game into a memory game for the important victory cards makes this even more annoying.

In a three player game the third player goes last for the first and the last rounds which really is a rip off.  Especially as the last round has two pay offs available (you can bet that the third player will not see them). 

This game walks the fine line between brilliance and stupidity.  A shame it tripped.

Interesting game, based on a couple of single-three person plays.  Components are very nice and brightly colored, including the bright red starting piece, the 'junk' (Dschunke in German).  The stacking ships cargo boxes is an interesting means of determining how much of an action a player gets to take with their role choice.  I also liked the blind-bidding "Warenpoker" round (actually, I just liked to shout "Warenpoker!")

Dschunke is one of my go-to games when I only have three players.  It plays out fairly quickly, and gives a pretty good balance for three.

I enjoy the tight competition here and the fast pace.  Some turns you can score big with an obvious move while others really make you think.  I also like how everyone has to reveal their money holdings at certain points in the game.  I felt like playing again immediately after my first game ended, always a good sign.

Primary rating after a 2 player game - played with a variant. I have to try it with more players to rate it accurately. Generaly I liked the game. It's very well designed with some luck and chaos mixed. It could be an easy seven.

I liked it better with 2 than with 4 players although I'm not sure we've played it with the right rules. The lack of control over everything seemed to be the most important handicap of the game.

This game is Junk. [snicker] Not a fan of blind-bidding games where the losers waste their bid like "Fist of Dragonstones". But this game has other things to do besides that bidding so it gets some more points.

Great game for three or four.  The strong blind bidding/bluff element may put some off, but I like the guesswork.  The special cards add necessary variety, and the end scoring gives players another thing to think about at the close.  The board is gorgeous and the game has the largest start player marker I own, with a special insert to boot.

Alas, I have kept this game on the shelves far too long before my initial play and this game has aged along with my taste for certain game designs. It is likely that if I played the game 10 years ago right after publication, I would enjoy it more. However, certain elements of the game now rub me the wrong way. To be fair, Schacht designs are a hit or miss for me. I adore China/Web of Power and I rank it a "9" and I absolutely love Coloretto and its spinoff Zooloretto. Not so much with Africana or California. Dschunke feels more like a game in development as there are several facets of game design that feels unpolished. First, 10 rounds split among 4 players means the first player get first choice selection in 3 of the 10 rounds. This is a sizable advantage. Next, having special events to declare Yuan or to select special cards feels tagged on and a last minute addition to correct for omissions in game design. What is the point of hidden information only to be periodically revealed? I fail to see the point. Having everyone acquiring special cards at periodic rounds also feel as a balancing mechanism. Finally, the blind bidding mechanism where you lose your bidding hand regardless of the outcome is a mechanic that many either love or shun. I tend to shy away from this mechanism but this is more a personal preference than a critique of the game.

It will be interesting to see if the reincarnation of the game in the form of London Markets will achieve commercial success as most of the rules remain unaltered. However for me, this game has aged out of my personal tastes.

Like Web of Power, it is a specimen of conciseness and clarity despite the confusing rule translations out there.
The game is greatly benefited for non-german players by the paste-ups available. With some familarity with the rules and these, we have been able to play it in half an hour. This game is meant to be played quickly and casually.

You've got to like blind biddding games, which means you spend a lot of time outguessing your opponent, but that mechanic doesn't overstay its welcome in this relatively quick game.

Played twice (with 3 and 4 players). While there are things to like in this game, I don't think I enjoy the main phase (blind-bidding) because it just can be too "random". The fact that everyone loses all the cards they bet does not help. I am sure it is possible to plan ahead and count the cards to do better, but that seems to be too much work for the effort.

7 after 1 play

The mechanics of moving the possible actions around the junks and placement of goods on the junks are engaging. The bidding mechanic where losing player loses his/her bid is the major minus. Component quality is good, though it does have paper money. Rather easy to teach and reasonably short playtime.

RATING: 5
I'd score this game higher if it weren't for the ludicrously unreadable text on the worker placement location tiles.  With typically each tile having 50-100 words in a tiny semi-opaque font on a busy, colorful background, on your turn you'd need to pick up and carefully read all of them.

The game starts with 4 tiles on display and on your turn you place 1 of your 3 workers.  With 3 turns and with all workers placed the round ends.  At the end of the round 1 location tile is retained and another random 4 added to the display, so the number of tiles steadily increases.  Which means the downtime steadily increases too, as it can take quite a while to read and digest all of the tiles' contents.

This made the whole process very tiresome and took most of the fun out of the experience, despite the puzzle of arranging your books on shelves being quite engaging.

If the tiles had decent, large icons I would consider buying and playing the game again.  As they don't, I won't.

Only played once but rating because I'm unlikely to agree to play it again. The artwork of this game is beautiful and it's easy enough to learn, but I just didn't enjoy it. It felt very luck-heavy, maybe in part because we got unlucky with what cards came out, but regardless of that, the luck element is very intense. I didn't feel like I was making terribly interesting choices and I normally adore games of this sort. The theme was also appealing to me, but the game itself just felt like a luck game pretending to be a strategy game. The tiny location text didn't help, of course, as it slowed down the game considerably to have to read cards for people. And because the graphic design is so busy, people managed to forget some locations existed. 

I just came away not being terribly impressed, despite having really thought I'd like this game going in. It also wound up not really feeling very unique to me, which is a shame given how unique the theme is and the lovely artwork. It just felt like symbol set-collection, where each decision could be made through a simple point calculation, besides the many gambles, which may either pay off ridiculously well or not at all. The high-reward gambling made me feel like I had no control over the outcome of the game. As short as the game was, we had two players clearly running away with the win, and then one of them ended up winning the game due to a few lucky guesses in the gambling locations. Overall, I might be compelled to play it again just because it's so short if anyone truly wants to, but I can't see myself ever going out of my way to play it.

Fun loving theme with a zillion (well, 510) cards! The worker placement spots are very good - although the text is *very* difficult to see - even up close! Iconography would have helped? Or larger text at the very least. The asymmetry of abilities and contention over actions make for a fun game. It feels a bit like push-your-luck as well when building your shelves - you can work yourself into a corner if not careful. The combo of scoring options plus ever increasing options can make an AP prone player take forever! That's the greatest weakness here. But still - I like it!

:thumbsup: The different specialists change the course of each play, and are accompanied by adorable meeples.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]Only about half of the content is compatible with the solo mode, reducing a lot of the reusability.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]Although the theme shines in some respects, the majority of the mechanics focus on fairly basic set collection.

:thumbsdown: There isn't much of a challenge, as a lot of each play comes down to luck and minimal strategic thinking.
:thumbsdown: The scoring phase adds on a lot of time and reduces the enjoyment of the overall experience markedly.

Beautiful game, easy to explain and play. The only downside is that it feels a bit unbalanced. The prefered books are overpowered and there is a huge difference in the usefullness of the characters. And why is there no extra penalty for having the most banned books? Now, with only -1 per banned book, there is nothing really holding you back if the others books are decent.

All in all, it feels like it should have been playtested more. Has potential with some tweeks regarding the rules.

Nice theme wherein you are acquiring and shelving books in your personal library, fun and quirky worker placement mechanics that vary from game to game, dependent upon which placement boards (of many) arise in you game from the stack, and asymmetric players powers for one of your three workers.   

All in all a worthy design, clearly a labor of love, that should please fans of worker placement games unless, I suppose, they are unwilling to embrace a clever design that greatly varies its worker placement possibilities from game to game.

In  the two first plays, this one established that it is indeed a very good game. I beleive this one has staying power and will get better with age. Production is great for what is here, but the gameplay is so solid and engaging that is what gives it its legs. I think the biggest challenege is not fully understanding the depth of game you may be about to play with this one, and some may then skip that first play altogether, do yourself a favor and do NOT skip this one, it is worth it. The different ways you can build to success, the public and private goals, the strategy within the set collection is very well done and quite refreshing actually. It is fun AND had legs to stand, this one wound up being my most conspired game to try and play after I got it in a long time, that is saying LOADS for me, one who is now satisfied with excellent single player experiences for this very reason, this one needs at least TWO and you WANT that other player (at least) cannot say enough about it here, go play it.

One of the big disappointments of 2017 for me. As a writer and book-lover, I REALLY wanted to love this game, but in the end found it annoying. Many have commented on the small text, but the bigger annoyance for me was the constantly changing action locations. That mechanic works much better in Harvest, where you only get a few new locations per round. And it works in Fabled Fruit, because that's all that's going on. But in this game, the designer has tried to cobble too much together and it feels a bit like an unwieldy mess. The art and humour are wonderful, and I do love the book-stacking, tableau-building element, but could have done without the rest of it. I'd certainly be open to playing this again, but don't need to buy it. The writer in me is perfectly happy already with Paperback.

Was ok. VERY fiddly and you need to know and evaluate the locations. The point scoring seems off - winning strategy is to just go for your own type of book at the expense of everything else. Looked nice, but writing was hard to read on location tiles. Very fun and whimsical book titles. Interesting game for book lovers.

Some special assistant cards are better than others. It is possible for the game to go very short, and for one player to rush to the end the game while the rest are stuck trying to find ways to shelve cards. When an action duplicating or chaining special assistant is out, and they go first, it can be demoralizing to the rest of the players.

Will be researching and implementing house rules.

RATING: N/A
Ex Libris makes the dullest of themes (organizing books in a library) fun as a worker placement game where players are managing a hand of cards representing books (shelves of books) in a library. There is set collection for the type of books and the books must be organized alphabetically in 3 rows with each row being as wide as desired. There are bonuses for types of books collected and "squareness" of the library and so on. Each player selects a different character with a special ability which seems to be, maybe, the biggest trend in new games today. The special abilities weren't bad and the custom, colorful meeples for each character were nice. The worker placement spaces seem interesting and some of them stick around as the game continues.

I played a 3 player game and the worker placement locations didn't work out nearly as well as I expected. I bet it would be more interesting with more players, but can't be sure. I'd play it again, but have no strong interest in making sure that happens.

RATING: 6
Sporadically fun game that can be hampered by variable player powers that seem, at best, uneven in usefulness and excitement and, at worst, unbalanced.  In addition, there are tiles that are useless if out in early rounds.  Add to that the poor graphic design choice of small, white text on all the tiles and it can make the game frustrating to new players.

The artwork is excellent, the special character meeples are charming, and the theme is fantastic.  Unfortunately, games can swing between being fun and being a slog.

RATING: 8
In Ex Libris, you are each collecting books for your fantasy libraries by sending your workers out to various locations. In mechanism terms, this means you are using worker placement to build a tableau of cards, which are books that must be arranged in alphabetical order. 

Everyone has one unique worker with a special ability, and two regular workers. The locations you can send workers will grow throughout the game, and most will come out randomly, so every game is different. Also, the books each have a type, most of which you want and one of which you don't. There are bonuses for having stable shelves and for having the most of a specific category.

I really like the mechanics in this game and the theme is quite endearing when you pair workers like the snowman and the gelatinous cube with the comical fantasy book titles and location names. It may blossom into a higher rank with more plays but so far I'm enjoying it quite a bit already.

Had high hopes for this one with all the hype.  The graphic design is awful, which makes playing the game a pain in the butt.  The game is also probably too short, as it kind of felt like it ended before it got interesting.  I like the way the worker placement spaces rotate in, with one staying around for the rest of the game though.  Wouldn't mind playing again, but probably not something I need to pick up for myself.

I get the feeling this is not rated higher due to the very difficult to read location tiles. I printed out player aids for those and that has helped quite a bit.

I don't have a top ten, but if I did, this would immediately have jumped into it on our first play. It's AMAZING! It hits every spot for me perfectly, from theme,  graphic design, component quality, to implementation. Very clever worker placement with puzzle aspects of arranging your shelf (card) placements. Lots of variety for available locations, and it's random each time what comes out when. The provided score sheet (which is reusable, comes with a wipe off marker) makes figuring out the scoring a cinch. If you enjoy worker placement/puzzle games, like the theme of fantasy and books/libraries, and enjoy puns (every book illustrated on the cards has a hilarious name, all unique!) this is definitely the game for you!

RATING: 4
I wouldn't really want to play this again, but if a group really wanted to play it, I would still play it over playing a 3DS game. Probably. In the end it's a fairly simple set collection and worker placement game. The biggest flaw is the text on art they have on each worker placement spot. Very hard to read. Should have used icons or a combination of text and icons, and they should have made the text bigger and stand out more. One of the players in my game gave up on remembering what spots did what because they got so tired of having to pick up the boards to read it. None of us are that old yet.

I find the theme very fun, and love to organize anyway, so I enjoyed my first time playing this. Unfortunately, I think replayability is limited, because the game does get "samey" pretty quickly. I feel the stability bonus should reward players who build 3 rows more, since it's more challenging to do so. Some powers also seem unbalanced, and we really aren't fans of the "take that" powers and locations, so the game is really limited for us. We'll see how long this lasts, but for now, it's fun enough.

One of my favorite games for sale at Gen Con 2017. This worker placement game is absolutely gorgeous to look at with the colorful artwork and all the clever titles that comprised your library. I love the special players, as always, and I really enjoyed the need to arrange your books in alphabetical order and to have a sturdy base to maximize scoring. The only big flaw is the lack of symbols on the action tiles. There's too much text to read and it is too small. Despite that, it's still a really good game that most people will enjoy.

The book cards create an interesting puzzle that at the same time isn’t brain burning in the least. It’s also very quick, so it doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. There is some customization available to give your game more or less complexity. Overall, I am very happy with this game, and I expect to play it many times.

I played a 2-player game and neither one of us felt any challenge. We both just collected enough book cards, that either minimized the "banned books" symbols or outright discarded them then built shelves. There needs to be a hand limit to force players to shelve the books, that would make it interesting, otherwise there's no reason to do anything until you've gotten 16 good cards to shelf (2-player end-game trigger).  Also there's no way to interact with your opponent, so you can't force them to discard from their hand or to shelve a book before they are ready or to discard cards already shelved. It was rather dull.

This is a really clever tableau building game with a surprising amount of push-your-luck to it.  Y'see, it *looks* like it would primarily be a worker placement game, with the ensuing battle over spots and collection of resources, but it isn't.  Sure, there are places to put workers, but they more or less do variants of the same thing: draw and shelve cards.  They're just not exciting.

Where the challenge comes in is the shelf you are building, and the desire to (i) keep it in alphabetical order, and (ii) maximize/minimize the right sorts of books.  Here's where the PYL comes in: how do you build your shelf?  Do you put an E right next to a B, and write-off the future draws of C and D?  When do you split to another row?  How many rows/columns do you want?  Because you're shooting for a big rectangle too.  

It's really easy to cut yourself out of a large chunk of cards if you're greedy.  What I also liked was how it is possible to mess up someone else's tableau by strategically denying them cards.  This also makes certain abilities that seem negative (e.g. hand your opponent cards for free) not be all that bad, if you're smart about what you offer and pay attention to what they are doing.  This in turn causes certain abilities to change in value over the game: what isn't a good idea in the early rounds becomes much more interesting in the later rounds.

So there's quite a different game in here, all wrapped up in a beautiful and creative theme.

I didn't really care for this game. The worker placement powers that I got dealt didn't really seem to help me. With only 3 players, the others never really took the same actions spots so the green cube was never triggered. The player with the Yeti seemed to get the most use and I wasn't sure if it was due to the third player not understanding that he was boosting our opponent. The act of ordering the books on the shelf was pretty boring as well. Sure there are cute names for all the books but there are pretty simple ways to build out the shelves so they can be expanded. Wouldn't really go out of my way to play this game again.

In the vein of Holmes: Sherlock  & Mycroft, the starter action(s) is/are the same every game, and you add a randomly chosen action board each round. There's a lot more to the scoring in Ex Libris, though.  The bookcase is too easy to set up with two players, so the game works best with more. If you suffer as I do from special abilities overlaod, the good news here is that the game plays well without the special assistants.

Solid game. Almost a filler. 45-60 minutes. In is above average in all segments. Cute theme about collecting books and arranging them in alphabetical order using intuitive worker placement mechanic. Worker locations are constantly shifting and changing from round to round so not two games will be the same, especially with different foci and different variable incentives and different unique assistants with asymmetric player powers.  Special mention deserves flavor of every card which represents one shelf with 1 to 4 books, each with unique, witty titles which are perfect reading material during downtime. Kudos to that. Also erasable scoring board to use at the end of the game. However with all those mechanics and interesting player interaction the game is there around the average. Variability will expire after the game 3. Also not all unique assistants are equally fun. My snowmen did nothing useful during the whole game in which I won nevertheless.

Variable player powers are great; and I like the overall flow of the game and placement of the books. However, there are a couple of issues: the text on the tiles is really hard to read, and there is just too much of it. This is a game that has a lot of rules for the depth of gameplay - I've only played the game twice, but felt like I spent half the time trying to work through what the worker placement spots did. Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't quite "pay off" in subsequent depth.

RATING: 6.5
It's not bad, but not very exciting, either.  The worker placement gameplay is solid even with variable player powers.  The worker locations are random and change every round, which unfortunately means that at the beginning or end of the game a given location can be totally useless.  None of the locations feel very powerful, so you don't get a whole lot of turn-to-turn satisfaction.  The theme is nice, so that'll probably be the selling point for most people.

Ex Libris is a game that emphasizes fun. The various asymmetric librarians add a fun twist to each play, and the ever changing worker placement spaces support malleable strategies. Unfortunately, Ex Libris seems to overshoot its target audience. The game is a bit too heavy to introduce to virgin gamers, but not strategic enough for core gamers. Additionally, while variety is present in spades, each game plays out in a similar fashion. And while the art quality is high, it lacks functionality which further reduces its accessibility.

[b]Sold 12/10/2017[/b] - A good game marred with poor graphic design and development choices, and unclear and inconsistent ability text on the tiles.  I might go back if there were a second printing addressing some of the development issues, because the underlying game is good.  I also might have kept it if I didn't have a gazillion other worker placement games already.

This is a great game that will surprise you. Don't let the library theme fool you this game is packed with strategy, planning and luck. the details of the components are amazing as well, right down to the name of the books on the cards.

Didn't have the wow factor that I thought it would have.  The components are nice.   The text on the locations has to be a mess up.  The game play is actually ho-hum and reminiscent of a filler not a full game.  Decisions are mostly obvious and there is only obvious strategies.  Not a bad game but no desire to play again.

Worker placement game with scoring derived from player-area patterns, set collection, and secret goals. Low player interaction. Ho-hum. Could see this dropping to a 5.

PROS
-Special Assistant meeples are extremely cool, cardboard is thick, cards are high quality, and art was cute but not too cute.
-Some variability due to letter cards and locations.
-Multiple scoring considerations.

CONS
-Don't feel pressured to make alphabetized shelf or be that accurate.
-Despite variety of locations, few seemed to be that interesting.
-Special Assistant powers go from "AWESOME!" to "I guess that's not bad."

Ex Libris is a a spacial tile (card) laying game game with light worker placement actions. The puzzle of building a bookshelf is the best part, ensuring alphabetical order, shelf support, wanted/unwanted categories, and set collection. The worker placement is passable, though. Each location has an action that is more complex than needed with very small text describing the action. The shelf building is enough fun to counteract the loss of enjoyment from placing workers. If a group could commit multiple plays to become familiar with the locations, Ex Libris shines.

Fantastic worker placement game. I think it really shines with just two players; it's enough to be competitive without taking away any fun by limiting your options. In my opinion it was very simple to pick up. I like the variety in the different locations you can put your worker, and knowing that one option will be gone next turn. I also enjoy the variety in the special worker each player gets. Overall, a fun game for two players that is quick to learn.

Ex Libris has a great theme (the book titles are hilarious), but it fails to provide the strategic experience in the short duration for which it is aiming. There is too much guessing of what cards will become available to plan too far ahead. The constant rotation of available actions slow the game down (especially when new players are at the table) and many of these locations involve having good fortune in order to gain their benefits. This game would play faster with a regular group, but it wasn't deep enough to warrant repeat plays.

Light and swingy worker placement combined with interesting set collection mechanism. Lots of guaranteed replayability thanks to some smooth design choices. Suffers from poor graphic design; small font with a lot of text on location cards. The puzzle of making your set collection work is neat and entertaining, but it isn't enough to carry the game over the pain of the worker placement.

The visual design of the cards where your assistants go really needs some iconography to help you remember what each place does. The components are beautiful, the book titles are clever, and the special meeples are really cool, but the poor visual design on the worker placement cards affects gameplay and hurts the flow of the game. I wanted a little more player interaction than this offered, but maybe I shouldn't expect that from a game about shelving books... This wasn't a "let's play it again" game for me.

Mid-weight worker placement game with some nice ideas.

Cute game, looks great, but a bit too light for my tastes. Also, if it were actually what I'd kinda imagined at first blush, which is a real-time book alphabetizing game, that might have been interesting. Probably not, but I couldn't help but be disappointed that it didn't match my odd head canon.

We absolutely love this game. It is a great way for children to practice and master the alphabetical order. The mechanics are simple yet challenging, because of the decisions you have to make based on the cards you draft and that you have to try to guess what kind of cards the other player need in order to sum points on the final tally. We have fun while playing it and theme is a simple one but it works. Being a book-lover, I love it!

Love the theme and the book titles, so much fun and well done! I also really appreciate the score board - more games should do this. But the game play is clunky at best, with worker placement spots that are both very difficult to read and - once you do figure out what they say - quite often oddly convoluted/fiddly. Ditto for the player powers, which are just a bit weird. This game could have used a little more stream-lining and a lot more play-testing.

Surprisingly kind of enjoyable despite being
1. fiddly and overwrought
2. high variance
3. terribly designed -- annoying artwork, sometimes ambiguously-worded rules, tiny white text on yellow backgrounds on the tiles, and worst of all the deliberately obtuse numbering system for books which impacts the gameplay -- the books' rank is *per letter* instead of overall, so to determine which shelf the book should go on you have to do copious amounts of stupid arithmetic, or just wing it.
4. having a pasted-on theme that doesn't stand to scrutiny

The mechanics were novel and rather interesting, on one hand.  On the other, memorizing cards would give someone an advantage, which is a nuisance.  Overall, this is probably not my cup of tea though I'd try it again.

This game is a table hog.  Yes, the text is small and hard to read, but I think that is not a giant issue as the tiles will become familiar over the course of a game.  I'm not sure it's much fun.  It's pretty fiddly and some things are unclear.  I also at no time felt like I was shelving books.  Furthermore, who the heck would shelve books like this???  (All genres together, alphabetically.)  It was ok, but I could play again or not.

UPDATE: Played with 4 and with the special assistants - The game is better this way, but I still don't need to own it.

Excellent worker placement game where each player gets a character with a unique worker ability, the placement locations are all different and they change each round, all the while you're trying to arrange your bookshelf to maximize points.

This game looks gorgeous and at the end you can stare and look at your personal library and feel like you've accomplished something. The gameplay itself is rather bland in my opinion which is not that much more than a set collection game, though an enjoyable one. Our first game was rather long for the weight of the game since we had to learn all locations while they came in play. Also, the personal powers seem to be unbalanced in our game but time will tell. Overall, an interesting game but still on the fence. Rating might go up though - something I liked to play but I'm not starving for it. I expected more from this title.

I really thought this game would be designed for me. I enjoy putting things like books in order, but I'm not sure that building an entire game around that was such a good idea. As great as it looks, and as much as I like how dynamic the worker placement is, this game felt really dry. If the ordering of books was more like a mini-game, I think that this could have some real potential. As it is, I enjoyed Ex Libris, but have no desire to play again.

RATING: 1
NB: I've been in the book trade for 20 years, so I have FEELS about book-related issues. 1. Alphabetizing rare books? Seriously? That gets you points? 2. Shelf stability?! We're not college kids with cinder blocks here, nor are we collecting cuneiform tablets. 3. Your prestige is DIMINISHED by owning banned books?!?! Okay, look, if you'd said "discredited" books, or "pirated editions", or "miscopied" or "badly bound" or "missing first signature", I might have given this a pass. Or mold! That would be a great point-loss issue! Or "rebound in buckram with library markings"! But "banned"? And these categories of desirable books? Most didn't even exist during a time when truly artful book creation was being done, unless you want to argue that Laurence Sterne was the first metatextualist, and even he's kind of recent, or that Morte D'Arthur was fanfic (don't even talk to me).

All this aside? This is not an exciting game. Worker placement is a great mechanic in the right game, but this is... match the thing to the category and put it in order and maybe some of the art is cool (gelatinous cube tho? Not in my shop!), but overall, you're going to get at least this much out of the Oniverse, Pandemicana, Carcassonne, or hell, Killer Bunnies if you want your whimsy, or Set if you just like the concept at its core. If you love books, however, this will make you sad. I'm going to go look at the retheming suggestions now.

Ex Libris has a decent puzzle at its core, but I think the base game is too short, especially with 4 players, for that puzzle to become as interesting as it might be... I think at the very least players should play the "long" game described in the rules, so cards become at least somewhat difficult to place in the grid. Major deductions, too, for the fonts used on the worker placement tiles... They're nearly unreadable unless one picks the tile up, and I almost never complain about such things in games!

An ok game I suppose. Bad text on the action spaces makes it hard to read from across the table.

This game is such a clever tale on WP games... but every stylistic choice goes out of its way to alienate players, from slightly larger than normal box with zero need for the extra size, to the unbelievably tiny shadow-dropped text onto the art, to the unbalanced special assistants.  Adam’s first big game is good enough to squint past these gaps, but at $60USD people expect more from a company that’s frankly better than this.  As a result, the shine is fading fast from this oughta-be-diamond.

My wife gave up on trying to read the ridiculously small text even while wearing her glasses.  Took any possible fun we could’ve had completely out of the game.  Impossible to play in anything but a brightly lit  room with a magnifying glass.  How did this get past the design stage?  This is another one of these games that was overhyped before release and turned out to be a big letdown.  Designer releases a crib sheet for the small tiles which is completely ridiculous.  Why wasn’t this fixed before release?  There are so many games out there that are actually well-designed so we don’t have time to waste on games that put up a barrier. Sold.

Ex Libris is a worker placement game in which players are trying to build their library of fantastic books. Each player starts with one of a large number of factions, which turn one of the player's three workers into a unique token with a special ability. There are a variety of different places to put your workers that let you draw, place, and otherwise manipulate your cards; these places come on tiles that change every round. Cards that you collect have a number of different categories of books on them, in a certain part of the alphabet. To count at the end, books need to be placed in alphabetical order. They are scored for a common goal category, a common penalty category, a private goal category, and a variety factor. This game really has a lot of variety in it that made it a lot of fun. There are tons of factions and placement tiles, so the game is constantly changing. My big complaint about the game is that the tiles are very hard to read, especially at a distance.

Its a fun game and a really fun theme. The text on the action tiles is waaaaay too small. It ruined a lot of the experience for me. Also, there seems to be too much to keep track of for this weight of game IMO. Overall its good, but not great.

Very nice card laying game. Next step up from Dream Home with the same idea for placement. But, you need to arrange the book titles in order. Cards are marked and is very well done. Worker placement to help gain cards and play cards. Very nice game and on the wishlist.

In this game, you are placing your three workers on action spots with the goal of drawing and placing cards into your tableau, so that the cards wind up in letter order with same letter ties broken by printed number order. Your goal is to have an even amount of symbols in your tableau because you score for whichever symbol you wind up with the least of. One symbol is also a secret bonus point category for each player and one is assigned as a publicly known negative point category.

Each player gets a different special power. Many seem interesting, others seem underpowered, in particular any ability that doesn't come with inherent card draw as part of it's effect. Effects that draw you more than a single card without needing some card expenditure are rare if they even exist at all, so if your hand gets depleted and you don't have a player power that nets free cards, it seems like you are playing from a major disadvantage. Certain action spot effects also cause opponents to lose cards from their hands, which barely bothers the card-rich powered players, but seemed to cripple other players.

The worker placement action spots are randomly drawn from a deck of tiles each round, which makes meaningful planning between rounds nearly irrelevant. Some of the action spots also heavily benefit from being early in turn order. For example, in our game a player who gets a free card draw when someone places next to him took the first spot in an action tile which gives cards to each player who places into the hall each time any player uses the tile.

Component wise, each action tile comes with a block of nearly illegible text which describes the action on the tile. This adds a lot of time to the game checking and rechecking what the action spots do. The book cards are laid out so it's reasonably easy to see what symbols people have. However, in addition to the colors each book also has letters and numbers that describe the position it needs to be in relationship to the other cards in the tableau for it to qualify for scoring. The letters are somewhat visible. The numbers are impossible to see from across the table.

Overall, this is a mediocre set collection game with lots of extra randomness thrown in, poor components and uncomfortably balanced player powers. I hope to not play this again.

AWFUL text on the cards. Whoever made that design choice made it VERY difficult to read. What it really had going for it was the theme was cool, the art was beautiful, and the game play wasn't bad. A little too random for my liking though.

Went a little too long with a lot of pausing to read every new board that came out. Perhaps a bit too much work for how light the game turned out to be, despite how much I enjoyed the novel book collecting and organizing.

RATING: 3
Another game where the graphic design absolutely ruins gameplay. Art was emphasized over legibility/usability. The ability text on the boards is impossible to read unless you are holding them or leaning over the table to read them. We had to pass the boards around to each player every single round so they could read what the actual abilities were; and even then people were constantly needing to re-read them during the round to remember what they did. Aside from that, the overall game is pretty lackluster. Its a pretty weak worker placement game. There's a little bit of 'take-that' but nothing that really hurts anyone. The spacial puzzle element is easy enough to overcome that there's no real challenge to it. There are so many point scoring elements to track that it's not worth the time trying to figure out where you stand compared to your opponents. It's a light weight filler game that takes too long to play for the (lack of) enjoyment it provides. I'd rather play something a little more 'think-y' and 'puzzle-y' like Honsu; much easier to teach/play and more fulfilling.

Aug. 2017: Ok, this a tough one to judge.  I really liked most of it, but the graphic design of the action boards bugs me: The writing on the boards is small, with white writing on colored background.  And I'd prefer icons to words on the boards so that first time players wouldn't have to keep asking what they do.  It'd be one thing if the 4 boards stayed the same throughout the game, but there are 4 new ones every turn.

This game has a cool unique theme. I was very excited to have gotten a copy of this game. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that the game played out quite as well as I'd hoped. There were so many cards to be able to take that I never felt like I was hurting for anything. I also found it easy to avoid the cards with the banned books. I didn't play with the special player powers, but am worried that it would open the game up even more. I do like the puzzle of building your shelves in such a way that everything will fit and be alphabetical while also scoring a good amount of shelf stability points. It didn't seem to be a problem though. Especially since you get a "final round" and can use that to shelve stuff even if it will get flipped over, so that it will fill gaps and increase your shelf stability. All of that made it feel very light, which could be fine. However, it went a little long for a light game. Also, my light gamers will be put off and have trouble by the number of locations you can go to and the player powers. That puts this game in a tough position to get played from my collection. FYI - a simple 1 page printout from BGG that explains the locations fixes the small text issue, but it has to be referenced all the time. Hopefully I can give this one another try to see if anything was just an issue with our first game.

Was looking forward to this game since GenCon 2017. It was kind of a ho-hum game for me. I found that I didn't even use many of the tile abilities, which may have been in part to the fact that I couldn't read them without picking them up every time to inspect what they did. Mostly I just wanted to use the action on my main player board, and it worked out to where I had plenty of time to get done what I needed to get done, which is always something I get disappointed about in games. Not my favorite.

Enjoyable game with fun variable powers and clever book titles. As many have said, the text on the locations is hard to read and the variety in locations seems low. Most locations are a version of give up a book to get a book. The spatial element adds some strategy with which books you should get. I like it but I think the hype was too high for what the game actually is, a nicely themed straightforward worker placement game with a spatial bookshelf building element.

Great game: replay ability very high. Good humor in book titles. Variety of Special Assistants, location abilities and variable timing of their appearance, if at all and if they remain past one round, and scoring mechanisms.
The game needs individual tabulators to keep track of how many books are in the library, though AP inducer if public info; on the other hand, even more AP if AP opponent is checking out everyone else's totals -- so avoid playing this with AP players!

It’s a very simple game, really: Rack-O (get cards in sequence) with 3 levels (shelves) of cards, worker placement to drive the acquiring/placing/moving of cards, a bunch of special powers (per player, and at various building locations), set-collection, and more complicated scoring. The game end triggers when any player gets x cards on their shelves; then you do a bunch of final scoring (bonus points for having books of the public bonus category, more for books of your secret favorite category, negative points for having undesired books, points for having the most in each of the other categories[?], bonus for having a well-balanced display, etc.). Highest sum of VP from all the various categories wins.

Yeah, so calling it Rack-O is probably understating what's here. Unfortunately, to me it still basically feels like Rack-O! Once you’re familiar with the building tiles (which come into play in random order), this should be super quick. Until then, though, the text on the building tiles is painfully small, way too difficult to read, and definitely not worth the effort relative to the amount of game play here. A solid "Meh"!

+0.5 for the clever, unique, book titles!

This is a set collection and worker placement library themed game. You collecting books and shelving them in alphabetical order. Books are classified into 6 (?) categories. Scoring will be based on randomly selected scoring cards. Also, everyone is given a character as their worker, each with their own powers. I really wanted to like this game, but it fell flat. I just felt like I spent most of the game counting my symbols to determine which book was optimal to pick up :( Also the worker placement explanations were extremely difficult to read and not super intuitive.

I love the idea but the execution for me falls short. I can't stand what I call "squinting" games, in which you are constantly having to peer across the table to read a block of nearly-illegible text on multiple cards/tiles to figure out which option to choose.  It also irks me thematically that librarians want to avoid "banned books" when in fact librarians are the champions of banned books. The game also seems a bit long for what it is.

The strategy element of Ex Libris is surprising and rewarding. Our group loved this. The book titles alone are hilarious!

Essen 2017. First play (4 players) was a bit of a let down for me, hated the amount of downtime. That downtime wasn't caused by the game mechanics, but by very poor decisions of the publisher on the graphics: text on the locations is very hard to read, so we had to consult the locations from closer by, or check the rulebook, which killed the flow of play. 
Mechanics wise, it is a classic worker placement. But I love the asymmetric player powers, and the shelving adds an interesting twist. 
Like it, would play again, but not with players new to the game.

Ex Libris was a hot game at this year's GenCon. The game looks fantastic, the spatial puzzle of building a shelf is pretty interesting, and the manner in which action spaces enter and leave the game should add a ton of replayability.

In Ex Libris, you are a collector of rare and valuable books in a thriving fantasy town. You draft cards that represent books and you work to shelve these books into your library based on several criteria including alphabetical order, shelf stability, prominent works, and variety of work types. Make sure to check out the book titles because there are over 500 unique names that the designer created for each of the books. In order to get book cards, you place assistants and one of them has variable player powers. There are 12 assistants that have unique powers and each of these has their own meeple. The interesting theme combined with great art and well-balanced mechanics makes for a great experience!

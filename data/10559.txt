RATING: N/A
Fun party game. Creative minds can really have a good time making up the statements in this. The only issue I see with it (and it is a problem with many party games), is that non-creative or shy people just won't have as good of a time with it.

RATING: 7
Out of all the games in my collection I think the rating on this one is the most unstable.  After one game with the right crowd I absolutely adore the game and want to play it again immediately.  But when I play with people who aren't into the spirit of the game, it can really make me miserable.  So that's what you need to realize if you're considering this game.

It will work best with players who can laugh at things that sometimes make no sense.  It also is better when players are getting tired.  The punchlines tend to build on one another and that will just increase the humor.  It will flop badly if played with serious people who are looking for sensible punchlines that make sense.  If you have a group that can really loosen up, this game is great for you. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Not a bad game, but party games with a limited audience aren't a good idea.  In this case, the limited audience is one which has a sense of humor attuned to making up punchlines to random categories on the fly.  I'm not one of those people and I know a lot of others who fit in this category.

RATING: 6
This is a goofy game!  This is serious "Outside the box" thinking!  And it takes being in a really goofy, yet creative mood!   If your not in the right mood or mind set, this can be a bit challenging!  But some times, coming up with something you think is really stupid might make everyone Crack up!  So it can be hilarious!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
It was fun, had some great laughs, but it's not as accessable as Apples to Apples (more thinking involved).  I think Apple to Apple cards would also work with this game.

update:  Unlesss you have a bunch of people it can get dull if noone is being very creative.  Game is losing it's luster.

This game can be really funny with the right group of people.

RATING: 6
It's about what one would expect from a game with this name.  Initial rating 6.

Update Apr 2011:   My initial feeling of this game was positive, but I think I was dragged down a bit by the reaction of other players (JT and Dave).  

Our second play was much better though, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves.  Some of the things that came out were pretty funny.

So, I think this game entirely depends on the group you have and whether the personalities mix well.  You really do need to just write stuff down -- even the weirdest things can come out sounding really funny.

Rating improved from a 6 to an 8, and I'd like to get a copy of this.   This, like Dixit, is a game that I could play often.

RATING: 4
Hardest game I have ever played. You feel very stupid playing this, and the answers generally are not funny. I played this with some very witty people, and everyone struggled. I felt much better when I looked at the 'Why did the Geek?' games and saw that only about 1 in 5 answers are even remotely funny, and those are people who chose to answer!  Either the jokes are extremely obvious or the nouns are so unrelated that you have to come up with nonsense. It gets a 5 because maybe once a round, someone comes up with something extremely clever, and when its you, it is incredibly satisfying. Beyond Balderdash is MUCH better.

Q: "What happened when the SUN turned into a GORILLA?" A: It got dark. I really like this game and premise. But it is very hard to be funny for most people. Creativity and wit required.

Still don't have a group for this locally, but I have been thinking about this lately and wondering about trying to do it remotely. The challenges would be distributed and people would have a little time to work with them and then we could use Facebook or Google hang-out to exchange answers.

Come up with funny answers to randomly generated questions: "Why is a (noun) like a (other noun) ?"  "What do you get when you cross a (noun)  with (other noun) ?" and so forth.  Fun greatly depends on who you play it with.

RATING: 7
Components: All components are functional; little could be done to improve them. Pencils and pads of paper included. The box could be smaller.

Experience: More entertaining than I thought it would be. It's amusing to hear what my fellow players come up with and what the judges select. Similar to The New Yorker Cartoon Game, but the language-based (rather than picture-based) inspiration leads to a greater variety of responses.

I think this might appeal to those who 'think' they are funny, but true humor isn't so systematic. I guess to the dilettantes, it seems like a vehicle for creating humor on the fly. In fact, it only instigates their delusional notions of being funny and annoying the rest of us.

Caveat - I'm not really a party game person, so party games will rarely rate more than a 7 with me.  Those who appreciate the genre more will rate it higher.  Similar to Apples to Apples in mechanics but this one requires more creativity which makes it more difficult but potentially even more fun.  I'd definitely recommend to those who like party games.

RATING: N/A
From the publisher's website:

What makes you laugh? More important, what makes your friends laugh? 

Each round, you'll have two minutes to create funny answers for a randomly generated riddle. But know your audience: One player will be judging answers instead of writing them! The judge's choices for the two best answers earn points. When the game's over, tally up your points to see who's the life of the party. 

Give it a whirl! How would you answer the question: 

What do you get when you cross a lion with a pizza? 

Or if you were the judge, which two of these answers would you reward? 

-Pride in Service 
-Could I have that with extra antelope? 
-A real meat-lovers pizza! 
-In the jungle, the quiet jungle, the pizza sleeps tonight.... 
-Extra cheese, pepperoni, hold the courage 
-Junk food that people are scared to eat 

Why Did the Chicken...? is a party game for 4 to 8 players, ages 12 and up. Each game lasts 30–60 minutes, but we hope when it ends you will want to . . . play again!

RATING: 5
I want to like this more, because I am friends with the designer, but it is really hit or miss for me.  It quite often ends up making me feel lame.  The problem is that you are TRYING to make jokes, so the humor can sometimes feel forced.  

It's a great concept, and implemented well, but in reality, it only works with a small subset of people.

RATING: 3
After 1 play, which I hope will be all this ever gets: This game falls squarely into a category of games I dislike, namely party games in which you have to creatively make things up (like Balderdash).  Once in a while someone comes up with something genuinely funny, but mostly it just generates random lameness.  This might be for someone, but not for me.

RATING: 8
Fun party game that can also be played casually or in groups.  Like Balderdash, but players come up with punchlines to random riddles instead of dictionary definitions (judging is done Apples-to-Apples style).  Needs the right crowd, but if you have people with a wacky sense of humour it's a blast.  

Suggested house rule: have judge pick two question cards and four nouns, and make his preferred question.  Also can play in groups/teams of several players (and have two judges from two groups each pick their two favourites, but not their own - see suggested rules [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/633994/rules-for-playing-in-groups-and-with-larger-number]here[/url]), or casually without keeping track of points, just for the laughs.

RATING: 7.5
An excellent party game for witty people and creative writers. I've been surprised by how easy it is to come up with funny punchlines to random jokes like: "What do a bowling ball and a librarian have in common", or "Why is a tongue better than a whale?"

RATING: 6
An easy game to learn, but hard to master.  The insurmountable combinations of joke "parameters" makes this game fun every time.

The down side to this game, however, is that some people might be discouraged when they cannot come up with a witty answer - that's when you have to encourage them to just write anything down!  Sometimes the completely irrelevant answers are the best!

funny group game?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If your group is naturally funny, this game will be outstanding - making funny people even funnier.  If your group is naturally withdrawn, I imagine this game would be terrible.  It's better if the group has some context to use inside jokes.  A "reader" who is naturally funny makes the game more fun for everyone.

It's like playing the board game version of amateur stand up comedy.  There will be a few truly funny jokes, more bad puns than you can imagine, and plenty of just plain bad, stupid, and dumb jokes, with some of them completely devoid of meaning.  It's up to your group to determine how these ratios will end up.

RATING: 6
Ideal Players: 5-7

Description: Players compete to come up with the best punchline for a joke.

Pro: Significant replayability via different word combinations. Running gags quickly develop. Hilarity limited only by the players' imaginations.

Con: Requires creative, funny, playful players. Some jokes just don't have a good punchline. People can get offended if their punchlines are not picked.

This requires a decent amount of imagination and wit but sometimes even the dumbest answers can be hilarious.

This game is completely TRANSPARENT, meaning it will rise to the heavens or sink to the bottom of the earth depending entirely on the people you play it with. Loose creative fast thinkers will love this whereas stiff types will despise it. It's really an excellent game, but you have to choose your audience very carefully...

Initial Rating 5.0 (October 2010)

I liked the game at first, with the right crowd this can be very fun, but what kills the game for me is the judging, I can´t pass the fact that you can judge subjectively in any way you want, for me it is important to establish a defined score, a way to earn the victory. With this game the judge can decide in any way he sees fit so for example in one of our games, there was a couple of friends who always voted for each other, or another time there was a player who was clearly the best at the game but nobody voted for him because he would have won the game.

This problem could be fixed if the submissions were made secret (a la Dixit and Balderdash), I have not tried this variant yet and I sold the game so it will be a long time until I play this again if ever.

Other games that don’t work for me due to the judging are Telestrations, In a Pickle and Apples to Apples.

Current Rating: 2.5

I have played the game a couple of times more. To play the game I insist we play with secret answers so the judge won’t know who wrote what (I now think this is in the rules). Still the game isn’t very fun for me because of the subjective judging I wrote before.

I will play the game from time to time, but I always offer considerable resistance to the proposal.

RATING: 7.5
This is an interesting game for those that can get past actually having to write something, and that can overcome the thought that they can't be funny.  You'd be surprised at how many decent to actual laugh out loud jokes a group can come up with.  Note, some of the combos seemed to lend themselves better then others to jokes, but even with the duds its a very social game where people can poke fun at the duds and spin their own non-game  written jokes on the answers.  We had 7 players and limited the jokes to 2 per person so they game didn't take to long and make it seem like people had to keep writing, it worked for us because ones 2 best jokes are better then 8 bad ones.  I recommend this for social creative people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
This is a pretty fun one and allows for a good amount of creativity.  Sadly though, some of the choices that come up don't make for very good jokes or cause a good amount of strain with coming up with anything that could be even remotely funny.  Also, this game fails as many of these games do with having to repeat punchlines quite often to the point where, they're no longer funny (if they even were in the first place).  A game I would play again for sure but, wouldn't play with more than 6 and thing 4 and 5 are perfect numbers for it.

Better in concept than practice.  A randomized riddle is created using a question card and two noun cards.  Eg, How do you make a *slug* more like a *disc jockey*?  Players then write funny answers and have them judged.  Unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to make some of these things funny - but of course it's all about the people.  Unlike, say, Apples to Apples, this game requires genuine creativity.

This is a great idea for a game, but it's one that I just can't play.  I don't find myself funny, so putting myself under time pressure to come up with a joke means that I sit there and can't figure out any kind of punch line at all.  But it's still fun to participate, since people will come up with some pretty hilarious answers.

I had (very) high expectations for this game befoe playing it.  It lived up to those expectations.

First time playing was with thre other people; one or two of them didn't seem too excited after hearing the game description.  But by the end of the first round (each of us had been the judge one time), we all wanted a second.

I think it got even more fun during the second round.

Both clever and also stupid-goofy answers are both highly appreciated.

The game we played was hilarious--is that because the game is funny?  Is it because the structure of the game brings out the funny side of its players?

Totally based on the capacity of the players to be creative and witty. Some combinations of questions and names lend themselves better to the fun, but their creation is random.

Quick and fun.  I had the pleasure of being shown this game by designer Kory Heath at Origins (2005) this year (thanks for autographing the box!), and had to take a copy home.  Very light, always fun, but you definitely can't play with people who lack a sense of humor or an ounce of creativity.

Rating lowered since it rarely sees play, and has become sort of stale.

This game is right up my alley. It's like apples to apples, but you get to make your own jokes/responses up as you play. Therefore the player responses can be as clean or as dirty as the group wants, depending on who is playing.

Worst teaching experience ever: showing a devout Baptist the game and randomly pulling out the riddle combination: "How is a sailor like a screwdriver?"

Other than that, this game has brought me nothing memorable.

Great idea for a game.  I really enjoy this one...now if only I can get people to play when they are not totally drunk out of their minds.  I always bring this one out at the end of the evening.

We all laughed our asses off, but I don't think enough time went into the creation of the questions and nouns.  And it's quite an expensive game for such low production quality.

RATING: 7.5
A game where a joke is randomly created and its up to everyone to write their own punchline, then people vote on their favorite answers and the one with the most votes at the end wins.

RATING: 6
Possibly a 5, depends so much on the people. Not as good as Wise & Otherwise because 'on demand funny' is much harder than 'just off the wall'. Maybe drinking etc would help (and many players).

RATING: 5
Language based party game - develop a punch line to a bad joke

The primary goal is to have a good time - the game is as good as the players imagination.

Just not clever enough, as is the case with most people who play the game.

No, sorry.  A game where you have to make up jokes on the spot from cards that are drawn.  Forced humour at the best of times; often the reaction was just puzzled silence.

RATING: N/A
I have never had more fun with any game. 
Since I started helping Kory in testing this game, I've had more laughs than I can count. (And I can count at least to 47!)
I still play this game at every opportunity and still have uproarious killer fun like it's the first time.
(update: it's 9/2005 and I still love the game!)

Based on one play.  We cut the game short because everyone else--and I mean *everyone* else--hated it.  Two of the players were literally in tears with laughter, and still they hated it!  Does that make any sense?

RATING: 6
A game similar in vein to "Balderdash" in that it has players generating answers, however there is no "correct" answer - the judge for the round merely chooses which two he finds the most clever/funny/etc. The game is not quite as accessible as the aforementioned game - or others like it such as "Malarkey", "Wise Or Otherwise", etc. - due to the fact that the task of creating an answer is a little too open, therefore creative people will excel while other not-so-creative people will struggle. In conclusion, this game is quite fun and enjoyable if the group you play with are all rather creative people, but if you have a rather diverse group, you may be best to stick with the other similar games I previously mentioned. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I imagine this game would be much more interesting as a game if the players actually played it by the rules instead of just choosing a funny statement that was only partially related to the requirements of the card in question.  (It is quite likely that I could be wrong.)  Unfortunately, this is a feature of many games that are similar to this.  And if you are playing as an ice-breaker or socially or just for laughs, that is fine I suppose.  Unfotunately, when it is proposed as a "game", some people will actually want to play the real "game" and not some other game.  Overcoming this bit of paradox in this style of game is one of the reasons that I beleive Balderdash is such a great game.  [02/17/2008]

Why Did the Chicken...? -- I find the downtime for reading answers aloud (then re-reading them to narrow the selection) a weakness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Drawbacks:

-Cheap components
-People who aren't creative will refuse to play or play grudgingly and lose horribly

RATING: 7
The prospect of having to come up with punchlines to jokes seems to intimidate most people, but after a few rounds you really get the hang of it and things pick up substantially. "Just one more round" seems to be the feeling in the room as the game reaches its finish. If you need a party game in your collection this is an interesting option.

Example of a punchline that I would laugh at:
Q: What's the difference between a cheetah and a pimple?
A: You can't change your spots, but you can pop your zits lots!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.4
Fun party game and really worth it when someone comes up with that really funny punchline. Unfortunately the rest of the time can be a bit ho-hum!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.689
Neat idea, but you really need to play this one with the right group.  

Tip: Sometimes the best punchlines can be essentially meaningless or refer to an earlier joke, conversation, or news item.

Really funny game, and with the right mix of people, it is outright hilarious. Every game I laugh so hard I cry.

Apples to Apples variant that involves writing.  In a very similar boat to Say Anything, so your enjoyment of the game depends a lot on the creativity of the people you play against.

A party game I actually like!  The premise is excellent, although I think a house rule may be helpful.  I'm not sure about submitting multiple answers, although I could live with that.  Plays fast and there are a lot of laughs.  Of course, the right group always helps.

I found that this game needs to be played by people that are witty.  The more of a smartass you are, the better you will play.  Needless to say, I really enjoy this game, but for those who are not so good with top of the head funny remarks, it may be simply too difficult.

-Upgraded from 8 to 9.  I just spent over an hour and a half laughing my ass off without stopping for a break.  One of the best times I can remember playing games.

RATING: 8.5
This is a make-shtuff-up game, right along the lines of "Beyond Balderdash" and "Quip It!", which are two of my favourite party games.  My comments for those 2 games pretty much apply to this one - I love the improvisational creative writing which requires some wittiness, but for others it is a painful and tedious exercise.  With the right group, this is very good, light-hearted fun and a lot of laughs.  I'm all about the laughs!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 8.5/10

This one was pretty entertaining, but it does require a certain crowd, and the more creative the group, the better this game would be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I thought I would love this, but turns out it's too stressful and difficult to be funny with a time limit. The fact it's a party game certainly doesn't help, because you want a party game just to be easy. This one is not, when you're trying to be creative in such a short time. Everyone had a few good ones, but mostly we didn't come up with hilarious answers that quickly. If I play this again, we will make an activity out of it and just forget the sand timer. We'll just have a good time and give everyone time to come up with hilarious answers, continuing the game when everyone is done. That said, it kinda seizes to be a game and becomes an activity.

In every game like Apples to Apples or Balderdash, people eventually stop pursuing the object of the game and start trying to be funny instead. "Why Did the Chicken...?" is brilliant because being funny IS the object of the game.

I would rate "Why Did the Chicken...?" a 10, but it has 2 major drawbacks:

1) It is HARD to be funny about random nouns and questions. I  really enjoy the challenge, and it's a great opportunity to exercise your creativity. But some people do not like being challenged in this way and will hate playing this kind of game.

2) Because it is hard, I'm not always in the mood to play it. I like an easy game every once in awhile too.

Its a fun party type game.  It needs people with a sense of humor and a flair for the ridiculous. Creates some good laughter, the trick I'm sure is not to over play this one.  Unfortunately, nobody in my gaming group makes me laugh.  They are very boring people.  I do think this punchline works 90% of the time however.  Two Words: Portable Hole.

I would rate it higher, but I get irrationally irritated when someone is so foolish as to incorrectly judge that my joke wasn't the best...

Nevertheless, very good as party games go. Understand, when I say this, that I generally dislike party games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a great party game, but it requires a lot of creative thinking. Players come up with funny one-liners or stories when two nouns are randomly placed together with a question with two blanks for the nouns, such as "why is a blank better than a blank" or "why was the blank afraid of the blank." One judge each turn chooses the funniest/best two answers and the players that wrote them each score a point.

What makes you laugh? More important, what makes your friends laugh?
\13\\13\
Each round, you'll have two minutes to create funny answers for a randomly generated riddle. But know your audience: One player will be judging answers instead of writing them! The judge's choices for the two best answers earn points. When the game's over, tally up your points to see who's the life of the party.
\13\\13\
Give it a whirl! How would you answer the question:
\13\\13\
What do you get when you cross a lion with a pizza?
\13\\13\
Or if you were the judge, which two of these answers would you reward?
\13\\13\
-Pride in Service
\13\-Could I have that with extra antelope?
\13\-A real meat-lovers pizza!
\13\-In the jungle, the quiet jungle, the pizza sleeps tonight....
\13\-Extra cheese, pepperoni, hold the courage
\13\-Junk food that people are scared to eat

I'm torn with Why Did The Chicken...?  I had fun playing it, lotsa laughs...and not much game.  Plus I'm pretty bad at it.  That's OK.  I'm willing to give it another chance or two before I write it off.  A tentative rating of "6", with more plays to give the true rating later.
